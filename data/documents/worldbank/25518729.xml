Executive Summary                                                                                                    15-year-olds prior to the 1999 reform persist today in upper secondary educa on, where the performance of&#13;
Facing the prospects of rapid demographic aging and decline over the coming decades, Poland needs a highly           students in voca onal upper-secondary schools trails that of their peers in general educa on. Moreover, Polandâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
skilled workforce to help generate the produc vity growth that it needs to fuel con nued convergence of its living   performance in problem solving in the 2012 PISA was well below the OECD average. Lastly, equity remains an issue&#13;
standards with those of its West European neighbors.                                                                 in need of further a en on: The diï¬&#128;erence in mathema cs performance between the top and bo om quin les&#13;
                                                                                                                     are the equivalent of nearly three years of schooling â&#128;&#147; a wider gap than the OECD average and much wider&#13;
Skilling up the workforce starts with equipping youth with the right cogni ve and socio-emo onal founda on           than in other top-performing countries such as Japan and Korea. While Polandâ&#128;&#153;s school system today is not very&#13;

and economic growth: cogni ve skills, such as literacy, numeracy, and crea ve and cri cal thinking or problem-       performance.&#13;
solving; socio-emo onal skills and behavioral traits, such as conscien ousness, grit, and openness to experience;&#13;
and job- or occupa on-speciï¬&#129;c technical skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. Cogni ve and socio-&#13;
emo onal skill forma on starts early in a personâ&#128;&#153;s life. Good cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills provide a&#13;
necessary founda on for the subsequent acquisi on of technical skills. Put diï¬&#128;erently, poor literacy and numeracy&#13;
skills severely undermine a personâ&#128;&#153;s ability to beneï¬&#129;t from further training and lifelong learning.&#13;
&#13;
An impressive transforma on in cogni ve skills has occurred among youth in Poland. This report focuses on&#13;
cogni ve skills. It examines results for Poland from the Program for Interna onal Student Assessment (PISA), which&#13;
assesses the mathema cs, reading, and science competencies of 15-year-olds. The ï¬&#129;ndings point to an impressive&#13;
transforma on in the cogni ve skill set of the youth in Poland between 2000 and 2012. Poland raised its scores in&#13;
mathema cs, reading, and science to the equivalent of what students would have learned in one addi onal year of&#13;
schooling. Its PISA scores are now above the OECD average and at the same levels as in countries such as Finland&#13;
and Germany.&#13;
&#13;
Aggregate gains in quality have gone hand in hand with improvements in educa onal equity. Poland has seen&#13;
an increase in the propor on of its students at the top performance level, and the share of its students who are&#13;
poor performers has declined. Students from poor and well-oï¬&#128; socioeconomic backgrounds alike saw performance&#13;
improvements. All this has been achieved with stable levels of educa on spending, at about 5 percent of GDP and&#13;
below the OECD average.&#13;
&#13;
The overall eï¬&#128;ects of reform on Polandâ&#128;&#153;s PISA scores has been posi ve, although isola ng the precise impact of&#13;
each reform element is diï¬&#131;cult. Given the many educa on (and non-educa on) reforms in Poland since the early&#13;
1990s, it is diï¬&#131;cult to isolate the eï¬&#128;ects of each element of reform on Polandâ&#128;&#153;s PISA results. The overall eï¬&#128;ects&#13;
are clearly posi ve. In addi on to changes in the accountability arrangements with a strengthening of the role of&#13;
local governments and the introduc on of standardized examina ons, the Polish authori es introduced a change&#13;
to the structure of the educa on system in 1999, which delayed selec on between general and voca onal tracks&#13;
and eï¬&#128;ec vely added one year of exposure to general curriculum content. Taking eï¬&#128;ect a er the ï¬&#129;rst PISA test in&#13;
2000, when Poland performed rela vely poorly, this change has been rigorously evaluated and shown to have had&#13;
a signiï¬&#129;cant posi ve eï¬&#128;ect on performance.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the many successes, some challenges remain, par cularly regarding problem-solving skills and equity in&#13;
achievement. There is evidence from PISA assessments replicated for older students in upper-secondary educa on&#13;
in 2006, 2009 and 2012 that performance gaps previously found between voca onal and general schools for&#13;

How can Poland achieve convergence in living standards with its Western European neighbors when its                    youth are leaving the compulsory educa on system with the right set of skills needed for further educa on and&#13;
popula on is aging and shrinking? Polandâ&#128;&#153;s income growth over the last two decades has been remarkable, but            training and for produc ve employment. It ï¬&#129;nds that Poland has made major strides in raising the skills of the next&#13;
the country s ll has a long way to go to catch up with the living standards of its EU15 neighbors. In 1995, Polandâ&#128;&#153;s   genera on and to prepare them for the demands of a growing and changing economy.&#13;
GDP per capita stood at about 37 percent of the EU15 average, and by 2013 it had risen to 66 percent (Figure 1).&#13;
Looking ahead, Polandâ&#128;&#153;s long-term economic growth prospects are put at risk by demographic change: According           The importance of cognitive skills&#13;
to United Na ons projec ons, the working-age (ages 15 to 64) share of the popula on is expected to fall from 69.5      Interna onal evidence shows how much the skills of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s workforce ma er for economic growth&#13;
percent in 2015 to 57 percent by 2050. In contrast, the share of the popula on 65 and above will increase from         and shared prosperity. Interna onal evidence suggests that quality of educa on is one of the most important&#13;
15.3 percent in 2015 to 29 percent by 2050.1 With fewer workers and more old-age dependents, labor produc vity         determinants of long-term economic growth.2 Recent research (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2007 and 2012),&#13;
improvements will be key to sustained economic growth.                                                                 drawing on student assessment surveys from 1960 onward, es mates that an improvement of 50 points in scores&#13;

Snapshot of Polandâ&#128;&#153;s performance in PISA&#13;
Polandâ&#128;&#153;s 15-year-olds performed strongly in mathema cs, reading, and science in 2012. Polandâ&#128;&#153;s scores were&#13;
above the OECD country average in all subjects: mathema cs (518 points), reading (518 points), and science (526&#13;
points) (Figure 5). Poland scored well above the OECD average in mathema cs and at par with countries such as&#13;
Germany and Finland. These rapid improvements in PISA scores make Poland an interes ng case to examine.&#13;

The signiï¬&#129;cant gains in Polandâ&#128;&#153;s PISA scores have extended across three dis nct phases. First, Poland saw&#13;
signiï¬&#129;cant improvements between 2000 and 2003. Its scores presented a broadly stable picture between 2003&#13;
and 2009, followed by another signiï¬&#129;cant jump between 2009 and 2012 (Figure 6). The aggregate increases for&#13;
reading, mathema cs and science across the en re period are around 40 points, the equivalent of one year of&#13;
instruc on. What have been the drivers of the sudden improvements in performance between 2000 and 2003 and&#13;
between 2009 and 2012? While evidence shows a causal link between the ï¬&#129;rst jump and the 1999 reform, with its&#13;
extension of general educa on by one year due to the introduc on of the comprehensive lower secondary schools&#13;
(Jakubowski et al., 2010), no causal evidence has been found to explain the 2009-2012 improvements. However,&#13;
one credible hypothesis is that the changes in curriculum and student assessment led to improvements in cogni ve&#13;
skills, with students tested in 2012 having completed three years of lower secondary educa on under the new&#13;
curriculum (see also Marciniak, 2015, and Jakubowski, 2015).&#13;

However, there is evidence that performance stra ï¬&#129;ca on emerges in upper-secondary educa on that is similar&#13;
to the pre-1999 situa on. In addi on to 15-year-olds in grade 9, the PISA test has also been administered to grade&#13;
10 students in upper-secondary educa on in 2006 and 2009. Analysis using the data for the grade 10 test shows&#13;
signiï¬&#129;cant performance varia on between voca onal and general upper-secondary schools and a high share of&#13;
students in basic voca onal secondary schools performing below level 2 in the PISA test (ChÅ&#130;oÅ&#132;-DomiÅ&#132;czak and&#13;
Federowicz (2014). The evidence of a re-emergence of such performance gaps in upper-secondary educa on&#13;
was one reason the authori es decided to introduce an iden cal curriculum in the ï¬&#129;rst year of upper-secondary&#13;

socioeconomic status, and (ii) the PISA score gap between top and bo om ESCS quin les.1 Figure 15 summarizes&#13;

Performance gaps also remain between students in urban and rural areas and between girls and boys. Even&#13;
though performance variance between schools is lower than in other countries within schools, school loca on s ll&#13;
ma ers: The PISA score gaps between students in urban and rural areas account for the equivalent of almost one&#13;
year of schooling. Meanwhile, girls outperform boys in reading, but not in mathema cs. However, evidence from&#13;
the Progress in Interna onal Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) in 2006 and 2011 evidence suggests a narrowing of the&#13;
gap in grade 4.&#13;

to be geared toward achieving this objec ve (with implica ons for teacher professional development) and these&#13;
skills need to be captured in student assessment.                                                                    Early childhood educa on has been shown worldwide to be a key tool to improve opportuni es for&#13;

Polandâ&#128;&#153;s social assistance system for low-income families is under review. Polandâ&#128;&#153;s social assistance system&#13;
comprises a considerable number of permanent and temporary cash and in-kind programs, mostly means-tested&#13;
and with diï¬&#128;ering objec ves that include poverty reduc on, support to families, and support to people with&#13;
disabili es. There are also signiï¬&#129;cant, well-targeted child tax credits to low-income families. Social assistance&#13;
overall, as well as the biggest beneï¬&#129;t program, the family allowance, are well targeted, but they suï¬&#128;er from low&#13;
coverage of the poorest households and low adequacy in their beneï¬&#129;t levels. As a result, the poverty reduc on&#13;
impact is limited. This suggests the need to examine the overall eï¬&#128;ec veness of the social assistance system,&#13;
especially from the perspec ve of poor families with children. Polandâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Labor&#13;
and Social Policy are in fact engaged in a spending review exercise focusing on strengthening ï¬&#129;nancial assistance to&#13;
low income families.&#13;

            Poland - Skilling up the next generation :
            an analysis of Poland’s performance in the program for
            international student assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Facing the prospects of rapid
            demographic aging and decline over the coming decades,
            Poland needs a highly skilled workforce to help generate the
            productivity growth that it needs to fuel continued
            convergence of its living standards with those of its West
            European neighbors. Skilling up the workforce starts with
            equipping youth with the right cognitive and socio-emotional
            foundation skills. International research has identified
            three dimensions of skills that matter for good employment
            outcomes and economic growth: cognitive skills, such as
            literacy, numeracy, and creative and critical thinking or
            problem solving; socio-emotional skills and behavioral
            traits, such as conscientiousness, grit, and openness to
            experience; and job- or occupation-specific technical
            skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. This
            report focuses on cognitive skills. It examines results for
            Poland from the program for international student assessment
            (PISA), which assesses the mathematics, reading, and science
            competencies of 15-year-olds. The overall effects of reform
            on Poland’s PISA scores have been positive, although
            isolating the precise impact of each reform element is
            difficult. There is evidence from PISA assessments
            replicated for older students in upper-secondary education
            in 2006, 2009 and 2012 that performance gaps previously
            found between vocational and general schools for
            15-year-olds prior to the 1999 reform persist today in upper
            secondary education, where the performance of students in
            vocational upper-secondary schools trails that of their
            peers in general education.
