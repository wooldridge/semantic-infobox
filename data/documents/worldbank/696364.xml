Technical Annex&#13;
Page I of 18&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Bosnia Herzegovina's (BH) prewar population of 4.4 million was predominantly rural&#13;
with only 18 percent living in urban areas. This population was housed in an estimated 1,295,000&#13;
units or approximately the same as the total number of households. The housing stock was of&#13;
relatively high quality with about 90 percent of it built after the Second World War. As in many&#13;
formerly socialist countries, single-family homes built by the owners with traditional&#13;
technologies characterized the rural landscape. Over half the stock in the largest cities was in the&#13;
form of publicly owned housing stock or "public sector housing" consisting of multi-family&#13;
medium and high-rise brick or prefabricated panel housing and some older nationalized&#13;
apartment buildings. Overall, about 80 percent of the stock was privately owned with the&#13;
majority of that being in rural areas and smaller towns where almost all housing was private.&#13;
2.    Four years of war have had a devastating effect on housing conditions and caused&#13;
massive displacement of the population. An estimated half of the housing has been damaged and&#13;
about 6 percent destroyed in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many households are&#13;
living in units damaged by shells, while others have had to be housed in private and public sector&#13;
housing or in crowded shelters. War damage to housing has been exacerbated by collateral&#13;
damage caused by weather conditions and the deterioration of infrastructure installations and&#13;
connections to networks. Some vacated houses have been deliberately burned and others have&#13;
been subject to looting of all windows, doors, internal fixtures and roof tiles.&#13;
J.    While the pattern of damage and destruction is unevenly spread, overall damage has been&#13;
extensive, estimated at US$4 billion for Federation territories alone. Detailed estimates of&#13;
damage are not available yet for the Republika Srpska but are likely to be comparable in certain&#13;
regions. Reconstruction of the stock will be spread over several years. Initial efforts should focus&#13;
on the most cost effective means of rapidly increasing the stock of serviceable housing to&#13;
improve living conditions, allowing the return of displaced populations to their homes and the&#13;
regeneration of war-affected communities.&#13;
4.    Complicating the issue of addressing housing needs are the dramatic changes in the&#13;
demographic distribution of the population. The war has resulted in an exodus of refugees to&#13;
other countries and massive population shifts internally. It is estimated that the pre-war population of&#13;
BH of 4.4 million has declined by about 1.0 million. In late 1995, the 3.4 million people in BH were&#13;
probably located roughly as follows: I million people reside in the Republika Srpska; the balance of 2.4&#13;
million live in the Federation. Of this total population, an estimated 1.5 million people have been&#13;
displaced from their homes. With the advent of peace, further demographic shifts are beginning to take&#13;
place as displaced people seek to return to their homes. However, some returnees may not be able to&#13;
reclaim their housing before alternative accommodations are found for families occupying their units;&#13;
others may not wish to return to their former homes. The varying ownership claims arising from these&#13;
situations will need to be addressed and may take some time to settle. However, it is clear that the repair&#13;
of housing cannot await the full clarification of ownership claims. Resettlement of the population and the&#13;
voluntary return of displaced populations, a key element of the implementation of the peace process, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

also constrained by the damage and destruction of housing underscoring the urgent need for housing&#13;
repair and reconstruction.&#13;
SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
5.    An emergency repair and reconstruction program for housing of about US$600 million&#13;
over three years was presented in a report on Reconstruction Priorities for BH, prepared by the&#13;
Bank and others, for consideration by the international donor community. The program called for&#13;
a phased approach focusing immediate attention on rapidly increasing the stock of serviceable&#13;
units to improve living conditions, allowing the return of displaced populations and free&#13;
additional units and resources that are being tied up in housing the displaced population.&#13;
6.    The program would start with a focus on repair of lightly damaged units in priority&#13;
communities which have suffered a high degree of damage but where the potential for resuming&#13;
economic activities and a return of displaced populations is high, in order to maximize the&#13;
number of units that could be made rapidly habitable. In a second stage the program would&#13;
address the reconstruction of housing to address needs in communities where housing demand&#13;
exceeds supply and deal with the more severely damaged units that require reconstruction rather&#13;
than repair. Beyond addressing the immediate and pressing war-related housing issues, the&#13;
program would begin the process of establishing a solid policy framework to sustain the&#13;
development of the sector over the medium to long term.&#13;
SECTOR ISSUES AND POLICIES&#13;
7.    Recovery of the housing sector will depend to a large extent on repair and reconstruction&#13;
of war damaged units, given that over half of the stock has been war affected. The uneven&#13;
distribution of damage and the uncertainty regarding final population movements and&#13;
resettlement makes it impossible to tell at this time which localities will have critical shortages&#13;
that cannot be addressed through repair of existing units. Nonetheless, there are a sufficient&#13;
number of viable communities that have suffered considerable damage and could benefit from&#13;
immediate attention to housing repair to improve living conditions and allow the return of&#13;
displaced populations.&#13;
8.    Additionally, a complex set of ownership issues has resulted from the war period which is&#13;
likely to affect the recovery of the sector. With the displacement of the population many&#13;
individuals are now living in units which do not belong to them. Returning owners may not be&#13;
able to reclaim their units without some form of alternative housing being made available to&#13;
present occupants. Ownership claims by individuals who may not wish to return to their homes,&#13;
or by those whose homes are currently occupied by other displaced families, will also need to be&#13;
addressed within the context of provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Housing of&#13;
displaced persons in vacated units has, of necessity, been undertaken in an ad hoc manner by&#13;
municipalities and will need to be regularized within a legal framework that allows for settlement&#13;
of claims made by the rightful owner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
9.    Beyond the immediate issues arising from the war, the recovery of the sector will depend&#13;
on reform of the previous socialist-based housing policies and regulatory framework and their&#13;
replacement with market-oriented policies. Outstanding issues to be addressed over the medium&#13;
term relate to the development of a legal and regulatory framework that encourages private&#13;
investment in housing and trading of housing as an asset; the development of a sustainable&#13;
source of long term-finance through the banking sector; rationalization and reduction of subsidies&#13;
for maintenance and development of the public sector housing stock; and ensuring an adequate&#13;
supply of developable land for housing and related infrastructure; reform of land development&#13;
regulations, privatization of land in urban areas and development of appropriate funding sources&#13;
for land development.&#13;
10.   The formal financing of housing has in the past depended largely on enterprises,&#13;
municipal or other social institutions' housing funds. These funds obtained resources from a 3&#13;
percent employee tax for the construction of public sector housing primarily in urban areas. The&#13;
resources of the funds financed construction and purchase of units which were then leased to&#13;
employees by public institutions. The ownership of public sector housing remained "socially&#13;
owned" by the sponsoring institution not the individual tenant whose contributions had financed&#13;
the development of this stock. As these enterprises seek to privatize, many will need to divest&#13;
themselves of the housing stock which they own.&#13;
11.   Maintenance of the public sector housing was the responsibility of municipal housing&#13;
organizations or enterprises. Minor maintenance expenditure were funded through maintenance&#13;
charges collected by the organizations. Municipalities funded the bulk of major maintenance&#13;
through funds obtained from enterprise housing funds. The funding of the public sector housing&#13;
stock repair and maintenance remains a problem due to the historically low charges for rental&#13;
housing and the low collection rates at this time. The substantial subsidies to this stock of&#13;
housing will, over the medium term, need to be reduced through sale of the units and rationalized&#13;
as the economy improves to allow rents and charges to cover the cost of maintenance and&#13;
ownership.&#13;
12.   While the formal financing system was geared primarily to the public sector housing&#13;
stock, the bulk of the housing was actually financed through private savings and remittances.&#13;
Very little credit was available for mortgage or construction finance to individuals, and the credit&#13;
which was available came primarily through loans from enterprises and some loans through the&#13;
banks. The absence of credit constrained the pace at which private housing development could&#13;
occur. In the medium term, it will be important to integrate housing finance with overall financial&#13;
sector development and develop a sustainable source of long-term housing finance.&#13;
13.   The basic legal framework governing housing consisted of the Housing Act of 1985&#13;
which dealt primarily with the components of a socialist housing financing and production&#13;
system. The law governed: a) the development of self-managed associations to finance both&#13;
provision and maintenance of the public sector housing stock; b) tenant associations for the&#13;
management of apartment blocks; c) rental rates and maintenance fees and their collection; d)&#13;
tenancy rights and conditions for their termination; e) the provision of enterprise financing for&#13;
housing; and f) housing standards. This law is still in force and the legal and regulatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
framework will need to be reviewed and revised to set the basis for a more market-oriented&#13;
housing sector, encourage private investment and trading of housing as an asset.&#13;
14.   The provisions of the law with respect to termination of contracts based on abandonment&#13;
of the unit or non-payment of rent have been used to make units available to house displaced&#13;
populations. Currently, there is draft legislation that attempts to privatize public sector housing&#13;
units. The basic provisions of this law would allow legal tenants to purchase their units. Even if&#13;
they are no longer occupying the unit, legal tenants would be allowed to purchase the unit so&#13;
long as they make their claims within an allotted time period. Several issues may confound the&#13;
speed at which privatization can proceed, including: a) the need for funding repair, rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of damaged units and the common elements of the building; b) occupancy of&#13;
rental units by displaced households; and c) determination of appropriate sales price and terms&#13;
for purchase considering that most of this housing was paid for by employee contributions, and a&#13;
substantial amount of it has deteriorated as a result of war-damage. In addition, housing&#13;
privatization efforts will need to take into account the strong tenancy rights which still remain in&#13;
force, and the low controlled rates charged for rental. All of these factors combined act as a&#13;
disincentive to the purchase of units.&#13;
15.   Despite a legal framework that emphasized the organization and structure of public sector&#13;
housing, most housing production was undertaken by private individuals. Private production&#13;
continued to account for the vast majority of new units through 1991, much of it with inadequate&#13;
associated infrastructure. The lack of coordination in housing and infrastructure development&#13;
will need to be overcome in the future through infrastructure upgrading.&#13;
HOUSING EMERGENCY PROGRAMS&#13;
16.   The need to move rapidly and restore lightly damaged units to a minimum habitable&#13;
standard has triggered much donor activity. As of May 1996 donors i.e. UNHCR, EU and&#13;
bilateral agencies had already: (i) pledged in the Federation approximately US$95 million with&#13;
36 municipalities and in certain instances targeted the beneficiaries; (ii) pledged in Republika&#13;
Srpska approximately US$6 million with five municipalities;  and (iii)appointed  15&#13;
implementing agencies.   The donors and their implementing agencies are operating&#13;
independently of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Environment (MPE), but being&#13;
coordinated by a Housing Task Force chaired by a representative of the EU supported&#13;
International Management Group (IMG). Initially providing construction materials and fostering&#13;
"self-help," many programs now cover the provision of labor as well as materials, everything&#13;
being on a grant basis. All programs are directed at the private sector.&#13;
17.   The speed, extent and level of donor involvement in the repair of private housing reflects:&#13;
(a) an awareness of the shortfall in usable housing;&#13;
(b) the urgency of an immediate response on grant or highly concessional terms; and&#13;
(c) a desire to assist in the repatriation of refugees;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
18.   The decision by the donors to proceed quickly with the repair of private sector housing,&#13;
with grant financing is justified on the grounds of (i) expediency; (ii) the need to move quickly;&#13;
and (iii) priority; which can be given to widowed families, invalid ex-members of the armed&#13;
forces, and the poor and the displaced. The private sector housing repairs, to be financed by the&#13;
Dutch Trust Fund (DTF), and incorporated in the proposed pilot project incorporates the&#13;
principles of (i) and (iii) above.&#13;
19.   Despite the foregoing, there is need to gradually introduce the concept of repayment, and&#13;
the project seeks to do this for public sector housing through charges to recover the cost of&#13;
repairs.  Public Sector housing, which is often referred to as "social" housing, does not&#13;
necessarily house the economically weaker members of society.&#13;
B.   BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
WORLD BANK STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
20.   On April 1, 1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) fulfilled the conditions of succession to&#13;
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.&#13;
Membership is retroactive to February 25, 1993.&#13;
21.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-&#13;
funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the Bank, IMF, EU and EBRD in late&#13;
1995 resulted in the proposed Priority Reconstruction Program which was first presented to a&#13;
donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels, a week after the signing of&#13;
the Paris/Dayton Peace Agreement. This meeting led to donor commitments of about US$600&#13;
million for immediate reconstruction activities. A second donors' conference, again co-chaired&#13;
by the Bank and the EU, was held in mid-April, 1996 and resulted in additional donor pledges on&#13;
the order of US$1.2 billion for financing priority reconstruction activities during 1996.&#13;
22.   The Bank has been following a two-track assistance strategy, which seeks to leverage its&#13;
limited resources with significant resource transfer from donors. First, before arrears resolution,&#13;
the Bank supported selected immediate assistance programs through a special Trust Fund for&#13;
Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH) which is providing US$125 million on&#13;
concessional terms equivalent to those offered by IDA, as well as an additional US$25 million in&#13;
grant funds. Seven emergency operations, committing the entire US$150 million, have been&#13;
approved under the TFBH: an Emergency Recovery Project; a Water, Sanitation, and Solid&#13;
Waste Urgent Works Project; an Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project; an Emergency&#13;
Transport Project; an Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project; an Emergency&#13;
Education Reconstruction Project and a War Victims Rehabilitation Project. Second, following&#13;
arrears resolution (which was made possible by the effectiveness of the Consolidation Loan&#13;
package on June 14, 1996), while the Bank will continue to focus on supporting the&#13;
implementation of the reconstruction program, its assistance program will be broadened to&#13;
include support for the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional&#13;
reforms. In the area of reconstruction, Bank assistance will focus on employment generation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

housing, both needed to facilitate the reintegration of demobilized soldiers and the return of&#13;
refugees, as well as on continued support for the rehabilitation of infrastructure and clearance of&#13;
landmines.&#13;
C. THE PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
23.   The principal objective of the proposed project is to assist the government of Bosnia-&#13;
Herzegovina to:&#13;
(a) carry out urgent housing repairs to both publicly and privately owned housing; and&#13;
(b) contribute to the development of a framework to sustain the recovery and&#13;
development of the housing sector through gradual introduction of cost recovery for&#13;
repair works.&#13;
24.   The more specific objectives would:&#13;
(a) assist in the restoration of the common areas and the weatherproofing of the fabric of&#13;
public sector housing in order to avoid further deterioration;&#13;
(b) carry out a pilot project in four towns which would test the Government's&#13;
approach concerning the repair of housing in both the public and private sectors; and&#13;
(c) strengthen implementing agencies' institutional capacities.&#13;
25.   The proposed project is small when viewed in the context of the needs of the Sector, but&#13;
it is driven by an overriding need to move quickly. The project reflects this. The pilot project,&#13;
financed from the DTF, commenced in the second week of May and US$2 million from DTF&#13;
was reallocated to the project from slowly disbursing projects and a US$2 million Project&#13;
Advance (from IDA) is currently being processed, the aim being to undertake as much work as&#13;
possible during the current construction season.&#13;
26.   Several donors (EU, UNHCR, and USAID) as well as European bilaterals have pledged&#13;
more than US$100 million for urgent private housing repair. EU has indicated its interest in&#13;
taking a lead role supporting the development of an appropriate policy framework. The Projects'&#13;
limited focus on public housing repair is intended to complement the work of other donors.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
27.   To meet these objectives the project incorporates:&#13;
(i) a Pilot Project funded from the Dutch Trust Fund (DTF) targeted at both private and&#13;
public housing;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 7 of 18&#13;
(ii) Emergency Public Housing Repair for the common elements of public housing; and&#13;
(iii)Institutional Support Technical Assistance and Incremental Operating Support for the&#13;
PIU and project municipalities' HMME's design, management and supervision costs.&#13;
28.   Part A - Pilot Project. The pilot project would test the Government's project approach&#13;
and implementing procedures for repairs to private and public housing. Accordingly, it is&#13;
targeted at:&#13;
(i) Privately owned houses in Gornji Vakuf, Vitez and Olovo: In this case, emergency&#13;
repairs would be carried out up to a maximum of US$5,000 per unit with&#13;
specifications to bring them up to a minimum habitable standard (a water tight&#13;
habitable part of dwelling with operating sanitary, heating and electrical systems).&#13;
Eligible beneficiaries would be owners who are either occupying or returning to&#13;
occupy their units and thereby removing their names from the list of displaced&#13;
persons and are registered with the Settlement Fund,&#13;
(ii) Public housing in Sarajevo: Repairs to the damaged common elements of 10&#13;
buildings incorporating approximately 150 apartments at an average cost of US$2,000&#13;
per apartment.&#13;
29.   Under the Pilot Project, a PIU has been formed which would continue to implement the&#13;
larger emergency repair project. Dutch Trust Fund resources are being used to fund PIU staff,&#13;
vehicles and equipment during the four months implementation period and the cost of vehicles&#13;
and equipment. The German Government is also providing resources for the duration of the&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
30.   Part B - Emergency Public Housing Repair. Approximately 190,000 housing units in&#13;
the Federation are regarded as public property or 'public sector housing'. Over half the housing&#13;
stock in the larger cities is in the public sector; in Sarajevo the number of public housing sector&#13;
units approaches 80,000 (approximately 56 percent), and of these, over 48,600 have been&#13;
damaged with 2,748 completely destroyed. The Emergency Repair Program for Public Housing&#13;
would finance the repairs to the roofs, external walls, entrances, staircases and damaged utilities&#13;
etc. in multi-story traditionally built publicly owned housing in Sarajevo, Mostar, Kupres, Olovo,&#13;
and Gorazde selected according to criteria outlined in Appendix 4. It is estimated that the costs&#13;
would amount to US$2,000-US$2,500 per apartment for lightly damaged and structurally sound&#13;
buildings. The program would make the buildings weatherproof and facilitate follow up&#13;
programs concerned with repairs to individual apartments.  It would also arrest further&#13;
deterioration caused by inclement weather and because of this, the program should aim to be&#13;
substantially complete before the onset of winter.&#13;
31.   An additional advantage is in respect of the housing privatization program. Tenants in&#13;
weather proofed buildings are more likely to be persuaded to buy their units even if they are&#13;

damage will be available.&#13;
32.   Part C - Institutional Support and Technical Assistance. Institutional support to the&#13;
PIU that has been established at the MPE will be required in the fonn of vehicles, office&#13;
equipment and operational expenses. It will also be necessary for the PIU and the selected&#13;
Municipalities to hire either Housing Maintenance and Management Enterprise (HMMEs) or&#13;
local consultants to assist with damage assessment, contract administration and supervision.&#13;
Approximately US$1.8 million would be required, to support a US$15 million project, of which&#13;
US$0.50 million has been secured from DTF, and US$0.7 million from GTZ, and US$0.6&#13;
million will come from IDA for HMME design management and supervision costs.&#13;
33.   Project Cost and Financing Plan. The total budgeted cost of the project excluding&#13;
customs costs and taxes equals US$50 million equivalent. No physical or price contingencies&#13;
have been included given the modular nature of the project which can be modified to meet the&#13;
funds available. Project costs are given in Table 1.&#13;

34.   Financing Plan. The financing plan for the project is in Table 2 below. Of the total&#13;
project cost, IDA will finance US$15 million. Donor funds have been secured from the DTF&#13;
(US$3.5 million) and GTZ (US$0.7 million). BH intends to seek US$30.8 million of donor&#13;
support for the repair program. The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be the borrower of the&#13;
IDA Credit. It will make funds available to the Federation through an onlending agreement. The&#13;
Federation will make funds available to the Ministry of Physical Planning and Environment&#13;
The Government has a number of discounting concessions under consideration in its housing privatization&#13;
program; i.e. age (1% per annum); number of years the tenant has made an obligatory contribution to the&#13;
Housing Fund (1% per annum); and 20% discount for cash.&#13;

35.   Flow of Funds. BH is the borrower of the IDA credit. Under the terms of the Subsidiary&#13;
Finance Agreement between the State and the Federation, finds will be lent to the Federation.&#13;
During negotiations agreement was reached that the PIU would directly withdraw funds from the&#13;
Special Account for eligible expenditures under the Project.  The PIU  will have an&#13;
implementation agreement with Housing Maintenance/Management Enterprises (HMME) in&#13;
each project municipality.  HMMEs will be responsible for identifying  damaged buildings&#13;
eligible for loans under the project, prepare damage assessments and bidding documents, assist in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 10 of 18&#13;
tender evaluation and supervise contractors. HMMEs are also responsible for collecting the&#13;
rents, for allocating the amounts corresponding to the repayments for repairs, and for transferring&#13;
them onto the account designated for the project.&#13;
36.   Customs Duties and Taxes. Proceeds of the IDA Credit cannot be used to finance local&#13;
taxes (such as customs duties, sales tax, income tax, etc.).&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
37.   The benefits of repairing war damaged houses, aiding the process of returning displaced&#13;
persons to their communities, participating in the process of conversion from a war torn to a&#13;
peaceful nation are obvious and fully justify the project. However, economic benefits can clearly&#13;
be expected from the completion of the repairs.&#13;
38.   The project is designed to repair the building fabric for approximately 20,000 units in a&#13;
number of municipalities.. Unless repairs are effected, a rapid and major deterioration of the&#13;
buildings can be expected, dramatically affecting the already precarious quality of available&#13;
housing. Therefore, for the targeted units which are likely to include widowed families, invalid&#13;
ex-members of the armed forces, the poor and the displaced, the rapid provision of habitable&#13;
units is of high priority. If nothing is done the lightly damaged buildings will, within three years,&#13;
require major reconstruction. The increase in the supply of habitable units will not only save&#13;
major assets but also contribute to the regeneration of communities as displaced people find a&#13;
place to live and resume their economic activities.&#13;
39.   Given the proposed investment of US$50.0 million for direct construction over the whole&#13;
program, about US$14.0 million of labor income will be generated. Great attention has been paid&#13;
to use Bosnia and Herzegovina building resources and to allow the participation of small local&#13;
contractors to the bidding process. The project will create about 35,000 person-months of&#13;
temporary construction jobs over the implementation period. The generation of labor will have a&#13;
very beneficial impact on the local economy, raising the average standard of living and&#13;
revitalizing the resumption of the construction sector which used to employ 80,000 private and&#13;
public workers in 1991 in 500 enterprises.&#13;
40.   Major public benefits can also be expected from the project, including the following:&#13;
*  strengthening the capacity of a newly formed government to respond rapidly to&#13;
priority needs of its citizens;&#13;
. participating in the process of restoring dysfunctional communities to prewar&#13;
normality;&#13;
* providing employment in the construction industry and fomenting the recovery of&#13;
building suppliers and the building materials industry; and&#13;
* possibly facilitating the privatization program in housing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 11 of 18&#13;
COST RECOVERY&#13;
41.   Given the emergency nature of this project and the strapped financial circumstances of&#13;
both households and local institutions, concessionary financing is justifiable. The estimated&#13;
costs to repair the common parts of buildings in Sarajevo averages at approximately US$2,000&#13;
per apartment. Costs should be recovered over a long period of time reflected in gradually rising&#13;
rents. As a guide to establishing the basis for calculating the incremental rent, the following&#13;
formula has been proposed: a US$2,000, 30 year loan with a five years grace period and interest&#13;
rates of 1.75 percent per annum would-equal monthly payments of US$8.24 or 8.24 percent of&#13;
average household income of US$100 per month. During the grace period, households would be&#13;
required to make only the interest payments of US$2.92, 2.92 percent of the average family&#13;
income.  It is understood that payments in this range will not present any difficulty and firm&#13;
proposals will be available at negotiations.  The PIU will seek arrangements with each&#13;
municipality to allow increases in rents that recover the cost of repairs along the formula&#13;
described here. These funds would revert to the account designated by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
42.   Risks. While there will be major benefits derived from the program, there will be major&#13;
risks to be countered during implementation. The resumption of hostilities is an important risk.&#13;
Other risks concern:&#13;
a) the failure to substantially complete the roof repairs prior to the onset of the 1996/97&#13;
winter; every effort, however, is being made to speed up project processing and&#13;
implementation;&#13;
b) unsatisfactory workmanship on the part of contractors and diversion of resources into&#13;
other activities. This can be overcome by: i) good supervision on the part of the&#13;
HMMEs; ii) random checks and effective technical and financial monitoring by the&#13;
PIU with the help of expatriate technical advisors; iii) supervision and monitoring by&#13;
the housing advisor in the Resident Mission; iv) prior review and approval of the&#13;
pipeline of eligible projects and/or initial procurement actions; and v) self-policing by&#13;
beneficiaries and building occupants; and&#13;
c) possible bottlenecks in project cash flow through the PIU's access to IDA Special&#13;
Account being impeded by bureaucratic procedures.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
43.   The project would have positive environmental impacts as a result of rehabilitating&#13;
displaced people into areas where municipal infrastructure facilities had already been (or are in&#13;
the process of being) repaired and implemented; and where otherwise buildings would stand&#13;
empty to deteriorate through vandalism or weathering. The project has been placed in&#13;
environmental category "C".&#13;

D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
44.   The Ministry of Physical Planning and Environment(MPE) at the Federation level would&#13;
have overall responsibility for project implementation. To ensure timely and efficient project&#13;
implementation, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been established at the MPE and a&#13;
Director has been appointed. Staffing of the PIU will draw on locally-hired contract staff. It is&#13;
being assisted by IMG for the four months duration of the pilot project.&#13;
45.   The staffing and deployment of the unit will be as shown in the organization chart in&#13;
Appendix 2 and will comprise locally and where necessary internationally recruited staff.&#13;
Staffing of the PIU will comprise a core management section which will supervise the staff of the&#13;
HMMEs, the latter reinforced by locally employed engineers and architects. The PIU will have&#13;
the following locally recruited staff: director, financial controller, secretary interpreter; accounts&#13;
database technician, and technical manager. The core PIU team will be assisted as necessary by&#13;
foreign advisors experienced in construction, project, technical and financial management who&#13;
will advise on project management, financial controls, monitoring of the program and setting up&#13;
of appropriate financial control systems. (Appendix 3 provides descriptions of the PIU staff&#13;
roles).&#13;
46.   The PIU will have prime responsibility for:&#13;
*  establishing criteria for physical repair;&#13;
*  defining project approval, contract performance specifications, disbursement and&#13;
control procedures and necessary forms;&#13;
*  maintaining information on housing damage, repair programs and unit costs;&#13;
*  monitoring and supervision of emergency housing repair programs;&#13;
*  managing disbursement and procurement of goods and services required for the&#13;
project;&#13;
*  maintaining project accounts and records;&#13;
*  coordinating information on project procedures and implementation at the local and&#13;
regional levels and with donors; and&#13;
*  preparing request for disbursements and statements of expenditures.&#13;
47.   Local Project Teams will be established wherever possible within each HMME and will&#13;
be responsible for the day to day implementation of the local programs. These offices will be&#13;
staffed either by existing HMME employees allocated for the project or by recruited contract&#13;
staff. A World Bank mission in May visited Sarajevostan (the Hlousing Managemernt Con .- nm:.&#13;
in Sarajevo) and the Reconstruction Offices in East and West Mostar. All three were found to be&#13;
capable and competent and the EU is providing technical assistance to the agencies in Mostar.&#13;
The PIU will assess the competence and capacity of other municipalities and their agencies.&#13;
Recommendations will be made as appropriate. The local offices will be responsible for selecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 13 of 18&#13;
buildings to be repaired according to pre-determined criteria, undertaking damage assessments,&#13;
organizing with the PIU the issue and receipt of competitive bids, inspection of the contractor's&#13;
work and maintaining local project accounts.&#13;
48.   Details of specific responsibilities of the PIU are given in Appendix 2.&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
49.   Part A - The Pilot Project. Implementation of the pilot project will be with the&#13;
assistance of IMG which is well established in BH and has detailed knowledge of the housing&#13;
situation. The setting up of the PIU, the purchase of necessary equipment and the recruitment of&#13;
local project staff have already started using the Dutch Trust Fund resources. Criteria for the&#13;
selection of municipalities for the pilot project were established during the Bank Mission to&#13;
Sarajevo in March and were applied to the selection of the first three towns to receive support&#13;
under the project. The City of Sarajevo was added to the list during the Bank Mission in May&#13;
1996. A public notice inviting contractors to apply for pre-qualification has been published by&#13;
the MPE and suitable applicants have been issued with tender documentation.&#13;
(a) Private Sector Housing. As stated in para. 47 each municipality will be required to&#13;
set up a local project office from which repairs to housing will be assessed, repair&#13;
contract documentation collated and issued to tenderers, tenders received and&#13;
contracts approved. The local project teams have carried out the damage assessments&#13;
on properties selected according to established criteria. A five percent audit sample&#13;
would be undertaken by the PIU to determine the acceptability of the assessments.&#13;
These assessments will form bills of quantities accompanying the contract&#13;
documentation (instructions, conditions and specifications) to be issued to tenderers.&#13;
The local office will receive tenders and will review them with the PIU. Contractors&#13;
would be allowed to bid on a package of eligible units for a minimum of US$50,000&#13;
and a maximum value according to the stated capacity of contractors. Price quotations&#13;
would be submitted for each unit in the package. Once bids are evaluated in Olovo,&#13;
Vitez and Gomji Vakuf, beneficiaries would then be allowed to enter into contracts&#13;
based on the lowest evaluated bid for their unit. In all cases, the beneficiary would be&#13;
issued a certificate approving the contract amount and specifications. The&#13;
municipality will sign a performance contract with each contractor and will facilitate&#13;
the signing of individual contracts between each property owner and the contractor.&#13;
(b) Public Sector Housing, City of Sarajevo. Sarajevostan, with approximately 80,000&#13;
housing units in its portfolio, has already chosen 10 buildings incorporating&#13;
approximately 150 units, and let contracts for the repair of a single building or&#13;
number of buildings as appropriate.&#13;
50.   During the period of contract works, which are expected to be completed within four&#13;
months, Sarajevostan will certify payments to be made from DTF and will supervise the quality&#13;
and progress of the works. The municipalities, and Sarajevostan will also maintain proper project&#13;
accounts which will be reported to the PIU on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
- Page 14of18&#13;
51.   Contractors will be responsible for the procurement and provision of all necessary&#13;
materials and labor to fulfill the works. Emphasis under the contracts will be on local&#13;
procurement wherever possible. A period of six months for defects maintenance will apply.&#13;
52.   Part B - The Emergency Public Housing Repair. The procedures for implementing the&#13;
emergency program of repairs to public sector housing will be the same as those described in&#13;
45(b)-47. The PIU will continue to monitor, supervise and advise on all aspects of the work. The&#13;
emergency program commenced in May 1996 and will continue for six to fifteen months of&#13;
construction followed by a six-month defect maintenance period. As the PIU-managed program&#13;
expands it will be necessary to provide further technical support both at the local level for the&#13;
assessment of damaged property and the management of local teams.&#13;
53.   The implementation schedule of the program is as given in Appendix 1.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
54.   The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3 below and are in line&#13;
with the agreed procedures for "Reconstruction of Bosnia Herzegovina-Procurement under&#13;
Emergency Projects," as issued by the Bosnia Ad-hoc Advisory Committee on January 4, 1996.&#13;
The proposed project procurement plan is attached in Appendix 11. In case of parallel financing&#13;
(such as funding by the EU, EC, or bilateral donors), the applicable procurement procedures of&#13;
the respective donors would be applied. Goods, Works, Consultant Services and incremental&#13;
operating costs financed by the DTF are to follow applicable procurement procedures outlined in&#13;
the Grant Agreement No. TF 020274. To respond in a timely fashion to the post-war emergency&#13;
situation in BH, the procurement methods described below would be used for IDA-financed&#13;
procurement.&#13;
55.   Procurement of Small Works Contracts for works shall be grouped in bid packages&#13;
estimated to cost US$30,000 equivalent or more each. The works will be procured under lump-&#13;
sum, fixed price (with 5% variation allowance) contracts awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtained from three qualified contractors (qualified according to criteria acceptable to IDA) in&#13;
response to written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the work,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion date, and relevant drawings where&#13;
applicable and be in a form that is acceptable to IDA The works contracts would vary in value&#13;
between approximately US$30,000 and under US$1 million. The contracts would be between&#13;
the HMMEs and the successful bidder. Bid Evaluations will be undertaken by the PIU and the&#13;
HMME on a building by building basis with the award going to the lowest bidder who has the&#13;
experience and resources to complete the contract successfully. Prior to the issuance of any&#13;
invitations soliciting quotations a procurement plan for the Project shall be furnished to IDA for&#13;
its review and approval.&#13;
56.   Other. This category includes design, management and supervision expenses of&#13;
HMMEs, estimated at 4% of the works contracts.&#13;
57.   Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents.   Bidding documents&#13;
prepared by the World Bank for use for procurement of small works (under the agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
Procurement under Emergency Projects referred to in paragraph 51) would be used. The first&#13;
five works contracts to be funded through IDA would require prior review by IDA. Post reviews&#13;
of procurement actions would be carried out on a quarterly basis by IDA supervision missions.&#13;

DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
58.   The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Tables 4 and 5 below.&#13;
Disbursements are expected to be completed within a period of two years from the date of&#13;
effectiveness. The IDA credit would finance the categories shown in Table 6, works and&#13;
incremental operating costs in the form of design, management and supervision fees of HMMEs.&#13;
56.   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be opened and&#13;
maintained in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, on behalf of the State Ministry of Finance.&#13;
The State would make these funds available to the Federation Ministry of Finance under the&#13;
terms of the Subsidiary Finance Agreement between the State and the Federation. The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Special Account would be limited to US$3 million or four months average&#13;
estimated share of expenditures. The PIU Director would be authorized to directly sign for&#13;
disbursements from the Special Account. The PIU would in turn make resources available to&#13;
participating municipalities. See Appendix 8 for proposed detailed flow of funds.&#13;

Page 17 of 18&#13;
documents evidencing expenditures will be reviewed and retained by the PIU and made available&#13;
for the required audit as well as the Bank supervision missions.&#13;
ACCOUNTS, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
58.   Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established at the PIU, created by&#13;
the MPE. These accounts would include:&#13;
*  a record of withdrawals on the Special Account with copies of underlying&#13;
documentation of all disbursements;&#13;
*  accounting records that indicate how much has been spent in each municipality; and&#13;
bank statements on the Special Account;&#13;
*  adequate subsidiary records that show  total expenditures for each beneficiary&#13;
household/unit contracts for private housing and payments to contractors; and&#13;
*  a record of transactions on the Special Account and the copies of bank statements on&#13;
this account.&#13;
59.   Technical assistance to the MPE is included under the project to establish proper accounts&#13;
and financial control procedures.&#13;
60.   Audits. The project accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors under&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The terms of reference would include audits for the&#13;
Special Account, and the Statements of Expenditures. All audit reports will be sent to the Bank&#13;
no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year. The MPE will maintain project&#13;
accounts for one year after the project closes.&#13;
61.   Reporting. The MPE will prepare and furnish to the Bank, in English, a quarterly&#13;
progress report showing the status of implementation, the status of procurement and a financial&#13;
report in a format acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
62.   Project implementation would incorporate a large degree of flexibility in view of the fact&#13;
that it would need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Given the need for expedited&#13;
implementation, the project would be supervised every three months after effectiveness.&#13;
Implementation progress would be evaluated six months after effectiveness. The review would&#13;
assess the need for any adjustments. based on implementation experience to date. During the&#13;
period of implementation of the pilot project (April-August 1996) experience will be gained with&#13;
the implementation procedures and adjustments made accordingly. Starting in June 1996 for a&#13;
period of six months, a Housing Director operating out of the Resident Mission in Sarajevo&#13;
would continuously supervise all initial project implementation steps, and would assist closely&#13;
on matters requiring advice and rapid decisions.&#13;

DETAILED FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
1.    BH is the borrower of the IDA credit. Under the terms of the Subsidiary Agreement&#13;
between BH and the Federation, funds will be transferred to the Federation. The PIU will be&#13;
authorized to withdraw funds from the Special Account for eligible expenditures under the&#13;
Project. PIU will have an implementation agreement with Housing Maintenance/Management&#13;
Enterprises (HMME) in each project municipality. HMME's will be responsible for identifying&#13;
damaged buildings eligible for loans under the project, prepare damage assessments and bidding&#13;
documents, evaluate tenders and supervise contractors. HMME's are also responsible for&#13;
collecting the rents, for allocating the amounts corresponding to the loan payments for repairs,&#13;
and for transferring them onto the account designated by the FMoF for the project.&#13;
PROJECT FLOW OF FUNDS FOR ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES&#13;
2.    The project flow of funds comprises the following steps:&#13;
(i) A US dollar Special Account will be established at a commercial bank on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA on behalf of the State with an Authorized Allocation&#13;
of US$3 million.&#13;
(ii) BH will authorize the use of these funds by the Federation under the terms of the&#13;
Subsidiary Finance Agreement between BH and the Federation.&#13;
(iii) The Federation will authorize PIU to withdraw funds from the Special Account for&#13;
eligible expenditures under the Project.&#13;
(iv) PIU, subject to adequate controls and according to agreed procedures, will pay&#13;
contractors, for eligible expenditures approved by HMME's.&#13;
3.    The PIU will prepare an Application for Withdrawl-Form 1903 (the Bank's authorized&#13;
format), using a Statement of Expenditure (SOE) for all incremental operating costs and contracs&#13;
below $1 million, together with a Special Account bank statement and reconcilliation of this&#13;
Account, to IDA for replenishment.&#13;
4.    The above 5 steps describe the procedures that apply to the IDA project. Other parallel&#13;
financing donor projects might require other procedures, but the PIU, BH and the Federation&#13;
must not commingle IDA financed funds with those of other donors.&#13;

APPENDIX 9&#13;
AVAILABILITY OF LABOR AND BUILDING MATERIALS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.    An integral part of the activities of the World Bank Mission to Sarajevo in March was to&#13;
review the availability of suitable labor and building materials to complete the proposed&#13;
emergency house repair program. Two main considerations were identified: that labor and&#13;
materials, both preferably from local sources, were available, and that any significant increase in&#13;
the demand for materials would not result in overheating the local economy.&#13;
Labor&#13;
2.    The labor needed to carry out the repairs program financed by IDA and DTF (US$18&#13;
million) is not expected to cause any significant problems.&#13;
3.   Inquiries made at the EU mission office in Sarajevo suggest that there are some 400&#13;
contractors with a staff of 50 or more still in existence in BH. Discussion with Sarajevestan (the&#13;
public housing management organization in Sarajevo) confirms that in the city of Sarajevo at&#13;
least there is a large pool of building workers such that labor shortages will not be a problem. A&#13;
similar situation appears to exist in other towns and municipalities. There is a pent up desire to&#13;
start the repair work.&#13;
Materials&#13;
4.    Before the war, the former Yugoslavia was pre-eminent in international contracting and&#13;
also maintained a strong national construction program. Many building materials were obtained&#13;
nationally although supplies of some items, such as glass, for example, were supplemented by&#13;
importation. The war has resulted in a virtual cessation of materials production in BH but there&#13;
are now positive signs of regeneration of supplies.&#13;
5.    The capacity of the local building materials industry is of vital importance for the&#13;
rehabilitation process, especially for large scale reconstruction programs. Materials can be&#13;
imported by donors, as is the case presently, but the local economy will not benefit unless it&#13;
regains some production and marketing capacity. Using locally produced materials would also&#13;
reduce the strain on transport to bring in the material, and the load on the major roads&#13;
themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 9&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
6.     The basic requirements for materials to effect building repairs are cement, aggregates,&#13;
clay products (blocks, roof tiles etc.), timbers, glass, sanitary and plumbing items, electrical&#13;
wiring and fittings and decorative paints. Of this list all sanitary, plumbing, electrical and&#13;
metalwork (ironmongery) items, have been and will continue to be imported. It is also probable&#13;
that, in the short term at least, so too will external doors.&#13;
7.     The remaining items are available from sources in BH and Croatia although not in large&#13;
quantities at present. The reconstruction program will necessarily result in the re-establishment&#13;
of certain manufacturing capabilities to meet the program and the situation will improve with&#13;
time. Also with the implementation of the mine clearance program mineral quarries currently&#13;
unable to function will come back into production thus enhancing the local availability of&#13;
building materials. A major limestone quarry south west of Sarajevo is currently unable to&#13;
operate because of the land mining that has occurred and it will be critical to the building&#13;
program that such facilities are restored to production at the earliest opportunity.&#13;
8.     Roof tiles are manufactured in Tuzla and Kakanj and, under a Swedish aid program, there&#13;
are plans to further increase production facilities in Sarajevo. The same is true of cement&#13;
production. A window manufacturing plant is established in Ilija, Sarajevo, and it is understood&#13;
that this plant will return to production within the next few weeks.&#13;
9.     A survey of building materials in central BH was carried out in 1995 by Hifab&#13;
International AB. Their report concludes that production facilities are available in the country&#13;
although many are non-operational at present. The following summarizes their findings:&#13;
Product                                           Operational&#13;
Limestone, concrete building materials ..........................   Partly&#13;
Cement ..........................                          No&#13;
Prefabricated building elements ........... ............... Partly&#13;
Insulated wall units ..........................           Yes&#13;
Clay bricks ..........................                     No&#13;
Stoves, water heaters ..........................           No&#13;
Fiber board ..........................                     No&#13;
Plywood, timbers, windows and doors ..........................  Partly&#13;
Kitchen fittings and furniture .........  ................. Partly&#13;
Plastic pipes for water and sewerage .......................... Partly&#13;
10.   When contractors were questioned about the availability of building materials they&#13;
claimed everything was available although imported materials will take time to deliver.&#13;
However, it is of importance that links with overseas suppliers appear still to exist and can be&#13;
activated as required.&#13;

PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES&#13;
Mechanism for Procurement under Small Works&#13;
I .    To assure consistency as well as to facilitate a competitive environment the following&#13;
procedures are established: Detailed damage assessment of apartment buildings and selected single&#13;
family homes eligible under the Government's emergency repair program will be made by the&#13;
Technical Departments of each municipality or its housing maintenance and management enterprise&#13;
(HMME) according to the standards and procedures established by the PIU. Technical assistance to&#13;
the Municipal Technical Departments or HMME's will be provided by the program.&#13;
Prequalification of the Bidders&#13;
2.    A general prequalification of contractors will be carried out. For this purpose, a notice will&#13;
be published in the press and announcements will be made in each municipality inviting local and&#13;
national contractors to express their interest in prequalification. This information submitted by&#13;
firms will be used to carry out their general prequalification for different levels in terms of contract&#13;
values. The prequalification criteria shall be approved by the Association.&#13;
3.    To prequalify, bidders shall provide prequalification information using standard forms&#13;
provided by the PIU and they shall meet the following minimum qualifying criteria:&#13;
* demonstrated capacity as contractor to successfully complete works in the amount&#13;
equal to the aggregate contract value specified in the bid.&#13;
*  experience as contractor in the construction of similar works of nature and complexity&#13;
to the proposed works over the last 6 years.&#13;
*  proposals for the timely staffing of essential labor force for the completion of the&#13;
works specified in the bid.&#13;
4.    Contractors who are prequalified will be invited to offer their price quotations for any of the&#13;
apartment buildings and housing units included in the package. The bidders will be asked to offer&#13;
their price quotations separately for each building or housing unit selected by them. The aggregate&#13;
contract value, however, cannot be:&#13;
(i) less than US $ 30,000 or more than US$1 million (public sector housing); or&#13;

5.    In the case of public sector housing the contracts will be signed by the municipality (or its&#13;
housing maintenance and management enterprise); in the case of the private sector housing (pilot&#13;
project), each beneficiary will be allowed to contract with contractors who offer the lowest price&#13;
quotation for the required work, and who have the experience and resources to successfully&#13;
complete the contract accordingly.&#13;
Tendering Process&#13;
6.    A schedule of items of works compiled for every property will be issued to each tenderer&#13;
who will submit its prices, fixed for the specified period of time to cover the completion of the&#13;
works.&#13;
7.    Tenderers will be invited to submit their bids for repair contract works up to the upper&#13;
limit of total contract value allowed.&#13;
8.    By assessment of the bids received for each property, contracts will be awarded to the&#13;
lowest evaluated bidder.&#13;

            Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Housing
            Repair Project

        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the
            Emergency Housing Repair Project are to assist the
            government of Bosnia - Herzegovina to carry out urgent
            housing repairs to both publicly and privately owned housing
            and to contribute to the development of a framework to
            sustain the recovery and development of the housing sector
            through gradual introduction of cost recovery for repair
            works. To meet these objectives, the project incorporates:
            a) a pilot project funded from the Dutch Trust Fund targeted
            at both private and public housing; b) emergency public
            housing repair for the common elements of public housing;
            and c) institutional support technical assistance and
            incremental operating support for the Project Implementation
            Unit and project municipalities' Housing Maintenance
            and Managing Enterprise design, management and supervision costs.
