Abstract&#13;
This study provides an empirical analysis of the sources of Turkey's&#13;
growth and structural change since the 1950's, and considers the prospects for&#13;
its transition from and inward-looking development strategy to trade-oriented&#13;
growth in the 1980s.      The paper discusses the major planning issues for&#13;
improved adjustment to current domestic and international economic problems,&#13;
with special attention to the role of Turkey's public and private sectors in&#13;
the industrialization process.    As part of a project on industrialization in&#13;
selected   semi-industrial   countries,  the   study   also  compares   Turkey's&#13;
experience with those of other countries.&#13;

Summary&#13;
This paper analyzes the sources of Turkey's growth and structural&#13;
change since the 1950s, with an emphasis on the limits of an inward-looking&#13;
development strategy for Turkey's industrialization and its adjustment to&#13;
current economic conditions. The analysis suggests that Turkey needs to alter&#13;
its trade orientation and the paper describes the major issues that must be&#13;
faced for a successful transition to a trade-oriented development strategy in&#13;
the 1980s.&#13;
For economic, historic, institutional and policy reasons, Turkey's&#13;
postwar growth strategy has generally been inward-looking.    In comparison to&#13;
other semi-industrial countries of a similar size, Turkey has had a very low&#13;
share of trade in GDP until recently.      As this study emphasizes, internal&#13;
factors and domestic demand have been the main sources of Turkish growth and&#13;
structural change.   The limited role of trade in Turkey's industrialization&#13;
has been due primarily to the relatively large size of its domestic markets,&#13;
its natural resotlrce diversity, political conditions, and the structure of&#13;
incentives.    Unlike other semi-industrial countries that had successfully&#13;
switched from an import substitution to an export-oriented strategy, Turkey&#13;
thus prolonged the inward-oriented phase of its manufacturing growth.      As a&#13;
result, a highly protected industrial structure that relied heavily on the&#13;
import   of   intermediate  goods   became   a   costly  feature   of   Turkish&#13;
industrialization.   However, with the external economic shocks of the 1970s,&#13;
it became clear that Turkey's narrow trade focus could not be sustained.&#13;
These new developments in the world economic scene added to already serious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
adjustment problems resulting from increased import intensity and stagnant&#13;
export growth.&#13;
This paper also analyzes the sources of changes in factor uses and&#13;
relative prices and the implications of these results for policy planners.&#13;
Despite the growth of the manufacturing sector, Turkey's structural transition&#13;
has not been accompanied by sufficient increases in employment, and employment&#13;
problems will continue to be a major item on the policy agenda.       Increased&#13;
trade-oriented growth, with a gradual decline in the levels of protection for&#13;
domestic market-oriented industries, will generate important shifts in&#13;
sectoral prices, real wages and profits.&#13;
Finally, for planners, the study indicates several problems that&#13;
could be remedied through policy measures. The lack of integrative mechanisms&#13;
and common rules of market behavior in Turkey's dualistic mixed economy system&#13;
has led to pervasive distortions in the structure of savings, costs and&#13;
prices.    In addition,   the reliance   on non-price measures   and  selective&#13;
policies rather than general policy instruments to achieve economy-wide&#13;
objectives has created difficulties for the consistency and efficiency of&#13;
savings generation and resource allocation, and has led to recurrent balance&#13;
of payments problems.    The concluding part of the paper reviews the major&#13;
directions of policy changes required for a more viable growth process in the&#13;
l980s.&#13;

SOURCES OF INDUSTRIAL GROWTH&#13;
AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE:&#13;
The Case of Turkey&#13;
Merih Celasun&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Turkey's delayed adjustment to the external economic shocks of the&#13;
mid-1970s has resulted in costly growth losses, hyperinflation and political&#13;
instability.    At  the heart   of  the adjustment   difficulties were    certain&#13;
structural trends that minimized the role of trade in the development&#13;
process. Institutional features and policy also played important roles. This&#13;
study examines the various factors that have shaped Turkey's economy since&#13;
1950, with an emphasis on the implications of an inward-looking trade&#13;
strategy. A major objective of the historical analysis is to delineate the&#13;
scope of the major planning issues involved in the transition toward trade-&#13;
oriented growth in the 1980s.&#13;
This paper is part of a comparative study of industrialization in&#13;
selected   semi-industrial   countries 1/     The  broad   objectives  of   these&#13;
coordinated research efforts are to determine the common features of&#13;
industrialization, and to explain country differences in terms of specific&#13;
policies and resource endowments. Technical economic analysis is an important&#13;
part of the project.    Varied input-output methods, which are used to analyze&#13;
the changing combinations of factors in growth under different conditions,&#13;
have been applied to each country.&#13;
The analysis of Turkey primarily concerns the estimation of the&#13;
1/ Chenery (1979, Chapter 3) presents an overview of the typical patterns and&#13;
sources of industrialization at various stages of the development process.&#13;
Kubo and Robinson (1979) give the initial results of the comparative&#13;
analysis of the sources of industrial growth in eight countries (including&#13;
Turkey).    The seven others are Japan,     Norway, Korea,   Taiwan,  Mexico,&#13;
Colombia and Israel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
sources of growth and structural change in production and imports in 1953-73&#13;
(Chapter 3).   The sources of change in value added, factor use and relative&#13;
product prices from 1963-73 have also been studied because more detailed&#13;
information is available for that period (Chapter 4). The overall structural&#13;
assessment has been extended to 1978 based on the average country patterns&#13;
estimated by Chenery and Syrquin (1975) and Chenery and Taylor (1968).&#13;
Accordingly, Chapter 5 examines the transformation of the manufacturing sector&#13;
in more detail and discusses the roles of the public and private sectors in&#13;
the growth of individual manufacturing industries.&#13;
Development policy has played a significant role in Turkish growth&#13;
and structural change. During 1953-73, the style and framework of development&#13;
policy changed.   The first decade was an era of uncoordinated development,&#13;
which was characterized by frequent shifts in the government's ad hoc economic&#13;
policies.   In contrast, from 1963-73 formal economy-wide planning techniques&#13;
and institutions were adopted and a stronger emphasis on non-inflationary&#13;
growth and industrialization was apparent. The trade and balance of payments&#13;
regime had essentially a semi-closed character during 1953-70, but became more&#13;
open in the early 1970s. The relatively larger role of export expansion as a&#13;
source of growth from 1968-73 reflected both the effects of switching to a&#13;
semi-open trade regime and the impact of the world commodity boom in 1971-&#13;
73.   The final section    (Chapter 6) provides a brief review of the basic&#13;
institutional and policy factors that have been instrumental in Turkey's&#13;
inward-looking industrialization strategy. It also discusses Turkey's recent&#13;
(1980-81) policy changes and the prospects for a trade-oriented transition in&#13;
the 1980s. Suggestions for future planning and research are offered as well.&#13;
Extensive empirical work on the construction of price indices for&#13;
production, imports and exports that have shown considerable intersectoral and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
intrasectoral variation has been an integral part of the project.       The data&#13;
base largely consists of sectoral output and trade data for 1953 and 1958 and&#13;
official input output tables for 1963, 1968 and 1973.     The sector information&#13;
has been adjusted for consistency and reclassified at the 25 sector level 1/&#13;
A useful by-product of this study is a set of deflated input-output tables,&#13;
which closely conform to the official national accounts published by Turkey's&#13;
State Institute of Statistics (SIS). The analytical methods of the sources of&#13;
growth analysis are reviewed in Appendix 1.      The deflation procedures used,&#13;
sectoral price indices constructed and sector classification adopted in data&#13;
processing are presented in Appendix 2.&#13;
1/ For brevity in presentation, the computer printouts (for decomposition&#13;
measures) at the 25 sector level of aggregation are summarized in the text&#13;
in tables prepared at the 9 sector level of aggregation.&#13;

1. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: 1923-1980&#13;
Although the sources of growth analysis covers 1953-73, further&#13;
historical background on Turkey's economic growth is needed to indicate trends&#13;
over a longer perspective. Chapter 1 presents a survey of the major phases of&#13;
development marked by important institutional and/or policy changes since the&#13;
early days of the Republic. The major economic indicators assembled in Tables&#13;
l.la and 1.lb describe the historical evolution of the economy according to&#13;
its principal structural features from 1923-73. 1/&#13;
A. Economic Development Before 1950&#13;
The Turkish Republic was established in 1923 upon the end of the War&#13;
of Independence that erupted after the Ottoman Empire was dissolved. As shown&#13;
in Table 1.lb, economic growth was very rapid between 1923 and 1938 before it&#13;
was interrupted by World War II.    (The annual increase of per capita GNP was&#13;
5.3 percent.)    The first fifteen years of the new republican period was&#13;
characterized  by  profound  social  reforms.    However,  these  reforms were&#13;
accompanied by only moderate changes in economic organization and productive&#13;
structure.&#13;

A major shift in economic policy took place in the early 1930s&#13;
partly in response to the Depression.     A renewed emphasis was placed on the&#13;
creation   and  expansion   of   government-owned   enterprises  in   industrial&#13;
sectors.    Because  of  the vigorous   initiatives  of public enterprises    in&#13;
commodity-producing sectors, the share of the non-service sectors in GDP&#13;
increased from 60 percent in the mid-1920s to 67 percent in 1938. 1/ However,&#13;
growth and price stability were interrupted by World War II.       As a result,&#13;
average annual GNP growth fell to -2.9 and 1.2 percent in 1938-43 and 1938-48,&#13;
respectively. Following a major exchange rate adjustment in 1946, government&#13;
policies gradually shifted back toward a free enterprise orientation.2/        A&#13;
more decisive shift in that direction occurred after the political changes&#13;
resulting from the 1950 election.3/    Because of shifting political attitudes&#13;
and priorities, a draft five-year plan was not formally adopted in 1947-52.4/&#13;
B. Economic Development in 1950-1973&#13;
Aided by a steep rise in agricultural output (due to favorable&#13;
weather conditions and extension of farmland) and primary exports, the economy&#13;
expanded rapidly at an average annual rate of 7.9 percent from 1948-53.&#13;
However, after the crop failure of 1954, Turkey entered a phase of severe&#13;
balance of payments problems and stagnant growth.      As a result of continual&#13;
difficulties in increasing agricultural output, controlling domestic inflation&#13;

and revitalizing the trade sector, annual growth averaged around 4.0 percent&#13;
during 1953-58.   This led to the introduction of a devaluation and stabili-&#13;
zation policy package in August 1958.1/&#13;
From 1958-63, major factors accompanying Turkey's average growth of&#13;
5.0 percent annually were a military intervention (1960); the gradual&#13;
transition to price stability; the design of a more systematic incentive&#13;
structure; and the institutionalization of formal development planning.     The&#13;
economic difficulties faced in the late 1950s were further aggravated by rapid&#13;
population growth (2.8 percent a year) and an upsurge in rural-urban migration&#13;
at nearly 6.5 percent a year (see Table l.lb). 2/&#13;
There were important differences in the instruments and style of&#13;
development policy between the two consecutive ten-year periods from 1953-&#13;
73.  The 1963-73 period was characterized by the implementation of two five-&#13;
year plans, whereas the earlier period was a time of ad hoc shifts in the&#13;
government's policies, as well as frequent fluctuations in output and trade&#13;
conditions.   Turkey's development planning in the 1960s, which emphasized&#13;
economy-wide as well as balanced growth, was part of the country's response to&#13;
the imbalances experienced and limited resource mobilization achieved in the&#13;
1950s.&#13;
Turkey's economic performance improved in the second ten-year&#13;
period. Despite sluggish growth in agricultural production, annual GNP growth&#13;
for 1963-73 averaged around 6.7 percent, as compared with 4.8 percent in&#13;
1/ The exchange rate was adjusted de facto from 2.8 to 9.0 TL per US dollar&#13;
for numerous transactions.&#13;

1953-63S     The average share of fixed investment in GNP (at market prices)&#13;
increased from about 14.0 percent in 1953-62 to 16.1 percent in 1963-72.&#13;
During the First and Second Plans (1963-67 and 1968-72), emphasis was placed&#13;
on improving domestic savings performance.       This led to marginal savings&#13;
ratios of 32 and 26 percent, respectively.     In turn, the observed ratios of&#13;
current account deficit to GNP (at market prices) were quite low, and they&#13;
averaged around 1.8 and 0.6 percent, respectively, under the two consecutive&#13;
five-year plans.   Public savings were about 45-50 percent of total domestic&#13;
savings.   The proportionally larger share of public fixed investment in the&#13;
total (around 52-53 percent) reflected the significant role assigned to the&#13;
public sector in major development programs.2/&#13;
However, the adoption of formal planning did not significantly&#13;
change the restrictive trade policies which discriminated against exports, and&#13;
relied heavily on import rationing measures.!/ To the contrary, annual import&#13;
programs featuring quantitative restrictions became an important policy device&#13;
under the successive five-year plans.    The structure of protection resulting&#13;
from the trade regime allowed high-cost and import-dependent private&#13;
manufacturing plants to be established and maintained.&#13;
Turkeyos decision to join the European Economic Community (EEC) was&#13;
an important policy development in 1963-73. In September 1963, Turkey and the&#13;
EEC signed the Association Agreement, which stipulated that two stages&#13;
(preparatory and transitional)    would occur before    full membership.    The&#13;

preparatory stage was completed by the end of the 1960s, and the Additional&#13;
Protocol was signed in November 1970.       The latter protocol, which became&#13;
effective in January 1973, specified the ground rules for the transitional&#13;
stage of establishing a customs union with the EEC before the full membership&#13;
stage.&#13;
At the beginning of the transitional stage, the EEC removed tariff&#13;
barriers for Turkish manufactured exports, except for certain products, such&#13;
as cotton yarns and numerous processed food items in which Turkey has a&#13;
considerable  comparative   advantage.    For  agricultural  exports,   the  EEC&#13;
provided selective trade facilities, which were eroded shortly thereafter by&#13;
the EEC's subsequent agreements with other countries.l/        In turn, Turkey&#13;
agreed to remove gradually tariff and non-tariff barriers for EEC manufactured&#13;
imports according to two timetables (over 12 and 22 year periods, as&#13;
differentiated by products), and eventually to realign her tariff structure&#13;
with the EEC's external tariff structure. Until foreign exchange restrictions&#13;
appeared in 1978, tariff reductions were carried out as scheduled in the&#13;
Additional Protocol.    Free movement for Turkish workers, one of the next&#13;
hurdles, is likely to be limited due to growing unemployment in the EEC.&#13;
The cyclical position of the economy in the early 1970s affects the&#13;
analysis because 1973 marks the end of the period studied.        GNP growth in&#13;
1971-73 received a substantial boost from a huge increase in workers'&#13;

remittances following the devaluation of August 1970.1/      The remittances, in&#13;
turn, reflected the rapid expansion of the Western European economies in 1970-&#13;
73. Net factor income from abroad reached an all-time high, 4.6 percent of&#13;
GNP, in 1973.     This sharp rise in the export of factor services was also&#13;
accompanied by a significant increase in agriculture-based exports, largely as&#13;
the  result  of  expanding   world  demand  and  favorable   shifts  in  relative&#13;
prices. The improved foreign exchange position of the country also led to the&#13;
rapid growth of imports of basic intermediate goods, investment goods and&#13;
parts for consumer durables.&#13;
C. Economic Development After 1973&#13;
Despite the oil crisis and related external shocks, Turkey attempted&#13;
to preserve its growth momentum under the Third Plan (1973-77) through rapid&#13;
reserve decumulation and massive external borrowing.     Instead of relying upon&#13;
internal adjustment to promote balance of payments improvement, the various&#13;
coalition governments pursued expansionary policies, while allowing a decline&#13;
in marginal savings ratios, and negative import substitution in the energy and&#13;
manufacturing sectors.!/ The average rate of GNP growth was about 6.5 percent&#13;
a year (despite a 4 percent growth in 1977), and the investment/GNP ratio&#13;
increased from 18 percent in 1973 to 23.5 percent in 1977.           The marginal&#13;

dollar for a wide range of transactions, excluding certain agricultural&#13;
exports.&#13;
2/ In Balassa (1979 and 1981), Turkey's adjustment policies (after 1973) are&#13;
reviewed in the light of the experience of other industrializing eco-&#13;
nomics. Celasun (1980 a) provides an appraisal of the real and monetary&#13;
aspects, while Dervis and Robinson (1978) analyze the erosion of the real&#13;
foreign exchange rate in the 1973-77 period.       In World Bank (1980), the&#13;
salient features of the 1978 and 1979 Stabilization Programs are dis-&#13;
cussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
savings ratio for the five-year period averaged around 12 percent, while the&#13;
current account deficit as a proportion of GNP rose sharply and reached&#13;
unsustainable proportions in 1976 and 1977 (around 5.7 and 8.0 percent,&#13;
respectively).   The heavy borrowing soon led to a high external debt ($14&#13;
billion by the end of 1978, including $7.5 billion in short-term debt).&#13;
In addition to the adverse impact of the sharp rise in imported oil&#13;
prices, the implementation of the Third Plan involved major difficulties in&#13;
coping with the increasing import intensity of intermediate inputs in the&#13;
production structure.   By the early 1970s, the Turkish economy had developed&#13;
to the intermediate stage of import substitution, which had the following&#13;
characteristics: (1) the exhaustion of easy import substitution possibilities&#13;
in the early industries; (2) the pronounced shifts in the structure of&#13;
intermediate inputs towards more technology-intensive and capital-intensive&#13;
materials; and (3) the need for increased selectivity in the choice of trade-&#13;
improving investment programs.1/     Despite the large increase in levels of&#13;
fixed investment, net import substitution was negative and hurt the balance of&#13;
payments in 1973-77. Turkey's export market shares also decreased noticeably&#13;
in this period 2/&#13;
Because it could not sustain heavy external borrowing as the main&#13;
adjustment mechanism, the Turkish economy finally faced a severe crisis in&#13;
1978-80. The juncture of structural, cyclical and political difficulties of&#13;
unprecedented proportions worsened matters.     The measures contained in two&#13;
stabilization programs in 1978 and 1979 proved to be inadequate in reducing&#13;

distortions of resource allocation and curbing domestic inflation.1/ Annual&#13;
growth declined from 4.0 percent in 1977 to 0.4 percent in 1979, while&#13;
inflation rose from 49 percent in 1978 to 81 percent in 1979.2/&#13;
The government introduced a bold and comprehensive policy package in&#13;
January 1980 to correct the rapidly worsening economic situation, and to&#13;
redirect growth toward exports with a greater reliance on market forces. The&#13;
package included substantial increases in the prices of public enterprises;&#13;
elimination of price controls for a wide range of industrial products; a major&#13;
currency devaluation; improved incentives for exports; better conditions for&#13;
foreign private capital; and a flexible policy for further exchange rate&#13;
adjustments.   The monetary side of the package was strengthened in July 1980&#13;
when most of the interest rates in the banking system were freed.      Turkey's&#13;
military government, which assumed power in September 1980, supported the new&#13;
policy framework, and moved to consolidate its components under more stable&#13;
institutional arrangements.   Following the massive cost-push and deflationary&#13;
impacts of these measures during 1980, the Turkish economy showed an&#13;
improvement in 1981, with particularly encouraging results in export&#13;
expansion, public finance and control over monetary expansion.&#13;

2. PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT, 1953-78:&#13;
An Overview&#13;
This study of Turkish development is based on previous work&#13;
concerning patterns of development.    The stages of structural transformation&#13;
generally experienced by a developing country have been investigated by&#13;
Chenery  and   Taylor   (1968)  and  Chenery   and  Syrquin   (1975).     These&#13;
investigations attempt to determine average or normal patterns of development&#13;
for all countries, as opposed to factors in development for a specific&#13;
country. They provide a quantitative basis to examine how Turkish development&#13;
conforms to or diverges from the norms predicted for a country of its size (as&#13;
measured by population), income level and, in some comparisons, net resource&#13;
inflow.&#13;
Chenery and Syrquin suggested that there are ten development&#13;
processes in structural transformation.    Six stages are related to resource&#13;
accumulation and allocation, and four to demographic and income distributional&#13;
aspects.    For this   study, their actual and predicted     values have been&#13;
determined for the benchmark years 1953, 1963, 1973 and 1978. The results are&#13;
summarized  in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 A/       Cyclical influences have not been&#13;
eliminated in 1978, during which severe shortages of intermediate goods&#13;
imports  and   disruptions  in   industrial  production   occurred.    In   the&#13;
determination of the predicted values from the basic regressions of Chenery-&#13;

According   to   the  cross-country   regressions,   Turkey's   overall&#13;
development transition should have been half-completed by 1973, when per&#13;
capita  income was above $300.      This is based on the findings that some&#13;
development processes occur in earlier stages of overall transition, while&#13;
others are delayed until later stages, with the stages measured by per capita&#13;
income ranging from $100 (least developed) to $1000 (most developed), in 1964&#13;
prices. 2/   For example, on the average, the transition is half-completed at&#13;
about $300 for all ten processes, whereas the midpoint for investment,&#13;
savings, school enrollment ratio, food consumption, primary production, total&#13;
exports and imports and urbanization is around $200, and at much higher levels&#13;
for others.&#13;
1/ In order to reduce the upward bias caused by overvalued exchange rates,&#13;
per capita income levels for the benchmark years are estimated by&#13;
deflating national income series to constant 1964 prices, and using the&#13;
nominal 1964 exchange rate of 9.00 TL per US dollar for conversions. The&#13;
latter rate was a relatively realistic value at the time. The population&#13;
figures used in the calculations exclude workers employed abroad.&#13;

Based on the evaluation of structural transition in terms of the ten&#13;
development processes, Turkey had the following characteristics:&#13;
(1)      In the 1950s and early 1960s, Turkey performed substantially below&#13;
the predicted levels for a country of its size and income in the accumulation&#13;
of capital and skills, the restructure of domestic demand and production, and,&#13;
particularly,  the  development   of  a  "normal"  export base.      The  actual&#13;
government revenues (excluding public factor income) were comparable to the&#13;
predicted values, but their composition and patterns of usage must be studied&#13;
separately.&#13;
(2)      Unlike the preceding ten years, from 1963-73 there was considerable&#13;
structural transformation in capital accumulation and primary schooling as&#13;
well as in reduction of the share of primary production. In this period, the&#13;
change in the share of industrial labor was unexpectedly low in view of the&#13;
rapid pace of population growth and urbanization, and the continuing large&#13;
labor surplus in rural areas. (See Table 5.1)       Despite favorable economic&#13;
conditions in the early 1970s, the shares of total and industrial exports&#13;
continued to remain drastically below cross-country norms.&#13;
(3)      Income distribution, described in terms of the shares of the highest&#13;
20 percent and lowest 40 percent, is comparable with the typical country&#13;
standards.   However, the 1963 and 1973 figures indicate a decline for the&#13;
poorest groups that benefited mainly upper-middle income classes from 1963-73,&#13;
as discussed by the Turkish State Planning Organization (SPO), (1976).&#13;
(4)      The share of educational expenditure in GDP was comparatively low in&#13;
1953-63, but showed an increase after 1963.     This was also reflected by the&#13;
improvement in school enrollment ratios during those years. From 1963-78, the&#13;
increase in primary and secondary school enrollment (taken as a whole) mainly&#13;
indicated the expansion of primary schooling.       As a result, the need for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
development of secondary school capacities, particularly in the field of&#13;
vocational training, is not apparent from these figures.&#13;
(5)      Changes   between  1973   and  1978  reflected   the  continuation   of&#13;
structural trends in 1963-73, and led to the further restructuring of domestic&#13;
demand and production. However, because the actual trade ratios for 1978 were&#13;
still markedly below the cross-country norms, the urgency of shifting toward a&#13;
trade orientation is clear. The growth-limiting effects of the lower share of&#13;
imports in GDP were accentuated by the smaller share of non-petroleum products&#13;
in total imports in 1978 as compared to the share in 1973.&#13;
(6)      The  relatively high   share of tax    revenue  in GDP in 1973 and,&#13;
particularly, 1978 largely reflects the distorting effects of inflation on&#13;
income tax, which was based on tax schedules that had not been changed since&#13;
1963.   The progressive tax rates applied to the rapidly increasing gross&#13;
salaries of public employees resulted in misleading tax increments of&#13;
considerable proportions from 1973-80, until revised income tax legislation&#13;
was adopted in 1981.&#13;
(7)      Finally, the capital inflow figures shown in Table 2.1 measure the&#13;
net imports of goods and non-factor services, and do not reflect the sizable&#13;
contribution of workers' remittances to the trade adjustment process in 1963-&#13;
78.   In terms of current account deficits, external resource inflows were&#13;
quite moderate by inter-country standards, and normally less than 2 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1963-73.&#13;
The deviations of the Turkish economic structure from the average&#13;
country patterns are particularly significant in the following four main&#13;
areas, which are examined in more detailed below:&#13;
1.       The actual export/GDP ratios have been far below the cross-country&#13;
norms throughout 1953-78.      This indicates   the inward orientation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
development strategy.&#13;
2.       The actual import/GDP ratios have been higher than those for exports,&#13;
but still markedly below the predicted values.    This suggests the relatively&#13;
narrow scope for import substitution at the economy-wide level.&#13;
3.       Although  the  Turkish   industrialization  process  was  considerably&#13;
delayed until 1963, the subsequent catching-up effort has been significant in&#13;
terms of the rising share of industry in total value added.&#13;
4.       The share of industry in total employment has remained below cross-&#13;
country standards.   This indicates the need for more labor-absorbing patterns&#13;
of industrial growth in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. SOURCES OF INDUSTRIALIZATION, 1953-73&#13;
A. Scope of the Analysis&#13;
As comparison of Turkey's development with the cross-country norms&#13;
discussed in Chapter 2 indicated, a considerable amount of restructuring in&#13;
domestic production occurred during 1953-73 despite the continued lag with&#13;
"normal"  trade  patterns.    Chapter  3 examines    the  sources  of  different&#13;
expansion of sectors, which led to a rapid increase of the share of industry&#13;
in total production.&#13;
The changes in sectoral production (or gross output) have been&#13;
explained in terms of the following four factors:&#13;
1.   Domestic final demand expansion&#13;
2.   Export expansion&#13;
3.   Import substitution&#13;
4.   Technological change or changes in input-output coefficients.&#13;
The analysis has been conducted in empirically-based input-output&#13;
(I-0) frameworks incorporating these factors. The relative importance (or, in&#13;
mathematical terms, weights) of these sources of growth have been determined&#13;
for different sectoral aggregations at various times in order to compare&#13;
sectors and/or time periods as policy orientation shifts.     The computational&#13;
process of distinguishing and estimating the relative weights of these factors&#13;
is known as decomposition analysis.&#13;
The estimates for the sources of gross output growth also provide a&#13;
basis to explain changes in sectoral value added and factor use in terms of&#13;
the same causal factors plus changes in value added and factor coefficients,&#13;
respectively. With minor modifications, the analytical framework is also used&#13;
to estimate the sources of import growth to shed additional light on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
process of import substitution experienced in the economy.     In this section,&#13;
the estimates for the sources of gross output and import growth are derived&#13;
for the various subperiods of 1953-73. The sources of changes in value added&#13;
are examined for 1963-68 and 1968-73 only, because complete I-0 tables are&#13;
unavailable for the earlier periods, for which the interindustry data have&#13;
been compiled on a partial basis.     The sources of change in factor use are&#13;
analyzed in Chapter 4.&#13;
The type of sources of growth analysis used here is different from&#13;
the production function approach, which relates output expansion to changes in&#13;
factor inputs and productivities-11    In this study, the process of sectoral&#13;
growth is primarily considered from the demand side based on the consistent&#13;
accounting identities of input-output relations.    There are two methods that&#13;
can be used to analyze growth from this perspective.      The first approach is&#13;
known as the constant composition method (referred to hereinafter as the&#13;
"composition method").   Following the tradition of the celebrated analysis of&#13;
Chenery, Shishido and Watanabe (CSW, 1962) for Japan, it attempts to explain&#13;
the nonproportional expansion of sectoral output in terms of the non-&#13;
proportional growth of causal factors observed in individual sectors.&#13;
Nonproportional growth is measured by deviations from the balanced (or norm)&#13;
growth path, in which all elements expand proportionally at the growth rate of&#13;
aggregate demand or aggregate value added.&#13;
The second approach is designated the constant share method&#13;
(referred  to hereinafter as    the  "share method").     It differs   from  the&#13;
composition method in the treatment of import substitution as a cause of&#13;
expansion. The share method, which was elaborated by Syrquin (1976), defines&#13;
1/ In Chapter 4, the roles of labor reallocation and productivity changes in&#13;
the aggregate growth process are briefly considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the constant (initial year) share of imports in domestic demand as the norm in&#13;
individual sectors, and defines import substitution in terms of changes in the&#13;
import (or, symmetrically, domestic supply) shares rather than changes in the&#13;
commodity  composition  of  imports.    In  contrast,  the  composition method&#13;
measures import substitution in terms of deviations of sectoral import&#13;
expansion from the expected growth path, or from the constant (initial year)&#13;
composition of sectoral imports.     The share method also allows two sets of&#13;
decomposition    measures    which    explain    different    phenomena   under&#13;
consideration.  Changes in the relevant factors are defined in terms of first&#13;
differences (or increments) and/or deviations from propositional growth.&#13;
While the deviation measures clarify the causes of structural change (seen in&#13;
compositional shifts), the first difference measures are used in examining&#13;
growth processes and policy effects in individual sectors.&#13;
For both methods, changes in intermediate input requirements have&#13;
been studied to differentiate the direct and indirect demand effects on&#13;
growth.   The decomposition analysis has been divided into two variations,&#13;
known as the direct and total methods.1J       The total measures combine the&#13;
direct and indirect (known as backward-linkage) effects of changes in domestic&#13;
final demand, exports and import substitution, and identify changes in I-0&#13;
coefficients (which represent technological change) as a separate source of&#13;
growth.l/ In turn, the direct measures include all intermediate uses of the&#13;
products of a particular sector under the domestic demand contribution to the&#13;
growth process.&#13;
1/ These terms also apply to variations of any approach in the sources of&#13;
growth literature.&#13;
2/ In the abeence of separate import matrices for all benchmark years, the&#13;
present analysis quantifies the effects of changes in total (rather than&#13;
domestic) I-0 coefficients as a source of growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
The   choice  of   initial  or   terminal   year  coefficients   (and&#13;
correspondingly terminal or initial year volume weights) in the decomposition&#13;
equations is important.     This issue has been treated as an index number&#13;
problem by separately estimating the Laspeyres and Paasche indices on the&#13;
basis of structural coefficients being taken as the relevant weights. 1/ The&#13;
arithmetic means of these two indices are used here (unless otherwise&#13;
indicated)  to reduce possible bias in the estimation process.         For time&#13;
intervals consisting of at least two subperiods, the averages of the Laspeyres&#13;
and Paasche measures for successive subperiods are simply summed to obtain the&#13;
"chained" measures for sources of growth.       Appendix 1 provides a method-&#13;
ological review of the sources of growth models of the types employed in the&#13;
present study, and gives the algebraic formulations of the decomposition&#13;
equations under the variant methods.&#13;
B. Basic Data&#13;
The data base consists of interindustry data analyzed for five&#13;
benchmark years spaced at five-year intervals from 1953-73.       The three I-0&#13;
tables compiled by the official agencies for the years 1963, 1968 and 1973&#13;
have been adjusted for differences in sector coverage, reorganized in 25x25&#13;
sector matrices, and deflated to constant 1968 domestic prices.2/ Before the&#13;
1/ In the cases where the initial year I-0 matrix is not available (e.g., for&#13;
time periods starting with 1953 in the Turkish case), a modified form of&#13;
Laspeyres index is used, as noted in Appendix 1.&#13;
2/ The SPO made an earlier attempt to prepare a 15 sector table for 1959,&#13;
which is not comparable with the later tables because of the differences&#13;
in sector classification and price conventions.     See Korum (1963) for a&#13;
detailed review of the 1959 table.    Another unpublished table by the SP0&#13;
for 1967 has not been used in the present study.        The 1963 table was&#13;
compiled by the SP0, while the 1968 and 1973 tables were published by the&#13;
State Institute of Statistics.    See Appendix 2 for a detailed account of&#13;
the deflation work needed to prepare a consistent set of data for this&#13;
study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
data was deflated, the 1963 I-0 table required substantial adjustments in the&#13;
imputed values of some of the component parts of agricultural and livestock&#13;
outputs   (such  as   straw,   pasture  and   animal  services),   and   in  the&#13;
classification of utilities, public services, crude oil and oil refining&#13;
sectors. The treatment of cotton ginning also had to be modified in the 1973&#13;
I-0 table to ensure compatability with the export commodity classification of&#13;
the earlier tables.&#13;
The data for the benchmark years 1953 and 1958 represent 1952-54 and&#13;
1957-59 averages to minimize the distorting effects of cyclical factors in the&#13;
analysis.   In the absence of complete I-0 matrices for these two benchmark&#13;
years, the gross output, domestic final and intermediate demand, and trade&#13;
data were estimated at the 25 sector level of aggregation to establish the&#13;
minimum levels for estimating the sources of output and import growth for&#13;
periods starting with 1953 or 1958.21    In the latter stages of the research,&#13;
the  year  1958  was  dropped   from  the  analysis.    It appeared   to be   an&#13;
inappropriate benchmark year because of unusually severe import shortages and&#13;
economic disruptions.&#13;
The figures totalled from the deflated I-0 data of this study are&#13;

commodity trade data from the United Nations Yearbook of International&#13;
Trade Statistics was processed according to the trade classifications of&#13;
the 1963 and 1968 I-0 tables, and then deflated to constant prices by&#13;
deflators given in Annex II. The net output figures of Ecevit and Ozotun&#13;
(1974) and various SIS sources were converted into gross output estimates&#13;
on the basis of available production data. For estimation of the elements&#13;
of domestic demand, the data analysis drew upon partial official data&#13;
available on fixed investment and various estimates based on income&#13;
elasticities for private consumption.&#13;

C. Policy Characteristics and Trade Orientation of the Subperiods /&#13;
Formal development planning began in the early 1960s.     Following a&#13;
brief favorable trade cycle in 1948-53, the Turkish economy experienced severe&#13;
external  and  internal  imbalances  in  1954-58.    As  a result,    a drastic&#13;
stabilization program including a massive devaluation was adopted in 1958.&#13;
Aided by sizable foreign assistance, growth gradually resumed, and price&#13;
stability was restored in 1959-62..L/ The First (1963-67) and Second (1968-72)&#13;
Five-Year Plans, implemented the following decade, placed a greater emphasis&#13;
on resource mobilization and coordination of the growth process.&#13;
Nonetheless, the restrictive trade regime and related incentives did&#13;
not fundamentally change until more externally-oriented policy attitudes&#13;
appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s.        The sizable devaluation and&#13;
reduced quantitative restrictions in 1970 permitted Turkey to take more&#13;
advantage of the favorable international trade environment in 1970-73, and&#13;
stimulated the inflow of workers remittances, which came mainly from OECD-&#13;
Europe.    However,  following the first oil price shock in 1973-74,       real&#13;
incentives and other corrective measures to improve the balance of payments&#13;
were not maintained.   As a result, Turkey experienced huge losses in foreign&#13;
exchange reserves and a sharp rise in external indebtedness.     These problems&#13;
finally led to another deep crisis in 1978-80.&#13;
The following policy characteristics for Turkey during 1953-73 are&#13;
described by Kubo and Robinson (1979), based on the scheme of classification&#13;
developed by Bhagwati (1978) and Krueger (1978) for trade and exchange rate&#13;
regimes in developing countries:&#13;
1/ 1953-63, 1963-68, 1968-73. 1958 is excluded as aberrant.&#13;
2/ See Krueger (1974) and Okyar (1979) for detailed accounts of Turkey's&#13;
economic policy experience in 1953-63.&#13;

Semi-closed    implies    encouraging     import    substitution    and&#13;
discriminating against exports.&#13;
Semi-open indicates reduced quantity restriction (QR).&#13;
I - intense QR&#13;
II - intense QR with corrective measures&#13;
III - formal devaluation and/or reduced reliance on QR&#13;
IV - further reduction of QR&#13;
These characterizations will be used to examine the interperiod differences in&#13;
growth patterns, with the qualifying remark that the semi-open period 1968-73&#13;
involved continued (albeit reduced) discrimination against exports under a&#13;
trade regime which still prohibited a wide range of consumer goods imports.L/&#13;
The trade ratios shown in Table 3.2 provide additional information&#13;
on the general trade orientation at various times from 1948-78 and point to&#13;
the general character of the sources of growth that will be analyzed in more&#13;
detail.   Low export shares in GDP in 1953-63 and 1963-68 suggest the limited&#13;
role of exports in growth during the semi-closed phases of development.      The&#13;
import shares in 1963 and 1968 were considerably lower than the 1953 ratio,&#13;
and indicate significant import substitution in the 1953-68 period. In turn,&#13;
the upward shift in the export/GDP ratio in 1968-73 (particularly in 1973) was&#13;
accompanied by a rise in the import/GDP ratio.         These increases imply a&#13;
decline in the relative importance of import substitution to the overall&#13;

growth process.    However, as the figures in Table 3.2 broadly suggest, the&#13;
trend in declining import substitution continued in 1973-77, but it was not&#13;
accompanied by export-oriented restructuring in domestic production.!I&#13;
Consequently, the sharp fall in the imports/GDP ratio in 1978 signalled the&#13;
emergence of a massive external imbalance in the economy.&#13;
Tables 3.3 and 3.4 present a set of complementary data. Output and&#13;
trade growth are broken down by major sectors in the two successive ten-year&#13;
periods of 1953-63 and 1963-73.     As these tables show, economic growth was&#13;
more rapid in 1963-73.     In addition, it was accompanied by a considerable&#13;
change in the sectoral mix of output. The share of the primary sectors in GDP&#13;
(m.p.) declined from 41.5 percent in 1963 to 22.7 percent in 1973, while the&#13;
share of manufacturing increased from 11.5 percent to 21.2 percent. Although&#13;
the high rates of protection in Turkey undoubtedly cause industrial shares to&#13;
be overestimated, shifts toward manufacturing and other non-agricultural&#13;
sectors clearly indicate a transitional process toward industrialization.._/&#13;
The sources of growth analysis represents an empirical attempt to measure the&#13;
relative importance of several factors which affected and shaped such a&#13;
process.&#13;
D. Sources of Growth and Structural Change: An Economy-Wide Analysis&#13;
Internal factors were prominent sources of industrialization in&#13;
Turkey's recent economic history. The decomposition measures for the sources&#13;
of growth and structural change in gross output (production) and value added&#13;
are  first  aggregated and   examined  at  the national   economy  level.    The&#13;
aggregate first difference measures are calculated from the algebraic sums of&#13;

sectoral changes, whereas the economy-wide deviation measures are based on the&#13;
absolute totals of sectoral deviations, disregarding their algebraic signs.&#13;
The measures derived from the decomposition of gross output are shown in&#13;
percentage terms in Table 3.5 (a and b) for all the methods used in the&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Table 3.5 shows that the relative importance of the relevant factors&#13;
significantly varies according to which decomposition measure is used.      This&#13;
indicates which factors contributed more to growth (as represented by the&#13;
first difference measures) or to structural change (as represented by the&#13;
deviation measures).    Under the first difference measure,     the increase in&#13;
domestic final demand accounted for 87.3 percent of the increase in total&#13;
gross  output   in  1953-73.     Yet,  according   to  the  deviation   measure,&#13;
nonproportional growth of this factor explained 49.4 percent of the structural&#13;
change in production.    Technological change is also a significant factor in&#13;
nonproportional expansion (structural change), in addition to its minor role&#13;
in total growth.&#13;
Table 3.5 also indicates the significance of trade in growth and&#13;
structural  change.    From  1953-73  the combined   trade  effects  (of export&#13;
expansion and import substitution) accounted for 9.5 percent of growth (first&#13;
difference total measure), and 15.5 percent of the structural change in the&#13;
overall economy   (deviation total measure).     Import substitution was more&#13;
important in structural change than aggregate growth (6.3 versus 2.4 percent).&#13;
Yet the differences in the growth and structural effects of export expansion&#13;
are  less  pronounced  in nearly   all  subperiods.     This  reflects  relative&#13;
stability in the commodity composition of exports during the period.&#13;
Furthermore, a comparison of the total measures with the direct&#13;
measures indicates the predominant role of domestic final demand expansion in&#13;

1/  All measures represent arithmetic averages of the estimates obtained from the Layspeyres and Paasche indices.      The&#13;
estimates for the periods marked by (*), 1963-73 and 1953-73, are the chained measures for the two (1963-68&#13;
and 1968-73) and three (1953-63, 1963-68 and 1968-73) periods spanned, respectively. The deviation measures&#13;
are the relative weights calculated from absolute totals of sectoral deviations under each causal factor. The&#13;
calculations are based on 25 sector 1-0 data in constant 1968 domestic prices.&#13;

generating intermediate demand increases. This result, known as the backward&#13;
linkage effect, explains about 37 percent of the increase in total output from&#13;
1953-73.   Under deviation analysis, nonproportional growth of intermediate&#13;
demand is largely attributed to the effects of technological change rather&#13;
than to the nonproportional growth of domestic final demand.      Additionally,&#13;
the backward linkage effects of trade factors on the general economy appear to&#13;
be small, except in 1963-68 and 1968-73 when import substitution and export&#13;
expansion, respectively, became more important.&#13;
A general view of the economy also demonstrates the varying&#13;
proportions of trade effects over time.   The relative contributions of import&#13;
substitution were higher than those of export expansion during 1953-63 and&#13;
1963-68, while a sharp reversal occurred in their relative roles in 1968-73.&#13;
These results are broadly in line with the shifts in trade policies previously&#13;
noted.   According to the measures calculated separately for 1953-68, import&#13;
substitution had a significant impact on structural change in production under&#13;
the semi-closed development policies of the 1950s and 1960s, but it lost most&#13;
of its influence in the early 1970s.&#13;
The differences in the treatment of import substitution under these&#13;
various approaches is indicated by a comparison of the deviation measures&#13;
obtained under the composition and share methods.        Under the composition&#13;
method, which treats import substitution in relation to total GDP rather than&#13;
to sector demand, the relative contribution of import substitution appears to&#13;
be affected by variations in the nonproportional growth rates of imports.&#13;
This point will be discussed below in regard to the major sectors.&#13;
The measures for the decomposition of value added are also combined&#13;
at the national economy level, as shown in Table 3.6. These measures support&#13;
the findings of the decomposition analysis for gross output discussed above.&#13;

Furthermore, the additional factor found in value added analysis (the change&#13;
in value added coefficients) made negative contributions to growth, but&#13;
strongly influenced structural change in value added during 1963-73.         The&#13;
measures summarized in Table 3.6 reinforce the overall findings that internal&#13;
factors were prominent sources of industrialization in Turkey's recent&#13;
economic history.&#13;
E. Sources of Growth and Structural Change in Gross Output: An Analysis by&#13;
Major Sectors&#13;
The results of the decomposition of gross output are reported at the&#13;
9 sector level in Tables 3.7 (a and b) and 3.8 for growth and structural&#13;
change, respectively. Manufacturing industries have been classified into five&#13;
major groups (or sectors) which exhibited varying patterns of growth from&#13;
1953-73.    In  these   tables,  the  decomposition  measures   are  also  given&#13;
separately for total manufacturing and for manufacturing excluding food and&#13;
textiles, mainly to crystallize the nature of trade effects in manufacturing.&#13;
Growth of Gross Output: First Difference Measures&#13;
For different intervals during 1953-73, Table 3.7 (a and b) gives&#13;
the direct and total first difference decomposition measures for major&#13;
sectors.  The chained measures for 1963-73 are dominated by the estimates for&#13;
1968-73, which was characterized by larger increases in gross output in most&#13;
sectors.    The analysis of the sources of agricultural output growth is&#13;
affected by the choice of benchmark years which do not have the same weather&#13;
conditions.   For example, the excellent harvest of 1963 meant that a large&#13;
increase in agricultural output was recorded in 1953-63 but that a limited&#13;
increase was noted in 1963-68.&#13;

Despite the distortions caused by weather fluctuations, the&#13;
predominant role of domestic demand expansion in agricultural growth&#13;
throughout the entire period is obvious.      The major difference between the&#13;
direct and total measures for domestic demand contribution is a result of the&#13;
indirect effects of domestic final demand expansion on the food processing&#13;
industries. The implied shifts in the relative shares of agriculture and food&#13;
processing in total private consumption reflect the effects of urbanization&#13;
and income increases on consumption patterns.       The larger contribution of&#13;
export expansion to agricultural growth in the last part of the period is also&#13;
notable, particularly in the form of intermediate demand generated by food and&#13;
textile exports.   As observed previously, the net contribution of changes in&#13;
input-output coefficients has been negative in agricultural growth, mainly due&#13;
to declining proportions of traditional (intra-sectoral) inputs in crop and&#13;
livestock production.&#13;
The mining industry is a small primary sector in Turkey's productive&#13;
structure. Its expansion has been constrained by numerous institutional and&#13;
technological factors.   In the early 1950s, mineral exports were moderately&#13;
important, and their subsequent decline is reflected in the negative&#13;
contribution of   export  expansion  to sectoral growth    from 1953-63.     The&#13;
positive effect of import substitution on growth in 1953-63 and 1963-68 ended&#13;
in 1968-73 mainly because of increasing imports of crude oil and phosphate&#13;
rock in the early 1970s.     In the expansion of mining output, intermediate&#13;
demand resulting from final demand growth in other sectors (e.g.,&#13;
construction) was a dominant factor in all periods.      The rise in the direct&#13;
contribution of domestic final demand expansion in 1963-73 mainly corresponds&#13;
to the increased share of coal in residential heating as non-commercial fuel&#13;
sources were gradually replaced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The expanded role of technological change in the last subperiod&#13;
(1968-73) had a significant impact on the mining industry.     This development&#13;
was the result of the increasing share of raw minerals in intermediate inputs&#13;
required by the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.        These trends in&#13;
mineral use became more prominent in 1973-77, and caused a rapid growth of oil&#13;
and non-oil mineral imports when domestic supply adjustments did not occur.&#13;
In manufacturing, domestic final demand expansion (with its total&#13;
effects) accounted for 81 and 76 percent of the growth in gross output in&#13;
1953-63 and 1963-73, respectively.     With technological change contributing&#13;
about 8 and 13 percent in these two periods, internal factors clearly played&#13;
an  overwhelming  role in the overall expansion      of  this  sector.   Export&#13;
expansion and import substitution together accounted for only 11 percent of&#13;
the manufacturing output growth in the entire 1953-73 period.&#13;
The relative contributions of export expansion and import substitu-&#13;
tion to manufacturing growth varied significantly over time and by major&#13;
sectors.    During  1953-63  and  1963-68,  total  import substitution effects&#13;
accounted for 18 and 14 percent of the gross output increases in manufacturing&#13;
(excluding food and textiles), but their relative contribution turned negative&#13;
(for the same group)    in 1968-73.    Export expansion was an insignificant&#13;
contributor to manufacturing growth in 1953-63, but became important for food&#13;
processing in 1963-68.   In the subsequent period of 1968-73, export expansion&#13;
explained 20 and 22 percent of the production increases in food and textiles,&#13;
respectively, while accounting for nearly 11 percent of the aggregate growth&#13;
in total manufacturing.&#13;
Domestic demand expansion was the predominant source of gross output&#13;
growth in the social overhead and services sectors.        The positive export&#13;
contributions of these major sectors largely reflect changes in transport and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

in trade margins on commodity exports, rather than increases in invisible&#13;
exports such as tourism and shipping.        With  import substitution playing&#13;
practically no role in their expansion, social overhead and services exhibited&#13;
the typical patterns of nontradable sectors in the growth process.-/&#13;
Structural Change in Gross Output: Deviation Measures&#13;
Table 3.8 indicates the decomposition of nonproportional output&#13;
expansions in major sectors for 1953-63 and 1963-73.     The reported estimates&#13;
are the total measures obtained under the share and composition methods. The&#13;
measurement of import substitution in relation to changes in GDP results in&#13;
rather exaggerated estimates of its role under the composition method, which&#13;
implicitly treats imports as perfect substitutes for domestic goods.          In&#13;
particular, according to the composition method, import substitution provided&#13;
a large negative contribution (-19 percent) to the nonproportional growth of&#13;
manufacturing gross output in 1963-73, during which manufactured imports&#13;
increased 135 percent, as compared to 82 percent growth in aggregate value&#13;
added (see Tables 3.3 and 3.4).    In turn, by focusing on the changes in the&#13;
shares of imports in total demand in individual sectors, the share method&#13;
produces import substitution measures more consistent with the rigidities&#13;
actually  faced  in  the substitution of    imports  by domestic   goods.    The&#13;
following observations at the sector level are, therefore, based on the&#13;
deviation measures derived under the total share method.&#13;
The sectoral estimates for the sources of nonproportional growth&#13;
support the general conclusions reached on the basis of the overall analysis&#13;
discussed above. The compositional shifts in domestic final demand accounted&#13;
1/ In the 1980s, the direct effects of export expansion are likely to be&#13;
larger in the social overhead sector due to growing invisible foreign&#13;
exchange earnings from interregional road transport activities.&#13;

f or 47 and 70 percent of the negative deviations in agricultural gross output&#13;
.in 1953-63 and 1963-73, respectively.    This factor alone explains 56 percent&#13;
of the large positive deviations observed in manufacturing (excluding food and&#13;
textiles) during 1963-73. These trends in nonproportional growth were further&#13;
strengthened by the effects from technological change, which caused negative&#13;
output deviations in agriculture, and generally positive deviations in&#13;
manufacturing subsectors.    The combined deviation effects of domestic final&#13;
demand and technological change were also dominant in the differential growth&#13;
of social overhead and services. The latter two sectors experienced important&#13;
structural change contributions from export expansion in 1963-73. This mainly&#13;
reflected the effects of the export boom of the early 1970s.&#13;
The disaggregated estimates in Table 3.8 also indicate that import&#13;
substitution was a sizable source of nonproportional growth in manufacturing&#13;
in 1953-63.   It accounted for 59 percent of the gross output deviations in&#13;
manufacturing (excluding food and textiles) in the early period.      This trend&#13;
continued in 1963-68,   but was reversed in 1968-73.      The chained measures&#13;
attribute about 9 percent of the total manufacturing output deviation to the&#13;
import substitution process in 1963-73.      In contrast, the nonproportional&#13;
growth of exports had a negligible impact on the compositional changes in&#13;
manufacturing output in 1953-63, but accounted for nearly 16 percent of the&#13;
gross output deviations in total manufacturing in 1963-73, with particularly&#13;
pronounced effects in the food and textile groups.&#13;
According to the analysis, the nonproportional expansion of domestic&#13;
final demand and the changes in input-output coefficients were the two major&#13;
sources of structural change in gross output.      The changing composition of&#13;
domestic final demand with rising national income was not a straight-forward&#13;
process in 1953-73, but represented the combined effects of four main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
factors:   (1) differential growth of investment and consumption expenditures,&#13;
which resulted in a faster expansion of demand for investment goods; (2)&#13;
increasing proportions of machinery and equipment in fixed investment, which&#13;
were due to shifting patterns of investment by sector of destination&#13;
(particularly in 1963-73); (3) non-uniform income elasticities of consumer&#13;
demand, which produced the typical decline in the share of agriculture and&#13;
food, with a corresponding rise in the shares of manufactures and services (at&#13;
varying speeds in urban and rural areas); and (4) a faster rise in public&#13;
consumption than in private consumption, resulting in the disproportionate&#13;
increase of the share of public services in aggregate demand.      To underline&#13;
the broad shifts in the structure of domestic final demand, the orders of&#13;
magnitude of the implied expenditure elasticities of demand for major&#13;
categories of goods and services have been compared as follows:_/&#13;
1953-63    1963-73    1953-73&#13;
Agriculture and Food                      0.83       0.30       0.46&#13;
Textiles and Clothing                     1.07       1.04       1.06&#13;
Other Manufactures                        0.93       2.67       2.06&#13;
Social Overhead                           1.12       1.15       1.14&#13;
Services                                  1.15       1.11       1.16&#13;
In addition,   the nature of the effects of technological change&#13;
appear to be somewhat different from those observed in countries with limited&#13;
supplies of natural resources, like Japan and Korea. In the industrialization&#13;
of such countries, the major contribution of technological change has been to&#13;
substitute limited local primary inputs with manufactured goods and thus to&#13;
1/ These are not the Engel elasticities of private consumer demand, but the&#13;
implied expenditure elasticities of total domestic final demand.        The&#13;
elasticities for agriculture and services would have been higher if&#13;
relative price effects were to be considered (see Chapter 4.E).          The&#13;
fluctuatingvvalues of stock changes in agriculture also had an effect on&#13;
the observed elasticities for agriculture and food.&#13;

reduce dependence on primary imports,./&#13;
In the Turkish case, changes in input-output coefficients do not&#13;
reflect primarily a similar major effort to replace imported primary products&#13;
by fabricated goods. Rather, three broad elements are represented:&#13;
(1) Changes in the intra-sectoral product flows of the agriculture-&#13;
livestock-food complex (e.g., less animal service, more processed feed for&#13;
livestock, and higher stages of food processing which require proportionally&#13;
less agricultural input);&#13;
(2) The introduction of new techniques and intermediate products&#13;
into various major sectors (e.g., petroleum products for transport and energy,&#13;
and chemicals for agriculture and new materials for construction); and&#13;
(3) The widening of the range within which electricity, transport,&#13;
trade and services are used as intermediate inputs.&#13;
In addition to these three factors, the effects of input&#13;
substitution that result in reduced demand for primary products (such as, for&#13;
example, increased use of synthetic fibers in the textile sector) have also&#13;
been noticeable in certain sectors.     Although the sources of growth models&#13;
track down the effects of technological change in the process of non-&#13;
proportional expansion, they generate no quantitative information on the&#13;
relative influences of a variety of factors that cause changes in input-output&#13;
coefficients.&#13;
F. Sources of Growth Patterns in Manufacturing Industries&#13;
For a more detailed examination of the pattern of expansion in&#13;
manufacturing, Table 3.9 provides disaggregated estimates for the sources of&#13;
gross output growth at the level of individual industries.      These estimates&#13;
1/ See Chenery and Watanabe (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
are in first difference terms, and derived under the share total method for&#13;
1953-63 and 1963-73.&#13;
As the estimates in Table 3.9 show, domestic final demand expansion&#13;
was a predominant source of growth in all individual industries during the&#13;
entire period.   The growth contribution of this factor was relatively higher&#13;
in machinery and textiles, lower in basic intermediates, and close to average&#13;
in  light   intermediate  industries.    In   contrast,  technological  effects&#13;
contributed strongly to basic intermediates, moderately to light Intermediates&#13;
and food processing, and negatively to textiles and machinery group during&#13;
their expansion.&#13;
The observed pattern of import substitution in 1953-63 indicates&#13;
that this factor was a significant source of growth.     Relative contributions&#13;
exceeded 20 percent in the early stages of development of a number of&#13;
industries such as non-metallic products (cement, glass, etc.), petroleum&#13;
refining, basic metals and machinery products (mainly, non-electrical).&#13;
Import substitution also contributed positively (about 8 percent) to the&#13;
output growth in textiles and rubber products.      From 1963-73, the role of&#13;
import substitution as a source of growth was reduced in machinery output (12&#13;
percent), and turned negative in basic intermediates taken as a group (-1&#13;
percent).     Notwithstanding   the   generally  declining   trend   in   import&#13;
substitution for manufacturing as a whole, the growth effects of this factor&#13;
were moderately improved in paper     (11 percent),  rubber (18 percent), and&#13;
transport equipment (11 percent).     In both ten-year period, chemicals had&#13;
negative growth contribution from import substitution.&#13;
In 1953-63, export expansion was an insignificant source of output&#13;
growth in all manufacturing branches (with the minor exception of leather&#13;
products).   In the latter decade   (especially in 1968-73),  its substantially&#13;

enhanced role was observed in the aggregate analysis.      The small positive&#13;
contributions of export expansion noted in the growth of chemicals, petroleum&#13;
refining, basic metals, rubber and paper products during 1963-73 were mainly&#13;
due to intermediate demand effects of export growth in agriculture, food and&#13;
textiles. In turn, the positive export growth contributions observed in non-&#13;
metallics and metal products largely represented the direct effects of export&#13;
expansion in these individual subsectors.      The industry breakdown of the&#13;
growth contributions of exports in the latter period reflects Turkey's&#13;
comparative advantage in food, textiles and apparels, non-metallic mineral&#13;
products, and selective items in basic metals and metal fabricating branches,&#13;
which use semi-skilled labor. 1/&#13;
Sectoral analysis of the sources of growth within manufacturing&#13;
indicates contrasting patterns of import substitution and technological change&#13;
in the basic intermediates and machinery groups.       The substantial early&#13;
contribution of import substitution to output growth in basic intermediates&#13;
declined  over  time, whereas    technological  change  continued  to  have  a&#13;
relatively large role in their expansion, particularly in the case of&#13;
chemicals. In turn, machinery and related products had more favorable import&#13;
substitutinn effects in their growth process, while experiencing generally&#13;
negative contributions from changes in input-output coefficients (except&#13;
transport  equipment   in  1963-73).     The   sustained  growth  effects   of&#13;
technological  change   in  basic  intermediates,  especially   in  chemicals,&#13;
underscores the continuing process of technological innovations and/or input&#13;
substitution in the production structure.    The latter process had important&#13;

implications for the growth of intermediate goods imports throughout the&#13;
period, as shown in Table 3.10.&#13;
G. Sources of Import Growth by Commodity&#13;
Tables 3.10 and 3.11 present estimates for the sources of import&#13;
growth by commodity (i.e., by sector of origin) during 1953-73 in aggregated&#13;
and disaggregated first difference terms,     respectively.    These estimates,&#13;
which have been derived under the share method, provide a complementary&#13;
perspective to the sectoral growth patterns.&#13;
The aggregated direct measures listed in Table 3.10 indicate that&#13;
intermediate demand expansion alone accounted for 60 percent of the import&#13;
growth in 1953-63 and 1963-73.    For the entire period 1953-73, 72 percent of&#13;
import growth induced by intermediate demand expansion was attributed to&#13;
domestic f-nal demand factor; 20 percent to technological change; and about 8&#13;
percent to export expansion and import substitution.&#13;
In aggregate terms, the relative contributions of export expansion&#13;
and import substitution to the growth of total imports were 2.8 and -26.4&#13;
percent, respectively, in 1953-73.    These figures reveal the exceedingly low&#13;
import intensity of Turkey's export-oriented production, as well as the large&#13;
extent to which trade adjustment policies relied on import substitution to&#13;
achieve balance in the external sector, especially under the semi-closed&#13;
development strategy of the 1953-68 period.11       In the semi-open period of&#13;
1968-73, import substitution contributed positively (6 percent) to the growth&#13;
of imports.&#13;

import growth during 1953-63 and 1963-73 provides further insight into the&#13;
reduced role of import substitution in restraining the growth of manufactured&#13;
imports in the latter decade.    The relative contribution of import substitu-&#13;
tion to the increment in total manufactured imports changed from -220 percent&#13;
in 1953-63 to -19 percent in 1963-73. In turn, technological change accounted&#13;
for -27 and +12 percent of the rise in total manufactured imports in these two&#13;
successive  ten-year periods.     In particular,   the rapid   increase  in the&#13;
relative contributions of domestic demand and technological change to the&#13;
expansion   of  mining   imports  (including   crude  oil),   chemicals  imports&#13;
(including fertilizers), and basic metals imports (mainly semi-finished steel&#13;
products) in 1963-73 reflected the growing import intensity of the changing&#13;
product mix and input structures in the economy. In the aftermath of the 1973&#13;
oil crisis, these structural trends in mineral and basic intermediates imports&#13;
continued, and led to a foreign exchange bottleneck in the late 1970s in the&#13;
absence of internal adjustment measures.&#13;
The predominant role of domestic demand in import increases, and&#13;
general import-replacing nature of technological change is shown by the&#13;
decomposition of imports in the machinery and related industries. However, in&#13;
the case of the transport equipment industry, which experienced rapid growth&#13;
in output toward the end of the period, technological change contributed&#13;
positively to import increases from 1963-73, while import substitution effects&#13;
were negative,   as expected.   Expressed in another way, the decline in the&#13;
share of competitive imports in the total supply of this industry was&#13;
associated with a considerable increase in intra-industry flows, which, in&#13;
turn, led to the rapid expansion of semi-finished product imports in 1963-73,&#13;
&#13;

H. Decomposition of Value Added&#13;
Table 3.12 presents the decomposition measures for value added by&#13;
major sectors for 1963-73. 3.      These measures have been derived under the&#13;
share method in first difference and deviation terms by chaining the results&#13;
obtained for the 1963-68 and 1968-73 subperiods.&#13;
An additional cause of change in the productive structure, namely&#13;
the change in value added coefficients, is examined in the decomposition of&#13;
value added.     This factor produced negative growth effects in all major&#13;
sectors except agriculture and social overhead.     Compared to the results of&#13;
the decomposition of gross output, the relative contributions of domestic&#13;
final demand expansion, technological change and import substitution are&#13;
greater as sources of growth of value added, offsetting the growth-reducing&#13;
effects of changes in value added parameters.&#13;
The relative role of exports in the decomposition of gross output&#13;
and value added is essentially the same.     The notable difference is only in&#13;
food processing.    In its nonproportional expansion, export growth accounted&#13;
for 102 and 245 percent of the deviations in value added and gross output,&#13;
respectively, with corresponding differences in the negative contribution of&#13;
domestic final demand.   This different pattern indicates the lower stages of&#13;
processing carried out for agricultural commodities such as tobacco and dried&#13;
fruits before they head for export markets.&#13;
The  earlier  conclusion    that   import  substitution  was   a  more&#13;
1/ The transport equipment industry's own input-output coefficient increased&#13;
from 0.056 in 1963 to 0.230 in 1973 in constant 1968 prices.&#13;
2/ The value added figures include indirect taxes on sectoral output and&#13;
imports according to the definitions given in Appendix 2.B.&#13;

significant source of structural change than growth in manufacturing is&#13;
supported by the results of the decomposition of value added.      The sectoral&#13;
measures shown in Table 3.12 also illustrate the reverse roles of import&#13;
substitution and technological change in the development of machinery and&#13;

I. Sources of Turkish Industrialization in the Light of Experience&#13;
Elsewhere: An Overview&#13;
The empirical analysis presented in the preceding parts of Chapter 3&#13;
provides extensive estimates for the sources of Turkish industrialization,&#13;
which   was  characterized   by   a  significant   nonproportional   growth  of&#13;
manufacturing production in 1953-73. The various components of the sources of&#13;
growth analysis clearly indicate the predominant effects of domestic final&#13;
demand and technological change in Turkey's past industrialization process.&#13;
These factors were complemented somewhat by import substitution in 1953-68,&#13;
and by export expansion in 1968-73. The increased role of exports in 1968-73&#13;
is attributed both to shifts in trade and exchange rate policies and to more&#13;
favorable external factors in the early 1970s.    Table 3.13 gives a summary of&#13;
the first difference measures obtained from the decomposition of gross output,&#13;
imports (by commodity) and value added in total manufacturing. Estimates for&#13;
the sources of employment expansion for manufacturing are listed to show the&#13;
basic similarity of the factors that affected the various aspects of growth in&#13;
this sector 1/&#13;
To compare the Turkish experience in industrialization with the&#13;
seven other countries in this series, two additional tables have been compiled&#13;
1/ See Chapter 4 for a more detailed analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
(under the share method).1/ Table 3.14 provides estimates for the sources of&#13;
nonproportional growth of manufacturing as percentages of the increase in&#13;
total gross output in individual economies over comparable sample periods of&#13;
ten to twenty years. Turkey experienced the highest relative contributions of&#13;
domestic final demand (5.6 percent) and technological change (6.2 percent) to&#13;
the manufacturing gross output deviation from balanced growth among the eight&#13;
countries studied.   The narrow role of export expansion was observed not only&#13;
in Turkey, but also in Colombia and Mexico, which experienced substantially&#13;
larger effects of import substitution as well.     Export expansion as a source&#13;
of differential growth of manufacturing was most pronounced in Korea and&#13;
Taiwan, where the growth rates of manufacturing output were also the highest&#13;
among the eight countries.&#13;
In turn, Table 3.15 gives the measures for the sources of&#13;
manufacturing gross output increases in terms of percentages of the increment&#13;
in this sector's gross output at various times.     These estimates support the&#13;
results listed in Table 3.14. Moreover, the pronounced shifts observed in the&#13;
sources of growth patterns over time in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Israel&#13;
suggest that the switching from import substitution to export orientation in&#13;
the course of industrial development was successful.        Compared to Korea,&#13;
Taiwan and Israel, the inward-oriented phase of manufacturing growth was too&#13;
prolonged in Turkey.   One result was a highly protected industrial structure,&#13;
which relied heavily on the imports of intermediate goods.&#13;
Turkey's industrialization pattern in 1953-73 substantially supports&#13;
the theory of "balanced growth," which attempts to explain the structural&#13;

indicated in the analysis of the cross-country norms in Chapter 2). While the&#13;
effects of import substitution on the process of growth and structural change&#13;
in production were only moderate, its role as a trade adjustment mechanism was&#13;
substantial, according to the decomposition of import growth, particularly in&#13;
1953-63 and 1963-68.   (For example, see the sources of growth of manufactured&#13;
imports  in  Table  3.13).     The  effects  of  export  expansion  and  import&#13;
substitution on the patterns of factor allocation are examined in Chapter 4.&#13;

4. SOURCES OF CHANGES in FACTOR USES AND&#13;
RELATIVE PRICES&#13;
Despite the relatively rapid growth of the manufacturing sector,&#13;
Turkey's structural transition was not accompanied by sufficient increases in&#13;
employment. Employment opportunities in Western Europe for Turkish workers in&#13;
the 1960s and early 1970s eased Turkey's unemployment problems at the time,&#13;
but also encouraged complacency toward employment-related policy issues.&#13;
Furthermore, compositional shifts in domestic demand and output resulted in&#13;
larger investment in relatively capital-intensive sectors.&#13;
This section reappraises the patterns of primary factor use in view&#13;
of the sources of growth analysis discussed in Chapter 3.L'      In addition to&#13;
the decomposition of factor use, Chapter 4 considers the sources of sectoral&#13;
price changes and the effect of domestic price distortions on value added&#13;
growth rates. The results of these complementary analyses suggest areas for&#13;
further multi-sectoral research on the role of relative prices in income&#13;
determination and resource allocation.&#13;
A. Historical Patterns of Employment and Productivity Growth&#13;
Tables 4.1 to 4.3 present data for a brief analysis of the&#13;
historical trends of labor supply and demand and productivity changes.      The&#13;
labor and productivity figures assembled in these tables were derived from&#13;
various sources of data on the economically active population.        The labor&#13;
supply and demand totals given in Table 4.1 are largely based on the official&#13;
1/ Because of the paucity of data for the earlier periods, the sources of&#13;
changes in factor use (i.e., employment and investment requirements) have&#13;
been estimated only for 1963-73.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Third Plan (1973-77) estimates for the earlier periods.1/&#13;
The patterns of population, labor supply and employment during 1950-&#13;
73 are shown in Table 4.1.    The consequences of rapid population growth are&#13;
evident in the increasling values of dependency ratios, and in the growing&#13;
volumes of surplus labor, despite the massive migration of Turkish workers to&#13;
the  labor-importing   countries   of  Western   Europe.2/     Rapid  rates   of&#13;
urbanization have added to these difficulties by creating increasingly serious&#13;
unemployment   problems  in   the  urban  areas.     The   lack  of   employment&#13;
opportunities, increased education, and reduced female participation in the&#13;
rural  areas  have   been  instrumental  in   the  steady  decline  of  overall&#13;
participation ratios, which is indicated in Table 4.1-3/&#13;
The limited contribution made by the manufacturing sector to the&#13;
solution of unemployment problems in the urban areas is another notable&#13;
feature  of  the   observed  labor  supply  and   demand  patterns.    This   is&#13;
particularly striking in 1963-73, during which the service sectors contributed&#13;
56 per cent of the rise in total nonagricultural employment (excluding&#13;
unspecified   categories),   while   the  incremental   contributions   of   the&#13;
manufacturing and social overhead sectors were around 25 and 18 per cent,&#13;
1/ The official Fourth Plan (1979-83) gives somewhat revised estimates for&#13;
the labor supply and demand totals in the earlier periods. In the revised&#13;
time series, the total labor supply and agricultural employment figures&#13;
are adjusted upwards.    The historical data on employment in major non-&#13;
agricultural sectors are nearly the same in the Third and Fourth Plan&#13;
documents. See SPO (1973, Table 63) and SPO (1979, Table 20).&#13;
2/ For a detailed analysis of labor surplus in agriculture, see Hamurdan&#13;
(1970). The author's estimate for the 1973 cumulative foreign demand for&#13;
Turkish labor is within the range of the estimates of TUSIAD (1976) and&#13;
TSKB (1977), which are 646,000 and 785,000, respectively.&#13;
3/ See Yalcintas (1970), World Bank (1974) and World Bank (1980) for critical&#13;
evaluations of the manpower and employment perspectives set out in the&#13;
official development: plans. The determinants of the rates of urban&#13;
unemployment are examined by Celasun (1970).&#13;

respectively.   In the same period, the share of agricultural labor in total&#13;
civilian labor demand declined from 77 per cent in 1963 to 64 per cent in&#13;
1973, with continually large volumes of labor surplus prevailing in the rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
The changing patterns of employment status for the economically&#13;
active population are shown in Table 4.2 for the selected population census&#13;
years.J/ The figures indicate only marginal changes in employment status in&#13;
1950-60, with significant changes beginning to take place after 1960. In&#13;
employment status patterns, the predominance of non-employees (or non-wage&#13;
earners) engaged in agriculture and trade is important.     Large proportions of&#13;
the various non-employee categories are also observed in manufacturing,&#13;
transport and other services sectors.&#13;
Table 4.3 presents data on employment, net output (i.e., value&#13;
added) and productivity growth by major sectors in 1953-63 and 1963-73.&#13;
During both periods, total employment increased at an average rate of 1.3 per&#13;
cent per year (in contrast to 2.6 per cent annual increase in the 15-64 age&#13;
population). The overall productivity rise was somewhat faster in the 1963-73&#13;
period primarily due to notable productivity gains in the construction,&#13;
transportation   and   mining  sectors.      Considering  the   small   base  of&#13;
manufacturing employment in relation to agricultural labor, the employment&#13;
increases in this sector (41 percent in 1953-63 and 57 percent in 1963-73)&#13;

have not been sufficiently high to play a central role in the absorption of&#13;
the rapidly growing urban labor force.     The figures clearly point out the&#13;
stagnant nature of productivity changes in the service sector from 1963&#13;
onwards, which made labor absorption of such proportions possible.&#13;
The productivity indices estimated in Table 4.3 also show a slowdown&#13;
in the growth of labor productivity in manufacturing from 61 percent in 1953-&#13;
63 to 51 percent in 1963-73. The productivity growth rates for manufacturing&#13;
labor (in terms of value added per worker as defined in Table 4.3) were 27 and&#13;
19 percent during the 1963-68 and 1968-73 subperiods, respectively.      These&#13;
figures indicate the workings of a downward trend in the efficiency of labor&#13;
use in manufacturing, despite the increased capital intensity of industrial&#13;
investments (as shown in Table 4.7), and gradually reduced import rationing in&#13;
the  early  1970s, as discussed   earlier in Chapter 3.      The simultaneous&#13;
occurrence of increased capital-output ratios and decreased rates of labor&#13;
productivity growth in manufacturing points also to a deceleration in the rate&#13;
of total factor productivity growth (TFPG) in this sector from 1963-73.-'&#13;
B. Sources of Changes in Employment&#13;
The sources of changes in employment have been decomposed by the&#13;
share total method for 1963-68 and 1968-73 on the assumption that sectoral&#13;
labor demand is linked with sectoral gross output through a fixed coefficient&#13;
at a given time.   As a result, the decomposition of employment has generated&#13;
another factor (the change in labor coefficients) in addition to the four&#13;
1/ In a recent empirical study based on firm-level data, Krueger and Tuncer&#13;
(1980) also find a secular downward trend in TFPG in private sector&#13;
manufacturing in the 1963-76 period. For an earlier contribution on the&#13;
appraisal of labor productivity in Turkish manufacturing in the mid-1960s,&#13;
see Kazgan (1972).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
sources of growth identified in the decomposition of gross output, as&#13;
discussed in the preceeding chapter.    (See Appendix 1.F for the decomposition&#13;
1/&#13;
formulas) 1&#13;
Total Employment&#13;
Table 4.4 gives the aggregate measures for the sources of growth and&#13;
structural change in employment at five-year intervals during 1963-73.       As&#13;
expected, the change in labor coefficients produced a large negative effect on&#13;
employment growth throughout the entire period. Technological change also had&#13;
a contractionary effect on aggregate employment primarily as a result of the&#13;
negative contribution of input-output coefficient changes to agricultural&#13;
expansion.     The   combined  negative   effects  of  changes   in  structural&#13;
coefficients were mainly offset by the pronounced positive effect of domestic&#13;
final demand expansion on employment increases. The observed relative&#13;
contributions of import substitution and export expansion to employment&#13;
generation over time closely correspond to the relative proportions of their&#13;
contribution to output growth, as described in Chapter 3.&#13;
To determine the employment generation potential of outward-oriented&#13;
growth  in   Turkey,  the  relative   sizes  of  domestic   and  export  demand&#13;
contributions to value added and employment growth were compared for 1963-&#13;
73.  While export and domestic demand expansion explained, respectively, 9 and&#13;
90 percent of the growth of value added, their contributions to increases in&#13;
1/ For the decomposition of employment,a detailed attempt was made by the&#13;
author to derive estimates for sectoral total labor (including wage&#13;
earners as well as workers in nonemployee status) at the 25 sector level&#13;

employment figures for major sectors were reconciled with the labor&#13;

overall employment were 40 and 277 percent.     These figures clearly show that&#13;
export effects (as opposed to domestic demand effects) had a greater impact on&#13;
increasing employment than the expansion of value added in 1963-73.         This&#13;
reflects the significant differences in the relative factor intensities of&#13;
export and domestic market-oriented production in the Turkish economy.&#13;
In contrast, the decomposition of structural change in employment&#13;
shows a different pattern. The deviation measures indicate that the changes in&#13;
labor and input-output coefficients account for 54 percent of the&#13;
compositional shifts in employment from 1963-73, whereas the relative&#13;
contribution of domestic demand effects was about 40 percent. However, export&#13;
effects on the structural change of labor demand remained unimportant during&#13;
1963-68 and 1968-73.&#13;
Sectoral Employment&#13;
Table 4.5 presents sectoral estimates for the sources of employment&#13;
growth, which were calculated as the chained first difference measures for&#13;
1963-73. Employment change figures in this table show that total employment&#13;
increased by about 1.6 million in 1963-73, despite the large decrease (of 0.5&#13;
million) in agricultural employment. The changes in labor and input-output&#13;
coefficients were the primary reasons for the decline of agricultural&#13;
employment.    They were not balanced by      the positive effects    of demand&#13;
expansion.    Approximately   56  percent  of  the  growth  in  nonagricultural&#13;
employment occurred   In services.    This sector experienced stagnant labor&#13;
productivity growth, as reflected in the small negative employment effect of&#13;
changes in labor coefficients.    Employment expansion in social overhead was&#13;
also substantial, in spite of the large negative effect caused by changes in&#13;
labor coefficients (mainly reflecting productivity gains in transportation).&#13;
In the latter sector, the employment contribution of domestic demand expansion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
was dominant.   Among the nonagricultural sectors, mining played a minor role&#13;
in employment expansion, partly due to the relatively rapid pace of growth in&#13;
its labor productivity.&#13;
The manufacturing sector as a whole provided 25 percent of increased&#13;
employment (about 2.1 million people) in nonagricultural sectors, despite the&#13;
negative employment effects of changes in labor coefficients in all its&#13;
branches (except basic metals). Domestic and export demand expansion explain,&#13;
respectively, 169 and 14 percent of the increase in manufacturing employment,&#13;
during 1963-73. However, these positive effects on manufac- turing employment&#13;
were largely offset by the negative employment impact (-110 percent) of&#13;
changes in labor coefficients.1/&#13;
The relative contribution of export expansion to employment growth&#13;
was less than 9 percent in all industries, except in food (32 percent),&#13;
textiles (25 percent), metal products (10 percent) and non-metallics (9&#13;
percent).   In contrast, the relative contribution of import substitution to&#13;
employment growth varied widely among the manufacturing industries.        The&#13;
asymmetrical effects of import substitution and technological change on&#13;
employment growth in the machinery and basic intermediate groups reflect the&#13;
same pattern discussed in the decomposition of production in Chapter 3.&#13;
The basic metals industry is the only example in which the change in&#13;
labor coefficients resulted in increased employment. This reflects the rapid&#13;
expansion of the labor force for this industry in the early 1970s for training&#13;
1/ During 1963-73,, nonagricultural employment in the Republic of Korea (with&#13;
a population smaller than Turkey) increased by about 2.8 million people,&#13;
and the incremental share of manufacturing was about 32 percent. In the&#13;
Korean case, the relative contributions of domestic demand, export&#13;
expansion and changes in labor coefficients to the growth of manufacturing&#13;
employment were 131, 113 and -137 percent, respectively. See Kim (1978).&#13;

steel works at Iskenderun, and the aluminum complex at Seydisehir).&#13;
The disaggregated estimates for the sources of employment growth&#13;
support the conclusions reached on the basis of aggregate measures.        The&#13;
results point to the potential role of exports in generating additional&#13;
employment mainly in agriculture, food processing and textiles, but also, to a&#13;
lesser extent, in non-metallics, metal products and social overhead.l/&#13;
C. Sources of Changes in Investment Requirements&#13;
The lack of coefficient data on capital stocks has precluded an&#13;
analysis of the sources of capital expansion along the lines of the&#13;
decomposition  of  employment, as discussed    above.2/    Instead, a method&#13;
developed by Watanabe (1975) in a sources of growth study on the Japanese&#13;
economy was adapted.3/     By using   the available   data on sectoral fixed&#13;
investments (by sector of destination), a sources of growth analysis has been&#13;
carried out for investments (i.e., the first differences in capital stocks)&#13;
rather than capital stocks in 1963-68 and 1968-73.   As a result, the analysis&#13;
focuses on the differences between the second period and first period&#13;
investments. The following two causes of the differences were considered: (1)&#13;
the differences in the final demand expansions in the two consecutive periods;&#13;
and (2) the changes in production technologies (i.e., changes in incremental&#13;
1/ Turkey's comparative advantage in these sectors has been further&#13;
strengthened by the rapidly expanding import requirements of the oil-&#13;
surplus countries in the Middle East.&#13;
2/ For public and private large-scale manufacturing (exluding small firms),&#13;
Ebiri et al (1977) provide annual capital stock estimates for 15&#13;
subsectors over 1965-75.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
input-output and capital-output coefficients).l/&#13;
The numerical results of the investment growth analysis are&#13;
summarized at the 9 sector level of aggregation, as shown in Table 4.6.&#13;
According to the taible, the part of the investment increase attributed to&#13;
changes in production technologies was larger than the part attributed to the&#13;
expansion of final demand in all major sectors, except in food, textiles and&#13;
social overhead.   These results support the earlier conclusions that export-&#13;
oriented manufacturing subsectors (such as food and textiles) have adopted&#13;
relatively more labor-intensive production technologies, and contributed more&#13;
effectively to employment generation (and capital savings) in their expansion&#13;
process.&#13;
The negative signs of the investment increments resulting from&#13;
differences in final demand expansion during the two consecutive periods&#13;
reflect the following factors:&#13;
(1)  The   long   gestation  lags   and  indivisibilities   in  fixed&#13;
investments (e.g., in mining and basic intermediates);&#13;
(2) The sharp increases in machinery and intermediate goods imports&#13;
in 1968-73, which restricted the growth of final demand on a net basis;&#13;
(3) The compositional shifts in consumer demand, which resulted in a&#13;
smaller increase in the final demand for unprocesssed agricultural products;&#13;
and&#13;
(4) The variations in cyclical conditions causing changes in the&#13;
rates   of  capacity   utilization  (e.g.,   adverse  weather   conditions   for&#13;
agriculture in 1973).&#13;
These results also indicate the tenuous nature of medium-term input-output&#13;
projections which ignore gestation processes in capital formation and varying&#13;
1/ In this analysis, final demand is equal to domestic final demand plus ex-&#13;
ports minus imports (by sector of origin).&#13;

Table 4.7 presents complementary evidence on the variation of&#13;
relative factor intensities over time and by major sectors. Estimates for the&#13;
incremental capital-output and capital-labor ratios in 1963-68 and 1968-73&#13;
have been derived from the data base of this study, except for agriculture&#13;
(see footnote 2 on Table 4.7). The incremental coefficients shown in Table 4.7&#13;
indicate a trend in the increased capital intensity of fixed investments in&#13;
mining, manufacturing and social overhead during 1963-73.       This trend was&#13;
particularly apparent in the basic intermediates group, which includes highly&#13;
capital-intensive industries such as chemicals, basic metals and petroleum&#13;
refining. Incremental capital-output and capital-labor ratios for basic&#13;
intermediates were about twice as large in 1968-73 as in 1963-68; and they&#13;
were substantially higher than the overall averages calculated for the&#13;
manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, this group's share in total manufacturing&#13;
investments increased from 51 percent in 1963-68 to 57 percent in 1968-73.&#13;
The upward trend in the capital intensity of manufacturing from&#13;
1963-73 continued under the implementation of the Third Plan (1973-77) and was&#13;
assumed in the projections of the Fourth Plan (1979-83). However, these plans&#13;
did not adopt a selective investment strategy to optimize the choices on the&#13;
timing, size and combination of capacity expansions in this sector. Instead,&#13;
available investment resources were thinly spread over numerous industrial&#13;
projects in the mid- and late 1970s.    As a result, structural adjustment was&#13;
more difficult in the early 1980si/&#13;

planned under the Fourth Plan. An analysis of the optimal mix of import&#13;
substitution and export promotion investments in 1972-80 is provided in a&#13;

D. Sources of Changes in Relative Sectoral Prices&#13;
Relative price movements have not received sufficient attention in&#13;
the available empirical research on the Turkish economy.l/        The prolonged&#13;
protection of domestic industries discouraged active interest in the movements&#13;
of real incentives, product price differentials and relative factor prices&#13;
until the economic crisis emerged in the late 1970s. This analysis attempts&#13;
1/ The two notable exceptions are the empirical contributions of Krueger&#13;
(1974) and Dervis and Robinson (1978). While Krueger (1974) provides fully&#13;
documented estimates for the movements of effective exchange rates for a&#13;
wide range of commodities in 1950-70, Dervis and Robinson (1978) decompose&#13;
the factors that contributed to the drift in equilibrium exchange rates in&#13;
1973-78.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
to distinguish the causes of differential change in domestic product prices at&#13;
the 25 sector level during 1963-73.&#13;
The framework of analysis is an input-output price model adapted&#13;
from more general methodology developed by Watanabe (1975) for the analysis of&#13;
price changes in Japan. In the tradition of the CSW models, the price analysis&#13;
takes a norm growth rate for the price increases, calculates deviations of the&#13;
observed sectoral prices from the norm price path, and finally attributes&#13;
these deviations to changes in: (1) the input-output structure; (2) labor&#13;
productivity; (3) real wages; and (4) residual factors, such as rents, profits&#13;
and indirect taxes (see Appendix 1.G).    If capital stock and profit data were&#13;
available, a more disaggregated analysis of the residual factors would be&#13;
possible.&#13;
For Turkey's price model, the rate of increase in the GDP deflator&#13;
has been adopted as the norm growth rate for sectoral producer prices in 1963-&#13;
68 and 1968-73.    Table 4.8 presents the combined results for 1963-73.       In&#13;
order to circumvent the complex problem of imputing wages to workers having&#13;
non-employee status, the price model was solved by using data on sectoral&#13;
employment and wages for those having employee status.        Consequently, the&#13;
residual factors incorporated the earnings of self-employed workers, which&#13;
were particularly important in the agriculture, livestock, trade and other&#13;
services sectors.&#13;
Movements in product prices during 1963-73 were dominated by the&#13;
more pronounced price changes in 1968-73, which somewhat shifted the domestic&#13;
terms of trade in favor of the agriculture and livestock sectors. The price&#13;
rises in agriculture partly reflected the effect of the general rise in the&#13;
world prices of primary commodities in 1972-73.         They were also due to&#13;
agricultural price policies which were less restrictive after 1968.          The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
upward trend in real agricultural prices decelerated in 1973-78, and was&#13;
eventually reversed in 1978-80 by the sharper rise of nonagricultural product&#13;
prices (especially in the energy and chemicals sectors), according to the new&#13;
Wholesale Price Index (of the Ministry of Commerce).&#13;
Table 4.8 shows that prices in wood products (including furniture),&#13;
basic metals, machinery, transport equipment and services (except trade and&#13;
dwellings) had also increased at a faster rate than the general price level,&#13;
while prices in mining and most manufacturing industries showed a relative&#13;
decline.   In sectors with positive price deviations (except basic metals and&#13;
machinery), positive signs for deviations for residual value added components&#13;
(including profits) resulted.    The most pronounced were in livestock, wood&#13;
products, transport equipment and other service sectors (which include&#13;
commercial banks and other financial institutions).&#13;
Moreover, the decomposition of price changes indicates two&#13;
additional factors in price formation.    First, the positive price deviations&#13;
caused by wage increases were offset in varying proportions by labor&#13;
productivity gains in all sectors (except public services).       The principal&#13;
sectors in which labor productivity gains could not adequately compensate for&#13;
wage increases were electricity, coal mining and basic metals, in which the&#13;
shares of state enterprises in total production were predominant.       Second,&#13;
changes in input-output coefficients produced positive deviations in sectoral&#13;
prices, with few exceptions. This means that technological change, which was&#13;
shown to be a significant source of structural change in output (see Chapter&#13;
3), tended to exert upward pressure on the real cost of production in most&#13;
manufacturing subsectors, with pronounced effects in machinery and related&#13;
branches.&#13;

Furthermore, the price changes due to deviations in wages largely&#13;
reflect the   shifts  in  intersectoral wage differentials    over  time.    As&#13;
reflected in Tables 4.9 and 4.10, manufacturing wages have increased&#13;
significantly in 1963-73 relative to wages in construction, other mining,&#13;
public services, trade and other services.    This is partly the result of the&#13;
growing influence of labor unions in wage determination under the umbrella of&#13;
restrictive trade policies pursued in the 1960s.      Within the manufacturing&#13;
sector proper, wage differentials among the subsectors remained large&#13;
throughout the period.    The overall pattern was that the wages in labor-&#13;
intensive branches (e.g., food, textiles, wood products, plastics, leather and&#13;
non-metallics) generally lagged behind the wages in capital-intensive ones&#13;
(e.g., petroleum products, basic metals, chemicals).    The wage differentials&#13;
within manufacturing were in varying degrees due to differences in relative&#13;
factor  intensities,   labor skills,  levels of protection,   unionization  and&#13;
degree  of monopoly power in the domestic markets.1/         In addition, the&#13;
manufacturing subsectors which lagged behind the others in relative wage&#13;
levels were also the ones which experienced significant effects of export&#13;
expansion on their growth. (See Table 3.9.)&#13;
In the transition towards more trade-oriented growth in Turkey, the&#13;
gradually reduced levels of protection and incentives for domestic market-&#13;
oriented industries will generate important shifts in sectoral prices,&#13;
relative wages and profits.   Thus, the type of price analysis presented here&#13;
merits continuing research in the future with an extended data base covering&#13;
sectoral capital stocks and profit ratios.&#13;

E. Domestic Price Distortions, Labor Reallocation and Value Added Growth Rates&#13;
An appraisal of employment changes in Turkey would be incomplete&#13;
without considering the impact of labor reallocation on the overall growth&#13;
process.    Viewed from the supply    side,  the movement of labor from low&#13;
productivity agriculture to high productivity nonagricultural sectors has been&#13;
an important source of value added growth in the country.         The sectoral&#13;
reallocation of labor itl Turkey has been particularly significant because of&#13;
the unusually large differences between the productivity levels of the&#13;
agricultural and nonagricultural sectors.   The cross-country average for the&#13;
ratio of value added per labor unit in nonagricultural sectors to that in&#13;
agriculture is estimated as 2.37 in Kuznets (1969), while the actual Turkish&#13;
data shows the ratio to be 4 to 5 in 1953-78.&#13;
The deviations of Turkey's sectoral productivity differentials from&#13;
Kuznets' cross-country norms are substantial, and are usually attributed to&#13;
domestic price distortions arising from the protection-cum-subsidy system.&#13;
Although the low crop yields observed in cereal farming may partly account for&#13;
the depressed levels of labor productivity in Turkish agriculture, overvalued&#13;
factor returns and incomes in nonagricultural sectors have been indicated by&#13;
unusually large sectoral productivity differentials in the past.&#13;
Some of the broad policy issues connected with overvalued non-&#13;
agricultural incomes in Turkey were first addressed by Hatiboglu (1978) in an&#13;
an attempt to estimate the proportion of the "rent element' in non-&#13;
agricultural value added.    Hatiboglu deducts the following from the actual&#13;
value added created by newly employed workers in non agricultural sectors: (1)&#13;
the hypothetical (or normal) payments to capital and (2) the amount of value&#13;
added if these workers were employed in agriculture.     This approach entails&#13;
numerous measurement difficulties, but it can be used to calculate reasonable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
estimates for the overstated part of intersectoral productivity differences&#13;
over time.&#13;
In a more recent analysis of the Turkish economy by Balassa (1979),&#13;
estimates are also derived for the effects of labor reallocation and relative&#13;
price distortions on overall labor productivity growth (referred to as overall&#13;
productivity   growth  or   OPG)  during   1967-77.     Balassa  calculates   the&#13;
hypothetical rate (2.7 percent a year) of OPG based on the assumption of the&#13;
constant sectoral composition of the labor force between 1967 and 1977, and&#13;
compares it to the actual rate (4.9 percent a year) of OPG. He attributes the&#13;
difference (2.2 percent a year) to the impact of labor reallocation (among&#13;
agriculture, industry and services) under the unadjusted relative prices of&#13;
this period. The effect of relative price distortions on OPG is estimated by&#13;
recalculating the sectoral composition of Turkish aggregate value added in&#13;
1967 in terms of price-corrected productivity differentials, and by applying&#13;
actual rates of sectoral labor productivity growth to the adjusted base-year&#13;
figures  in  1967-77.     With  the  base-year   productivity  figures   adjusted&#13;
according to Kuznets' cross-country standards, the results indicate a 4.1&#13;
percent increase in OPG annually as compared to the actual rate of 4.9&#13;
percent.i'&#13;
In the context of this study, which has focused on demand-related&#13;
determinants of growth and structural change, the effects of domestic price&#13;
distortions and labor reallocation on value added growth rates are of further&#13;
interest for the following three reasons; (1) to determine whether the effects&#13;
1/ The estimated rates of increase in total employment in 1967-77 are 21.8&#13;
and 11.2 percent in Balassa (1979) and the official Fourth Plan (SPO&#13;
1979), respectively. The data base of the present study indicates a 10.7&#13;
percent rise in total employment between our benchmark years 1968 and&#13;
1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
of price distortions on aggregate growth closely match the time pattern of&#13;
import substitution effects estimated in the decomposition of output changes;&#13;
(2) to determine the relative sizes of labor reallocation and price distortion&#13;
effects in the growth process in order to develop a realistic perspective on&#13;
the potential sources of future trade-oriented income growth as rates of&#13;
protection for nonagricultural activities decline; and (3) to reassess the&#13;
effects of price distortions on value added growth in reference to the cross-&#13;
country norms estimatedl for Turkey in Chapter 2. Based on the regressions of&#13;
Chenery and Syrquin (1975), these norms allow for shifts in population and&#13;
income level over time., Furthermore, they reflect the more recent experience&#13;
of a larger number of countries, as compared to the average patterns estimated&#13;
in Kuznets (1969) on the basis of less information.&#13;
The relative effects of labor reallocation and price distortions on&#13;
the growth of overall labor productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) in&#13;
19 53-78 have been estimated by employing the general approach used in Balassa&#13;
(1979). Because separate sectoral estimates for agriculture are not available&#13;
in the Chenery-Syrquin regressions, the economy has been broken down into&#13;
primary (i.e., agriculture and mining) and non-primary sectors, with all&#13;
relevant figures arranged accordingly .1      As a point of departure in the&#13;
analysis, the following estimates have been derived for the labor productivity&#13;
ratios in non-primary and primary comparisons at given points in time during&#13;
1953-78:&#13;
1/ The share of mining in primary value added was on the average less than 5&#13;
percent in 1953-73.   Hence, the conclusions drawn for the primary sector&#13;
pertain essentially to agriculture in the Turkish context.&#13;

Value added growth is expressed as a product of employment growth&#13;
and  labor productivity   growth under three    different sets of assumptions&#13;
(referred to as Cases I,II and III).       In each case, the growth of total&#13;
employment and the sectoral growth of labor productivity are the actual rates&#13;
for a given period.    In Cases I and II, the base year GDP is given, but its&#13;
sectoral breakdown is adjusted in order to produce the norm productivity&#13;
differential estimated from the Chenery-Syrquin cross-country patterns.       In&#13;
Case I, the sectoral composition of employment is assumed to remain constant&#13;
between  the endpoints of each subperiod, while in Case II the sectoral&#13;
employment growth rates are the same as the actual rates.      Because Case III&#13;
represents the actual situation, there      is no adjustment in the observed&#13;
figures.&#13;
The results of the calculations for each subperiod are presented in&#13;
index form in Table 4.11.      The estimates derived for the growth rates of&#13;
overall labor productivity and GDP provide a basis to separate the relative&#13;
effects of labor reallocation and price distortions in the observed growth&#13;
process. In terms of compound annual growth rates (in annual percentage),&#13;
overall labor productivity growth (OPG) can be expressed (in rounded figures)&#13;
as follows:&#13;
1/ The predicted productivity ratios have been estimated from the cross-&#13;
country norms for the shares of the primary and non-primary sectors in&#13;
total employment and value added, as reported in Chapter 2 (Tables 2.1 and&#13;
2).&#13;

The above estimates show that the impact of labor reallocation on&#13;
price-adjusted OPG was very low in 1953-63, but increased sharply in 1963-68.&#13;
This reflects the most rapid expansion of non-primary employment in this&#13;
subperiod, due to slow, labor productivity growth in the non-primary sector.&#13;
In 1968-73 and 1973-78, the relative proportion of the reallocation effect in&#13;
OPG steadily declined.   This was due to a less pronounced rise in non-primary&#13;
employment, as well as to strong labor productivity growth in the primary&#13;
sector during the last subperiod.    The effects of price distortions over time&#13;
roughly follow the pattern of labor reallocation effects, although they show a&#13;
sharp decline in 1973-78.&#13;
GDP (total value added) has been decomposed according to the effects&#13;
of the following four factors: (1) total employment; (2) price-adjusted OPG&#13;
(excluding the impact of labor reallocation); (3) improvement in price-&#13;
adjusted OPG due to labor reallocation; and (4) price distortions. The&#13;
relative shares of these four effects in GDP growth have been calculated by&#13;
the logarithmic decomposition scheme.    Table 4.12 shows the percentages for&#13;
the subperiods and the chained results for 1953-78.&#13;
Because the employment series is statistically unreliable, the&#13;
estimated sizes of the relative contributions of labor reallocation and price&#13;
distortions to the growth of GDP are subject to certain margins of error.&#13;

However, the interperiod variations in the effects of these two factors are&#13;
significant, and are unlikely to change if employment figures are modified.&#13;
As expected, the overstatement of the observed GDP growth rate due to&#13;
distortions in relative prices was most pronounced in 1963-68.     The relative&#13;
contribution of import substitution to the growth of output was also highest&#13;
during this time, as noted in Chapter 3Â±'&#13;
1/  See the first difference measures in Tables 3.5a and 3.6.        In Krueger&#13;
(1974), the annual rate of growth of manufacturing value added during&#13;
1967-72 was estimated as 11.1 and 10.3 in domestic and world prices,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
The relative size of the price distortion effect somewhat declined&#13;
in 1968-73, when a semi-open trade strategy was pursued and agricultural&#13;
prices were allowed to increase faster than the general price level.        The&#13;
latter trend continued in 1973-78.       Because of the government's subsidy&#13;
policies, the terms of trade for agriculture did not deteriorate despite the&#13;
sharp rise in world fertilizer prices. Rapid reserve decumulation and heavy&#13;
borrowing led to the continued real increase of imports in 1973-77, and caused&#13;
a further decline in the premium of industrial imports until the emergence of&#13;
payments difficulties in mid-1977.&#13;
The relative impact of labor reallocation on observed GDP growth was&#13;
also substantial in 1963-68.      It shows a time pattern that approximates&#13;
(although at different orders of magnitude) the interperiod differences in the&#13;
effect of price distortions in 1963-78.      However, the trends indicated by&#13;
calculation of the Chenery-Syrquin cross-country norms for labor use suggest&#13;
that a further restructuring of the labor force is very likely in the future&#13;
transitional process.   (See Table 2.2.)    Consequently,  the reallocation of&#13;
labor should be expected to continue having an impact (albeit more moderate)&#13;
on the future growth of GDP, even after relative price distortions disappear.&#13;
The chained results for the entire period, when Turkey's real GDP&#13;
increased over four-fold, suggest that approximately 10 percent of the growth&#13;
is overstated because of the effect of domestic price distortions, which are&#13;
measured   in  terms   of  deviations   from  the   intersectoral  productivity&#13;
differentials inferred from the cross-country structural norms of Chenery and&#13;
Syrquin (1975).l/    The estimated price distortion effect on observed GDP&#13;
growth is very significant, and suggests that overvalued factor returns and&#13;

GDP growth are 11.8 and 14.3 percent in 1953-73 and 1963-73, respectively.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
incomes exist in the non-primary part of the economy.         As a result, the&#13;
gradual removal of domestic price distortions and the transition toward trade-&#13;
oriented growth imply a slowdown in the rise of average real incomes of non-&#13;
primary producers and workers in the adjustment period."1        Given the low&#13;
savings propensities of income groups in the primary sector, the changes in&#13;
the structure of real incomes could have serious consequences not only for&#13;
income distribution, but also for the processes of resources mobilization.&#13;
Finally, the downward trend in the relative contribution of&#13;
employment to overall value added growth in 1953-78 (as shown in Table 4.12)&#13;
indicates the scope and need for larger employment effects in the growth&#13;
process of the 1980s.    Because of the growing labor surplus in the country,&#13;
the generation of productive employment in an increasingly less protected and&#13;
more outward-oriented economy will clearly require more attention in policy&#13;
planning and project studies.&#13;
1/ The length of the adjustment period may be shortened by a vigorous drive&#13;
to accelerate total factor productivity growth In the economy.&#13;

5. STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR&#13;
This section provides a closer look at the structural transformation&#13;
of Turkish manufacturing compared with the cross-country average patterns in&#13;
1953-78,  and  public  and  private  shares  in  1953-73.    In addition,   the&#13;
interindustry pattern of protection that prevailed in the late 1960s is&#13;
briefly discussed. Chapter 5 complements the sources of growth analysis, and&#13;
serves as a background for the discussion of the basic causes of limited trade&#13;
effects in Turkish industrialization in Chapter 6.&#13;
A. Actual and Predicted Patterns in Manufacturing Output&#13;
As discussed in Chapter 2, the comparison of Turkey's observed&#13;
structural characteristics with those predicted for a country of its size and&#13;
income level reveals that the actual shares of industrial output, exports and&#13;
employment in their respective totals generally lag behind the cross-country&#13;
norms, although a substantial catching-up effort took place in 1963-78.&#13;
Table 5.1 contrasts Turkey's manufacturing structure with the large&#13;
country (L) patterns predicted by the cross-country regressions of Chenery and&#13;
Taylor (1968).    The latter study shows that the manufacturing development&#13;
pattern for large countries (with populations above 15 million) is primarily&#13;
determined by the changing composition of domestic demand with rising income,&#13;
and that the effects of trade differences are relatively unimportant.       The&#13;
individual industries are then described as "early," "middle" or 'late" on the&#13;
basis of the timing of their essential growth in the process of&#13;
industrialization.   In the Chenery-Taylor cross-section patterns for large&#13;
countries, "early" industries (such as food and textiles) contribute the most&#13;
to growth when an economy's per capita income level is below $ 200; while&#13;
"middle" industries (such as chemicals, petroleum refining, non-metallic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
minerals, rubber and wood products) contribute about 40 percent of the&#13;
increase in industrial share at levels between $ 100 and $ 400 (in constant&#13;
1960 U.S. dollars). "Late" industries (such as basic metals, machinery, paper&#13;
and printing) mainly have an impact above the $ 300 level, which Chenery-&#13;
Taylor consider the mid-point     in the industrialization process.      In the&#13;
calculation of the predicted shares for Turkey, per capita income levels for&#13;
the benchmark years 1953, 1963, 1973 and 1978 have been estimated as $ 176, $&#13;
216, $ 318 and $ 382, respectively, in 1960 U.S. dollars.L/&#13;
The non-uniform deviation of domestic prices from world prices in&#13;
various Turkish manufacturing industries may effect the comparison of actual&#13;
and  predicted   shares.    The  comparatively   larger  domestic  world  price&#13;
differentials in metal fabricating and intermediate goods production probably&#13;
lead to an overstatement of the transition from light to heavy industries in&#13;
Turkey.   (See, e.g., the nominal and effective rates of protection estimated&#13;
for 1968 in Table 4.4.)    Consequently, the changes observed in actual shares&#13;
(based on value added figures measured in current producer prices) should be&#13;
interpreted broadly in qualitative terms.2/&#13;
1/  The Chenery and Taylor regression equations for subsector shares have the&#13;
following form:&#13;
Xi - a + B1 ln Y +   02(ln y) +   ylnN + celn ep + e2ln cm&#13;
where Xi - value added per capita in sector;&#13;
y - per capita GNP (in 1960 dollars) at factor cost&#13;
N - population in millions&#13;
ep- share of primary exports in GNP&#13;
em   share of manufactured exports in GNP&#13;
Remarks:  (i)  e   and em are predicted values from the large country&#13;
regressions; and a, Pl, 02* Y, el and e2 are estimated coefficients.&#13;
(ii) The vaLues of y are initially estimated in 1964 dollars&#13;
(see footnote 2, Chapter 2; and Table 1.1), and subsequently switched to 1960&#13;
dollars using the US Wholesale Price Index.&#13;
2/ The actual value added shares expressed in terms of current douestic&#13;
factor cost result in somewhat smaller shares for basic and light&#13;
intermediates, and larger shares for machinery and related industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
According to Table 5.1, in 1953 Turkey lagged substantially behind&#13;
the cross-country norms in all intermediate goods industries, while exceeding&#13;
the norms in food, textile, and machinery and allied industries. In 1963, the&#13;
actual shares of textiles, basic intermediates and machinery sectors were&#13;
comparable to the typical large country averages, with food processing&#13;
surpassing the norms and light intermediates (particularly wood and paper&#13;
products) falling markedly below the predicted proportions. The observed&#13;
transition from 1963 to 1973 is more striking, with a pronounced fall in the&#13;
share of food processing; a significant rise in the share of machinery and&#13;
transport equipment industries; and gradual improvements in the shares of the&#13;
light and basic intermediate goods industries.&#13;
The establishment of new branches specializing in consumer durables&#13;
production (including passenger cars) is the main factor behind the&#13;
particularly large share of industries grouped under the heading of machinery&#13;
production in 1973 and 1978. The latter were basically in the form of assembly&#13;
operations heavily dependent on the imports of parts and components at&#13;
concessional tariffs.   However, their final products were strongly protected&#13;
by high tariff walls and quantitative restrictions. The actual shares in 1978&#13;
were strongly affected by the cyclical position of the economy, which was&#13;
weakened by severe shortages of oil and non-oil imports and output disruptions&#13;
in the chemicals and petroleum refining subsectors.&#13;
Using the cross-country framework developed by Chenery and Taylor&#13;
(1968) as a basis, the characteristics of the transformation of Turkish&#13;
manufacturing in 1953-78 may be summarized as follows:&#13;
(1) The transition within Turkish manufacturing closely follows the&#13;
structural pattern predicted for a country of Turkey's size and income level&#13;
in 1953-73.   Primarily in response to the changing composition of domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
demand as income levels rose, the structure of manufacturing output shifted to&#13;
'middle" and "late" industries as predicted by the relevant cross-country&#13;
regressions.    Changes  in input-output relations    tended to reinforce the&#13;
effects of domestic final demand on Turkish industrialization according to the&#13;
typical large country pattern.&#13;
(2) Despite the rapid decline in the relative share of food&#13;
processing after 1963, the actual share of this industry has been somewhat&#13;
higher than its predicted share in 1963-78.     This situation partly reflects&#13;
the export expansion effects on the growth of food processing, as described&#13;
for later periods in the previous section.       In turn, a comparison of the&#13;
actual and predicted shares of the textiles and leather industry shows that&#13;
export effects have not been sufficient to change its relative position in the&#13;
manufacturing structure of a large country such as Turkey.&#13;
(3) Although the rapid increases in the actual shares of "late"&#13;
industries such as basic metals, machinery and transport equipment are partly&#13;
due to the effects of domestic price distortions, they also indicate very high&#13;
income elasticities in these industries (more than 2, as shown in Section 3.E,&#13;
compared to the cross-section pool elasticity of 1.75 in Chenery and Taylor&#13;
(1968, footnote 37)).    As a result, the moderation of domestic final demand&#13;
growth in the 1980s plusi the gradual removal of price distortions may reduce&#13;
the  shares  of these industries    in  the immediate   future.   Whether such&#13;
reductions can be offset by export expansion cannot be determined on the basis&#13;
of our interindustry data, and needs to be analyzed in a more disaggregated&#13;
framework.&#13;
(4) Finally, the comparison of the actual and predicted shares of&#13;
certain "middle" industries, such as petroleum refining and non-metallic&#13;
products, shows a considerable catching-up effort with the cross-country norms&#13;

in 1953-63, but relatively more moderate expansion after 1963.     However, the&#13;
comparative figures in Table 5.1 also indicate that significant time lags&#13;
occurred in the introduction and/or expansion of other "middle' industries,&#13;
such as paper, printing and rubber products. The relatively small proportions&#13;
of output in total manufacturing for a number of "middle" industries poses a&#13;
resource allocation problem, as a result of the highly capital-intensive&#13;
nature of their fixed investments (illustrated by Table 4.7).      Yet, despite&#13;
their rapidly expanded shares in manufacturing fixed investment, basic&#13;
intermediate industries have contributed inadequately to import substitution&#13;
and employment creation, as shown in Chapters 3 and 4.        These two related&#13;
problems are briefly considered below in terms of public and private sector&#13;
shares.&#13;
B. Patterns of Public and Private Sector Shares in Turkish Manufacturing&#13;
In Turkey's recent economic history, public enterprises have played&#13;
a significant role in the growth and structural change of the manufacturing&#13;
sector.   Established in the 1930s as a temporary institutional vehicle for&#13;
industrial growth, the public enterprise sector has, nevertheless, become&#13;
firmly entrenched in the national economy, and it serves a variety of economic&#13;
and non-economic objectives pursued by the government.    As analyzed in detail&#13;
elsewhere (Walstedt, 1980), because public and private enterprises in Turkish&#13;
manufacturing have never been sufficiently integrated under common rules of&#13;
pricing and allocation in the factor and product markets, there is a deeply&#13;
rooted dualism in the country's industrial development.&#13;
Tables 5.2 and 5.3 present the estimated relative shares of the&#13;
public and private sectors in manufacturing value added and investments,&#13;
respectively, at approximately the same level of disaggregation discussed in&#13;
&#13;

Chapter 3_1/&#13;
The most significant trends in the evolving patterns of public and&#13;
private ownership in manufacturing are the following:2/&#13;
(1) From 1953-63, the private share in total manufacturing value&#13;
added increased sharply due to the rapid expansion of private output in&#13;
textiles, machinery (particularly metal products, agricultural equipment and&#13;
vehicle assembly), petroleum products (mainly due to foreign private capital)&#13;
and, to a minor extent, in the basic metals industry. Within the machinery&#13;
group, the expansion of the relative share of large companies was very&#13;
significant. In chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals) and non-metallics, a shift&#13;
from small to larger firms was also apparent, while the private shares&#13;
declined. Public shares increased in chemicals, non-metallics (e.g., cement),&#13;
sugar (in food processing), and wood products, but decreased substantially in&#13;
textiles and machinery.&#13;
Both the disaggregated estimates of the sources of growth (shown in&#13;
Table 3.9) and the share figures indicate that the growth of the private&#13;
manufacturing industry in 1953-63 was very rapid, and that it benefited from&#13;
the contributions of import substitution in the machinery, textiles and rubber&#13;
products branches. During this time, an urban entrepreneurial class emerged,&#13;
and it played an increasing active political as well as economic role in the&#13;
1/ Because of the numerous organizational forms for public enterprises, and&#13;
their extensive participation in the private sector, there are no fixed&#13;
rules to partition industrial output between private and public shares.&#13;
While Table 5.2 adheres to the practice of the SIS in reporting sectoral&#13;
shares, Table 5.3 uses the SPO data sources, adjusted for consistency with&#13;
Table 5.2 in the treatment of the basic metals subsector.      (The Erdemir&#13;
steel complex is included in the public sector, although it is nominally a&#13;
private enterprise, because it was established primarily with government&#13;
capital).&#13;

industrial structures within the framework of Turkish I-0 tables.&#13;

subsequent periods.    The private sector initiatives in the 1950s received&#13;
substantial support from the newly established institutions, such as the&#13;
Turkish Industrial Development Bank (funded by the World Bank), and benefited&#13;
from the government's ad hoc protection and subsidy measures.&#13;
(2) From 1963-73, policy interest in public enterprises as a vehicle&#13;
of industrial growth resumed, particularly in capital-intensive intermediate&#13;
goods industries.    The relative scope of the private sector was increased&#13;
mainly in textiles, food processing, rubber products, chemicals (the less&#13;
capital-intensive categories), and machinery and related industries. In most&#13;
subsectors, the sustained rapid growth of private manufacturing value added&#13;
and investments was associated with shifts in the size of private&#13;
establishments.l/&#13;
(3) The sources of growth estimates discussed in Chapter 3 (Table&#13;
3.9), together with the value added shares shown in Table 4.2 suggest a&#13;
significant pattern. The growth of private manufacturing was more rapid for&#13;
subsectors in which domestic final demand expansion played an above average&#13;
role. Public shares typically increased in subsectors in which technological&#13;
change had a more than average effect on the growth process.          The public&#13;
sector mainly attempted to address the problem of catching-up with the cross-&#13;
country norms in the "middle" industries, which met the rising intermediate&#13;
demand in all major sectors of the economy.    In turn, export expansion effects&#13;
on the growth of food processing (involving lower stages of processing of&#13;
tobacco and dried fruits) largely occurred in public and semi-public units,&#13;
1/ Tekeli et al (1980) provide an extensive set of concentration measures for&#13;
Turkish manufacturing In 1971-77. In about 65 percent of 115 four-digit&#13;
private industries, the four-plant concentration ratio was above 50&#13;
percent (in terms of the sales value). Also, the concentration ratios and&#13;
intensity of electricity consumption together explain about 20 percent of&#13;
the variation In the price-cost margins at the four-digit industry level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
while the export-oriented side of production growth in textiles was achieved&#13;
almost entirely by private firms toward the end of the 1963-73 period.&#13;
(4) The structure of fixed investments in manufacturing underwent&#13;
sequential shifts in the two consecutive five-year periods from 1963-73. The&#13;
shares of both light and basic intermediates in total manufacturing&#13;
investments increased during the period.    The public sector took the lead in&#13;
paper, petroleum products, basic chemicals and metals. The investment shares&#13;
listed in Table 5.3 show the expanding scope of private fixed investments in&#13;
food processing (of non-monopoly goods), textiles, non-metallics, and&#13;
machinery and related industries (primarily consumer durables and vehicle&#13;
assembly plants).    The subsector shares of manufacturing fixed investments&#13;
achieved under the Third Plan (1973-77) and projected in the Fourth Plan&#13;
(1979-83) suggest that these trends continued after 1973. The basic inter-&#13;
mediates group is absorbing more than 50 percent of the total investable&#13;
resources in the manufacturing sector through the implementation of public&#13;
enterprise projects.&#13;
Table 5.4 provides 1968 data on the structure of protection&#13;
estimated by Olgun (1975).     In 1968 the economy was in a severely import-&#13;
constrained cyclical position, and comparisons of domestic and world prices&#13;
may be unreliable in some sectors (e.g., in agriculture and non-electrical&#13;
machinery, as noted by Olgun).&#13;
Nevertheless, the estimates indicate four salient characteristics of&#13;
the system of protection that prevailed in the 19609 and, to a considerable&#13;
extent, in the 1970s.    First, the system of protection involved significant&#13;
discrimination between the primary and manufacturing sectors, which had&#13;
effective protection averaging 197 and 314 percent, respectively. The effects&#13;
of relative price distortions resulting from such discrimination have been&#13;

analyzed in Chapter 4.E in the context of overstated value added growth rates.&#13;
Second, the escalation in protection for the subsectors from lower to higher&#13;
stages of fabrication was substantial, as noted in the cases of agriculture&#13;
and food processing, and basic metals and metal products.      Third, the wide&#13;
differences between nominal protection rates (based on price comparisons) and&#13;
nominal tariff rates (based on actual import taxes, not separately shown in&#13;
the table) reflected the presence of large import premia in all industries due&#13;
to quantitative import restrictions. Fourth, various export promotion schemes&#13;
did not remove the bias against exports, which is measured in Table 4.4 as the&#13;
percentage of excess value added realized in production for the domestic&#13;
market over value added generated in production for exports.         ThIus, the&#13;
protectionist system reinforced the effects of domestic demand expansion as a&#13;
source of growth in manufacturing in general, and in private-led machinery and&#13;
related industries in particular.&#13;
The ownership patterns in Turkish manufacturing concerning the&#13;
relative shares of firms with foreign partnership are shown in Table 5.5 for&#13;
1973&#142;11    The gross revenue and employment shares of firms with foreign&#13;
partnership were relatively high in those subsectors which had grown rapidly&#13;
in domestic market-oriented,   but import-dependent ways, as in the case of&#13;
vehicle assembly, electrical appliances, chemical and pharmaceuticals. Minor&#13;
exceptions were certain non-metallic (e.g., earthware) projects.        Foreign&#13;
private capital has also responded to the structure of incentives, which&#13;
favored inward-looking patterns of development, characterized by an increasing&#13;
dependence on imported current inputs.&#13;

The comparison of the actual shares of subsectors in total&#13;
manufacturing output with those predicted for a country of Turkey's&#13;
population, size and income level shows that the structural transition within&#13;
Turkish manufacturing has generally followed the pattern predicted for a&#13;
typical large country with a narrow trade orientation.        However,  in the&#13;
Turkish transitional effort, there were delays in catching up with the cross-&#13;

country norms for "middle" industries producing capital-intensive intermediate&#13;
products.  Analysis of the evolving patterns of public and private shares in&#13;
manufacturing reveals that the public sector has been essentially involved in&#13;
expanding domestic production of basic intermediates goods by undertaking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
highly capital-intensive investment projects, while private firms have been&#13;
mainly attracted to the development of industries in which domestic final&#13;
demand effects have been the principal source of growth.&#13;
Although the overall strategy of structural change in Turkish&#13;
manufacturing resembles the typical large country pattern predicted by cross-&#13;
country regressions, this analysis indicates two sets of problems at the&#13;
implementation and policy levels. The first is related to the steadily rising&#13;
capital intensity of public investments in basic intermediate goods&#13;
industries, which have absorbed a large proportion of available funds for&#13;
manufacturing development in the country.1/     To a considerable extent, the&#13;
unduly high capital-output ratios of public manufacturing investments reflect&#13;
inadequate planning at the project level, resulting in investable resources&#13;
thinly spread over a numerous ongoing projects.     The long gestation lags in&#13;
public manufacturing investments have sharply reduced their potential&#13;
contribution to the trade adjustment process in the mid- and late 1970s.&#13;
The second set of problems is connected with the protectionist&#13;
system, which featured an anti-export bias in the past, and provided greater&#13;
effective protection at higher stages of fabrication.      The consequence has&#13;
been the emergence of high-cost private firms that produce equivalent products&#13;
for the domestic market under different technological agreements, and that&#13;
exhibit no particular tendencies for the horizontal and/or vertical&#13;
specialization needed for trade-oriented sustainable growth in the 1980s.&#13;
These broad conclusions indicate the need for more detailed research on new&#13;
guidelines for future rationalization and restructuring of the Turkish&#13;
manufacturing sector.&#13;

6. TOWARD TRADE-ORIENTED GROWTH&#13;
AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE 1980s&#13;
The previous chapters have analyzed the sources of growth and&#13;
structural change in Turkey's recent economic history, and evaluated them in&#13;
the context of the average country patterns. Internal factors (domestic final&#13;
demand and technological change) have been shown to account for about 85&#13;
percent of the shifts in the productive structure during 1953-73.        Export&#13;
expansion and import substitution in varying proportions were the remaining&#13;
factors. While export effects on growth and structural change became somewhat&#13;
more pronounced in 1968-73, import substitution effects were more important in&#13;
1953-68, but showed a sharp decline in the early 1970s.&#13;
After the 'easier" stage of import substitution was completed by the&#13;
end of the 1960s, the import intensity of intermediate inputs steadily&#13;
increased in the 1970s (notwithstanding the shift in fixed investments toward&#13;
heavy industry).    Along with stagnant export growth, it contributed to the&#13;
massive external imbalance in the economy.l/     As a result, the narrow trade&#13;
orientation in Turkey"s transitional effort could no longer be sustained in&#13;
the aftermath of the external shocks of the mid-1970s.      This paper finally&#13;
discusses the major causes of limited trade effects observed in Turkish&#13;
industrialization, and considers the prospects for transition toward       more&#13;
outward orientation in the 1980s.&#13;
A. Trade Effects on Turkish Industrialization&#13;
The principal factors that limited the trade orientation of Turkish&#13;
industrialization after 1950 are broadly reviewed in terms of the country's&#13;
1/ See Balassa (1981),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
size and natural endowments, institutional conditions, and economic policies.&#13;
(1) Large Country Characteristics and Natural Endowments&#13;
Chenery's empirically based cross-country comparisons show that the&#13;
sources of growth In large countries (i.e., a population over 15 million in&#13;
1960) differ from the average pattern in that the effects of domestic final&#13;
demand and technological change are more pronounced in aln major sectors. l/&#13;
In a typical large country, greater internal demand, relatively more diverse&#13;
natural resources, and higher internal transport costs induce an essentially&#13;
domestic market-or-iented growth process, with exports accounting for only 15&#13;
percent of the (gross) output change in manufacturing at the Turkish income&#13;
levels observed in 1953-73.&#13;
The Turkish situation nearly represents the extreme case of a semi-&#13;
closed (rather than a typical) large country identified in Chenery's cross-&#13;
section analysis. This study has shown that export expansion as a source of&#13;
growth contributed about 2.3 and 8.2 percent to the manufacturing output&#13;
increases  in   1953-63  and  1963-73,  respectively.     In  addition,  import&#13;
substitution lost its relative importance after contributing significantly in&#13;
the  earlier  periods  of  industrialization.     The  timing  of allocational&#13;
adjustments toward export expansion in general, and promotion of industrial&#13;
exports in particular has lagged far behind the normal transition expected for&#13;
a country of Turkey's size and income level during the past two decades.&#13;
The delayed shift toward normal export orientation may be partly&#13;
explained by the natural resource endowment of the country.         In certain&#13;
countries which experienced export-led industrialization (such as Japan and&#13;
Korea), natural resource limitations restricted output expansion in the&#13;
1/ See Chanery (1979, Chapter 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
primary sectors, necessitated substantial primary imports, and thereby&#13;
fostered the attitude that exports were essential for survival and sustained&#13;
economic growth.     Industrial policies were framed in this atmosphere to&#13;
exploit the country's comparative advantage vigorously by emphasizing the&#13;
accumulation of skills and diffusion of new technologies.&#13;
In the Turkish case, the apparent availability and untapped&#13;
potential of the natural resources have been generally seen as promising&#13;
factors  in  Turkey's  :Long-term development.    Consequently,  the prevalent&#13;
attitudes toward the natural resource potential of Turkey led to a policy&#13;
outlook in which outward-looking industrialization did not appear as&#13;
necessary.   However,  after experiencing domestic hardships in adjusting to&#13;
higher prices of imported oil in the late 1970s, more realistic public&#13;
attitudes have started to emerge regarding the need to complement primary&#13;
exports with export-oriented non-primary activities (including service as well&#13;
as manufactured exports).&#13;
Furthermore, the unprecedented growth of the population and the&#13;
rural influx to the urban areas after 1950 also created an environment in&#13;
which the internal market expanded rapidly for a wide range of manufactured&#13;
products, which could be produced domestically behind high tariff walls."/&#13;
The continual changes in the rural-urban mix of the population produced&#13;
compositional shifts in consumer demand, generated additional domestic&#13;
requirements for processed consumer goods, and thus contributed to the&#13;
expansion   of  home   market-oriented   manufacturing   output.     The  large&#13;
1/ At this point, we merely point out the demand effects of demographic&#13;
phenomena, and do not mention other direct and indirect effects on savings&#13;
rates, labor marketsl, public services, and pressures on rural and urban&#13;
land. Tuncer (1976) provides a thorough review of demographic aspects in&#13;
socio-economic development, and examines the determinants of the Turkish&#13;
fertility rates in a cross-sectional and time-series study.&#13;

inequalities in income distribution (with a Gini coefficient of around 0.55)&#13;
also created a bias in the structure of private consumption demand for&#13;
consumer durables.    This led to considerable opportunities for high-cost&#13;
import substitution in metal fabricating industries.l/&#13;
(2)Institutional Conditions&#13;
The political conditions in the earlier periods of the Republic&#13;
produced deep-seated non-economic motivation for long-term development&#13;
policies. The unforgotten experiences of the Ottoman capitulations (involving&#13;
the loss of tax and tariff autonomy in some instances), and the difficult&#13;
negotiations for the settlement of old debts contributed to the growth of&#13;
economic nationalism. Preserving national sovereignty and achieving economic&#13;
independence (often interpreted as "self-sufficiency") became the priorities&#13;
of the national governments.     These long-term tendencies were apparent in&#13;
certain attitudes toward development, such as the reluctance to allow large-&#13;
scale foreign private investment, the inclination to use a restrictive trade&#13;
regime, and the preference for protected and inward-oriented industriali-&#13;
zation.&#13;
The central concern with "self-sufficiency' also led to state&#13;
ownership in those sectors of the economy which were perceived as strategic by&#13;
the government.   Lacking the preconditions of middle-class based capitalist&#13;
growth in the industrial and social overhead sectors, public authorities&#13;
introduced the etatist approach to development in the 1930s, which led to the&#13;
formation of a large state economic enterprise system (SEEs) to complement&#13;

private activity in the! economy..Y&#13;
Pioneers in the development of key industries in the earlier&#13;
periods, the public enterprises increasingly became institutional instruments&#13;
for regional development, employment expansion and extra-market interventions&#13;
on social-political grounds. However, because their operational and financial&#13;
performances were generally inadequate, steadily rising budgetary transfers&#13;
and deficit   financing  from the Central Bank were      required.   Without  a&#13;
reasonably well-functioning price mechanism and/or efficient public planning,&#13;
Turkey's mixed economy eventually became dualistic, and featured non-&#13;
integrated public and private enterprise subsystems with different types of&#13;
resource mobilization   and allocation.     The failure   to build integrative&#13;
mechanisms in Turkey's mixed economy (i.e., establishing common rules for&#13;
finance, pricing and employment in state and private industrial enterprises)&#13;
has caused pervasive (listortions in the structure of savings, costs and&#13;
prices, and has thereby created numerous stumbling blocks for the adoption of&#13;
a flexible and outward-looking strategy in industrial development.&#13;
(3) Economic Policies and The Structure of Protection&#13;
The slow pace of the institutional development in Turkey's mixed&#13;
economy system (particularly in the area of tax and financial subsystems, SEE&#13;
organization,  economy-wLde marketing arrangements,    and suitably structured&#13;
agricultural co-operatives and small ancillary industries) produced a setting&#13;
in which governments often formulated and pursued their economic policies in&#13;
an ad hoc manner.    Until recently, governments relied almost exclusively on&#13;
1/ See,e.g., Johnson (1967) and Solis (1971) for discussions of state&#13;
ownership   under  economic   nationalism  in   general,  and   in  Mexico,&#13;
respectively. The genesis and rational of etatism are examined by Okyar&#13;
(1965). For a more recent analysis of Turkey's state manufacturing&#13;
enterprises, see Walestedt (1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
nou-price measures and selective policy means (such as concessional taxes,&#13;
import licences, preferential credits and administered prices) rather than&#13;
general policy instruments (fiscal, monetary and trade policy, including an&#13;
equilibrium rate of exchange) to achieve economy-wide objectives.&#13;
While producing some results in specific sectors, the tendency to&#13;
use selective measures and direct interventions as a predominant policy&#13;
approach created serious problems in the consistency and efficiency of savings&#13;
generation and resource allocation in the country.    The adverse consequences&#13;
of avoiding general policy instruments have been particularly apparent in the&#13;
balance of payments. Control of the external accounts through ad hoc measures&#13;
proved to be cumbersome as well as counter-productive because the value of a&#13;
key policy tool, the foreign exchange rate, was unadjusted.         After major&#13;
devaluations, the unchecked erosion in the real exchange rate often resulted&#13;
in the significant decline of the relative value of incentives for activities&#13;
that augmented foreign exchange (i.e., earnings and/or savings), as examined&#13;
in detail by Krueger (1974) and Dervis and Robinson (1978) for 1950-70 and&#13;
1973-77, respectively .V&#13;
The   long-term    institutional   tendencies    for   inward-looking&#13;
industrialization were reinforced by the prolonged use of a semi-closed trade&#13;
and exchange rate regime, which discriminated against exports, and accorded&#13;
increased rates of effective protection at higher stages of fabrication (as&#13;
discussed In the final part of Chapter 5). The real effective exchange rates&#13;
provided insufficient incentives for export promotion, while the system of&#13;
protection contributed to the development of highly import-dependent private&#13;
manufacturing industries, which could be maintained only by massive capital&#13;

3. Prospects for Transition 2/&#13;
Recent Policy Changes&#13;
As pointed out in Chapter 1, Turkey's delayed policy response to the&#13;
*xternal shocks of the mid-1970s were very costly in term of aggregate growth&#13;
losses, hyperinflation and political instability in 1977-80.      External trade&#13;
disequilibrium was clearly the principal factor behind the economic&#13;
dislocations of the late 1970s.     Foreign exchange stringency had restricted&#13;
the inflow of imports that were required (almost in fixed proportions) for&#13;
current production as well as capacity expansions needed for future growth.&#13;
Interruptions in growth occurred despite the existence of a sizable parallel&#13;
market and illegal imports that were largely financed by workers' remittances&#13;
outside official channels.&#13;
As shown in this study, the trade imbalances that emerged in the&#13;
1970s were mainly of a structural nature. Their gradual elimination required&#13;
an effective combination of anticyclical and structural policies in the&#13;
medium-run.    However, the removal of the trade limit to income growth was&#13;
particularly difficult because of, on the one hand, the long-term character of&#13;
the supply measures taken to increase primary energy production and reduce oil&#13;
imports and, on the other, the increasing technological complexity and capital&#13;
intensity of import substitution in intermediate manufactured goods.       In an&#13;
industrializing economy such as Turkey's, the budgetary, technological and&#13;
skill constraints require an increasingly selective approach to import&#13;
1/ Krueger (1974, pp.208) shows that Turkey's non-traditional exports were&#13;
highly responsive to real exchange rate changes in 1950-69.&#13;
2/ The present discussion partly draws on the author's earlier assessments&#13;
(Celasun, 1980 b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
substitution in its later stages, which results in an alternating sequence of&#13;
capacity expansions in the industrial subsectors. Thus, the aggregate import-&#13;
output ratio tends to stabilize, if not gradually rise, over time.      Accord-&#13;
ingly, the possibility of removing the trade bottleneck and resuming self-&#13;
sustained growth by further contraction of real aggregate imports was limited&#13;
in the late 1970s and will remain limited in the intermediate future. On the&#13;
eve of the 1980s, the resumption of growth required, therefore, a decisive&#13;
change in development strategy toward higher export orientation and more&#13;
efficient import substitution.i/&#13;
The policy package that was implemented in early 1980 signified a&#13;
determined political effort to set in motion government actions and market&#13;
forces to curb hyperinflation, and to initiate a more open development&#13;
process.2/ In addition to emphasizing the usual price measures in an IMF-&#13;
style stabilization-cum-devaluation program, the policy package introduced a&#13;
new set of policies for Turkey's mixed economy system. While lifting the&#13;
formal price controls in the private manufacturing industry, and granting a&#13;
considerable autonomy to public enterprises in their future pricing decisions,&#13;
the new approach assigned a larger role to domestic and foreign private&#13;
capital in export promotion and investment (such as in oil and non-oil&#13;
mining).&#13;
In June 1980, the policy mix was extended by an official decree&#13;
which allowed the commercial banks to set their borrowing and lending rates&#13;
1/ The evidence for the urgent need to adopt a trade-oriented strategy was&#13;
rapidly accumulating by the end of 1979, as discussed in length in Balassa&#13;
(1979), Wolf (1980) and World Bank (1980).&#13;
2/ For detailed reviews of Turkey's stabilization policy experience in 1978-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
freely, subject to certain constraints on preferential credits and obligations&#13;
to contribute to an initerest subsidy fund. The fiscal component of the new&#13;
policy framework was strengthened in 1981 by new tax legislation and&#13;
restrained public spending.   The adoption of a flexible exchange rate policy&#13;
(which became more evident in early 1981) has been another cornerstone of the&#13;
new policy package.&#13;
As expected, the immediate economic effects of the 1980 policy&#13;
measures were very mixed, and took the form of the following: (1) a heavy&#13;
deflationary impact of monetary restraint and nominal price adjustments; (2)&#13;
intensified cost-push pressures on the general price level; (3) a sharp fall&#13;
in real wages and labor inrest, as a result; (4) increased capital inflows and&#13;
imports; and (5) a slor response from exports initially.       The attempts to&#13;
implement a restrained wage policy led to numerous strikes, produced&#13;
considerable unrest, and resulted in the loss of 7.7 million work days in the&#13;
first eight months of 1980, comparing poorly with the 1.15 million work days&#13;
lost during 1979.     After the military takeover in September 1980, public&#13;
sector workers with unsettled wage agreements were granted a tentative raise&#13;
of about 70 percent in gross nominal wages, pending formal settlements in 1981&#13;
and 1982. The deflationary impact and cost-push effects of the stabilization&#13;
measures resulted in a -2.2 percent growth in real GNP, and about a 94.7&#13;
percent rise in the Wholesale Price Index 1/&#13;
Once industriaL production resumed after the military intervention&#13;
and the new policies were strictly implemented (buttressed in 1981 by a tax&#13;
reform package), real GNP increased by about 4.4 percent in 1981, while the&#13;
1/  The year-on-year rate of inflation was 132 percent in March 1980, but fell&#13;
to 94.7 percent in December 1980, 38 percent in June 1981, and 27.3&#13;
percent in November 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
year-on-year inflation decelerated sharply to 27.3 percent in November 1981.&#13;
The balance of paymnts rapidly improved, with merchandise exports amd&#13;
workers' remittances rising to about $4.7 and $2.5 billion in 1981 from $2.8&#13;
and $2.1 billion levels, respectively, in 1980.    In the external sector, the&#13;
particularly   encouraging  new  trends   have  been   the  increased  product&#13;
diversification in exports; the expansion of trading opportunities in the&#13;
Middle East; and the growing involvement of the Turkish contractors in the&#13;
infrastructure development projects of various oil-surplus countries in the&#13;
region.&#13;
Apart from the remaining problems (such as SEE reorganization,&#13;
rising unemployment and poor distribution of income), the improved&#13;
macroeconomic performance in 1981 bolstered general confidence at home and&#13;
abroad in the country's ability to halt the deepening crisis, and to switch to&#13;
a more viable growth path in the 1980s.&#13;
Policy-Making and Planning in the 1980s&#13;
When domestic inflation is under control, the formal policy&#13;
objectives need to be shifted in a balanced way from price stabilization to&#13;
the removal of external disequilibrium and long-term restructuring of the&#13;
economy in order to prosote sore employment and better income distribution.&#13;
The current account deficits ned to be reduced to historically normal and/or&#13;
financially  manageable proportions of GNP, while sufficient capacity      for&#13;
Import growthi to sustain a steady expansion of employment and GNP close to&#13;
potential output levels should be developed.    This task requires a concerted&#13;
social effort to restructure factor allocation and domestic production in&#13;
order to maximize the capacity for foreign exchange generation after a&#13;
reasonable period of adaptation. The development process needs reorientation&#13;
towards trade-improving activities, and requires a more effective integration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
of export promotion and import substitution under reduced protection.        As&#13;
shown in Chapter 4, increased export promotion and employment objectives are&#13;
conplesentary because more favorable labor-output ratios characterize the&#13;
potentially export-oriented subsectors (including capital goods and consumer&#13;
durables).&#13;
The transition toward greater trade orientation has significant&#13;
implications for Turkey's political economy as well as for economic management&#13;
methods in the 1980s, which are discussed in the following paragraphs.&#13;
(1) Relative Prices and Incomes&#13;
The basic issue in the political realm concerns the design of&#13;
socially responsible arrangements for the equitable sharing of sacrifices&#13;
required in the adjusltment process.      Above all, this process calls for&#13;
allocational and distributional changes to affect the transfer of real income&#13;
because of the sharply deteriorated terms of trade since the did-1970s. Until&#13;
the adoption of the 1980 policy package, the policyakers and organized socio-&#13;
economic groups avoided this adjustment through large-scale borrowing abroad,&#13;
and excessive monetary (expansion at home.&#13;
The assignment of higher priorities to trade-improving and resource&#13;
mobilization efforts will lead to the restrained growth of domestic&#13;
consumption and higher real prices for tradables and savings, with&#13;
corresponding income transfers from the users to the suppliers of scarce&#13;
foreign exchange and domestic capital.    Both the private firms and the SESs&#13;
will be involved in the process of interrelated price and income adjustments,&#13;
and will be confronted with changes in the pattern of real profits and&#13;
wages. An indicated in Chapter 4.E, the gradual adaptation to world prices in&#13;
non-primary product markets is likely to result in the slackening growth of&#13;
the previously overvalued factor incomes in the urban areas.      Clearly, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
distributional implications of relative price changes are very mixed, and they&#13;
require quantitative assessments in the future. A realistic and carefully&#13;
phased program is needed to reconcile the equity and growth objectives in the&#13;
new economic framework, with an emphasis on employment expansion in labor-&#13;
intensive sectors that increase foreign exchange.&#13;
(2) Resource Mobilization and Redirection of Investment&#13;
To support the 1980-81 policy measures, new financial resources need&#13;
to be significantly tapped and quickly directed to trade-improving activities.&#13;
Private savings (as reported in the national accounts) have recently exceeded&#13;
private investments, and have been partly drafted by the public sector through&#13;
the money creation processX      The new stabilization measures are designed to&#13;
reduce the size of forced savings (or deficit financing) by enlargening the&#13;
share of public revenue in GNP, with a corresponding decline in the growth of&#13;
private disposable income. With public investments having a larger share in&#13;
total investments (as projected in the official programs) and concentrated&#13;
mainly   in   capital-intensive   energy  and   infrastructure   projects,   the&#13;
mobilization and allocation of "rivate savings gain strategic importance in&#13;
expanding the production of tradable goods in the economy. As self-financing&#13;
in the private manufacturing industry decreases, more energetic efforts will&#13;
be required to attract foreign direct investment, and to mobilize workers'&#13;
remittances for the financing of export-oriented projects-2&#13;
(3) Reforming the Institutional Structure and Policy System&#13;
The modified aisa of the new development orientation will require&#13;
1/ Gross private savings (including deficit financing) are projected to reach&#13;
10 to 11 percent of GNP from 1981 onwards.&#13;
2/ See Wolf (1980) for an elucidation of the differential effects of various&#13;
types of capital Inflows in development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
major reforms in policy instruments and in the way they are implemented.      In&#13;
the policy reform process, a central task concerns the improvement of the&#13;
institutional effectiveness of Turkey's mixed economy, which has a large state&#13;
enterprise subsystem (SEEs) that complements private business activity.      As&#13;
noted earlier, the basic problem is not the large share of the SEEs, but&#13;
rather the dualism of the mixed economic system, which is characterized by&#13;
different types of economic behavior in its subsystems (public and private).&#13;
Instead of focusing solely on the legal and administrative aspects&#13;
of the SEEs, a series of steps may be taken to rationalize the economic basis&#13;
of the SEE decision-making procedures by insisting on the calculation of&#13;
economic returns and real subsidies (or the subsidy equivalent of effective&#13;
protection).   The subsidies may be specified annually and be subject to ex&#13;
post evaluations by public representatives. /       To further strengthen the&#13;
institutional base of Tlurkey's mixed economy, more efficient arrangements are&#13;
required for the operation of financial and labor markets.        The range of&#13;
financial instruments available to the public needs to be extended, while&#13;
measures should be taken to reduce the large spread that exists between the&#13;
relevant interest rates for borrowers of funds and suppliers of small savings.&#13;
In the difficult field of industrial relations, an early return to the system&#13;
of collective bargaining would help mobilize broad labor support for the new&#13;
development strategy.&#13;
If the functioning of the price mechanism improves, a more balanced&#13;
combination of general and selective instruments may be arranged in the&#13;
government's  policy package.     For example,   a crucial move would be the&#13;
preparation of a timetable for the gradual restructuring of the trade regime&#13;
1/ See Walstedt (1980, pp.196) for the outline of a reform program for the&#13;
SEEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
in order to provide appropriate guidelines for micro-level planning of export&#13;
promotion and import substitution. The modified protectionist system may&#13;
formally aim to remove the inherent bias against exports (by narrowing the&#13;
product range of probibited imports); reduce discrimination among industries&#13;
to normal proportions; and increase the effectiveness of the exchange rate&#13;
instrument as an equilibriating mechanism for the balance of payments.      The&#13;
redesign of the trade policy framework may be complemented by sector-specific&#13;
studies   to   identify  promising   lines   of  vertical   and/or   horizontal&#13;
specialization for selective support by the government.&#13;
The suggested policy changes involve a variety of political and&#13;
technical issues, and they should be viewed as a continual reform process that&#13;
can only be implemented in stages. Turkey's planning machinery also needs to&#13;
be tailored to the new circumstances with a sharper focus on the optimal mix&#13;
of policy aims and means in a dynamic setting. The reorientation of the&#13;
planning work would require the development of indigenous research capacity,&#13;
and less involvement in operational matters, which can be delegated to the&#13;
relevant agencies.&#13;
(4) Accelerating Total Factor Productivity Growth&#13;
There is the need and scope for an economy-wide drive to increase&#13;
total factor productivity growth in the 19809.      This is apparent from the&#13;
domestic and foreign capital constraints on aggregate growth, low levels of&#13;
capacity utilization and productivity in most sectors (including agriculture),&#13;
and unused potential of applied research in the country. The applied research&#13;
efforts should be directed towards the diffusion and adaptation of technical&#13;
innovations that have capital-saving and energy-conserving biases in&#13;
production. An improved and wider use of the semi-skilled labor potential of&#13;
the country would also buttress the sustained expansion of exports of goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
and packaged services to the oil-surplus areas in the Middle East.&#13;
Finally, the domestic economic performance in the medium-run will&#13;
also depend on the changes that are taking place in the world economy. Newly&#13;
evolving   external   conditions  require   highly   innovative   policies  and&#13;
arrangements to develop more productive and supportive forms of co-operation&#13;
at the international and regional levels.&#13;
C. Future Research&#13;
The findings of this study can be complemented and extended by&#13;
research in several promising directions.      A simple, but useful follow-up&#13;
would be to express the study's input-output data in deflated world prices,&#13;
and to reestimate    the sources of growth with the same methodology.         To&#13;
compensate partly for the use of domestic prices in our analytical&#13;
assessments, the effects of domestic price distortions on value added growth&#13;
rates in 1953-78 have been estimated.     (See Chapter 4)     Another practical&#13;
extension relates to the estimation of the sources of multi-sectoral growth&#13;
from 1973-77, when negative import substitution became more pronounced, and&#13;
export expansion effects declined sharply, as shown in an economy-wide&#13;
analysis by Balassa (1981).L/&#13;
One of the more challenging research tasks would be to integrate the&#13;
production function approach and the input-output methods used in this&#13;
project.    However,  a major   problem here would be the lack of reliable&#13;
estimates for capital stocks and functional distribution of income at the&#13;
sectoral level.   Nonetheless, with judiciously assembled and "guesstimated"&#13;
production-function  data,  a useful   attempt  may  be made   to  construct  a&#13;
historical price-endogenous multi-sectoral model, which should be able to&#13;

unusual cyclical characteristics and import shortages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
track structural changes occurring under given policies and exogenous&#13;
conditions,I' With the aid of such a model, deeper issues may be examined,&#13;
such as the distributional consequences of semi-closed trade policies and the&#13;
distorting effects of dual economic behavior in public and private&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
For the immediate policy concerns in the early 1980s, empirical&#13;
research connected with the estimation of incentive and cost-benefit&#13;
indicators at the disaggregated level is particularly relevant for the&#13;
redesign of the system of protection. The commodity-level cost surveys which&#13;
have already been initiated should be complemented by sectoral studies&#13;
covering demand and supply aspects, including the possible restructuring of&#13;
the existing operations under the newly adopted trade-oriented strategy.&#13;

multi-sectoral model in analyzing trade-growth relationships in 1973-83.&#13;

APPENDIX 1&#13;
MODELS FOR SOURCES OF GROWTH DECOMPOSITION&#13;
A. Methodology in Brief&#13;
A.1 Major Characteristics of the Models Used in the Present Study&#13;
Appendix I gives the algebra of the models used to analyze the&#13;
sources of growth and structural change in Turkish economic development during&#13;
the sample period 1953-73.    Although the thrust of the study is to decompose&#13;
factors which jointly caused differences in the rates of production growth in&#13;
the various sectors of the economy, the analysis is also extended to the&#13;
determination of the sources of changes in the sectoral patterns of value&#13;
added, imports, factor use and relative prices.&#13;
The fundamental logic of the models is based on the earlier&#13;
contributions of (1) Chenery (1960); (2) Chenery, Shishido and Watanabe's&#13;
investigation of the Japanese industrialization experience (CSW, 1962); and&#13;
(3) their subsequent modifications, which are reviewed elsewhere by Fane&#13;
(1973) and Syrquin (1976).&#13;
These models differ from the sources of growth models in the&#13;
tradition of the celebrated work of Denison (1967). The Denison-type models&#13;
employ the production-function approach, and attempt to measure the relative&#13;
contributions of primary factor accumulation and reallocation in the aggregate&#13;
growth process. Hatiboglu (1978) adopts the Denison approach in his general&#13;
appraisal of Turkish economic growth in 1950-75 with imputed factor returns in&#13;
the nonagricultural sectors.&#13;
The type of models used in the present analysis have the following&#13;
significant characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
(i) The principal Eeature of the line of research originally established&#13;
by Chenery (1960) and CSW (1962) is that, with the material balance (supply-&#13;
demand) equations in an input-output (I-0) framework as a basis, the shifts in&#13;
the sectoral structure of production (or of a related vector such as value-&#13;
added, factor use, etc..) are attributed to a number of supply and demand&#13;
factors, which are treated as autonomous elements in the analysis. These&#13;
autonomous elements, which are also referred to as causal factors, are usually&#13;
the following: (1) domestic final demand; (2) technological change (or, more&#13;
specifically, changes in I-0 coefficients); (3) exports; and (4) import-&#13;
substitution. In some versions of the models, the elements (1) and (2) are&#13;
combined under the catelgory of domestic demand effect, and (3) and (4) are&#13;
considered the trade effect on the growth and structural change of the&#13;
variable under examination.&#13;
(ii)   In empirical iLmplementation, there are two types of measures that&#13;
can be used to quantify the changes observed in the sectoral variables over a&#13;
given time frame: (1) first differences (increments) and (2) deviations from a&#13;
proportional (or balanceel) growth path. The deviation measures are calculated&#13;
with respect to a reference growth pattern in which all relevant variables of&#13;
the  input-output   system   grow  at  a   specified  "norm"   rate,  called   the&#13;
proportionality factor. In the sources of growth analysis of production,&#13;
value-added and imports, the proportionality factor is considered the ratio of&#13;
gross domestic product (G]DP) in the terminal year to that of the base year. In&#13;
the analysis of price changes, this factor becomes the ratio of the general&#13;
price level in the terminal and base years.&#13;
(iii) The use of an input-output (I-0) framework in the sources analysis&#13;
also permits the distinction between the direct and total effects of the&#13;
autonomous elements in the! process of growth and structural change. The total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
effects reflect the indirect linkage effects of a change in the production&#13;
level of a particular sector in the economy.     In this study, the direct and&#13;
total effects are calculated separately, but the results are presented&#13;
selectively in the text for cases that are relevant to the discussion.&#13;
(iv)   The empirical work along the lines of the pioneering CSW models&#13;
requires comparable interindustry data for the benchmark periods at the same&#13;
level of sector aggregation. Among the problems were the typical statistical&#13;
difficulties in processing available sectoral data in a format permitting&#13;
comparisons over time.   This was particularly hard for the earlier periods in&#13;
which there are no I-0 tables, such as the benchmark periods 1952-54 (average)&#13;
and 1957-59 (average).    In addition, deflating all data to a common price&#13;
basis was cumbersome.    The deflation of current price I-0 data to constant&#13;
prices is essential under two sets of circumstances: (1) if there were&#13;
intersectoral differences in price movements, and/or (2) if there were&#13;
intrasectoral differences in the changes of production, import and export&#13;
prices over time.&#13;
In the Turkish context, these two types of price variations were&#13;
significant enough to warrant complementary research on the construction of&#13;
appropriate price indices, and the deflation of all current price data into&#13;
the constant prices of a suitable reference period, which was selected as the&#13;
year 1968. The latter serves as the base year for deflated official national&#13;
income data.    An integral part of the study was time-consuming empirical&#13;
research to deflate the current price sectoral production and trade data for&#13;
the benckmark periods (1952-54 (average), 1957-59 (average), 1963, 1968 and&#13;
1973), as described in Appendix 2. The mathematical formulas presented below&#13;
have been applied to Turkish intersectoral data measured in real terms by 1968&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
constant domestic priced!.&#13;
(v)   Another common difficulty in the sources of growth decomposition&#13;
calculations  over a specified    period is an index number problem.         The&#13;
resolution of this problem requires a choice of using either (1) the base&#13;
period volume weights, while using the structural coefficients of the terminal&#13;
period, or (2) the terminal period volume weights, while using the structural&#13;
coefficients of the base period.      In a way, the problem is conceptually&#13;
similar to decomposing a change in value terms into price and quantity&#13;
indices. An attempt is made to circumvent this problem by computing both the&#13;
Laspeyres and Paasche types of decomposition measures, as indicated in the&#13;
mathematical formulations below.&#13;
A.2 Treatment of Import Substitution&#13;
The treatment of import substitution (IS) is a source of dispute in&#13;
empirical research for the field.      The evolution of the treatment in the&#13;
literature is broadly summarized as follows:&#13;
(i) An early contribution by Chenery (1960), which used deviation&#13;
measures, treated the IS factor in terms of changes in the share of imports in&#13;
the total supply of a given sector.       Lewis and Soligo (1965) adopted the&#13;
approach of Chenery (1960) in their assessment of the Pakistan growth&#13;
experience, but preferred to work with first differences as measures of&#13;
changes in the sectoral output and trade variables. These two studies were&#13;
both conducted in terms of direct effects, and had not explicitly incorporated&#13;
the effects of I-0 linkages and coefficient changes over time.&#13;
1/ In future investigations of the Turkish economic transformation, a&#13;
significant contribution would be to deflate the available I-0 data into&#13;
constant world market prices to remove the distorting effects of economic&#13;
rents in national income formation, as aptly pointed out by Hatiboglu&#13;
(1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
(ii) CSW (1962), in their study of Japanese growth, which considered the&#13;
domestic linkage effects of causal factors, measured the IS factor in terms of&#13;
deviation of import growth from the proportional path of expansion. Although&#13;
such an IS measure somewhat reflects the actual replacement of imports by&#13;
domestic production, it does not adequately measure changes in the sectoral&#13;
ratios of output (or imports) to total supply.&#13;
(iii)  Criticizing the IS measure of CSW (1962), Morley and Smith (1970)&#13;
proposed a variant approach to IS.     They introduced a new concept of gross&#13;
(redefined) imports, which was to be obtained by premultiplying the import&#13;
vector by the Leontief inverse, and measuring IS as the change in the share of&#13;
gross (redefined) imports in total (redefined) supply incorporating gross&#13;
output  and  gross  imports.    In Morley and    Smith  (1970),  the IS factor&#13;
represents the domestic production recessary to substitute completely for&#13;
imports, which is an extreme view of the actual IS process.      Similarly, Fane&#13;
(1973) suggested an alternative measure of IS involving two components:&#13;
namely, IS in sector (j), and indirect IS contributions of production increase&#13;
in sector (j). As in Chenery (1960), Lewis and Soligo (1965), and Morley and&#13;
Smith (1970), Pane also employed the share method in defining IS by focusing&#13;
on the changing share of imports in total supply over time.&#13;
(iv)   More recent contributions to the analysis of IS came from Syrquin&#13;
(1976) and Balassa (1976).    Again adopting the share approach, Syrquin seeks&#13;
to quantify the effects of changes in the ratio of imports to total domestic&#13;
demand, and proposes a series of refinements in the treatment of imports and&#13;
IS for situations where detailed data of import use are available. In turn,&#13;
Balassa extends the two-commodity trade model of Johnson (1962) to a&#13;
multisectoral context, and seeks to explain changes in imports over time in&#13;
terms of pro-trade and anti-trade biases in production and consumption.       In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
the Balassa framework, import-substitution is defined in terms of deviations&#13;
of the growth rates of the sector's production and consumption from the&#13;
Oneutral growth," i.e., the growth rate of national product.&#13;
In the present Turkey study, the IS factor is treated along the&#13;
lines of the CSW (1962) and Syrquin (1976) formulations, which are also&#13;
referred to as constant composition and constant share (or, for short,&#13;
composition and share) methods.       To provide additional evidence on the&#13;
changing pattern of imsports, the decomposition measures for the sources of&#13;
growth of imports (by commodity, i.e., by sector of origin) are also&#13;
calculated and presented for selected periods in 1953-73.&#13;
In recent research on observed IS in Turkish economic growth, Korum&#13;
(1976) adopts the Lewis and Soligo (1965) measurement of the IS contribution&#13;
to growth, and provides sectoral estimates of this measure (at a 37 sector&#13;
level of aggregation) by using the current price sectoral production and trade&#13;
data available in the 1963, 1968 and 1973 I-0 tables. Despite the calculation&#13;
of only direct effects, and the use of undeflated sectoral data, the overall&#13;
conclusions of Korum's study are similar to those here in that the role of&#13;
trade effects in TurkishL industrial growth has been very narrow in 1963-73.&#13;
This review of the sources of growth models suggests that their&#13;
analytical frameworks need to be extended in a number of new directions.       A&#13;
possible extension wouLd be the integration of the aggregate production-&#13;
function approach of Denison (1967) with the I-0 methods used here.          The&#13;
accumulation of primary factor inputs (i.e., capital and labor) and their&#13;
continual reallocation over time interact with the causal factors identified&#13;
in the I-0 models of sources of growth.        Within a broader framework of&#13;
analysis, the growth contributions of a variety of autonomous factors&#13;
(including factor inputs as well as exports, IS and technical progress) may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
quantified more systematically.   Another direction of extension would be the&#13;
explicit introduction of policy variables into the sources of growth&#13;
investigations.    In  future  research,   the  historically  validated  price-&#13;
endogenous I-0 models, which allow direct substitution in production and&#13;
consumption, are likely to serve as more comprehensive frameworks to establish&#13;
causal chains between past policies and observed growth and structural change&#13;
in individual economies.&#13;
B. Notation&#13;
The analytical frameworks used in this study are briefly sketched&#13;
here to facilitate the interpretation of the empirical findings presented in&#13;
the text.-&#13;
All frameworks are structured around the Leontief I-0 system, in&#13;
which the sectors are denoted by the subscripts i and/or J. In this research&#13;
i,j - 1,2,... 25. With each application, the frameworks are implemented over&#13;
a time period with specified base and end years, which are typically&#13;
designated in the literature as period 1 and period 2, respectively. For the&#13;
sake of simplicity, equations are given in matrix form.        All I-0 data is&#13;
expressed in constant prices, unless otherwise indicated.        The notations&#13;
adopted are the following:&#13;
Xt  : production (or output) vector in period t (t-1,2),&#13;
Dt  : domestic final demand vector in period t (t-1,2),&#13;
Wt  : intermediate demand vector in period t (t-l,2).&#13;
Et  : export vector in period t (t-1,2),&#13;
Mt  : import vector in period t (t-1,2),&#13;
At  : matrix of (total) input-output coefficients in period t (t-1,2)&#13;

the alternative formulas for decomposition measures.&#13;

C. Sources of Growth Decomposition of Production (Gross Output)&#13;
C.1 Basic Conventions&#13;
In this part of Appendix 1, the modified forms of measures&#13;
originally proposed by CSW (1962) and Syrquin (1976) are presented for the&#13;
decomposition of sources of growth in sectoral production (or gross output).&#13;
Three important points should be noted.&#13;
First, these measures may be calculated for three cases: where (A)&#13;
the sectoral import data are not separately available for final and&#13;
intermediate uses; (B) the import matrix is available; and (C) the breakdown&#13;
of imports into final and intermediate uses is known without the availability&#13;
of a full import matrix.    In the Turkish application, we proceed with Case A&#13;
due to the lack of import data by sector of use in earlier benchmark&#13;
periods ./&#13;
Second, the decomposition measures may be defined under the direct&#13;
(D) and total (T) methods, depending on whether or not the intersectoral&#13;
1/ The term "absolute change" is widely used in the literature, but its usage&#13;
is not strictly proper in the mathematical sense since the first&#13;
differences may also have a negative sign.&#13;
2/ See Chakraverty et al (1973) and the recently completed study by SIS&#13;
(1979) for estimated import matrices for 1968 and 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
linkages are taken into account in the computations. Under the total method,&#13;
the intersectoral impact of direct effects (of causal factors) is explicitly&#13;
introduced in the analysis.&#13;
Third, the measures are calculated under two versions of treatment&#13;
of the index number problem. The Laspeyres and Paasche indices are defined on&#13;
the basis of the I-0 coefficients used as weights. Thus, the Laspeyres version&#13;
(L) employs the I-0 coefficients of the first period, while the Paasche&#13;
version (P) adopts the second period I-0 coefficients as the relevant&#13;
weights.    In the text, the arithmetic averages of Laspeyres and Paasche&#13;
measures are presented, unless otherwise indicated.1! In the context of these&#13;
conventions, the following labels are used to designate the decomposition&#13;
formulations under either the constant composition or share method:&#13;
-DAL: Direct measures; no breakdown of imports by use; Laspeyres version&#13;
-DAP: Direct measures; no breakdown of imports by use; Paasche version&#13;
-TAL: Total measures; no breakdown of imports by use; Laspeyres version&#13;
-TAP: Total measures; no breakdown of imports by use; Paasche version&#13;
In principle, unless stated otherwise, the sources of growth and&#13;
structural change are decomposed into the following causal factors:&#13;
-Domestic demand expansion (DDE)&#13;
-Export expansion (EE)&#13;
-Import substitution (IS)&#13;
-Change in I-0 coefficients or technological change (TC)&#13;
To ensure comparability with the notation of other country studies&#13;
1/ In the cases where an I-0 matrix is not available for the first period&#13;
(e.g., for the benchmark years 1953 and 1958), the Laspeyres version of&#13;
the decomposition equations is used in a modified form, by substituting&#13;
the second period 1-0 matrix for the first period (unobserved) matrix, and&#13;
then determinine the effect of changes in I-0 coefficients as a residual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
of sources of growth, the causal factor DDE refers to domestic final demand&#13;
expansion under the total method, whereas it consists of final and&#13;
intermediate parts under the direct method.      (See the equations for direct&#13;
measures below. j/&#13;
C.2 Constant Composition (CSW) Method&#13;

deviation measures are calculated. The additional definitions needed for this&#13;
method are:&#13;

D. Sources of Growth Decomposition of Value Added&#13;
In view of the changes that occur in value added coefficients over&#13;
time, the sources of growth analysis may be expressed in net output or value&#13;
added terms, rather than in gross output. This procedure is particularly&#13;
suited to the analysis of trade effects on industrialization when structural&#13;
shifts in exports reflect only minor improvements in the stages of primary&#13;
commodities before they are shipped to export markets (as in the cases of&#13;
fruit, tobacco and cotton processing in Turkey's export trade).&#13;
Let   Vit : value added in sector i in period t (t-1,2)&#13;
vit : value added coefficient I in period t (t-1,2)&#13;
In matrix form,&#13;
vt ' vtXt&#13;
where vt is a diagotnal matrix of coefficients.&#13;
Then, the contributions to change in value added over time may&#13;
broadly be decomposed into two parts as follows:&#13;
Change in&#13;
Production Change           Value Added Coefficient&#13;
Deviation:&#13;
Laspeyres               SV- v   ax      +            (Av) X2&#13;
&#13;

Paasche                +V v2 6x                      (Av) XX&#13;
First Difference:&#13;
Laspeyres               AV - v1 AX       +            (Av) X2&#13;
Paasche                 AV      A v2 AX  +            (Av) X1&#13;
By further decomposing the vector of production change into its&#13;
component vectors (by either the composition or share measures above), it is&#13;
possible to differentiate the effects of five causal factors in value added&#13;
growth and structural change: (1) DDE, (2) EE, (3) IS, (4) changes in 1-0&#13;
coefficients, and (5) changes in value added coefficients.&#13;
E. Sources of Growth Decomposition of Imports&#13;
The sources of import growth are decomposed by first difference&#13;
measures by adapting Syrquin's (1976) methodology to the case where&#13;
disaggregated data of import use are not available. The following definitions&#13;
are introduced:&#13;
it  Mit / (Dit + Wt), and&#13;
mt  - diagonal matrix of mits.&#13;

F. Sources of Growth Decomposition of Primary Factors&#13;
The sources of growth of primary factors can be analyzed with the&#13;
approach outlined for the decomposition of value added changes.&#13;
Let Qit: pr:lmary factor use in sector i in period t (t-1,2)&#13;
qit: primary factor coefficient i in period t (t-1,2)&#13;
In matrix form&#13;
Qt   q t xt&#13;
where qt is a. diagonal matrix of coefficients.&#13;
Then, the firet stage of the decomposition process proceeds as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
Change in&#13;
Production Change              Factor Coefficient&#13;
Deviation&#13;
Laspeyres                  Q -q   6           +           (Aq)X2&#13;
Paasche                   6Q   q2 6X          +           (Aq)X1&#13;
First Difference&#13;
Laspeyres                 AQ - qAX            +           (Aq)X2&#13;
Paasche                   AQ -q2 AX           +           (Aq)X1&#13;
In the second stage of analysis, the vector of production change can&#13;
be decomposed into its component parts with any one of either the total or&#13;
direct decomposition equations outlined in Appendix 1.C.      In this study, the&#13;
changes in value added and employment are decomposed by the constant share&#13;
method.&#13;
An alternative approach suggested by Watanabe (1975) attempts to&#13;
separate the total effects of two main phenomena (net final demand expansion&#13;
and changes in production technologies) as follows:&#13;
Let       Ft : net final demand vector in period t&#13;
Then,     AQ    q2R2 F2- q1    1  1&#13;
Total Effect of&#13;
A&#13;
or,       AQ    q2 R2 AF                      Net final demand expansion&#13;
+ A(qR)F1                        Changes in production&#13;
technologies&#13;
Changes in production technologies involve changes in both I-0 and&#13;
factor coefficients.   Because it is more suitable to aggregate analysis, the&#13;
latter approach is employed in analyzing the changes in fixed investments in&#13;
the two successive five-year periods during 1963-73.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
G. Sources of Changes in Relative Sector Prices&#13;
The sources of differential changes in sectoral gross output prices&#13;
are decomposed under a miodified form of a price model originally designed by&#13;
Watanabe   (1975) .2    For  the   analysis  of  price  changes,   the  following&#13;
additional variables are introduced:&#13;
Pit :   price (index) of output of sector i (t-1,2)&#13;
Vit :   current price value added of sector i (t-1,2)&#13;
Yit :   current price wage rate of sector I (t-1,2)&#13;
Also, let   Nit -   number of employees in sector I (t-1,2)&#13;
8   :   ratio of general price level in period 2 to that of&#13;
period 1.&#13;
Nit&#13;
nit   Xit&#13;
z     Xi  ' yi   ni  + residual&#13;
i  it    it    t&#13;
6i1   Pi2    ail&#13;
i    1i2     11&#13;
In matrix notation, price formation In the I-0 system is given as:&#13;
t    t  t&#13;
1/ Watanabe (1975) analyzes price changes in a larger framework incorporating&#13;
capltal and labor inputs and prices.       In the absence of capital stock&#13;
data, the present pric:e analysis treats the effects of changes in capital-&#13;
output and profit ratios on a residual basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
where the sign (') denotes a transposed matrix.&#13;
Then,&#13;
(2) pP' - Z2 (AR) + (AZ') R1&#13;
(3) Sz' - y; (An) + ni (dY) + Residual&#13;
Hence, the sources of deviations in prices may be decomposed as follows:&#13;
Total Effect of:&#13;
(4) 8P' - Z2 (AR)                       Changes in I-0 structures&#13;
A&#13;
+ Y2 (An) R.                  Changes in labor productivity&#13;
A&#13;
+ ni (Sy) R1                  Deviations in wages&#13;
+ Residual                    Changes in residual value added&#13;
Remark: The changes in "residual" comprise changes in the non-wage components&#13;
of the value added (such as rents, depreciation, profits, indirect&#13;
taxes and subsidies). When the capital stock data become available,&#13;
the equation (4) may be adjusted accordingly.&#13;

APPENDIX 2&#13;
DEFLATION OF THE TURKISH 1-0 TABLES:&#13;
A Summary Note on the Methodology and Related Empirical Research&#13;
A. General&#13;
This sources of growth study for Turkey is largely made possible by&#13;
three I-0 tables available for the benchmark years 1963, 1968 and 1973. These&#13;
tables have been adjusted and re-organized around 25X25 sectors, as defined in&#13;
Tables A2.1 and A2.2. The 1963 and 1973 tables were then deflated to constant&#13;
1968 prices. For the earlier benchmark years 1953 and 1958 (for which I-0&#13;
tables are not available), the data on sectoral output, trade and final demand&#13;
are also processed at the 25 sector level of aggregation, and estimated in&#13;
1968 prices.&#13;
The deflation oE the 1963 and 1973 tables to constant 1968 prices by&#13;
the double deflation method is briefly described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
(The deflation effort wasg somewhat simplified because imports are classified&#13;
by sector of origin (i.e., on a competitive basis) in the official Turkish I-0&#13;
tables.)&#13;
B. Deflation Procedure&#13;

matrix   (I-A )    , these two sets of estimates for    X  will be only&#13;
approximately equal.     In the Turkey exercise, the estimates (X )&#13;
obtained by Equations (1) and (8) turned out to be very close for&#13;
both benchmarlc years (1963 and 1973). In the analysis of sources of&#13;
growth, the estimates obtained by equation (8) are adopted in the&#13;
calculation of production growth and deviations from proportional&#13;
expansion.&#13;
(ii)     The value added coefficients (including indirect taxes on&#13;
sectoral output and imports) are the following:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
Similarly, gross domestic product measured in current and&#13;
constant prices becomes,respectively:&#13;
GDP - E v X&#13;
and&#13;
*      * *&#13;
GDP - 5 viXi&#13;
For the comparison of national income estimates and deflated I-0&#13;
aggregates, sectoral value added figures are recomputed in producer&#13;
prices which are net of import taxes, as shown in Table 3.1 in&#13;
Chapter 3.&#13;
(iii) For decomposition of value added, it is sufficient to use the&#13;
estimates for (v) without recomputing them in terms of producer&#13;
prices in the strict sense (i.e., net of import tax on Mj).&#13;
C. Construction of Trade Price Indices&#13;
There are no sectorally arranged trade (i.e., import and export)&#13;
price indices available in Turkey which could be used in the present study.&#13;
Consequently, a special effort was required to construct sectoral trade price&#13;
indices (at a 25 sector level of aggregation, as defined in Table A.2.1) to&#13;
deflate current price sectoral trade data to constant domestic prices.       The&#13;
empirical work undertaken in this context is outlined as follows:&#13;
(i)   The  year  1963 was   taken  as  the base   period   in  the  original&#13;
calculation of sectoral average trade price indices, but subsequently the&#13;
base  was  switched   to  1968.    In  view  of  the  continually   shifting&#13;
composition of trade (imports, in particular) during 1953-73, the year&#13;
1963 represents a more reasonable mid-point than the other benchmark&#13;
periods. The selection of 1963, which had a relatively strong balance of&#13;
payments, also makes it possible to contrast the characteristics of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
unplanned and planned eras of 1953-63 and 1963-73, respectively.&#13;
(ii) After the establishment of the base 1963, the next step was to&#13;
select two separate samples of commodities for the imports and exports of&#13;
each international sector in the I-0 system. The commodities included in&#13;
the samples were determined on two practical grounds: (1) the availability&#13;
of the quantity and value statistics at the commodity level in all&#13;
benchmark years; and (2) their relative importance in sectoral trade in&#13;
the larger segment of the period 1953-73.       The commodity breakdown of&#13;
sectoral imports and exports of the 1963 I-0 table (in Chakraverti et al&#13;
(1970)), and the Ul!l Yearbooks of International Trade Statistics provided&#13;
helpful information at this point (see Tables A.2.6 and A.2.7).&#13;
(iii) The price indices for specific commodity imports (c.i.f.) and&#13;
exports (f.o.b.) incorporated in the sectoral samples were calculated in&#13;
terms of their unit: values with the base 1963, using Turkey's tables in&#13;
the UN Yearbooks of International Trade Statistics, for the benchmark&#13;
years 1953, 1958, 19168 and 1973. The years 1953 and 1958 represent three-&#13;
year averages for 1952-54 and 1957-59, respectively, in order to smooth&#13;
out the conjunctural variations in these subperiods. The US dollar values&#13;
of the international trade data were converted to local currency values&#13;
(i.e., Turkish lira) at the prevailing official exchange rates. For 1973,&#13;
the existence of multiple exchange rates was taken into account in view of&#13;
the State Institute of Statistics, (SIS) foreign trade data 1/&#13;
(iv) The average import and export price indices were calculated for&#13;
sectoral samples using the 1963 relative weights (with the Laspeyres&#13;
method), but were sritched to the base year 1968, which is the constant-&#13;

price reference year in the main study.&#13;
(v)   In sectors where information on commodlty trade was limited and/or&#13;
inconsistent, World Bank price indices for world exports of minerals and&#13;
manufactured goods were used. l The Bank international price indices are&#13;
based on current US dollar values, and, therefore, had to be adjusted for&#13;
changes in Turkish foreign exchange rates during 1953-73.       Because the&#13;
World Bank manufactured trade prices are adjusted for freight charges from&#13;
developed to developing countries, they could be directly used in the&#13;
calculation of Turkey's import price indices in manufacturing sectors&#13;
lacking adequate price data.&#13;
(vi) While the use of c.i.f. prices for imports is consistent with the&#13;
Turkish I-0 conventions, the f.o.b. price indices for sectoral commodity&#13;
exports needed to be adjusted for differences in f.o.b. and ex-factory&#13;
prices.   As a result of the lack of readily available data on export&#13;
subsidies, and to avoid additional cumbersome work, it was assumed that&#13;
the long-term movements of the domestic f.o.b. and ex-factory prices were&#13;
approximately the same at the sector level during the time period of this&#13;
analysis.   Thus, the domestic f.o.b. price indices were used to deflate&#13;
commodity export vectors in the current-price 1-0 tables.&#13;
(vii) The current values of invisible imports were deflated to constant&#13;
prices by the World Bank price index for manufactured goods trade.&#13;
However, the deflation of the invisible service exports in the 1-0 tables&#13;
required two types of treatment for: (1) distributional (mainly, trade and&#13;
transport) margins on commodity exports; and (2) direct service exports.&#13;
For the first part, the economy-wide average (commodity) f.o.b. price&#13;
See World Bank (1975), "Price Forecasts for Major Primary Commodities,"&#13;
Tables 11 and 17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
index was used.   Second, the direct service exports were deflated by the&#13;
Bank price index used for Invisible imports.&#13;
(viii)   To fill various small gaps in trade price statistics, available&#13;
expert judgment was used (e.g., the minor account of electricity trade in&#13;
1973).   Tables A..2.3 and A.2.4 list the results of empirical work on the&#13;
construction of trade price indices, while Tables A.2.6 and A.2.7 present&#13;
the base period weights of 1963 for commodity imports and exports in&#13;
individual sectors,&#13;
D. Construction of Price Indices for Production and Supply&#13;
The price indices for production (or output) and supply at the 25&#13;
sector level were constructed for the deflation of the 1963 and 1973 I-0&#13;
tables into 1968 constant prices.    The sectoral production estimates for the&#13;
benchmark years 1953 and 1958 were derived primarily from the data expressed&#13;
in 1968 prices, and thLus required no special work on production prices.&#13;
For the years 1963 and 1973, the main sources of production price&#13;
data were (1) the new Wholesale Price Index (new WPI) of the Ministry of&#13;
Commerce and SIS,1/ and (2) the sectoral value added deflators used in the&#13;
national accounts worked out by the SIS. While the first source was used in&#13;
estimating the prices of agricultural and industrial production (with some&#13;
adjustments for the year 1973), the second source was used to estimate the&#13;
service sectors' prices.  As Indicated above, the gross production price (Pi)&#13;
is essentially a comlposite price Index which defines the price of production&#13;
Xi including import taxes on M1 . Consequently, the construction of this index&#13;
involved several steps as follows:&#13;
(i)   Determination of the sectoral production figures net of import taxes&#13;
See Gocmencelebi (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
in current price I-0 tables that were rearranged at the 25 sector level of&#13;
aggregation;&#13;
(ii) Estimation of price indices for sectoral production net of Import&#13;
taxes (from the new WPI and GDP deflator series);&#13;
(iil) Deflation of sectoral production data, net of import taxes, by price&#13;
indices estimated in step (ii) into 1968 constant prices;&#13;
(iv) Estimation of sectoral import taxes in 1968 prices, using 1968 tax&#13;
rates on deflated sectoral imports;&#13;
(v)   Calculation of the 1968 constant price value of Xi by adding the&#13;
reestimated import taxes (in 1968 prices) to the deflated net production&#13;
figures determined in step (iii); and&#13;
(vi)  Estimation of the gross production price (Pi) on the basis of the&#13;
current price and constant price value of Xi        After the estimation of&#13;
the price index (pt) , the sectoral supply price (Pt) was determined in a&#13;
manner shown in subsection B in this annex, using Equation (4). The&#13;
results are listed in Table A.2.5.&#13;
Although the use of the United Nations ISIC sectoral classification&#13;
in the new WPI, unlike the other WPIs available in Turkey, facilitates the&#13;
construction of production price deflators for I-0 studies, the new WPI&#13;
estimates are not realistic in some periods during which substantial price&#13;
changes took place in the economy. In particular, for the period 1972-73, the&#13;
new WPI data does not adequately reflect the increases that actually occurred&#13;
in industrial prices. As a result, it underestimates the rise in the general&#13;
price  level.    The alternative   price  estimates  for this   period  are  the&#13;
following:&#13;

The 1973 estimates of the new WPI for manufacturing subsectors have&#13;
been adjusted upwards on the basis of various price data in order to&#13;
approximate the 1968 sectoral value added estimates of the SIS by the double&#13;
deflation of the 1973 I-0 table. The deflated aggregates of this table are&#13;
compared with the estimates of official national accounts in the main text in&#13;

            Sources of industrial growth and structural
            change : the case of Turkey
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study provides an empirical
            analysis of the sources of Turkey's growth and
            structural change since the 1950s, and considers the
            prospects for its transition from and inward-looking
            development strategy to trade-oriented growth in the 1980s.
            The paper discusses the major planning issues for improved
            adjustment to current domestic and international economic
            problems, with special attention to the role of
            Turkey's public and private sectors in the
            industrialization process. As part of a project on
            industrialization in selected semi-industrial countries, the
            study also compares Turkey's experience with those of
            other countries.
