  The differences between growth rates in the&#13;

need for policy changes. The low-growth path&#13;
would mean economic and social conditions for&#13;

change their policies. Concerted action will make&#13;
adjustment easier for all. Countries need to agree&#13;

proved productivity owing to technological                             a little higher than during the early 1980s, that is&#13;

Note: Real GDP growth is the sum of the contributions from total factor input growth and total factor productivity growth. The closer a point isto&#13;
the total factor productivity growth axis, the greater the relative contribution of productivity to real GDP growth. As one moves horizontally&#13;
toward the total factor input growth axis, the relative contribution of productivity to real GDP growth falls and that of factor inputs rises.&#13;

      Box 5.6       Alternative outward-oriented policies&#13;
     Ideally, the shift to an outward-oriented strategy from                 ample, that effective rates of protection ranged from&#13;
     an inward-oriented one can best be accomplished by                      -38 to 135 percent for eleven sectors in 1978, although&#13;
     removing existing trade barriers, devaluing the ex-                     average effective rates of protection did not signifi-&#13;

     oping countries-including, for example, the Republic                    the antiexport bias, they have sometimes been cap-&#13;
     of Korea, Brazil, and Mexico-have used export incen-                    tured by selective interests. Third, if import subsidies&#13;
     tives to offset bias against exports without dismantling                are used through preferential loans at below-market&#13;
     all of their import barriers and without devaluing their                rates, the choice of production technique may also be&#13;

       There are several ways to justify this approach. First,               employment. Finally, using import tariffs and export&#13;
     devaluations are feared because they may be inflation-                  subsidies puts a heavy strain on the government's ad-&#13;
     ary. Compared with import restrictions, however, it is                  ministrative machinery and encourages evasion, rent&#13;
     unclear whether this is so. Import prices under protec-                 seeking, and other directly unproductive profit-&#13;
     tion already reflect scarcity premiums, which the de-                   seeking activities (Box 4.7 in Chapter 4).&#13;
     valuation could simply cut into. Second, where import                      In any event, the alternative route to outward orien-&#13;
     tariffs rather than quantitative restrictions are used, the             tation in trade-subsidizing exports-faces two prob-&#13;
     loss of fiscal revenue in shifting to outward orientation               lems. First, where the overvaluation of exchange rate&#13;
     may be a problem for some governments. Third, im-                       caused by high import protection is large, as in Brazil&#13;
      port tariffs and quantitative restrictions can be used                 and Mexico, the export subsidies required to offset the&#13;
      selectively, which stimulates focused resistance to their              antiexport bias are simply too great. Second, subsidies&#13;

        Empirical studies, however, underscore the folly of                  ject to countervailing duties in some industrial coun-&#13;

coverage ratios (the sum of the value of a country's import groups affected by NTBs divided by the total value of its imports of thesegroups) have&#13;
been computed using 1981 import trade weights. Computations have been made at the tariff-line level and results aggregated to relevant product&#13;
group levels. The data cover a broad range of NTBs, including pars-tariff measures (for example, variable levies, seasonal tariffs, and countervail-&#13;
ing and antidumping duties), quantitative restrictions (including prohibitions, quotas, nonautomatic licensing, state monopolies, voluntary&#13;
export restraints, and restraints under MFA and similar textile arrangements), import surveillance (including automatic licensing), and price&#13;
control measures. Standards to comply with health and technical regulations as well as excise taxes are not included because the data base&#13;
information coverage is not even for all countries. The industrial market economies covered are Austria, Canada, EC (excluding Portugal and&#13;
Spain), Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States.&#13;

&amp;#12;there has actually been a decrease in trade between         special and differential treatment. Perhaps, in the face&#13;
ACP countries and the EC. In the pre-LomÃ© period            of rising protectionism in the industrial countries, the&#13;
1970-75, the ACP share of EC imports from the devel-        very existence of an accord which promotes trade pro-&#13;
oping countries was 20.5 percent. In 1975-84 the ACP        vides policymakers with a lever against future protec-&#13;
share dropped to 16.6 percent. When oil exports are         tionist demands in the EC.&#13;
discounted, no significant change is found in the&#13;
growth of trade between the ACP countries and the EC&#13;
(see Box table 9.2B).&#13;
  Although the ACP countries as a group have not&#13;
done better under the LomÃ©, there have been gains at&#13;
the margin. Among those countries which were "non-&#13;
associated" with EC members before the convention,&#13;
there was an increase in ACP imports.                       Box table 9.2B Trade shares: the EC and the ACP&#13;

  group a country has been placed in on&#13;
  the basis of its GNP per capita and, in&#13;
  some instances, its distinguishing eco-&#13;
  noniic characteristics. For example, all&#13;
  low-income economies, those with a&#13;
  GNP per capita of $400 and less (in&#13;
  1985), are colored yellow. The groups&#13;
  are the same as those used in the 33&#13;

 MANY FACTORS OTHER THAN TRADE POLICY affect the ability of a country to&#13;
 industrialize. Among them are its size, natural resources, and the skills of its&#13;
 people; the stability of its government and institutions and their ability to&#13;
 promote change; and the government's fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate&#13;
 policies. Yet the role played by foreign trade in the process of a country's&#13;
 industrialization, the theme of this tenth annual World Development Report, is&#13;
crucial, and empirical studies over the past thirty years make it possible to&#13;
draw useful lessons concerning the advantages and disadvantages of differ-&#13;
ent trade policies. The importance of the subject is magnified in today's&#13;
economic climate by the continued sluggish growth worldwide and the&#13;
rising protectionism in industrial countries. These factors threaten the pros-&#13;
pects of developing countries, many of which have begun to reduce their&#13;
trade barriers from very high levels to expand exports and obtain net earn-&#13;
ings of foreign exchange that are needed to maintain adequate growth and&#13;
to service external debt.&#13;
   The Report considers four principal sets of issues: LI What conditions in&#13;
the world economy support the industrialization efforts of the developing&#13;
countries? What factors will influence the growth of the global economy in&#13;
the long term? LI What is the role of government in bringing about efficient&#13;
industrialization? What are the effects of different trade strategies on indus-&#13;
trialization? LI How have countries accomplished reform of their trade and&#13;
other policies in such a way as to lead to efficient industrialization? How&#13;
should trade liberalization measures be coordinated with appropriate&#13;
macroeconomic policies in order for trade liberalization to have the desired&#13;
effects? LI How can developing countries respond to the growing pressure&#13;
on the governments of industrial countries to protect their domestic indus-&#13;
tries? What underlies the growing threat of protectionism in the face of clear&#13;
historical evidence that the consequences are damaging to all parties?&#13;
   Treatment of these issues, enriched by frequent comparisons of the expe-&#13;
riences of many countries, leads to consideration of the new multilateral&#13;
trade negotiationsthe Uruguay Roundthat have begun under the auspi-&#13;
ces of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Report discusses the&#13;
stake of the developing countries in these negotiations and the issues rele-&#13;
vant to their progress toward industrialization.&#13;

            This report is the tenth in the annual
            series assessing development issues. Part one reviews recent
            trends in the world economy and their implications for the
            future prospects of developing countries. It stresses that
            better economic performance is possible in both industrial
            and developing countries, provided the commitment to
            economic policy reforms is maintained and reinforced. In
            regard to the external debt issues, the report argues for
            strengthened cooperation among industrial countries in the
            sphere of macroeconomic policy to promote smooth adjustment
            to the imbalances caused by external payments (in developing
            countries). Part two reviews and evaluates the varied
            experience with government policies in support of
            industrialization. Emphasis is placed on policies which
            affect both the efficiency and sustainability of industrial
            transformation, especially in the sphere of foreign trade.
            The report finds that developing countries which followed
            policies that promoted the integration of their industrial
            sector into the international economy through trade have
            fared better than those which insulated themselves from
            international competition.
