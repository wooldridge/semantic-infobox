COLOMBO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:        Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka&#13;
Beneficiaries:   Colombo Municipal Council (CMC)&#13;
National Water Supply and Drainage (NWSDB)&#13;
Urbar Development Authority (UDA)&#13;
Amount:          SDR 24.8 million (US$39.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:           Standard, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Onlending Terms: The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) would onlend part of the credit&#13;
proceeds to CMC and NWSDB on a variable rate basis not below the average&#13;
weighted deposit rate on interest bearing deposits of domestic commercial&#13;
banks and adjustable every six months, repayable over 20 years, including 6&#13;
years of grace. GOSL would bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
Proiect&#13;
Description:     The project would support progress toward a sustainable environment for the&#13;
long term economic and social development of the Colombo Metropolitan&#13;
Area (CMA). In particular, the project would focus on improving solid waste&#13;
services, controlling surface- and groundwater contamination from wastewater&#13;
discharge, and building up the capabilities of the local governments in&#13;
municipal waste management. The project would also assist in promoting&#13;
private sector participation in environment-related operations. The project&#13;
would finance (a) construction of a sanitary landfill and compost facilities to&#13;
replace open dumps, and equipment for hospital wastes collection, transport&#13;
and disposal; (b) wastewater collection systems in two industrial zones; (c)&#13;
wastewater pollution abatement measures in the Beira Lake catchment area;&#13;
and (d) technical assistance.&#13;
Project Benefits:   The project addresses the underlying causes of environmental degradation in&#13;
the CMA and will benefit over 3 million people who reside in or commute to&#13;
the project area. The replacement of open dumps with controlled sanitary&#13;
landfill will eliminate contamination of surface and ground water from open&#13;
dump seepage or leachates, improve urban environmental conditions and&#13;
landscape aesthetics. Improved management of hospital wastes through&#13;
specialized collection and safe disposal will lower public health impacts of&#13;
uncontrolled disposal of infectious and pathological wastes. The two&#13;
industrial areas at Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela account for about 60% of&#13;
water-polluting industries in the CMA; the project-supported sewerage&#13;
investments would therefore lead to a significant reduction in the overall&#13;
pollution contribution of the industrial sector and a general improvement in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
population health in the areas concerned. The interventions in the Beira Lake&#13;
catchment will help reduce associated environmental and health hazards and&#13;
open the way for environmentally sustainable development of the lake's&#13;
surrounding area in the longer term. Besides the above direct benefits, the&#13;
project would serve to catalyze private participation in the delivery of critical&#13;
urban infrastructure services traditionally undertaken by the public sector.&#13;
This is expected to contribute to increased service coverage, improved service&#13;
quality and efficiency. The project would also have a significant&#13;
demonstration effect to sensitize other urban authorities to adopt better&#13;
managed and environmentally sound wastes management systems.&#13;
Prgject Risks:    Potential project risks are: (a) shortfalls in cost recovery to sustain the&#13;
operations of the project supported investments; (b) weak enforcement of&#13;
industrial wastewater discharge standards, which would reduce pressure on&#13;
industries to utilize the joint wastewater collection and treatment systems; and&#13;
(c) lack of adequate response from the private sector for the two wastewater&#13;
treatment plants. These risks have been recognized and suitable safeguards&#13;
have been incorporated in the project implementation as detailed below.&#13;
Cost Recovery. To sustain the operations of project facilities agreement has&#13;
been reached on the mechanisms for setting up dedicated sources of funds for&#13;
the above operations and on cost recovery targets satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Enforcement. To step up enforcement, GOSL has committed to implementing&#13;
a time-bound compliance program for the two industrial areas. Under this&#13;
program, the Central Environmental Authority, NWSDB and each of the&#13;
targeted industries will enter into an agreement confirming that each industrial&#13;
entity will comply with established effluent discharge standards through using&#13;
the proposed joint treatment facilities or its own captive treatment plant. All&#13;
agreements would be concluded by June 1997.&#13;
Financing of Wastewater Treatment Plants. To minimize the risk that private&#13;
sector interest may not materialize in a time frame commensurate with the&#13;
implementation of the project, GOSL will implement a program of specific&#13;
actions aimed at concluding contractual agreements with private sponsors by&#13;
March 1997. International consultants will be mobilized in October 1995 to&#13;
assist in the preparation of solicitation packages and evaluation of proposals.&#13;
No withdrawals will be allowed with respect to the wastewater collection&#13;
works until financing arrangements satisfactory to IDA for the construction of&#13;
the two wastewater treatment plants have been concluded. In the event that&#13;
private sector BOO/BOT arrangements fail to develop, GOSL will arrange&#13;
funds from alternative sources for the construction of the wastewater&#13;
treatment plants.&#13;

COLOMBO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. THE COLOMBO URBAN ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. Socioeconomic Setting&#13;
1.1  Sri Lanka has a richly varied natural resource base, a moderately expanding population&#13;
covered by extensive social services and an adult literacy rate of almost 90%. With such an&#13;
economic infrastructure and human resource base, the Govemment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) is&#13;
gearing up to propel the economy into the mainstream of growth by fostering private sector-led&#13;
and environmentally friendly industrial growth, stimulating agriculture to diversify into new&#13;
crops and export-oriented products, and consolidating Sri Lanka's natural, strategic position by&#13;
developing the Colombo port into a competitive regional transshipment center.&#13;
1.2 The Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA), which comprises the Colombo Municipal&#13;
Council (CMC) and 30 othe, local authorities in the Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha Districts&#13;
of the Westem Province, is the most developed region in Sri Lanka (see IBRD Map 26954).&#13;
With over four million inhabitanits, the CMA contains a quarter of Sri Lanka's total population,&#13;
accounts for above 70% of the country's industrial activities, and generates over 40% of the&#13;
island's gross domestic product (GDP). This concentration of population, industrial and&#13;
commercial activities in about 5% of the total land area of Sri Lanka, places a severe strain on&#13;
the existing municipal infrastructure. Notwithstanding the Govemment's preference for a more&#13;
balanced regional development, most of the new industrial growth can be expected to be sited&#13;
in the CMA, which is already bearing the brunt of existing industrial and urban pollution.&#13;
Recognizing environmental improvement as an essential part of economic development,&#13;
implementation of adequate environmental management programs to remedy and prevent the&#13;
adverse effects of urban and industrial growth on the environment in the CMA is on the top of&#13;
GOSL's environmental agenda.&#13;
B. Regulatory and Institutional Framework for Environmental Management&#13;
1.3  In recent years, GOSL has taken a series of legislative initiatives toward protecting the&#13;
environment. The National Environmental Act of 1980 establishes a comprehensive national&#13;
environmental policy. In 1982, GOSL created the Central Environmental Authority (CEA)&#13;
with policy and regulatory functions. Under the National Environmental (Amendment) Act of&#13;
1988, three new instruments were introduced for enhancing environmental protection; these are&#13;
the requirement of Initial Environmental Examination and Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
for approval of projects, the designation of environmental protection areas, and the&#13;
environmental protection license scheme to enforce industrial effluents discharge standards.&#13;
The National Environment (Protection and Quality) Regulations of 1990 mainly deals with&#13;
industrial pollution control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.4 The institutional framework for environmental management in Sri Lanka is still evolving.&#13;
CEA, which functions under the new Ministry of Transport, Highways, Environment and&#13;
Women's Affairs, is the central agency with a policy and regulatory mandate. The National&#13;
Environmental Steering Committee (NESC, established in 1990) coordinates and oversees the&#13;
implementation of all environment-related programs, plans and projects. The members of the&#13;
NESC include the secretaries/heads of all relevant ministries and agencies. Besides CEA and&#13;
the NESC, a large number of national agencies are entrusted with specific responsibilities with&#13;
respect to the various environmental segments, these include, among others, the Coast&#13;
Conservation Department, the Forest Department, the Department of Wildlife Conservation,&#13;
the Irrigation Department, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), and the&#13;
Urban Development Authority (UDA). The municipal, urban and local govemment&#13;
admninistrations' are the basic units responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental&#13;
regulations and standards within their respective jurisdictions.&#13;
C. Environmental Conditions in Colombo&#13;
1.5  The environmental degradation in the CMA derives largely from the poor management&#13;
of solid and hazardous wastes, and uncontrolled discharge of domestic and industrial&#13;
wastewater into the area's water courses, which are in tum attributable to the lack of adequate&#13;
urban infrastructure and effective enforcement of environmental regulations.&#13;
1.6    Municipal Solid Waste. According to the existing legislation, the overall responsibility&#13;
for municipal solid waste collection and disposal rests with each local administration. The solid&#13;
waste management practices in the various jurisdictions comprising the CMA differ greatly.&#13;
Regular solid waste collection systems exist in the CMC, Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal&#13;
Council (Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia MC), Moratuwa Urban Council (Moratuwa UC) and the Kotte&#13;
Urban Council (Kotte UC); however, in some of the smaller jurisdictions, a solid waste&#13;
collection system is virtually non-existent. Municipal solid waste in the CMA is presently&#13;
collected at the rate of about 1I,100 tons per day (tpd), of which about 700 tpd is by the CMC.&#13;
The ratio of waste collected to waste generated ranges from about 90% in the CMC to as little&#13;
as 5% in some of the smaller local authorities (LAs).&#13;
1.7  Presently, CMC is the only jurisdiction in the CMA that has an organized solid waste&#13;
management system, with about 1,000 container collection points providing storage of waste&#13;
prior to collection for disposal. Currently, waste collected in the CMC is deposited at a&#13;
disposal site at Wellampitiya. During the development of the site, little preparatory work was&#13;
undertaken to contain surface water, control leachate or prevent gas. Consequently, operation&#13;
of the site has caused contamination of the local aquifer. Furthermore, the site has already&#13;
reached its capacity. Thus, CMC is in urgent need of a new sanitary landfill site to avoid the&#13;
altemative of using open dumps.&#13;
1.8  Within the other LAs, waste collection points generally are little more than open patches&#13;
of ground where waste is dumped, requiring hand-loading onto secondary transport. Solid&#13;
There are three types of local government adrninistrations: Municipal Council for major cities, Urban Council for medium-sized ones,&#13;
and Local Authority for small jurisdictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
waste from Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia MC, Moratuwa UC and Kotte UC are disposed of at 15&#13;
dumping sites, all operated in an uncontrolled manner.&#13;
1.9  Hospital 7aste. Current practice of disposing medical waste is not environmentally&#13;
acceptable. Colombo's 20-odd hospitals generate about 4 tons per day of waste, of which&#13;
about 3 tons per Jay are clinical wastes. Presently, infectious clinical wastes are deposited&#13;
together with non-clinical wastes in regular trash containers without special lids to keep them&#13;
securely fastened. From that point, the containers are transported in open trolleys to an open&#13;
container il. the hospital where they are kept awaiting pick-up through the CMC's waste&#13;
collection service. This indiscriminate mixing poses a serious health hazard at each stage of&#13;
collection and storage within the hospital, and of transport and disposal in landfills and open&#13;
dumps.&#13;
1.10 Wastewater Disposal and Sanitation. The CMC and part of the neighboring Dehiwala-&#13;
Mt. Lavir. ia MC and ''Colonnawa Urban Council are the only major areas in Sri Lanka with a&#13;
central sewerage system. Within the sewered area, only about 60% of the population is&#13;
connected; 25% utilize septic tanks or pit latrines; the remaining 15% has no sanitation&#13;
facilities at all. Most industries discharge their wastewater without any treatment into surface&#13;
waters. The CMC sewerage system comprises a network of 265 km of gravity mains, 20 km&#13;
of force mains and 13 pumping stations. The collected sewerage is discharged without any&#13;
treatment into the Indian Ocean through two ocean outfalls. The existing sewerage system is&#13;
not functioning properly due to lack of maintenance, under-capacity and illegal connections.&#13;
Most of the gravity sewers were built in the early decades of the century and are reportedly&#13;
subject to periodic collapse. As a result, the discharge and seepage of sewage, industrial&#13;
wastewater and polluted stormwater cause serious pollution of the surface waters and&#13;
groundwater in the CMA and of the coastal marine waters.&#13;
1.11 Industrial Wastewater Pollution. Colombo and the adjoining areas represent the largest&#13;
concentration of industrial facilities in Sri Lanka. For nearly two decades industries have been&#13;
encouraged to grow, without concomitant attention being paid to management of industrial&#13;
pollution. The resultant industrial wastewater pollution has been especially severe in the&#13;
Ratmalana/Moratuwa area which has over 225 industrial facilities intermixed with residential&#13;
and commercial establishments, with a total population of about 350,000. Most of the&#13;
industries discharge their effluents without any treatment into nearby drainage systems;&#13;
domestic wastewater from flush toilets is directed to septic tanks and soakage pits. Pressure&#13;
from the expanding population has forced residents to construct wells adjacent to existing&#13;
septic tanks, often in violation of minimum safe distances required by planning agencies. The&#13;
high water table in much of the area further aggravates this problem, and fecal contamination&#13;
of wells is becoming more evident. Two water bodies, Lunawa Lagoon and Bolgoda Lake are&#13;
in the area. Because of the continual discharge of wastewater into its tributaries, Lunawa&#13;
Lagoon, which supported a significant fisheries industry a decade ago, is totally devoid of&#13;
aquatic life today. Although Bolgoda Lake has not degraded to the sane extent, there is&#13;
increasing concern that the long term effects of continued industrial wastewater discharge into&#13;
it will seriously compromise its economic and ecological value.&#13;
1.12 Beira Lake. Beira Lake, a distinctive landmark in the center of Colombo and once an&#13;
economic and aesthetic asset, is now a polluted water body and a public health hazard. The&#13;
lake has a surface area of 65 hectares (ha.) and is situated in a catchment area of about 448 ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Having no natural tributaries of its own, the lake's main source of renewal comes from the&#13;
runoff waters of its catchment. Its u-shaped configuration gives the lake an exceptionally long&#13;
shoreline, increasing its susceptibility to runoff from its overall catchment area as well as from&#13;
inappropriate use of the shoreline. Shoreline uses include industry, warehousing, shipping,&#13;
marine repair facilities, government offices, hotels, public open space, recreational areas, and&#13;
religious centers. Nearly 500 low-income housing units with a population of about 2,400 are&#13;
located along the shore. Large portions of the shoreline have been abused by indiscriminate&#13;
waste disposal.&#13;
1.13 The lake's water quality is very poor, with high concentrations of organic materials and&#13;
other nutrients, high turbidity and algal growth, wide fluctuations of dissolved oxygen, and high&#13;
counts of fecal coliform bacteria from domestic sewage. Pollution sources consist principally&#13;
of stormwater runoff containing illegal discharges of domestic sewage and industrial&#13;
wastewater, and sewage and solid waste from shanty settlements. Over one thousand&#13;
stormwater outfalls open into the lake, carrying all forms of urban waste. Raw sewage from&#13;
overflows in the sewerage network and from unauthorized connections of sewers and septic&#13;
tanks to storm drains further contaminates the lake.&#13;
1.14 To reverse the effects of environmental degradation, restoration of the Beira Lake has&#13;
been accorded high priority by GOSL. Various studies regarding the water quality of the lake,&#13;
sources of pollution and options for mitigation have been carried out in recent years. During&#13;
the preparation of the Colombo Environmental Management Strategy and Action Plan (para.&#13;
1.16), a comprehensive study funded by the Canadian Intemational Development Agency&#13;
(CIDA) was carried out with the objective of formulating a series of practical interventions.&#13;
The study recommended a 10-year, two-phase restoration strategy. Phase I would focus on&#13;
reduction of pollutant loadings from the Beira Lake catchment area; Phase I would aim at&#13;
accelerating the lake's restoration using three in-lake restoration techniques: dredging,&#13;
filtration of algae, and stocking of algae-eating fish. The proposed project would finance phase&#13;
I interventions.&#13;
D. Govemment Strategy&#13;
1 .15 National Environmental Action Plan. With the foresight that Sri Lanka has the unique&#13;
opportunity to pursue economic development in an ecologically sensitive manner, GOSL issued&#13;
a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 1991, with the objective to set a framework&#13;
for the enhancement of sustainable development and to mitigate emerging pollution problems&#13;
and environmental degradation. The areas of environmental concem addressed under the&#13;
NEAP include: land and water resources, forestry, biodiversity and wildlife, urban and&#13;
industrial pollution, energy, and institutional capacity. The NEAP has identified the following&#13;
priority actions which bear on the environment in the Colombo metropolitan area:&#13;
*  preparation of a wastewater and sanitation master plan and a long-term solid waste&#13;
management strategy for Greater Colombo,&#13;
*  preparation of a program for the rehabilitation of Colombo's natural drainage&#13;
system, focusing on restoration of the Beira Lake, and addressing marsh filling and&#13;
stream and canal reservation settlement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
*  preparation of a program for continuous monitoring of the level of pollution in&#13;
selected rivers and education of the public on the adverse effects of pollutant build-&#13;
up in water bodies; and&#13;
*  preparation of a Water Resources Master Plan addressing the present and future&#13;
environmental issues relating to water resources utilization.&#13;
1.16 Colombo Environmental Management Strategy and Action Plan. Stemming from the&#13;
NEAP, GOSL, with assistance from the Metropolitan Environmental Improvement Program&#13;
(MEIP), formulated a comprehensive environmental management strategy (EMS) for Greater&#13;
Colombo. Drawing extensively upon a wide range of excellent documentation available on Sri&#13;
Lanka's environment, the Colombo EMS documented major environmental problems and their&#13;
underlying causes, assessed Sri Lanka's environmental policies and institutional capabilities for&#13;
addressing them, recommended areas for improvement, and proposed a 10 -year program of&#13;
specific environmental interventions. The proposed project is based upon the prioritized&#13;
remedial actions proposed in the EMS.&#13;
1 17 Current Constraints. While the existing legislation covers the entire range of&#13;
environmental concems, there is still a large lack of adequate implementation and enforcement.&#13;
Apart from the shortage of funds for investment in urban infrastructure, the lack of institutional&#13;
capabilities at the CEA to enforce the existing regulations and standards, and insufficient&#13;
attention on the part of local govemments to adopting adequate cost recovery measures are&#13;
constraints to implementation of environmental management programs. To help address the&#13;
above constraints, the proposed project would assist CMC and other local authorities to&#13;
operationalize sound solid waste management systems and seek private sector participation&#13;
under concession agreements. The project would also provide technical assistance to&#13;
strengthen UDA's capability in integrated urban planning, with a particular focus on&#13;
environmental planning and management. Institution building technical assistance to CEA&#13;
would be provided in the proposed Sri Lanka Environmental Action 1 Project which is under&#13;
preparation.&#13;
E. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.18 The proposed operation is consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Sri&#13;
Lanka. The strategy discussed by the Board on December 10, 1992 seeks and supports&#13;
reforms by GOSL to (a) improve the climate for private initiatives and for export growth and&#13;
diversification; (b) improve public sector management of human and physical resources with a&#13;
view to preserving the country's outstanding social achievements and encouraging private&#13;
sector participation; and (c) strengthen public finances through containment of current&#13;
expenditures and a more rapid divestiture of Govemment holdings in public enterprises. The&#13;
strategy also supports programs that contribute to improved environmental management and&#13;
long-term sustainable economic development, particularly through lending support in urban&#13;
infrastructure. The proposed project responds to GOSL's priority for addressing emerging&#13;
environmental problems related to the concentration of economic activity in and around&#13;
Colombo. The project complements and reinforces the Bank group operations such as the&#13;
Colombo Urban Transport Project (Cr. 2495-CE) and the proposed Sri Lanka Environmental&#13;
Action I Project in their institutional support for key agencies involved in environmental&#13;
protection activities. The project would also support GOSL's effort to seek private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
participation in delivering urban infrastructure services under Build, Operate and Own (BOO)&#13;
and concession agreements. IDA is well-placed to provide assistance because of its&#13;
involvement in the formulation of the NEAP and Colombo EMS and its ability to catalyze,&#13;
through policy dialogue with the Government and project financing, the implementation of&#13;
interventions needed to improve waste management and safeguard the environment.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1  The overall objective of the project is to contribute to a sustainable environment for the&#13;
long term economic and social development of the CMA. Specific objectives of the project are&#13;
to:&#13;
(a)   improve municipal solid waste management and services in the CMC and&#13;

manage municipal services in a sustainable, environmentally beneficial manner;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)    assist in mobilizing private participation in the development and operation of&#13;
urban infrastructure services.&#13;
B. Project Descrdtion&#13;
2.2 The project would comprise the following components:&#13;
(a)    Municipal Solid Waste Management (US$15.7 million) for:&#13;
(i)   construction of a sanitary landfill of 3.5 million cubic meters capacity at&#13;
Welisara to meet the disposal needs of CMC and 14 local authorities&#13;
located in the CMA;&#13;

landfill;&#13;
(iii)    provision of potable water supply and other infrastructure for the&#13;
community residing adjacent to the landfill site; and&#13;
(iv)    purchase of equipment and vehicles for safe collection, transport and&#13;
final disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
(b)   Wastewater Collection Systems (US$11.4 million) for construction of a sewer&#13;
network in each of the two industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela,&#13;
to collect and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two separate&#13;
wastewater treatment plants to be built and operated by the private sector in&#13;
parallel with the project.&#13;
(c)    Beira Lake Catchment Pollution Control (US$12.9 million) for:&#13;
(i)   interception of unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the&#13;
storm drainage system and connecting them to the existing sewerage&#13;
system; and&#13;
(ii)   reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning sewer lines,&#13;
rehabilitating pumping stations, and adding a sewer line along the&#13;
northwest bank of the East Lake.&#13;
(d)   Technical Assistance (US$9.0 million) consisting of:&#13;
(i)    project preparation assistance;&#13;
(ii)    proiect implementation support through consulting services to prepare&#13;
designs and bid documents, assist in bid evaluation and provide&#13;
construction supervision for the components (a), (b) and (c) above,&#13;
including consultancy services for the invitation and evaluation of&#13;
BOO/BOT proposals for the two wastewater treatment plants for&#13;
Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela;&#13;
(iii)   technical assistance to CMC and other LAs to improve solid waste&#13;
services through involving the private sector under concession&#13;
agreements and management contracts and implementing appropriate&#13;
cost recovery measures; and&#13;
(iv)    technical assistance to UDA to (a) strengthen its capabilities in&#13;
integrated urban planning through provision of consultancy services for&#13;
updating the Colombo Master Plan (prepared in 1978) and for the&#13;
preparation of a Trincomalee regional infrastructure development plan;&#13;
(b) establish a geographic information system (GIS) for Greater&#13;
Colombo to facilitate urban planning, infrastructure development and&#13;
construction, environmental management, and urban service&#13;
administration; (c) develop a long term solid waste disposal strategy for&#13;
the CMA; (d) implement a program to monitor the water quality of&#13;
stormwater outfalls open to the lake and the lake itself; (e) formulate&#13;
further restoration measures for the Beira Lake; and (f) carry out an&#13;
environmental public awareness program.&#13;
Full details of the project's physical components are given in Annexes I through 3 and&#13;
their geographic locations shown on Map IBRD 26954.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
C. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
2.3  GOSL, with the assistance of intemational and local consultants, have prepared (a)&#13;
feasibility study reports for the project's physical components; and (b) prequalification and bid&#13;
documents for the construction and operation of the sanitary landfill and compost facilities.&#13;
Prequalification of contractors for the landfill component is now underway; bids will be invited&#13;
in September 1995 and contracts will be awarded in March 1996. Terms of reference and&#13;
shortlists for project implementation support consultancies were agreed and proposals invited;&#13;
consultants are to be appointed in October 1995. Prior to the engagement of project&#13;
supervisory consultants discussed above, the consultant who prepared the feasibility study&#13;
report for the project's solid waste management component has been retained to assist with&#13;
evaluation of prequalification submissions and finalization of bid documents for the landfill&#13;
contracts. Agreed terms of reference for project implementation support and institution&#13;
building technical assistance are given in Annex 4.&#13;
D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.4  The project will have a significant positive impact on the environmental quality of the&#13;
Colombo metropolitan area. Project subcomponents are designed to upgrade the deteriorated&#13;
environmental conditions caused by deficient or non-existent collection and disposal systems&#13;
for municipal wastes, especially in relation to water pollution, public health and landscape&#13;
aesthetics.&#13;
2.5  Because the project involves construction of a major sanitary landfill, it is a category A&#13;
project under IDA's Operational Directive for environmental screening. As part of the project&#13;
preparation, a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposed sanitary landfill was&#13;
prepared by intemational consultants on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with IDA's&#13;
guidelines. Annex 5 provides the summary of the EIA report.&#13;
2.6  The landfill site at Welisara was chosen from a shortlist of six sites after detailed&#13;
evaluation. Located approximately 10 km north of central Colombo, the landfill site covers&#13;
approximately 50 hectares and is essentially flat with its elevation at sea level. The area is not&#13;
suitable for cropping because of salinity and does not contain flora and fauna of ecological&#13;
significance. More than 90% of the required land is owned by GOSL; population displacement&#13;
by the landfill is minimal, involving only one family who has accepted the compensation&#13;
package for resettlement. Potential significant negative environmental impacts pertain to: (a)&#13;
surface/ground water contamination which may be caused by improper handling of waste&#13;
construction materials during construction of the landfill site or escape of leachate during&#13;
operation; and (b) changes to the flood storage capacity of the catchment of the Kalu Oya river,&#13;
which may lead to increased flooding upstream and downstream of the landfill site. The EIA&#13;
fully addresses these potential impacts and recommends appropriate mitigation measures. The&#13;
design of the landfill will incorporate a range of environmental protection measures to ensure&#13;
that development and operation of the landfill site does not result in unacceptable residual&#13;
impact on the surrounding environment. These include engineering of containment of the site,&#13;
provision of a leachate collection and treatment system, bunding and provision of piped potable&#13;
water supplies to the local community. Taking into account the lack of local expertise in&#13;
modem sanitary landfills, construction and operation of the landfill and compost plant would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
procured through two linked contracts to be awarded to the same contractor (para 2.13).&#13;
Formal plans for site operation, environmental control and monitoring, and restoration will be&#13;
developed as part of the detailed design process to be carried out by the selected landfill&#13;
contractor. During negotiations, it was agreed that GOSL/CMC will implement or cause to be&#13;
implemented mitigation measures and a monitoring system for the landfill satisfactory to I)A.&#13;
2.7   To minimize negative impact due to the sitting and operation of the two wastewater&#13;
treatment plants (para. 2.2[b]) for which GOSL is seeking private sector financing, the&#13;
consultant .o be appointed under the project for assisting with the invitation and evaluation of&#13;
BOO/BOT proposals for the wastewater treatment plants will carry out the required&#13;
environment assessments under terms of references agreed with IDA.&#13;
E. Project Costs&#13;
2.8   Th~ total cost )f the project, including price and physical contingencies, duties and taxes,&#13;
and the project preparation advance, is estimated at US$49.0 million, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$20.9 million. Duties and taxes would amount to US$4.6 rnillion. Project&#13;
base cos.s are at December 1994 price levels. Physical contingencies of 15% are included fbr&#13;
ail project components. Price contingencies for foreign costs are based on an average annual&#13;
price ir.crease of 2.5% for 1995-2000. Price contingencies for local costs are based on a&#13;
projected annual inflation rate of 15% for 1995, declining to 7.5% by 1997 and thereafter.&#13;
Maintenance of purchasing power parity is assumed for exchange rate changes over the life of&#13;
the project. Total price contingencies amount to 9% of the base cost plus physical&#13;
contingencies. Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 2.1. Detailed project cost&#13;
estimates are provided in Annex 6.&#13;

F. Project Financing&#13;
2.9 The proposed IDA credit of US$39.0 million equivalent would finance the project's&#13;
foreign cost and 64% of the local cost, covering about 88% of the total project cost net of&#13;
duties and taxes. The remaining local cost of US$10.0 million equivalent would be met by&#13;
GOSL's budgetary allocations. The project's financing plan is shown in Table 2.2.&#13;

2.10  Up to now, financing for water supply and sanitation investments in Sri Lanka has&#13;
come mostly from multilateral and bilateral sources. Onlending interest rates were not set&#13;
according to the prevailing market rates in the country, partly because of the absence of long&#13;
term financial instruments in the local capital market. To promote a commercial orientation in&#13;
the operations of municipal services, the timing is considered appropriate to set onlending rates&#13;
that take account of market rates. However, intermediation costs in the incipient local market&#13;
are high (4 to 5 percentage points) due to inefficiencies and large provisions for bad loans. In&#13;
these circumstances, the average weighted deposit rate (AWDR) on interest bearing deposits&#13;
of the Greater Colombo branches of domestic commercial banks, which is published on a&#13;
weekly basis, provides the floor for onlending rates. GOSL would onlend part of the credit&#13;
proceeds to CMC and NWSDB for their respective components on a variable rate basis linked&#13;
to the AWDR and adjustable every six months, repayable over 20 years, including 6 years of&#13;
grace. GOSL would bear the foreign exchange risk. Regarding the Beira Lake catchment&#13;
pollution control component, UDA would execute this component on GOSL's behalf and&#13;
would maintain separate project accounts thereof The above terms will be incorporated in&#13;
separate implementation agreements (IA) to be executed between GOSL and each of the three&#13;
project implementing agencies. The effectiveness of lAs between GOSL and CMC/NWSDB/&#13;
UDA under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA are conditions of credit effectiveness.&#13;

Note: Figures in parentheses are respective amounts financed by the credit.&#13;
2.12   Goods and Works. Procurement of goods and works under the project will be in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits&#13;
(January 1995), using IDA's standard bid documents for procurement under ICB.&#13;
2.13   Construction and operation of the landfill and compost plant will be procured through&#13;
two separate but linked turnkey contracts. One contract (Contract A) comprises detailed&#13;
design and phased construction of the landfill site, compost plant and other associated facilities,&#13;
and procurement of mobile equipment required for the landfill operation; the second contract&#13;
(Contract B) will commence once initial construction is complete and the site is ready to&#13;
receive wastes and will include operation of the landfill site and progressive restoration of the&#13;
finished surface. These two contracts will be tendered under one package and awarded at the&#13;
same time to the same contractor following intemational competitive bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures. The credit would finance Contract A only; CMC and other participating local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
authorities would jointly meet the operating costs of the landfill under Contract B subject to the&#13;
contractor's meeting industry standard efficiency norms.&#13;
2.14   Construction of the wastewater collection systems would be bid under one single&#13;
responsibility contract following ICB. The sewerage works in the Beira Lake catchment area&#13;
would be procured under two single responsibility ICB packages. Contractors bidding for the&#13;
above works will be prequalified. Under ICB, qualifying domestic contractors will be eligible&#13;
for a margin of preference in the comparison of bids of 7.5%.&#13;
2.15   The proposed community infrastructure to be constructed under IDA financing&#13;
comprises mainly provision of piped potable water supply to the community residing adjacent&#13;
to the new landfill site, upgrading of local roads, and construction of a community center&#13;
complex. To involve the local community in the design and implementation of the&#13;
infrastructure and to provide income-generating opportunities, the above works, estimated to&#13;
cost US$0.9 million in aggregate, would be procured using procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.16  Equipment needed for the collection, transport and disposal of clinical waste and for&#13;
the geographic information system would be procured under ICB procedures.&#13;
2.17  Consultancy Services. Consultancy services financed by IDA would be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981), including use of the Bank's Standard&#13;
Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Selection of consultants for all assignments would&#13;
be from a shortlist agreed by IDA and under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
Procurement of services for the environmental public awareness program (mass media) would&#13;
follow procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
2.18  IDA's Prior Review. All goods contracts valued US$200,000 or more, works contracts&#13;
US$300,000 or more, consulting firm contracts US$100,000 or more, and individual&#13;
consultant contracts US$50,000 or more will be subject to prior review by IDA. This would&#13;
cover about 90% of procurement financed under the proposed credit.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
2.19  Disbursement under the proposed credit will be made against:&#13;
(a)    100% of foreign expenditures and 70% of local expenditures for the landfill&#13;
tumkey contract and other works procured under ICB;&#13;
(b)   70% of total expenditure for civil works procured locally;&#13;
(c)    100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory&#13;
costs) for good procured through ICB and 70% of local expenditures for items&#13;
procured locally;&#13;
(d)   100% of total expenditures for consultancy services, mass media and training;&#13;
and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(e)   the principal amount of the Project Preparation Advance withdrawn and&#13;
outstanding as of the effectiveness of the credit and all unpaid charges thereon.&#13;
To ensure construction of wastewater collection systems in Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela is&#13;
synchronized with that of the wastewater treatment plants, agreement was reached with GOSL/&#13;
NWSDB during negotiations that no withdrawals shall be made in respect of expenditures for&#13;
the wastewater collection works unless financing arrangements satisfactory to IDA for the&#13;
construction of t:le said wastewater treatment plants have been concluded.&#13;
2.20   To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account in US$ will be established in a local bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA with an authorized allocation of US$2.5 million equivalent, estimated on the&#13;
basis if four months' average expenditures. The authorized allocation would be limited to an&#13;
amount to US$1,700,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the credit plus the&#13;
total amount of all outstanding special commitments equals the equivalent of US$6,000,000 or&#13;
more. A'l disburserr ents will be made following standard IDA documentation requirements,&#13;
except for (a) contracts valued at US$300,000 or less for works, (b) contracts valued at&#13;
UJS$200,000 or less for goods, (c) consultants' contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
per contiact for firms and US$50,000 equivalent per contract for individuals, for which&#13;
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used. The project implementing agencies&#13;
will retain detailed documentation supporting SOEs for inspection by IDA supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
2.21   The disbursement schedule shown in Annex 7 is based on completion of the proposed&#13;
project by June 30, 2000. The credit closing date would be June 30, 2001. The total&#13;
disbursement period for the project is expected to be about six years after credit approval.&#13;
H. Proiect Implementation&#13;
2.22  Implementing Agencies and Responsibilities. The institutional responsibilities for&#13;
project implementation are shown below:&#13;
Project Component                                Agencies&#13;
Solid Waste Management&#13;
- landfill contracts administration            CMC&#13;
- clinical waste management                    CMC&#13;
- community infrastructure                     UDA/WPC&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
2.23   CMC. CMC is the largest and only jurisdiction in Sri Lanka that presently has an&#13;
organized solid waste management system. The Solid Waste Management Division under the&#13;
Municipal Engineer's Department is responsible for collection and disposal of domestic,&#13;
commercial and industrial solid waste generated within the Municipality. Solid waste&#13;
collection is organized areawise corresponding to the 47 electorates (called wards) which are&#13;
grouped in to six districts. The Division has about 110 technical and supervisory staff, a&#13;
workforce of 2,100, and a fleet of 109 collection vehicles. Besides having most of the locally&#13;
available technical and management capabilities, the CMC is the largest beneficiary of the new&#13;
landfill and hence the primary stakeholder of the landfill component. The Division, with&#13;
assistance of management consultants, will be responsible for the following: (a) procurement&#13;
and supervision of the landfill construction and operation contracts; (b) implementation of&#13;
clinical waste management including training of hospital staff and procurement of equipment&#13;
and collection/transport services; (c) implementation of a phased program of contracting out&#13;
primary solid waste collection; and (d) implementation of adequate cost recovery mechanisms&#13;
to sustain the delivery of solid waste services.&#13;
2.24   For economies of scale, the new landfill is designed to serve the solid waste disposal&#13;
needs of CMC and about 14 LAs located in the CMA. The Welisara landfill site is within the&#13;
jurisdiction of the Wattala Urban Council. During negotiations, assurance was obtained that&#13;
GOSL will take all necessary actions to ensure that CMC has full and complete access at any&#13;
time to the landfill site during the construction and operation of the landfill. To foster broad&#13;
beneficiary participation, UDA, with the assistance of the Western Provincial Council (WPC),&#13;
will serve as the focal point for coordinating among all LAs that intend to use the landfill site.&#13;
2.25   NWSDB. Created under the 1974 National Water Supply and Drainage Board Act,&#13;
NWSDB is the principal institution involved in the development of urban and rural piped water&#13;
supply schemes and urban sewerage schemes. NWSDB's most important activity is the&#13;
abstraction of water from the Kelani Ganga for supplying the CMA. It administers 216&#13;
systems nationwide, has about 6,800 employees and serves about 4.8 million people.&#13;
Operational management has been decentralized to five regional offices, which oversee district&#13;
offices headed by district managers. NWSDB functions under the Ministry of Housing,&#13;
Construction and Public Utilities (MHCPU).&#13;
2.26   Past IDA operations in the water and sanitation sector in Sri Lanka have included&#13;
assistance to improve NWSDB's technical and financial management capabilities and&#13;
operating practices. To date, IDA has made four credits for the sector; of these, three were&#13;
implemented by NWSDB. The first two credits (Crs. 709-CE and 1041 -CE) helped finance&#13;
the expansion of the Colombo water supply system and were closed in December 1983 and&#13;
September 1986, respectively. The third credit (Cr. 1700-CE, US$37.0 million) focuses&#13;
primarily on rehabilitation of water supply systems in and outside Colombo and is to close on&#13;
June 30, 1995. Project implementation performance has been overall satisfactory. The&#13;
existing project implementation unit for Cr. 1700-CE will be maintained to implement the&#13;
wastewater collection systems project component as well as the Beira Lake catchment area&#13;
sewerage works.&#13;
2.27   UDA. UDA was established under the Urban Development Authority Law of 1978,&#13;
with the responsibility to carry out integrated planning and physical development of urban areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
in Sri Lanka. Since its inception, several amendments to the 1978 UDA law have been passed&#13;
which provide UDA with wide powers to acquire, develop and dispose of lands and properties,&#13;
and exercise stringent controls over urban development activities. The areas within UDA's&#13;
purview include 11 municipal councils, 35 urban councils, 46 local authorities, the Trincomalee&#13;
District, and local authorities located within a one kilometer-wide belt along the coast. The&#13;
functions of UDA include: (a) carry out integrated planning and physical development within&#13;
and among the designated development areas; (b) formulate and implement an urban land use&#13;
policy; (c) devel p environmental standards and prepare schemes for environmental&#13;
improvemf nts in the development areas; (d) formulate and execute housing schemes; and (e)&#13;
cause the clearing of slum and shanty areas and undertake the development of such areas.&#13;
2.28   UDA reports to MHCPU and is managed by a 13-member Board, comprising the&#13;
UDA chairman, 4 members nominated by the Minister and 8 members representing other&#13;
Government Ministries. There are eight divisions in UDA responsible, respectively, for&#13;
Planning, Lands and °roperty, Design and Project Management, Development Regulation,&#13;
Building Regulations, Finance, Legal Matter, and Administration. UDA presently has nearly&#13;
1,000 employees. Given that UDA plays an important role in the overall development of the&#13;
CMA, in :luding the Beira Lake area, GOSL designated it as the apex agency responsible for&#13;
the Beira Lake restoration. Since the phase I interventions to be implemented under the project&#13;
are sewerage works, NWSDB will oversee the implementation of the physical works on&#13;
UDA's behalf UDA has established a project unit for managing the various technical&#13;
assistance activities, including the Beira Lake monitoring program.&#13;
2.29   Project Coordination and Monitoring. For project coordination and monitoring, a&#13;
Project Coordinator was appointed in November 1994 in the MHCPU, who will coordinate the&#13;
project activities on a daily basis. The project will also be monitored by a Project Monitoring&#13;
Committee chaired by the Secretary of MHCPU and comprising one representative each from&#13;
the MHCPU, Ministry of Finance, Planning, Ethnic Affairs and National Integration, CMC,&#13;
UDA, WPC, NWSDB, Ministry of Transport, Highways, Environment and Women's Affairs,&#13;
and CEA. The Project Coordinator will function as the Committee's convener. IDA Resident&#13;
Mission in Colombo will be represented as an observer. The Committee would meet as often&#13;
as necessary but not less than once a month to review project status against the implementation&#13;
plan and a set of key progress targets and development impact monitoring indicators (para&#13;
2.31). Minutes of the Project Monitoring Committee meetings would be prepared by the&#13;
Project Coordinator and distributed to all Committee members as well as IDA headquarters in&#13;
Washington.&#13;
2.30   Public Participation. To enhance public participation and support for the project&#13;
implementation, it was agreed to constitute a Public Consultation Panel. The panel would&#13;
comprise five representatives from citizens' groups including NGOs and four representatives&#13;
from Govemment agencies. The terms of reference of the panel is presented in Annex 8. The&#13;
composition of the panel was confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
2.31   Project Implementation Plan. A time-bound implementation plan for each project&#13;
component and key physical progress and development impact monitoring indicators are given&#13;
in Annex 9. These were discussed and agreed with GOSL and the implementing agencies&#13;
during negotiations. To minimize risk of delay in the project's physical start-up, appointment&#13;
of (a) project supervisory consultants for the solid waste management component, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
wastewater collection systems and the Beira Lake catchment area sewerage works, and (b) a&#13;
consultant to assist with the solicitation and evaluation of BOO/BOT proposals for the&#13;
wastewater treatment plants are conditions of credit effectiveness. Project implementation is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 2000.&#13;
I. Project Reporting and Auditing&#13;
2.32   The frequency and format of project reporting requirements were discussed and&#13;
agreed with the implementing agencies during negotiations. During project implementation,&#13;
CMC, NWSDB and UDA will prepare quarterly progress reports covering their respective&#13;
project components; these will be submitted to IDA via the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)&#13;
within one month of the end of the quarter. The main purpose of the reports is to provide&#13;
timely and updated information on implementation of the project components, highlighting&#13;
issues and problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on progress in following up&#13;
earlier recommendations. An outline of the project progress reporting requirements is in&#13;
Annex 10. Within four months of project completion, CMCfNWSDB/UDA will prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA their portion of the Project Implementation Completion Report in accordance&#13;
with IDA guidelines, on the execution and initial operation of the project, its costs and the&#13;
benefits derived from it, the accomplishment of the objectives of the credit, the plan for the&#13;
project's future operation and the lessons learned.&#13;
2.33   CMC, NWSDB and UDA are required to maintain separate accounts for their&#13;
respective project components. Independent auditors, acceptable to IDA will audit annually the&#13;
project accounts as well as the agencies' financial statements, including withdrawals made on&#13;
the basis of SOEs and from the Special Account, in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles acceptable to IDA. CMC/NWSDB/UDA will submit these audit reports to IDA not&#13;
later than seven months after the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
J. Proiect Supervision&#13;
2.34  It is expected that two supervision missions per year would be required over the life of&#13;
the project, with an estimated total staff input of 85 staff weeks. More extensive supervision&#13;
would be required during the first two years of the project during which time the technical&#13;
assistance would be made operational and many procurement contracts would be tendered,&#13;
evaluated and awarded. Supervision would be provided by engineering, environmental and&#13;
financial staff, as well as urban planning and GIS specialists as needed. A tentative supervision&#13;
plan with staffing and timing of the missions is given in Annex 11. The first supervision&#13;
scheduled for October 1995 will organize a project launch workshop. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with GOSL on a comprehensive mid-term project review to be carried&#13;
out not later than September 30, 1997. The mid-term review will focus on (a) progress of the&#13;
landfill construction; (b) the cost recovery mechanisms put into place to meet the operating&#13;
costs of the landfill; (c) progress of CMC and other LAs in involving the private sector in solid&#13;
waste services; (d) GOSL's progress in securing private sponsors for the two wastewater&#13;
treatment plants proposed for Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela; (e) implementation of cost recovery&#13;
measures for the Colombo sewerage system; and (f) progress of capacity building technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

m. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.1    Historically, provision of basic municipal services, including solid waste collection and&#13;
sanitation, has been a public sector undertaking in Sri Lanka. To date, financing of investments&#13;
in the water supply and sanitation sector has been entirely arranged by GOSL, and funds&#13;
secured from multilateral and bilateral sources were passed on to NWSDB and local&#13;
authorities on concessionary terms. For water supply schemes operated and managed by&#13;
NWSDB, NWSDB has adopted the policy of setting water tariffs at levels sufficient to meet&#13;
operations and maintenance costs plus debt service to GOSL in accordance with the onlending&#13;
agreei Ments. However, the lack of funding for operations and maintenance resulting from&#13;
limited or nonexistent cost recovery mechanisms found in most local authorities has hindered&#13;
progress in extending coverage of urgently needed solid waste and sewerage services. To&#13;
improve overall man.gement and delivery of crucial municipal services, adoption of adequate&#13;
cost recovery mechanisms is an important first step. To this end, agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations on the mechanisms of setting up dedicated sources of funding to sustain the&#13;
operatior.s of the project-supported investments as detailed below.&#13;
Solid Waste Services&#13;
3.2    Presently, rates and property taxes remain the single largest source of revenue for&#13;
municipal and local authorities. According to CMC's 1995 budget, revenues from rates and&#13;
property taxes, rents, fees and charges total about SLRs 1.1 billion, as against a budget of&#13;
recurrent expenditures of SLRs 1.2 billion. Current expenditures on solid waste services over&#13;
the period amount to SLRs 160 million or SLRs 760/ton (US$15/ton). Recognizing the room&#13;
for efficiency gains, CMC plans to contract out primary solid waste collection services over the&#13;
period of 1996-97. Technical assistance is provided under the project to prepare model&#13;
bidding and contract documents for concessioning solid waste primary collection services and&#13;
for assisting CMC and participating LAs in awarding concessions and monitoring compliance&#13;
with contract conditions. Based on the assumptions of (a) CMC's achieving a 20% savings in&#13;
collection costs, (b) a tipping fee of SLRs 1 50/ton (US$3.0/ton) at the new landfill, and (c)&#13;
CMC's bearing the full construction cost of the landfill, it is estimated that CMC would need&#13;
to raise additional revenues in the order of SLRs 90 million per year to meet the operating cost&#13;
of the landfill and debt service to GOSL.2 The above amount is equal to about 10% of the&#13;
1995 levies of rates and property taxes and entails an increase of SLRs 900 (US$18) per&#13;
property per year. No major difficulties are envisaged for CMC to raise the estimated amount&#13;
through direct service charges or other means within a 3-year period of 1996-98. For the other&#13;
LAs who use the Welisara landfill, they would be required to share, as a minimum, the&#13;
incremental operating costs incurred by the landfill operator.&#13;
3.3    To ensure funds generated through collection of property taxes or levy of separate solid&#13;
waste charges are readily available to meet the operating cost of the sanitary landfill, it was&#13;
agreed during negotiations that (a) CMC and participating LAs will open and maintain an&#13;
2 Based on the projected waste disposal of 250,000 tonnes per year and a tipping fee of SLRs 150/ton, the operating cost to be&#13;
bome by CMC would be SLRs 37.5 million; the annualized capital cost for a USS14 million investment would amount to&#13;
SLRs 82 million per year assuming a 20-year repayTnent period and a 10% interest rate; a 20% cost reduction in&#13;
collection services would yield SLRs 30 million per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
escrow account with a financial intermediary for the purpose of making payments to the landfill&#13;
operator; (b) commencing at least three months prior to the date when the site is ready to&#13;
receive wastes, make monthly deposits into the escrow account based on the projected&#13;
tonnages of wastes and the cost-sharing formula agreed by CMC and other participating LAs;&#13;
and (c) maintain the balance in the escrow account at a level sufficient to cover three months of&#13;
the operating expenses of the landfill.&#13;
SewemageSe&#13;
3.4  Colombo Sewerage System. Adequate cost recovery is also critically needed with&#13;
respect to sewerage services. CMC through its Drainage Division is responsible for the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the stormwater and sanitary sewerage systems in Colombo. Due&#13;
to the age of the gravity sewers and lack of proper maintenance resulting from chronic shortage&#13;
of funds and lack of equipment and technical know-how to effect repairs, the existing sewerage&#13;
system is in need of extensive repair and rehabilitation to restore its capacity. As visual&#13;
inspections alone are inadequate to determine the extent of remedial work needed, a program to&#13;
clean and inspect the major sewers needs to be carried out as a first step. Given CMC's&#13;
limitations in terms of availability of skilled manpower and equipment resources, it has been&#13;
agreed that commencing in January 1996, NWSDB will take over the operation and&#13;
maintenance responsibility of the Colombo sewerage system.&#13;
3.5  To date, there has been a reluctance to implement a separate tariff for sewerage services.&#13;
The rates collected by CMC include an unspecified portion for sewerage services.&#13;
Nevertheless, annual appropriations from CMC's pool of general revenues have been&#13;
inadequate, and this is the root cause of the poor physical state of the sewerage system. For&#13;
NWSDB to properly operate and maintain the Colombo sewerage system in the future, a&#13;
dedicated source of funding for sewerage operations based on cost recovery targets will be&#13;
established. It was agreed during negotiations that (a) CMC and NWSDB will, starting&#13;
January 1, 1996, establish and maintain a dedicated account to fund operation and maintenance&#13;
of the Colombo sewerage system; (b) CMC will contribute, from its revenue generation, an&#13;
amount not below SLRs 70 million for 1996 and each year thereafter; and (c) NWSDB will&#13;
contribute, with funds generated through water billing surcharge, an amount not below SLRs&#13;
20 million for 1996 and each year thereafter. The above funding is about twice the level of&#13;
current annual budgetary allocations and would cover the full operation and maintenance cost&#13;
of the Colombo sewerage system in the interim period.&#13;
3.6   Industrial Wastewater Treatment. According to the feasibility study reports of the&#13;
Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela wastewater collection and treatment schemes, a sewerage tariff in&#13;
the order of SLRs 40/m3 is required to achieve full cost recovery. This is in addition to the&#13;
connection cost to be bome by individual users. The estimated charges for wastewater&#13;
treatment would be around one to four percent of the annual revenues of individual industries&#13;
and are considered affordable. In the case of Ratmalana scheme, since the proposed system is&#13;
intended to serve residential areas as well, some form of cross-subsidy from industrial users&#13;
would be needed to encourage speedy connections by domestic consumers. To sustain the&#13;
operation of the investments, it was agreed during negotiations that NWSDB will generate&#13;
revenues from its sewerage operations in Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, sufficient to cover the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
full operating and maintenance cost of the sewer networks and the amounts billed by the&#13;
wastewater treatment plant operators.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
4.1    The project addresses underlying causes of environmental degradation in the Colombo&#13;
metropolitan area and will benefit over 3 million people. The replacement of open dumps with&#13;
a controlled sanitary landLill will eliminate contamination of surface and ground water&#13;
resources from open dump seepage or leachates, improve urban environmental conditions and&#13;
landscape aesthetics. Improved management of hospital wastes through specialized collection&#13;
and safe disposal will lower public health impacts of uncontrolled disposal of infectious and&#13;
pathological wastes. The two industrial areas at Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela account for about&#13;
60% of polluting industries in the CMA; the sewerage investments would thus lead to a&#13;
significant reduction in the overall pollution contribution of the industrial sector and a general&#13;
improvement in the population health in the areas concerned. The interventions in the Beira&#13;
Lake catchment will help reduce associated environmental and health hazards and open the&#13;
way for environmentally sustainable development of the lake's surrounding area in the longer&#13;
term. Besides the above direct benefits, the project would serve to catalyze private&#13;
participabon in the delivery of critical urban infrastructure services traditionally undertaken by&#13;
the public sector. This is expected to contribute to increased service coverage, improved&#13;
service quality and efficiency. The project would also have a significant demonstration effect&#13;
to sensitize other urban authorities to adopt better managed and environmentally sound wastes&#13;
management systems.&#13;
4.2  Since the project has significant environmental and social benefits which are not&#13;
easily quantifiable, a rate of return calculated based on the magnitude of cost recovery&#13;
would not measure the economic merit of the project; thus, no attempt has been made in&#13;
this regard. Instead, using a cost effectiveness approach, the project's physical&#13;
investments have been subjected to systematic comparisons of alternatives in terms of&#13;
capital and recurrent costs, suitability under local conditions, institutional requirements&#13;
and environmental impacts. The selected alternatives would effectively integrate both&#13;
environmental and economic objectives, and contribute to enhancing public health and&#13;
productivity. The cost recovery measures adopted under the project and private sector&#13;
participation in the provision and operation of wastes management services would lead to&#13;
a minimal fiscal impact on GOSL's budgetary resources and ensure project sustainability.&#13;
The project design incorporates monitoring indicators of both physical progress and&#13;
developmental impact.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
4.3   Potential project risks are: (a) shortfalls in cost recovery to sustain the operations of the&#13;
project supported investments; (b) weak enforcement of industrial wastewater discharge&#13;
standards by CEA, which would reduce pressure on industries to connect to the joint&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
wastewater collection and treatment systems; and (c) lack of adequate response from the&#13;
private sector for the two wastewater treatment plants. These risks have been recognized and&#13;
suitable safeguards have been incorporated in the project implementation as detailed below.&#13;
4.4    Cost Recovery. To sustain the operations of project facilities agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations on the mechanisms for setting up dedicated sources of funds for the above&#13;
operations and on cost recovery targets satisfactory to IDA (paras. 3.3, 3.5 and 3.6).&#13;
4.5   Enforcement. To step up enforcement, GOSL has committed to implementing a time-&#13;
bound compliance program for the two industrial areas. Under this program, CEA, NWSDB&#13;
and each of the targeted industries will enter into an agreement confirming compliance with&#13;
established effluent discharge standards through using the proposed joint treatment facilities or&#13;
its own captive treatment plant. All agreements would be concluded by June 1997.&#13;
4.6   Financing of Wastewater Treatment Plants. To minimize the risk that private sector&#13;
interest may not materialize in a time frame commensurate with the implementation of the&#13;
project, GOSL through NWSDB will implement a program of specific actions aimed at&#13;
concluding contractual agreements with private sponsors by March 1997 (as detailed in Annex&#13;
9, Section II.C). Intemational consultants will be mobilized in October 1995 to assist in the&#13;
preparation of solicitation packages and evaluation of proposals. No withdrawals would be&#13;
allowed with respect to the wastewater collection works until financing arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to IDA for the construction of the treatment plants have been concluded. It was&#13;
also agreed during negotiations that, in the event that private sector BOO/BOT arrangements&#13;
fail to develop, GOSL will arrange funds from altemative sources for the construction of the&#13;
wastewater treatment plants.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The combined results of demographic, economic and industrial growth have evolved to a state&#13;
where generation of municipal and industrial waste is outstripping the capacity of the Govemment of&#13;
Sri Lanka (GOSL) to provide infrastructure to accommodate ever increasing volumes. The proposed&#13;
project component would concentrate on CMA's most pressing needs by providing for a new sanitary&#13;
landfill to replace existing open dumps, assisting in the preparation of a detailed long term waste&#13;
management strategy and disposal plan for the whole of the metropolitan area, separating hospital&#13;
waste from municipal waste and devising a program to handle it safely, helping reduce the quantity of&#13;
waste that requires disposal through the promotion of composting, and finally, by furnishing technical&#13;
assistance to develop in-country waste management capabilities with particular focus on helping&#13;
arrange private sector participation in solid waste management.&#13;
Background.&#13;
2.     The CMA comprises the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and 30 urban local authorities&#13;
(ULAs) in the Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha Districts of the Western Province. Up to four million&#13;
residents plus commuters generate CMA's solid waste. The waste consists mainly of three types:&#13;
(a) municipal waste from domestic and commercial sources; (b) industrial waste generated within&#13;
specific industrial parks and by other industries scattered throughout CMA; and (c) hospital waste. As&#13;
Sri Lanka's industrial and commercial capital, Colombo is expected to grow by one-third over the next&#13;
decade, thus virtually guaranteeing that waste generation will also continue to grow.&#13;
3.    Municipal Waste. Studies completed by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO)&#13;
show that municipal solid waste in CMA is presently collected at the rate of approximately&#13;
1,100 tons/day (tpd). The breakdowns are: 680 tpd from CMC, 90 tpd from Dehiwala - Mt. Lavinia,&#13;
120 tpd from Moratuwa, and 112 tpd from Kotte, and the rest from the remaining 27 ULAs. The ratio&#13;
of waste collected to waste generated ranges from approximately 93% in CMC to as little as 5% in&#13;
some of the smaller ULAs. The current volume of waste to be disposed of annually is 450,000 m3,&#13;
projected to increase at 4% per annum for the foreseeable future.&#13;
4.    Hospital Waste. Current disposal of medical wastes is not environmentally acceptable.&#13;
Dangerous infectious clinical wastes are mixed with municipal waste. This indiscriminate mixing poses&#13;
a serious health hazard at each stage of collection and storage within the hospital, and of transport and&#13;
disposal in landfills and open dumps. Even though Colombo's 20-odd hospitals generate only about&#13;
4 tons per day of waste, an acceptable management and disposal system is urgently required. Whereas&#13;
the bulk of the waste strearm, about 85% by volume, consists of non-clinical waste, especially&#13;
packaging and food, the remaining clinical portion is far more important despite its smaller share in&#13;
volume. Clinical wastes, currently estimated at about 3 tons per day, consists of human tissue, sharps&#13;
(i.e., needles, glass), disposable medical equipmernt (e.g., gloves, aprons, urine containers),&#13;
pharmaceutical wastes, laboratory wastes, special treatment wastes (e.g., from treating cancer), and&#13;
low level radioactive wastes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
5.    Segregation of sharps has recently been introduced, but even so, they are merely kept in&#13;
overflowing cardboard boxes while awaiting pickup within the hospital. Intemational standards&#13;
comnonly require that sharps be incinerated, and their ash disposed in a sanitary landfill. Since such&#13;
facilities are unavailable in Colombo, sharps are often burned on hospital grounds merely using&#13;
kerosene. Other clinical wastes are deposited together with nonclinical wastes in regular trash&#13;
containers without special lids to keep them securely fastened. From that point, the containers are&#13;
transported in open trolleys through corridors to an open container where they are kept awaiting pick-&#13;
up by CMC. In some instances, scavengers ferret through the mixed waste.&#13;
6.    Radioactive waste, however, is handled more efficiently. The liquid portion is deposited in a&#13;
properly constructed well which is monitored regularly and has not shown signs of contarmination.&#13;
Similarly, the solid portion is kept in a proper storage area for a period of about two years, by which&#13;
time the waste is rendered harmless.&#13;
7.    Collection. Within CMC, waste is taken from households by handcarts and deposited at some&#13;
1,004 container collection points. The containers generally provide adequate and tidy storage of the&#13;
waste prior to collection for disposal. Their contents can be efficiently loaded by automatic means into&#13;
collection vehicles. Within the other ULAs, waste collection points generally are little more than open&#13;
patches of ground where waste is dumped, requiring hand-loading onto secondary transport, which&#13;
transfers it to the disposal site. This entails a variety of vehicles ranging from refiise compaction&#13;
vehicles to simple trucks. The service is carried out to an unequal standard; high grade commercial and&#13;
residential areas generally receive good service, which rapidly deteriorates in poorer areas. Several&#13;
waste management studies have been carried out on CMA. Problems include shortages across a broad&#13;
range of items: financial resources, vehicles, containers, maintenance facilities, and disposal facilities,&#13;
together with the skills to manage these facilities.&#13;
8.    Disposal. Currently, most of CMA's waste is disposed of at Wellampitiya, a 12 ha. marshy site&#13;
within the city. It is expected that the site will reach its maximum capacity to accept waste after 1995.&#13;
About two-thirds of the waste collected in CMC is deposited at Wellampitiya. Some ULAs also use&#13;
this site for disposal, but most ULAs tend to use local uncontrolled dumps. Even though Wellampitiya&#13;
is spoken of as a sanitary landfill, it was designed mainly to get garbage out of the way. When it was&#13;
developed as a waste disposal site, little preparatory work was undertaken to contain surface water,&#13;
control leachate, or prevent gas. All these factors have contributed to contamination of the local&#13;
aquifer. No cover material is available at the site and the waste sometimes remains uncovered. Flocks&#13;
of crows seem permanent and it is certain that other pests are present.  The site also exudes&#13;
considerable odor, which has resulted in many complaints from nearby residents. A considerable&#13;
number of scavengers are present on the site.&#13;
The Municipal Solid Waste Management Component&#13;
9.    The Municipal Solid Waste Management Component consists of five subcomponents:&#13;
(i) a landfill at Welisara; (ii) hospital waste management; (iii) compost promotion; (iv) assistance to&#13;
prepare a long-term disposal strategy; and (v) institutional development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
10.   Welisara Landfill. The subcomponent consists of: (i) construction of a new landfill at Welisara&#13;
to meet disposal requirements of CMC and 14 of the 30 ULAs located north and east of CMC for the&#13;
7-vear period 1998-2004; preparation of final designs/plans for site development, monitoring and&#13;
closure; procurement of equipment; and (ii) management and operation of the facilities, including&#13;
specific responsibilities relating to hospital waste disposal.&#13;
11.   The Welisara site for the landfill was selected from about 300 potential sites. These were&#13;
subject to various evaluations and finally six were shortlisted and considered in detail. The site has&#13;
been chosen because it does not contain flora and fauna of ecological significance, and is not of major&#13;
economic importance to CMA or local inhabitants. The landfill site covers approximately 32 ha,&#13;
although some 50 ha will need to be set aside to allow the appropriate buffer zones, and is essentially&#13;
flat with its elevation at sea level. The site geology consists primarily of several meters of peat with&#13;
layers of organic sands and clays overlying latefite bedrock. The peat is to be excavated to create void&#13;
space for the waste and will be used as daily cover for the waste as it is deposited. The site has been&#13;
designed to accommodate around 2.5 x 106 tons of waste. Total capacity of the site is calculated at&#13;
around 3.5 x 106m3, which allows for an additional 20% volume to accommodate engineering works&#13;
and environmental protection measures such as tipping area, leachate treatment lagoons, compost&#13;
plant, flood protection earthworks and peat storage. Apart from the area to be filled, the site would&#13;
incorporate a waste reception area. Waste reception facilities would consist of: an approach road&#13;
about Sm wide; 2 weigh bridges with by-pass lanes, plus a booking office; 2 electronically operated&#13;
barriers; 2 vehicle wash bays, plus lagoons for waste water and oily deposits; and a notice board with&#13;
pertinent information on regulations, rates and schedules (in 3 Sinhala, Tamil and English). Support&#13;
facilities include: security gate and fencing; site management office; apron for maintenance; stores;&#13;
parking area; testing laboratory; first-aid/health room; vehicle maintenance workshop (20m x 20m);&#13;
fenced-in plant compound/workshop (40m x 40m); fuel storage and refueling area. The site has been&#13;
designed with adequate space to avoid blockage of main roads, reduce queuing and other waits. (A list&#13;
of equipment is provided in the attachment to this annex.)&#13;
12.   Construction of the landfill, procurement of mobile equipment for the operational phase, and&#13;
management of the landfill operations will be procured on a turnkey contract basis from prequalified&#13;
contractors. Formal plans for Site Operations, Environmental Control and Monitoring, Restoration&#13;
and Management will be developed by the turnkey contractor as part of the detailed design process.&#13;
The conceptual design outlines the following requirements:&#13;
(a)    Site Operation. The site will be operated on a cellular approach, with each cell&#13;
sealed at its base and sides and eventually its surface when filled to capacity. thus, at&#13;
any given time, areas would be under excavation, undergoing floor preparation, being&#13;
filled and covered, and finally being restored. All wastes will be measured, identified&#13;
and documented, to be confirmed by regular inspection to ensure that the waste is&#13;
suitable for disposal at the site. Hospital waste would be deposited in a pre-arranged&#13;
area and covered immediately with soil by a bulldozer; access to the designated area&#13;
will be strictly limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
(b)   Environment Control and Monitoring. The site will be monitored regularly to&#13;
ensure that all potentially adverse environmental impacts are identified and dealt with&#13;
expeditiously. These controls consist of measures to deal with litter, pests, birds,&#13;
odors, dust and mud, plus noise of operations and the risk of fire. Buffer zones will&#13;
be established to protect surrounding areas and to improve aesthetics.  No&#13;
putrescible waste will be deposited closer than 60 m from residential property, 50m&#13;
from privately held land or 30m to the railway line and the Kalu Ela river. Bunds 2-&#13;
3m high and shrubbery belts a minimum of lOm wide will be constructed for surface&#13;
planting.&#13;
(c)    Restoration.  Progressive surface restoration will take place for aesthetic and&#13;
ecological reasons, the latter primarily to limit water ingress and to control gas&#13;
emissions. It is expected that waste from the site will take up to 50 years to stabilize,&#13;
with half of the physical settlement, or up to 25% of the total waste deposited,&#13;
occurring within 3 years of capping.&#13;
(d)   Management.  Landfill operations are to be managed by the landfill turnkey&#13;
contractor. The site will be under the supervision of a designated site manager,&#13;
responsible for allocation of resources and tasks, training, supervision, enforcement&#13;
of regulated operating procedures, compliance with health and safety regulations and&#13;
with the Environmental Control and Monitoring Plan. The site will generally be&#13;
operational between the hours of 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., during which time waste will&#13;
be accepted and covered and engineering works will be undertaken. The site will&#13;
have a system to ensure effective communications within the 30 ha area for the&#13;
operatives, haulers, and visitors. Unobstructed access to the site and site activities&#13;
will be maintained in the interest of emergency and first aid situations. A staff of 57&#13;
persons is envisaged, working in 12-hour shifts.  A liaison committee will be&#13;
established consisting of representatives from landfill management, the local council,&#13;
residents, and emergency services.&#13;
13.   Hospital Waste Management. The subcomponent consists of: (i) technical assistance to&#13;
implement safe housekeeping procedures for collection and storage of clinical waste in-house; and&#13;
(ii) provision of equipment for safe collection and transport of these wastes to the disposal site.&#13;
Hospital waste would be collected according to a fixed schedule and transported to the Welisara site&#13;
where it would be deposited in a prearranged area and covered immediately with soil by a bulldozer;&#13;
access to the designated area will be strictly limited.&#13;
14.   Compost Promotion. Several studies have been conducted which confirm the economic&#13;
potential for composting. A 1993 USAID-funded study of waste composition showed approximately&#13;
90% by weight of domestic and commercial solid waste (except from hotels) is organic waste and non-&#13;
recyclable paper. A 20 tpd pilot scale demonstration facility went into operation in early 1994. The&#13;
potential demand was projected to be between 72,000 - 180,000 tons per year for use in commercial&#13;
planting as a soil conditioner. Further benefits include reduced landfill space as only rejects from the&#13;
compost process (estimated at 10 percent of the volume composted) will require land filling. Based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page S of 6&#13;
the above, the project would finance a 100 tpd compost plant at Welisara landfill site. It is intended&#13;
that the landfill contractor will also be responsible for the final design, construction and operation of the&#13;
compost facility, and financial incentives will form part of the contract to encourage the contractor to&#13;
make a success of the composting operation and undertake the necessary market development. In&#13;
order to monitor the progress of the scheme, the contractor will be required to submit progress reports&#13;
on the status of the compost operation, the quality and quantities of compost produced, the market&#13;
situation and a financial analysis of the operation. At the end of 3 years a detailed assessment report&#13;
will be submitted by the contractor which will enable the potential for replication on a similar or larger&#13;
scale to be determined.&#13;
15.   Assistance to Prepare a Long Term Disposal Strategy.  Considerable difficulty has been&#13;
experienced in identifying and reaching agreement on the location of a landfill site to satisfy the disposal&#13;
needs of the whole of CMA. The proposed landfill at Welisara will only serve part of the CMA area&#13;
and its active life is expected to be only around seven years. To develop a longer term solution to meet&#13;
the solid waste disposal needs of the whole of the CMA, the project includes technical assistance&#13;
through consultancy services to: (a) identify and assess potential landfill sites to serve CMA, develop a&#13;
strategy for operation involving the transfer of wastes if appropriate, and provide a short list of sites for&#13;
consideration by GOSL; and (b) develop detailed conceptual designs and cost estimates for the chosen&#13;
site(s) and prepare tender documents for turnkey contracts or BOO/BOT arrangements.&#13;

RATMALANA AND EKALA/JA-ELA WASTEWATER COLLECTION&#13;
AND TREATMENT SCHEMES&#13;
I.    For nearly two decades industries have been encouraged to grow, without concomitant&#13;
attention being paid to the consequences of industrial pollution. The resultant wastewater pollution has&#13;
been especially severe to two areas of Colombo. The proposed schemes call for the construction of a&#13;
central waste treatment plant in each of two industrial zones; one in the Ratmalana and Moratuwa area&#13;
to the south, and the other in the Ekala and Ja-Ela area to the north. Feasibility studies have been&#13;
conducted for each of the two study zones and are available in the Project File. ,&#13;
Ratmalana/Moratuwa&#13;
2.     Study Area. Ratmalana/Moratuwa is a large area of rnixed land use within the Colombo&#13;
Metropolitan Area (CMA). The overall boundaries of the study area are within the southern end of the&#13;
Dehiwela - Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council and the northern end of the Moratuwa Urban Council. The&#13;
area, about 15 km south of Cclombo, underwent major industrial development during the 1950s and&#13;
1970s. Presently, approximately 350,000 residents live in the 40 km2 which make up the area. The&#13;
area is characterized by mixed land uses, with about 225 industrial facilities intermixed with residential&#13;
and commercial establishments. Two water bodies, Lunawa Lagoon and Bolgoda Lake, are in the&#13;
area. Residential developments generally occur as single family lots, although pockets of higher density&#13;
multi-family developments are also present. Low-income and squatter settlements occur throughout&#13;
the area, in particular along canal banks and lake/lagoon shorelines, much of which is polluted.&#13;
3.    Industrial pollution has long been recognized as a problem in the area. Liquid wastes from&#13;
industries are discharged untreated into nearby drainage courses. Domestic wastewater from flush&#13;
toilets is directed to septic tanks and soakage pits, whereas grey water from showers, sinks, and&#13;
washers is generally discharged directly to roadside ditches. Pressure from expanding populations has&#13;
forced residents to construct wells adjacent to existing septic tanks, often in violation of minimum safe&#13;
distances required by planning agencies. The high water table in much of the area further aggravates&#13;
this problem  and fecal contamination of wells is becoming more evident.  Residents of these&#13;
communities are in intimate contact with the water, thus confronting problems with conmmunicable&#13;
disease and public health.&#13;
4.    Because of the continual discharge of wastewater into its tributaries, Lunawa Lagoon, which&#13;
supported a significant fisheries industry a decade ago, is totally devoid of aquatic life today. Although&#13;
Bolgoda Lake has not degraded to the same extent, there is increasing concem that the long term&#13;
effects of continued industrial wastewater discharge into it will seriously compromise its economic and&#13;
ecological value.&#13;

5.    Inventory of Industries. There are over 225 industries located in the Ratmalana-Moratuwa&#13;
area, employing a workforce of more than 57,000. The majority of the industries are small to medium&#13;
scale with respect to the number of employees. Four major industrial locations are present in the study&#13;
area: the Lady Catherine Estate, the Attidiya Zone, the Airport Zone, and the Railway Workshop area.&#13;
6.    Whereas garment manufacturing and textile processing dominate, the industries are categorized&#13;
below into nine groups based on waste generation:&#13;
(a)    Garment making. This is a dry manufacturing process, with no process water usage;&#13;
over 80 such factories exist, producing clothes mainly for export; most employ less&#13;
than 500 workers, with a few employing up to 1,700 workers; wastewater is from&#13;
domestic sources. (Factories that have industrial washing facilities are classified under&#13;
TextilelProcessing).&#13;
(b)    Textile manufacturing and processing. About 50% of the total wastewater generated&#13;
in the study area is from seven large scale and 13 smaller scale factories which include:&#13;
dyeing of cloth and yam; finishing operations for fabric/clothing; industrial washing&#13;
plants; manufacture of footwear.&#13;
(c)    Metal fabrication  and equipment manufacture.   This includes 23  industries&#13;
manufacturing metal fixtures, appliances, fabricated metal products and structural&#13;
metal; effluent comes from wash water and pickling liquors.&#13;
(d)    Chemicals, pharmaceuticals and allied products. Twenty industries are involved in the&#13;
formulation of agrochemicals, cosmetics, paints and thinners, of which four&#13;
manufacture drugs. Most effluent comes from washing operations rather than process&#13;
water since many of the industries are involved with mixing, formulation and&#13;
repackaging products, as opposed to their manufacture.&#13;
(e)    Food and beverage processing.  This sector consists of four large biscuit and&#13;
confectionery manufacturers, plus 13 others that include factories which process ice&#13;
cream, package milk powder, and bottle beverages.&#13;
(f)    Equipment maintenance, repair workshops and technical training centers.  Sixteen&#13;
facilities consist of maintenance workshops for industrial machinery, heavy equipment&#13;
and vehicles (e.g., railways, roads/construction, irrigation, airport); they produce&#13;
effluent consisting of spill-offs, and wash water from servicing and repairs.&#13;
(g)    Printing. There are nine printing presses and one manufacturer of industrial inks which&#13;
mainly generate wash water from cleaning printing roUlers.&#13;
(h)    Plastics manufacture. Ten industries produce plastics, e.g., molded plastic and PVC&#13;
pipes; effluent volume is low since much of the water is for cooling and is recycled.&#13;
(i)    Other industries. This includes manufacture of optical goods, watches, clocks, glass&#13;
products, asbestos products and hume pipes, plus saw mills and manufacture of wood&#13;
products. The main effluent is curing water from asbestos and pipe manufacture.&#13;

8.     Water Consumption and Effluent Generation. Process wastewater is generated by 100 odd&#13;
industries in the area. About 25% of the industrial establishments account for over 90% of the process&#13;
wastewater generation. The textile manufacturing and processing sector, with less than 10% of the&#13;
factories, is important given that it generates 50% of the wastewater which is heavily polluted and,&#13;
when dyeing fabrics is concerned, may also contain high concentrations of heavy metals. Metal&#13;
fabrication, with about 10% of the industries, is more important because its effluent is highly acidic, and&#13;
could contain high concentrations of metals. The food and beverage is high in BOD and COD, but&#13;
lower than would be expected with oils and grease, probably because there are grease traps in the&#13;
plants themselves. Chemicals and pharmaceuticals generated relatively low BOD and COD, probably&#13;
because there are inhibitory effects or low-biodegradability in certain effluents, Equipment maintenance&#13;
and repair workshops were high in oil and grease content, as anticipated, but weak in other effluent&#13;
categories. Printing was characteristically high in BOD and COD and may also contain high&#13;
concentrations of metals in dyes. The present wastewater generation in the area is estimated to be&#13;
13,400 m3/d, comprising industrial process wastewater (3,270m3/d), industrial domestic wastewater&#13;
(2,870m3/d), residential domestic wastewater (7,150 m3/d), and commercial domestic wastewater&#13;
(I 10m3/d).&#13;
9.     Hazardous Wastes. Hazardous wastes are generated at many of the factories, generally in the&#13;
form of liquid or sludge, with corrosive liquids found in the greatest volume. Textile and metal&#13;
processing effluents are the main sources. Flammable liquids, poisonous wastes and wastes with high&#13;
heavy metal content were also present, but to a lesser extent than corrosives. Many of these wastes are&#13;
discharged directly into the surface drainage system and are at least diluted. Air-borne asbestos fibers&#13;
from pipe insulation and asbestos-cement pipes are also common.&#13;

10.   Proposed System. The wastewater management system proposed for Ratmalana includes (a)&#13;
pre-treatment facilities constructed by industries, (b) a collection network to collect industrial and&#13;
domestic wastewaters from all industrial establishments as well as domestic wastewater in adjacent&#13;
residential areas, (c) a preliminary treatment plant for the removal of large, objectional solids and grit;&#13;
and (d) an ocean outfall to discharge the effluent from the treatment plant to the Indian Ocean. The&#13;
system is dimensioned on the basis of the following parameters:&#13;
average daily flow         21,740 m3/d&#13;
maximum daily flow         28,910 m3/d&#13;
peak wet weather flow      45,840 m3/d&#13;
11.   The collection network would consist of over 40 km of gravity sewer, linked together by six&#13;
pumping stations with corresponding force mains. The proposed preliminary treatment wouldinclude&#13;
influent pumping, screening, grit removal and effluent pumping. The proposed ocean outfall consists&#13;
of a land section (1,100 m) and a marine section (2,000 m). The end of the outfall would be equipped&#13;
with a diffuser section, at an average depth of about 14 m below mean sea level.&#13;
Ekala/Ja-Ela&#13;
12.   Study Area. The study area covers Ja-Ela AGA Division (which includes the subdivision of&#13;
Ekala) and is located about 15 km north of Colombo with an estimated population of 156,400. The Ja-&#13;
Ela Pradeshiya Sabha, Board of Investment (BOI) and Industrial Development Board (IDB) share&#13;
administrative jurisdiction over industrialization in the area. The main industrial concentration lies in&#13;
the Ekala area and includes the Ekala Industrial Estate (EIE), while other industrial areas, including&#13;
some major facilities in the southem part of Ja-Ela AGA Division, are inter-spaced with residential and&#13;
agricultural areas. Given its strategic location and availability of land, the area is being actively&#13;
promoted for industrial expansion.&#13;
13.   Piped water supply is available within the EE, although some factories depend on private&#13;
wells. Sanitary sewerage is serving only EIE at present. Outside the EIE, there is no piped water&#13;
supply or sewerage system; domestic sewage is discharged via septic tanks and soakage pits, while&#13;
industrial wastewaters are discharged into open roadside drains.&#13;
14.   Inventory of Industries. The study area contains 143 industries (including eight which are&#13;
planned), employing a work force of over 21,700 persons. The industries have been classified into 10&#13;
broad categories based on their waste generation:&#13;
*food                      *textile &amp; leather   *chemical&#13;
*mineral products          *metal               * machinery &amp; equipment&#13;
*timber                    *paper               *research&#13;
*agriculture &amp; aquaculture&#13;
The dominant industries are textiles and garments, chemicals (battery, paints, silicone and resins),&#13;
asbestos, rubber, food, and dyes. Textile and chemical industries produce a wide range of products as&#13;
well as types of waste generation. Agriculture and aquaculture include breeding of aquarium fish and&#13;
mushroom cultivation. Most of the industris are small to medium in terms of manpower and water&#13;
consumption. Eighty-nine industries (66%) employ less than 100 persons, while 38 industries employ&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 --&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
a workforce of 101-500. Only two industries employ more than 1,000 people. Out of the total 135&#13;
established industries, 96 are located in the Ekala area, including 39 in the ELE.&#13;
15.   Water Consumption and Effluent Generation. The total present water consumption of the&#13;
industries in the study area is estimated to be 3,705m3/d. Eighty industries use water in their&#13;
production, out of which 66 generate industrial effluent totalling about 1,412 m3/d. Thirteen industries&#13;
have effluent treatment plants of some kind at present; the volume treated averages about 280 m3/d, or&#13;
20% of the total effluent generation. However, it is doubtful whether any of these plants would meet&#13;
the National Environrne-it Act standards without upgrading.&#13;
16.   Hazardous Waste Generation and Disposal. Although numerous incidents of improper&#13;
disposal of toxic waste were noted within the study area, the hazardous waste inventory estimates the&#13;
total amount of harmful and toxic wastes generated to be relatively low at 3,200 tons/year, of which&#13;
1,700 tons/year would be biological sludge from the proposed treatment plant. One fourth of the 143&#13;
firms within the study area are involved in hazardous waste production of any significance.&#13;
17.   Proposed Sytem. The propsed system is for collection and treatment of pre-treated industrial&#13;
effluent as well as domestic wastewater generated by 68 industries located in the Ekala area, including&#13;
39 in the ELE. The existing sewerage network in the ELE covers all 39 industrial establishments and&#13;
has adequate capacity to carry industrial effluent flows; thus, it would form a part of the planned joint&#13;
collection system. The collection network is dimensioned for a total flow of 5,500 m3/d, which&#13;
corresponds with the proposed capacity of the treatment plant plus 50% reserve for capacity&#13;
expansion.&#13;
18.   The joint treatment plant is proposed to be dimensioned in the initial phase for the following&#13;
key parameters estimated to be reached in the year 2003:&#13;
flow                             3,500 m3/d (360 m3/h)&#13;
biological oxygen demand (BOD5)  1,620kg/d&#13;
chemical oxygen demand (COD)    3,300 kg/d&#13;
total suspended soldis (TSS)     610kg/d&#13;
Project Support&#13;
19.   The proposed project would finance construction of wastewater collection systems described&#13;
above. GOSL is to seek private financing of wastewater treatment plants. Technical assistance is&#13;
provided under the project to assist in the solicitation and evaluation of BOO/BOT proposals.&#13;

BEIRA LAKE RESTORATION&#13;
1.    Background. Beira Lake, a distinct landmark in the center of Colombo and once an economic&#13;
and aesthetic asset, is now a polluted waterbody. The lake has a surface area of 65 ha. and a mean&#13;
depth of 2 meters, and is situated in a catchment of approximately 448 ha. The lake comprises of four&#13;
main basins: the East Lake, the Galle Face Lake, the West Lake and the Southwest Lake. The East&#13;
Lake is the largest and deepest (43 ha., maximum depth of 5.6m). Its U-shaped configuration gives the&#13;
lake an exceptionally long shoreline relative to its size, increasing its susceptibility to runoff from its&#13;
overall catchment area and from inappropriate use of the shoreline. Shoreline uses include industry,&#13;
warehousing, shipping, marine repair facilities, government offices, hotels, public open space,&#13;
recreational areas, and religious centers. The lake also contains an island temple. Lake water uses&#13;
include transport, fishing, and recreation, as well as bathing and washing for shanty dwellers.&#13;
Residential, industrial and institutional land uses typify the lake's catchment area, which has been almost&#13;
entirely urbanized.&#13;
2.    Beira Lake's water quality is poor and emits unpleasant odors. The accumulation of pollution&#13;
over the years has made the lake highly eutrophic. A comprehensive water quality study done in 1985&#13;
showed high concentrations of organic materials and other nutrients; high turbidity and algal growth;&#13;
wide fluctuations of dissolved oxygen; and high counts of faecal coliform bacteria from domestic&#13;
sewage. These results were confirmed in a 1993 study.&#13;
3.    Pollution sources are varied, consisting principally of stormwater runoff containing illegal&#13;
discharges of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, and sewage and solid waste from shanty&#13;
settlements. Large portions of the shoreline have been abused for indiscriminate waste disposal.&#13;
Nearly 500 low-income housing units with a population of about 2,400 are located along the shore.&#13;
Some of these families have extended their properties by landfilling, without adequate precautions to&#13;
prevent soil erosion and other runoff. Over one thousand stormwater outfalls open into the lake,&#13;
contributing all forms of urban waste. Particularly noteworthy are wastewaters from laundries,&#13;
garages, hotels, arrny facilities and hospitals. Wastewater from the Colombo General Hospital has&#13;
been estimated to be 100 times more significant than any of the outfalls since hospital waste tends to be&#13;
very high in pathogens, BOD and nutrient values. Raw sewage from overflows in the sewerage&#13;
network and from unauthorized connections of sewers and septic tanks to stormwater drains, further&#13;
contaminates the lake. Most industries in the catchment area are connected to the municipal sewerage&#13;
network, and those that are not connected appear not to generate significant effluents, relative to the&#13;
myriad of other sources.&#13;
4.    Restoration Strategy. To reverse the effects of environmental degradation, restoration of the&#13;
Beira Lake has been accorded high priority by GOSL. Various studies regarding the water quality of&#13;
the lake, sources of pollution and options for mitigation have been carried in recent years. Under the&#13;
MEIP, IDA and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) financed a comprehensive&#13;
study with the objective of formulating a series of practical interventions. The study recommended a&#13;
10-year, two-phase restoration strategy to achieve the following goals:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
improve the sanitary condition of the lake in order to reduce the risk of health hazards to&#13;
those persons carrying out activities involving limited water contact;&#13;
- remedy the problem of periodic bad smells;&#13;
- provide water conditions capable of supporting living healthu aquatic communities; and&#13;
- improve the aesthetic aspects of the lake and its shoreline.&#13;
Phase I would fccus on reducing pollutant loadings, mainly sewage, from the lake catchment area and&#13;
on creation of monitoring and enforcement programs; Phase II would aim at accelerating the lake's&#13;
restoration using three in-lake restoration techniques: dredging the lake's sediments; filtration of algae,&#13;
and stocking of algae-eating fish.&#13;
5.    The reduction of pollutant loadings arriving from the lake's catchment area is the first and&#13;
critical step to achieve successful and sustainable restoration. Specific interventions to be implemented&#13;
under pha',e I include:&#13;
(a)   reduction of pollutant loadings through:&#13;
(i)   replacement of unauthorized wastewater connections to storm drains with&#13;
proper connections to the existing sewerage system;&#13;
(ii)    connection of septic tanks in shanty areas to the sewerage system;&#13;
(iii)   reduction of industrial effluent loadings;&#13;
(iv)    reduction of the frequency of sewerage system overflow;&#13;
(v)    improvement of solid waste management; and&#13;
(vi)    cleaning the shoreline.&#13;
(b)    monitoring program and enforcement including:&#13;
(i)    monitoring of water quality of stormnwater outfalls, lake water quality and&#13;
aquatic organisms; and&#13;
(ii)    enforcement of regulations governing wastewater and solid waste around the&#13;
lake's shoreline and catchment.&#13;
6.    Environmental Ouality Objectives. The environmental quality objectives proposed for the&#13;
Beira Lake restoration are summnarized in the table below:&#13;

Because of the presence of eAremely high faecal colforrns concentrations, the faecal coliforms obectives should aim towards a 1 00% reducto,&#13;
although in practice, there wil still be a residual presence of f,ecal coMforms.&#13;
7.     Component Description. The project would provide financing for the following interventions:&#13;
(a)    Interception of Illegal Connections. This sub-component aims at intercepting&#13;
unauthorized sewer connections and wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm&#13;
water drainage system and connecting them to the existing sewerage system;&#13;
(b)    Reduction in Sewerage System Overflows. This subcomponent aims at reducing the&#13;
frequency of sewerage overflows through cleaning sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping&#13;
stations, and adding a sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake, which is at&#13;
present unserved by sanitary sewrage system.; and&#13;
(c)    MonitoringProgram. To monitor the impact of the above interventions on the water&#13;
quality of the lake, a comprehensive monitoring program will be implemented under&#13;
the project. The parameters to be monitored, frequencies of sampling, laboratory&#13;
analysis required, and implementation arrrangement are given in the attachment to this&#13;
annex.&#13;

Beira Lake Catchment Pollution Control&#13;
MONITORING PLAN&#13;
1.    Context. Beira lake is a shallow urban water body which has no natural tributaries and for&#13;
which the main source of renewal comes from the runoff waters. Given the lake's present&#13;
cond;tions, it will take several years after the sources of pollution are controlled to have&#13;
observable results in the lake. In order to assess the impact of the phase I interventions, a&#13;
monitoring program will be implemented throughout the project duration and continue after the&#13;
physical completior of project-supported works.&#13;
2.    Objectives. The objectives of the monitoring program are to: (a) quantify the&#13;
improvement of water quality in stormwater outfalls discharging into the lake, (b) monitor the&#13;
lake water qulaity, and (c) establish a time series of lake's condition to enable assessment of&#13;
additional intervention required to accelerate the lake's restoration.&#13;
3 .    Scope of Monitoring. The monitoring program would measure the water quality of major&#13;
stormwater outfalls open to the lake and the lake itself&#13;
4.    Storm Water Discharges&#13;
(a)    Sampling Stations. The six major outfalls that drain almost 50% of the lake's&#13;
catchment and were monitored during the 1993 survey for the Beira Lake&#13;
Restoration Study are selected as sampling stations.&#13;
(b)    Sampling Frequency. Water samples will be collected at the above sampling&#13;
stations once every three months.&#13;
(c)   Parameters/Determinants.&#13;
-     flow rate&#13;
-     total phosphorus&#13;
-     total nitrogen&#13;
-     COD&#13;
-     BOD5&#13;
-     total suspended solids&#13;
-     faecal coliforms.&#13;
5.    Lake Water Ouality&#13;
(a)    Sampling stations. The 9 sampling stations used in the 1993 survey are selected.&#13;
(b)    Sampling Freguency. Once every three months.&#13;

-     faecal coliforms&#13;
-     chlorophyll-a&#13;
(d)   Annual Monitoring. Following the completion of phase I restoration works, the&#13;
water samples will be analyzed once a year against an expanded list of parameters&#13;
covering physical, chemical and biological aspects of the lake, similar to the list&#13;
used in the 1993 survey.&#13;
6.    Implementation. The UDA will contract a private or state monitoring/testing laboratory&#13;
to undertake the monitoring program. The analysis should be conducted according to the&#13;
Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (18th Edition; APHA, AWWA,&#13;
WPCF; 1992). Sample collection and preservation will also follow established methods. The&#13;
laboratory shall have previous experience in undertaking water quality monitoring programs.&#13;
7.   Reporting. The contracted laboratory will submit quarterly reports and an annual report&#13;
to the UDA.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
A. Solid Waste Mananement&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    CiOSL with IDA assistance has conducted a range of studies over the past ten&#13;
years in CMA designed to upgrade existing solid waste management. Among these,&#13;
included the identification of a new landfill site for disposal of garbage, alternative&#13;
disp osal through composting, safe handling of clinical waste and improving collection&#13;
service. The site for a landfill to serve 14 VLAs in CMA has been selected at Welisara,&#13;
north of Colombo. The compost plant will also be located at the landfill site. The&#13;
concep ual design 3f the site provides sufficient capacity for the waste produced in the&#13;
CMA for seven years, i.e. 3.5 million m3. The conceptual design of the landfill site&#13;
involves the following:&#13;
*  diversion of surface water courses;&#13;
*  excavation of peat/laterite to create void space;&#13;
&#149;  construction of a waste reception area;&#13;
*  phases basal preparation, construction and operation;&#13;
*  restoration as a raised landform.&#13;
2.    The site has been approved for development, and an Environmental Assessment&#13;
and preliminary geotechnical and other site investigations have been completed. The&#13;
contracting arrangements for the design, construction and operation of the site have been&#13;
agreed and the contractors will be selected by GOSL.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.    This Terms of Reference supports the implementation of the Solid Waste&#13;
Management Component. The scope of work is divided into five activities with the&#13;
following objectives:&#13;

Background&#13;
I .    The Urban Development Authority (Ministry of Housing, Construction, and Public&#13;
Utilities) is planning to undertake the development a fully integrated Geographic&#13;
Information System (GIS) to support the execution of critical operational functions within&#13;
a number of urban management and utilities operations authorities. The UDA envisions a&#13;
multi-function, computer based, information system capable of supporting operational&#13;
tasks related to the modemization of cadastral and other land records, the management of&#13;
infrastructure assets and facilities within major utilities, the execution of zoning and other&#13;
major urban planning tasks, the collection and management of information related to land&#13;
use and other land characteristics.&#13;
2.    The GIS project will build significant capacity within UDA for map generation,&#13;
relational database management, digital cartography, GIS analysis, and digital image&#13;
processing of remotely sensed data (primarily satellite imagery). The successful&#13;
implementation of the GIS will involve coordination among major data Providers and User&#13;

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
OF LANDFILL COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
I .    The Environmental Assessment of the proposed landfill site at Welisara was prepared by a&#13;
team of international and local consultants. The report has been reviewed by GOSL and IDA.&#13;
The following is a summary of the EA report.&#13;
Scope of the EA&#13;
2.     The disposal site for solid waste is proposed to be a single landfill site at Galudupita&#13;
marsh, Welisara, located approximately 10 km north-east of central Colombo. The landfill is&#13;
planned to have sufficient capacity to dispose of the solid waste arisings from the Colombo&#13;
Metropolitan Area for 7 years.&#13;
Public Consultations&#13;
3.     Public consultation was an essential part of the EA preparation process, and is a formal&#13;
requirement of both IDA' and the GOSL.2&#13;
4.     In response to these requirements, a program of public consultation and disclosure was&#13;
implemented by GOSL. During the course of the site selection exercise and the preliminary&#13;
environmental review of the selected site, two public meetings were held by the Divisional&#13;
Secretariat at Wattala, to which local residents were invited. A record of these meetings is&#13;
available in the main EA report. A local public consultation panel will be formed during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Analysis of Alternatives&#13;
5.     This section examines the alternatives available for solid waste management in the&#13;
Colombo Metropolitan Area. The key conclusions of the evaluation of options are:&#13;
World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 - Annex A (October 1991)&#13;
2 The national Environment Act was passed in 1981. Part Ivc (Gazette 772/22) came into force on 24 June 1993, and&#13;
stipulates the requirement for (I) an EA for prescribed development projects, (ii) the appointment of a Project Approving&#13;
Agency, and (iii) a 30-day consulation period following submission of the EA report.&#13;

* the development and extension of materials recovery is not feasible;&#13;
* composting is not feasible in the short term but, over the medium-long term, it is a&#13;
potentially viable component of a future MSW management system-&#13;
* incineration is not feasible;&#13;
* landfilling is feasible, and is the most appropriate technique to be applied in Sri Lanka.&#13;
The Proposed Option&#13;
6.    The technical feasibility of the options for solid waste management in the Colombo&#13;
Metropolitan Area are summarized in Table 1. Based on the evaluation described above, the only&#13;
feasible option for solid waste management in the Colombo Metropolitan Area is new landfill.&#13;
Through progressive screening of 6 different sites, the site at Galudupita marsh, Welisara, was&#13;
selected.&#13;
Overall Landfill Design Philosophy&#13;
7.    The proposed site at Welisara occupies an area of permanently inundated low-lying&#13;
marshland that is characterized by low topographic relief, a high groundwater table and periodic&#13;
flooding in the rainy season.&#13;
8.    Hence, the development of the site, although technically feasible, is likely to be difficult.&#13;
The nature and location of the site will necessitate the provision of a suite of engineering&#13;
measures in order to:&#13;
* operate the landfill facility continuously and successfully;&#13;
* incorporate the necessary environmental protection measures to minimize the risk of&#13;
pollution and flooding during site engineering, operation and upon completion.&#13;

Assessment of Environmental Impacts&#13;
9.    The EA provides an assessment of the potential positive and negative environmental&#13;
impacts resulting from the development of a landfill site at Welisara. On the basis of the&#13;
information available on the site described in Section 5 (main report), and the design concept&#13;
discussed in Section 4 (main report), the EA focuses upon the following:&#13;
(a)   the identification of the characteristics of the site with respect to the key&#13;
environmental issues, namely:&#13;
(b)   socio-cultural factors and land use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
(c)    hydrogeology and hydrology&#13;
(d)    biological factors (flora and fauna)&#13;
(e)    air quality&#13;
(f)   traffic&#13;
(g)    aesthetics (visual impact)&#13;
(h)    noise&#13;
(i)   the establishment of the sensitivities of the site with respect to the above, and,&#13;
hence, the scope for environmental impacts;&#13;
(j)    an assessment of the magnitude of potential environmental impacts which may&#13;
occur due to the development of the landfill site;&#13;
(k)   the features and mitigation measures which will be incorporated into the site design&#13;
to minimize potential environmental impacts and ensure that the overall impact of&#13;
the landfill is not significant.&#13;
(l)   the provision of adequate occupational health and safety measures within the&#13;
context of mitigation of the above categories of environmental impact.&#13;
Hence, the EA provides an appraisal of the environmental acceptability of the Welisara site for the&#13;
development of the landfill.&#13;
Socio-Cultural Environment and Land Use&#13;
10.   Key Issues. The key socio-cultural issues related to the proposed landfill are the following.&#13;
(a)    Resettlement of the population directly displaced by the landfill, due to the&#13;
landtake requirements of the landfill site.&#13;
(b)    Changes to the socio-economic status of the area, due to the positive effect of&#13;
potential employment for local people generated by the development of the landfill&#13;
site and following its restoration, and the impact of negative perceptions of the&#13;
landfill site in the area. Solid waste disposal in Sri Lanka has a poor reputation,&#13;
due to the pollution caused by the existing landfill site in Colombo. It is also&#13;
perceived by some as associated with the influx of scavengers and low income&#13;
populations, who derive income from sorting through the waste for recyclables or&#13;
hope for resettlement opportunities as the site develops. Scavenging may also&#13;
provide a source of income to some members of the local population.&#13;
(c)    Alterations in the public health status of the area as a result of the elimination of&#13;
water-borne vectors in the marshland area versus the potential increase in other&#13;
vectors (such as rats, flies, scavenging birds, wild dogs and cats) that may be&#13;
attracted by the landfill if not properly managed.&#13;

Assessment of Impacts&#13;
11.     The development of the landfill will have both positive and negative impacts on the socio-&#13;
economic conditions of the local community. These impacts are summarized in Table 2 with&#13;
respect to the key issues highlighted above.&#13;

:of the marsh                        :birds, dogs and cats)&#13;
Hydrology and Hydrogeology&#13;
12.     Key Issues. The key hydrogeological and hydrological issues related to the proposed&#13;
landfill site are:&#13;
(a)     the potential for contamination of water resources (surface water and&#13;
groundwater), by discharges, for example fuel spillages and waste construction&#13;
materials, during construction of the landfill site or escape of leachate during&#13;
operation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 6-of 16&#13;
(b)    changes to the flood storage capacity of the catchment of the Kalu Oya (river) and&#13;
its tributaries, which may lead to increased flooding either upstream or&#13;
downstream of the site;&#13;
(c)    changes to the drainage characteristics of the area, and hence the availability of&#13;
groundwater for extraction from wells by the local population and industry.&#13;
13.   The important aspects of the site with respect to these issues are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The local population make use of near-surface groundwater through shallow wells,&#13;
as well as abstracting water and fishing in the Kalu Oya and its tributaries. It is&#13;
understood that industrial enterprises in the area may also abstract water via wells&#13;
for industrial purposes.&#13;
(b)    The marsh land present on the site acts, as does most of the land adjacent to the&#13;
rivers in this particular catchment, as a flow regulating mechanism, by providing&#13;
flood storage capacity and a buffer during periods of high rainfall. However, the&#13;
total site area is 124 hectares, which represents only 2% of the total catchment&#13;
area.&#13;
14.    The protection of groundwater resources in this low lying area, and/or the provision of&#13;
alternative piped water supplies suitable for potable and industrial uses, is essential. The design of&#13;
the landfill will incorporate a range of environmental protection measures which will address these&#13;
issues and minimize the potential impacts.&#13;
Biological Factors&#13;
15.    Key Issues. The key biological issues related to the proposed landfill site are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The landtake requirements for the site, which will result in a maximum of 124&#13;
hectares of marshland being lost to the landfilling operations, with the result that&#13;
(progressively) drier, more elevated land will be generated as waste is placed,&#13;
covered and restored in phases.&#13;
(a)    Disturbance to the fauna (though not of significant ecological importance) of&#13;
surrounding areas near to the landfill site, due to noise, traffic, etc. associated with&#13;
the landfilling operations.&#13;
(b)    Disruption to the habitats present on low-lying areas in the vicinity of the site, due&#13;
to changes in their drainage characteristics caused by the landfill site altering the&#13;
hydrology of the area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
(c)    Disruption to habitats resulting from diversion of the stream that currently&#13;
traverses the site.&#13;
(d)    The scope for improving/generating new habitats of conservation interest, as part&#13;
of the landscaping and restoration of the landfill site, during construction,&#13;
operation and after the site is completed.&#13;
Air Quality&#13;
16.   Key Issues. The key air quality issues related to the proposed landfill site are:&#13;
(a)    generation of odor, due to the production of gases by the decomposition of waste&#13;
during landfill operations and after it has been deposited;&#13;
(b)    suspension of dust, due to the landfilling activities, especially vehicle movements&#13;
and operations associated with site preparation, excavation and drying of peat,&#13;
waste deposit and cover/restoration;&#13;
(c)    effects of vehicle emissions, due to the traffic associated with the landfill&#13;
operations.&#13;
17.   The incorporation of suitable mitigation measures into the landfill design, together with&#13;
the stringent site supervision recommended, is considered to minimize the potential impacts on air&#13;
quality and ensure that there is no significant loss of amenity.&#13;
Traffic&#13;
18.   Key Issues. The key traffic issues related to the proposed landfill site are:&#13;
(a)    disturbance to the settlements near to Galudupita Road and the access road to the&#13;
site, due to disruption of other road users (congestion, delays, etc), disturbance by&#13;
engine noise and air pollution from vehicle exhausts.&#13;
(b)    disturbance to local fauna (typically common species only) near to the access road&#13;
to the site, due to engine noise.&#13;
19.   The presence of settlements near to the road indicates that increases in congestion and the&#13;
increased risk of accidents, disturbance by noise and the impacts of air pollution are the important&#13;
traffic issues. These issues will be especially important in relation to the overall delivery of waste,&#13;
the option of delivering the bulk containers of waste from the transfer station at night and/or if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
traffic movements are required over week-ends. However, these impacts will be minimized by the&#13;
following operational considerations at the landfill site.&#13;
(a)   scheduling of traffic to avoid the peak periods on the local roads (07:00-09:00,&#13;
13:00-14:00 and 17:00-19:00), as well as evenings, night-time and week-ends&#13;
wherever possible (bearing in mind that night-time delivery of bulk containers is a&#13;
preferred option);&#13;
(b)   improvements to Galudupita Road, such as widening, resurfacing, curbing,&#13;
construction of pedestrian walkways, etc, which will increase the carrying capacity&#13;
of the road and improve road safety, especially with respect to pedestrians and&#13;
cyclists;&#13;
(c)    bunding, screening and landscaping between the new site access roads off&#13;
Galudupita Road and the adjacent settlements, to reduce noise. A minimum&#13;
separation of 50 m between the site access road and the nearest settlement is&#13;
proposed.&#13;
(d)   improvements to the junction of Galudupita Road and the A3 highway, for&#13;
example widening the turn, new traffic control measures/signals, signs in three&#13;
languages etc., to ease traffic flows and congestion and improve road safety.&#13;
Aesthetic Appeal&#13;
20.   Key Issues. The key aesthetic issues associated with the proposed landfill site are:&#13;
(a)   the visual impact on local settlements, due to the loss of up to 124 hectares of&#13;
open marshland and replacement by the operational, and later the restored, landfill&#13;
site. These impacts may include the loss of landscape features, changes to the&#13;
overall character of the area and development of new features as a result of the&#13;
development of the site;&#13;
(b)   the visual impact on travelers on the railway on the eastern boundary of the site,&#13;
due to similar reasons to those indicated above;&#13;
(c)   litter nuisance, due to waste/debris being blown by the wind off the landfill site and&#13;
from uncovered vehicles delivering waste, for example tractor trailers. The&#13;
potential effects include direct impacts arising from items of waste being dispersed&#13;
onto adjacent land-owners properties as well as more general loss of visual&#13;
amenity from unsightly accumulations of litter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 9 of 16&#13;
21.   The development of the landfill site will incorporate a range of measures to screen the&#13;
settlements and railway line from the operational areas, preserve the overall appearance of the&#13;
area and to minimize litter generation and any associated impacts. The scheme will include a&#13;
range of landscaping proposals which will minimize the visual impact during operation and return&#13;
the land to a beneficial use upon completion of the landfilling operations. Therefore, although the&#13;
development will involve a major change to the outlook of the site and immediately surrounding&#13;
area, the overall proposals are not considered likely to cause a significant impact on the aesthetics&#13;
of the area.&#13;
Noise&#13;
22.   Key Issues. The key noise issues related to the proposed landfill site are:&#13;
(a)    disturbance to people living in the settlements near to the site, due to noise from&#13;
on-site activities, for example earth-moving plant, large volume trucks delivering&#13;
construction materials, plant depositing and covering waste, pumps dewatering the&#13;
site, etc, as well as traffic entering and leaving the site. This issue is particularly&#13;
important if evening, night-time or week-end working is undertaken;&#13;
(b)    disturbance to local fauna in the surrounding areas, due to the on-site activities and&#13;
traffic.&#13;
23.   Due to the aspects of the site described above, noise is likely to be an important issue with&#13;
respect to disturbance of the local settlements. However, significant impacts will be prevented by&#13;
the incorporation of mitigation measures into the site design and operational procedures,&#13;
including:&#13;
(a)    provision of a bund and buffer zone between the settlements and the landfill site,&#13;
which will separate the working areas of the landfill from the nearest settlement by&#13;
at least 50 m, serve to screen the site and act as a noise barrier;&#13;
(b)   location of plant as far as practicable from settlements, for example dewatering&#13;
pumps, to minimize the effects of noise generation;&#13;
(c)    careful selection and operation of plant, to avoid the use of unnecessarily noisy&#13;
plant and ensure that the selection of plant includes consideration of its noise&#13;
emissions. Where necessary, noise enclosures/screening may be appropriate&#13;
around unavoidable relatively noisy plant;&#13;
(d)    use of on-site materials as noise screens, for example the location of spoil heaps of&#13;
peat between the operational areas and settlements;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
Annex S&#13;
Page 10 of 16&#13;
(e)   restriction of operating hours, to minimize the traffic and site operations during&#13;
quiet periods (evenings, night-time, week-ends, official holidays, etc. with the&#13;
possible exception of night-time delivery of bulk containers).&#13;
(f)   high standard of site supervision, training and maintenance of plant, since the site&#13;
management, appropriate training of workers in plant operation and adequate long&#13;
term maintenance of plant are all means by which noise emissions from on-site&#13;
operations can be reduced).&#13;
MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN&#13;
24.   The following Table 3 (taken from Section 7) summarizes the key mitigation measures&#13;
proposed to ensure that the development of the Welisara landfill does not result in unacceptable&#13;
residual impact on the surrounding environment.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR&#13;
PUBLIC CONSULTATION PANEL&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the residents of the CMA and visitors to the area.&#13;
At the end of the project, the environment in the area would be significantly improved through&#13;
improved garbage disposal, reduced industrial pollution and gradual improvements to the Beira Lake&#13;
water quality. It is appropriate that the citizens are provided an opportunity to influence the design of&#13;
the final outcome, on a continuing basis. Thus it is proposed to establish a Beneficiaries Panel&#13;
consisting of citizen representatives and government agencies.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2.    The specific objectives of the panel are:&#13;
a.    to promote awareness and public acceptability of the project components;&#13;
b.    to facilitate public consultation; and&#13;
c.    to conduct half-yearly review of project progress and make recommendations to the&#13;
Implementing Agencies and IDA; and&#13;
3.    Mandate. The Panel shall be appointed for a period of six years.&#13;
4.    Composition. The Panel will consist of 9 members and 9 altemates. Five of the nine members&#13;
will be from citizen groups and non-government organizations, while four will be government&#13;
representatives. The Panel Secretariat will be the PCU. When a regular member is not available, he or&#13;
she will be represented by the alternate.&#13;
a.    Panel Chair -- Secretary, MHCPU;&#13;
b.    A representative from the consumer or rate payers association;&#13;

PROJECT PROGRESS REPORTING REOUIREMENTS&#13;
1.-  During project implementation, CMC/NWSDB/UDA shall report project implementation&#13;
status through quarterly progress reports. Upon request, copies of ad hoc reports prepared on&#13;
matters of importance to project implementation and operations should also be promptly furnished&#13;
to lDA.&#13;
2.   Quarterly reports should be sent to IDA not later than one month after the end of each&#13;
quarter and should cover (a) procurement activities; (b) physical progress; (c) progress of&#13;
institution building technical assistance; (d) cost estimates, expenditures and disbursements; and&#13;
(e) management and operations of project beneficiaries. The scope and contents of quarterly&#13;
reports are indicated in paras. 5 - 12 below.&#13;
3.   During project implementation, CMC/NWSDB/UDA shall submit audited annual project&#13;
accounts together with auditors' reports within seven months from the end of the fiscal year under&#13;
consideration. The audit reports should include a separate auditors' opinion on withdrawals made&#13;
on the basis of statements of expenditures and from the project Special Account, and should be&#13;
accompanied by (i) reports on the sources and applications of funds for each project component&#13;
both for the most recent reporting period and on a cumulative basis; and (ii) reports summarizing&#13;
their respective key performance indicators for the fiscal year under consideration against the&#13;
targets as agreed with IDA.&#13;
4.   Within four months of the credit closing date, CMC/NWSDB/UDA will prepare and furnish&#13;
to IDA a Project Implementation Completion Report (PICR) on the execution and initial&#13;
operation of the project, its costs and the benefits derived from it, the accomplishment of the&#13;
objectives of the credit, the plan for the project's future operation and the lessons learned. Near&#13;
the end of the project implementation period, IDA shall inform GOSL and CMC/NWSDB/UDA&#13;
of project completion reporting steps and PICR data requirements.&#13;
Quarterly Project Implementation Progress Report&#13;
5.   Quarterly implementation progress report shall summarize the overall implementation status&#13;
with a brief description of important phases underway and planned, and highlight any existing or&#13;
anticipated issues, which may become critical to timely execution of the project. It shall provide&#13;
sufficient information on actual implementation progress for each project component covering at&#13;
least the following aspects:&#13;
(a)  physical work accomplished during the reporting period;&#13;
(b)  a comparison (in percentage terms) of actual progress at the end of the reporting&#13;
period with the original forecast of progress (SAR schedule) at this date;&#13;
(c)  changes, events or conditions which would materially delay the construction of the&#13;
project or increase its cost; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(d)  the expected dates of completion of the project components.&#13;
Text of the Report&#13;
6.   The text of the report should describe the work performed on each component during the&#13;
reporting period. Where appropriate, the text should include explanations of and comments on:&#13;
(a)  actual or expected material deviations from the original (or amended) design or&#13;
schedule;&#13;
(b)  any actual or expected event or condition which may affect the cost of the project;&#13;
(c)  actual or expected difficulties or delays, any measures taken or planned to correct&#13;
them, and the probable effects on the construction -schedule;&#13;
(d)  expected changes in the completion date of any major part of the project or the&#13;
project as a whole;&#13;
(e)  changes in key personnel in the staff of project implementing agencies or their&#13;
consultants;&#13;
(f)  any unusual occurrences affecting the progress of the project.&#13;
Tables and Bar Charts&#13;
7.   In addition to the text, tables following formats similar to those attached shall be provided&#13;
as part of the reports. Where appropriate, bar charts should be included to show separately&#13;
scheduled and actual progress on each of the main components of the project.&#13;
Procurement Activity&#13;
8.   Because of its impact on overall project implementation progress, procurement shall be&#13;
given special attention. In this regard, procurement table should provide as many relevant details&#13;
as possible, with complete lists of tenders for all goods, works and services to be acquired for the&#13;
project. The table should indicate all key actions, such as: (i) IDA's concurrence to bidding&#13;
documents as agreed under the Credit; (ii) prequalification of bidders as applicable to the type of&#13;
procurement involved; (iii) receipt of bids; (iv) bid evaluation and IDA's concurrence; (v) award&#13;

10.  The figures of "Original Estimated Costs" should be those used in the corresponding table&#13;
in IDA's Appraisal Report. The table should show any substantial changes in the cost estimates&#13;
that have become necessary since the previous report. The reasons for such changes should be&#13;
explained in the text of the report. Estimates should be reviewed and if necessary revised from&#13;
time to time. Such revisions may be necessary after important contracts have been awarded. In&#13;
any case, the estimates should be reviewed not less frequently than once a year.&#13;
11.  As the exhibit indicates, the report should show the amount of expenditures up to the end&#13;
of the reporting period, and the balance of expenditures still to be made to complete the project&#13;
on the basis of the latest estimated costs. Cost estimates and expenditures in foreign currency&#13;
should be shown separately from those in local currency, for each of the main items comprising&#13;
the project.&#13;
Quarterly Report on Management and Operations&#13;
12.  This should be a narrative report, supplemented by graphs or schedules if necessary. The&#13;
subjects which should be included are:&#13;
(a)  actual or prospective changes in key personnel in the project implementation units;&#13;
(b)  significant developments in the organizations and general operations of&#13;
CMC/NWSDB/UDA; and&#13;
(c)  the development of revenue collections.&#13;

            Improvement Project

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Colombo
            Environmental Improvement Project is to contribute to a
            sustainable environment for the long term economic and
            social development of the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA).
            Specifically objectives are as follows: 1) improve muncipal
            solid waste management and services in the Colombo Municipal
            Council (CMC) and participating local authorities; 2) reduce
            wastewater pollution in the Beira Lake catchment area and
            selected industrial zones; 3) develop the capabilities of
            local governments and institutions to plan and manage
            municipal services in a sustainable, environmentally
            beneficial manner; and 4) assist in mobilizing private
            participation in the development and operation of urban
            infrastructure services. The project comprises four major
            components. The first is a municipal solid waste management
            component which will support the construction of a sanitary
            landfill, construction of a 100 tons/day capacity compost
            plant the Welisara landfill, provision of potable water
            supply and other infrastructure for the communtiy residing
            adjacent to the landfill site and the purchase of equipment
            and vehicles for safe collection, transport and final
            disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill. The
            second component supports a wastewater collection system for
            construction of a sewer network in each of the two
            industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect
            and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two
            separate wastewater treatment plants built by the private
            sector. The third component supports a pollution control
            program in the Beira Lake catchment for the interception of
            unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm
            drainage system and connecting them to existing sewerage
            system and reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning
            sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping station, and adding a
            sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake. The
            final component is a technical assistance component
            consisting of project preparation assistance, project
            implementation support, technical assistance to the CMC and
            technical assistance to the Urban Development Authority.
