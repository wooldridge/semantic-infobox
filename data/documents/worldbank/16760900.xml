            Telling our story : climate change -
            private sector solutions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Climate change is one of the biggest
            issues in development today. While public policy is key, the
            private sector must also play a leading role. IFC can help
            business not just meet the challenge of climate change but
            build opportunity by widening and deepening access to
            technologies and helping support good governance, policy
            reform, and innovation. This includes: 1) offering clean
            energy investments that open markets with first-of-a-kind
            projects demonstrating technical feasibility, attracting
            private financing, and encouraging supportive government
            policy reforms; 2) supporting local financial institutions,
            leveraging domestic resources that would otherwise be
            unavailable for clean energy investments; 3) working with
            governments to promote frameworks that encourage
            climate-friendly investments; 4) developing and promoting
            innovative financial products that attract greater
            investment in clean energy; 5) helping private sector
            clients to identify and respond to financial risks of
            climate change; and 6) finding opportunities to address both
            climate change and poverty reduction, such as encouraging
            low-cost energy efficient homes and solar lighting.
