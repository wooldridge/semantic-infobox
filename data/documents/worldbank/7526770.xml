A. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1. Background&#13;
&#13;
1.     Prior to the July/August 2006 hostilities, Lebanon's water and wastewater sector was&#13;
characterized by poor service despite the availability o f relatively adequate water resources. Old&#13;
and deteriorated infrastructure and inefficient bperation and management contributec. to:&#13;
intermittent water supply (with some areas receiving water only a few hours per week);&#13;
unaccounted for water in excess o f 40 percent; and serious deficiencies in wastewater collection&#13;
and treatment, causing unsanitary conditions and contaminating surface and groundwater&#13;
resources.&#13;

*/ The Ein el Delbe water establishment covers the Southern Suburb of Beirut, which suffered severe damage as a result of the&#13;
recent hostilities; some suburbs are completely without water.&#13;
&#13;
2.    The most recent information indicates the level o f wastewater collection is estimated at&#13;
about 58% for the entire country, while wastewater treatment facilities, other than a few small&#13;
ones, are almost inexistent (see Table 2 below). Most o f the build-up areas and agglomerations&#13;
discharge their untreated sewage into watercourses or vacant land. The direct consequence o f&#13;
this i s the pollution o f streams and rivers, as well as pollution o f the aquifers. These conditions&#13;
constitute a real threat to the water supplies, imply serious consequences to the public health and&#13;
threaten the country's tourism potential.&#13;

&#13;
3.    In addition, the water and wastewater sector suffers from weak institutional capacity and&#13;
poor cost recovery. The sector's four Regional Water Authorities (RWAs - responsible for&#13;
water supply and wastewater disposal) remain severely understaffed and do not have the&#13;
appropriate resources to operate to an acceptable level. Inadequate cost recovery and the lack o f&#13;
clear and transparent mechanisms for setting tariffs have contributed to the weakening o f the&#13;
financial standing o f the RWAs. Even when the sector has witnessed increases in investments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
levels in recent years, it has not been accompanied with concurrent improvements in operation&#13;
and maintenance capacity, due primarily to lack o f resources linked to the inadequate tariff&#13;
structure and levels. The tariff structure i s based on a gauge system and not as a function o f real&#13;
amounts o f water consumed.&#13;
&#13;
4.    Inrecent years, the Government of Lebanon (GOL) has undertaken a number of key sector&#13;
reforms. A new water sector law (Water Law 221) was promulgated by Parliament inMay 2000&#13;
defining the role o f the Ministry o f Energy and Water (MOEW) to policy, bulk water supply&#13;
(both for potable and irrigation use), strategic planning and regulatory functions, while&#13;
consolidating the number o f water servicing authorities from 22 to 4 Regional Water Authorities&#13;
(RWAs - North, South, Beka'a, Beirut/Mt. Lebanon) in order to improve efficiency in service&#13;
provision. Initially these RWAs had responsibility for water supply and irrigation services;&#13;
however, an amendment to the water sector law stipulating the reallocation o f the wastewater&#13;
sector responsibilities to the MOEW and the RWAs was ratified by Parliament in December&#13;
2001.&#13;
&#13;
5.    However, these reforms have not yet achieved the desired results in part due to the lack of&#13;
institutional capacity o f the RWAs, which prevent operational efficiency and adequate planning&#13;
and prioritization o f investments, as well as due to the fact that the new sector law does not go&#13;
far enough to makethese authorities fully autonomous. Major reforms are still required inorder&#13;
to render the sector more efficient and self-sustaining.&#13;
&#13;
6.    Preparing a national water strategy, a national water master plan and water code will&#13;
provide a road map for the sector. Introducing a viable tariff and financial scheme, allowing the&#13;
private sector to operate and invest, and establishing an adequate regulatory framework are all&#13;
essential to sector sustainability. While a Board o f Directors was appointed for each RWA in&#13;
December 2001, the regulating decrees (by-laws) were not issued until1 October 2005.&#13;
Furthermore, no budget has been allocated to the water establishments to allow them to&#13;
adequately fill their organisational charts.&#13;
&#13;
Impact of the Julv 2006 hostilities&#13;
&#13;
7.    With the onset of the hostilities, the destruction of some water and sanitation facilities in&#13;
parts o f the Beka'a, South Lebanon and the southern suburbs o f Beirut has further exacerbated&#13;
the already-unsatisfactory service conditions. A preliminary damage assessment of the water&#13;
sector conducted by local consultants has put an estimate o f US$52 million for water supply and&#13;
US$13 million for wastewater. In addition, while no field assessment o f the socio-economic&#13;
impacts o f the destruction o f the water and sanitation facilities has been carried out, it i s fair to&#13;
assume that the risk o f diarrheal diseases from consuming contaminated water i s significantly&#13;
higher today than before the start o f the hostilities.&#13;
&#13;
8.    On the whole, Lebanon faces serious challenges in: (i)reconstructing, rehabilitating and&#13;
expanding its water supply and wastewater networks and facilities to increase service coverage&#13;
and improve water quality, (ii)  increasing the exploitable water resources through investmentsin&#13;
storage and reduction o f unaccounted for water, (iii)improving operation and maintenance, and&#13;
(iv) reaching adequatecost recovery levels and financial sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
9.   Prior to the outbreak of the hostilities, the GOL was about to present a comprehensive&#13;
Economic Reform and Social Action Plan      - one which would place the country on a growth path&#13;
with debt sustainability. Lebanon was suffering under the burden of servicing high levels of&#13;
public indebtedness, reaching US$38 billion or approximately 180% of GDP. However, the&#13;
economic outlook for the country was starting to show a positive trend, with an expected growth&#13;
rate of 6% in 2006 following a zero growth rate in 2005, as a result of the security and political&#13;
turmoil that followed the assassinationof Ex-Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.&#13;
&#13;
 10. The GOL's reform agenda (which aimed among others to deal with the high public debt&#13;
problem) remains not only relevant, but critical inthe aftermath of the hostilities lies at the core&#13;
of the GOL's vision for the country's overall recovery and reconstruction. The socio-economic&#13;
impact of the hostilities has given increasedurgency to this reform agenda, which now needs to&#13;
account for the substantially larger immediate needs of the population in a context of a reduced&#13;
revenuebase.&#13;
&#13;
 11. In the water and wastewater sector, the GOL, prior to the hostilities, had agreed with the&#13;
World Bank on a reform program that consisted at its core of: (i)involvingthe private sector in&#13;
the operation and maintenance of water and sanitation facilities, (ii)improving the institutional&#13;
capacity of the four RWAs, and (iii)pursuing the preparation of an adequate regulatory and&#13;
financial framework (e.g., designing of an appropriate tariff scheme) that will ensure the&#13;
financial and administrative autonomy and sustainability of the RWAs and enable the further&#13;
(and deeper) participation of the private sector in the provisionof water and sanitation services.&#13;
This reform program would have been implemented in parallel to much needed investment in&#13;
infrastructure inthe sector and it remains relevant inthe aftermath ofthe hostilities.&#13;
&#13;
12. The Government's Investment Proaram. In 2006, CDR prepared an investment program,&#13;
to be implemented between 2006 and 2010, based on sectoral visions which accounted for the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as operation and&#13;
maintenance of facilities and the institutional framework of the sector (more details of the&#13;
referenced investment program can be found in Annex 3). Under this program, the West Beka'a&#13;
was targeted by the GOL as a priority area for investment, with financing from the World Bank&#13;
and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) identifiedto finance water and wastewater investments&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The West Beka'a&#13;
&#13;
13. Among the areas that have drawn consistent attention interms of shortage and poor quality&#13;
of water is the Beka'a Valley and inparticular the western region, which has been long targeted&#13;
by the GOL for major improvements, but has not benefited until now from any significant&#13;
infrastructure investment inthe past 20 years. The population residing inthe western part of the&#13;
Beka'a Valley can be characterized as poor, with a high illiteracy rate of 35%' compared to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
national average of 8.8%,' and where unskilled, agricultural and unemployed labor represent&#13;
about 30%, 12% and 13% ofthe population respectively.&#13;
&#13;
14. The water supplied through network in the western Beka'a is estimated at about 20,000&#13;
cubic meters per day, which represents only 70% of the current water demand. Most of the&#13;
water facilities in the area are undersized and inefficiently operated; consequently, the Beka'a&#13;
Regional Water Authority (BRWA) for some time has had to resort to rationing water on&#13;
ongoing basis. Most residents rely on buying water to supplement their needs from tankers,&#13;
whichoften supply water ofpoor quality that is increasingly expensive for most area residents.&#13;
&#13;
15. Water quality studies indicate that the water being provided in the Western Beka'a area&#13;
does not meet the World Health Organization (WHO) standards or Lebanese drinking water&#13;
standards. Laboratory analyses of the water extracted from some of the existing wells (e.g., the&#13;
Loussi wells) show the presence of high levels of nitrates from agricultural activities and&#13;
wastewater seepage. Analyses also show that in several parts of the water distribution network,&#13;
the water is contaminatedwith fecal material due most likely to wastewater infiltrationand poor&#13;
performance of the disinfection system. As a result of the degraded water quality and inadequate&#13;
supply, a number of water-born diseases such as diarrhea are reported in the area, especially&#13;
among children.&#13;
&#13;
16. Until recently water supply in the western Beka'a was under the responsibility of the&#13;
Chamsine water authority, which was recently integrated into the BRWA. The BRWA which i s&#13;
now formed of the three newly-merged water authorities in the region (Zahle, Chamsine and&#13;
Ba'albeck), as well as regional water boards and committees, is still struggling to become an&#13;
integratedorganization.&#13;
&#13;
17. The institutional capacity of the BRWA is weak. The technical support unit for the Bank-&#13;
financed Ba'albeck Water and Wastewater Project (BWWP) has been providing technical&#13;
assistance to the BRWA, in particular to start implementing some of the actions outlined in the&#13;
Business Plan prepared for the BRWA in May 2005. However, progress has been slow, mainly&#13;
due to the fact that: (i)the new sector law does not go far enough to make the BRWA a filly&#13;
autonomous entity, and (ii)     the Managing Director of BRWA has not yet been appointed. The&#13;
lack of leadership at the BRWA is having a negative impact on its financial and operational&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
18. Inthe aftermath of the hostilities and the resulting government budget constraints, the GOL&#13;
sought to secure grant financing from the Lebanon Trust Fund set up by the World Bank and the&#13;
Kuwaiti Government, administered by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development&#13;
(KFAED), for the planned investments in water supply in the West Beka'a, while resuming&#13;
implementation of the already approvedinvestmentsinwastewater from the IDB.&#13;

C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Project development objectiveand key indicators&#13;
&#13;
23. The key development objective of the proposed government program for the West Beka'a&#13;
and World Bank-financed project is to alleviate the precarious conditions of the area's water&#13;
supply systems, which has been further aggravated by the recent hostilities and long-term&#13;
neglect. More specifically, the project is expectedto improve health conditions of the population&#13;
of the West Beka'a through the provision of non-contaminated water in increased quantities by&#13;
completely rehabilitating the area's water network.      The project should also contribute to&#13;
increased sustainability of the Beka'a Regional Water Authority through the regularization/&#13;
metering of large proportion of beneficiaries in the area, which are currently illegally tapping&#13;
water from the network.&#13;

3. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design&#13;
&#13;
27. The Bank's has had a long-term involvement in the water sector in Lebanon and has&#13;
provided assistance to the GOL inthe preparation o f a sector strategy paper which has served as&#13;
the basis for the agreed reforms that need to be carried out. In parallel, the Bank has been&#13;
financing the Ba'albeck Water and Wastewater Project (BWWP - US$43.5 million), for which a&#13;
mid-term review has been recently carried out. Based on this involvement and on the Bank's&#13;
overall experience on post-conflict reconstruction, the following lessons have been learned and&#13;
reflected inthe project design:&#13;
&#13;
0   Implementation arrangements:         Implementation o f other water supply and wastewater&#13;
    projects in Lebanon (with CDR) has experienced delays, mainly related to the bidding&#13;
    process and contract award. With the implementation arrangementcurrently inplace, CDR's&#13;
    Board has to approve every step o f the biddingprocess and contract award, which inthe past&#13;
    has typically resulted inlengthyprocesses. As such, the Bank has reached an agreement with&#13;
    CDR on streamlined implementation arrangements that will accelerate the procurement o f&#13;
    the sole civil works contract under Component 1, and that will empower the project&#13;
    management team with decision-making authority to accelerate the contracting and&#13;
    implementation o f the remaining project activities following World Bank procurement&#13;
    guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
    Capacity building for BRWA: Previous Bank experience in post-conflict reconstruction has&#13;
    shown that institutional capacity building efforts have invariably led to implementation&#13;
    delays complicating the implementation o f emergency projects.       As such, the proposed&#13;
    project has eliminated capacity building activities in its design. Key capacity building&#13;
    activities will be carried out under the institutional building component o f the on-going&#13;
    BWWP. Giventhe fact that BRWA i s still inits infancy and much more has to be done over&#13;
    the long-term to ensure that the BRWA becomes a cohesive utility that is sustainable inthe&#13;
    long-term. As such, the GOL recognizes that a long-term focus on capacity building efforts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    i s a key priority to improving the sector's sustainability, with efforts that will have to be&#13;
    continued beyondthe completion o f the BWWP being required.&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank's increased role inpost-conflict reconstruction over the past decade has provided a&#13;
    significant amount o f experience that can be relevant to this project. Now guided by OP2.30&#13;
    Development Cooperation and Conflict, the Bank's reconstruction efforts put a premium on&#13;
    early but selective engagement, flexibility in design and implementation, coordination with&#13;
    donors and other partners, and close monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, the Bank's recent&#13;
    experience in Iraq has highlighted the importance of a simple and flexible project design to&#13;
    allow for adaptation to changing circumstances. The proposed project has adopted many o f&#13;
    these lessons into the project design, including minimizing the number o f procurement&#13;
    packages, leveraging donor financing, Le., the Kuwaiti Government, through the Kuwait&#13;
    Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED), has agreed to finance on a grant basis the&#13;
    remaining portion o f the investment program.&#13;
&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. Institutionaland implementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
28. Responsibility for project implementation will lie mainly with a project management team&#13;
(PMT) formed within CDR. The PMT will be composed o f a project manager and support staff,&#13;
and will be responsible for the planning and coordination o f all project activities, including&#13;
procurement, supervision o f construction works and implementation o f the EMP.&#13;
&#13;
29. Given that the works to be carried out are under the jurisdiction o f the BRWA, there will be&#13;
a need for close coordination between CDR and the management o f the BRWA in order to&#13;
ensure a smooth handover o f the facilities constructed. In addition, CDR and the BRWA will be&#13;
responsible for coordination with the MOEW, in order to avoid a duplication o f efforts in the&#13;
activities implemented by the planned investment program and the project.&#13;
&#13;
30. CDR has recently launched the bidding process to select the consultants that will be&#13;
responsible for preparing the detailed designs and bidding documents for the entire water&#13;
investment program in the West Beka'a, with financing provided under the BWWP. The&#13;
implementation o f the civil works under the proposed project will be done under one contract,&#13;
which will be prepared by the selected consultants as a matter o f first priority. The Kuwaiti&#13;
Government packages will also be part o f the preparation o f the detailed design. All information&#13;
related to the design o f the Kuwaiti Government component will be subject to the Kuwaiti Fund&#13;
review and no-objection.&#13;
&#13;
2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results&#13;
&#13;
31. The PMT will provide quarterly progress reports that monitor the progress o f works&#13;
financed under the project, the number of house connections rehabilitated, and the number o f&#13;
additional people connected to the water network. In addition, these progress reports will&#13;
document the coordination efforts between CDR, the BRWA and the MOEW. These reports will&#13;
be submitted to the World Bank, the MOEW, the management o f the BRWA and the&#13;
management o f CDR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32. By mid-termreview and end of project, CDR will contract an independenttechnical auditor&#13;
to reviewthe implementationprogressas well as the quality of works and provide an assessment&#13;
of the project's intermediateoutcomes.&#13;
&#13;
3. Procurementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
33. The Grant would finance civil works, goods and consultant services in compliance with the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
34. The procurementmethod for civil works would be InternationalCompetitive Bidding. The&#13;
Grant is intendedto fund one works contract estimatedto cost US$13.75millionequivalent. The&#13;
procurement of goods would include mainly water testing and water quality monitoring&#13;
equipmentfor the BRWA, which will be procuredunder shoppingprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
35. The consultancy services for the design of the Works contract i s being funded from the on-&#13;
going BWWP. For consistency,the consultant would be asked to provide comprehensive design&#13;
servicescoveringthe entire scope of the program, of which the proposedWorld Bank Grant will&#13;
be financing a portion (Component 1).         The Grant will provide consultant services for&#13;
construction supervision, implementationof the EnvironmentalManagement Plan, carrying out&#13;
of the TechnicalAudits and support to the ProjectManagementTeam.&#13;
&#13;
36. CDR has had extensive experience in handling procurement according to the Bank&#13;
Guidelines. Lessons have been learned from implementingthe BWWP, and the inherentrisk is&#13;
foreseen to be moderate with respect to procurementprocessing. The PMT will be responsible&#13;
for monitoringandmanagement o f all contracts.&#13;
&#13;
37. CDR has developed a ProcurementPlan for the Grant for the Bank's review and approval,&#13;
which is included in Annex 4. This Procurement Plan would be an integral part of the Grant&#13;
Agreement and would haveto be updatedon a quarterlybasis.&#13;
&#13;
38.  The PMT will be responsible for maintainingaccurate procurement records, including all&#13;
actions related to Bank-financed procurement. This includes advertising, preparation of bids,&#13;
invitationto bid, record of bid submissions, bid opening, and evaluationof bids, contract award,&#13;
and contract administration. The procurementfiles and the updatedprocurementplanswould be&#13;
maintainedfor reviewby the Bank's supervisionmissions.&#13;
&#13;
4. Financialmanagement and disbursement arrangements&#13;
&#13;
39. A financial management unit - already existing within CDR - will maintain the Grant's&#13;
records and accounts, and prepare financial statements in a format acceptable to the Bank,&#13;
adequate to reflect the operations, resources and expenditures related to the Grant. The project&#13;
will be implemented by CDR and thus all Financial Management (FM) related matters will&#13;
follow the arrangements inplacefor World Bank financedprojects implementedby CDR.&#13;
&#13;
40. A financial management risk assessment has been conductedfor this grant and the risk was&#13;
rated as low based on the fact that: (i) CDR will assign a finance officer with adequate&#13;
experienceto follow up on the grant; (ii) the projectwill be usingthe same accountingsystem in&#13;
place for the BWWP and which is operational and adequate for the project's needs; (iii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
automatically generate from the system quarterly financial reports; and (iv) be subject to a yearly&#13;
audit by an external independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The project will follow the&#13;
internal controls inplace at CDR.&#13;
&#13;
41. CDR will assign a finance officer with adequate experience to follow up on the grant. CDR&#13;
can choose to assign a part time officer to work with the BWWP finance officer on grant-related&#13;
matters or assign a full time officer specifically for the Grant. The finance officer's role i s to&#13;
follow up on the Grant activities, post data in the system, prepare and monitor the yearly&#13;
budgets, prepare financial reports and coordinate with the project unit and the BRWA on all FM-&#13;
related matters.&#13;
&#13;
42. The projects' accounting system utilized in CDR i s a ring-fenced system with an integrated&#13;
procurement and financial management modules.         The accounting system i s governed by a&#13;
detailed chart o f account broken down by category, component and contract. The system has&#13;
beenoperating adequately under a number of projects and its outputs have been tested and found&#13;
to be satisfactory. The same system will be amended to reflect this project's activities but there&#13;
will be no change inthe system's main features and modules.&#13;
&#13;
43. The financial management unit will be required to prepare and disseminate quarterly&#13;
financial reports for the grant. These reports will follow the same format as the IBRD loan&#13;
financing the BWWP and should be submittedto the World Bank within 45 days after the end o f&#13;
each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
44. The project shall have the Grant's records, accounts and financial statements for each fiscal&#13;
year audited, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the Bank, consistently applied,&#13;
by an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank. The audit report should be furnished&#13;
to the Bank by no later than six (6) months after the end o f each year. The external audit report&#13;
shall encompass all grants activities and shall be in accordance with internationally accepted&#13;
auditing standards.&#13;
&#13;
45. The annual audit report o f the Grant's accounts shall include an opinion on the financial&#13;
statements and the special account transactions as well as a separate opinion as to whether the&#13;
statement o f expenditures submitted during such fiscal year, together with the procedures o f&#13;
internal controls involved intheir preparation, can be relied upon to support related withdrawals.&#13;
The auditor will also be requested to submit a management letter identifying any observations,&#13;
comments and deficiencies, in the system and controls, that the auditor considers pertinent, and&#13;
shall provide recommendations for their improvements. One combined management letter for all&#13;
World Bank-financed projects implementedby CDR i s acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
&#13;
46. To facilitate project implementation and make timely payments, the project unit will open a&#13;
separate US$Special Account at the Central Bank o f Lebanon with an authorized allocation o f&#13;
US$750,000. The separate account will also aim to keep the grant's transactions separate from&#13;
the IBRD loan. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
disbursementsguidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47. Transaction based disbursement will be used for this grant. Accordingly, requests for&#13;
payments from the grant will be initiated through the use o f withdrawal applications (WAS)&#13;
either for direct payments, reimbursementsand replenishments to the Special Account. All WAS&#13;
will include appropriate supporting documentation including detailed Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) for reimbursements and replenishments to the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
48. During implementation SOEs will be used for all expenditures relating to: (i)      works and&#13;
goods under contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO; and (ii)consulting services under&#13;
consulting firms costing less than US$lOO,OOO, and individuals contracts costing less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent. The supporting documentation will be maintained at the project unit and&#13;
will be made available for review by Bank supervision missions upon request. Documentation&#13;
relating to SOEs would be retained for up to one year from the date the bank receives the audit&#13;
report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal application from the grant account was&#13;
made.&#13;
&#13;
49. Eligible expenditures under this grant will be financed 100%from the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
50. Environmental Assessment. The project will finance the rehabilitation and expansion o f the&#13;
water supply system o f the West Beka'a region, including the construction o f a water pumping&#13;
station and storage reservoirs, transmission lines, drilling o f 6 wells (average 15 liters per&#13;
second) and the rehabilitation of the Chamsine Spring. The project has been classified as&#13;
Category By consistent with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01.              Potential adverse&#13;
environmental impacts during both construction and operation are expected to be restricted in&#13;
magnitude and severity. The project will have major beneficial impacts on the health o f the&#13;
population by providing them with good quality water.&#13;
&#13;
51. The potential benefits should outweigh any adverse temporary impact resulting from the&#13;
construction o f the water supply and distribution networks. It i s worth mentioning that the IDB&#13;
i s currently financing the construction o f sewage collection networks and two treatment plants to&#13;
be commissioned in 2008. This project covers a total o f 21 localities, including 2 in the project&#13;
area (El-Khiara and Haouche el Harime). Wastewater collection systems o f the remaining three&#13;
localities are expected to be financed under a proposed Italian Protocol, which has already been&#13;
negotiated with the GOL.&#13;
&#13;
52. An environmental impact assessment was carried out during the preparation o f this project&#13;
and is on file. It has been agreed with the GOL that public consultations will take place at a&#13;
suitable time during implementation. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) includes the&#13;
implementation o f mitigation measures during the construction and operation phases covering&#13;
water quality (monitoring) and quantity aspects, as well as institutional strengthening o f key&#13;
actors to monitor and supervise the implementation o f the EMP. A preliminary estimate o f&#13;
US$0.4 million has been calculated for the entire water investment program, o f which US$O.l&#13;
million will be financed by the proposed project. The remaining activities will be financed by&#13;
the Kuwaiti Government, through the KFAED.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53. Social. Modest acquisition o f private land will be required for some o f the sites for the&#13;
physical component (Component I)o f the project, which entails the construction o f water&#13;
networks and facilities. Therefore, the policy OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement will be&#13;
triggeredunder this project.&#13;
&#13;
54. Given that the exact/precise project construction sites for the above-mentioned physical&#13;
component have not yet been identified at this stage, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)&#13;
has been formulated by CDR to set out procedures for screening subprojects and where so&#13;
required, will guide the preparation o f individual site-specific abbreviated Resettlement Action&#13;
Plans (RAPS) acceptable to the Bank that CDR will submit as and when the project conditions so&#13;
require. The RPF will apply to any aspect o f the project that requires expropriation o f private&#13;
land or assets in the public interest, or the involuntary removal o f residences or economic&#13;
activities. The RPF ensures that the project fully complies with the Bank's safeguard policy on&#13;
involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12).&#13;
&#13;
55. The physical review o f the project area (World Bank mission accompanied by CDR and&#13;
BWA representatives undertook a visit to the project area to assess land acquisition-related&#13;
issues) indicates that the project will likely not induce any population disturbance nor lead to the&#13;
involuntary physical or commercial resettlement o f local inhabitants as the concerned areas are&#13;
currently uninhabited. Hence, at the present state, the project does not pose any threats to&#13;
incomes or livelihoods, nor does it create or intensifypoverty or vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
56. The completion o f the final project design will determine the exact location and size o f land&#13;
required for the constructions. A census will be conducted to identify the people that will be&#13;
affected by this land acquisition.&#13;

6. Sustainability and Risks&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
57. Building institutional capacity in the water and wastewater sectors has been identified as a&#13;
key priority for its proper management and operation, and the Bank is committed to assisting the&#13;
GOL in strengthening its water and wastewater sector institutions with financing to be provided&#13;
under the BWWP. Inaddition, the Bank team will, as part o f its ongoing dialogue with the GOL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inthe water andwastewater sector, provide assistanceto the government as it fwrther implements&#13;
sector reforms. The updated Government reform program for the sector i s attached in a matrix&#13;
format inAnnex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Risks&#13;
&#13;
58. Delays in implementation: Based on past project experience in Lebanon, specifically in the&#13;
implementation o f the BWWP, the project could face implementation delays. This i s being&#13;
mitigated by the agreed streamlined implementation arrangements that will be in place for this&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
59. Financing: The proposed project i s part o f a wider program o f reconstruction and expansion&#13;
o f water networks inthe West Beka'a, other donors are expected to be working in parallel to the&#13;
Bank on the program's implementation. Delays inthe availability o f financing to implement the&#13;
program are mitigated by the project's free-standing design.          At this stage, the Kuwaiti&#13;
Government has signed an agreement with the GOL committing itself to finance the remainder&#13;
o f the water investment program for the West Beka'a.&#13;
&#13;
60. Political and security risks: The current volatile political and security context in Lebanon&#13;
represents a risk to the adequate implementation o f the planned reform and investmentprograms&#13;
inthe sector.&#13;
&#13;
E, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
61. The implementation o f the project and the investment program for West Beka'a will help&#13;
improve access to clean water through the extension o f domestic water connection to a large&#13;
number o f people (estimated currently to be 200,000 for the investment program, and 49,000 for      .&#13;
the project) and address the problems related to the highlevels of water pollution ina regionthat&#13;
has average income levels below national averages.&#13;
&#13;
62. As such the program and the project will bring significant public health and socio-economic&#13;
benefits through better quality and availability o f water, improvements in the sustainability o f&#13;
water sources by reducing losses and wastage, as well as through the reduction o f the cost o f&#13;
water supply for low income families. Overall, the project i s expected to improve the quality o f&#13;
life o f the targetedpopulation, leadingto significant health and welfare benefits.&#13;
&#13;
63. Giventhe highpositive externalities for this type o f investment,the project i s expected to be&#13;
cost-effective. Since this i s an emergency operation, the economic and financial benefits o f this&#13;
project have not been quantified at this stage, mainly due to the limited time and availability o f&#13;
economic and financial data.&#13;

develop additional water resources in Lebanon. The plan was approved by the GOL and its&#13;
implementationstarted with the building of the Chabrouh Dam, with a number o f other dams in&#13;
tendering phase.&#13;
&#13;
In2006, CDR preparedan investmentprogram, which was to be implementedbetween2006 and&#13;
2010. This program was based on sectoral visions which accounted for the rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion of water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as operation and maintenance of&#13;
facilities and the institutional framework of the sector. The actual program CDR i s implementing&#13;
i s as follows:&#13;

CDR's 20-year development program would be difficult to fund entirely given Lebanon's macro&#13;
enconomic situation.         CDR's investment program has identified priority investments and&#13;
obtained funding from donors to implement most of the identified investments in water and&#13;
about halfof the needs for wastewater. Inaddition to wastewater investments, the Greater Beirut&#13;
Water Project (both resource and water supply) constitute the priority investment program for the&#13;
water sector.&#13;
&#13;
The Government's Investment Program for the Water and WastewaterSector in WesternBeku 'a&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned above, the Western Beka'a, has long been targeted by the GOL for major&#13;
improvements due to shortages and the poor and worsening quality of the water available. As&#13;
such, the CDR has conducted an analysis of different possible alternatives for supplying the&#13;
Western Beka'a with reliable and good quality water, which includedan analysis of financial and&#13;
economic aspects, including socio-economic impacts. Based on this analysis, the CDR, in&#13;
coordination with MOEW, has developed an investment program for the West Beka'a.&#13;
&#13;
This investment program encompasses the supply of about 41 villages in the Western Beka'a&#13;
region, with a current population estimated to be about 200,000 and projected to increase to&#13;
about 335,000 by the year 2030. The current water demand is 28,000 cubic meters per day and&#13;
expectedto reach 46,000 cubic meters per day by 2030. At present, this area is fed mainly from&#13;
the Chamsine Spring and the Loussi water wells, which are located within the drainage zone of&#13;
agricultural areas and are polluted. The investment program has been divided into four separate&#13;
zones, each to be supplied by distinct local water sources.&#13;
&#13;
Zone 1 Chamsine Spring, covering the following villages in two sub-zones: A) Western sub-&#13;
         -zone: with   a population of 49,000: El Raouda, Bar Elias, El Marj, Haouch el Harime, El&#13;
         Khiara; and B) Eastern sub-zone: with a population of 66,000: MajdelAnjar, Ed&#13;
         Dakoue, Es Salmiye, Tell Ez, Zaazaa, Soultan Yacoub, Ghazze, Mansoura, Saouri,&#13;
         Mazraat Es Saouri, Manara, Aita El Fowkhar, Soultan Yacoub el Faouka; and&#13;
Zone 2 - Abed Spring with a population of about 8,000, covering the villages of Aammil, Deir&#13;
         Tahnich,Aana, Tell Znoub, Tell Znoub Jdideh, Kefraya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Zone 3 - Kfar Zabad (well) system covering a population o f 27,000 and includingthe following&#13;
        villages: Kfar Zabad, Ain Kfar, Zabad, El Faour, Qoussaya, Deir el Ghazal, Raite,&#13;
        Massa.&#13;
Zone 4 - Southern zone covering 53,000 people in the following villages: Aazzi, Kamed el Loz,&#13;
        Joubb Jannine, Mdoukha, El Bire, El Mhaidthe, Er Rafid, Khirbet Rouha, Ain AArab,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Obiectivesand Structure&#13;
&#13;
        The objectives o f the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) are to identify feasible,&#13;
cost effective measures that may be used to mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that&#13;
might occur during the construction and operation of the project. The EMP of the proposed&#13;
project will consist of:&#13;
        Implementation o f mitigation measures; and&#13;
&#13;
     0  Monitoring and evaluation o f mitigation measures;&#13;
&#13;
1.Implementationof MitigationMeasures&#13;
&#13;
        Mitigation measures have been identified to ensure that the defined objectives o f the&#13;
project are achieved while preventing and reducing any adverse environmental impacts. The&#13;
mitigation measures are to be implemented by the contractors and the BRWA. The final design&#13;
process will detail and finalize construction drawings and tender documents o f the project&#13;
components.     This process will incorporate final review o f the designs by environmental&#13;
specialists to ensure that all required environmental issues are properly addressed and tender&#13;
documents include specific provisions concerning environment, health, and safety.&#13;
&#13;
A. Construction Phase&#13;
During the construction of the water supply network, the potential for causing disruption to&#13;
public activities i s the greatest. Monitoring during this stage will need to be continuous and will&#13;
cover traffic impacts, noise and dust nuisances, disposal o f spoil, and safety. Construction&#13;
mitigation measures will be required to minimize inconveniences to the public. Such mitigation&#13;
measures are standard and widely used in construction practices properly supervised for&#13;
achievement o f international standards o f quality. The general disruption duringconstructionwill&#13;
be mitigated by coordinated planning o f construction activities. This will include coordination&#13;
with all concerned authorities prior to the start of the construction activities. The contract with&#13;
the contractor will incorporate all requirements to minimize disturbance from construction&#13;
activities and will be monitored by the Supervision Engineer and the BRWA to ensure&#13;
compliance with the contract. The cost o f the mitigation measures during construction will be&#13;
incorporated inthe contract cost o f the contractor.&#13;
B. ODeration Phase&#13;
&#13;
The operation o f the water network can create adverse impacts, which need to be avoided&#13;
through the implementation o f mitigation measures. Responsibility for undertaking mitigation&#13;
measures during the operation will reside with the water facilities operator under the supervision&#13;
o f the BRWA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Water quality&#13;
&#13;
Water quality should meet allowable drinking water standards set by the Lebanese Government&#13;
and WHO. Among the parameters o f concern are the bacteriological contamination o f the water,&#13;
the concentration level of nitrate, the presenceofnitrite andthe concentration ofheavy metals. In&#13;
order to safeguard public health, it i s imperative that regular monitoring o f the water at the&#13;
sources, storage reservoirs and in the distribution network be implemented to ensure that&#13;
drinkingwater quality limits are not exceeded.&#13;
&#13;
Water Quantity&#13;
Mitigation measures during the operational phase will include:&#13;
       Responding to emergency leakage situations through an established procedure.&#13;
       Reducing unaccounted for losses through a comprehensive monitoring plan. The&#13;
       monitoring program will prohibit illegal connections to the water supply network and&#13;
       prevent system leakages.&#13;
&#13;
    0  The operator o f the water sources, chlorination units, and pumping facilities will adhere&#13;
       to the operation and maintenance procedures and manuals, and will conduct regular&#13;
       maintenance and monitoring to ensure that adequate output is maintained from these&#13;
       facilities.&#13;
&#13;
2. EnvironmentalMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
To ensure the performance, efficiency, and effectiveness o f environmental mitigation measures&#13;
programs, it is necessary that these activities be monitored. Monitoring programs will be&#13;
necessary for noise, air quality, and dust during the construction phase. During the operation&#13;
water quality monitoring will include chemical and bacteriological data.&#13;
&#13;
Compliance monitoring during construction will be the responsibility o f the contractor who will&#13;
be supervised by an Engineer on behalf o f the BRWA. Environmental monitoring o f significant&#13;
impacts during the operation o f the project will be among the responsibilities o f the BRWA&#13;
which will have the overall responsibility to ensure that the adverse impacts from the project are&#13;
maintainedto acceptable levels and corrective measures are undertaken when required.&#13;

            Lebanon - West Beka'a Emergency Water
            Supply Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The key objective of the West
            Beka'a Emergency Water Supply Project program is to
            alleviate the precarious conditions of the area's water
            supply systems, which has been further aggravated by the
            recent hostilities and long-term neglect. The project has
            two components with the first being the construction of
            water networks and facilities. The works implemented under
            this component consist of: (i) drilling of 6 wells in the
            vicinity of the Chamsine spring; (ii) rehabilitating the
            Chamsine spring catchment (concrete repairs, chlorination
            system, and installation of flow measuring devices); (iii)
            building a new pumping statio
