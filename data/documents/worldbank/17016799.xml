ï»¿Annex I&#13;
Description of activities and expenditure categories under the Project&#13;
Institutional Background&#13;
1. The institutional structure is based on a two-tier arrangement, involving an existing&#13;
Partnership (as defined below) and an existing Multi-donor Trust Fund:&#13;
2. The TerrAfrica Initiative for Sustainable Land Management in Sub-Saharan Africa (the&#13;
"Partnership") is a Global Partnership Program (GPP) established by resolution of the&#13;
Constitutive Meeting of the ExecLtive Committee of the Partnership held in Paris on&#13;
September 15, 2005.&#13;
3. The Partnership was established among partners including, at the time of establishment,&#13;
representatives of Sub Saharan African countries, international organizations, regional&#13;
organizations, bilateral institutions, scientific organizations and civil society. It is a regional&#13;
platform to enable governments cf sub-Saharan Africa, the international development&#13;
community and other global, regional and national stakeholders to better work together to&#13;
scale-up country-driven sustainable :and management. It is a collective and inclusive effort&#13;
for Sub-Saharan Africa which aims to foster long-term integrated and harmonized strategies,&#13;
policy dialogue and actions, building on the comparative advantages of partners.&#13;
4. Further to the decision of the Constitutive Meeting of the Executive Committee dated&#13;
September 15, 2005, the TerrAfrica Leveraging Fund (TLF) was established as a&#13;
Programmatic Trust Fund to participate in the financing of activities included in the joint&#13;
Annual Work Program (as defined below) of the Partnership. The TLF is intended to provide&#13;
a flexible financing mechanism to address targeted needs that are not already adequately&#13;
covered by existing funding mechanisms.&#13;
Governance Structure&#13;
5. The TerrAfrica governance structure is lean. There is currently an Executive Committee&#13;
and a Secretariat ("TerrAfrica Secretariat") now hosted by the Africa Union's NEPAD&#13;
Planning and Coordination Agency (NPCA). Ad-hoc working groups are convened among&#13;
partners as needed to assist on specific tasks (such as reviewing climate analytics, devising&#13;
plans for TerrAfrica's presence at the UNFCCC Durban conference in December 2011, or&#13;
vetting the Partnership's M&amp;E framework).&#13;
6. A joint Annual Work Program shall be prepared by partners and countries based on the&#13;
template of activities in the TerrAfrica Business Planning Framework, which is updated every&#13;
5 years in a process led by NPCA and approved by the Executive Committee. The emphasis&#13;
in the Second Business Planning Framework (2010-2014) is on climate change and SLM, in&#13;
particular the three priority SLM themes of (i) watershed management, (ii) conservation&#13;
agriculture, and (iii) linkages betNNeen energy and land. This focus was agreed by the&#13;
Executive Committee at its October 2009 meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&#13;
7. The TerrAfrica Partnership's Executive Committee is chaired by the NPCA and is&#13;
responsible for, inter alia:&#13;
Contiact number FED/2012/ 291-272&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(i)  Overall  guidance   and   strategic  direction  of  the   Partnership;&#13;
(ii) Review and approval of joint Annual Work Programs (as defined below) and&#13;
related budget and resources allocation prepared by the Partnership's Secretariat; and&#13;
(iii) Supervision of the performance of the TerrAfrica Leveraging Fund (which is&#13;
administered by the World Bank).&#13;
8. The Partnership's Secretariat reviews proposals of activities to be carried out by Partners&#13;
under the joint Annual Work Program (the "Annual Work Program"). Under the guidance of&#13;
the Partnership's Executive Commit:ee, the Secretariat consolidates the joint Annual Work&#13;
Program, and develops a budget allocating available resources to activities included in the&#13;
proposed Annual Work Plan and, inter alia, clearly delineating the proposals of activities that&#13;
would be eligible to receive financing from the TLF. In coordination with the TerrAfrica&#13;
Secretariat, the Bank determines which activities included in the proposed Annual Work Plan&#13;
are to be supported by the TLF. The Bank retains fiduciary responsibility for the TLF.&#13;
Objective and Description of the Actvities under the Project&#13;
9. Objectives. The overall objective of the TLF is to provide strategically targeted and&#13;
flexible financial support to:&#13;
(i) Strengthen awareness, harmonization, strategic directions on opportunities and&#13;
modalities for improved sustainable land management scale-up and effectiveness;&#13;
(ii) Improve and share analytical underpinnings to support policy dialogue and&#13;
decision making; and&#13;
(iii) Catalyze funding at country level.&#13;
To meet these objectives, the TLF provides strategic seed financing and other small grant&#13;
support for activities approved in the joint Annual Work Program. As mentioned above, the&#13;
recent and current joint Annual Work Program (2010, 2011) and the current Second Business&#13;
Planning Framework (2010-2014) Ell emphasize the linkages between SLM and climate&#13;
change. SLM is widely recognized by partners as the key approach to both mitigate and adapt&#13;
to climate change and variability in Africa. TerrAfrica has therefore been focusing much of&#13;
its support on the three aforementioned priority SLM themes of: (i) watershed management,&#13;
(ii) conservation agriculture, and (iii) linkages between energy and land. What these three&#13;
themes have in common is an emphasis on the landscape as a system that needs to be&#13;
managed holistically. In line with the joint Annual Work Program and the Second Business&#13;
Planning Framework, the TLF is expected to help deliver on the immediate objective of&#13;
scaling up sustainable and climate-smart land and water management practices on the&#13;
ground, in order to accumulate landscape carbon and help bridge Africa's climate adaptation&#13;
deficit.&#13;
10. Results. A simplified results framework is presented below. This results framework is a&#13;
subset of the Partnership's broader M&amp;E framework which guides the joint annual work&#13;
programming process and which guided the development of the Second Business Planning&#13;
Framework. Targets in the results framework below are somewhat fluid, given that the TLF is&#13;
seeking additional external support from existing and potential new partners, and is also&#13;
actively leveraging other sources of funding including IDA, GEF, other trust funds, and&#13;
national budgets. Targets could be revised upwards if additional contributions to the TLF are&#13;
made available or if parallel co-financing is secured. It is important to note that discrete&#13;
Conti act number FED/2012/ 291-272&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿activities will have customized M&amp;E arrangements calibrated to local circumstances, budgets,&#13;
and capacities. The specific results include:&#13;
Result 1. Countries scale up SLM practices in priority zones, in three key priority themes&#13;
of Conservation Agriculture, watershed management and energy poverty. This will lead to&#13;
multiple wins on the ground, including enhanced accumulation of carbon in soil and&#13;
biomass, higher yields and lower yield variability, access to more diverse livelihoods,&#13;
more predictable water availability, increased household access to renewable terrestrial&#13;
energy sources, reduced siltation of reservoirs, and in situ biodiversity conservation in&#13;
active farmscapes.&#13;
Result 2. Climate risk incorporated into decision making on SLM at Country and Regional&#13;
levels. This will lead to better knowledge dissemination and capacity building such as:&#13;
improved practical knowledge in sub-Saharan African countries about climate risk to land&#13;
and natural resource dependent I'velihoods (such as via ClimDev); improved knowledge&#13;
and capacity to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies through application of&#13;
appropriate SLM approaches; and better institutional performance on investment&#13;
planning, monitoring and knowledge management.&#13;
