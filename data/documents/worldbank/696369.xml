THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:              The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agencies:              Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ)&#13;
Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF)&#13;
Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC)&#13;
Beneficiaries:         Secondary Mortgage Facility&#13;
Housing and Urban Development Corporation&#13;
Participating financial institutions (PFIs)&#13;
Loan Amount:           US$20 million&#13;
Terms:                 20 years maturity, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard LIBOR-&#13;
based interest rate for US dollar-denominated single currency loans&#13;
Onlending Terms:       The Government would onlend to the SMF about US$19.6 million from the&#13;
proceeds of the Bank loan. The subsidiary loan would be denominated in&#13;
Jordanian Dinars and carry a market rate of interest. The interest rate would&#13;
be variable over the full term of the loan and the timing for resetting the rate&#13;
would be determined at the option of the SMF at the time of drawdown. At&#13;
each resetting, the new rate would be equivalent to that obtained by the SMF&#13;
on bonds of comparable duration within the preceding three months, or, in the&#13;
absence of such a rate, the rate on a ten-year government security plus a&#13;
premium reflecting the historical market premiums of SMF bonds over treasury&#13;
securities. The SMF would repay the subsidiary loan in accordance with an&#13;
amortization schedule similar to that for the Bank loan. SMF lending terms to&#13;
PFIs would be market-determined and, in the aggregate, would be made in a&#13;
manner that minimizes interest rate risk for the SMF. SMF loans to PFIs&#13;
would, at the option of the SMF, be for 3, 5, 7, or 10 year maturities, or other&#13;
maturities as may be agreed between the Bank and the SMF. Each SMF loan&#13;
to a PFI would be collateralized by PFI mortgage loans equivalent to 120% of&#13;
the principal amount of the loan being extended by the SMF. SMF loans to&#13;
PFIs would be repaid in full at maturity, without repayment of any principal&#13;
before maturity.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:       The proposed project is intended to support the Government's strategy  to&#13;
improve the efficiency of the housing and housing finance sectors, promote&#13;
private sector development in land and housing production, and reduce the&#13;
Government's role in both sectors. The primary focus of the project would be on&#13;
housing finance. Through the establishment of a Secondary Mortgage Facility,&#13;
the project would aim to improve the efficiency with which medium- to longer-&#13;
term financial flows for mortgage lending are mobilized, to facilitate and foster&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
competition in market-based mortgage lending, and to lengthen the term&#13;
structure of mortgage lending. Through the implementation of institutional and&#13;
regulatory reforms in the real sector, the project would aim to improve the&#13;
enabling environment for responsive private sector participation and competition&#13;
in land and housing development for lower income households. The proposed&#13;
Bank loan would finance: (a) a line of credit to the SMF of about US$19.0&#13;
million to support the first five year period of its mortgage refinancing program&#13;
(about US$141.0 million equivalent); (b) the establishment costs of the SMF,&#13;
comprising about US$200,000 for equipment and about US$400,000 for&#13;
consulting services, training, and technical assistance; and (c) technical&#13;
assistance services and training totaling about US$400,000 for HUDC, which&#13;
would be responsible for implementing the reforms in the real sector.&#13;
Benefits:              Principal project benefits, which may take several years beyond the project&#13;
implementation period to achieve, include: (a) better housing conditions&#13;
resulting indirectly from greater availability of medium- to longer-term&#13;
mortgage financing and from private housing development; (b) the financial&#13;
deepening of the banking system and bond market; (c) improved resource&#13;
efficiency in meeting the needs of the low and moderate income housing market;&#13;
and (d) a reduced claim on the Government's budget by the housing sector.&#13;
Principal beneficiaries would include: (a) low and moderate income households,&#13;
who should benefit from the lower costs of home ownership resulting from&#13;
increased efficiency in the real estate market; (b) most borrowers for housing,&#13;
who should gain from improved access to mortgage finance and lengthened&#13;
mortgage maturities; (c) banks and investors, who should be able to utilize the&#13;
SMF to gain substantial improvements in operational management and&#13;
efficiency; and (d) the Government, which should be able to reduce budgetary&#13;
expenditures and transfer much of the risks associated with housing&#13;
development to the private sector.&#13;
Risks:                 The major project risks relate to the SMF, which involves considerable risk&#13;
overall. First, there is a risk that loan demand from PFIs may not materialize as&#13;
early as forecast, or in the volume estimated. Second, there is a risk that SMF&#13;
bond operations to raise funds to meet loan demand may develop more slowly&#13;
than anticipated, either because it may take longer than anticipated for the SMF&#13;
to become proficient in bond operations, or because the market may take longer&#13;
than anticipated to accept bonds that are marketed without a government&#13;
guarantee. The SMF may not be viable without a guarantee of the initial SMF&#13;
bonds, subject to a sunset provision. This risk would be mitigated partly by the&#13;
amount of initial capitalization of the SMF, the ownership participation of the&#13;
CBJ, and the subordination by the SMF of debt service on the subsidiary loan&#13;
relative to payments on SMF bonds. Should any of these risks unfold, the&#13;
disbursement of the proposed Bank loan could be adversely affected. Overall,&#13;
the risks are considered acceptable when viewed in relation to the expected&#13;
benefits of the SMF, and in relation to the amount of resources being placed at&#13;
risk. Under the institutional and regulatory reform component, there is a risk&#13;
that internal opposition could weaken the Government's resolve to implement&#13;
the reforms, since they would reduce the public sector's role in land&#13;
development. Recent actions taken by the Government and HUDC should&#13;
mitigate this risk.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1.  THE HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTORS&#13;
A. Sector Background&#13;
1.1    Housing is an important part of the Jordanian economy; it accounted for about one-fourth to one-&#13;
half of gross fixed capital formation during the period 1985 to 1991. Excluding the refugee camps, the&#13;
annual demand for new housing units is estimated at about 22,000. The contribution of the construction&#13;
sector to GDP (in constant prices), of which housing forms an important part, averaged around 8 percent per&#13;
annum between 1988 and 1992. In the low income housing market, a 1993 Bank poverty assessment found&#13;
no major housing quantity problems, but occupancy rates of about 3.3 persons per room suggest some&#13;
overcrowding.  In the urban areas where about 70 percent of the total population live, overall access to&#13;
infrastructure services is high; however, the infrastructure is currently facing increasing demand and many&#13;
older networks have deteriorated substantially.2&#13;
1.2    Like many countries, Jordan for many years has pursued policies and strategies emphasizing public&#13;
sector responsibility for meeting the basic housing needs of low and moderate income households. In the&#13;
real sector, government housing agencies were established to develop and service land and housing; their&#13;
sustainability depended on preferential tax, fee and legal treatments, and priority access to government land,&#13;
property rights and subsidized financing. The public sector housing agencies were merged in 1992 to form&#13;
the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC), whose mandate includes the development, sale&#13;
and mortgage financing of land and housing targeted to lower income households, and also the formulation&#13;
of housing policy. In recent years, the Government has been reducing HUDC's direct production role in the&#13;
sector by largely limiting it to land development activities.  HUDC enjoys all of the privileges of&#13;
government agencies; has access to government land for development purposes; a government guarantee&#13;
against its debts; and authority to issue debentures. It currently has a staff of about 600, substantially in&#13;
excess of current needs, as well as a large portfolio of raw land and other real estate assets, and a financial&#13;
portfolio of subsidized mortgage loans. Its mortgage portfolio has been financed by loans and credits&#13;
funded by the Government, and is currently valued at about JD65 million. In recent years, however, interest&#13;
earned on financial assets has been HUDC's principal source of revenues, accounting for about 50 percent&#13;
of total revenues. Land development has accounted for about 25 percent of revenues. Its land holdings&#13;
range from a large number of small plots in developed areas with high values per square meter, to large&#13;
tracts in prime areas ready for development and large tracts in areas not likely to be developed for many&#13;
years.&#13;
/  Home ownership is high (about 75 percent), even for the poor; vacancy rates are high (11 percent); and the share&#13;
of permanent housing is also high (about 97 percent). Nevertheless, there are emerging problems that are&#13;
exacerbated by Jordan's high urban population growth and household formation rates (about 5.7 percent and 4.0&#13;
percent per annum, respectively). Average household size is now about 7.0 persons.&#13;
2 / Piped water is available to about 97 percent of the urban population but supply is intermittent for a significant&#13;
proportion of urban dwellers. More than 55 percent of all urban households are connected to the sewer system.&#13;
Solid waste collection is generally adequate, and about 99 percent of the population has access to electricity.&#13;
Primary urban road networks are well developed and generally of good quality, and access roads and internal&#13;
roads in low and middle income settlements are adequate in most areas. Upgrading in many low income areas is&#13;
nearly completed, with the exception of the refugee camps.&#13;

2                                                  Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reforrn Project&#13;
1.3    Similarly, in the financial sector, the Government has been intervening in housing finance thtrough&#13;
its sponsorship and subsidization of the Housing Bank (HB). HB is privately owned but with management&#13;
under the control of the Government. HB has been able to offer housing loans at below-market rates (as low&#13;
as 7 percent) and for longer termns (up to 15 years) than other banks because of a variety of special&#13;
privileges. In recent years, however, HB has increasingly acted along the lines of a regular commercial&#13;
bank, with direct loans to home buyers accounting for less than 15 percent of its portfolio. In 1996, the&#13;
Government is planning to introduce amendments to the Housing Bank Law to reduce most of HB's special&#13;
privileges. As discussed below, removing these and all remaining privileges is essential to the further&#13;
development of housing finance, but could also reduce the affordability of housing for low and moderate&#13;
income households.&#13;
1.4   In addition to supporting HB, the Government has provided below-market funding to HUDC for its&#13;
clients and also large amounts of low-rate or zero-rate financing for military personnel. The other banks,&#13;
particularly the Jordan Islamic Bank, make a modest amount of market rate loans, generally for fixed rates&#13;
for only 5-7 years, targeted primarily to upper-income households. Cash savings, particularly in the form of&#13;
remittances, provides the bulk of funding for housing. Overall, total housing lending is less than 10 percent&#13;
of GDP.&#13;
1.5    The subsidized housing finance provided by the Government has imposed a budgetary burden; in&#13;
1993, the present value of mortgage rate subsidy obligations held by the Government totaled about $67&#13;
million equivalent. The subsidies frequently did not reach the lowest income groups. The access of the&#13;
housing agencies to government land and subsidized government finance, combined with the absence of&#13;
strict market discipline, has occasionally led to major inefficiencies in the use of scarce government&#13;
resources. One large public housing scheme, for example, significantly misjudged the market, and required&#13;
a large government financial bailout of the agencies involved. Today, the Government wants to withdraw&#13;
from the subsidization of housing finance and also reduce its role in the real sector. The proposed project&#13;
would support these goals.&#13;
B. Policy and Institutional Constraints&#13;
1.6    An Incomplete Market in Housing Finance. Many of the conditions for an effective housing&#13;
finance system in Jordan are in place (Annex 1). The financial system includes the Housing Bank, 17&#13;
commercial banks and one savings bank, as well as the Amman Financial Market (AFM) which is becoming&#13;
a vibrant equities market. In addition, the macroeconomic environment and legal framework are conducive&#13;
to an effective housing finance system; inflation is less than 5 percent per annum, interest rates are&#13;
liberalized, and the legal system for foreclosure in the event of default is reasonably satisfactory.&#13;
Nevertheless, market-based mortgage financing has been relatively limited and confined generally to lower&#13;
risk mortgages for higher income housing. In recent years, only HB and the government housing agencies&#13;
have made mortgage financing available for the low income market, using various government subsidies.&#13;
The banking sector relies on deposits (mainly short-term) for funding because the primary and secondary&#13;
markets in bonds and other term securities, while emerging, are still underdeveloped.3 The shallow&#13;
securities market limits both the opportunities for the banking sector to raise term finance to fund&#13;
3/ Although the AFM has established systems for bond trading, the corporate bond market remains underdeveloped&#13;
primarily because of: (a) the market's traditional preference for equity; (b) stringent conditions in the Companies&#13;
Law for issuance of corporate debt; (c) a lack of credit rating mechanisms; and (iv) a customary expectation for&#13;
govemment guarantees on bond issues. Moreover, the practice of the Central Bank of Jordan has been to&#13;
repurchase govemment debt at face value. As a result, even private investment and commercial banks have not&#13;
been able to use bond markets to fund their term lending operations. However, in the Letter of Development&#13;
Policy for the Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL) (Ln. 3947-JO), approved on October 24, 1995,&#13;
the Govemment has committed to the implementation of financial market and legal reforms in 1996 that should&#13;
support growth in the bond market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project                                                3&#13;
mortgages, and also the liquidity of mortgages. The current market situation therefore constrains prudent&#13;
mortgage lending by the banking sector and thus the sector's willingness to engage in a greater volume of&#13;
longer-terrn mortgage lending.4&#13;
1.7    Role of the Private Sector. Although the formnal private sector dominates and operates effectively&#13;
in the market for middle and high income housing, the emergence of formal private sector solutions to lower&#13;
income housing problems has been hindered particularly by the private sector's lack of access to the special&#13;
privileges that have been enjoyed by government housing agencies, including access to land zoned for small&#13;
plot sizes, and special, lower cost building standards. Only small owner-builders and other informal&#13;
developers have also operated in the lower income housing market, many operating in accordance with legal&#13;
building requirements but some operating haphazardly outside the legal framework. Zoning practices have&#13;
distorted the land market available to the private sector, by setting aside most land in prime urban housing&#13;
areas for large plot sizes which are unaffordable to low and moderate income households, and which are&#13;
also inefficient in the use of available infrastructure.&#13;
C. Government Strategy&#13;
1.8    The Government's past reliance on government housing agencies to develop land and housing for&#13;
the lower income market has exposed the Government to significant commercial risks, allowed&#13;
inefficiencies to drain resources from the Government's overall development efforts, and undermined the&#13;
potential role of the private sector. Consistent with Jordan's emphasis in recent years on developing&#13;
sustainable, private sector solutions to economic problems, the Government intends to shift responsibility to&#13;
the private sector for developing land and housing for lower income households, and to implement measures&#13;
to mobilize increased longer-term, market-based financing for mortgage lending. Over time, public sector&#13;
activities would be increasingly reduced to policy, planning and research and basic upgrading works. The&#13;
proposed project would support the implementation of this strategy. The Government has recorded its&#13;
commitment to this strategy and to related policy reforms in a Letter of Sector Policy (LSP) (Annex 2).&#13;
D. Lessons of Previous Bank Experience&#13;
1.9    Since 1979, the Bank has provided support for three sites and services and upgrading projects. The&#13;
operations were successful in developing new housing, but required subsidies that tended to distort the&#13;
market, frequently did not reach lower income households, and hindered replication. The Bank has also&#13;
supported two municipal projects whose sustainability has been jeopardized by structural weaknesses (size,&#13;
revenue bases) in the targeted secondary cities. The lessons learned are that more fundamental, market-&#13;
promoting changes are necessary to ensure replicability and economic efficiency, and that these must have&#13;
the full commitment and support of the Government. The lessons are consistent with Bank-wide experience&#13;
that has confirmed the importance of several principles relevant to Jordanian circumstances, including the&#13;
need to separate subsidies from finance and to apply affordability criteria to the design of land use and&#13;
construction standards. The lessons have been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
2.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
2.1    The proposed project is intended to support the Government's strategy to improve the efficiency of&#13;
the housing and housing finance sectors, promote private sector development in land and housing&#13;
4/ Lending maturities are prudently short because of the liquidity and interest rate risks inherent in the potential&#13;
mismatch of the maturity structures of borrowing and lending. Only about 30 percent of the total number of loans&#13;
extended by the banking system carry maturities of more than one year, and only a small percentage of them carry&#13;
maturities over three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
production, and reduce the Government's role in both sectors. The primary focus of the project would be on&#13;
housing finance. Through the establishment of a Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF), the project would&#13;
aim to improve the efficiency with which medium- and longer-term financial flows for mortgage lending are&#13;
mobilized, to facilitate and foster competition in market-based mortgage lending, and to lengthen the term&#13;
structure of mortgage lending. The SMF is expected to make mortgage lending more attractive to lenders,&#13;
by permitting them to reduce the liquidity risks of medium- and longer-term mortgage lending, and also&#13;
possibly to access funds for housing at a lower effective cost. However, there would be no direct linkages&#13;
between SMF operations and lending for low-cost housing.&#13;
2.2    Through the implementation of institutional and regulatory reforms in the real sector, the project&#13;
would also aim to improve the enabling environment for responsive private sector participation and&#13;
competition in land and housing development for lower income households.&#13;
2.3    The project would:&#13;
(a)    Establish a Secondary Mortgage Facility, to: (i) indirectly promote medium- to longer-&#13;
term, market-based financial flows into the mortgage market by providing financial&#13;
institutions with a source of liquidity for their longer-term lending for mortgages; (ii) raise&#13;
aggregate financial flows by offering investors medium- to longer-tern bonds of&#13;
transparently low risk; and (iii) increase liquidity in the bond market by expanding the&#13;
supply of tradable longer-term securities; and&#13;
(b)    Implement Institutional and Regulatory Reforms, to: (i) reduce the regulatory barriers&#13;
that constrain the private sector from entering and competing in the lower income housing&#13;
and land development markets, and from responding efficiently and effectively to market&#13;
signals and needs; and (ii) reorient the role and mandate of the HUDC to be a facilitator and&#13;
promoter of private sector development of land and housing for lower income households.&#13;
2.4    Bank financing for the proposed project, including contingencies, would comprise: (a) a line of&#13;
credit to the SMF (about US$19.0 million equivalent); (b) funds to finance the initial establishment costs of&#13;
the SMF (about US$600,000); and funds to finance consulting services for HUDC's reorientation (about&#13;
US$400,000).&#13;
2.5    Features of the Secondary Mortgage Facility (Annexes I and 3).5 The SMF's draft charter was&#13;
reviewed during negotiations, and assurances were obtained that the charter would not be amended without&#13;
the prior agreement of the Bank. Following negotiations of the proposed Bank loan, the SMF was legally&#13;
established under the Companies Law on June 5, 1996 as the Jordan Mortgage Refinance Company&#13;
(JMRC). A Board of Directors comprising nine members including the Chairman has been elected. The&#13;
SMF has ownership participation by all key participants in the financial system (e.g., CBJ, HUDC, Social&#13;
Security Corporation and banks), and majority ownership is held by twelve private banks. The Government&#13;
has taken on a minority shareholding to ensure that the SMF is responsive to the needs of both bond&#13;
investors and mortgage lenders. The Chairman of the Board of the SMF would be the Governor of CBJ, the&#13;
Deputy Governor of CBJ, or another Board member whom the Governor has approved. The SMF's charter&#13;
prohibits any single bank (other than CBJ), or private sector participant, from acquiring more than 10&#13;
percent ownership of the SMF. The capital of the SMF totals about US$7 million equivalent. The SMF&#13;
would be the main beneficiary of the proposed Bank loan which would be on-lent from the Government&#13;
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (viz., subsidiary loan).&#13;
5/ The conceptual design of the SMF has been formulated in consultation with representatives of the Government, the&#13;
banking sector, the housing sector, contractual savings institutions, and the private sector, and with advice from&#13;
the Malaysian SMF, Cagamas Berhad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project                                             5&#13;
2.6   In accordance with its charter, the SMF would have two main activities and a very narrow mandate&#13;
to shield it from substantial risk. The first activity would be to refinance mortgage loans originated by&#13;
commercial banks and other eligible financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ)&#13;
(hereinafter referred to as participating financial institutions (PFIs)) on the strength of pledged collateral&#13;
consisting solely of mortgages on owner-occupied and rental residential housing, which generally comprises&#13;
the safest part of a bank's loan portfolio. The PFIs would be required to pledge as collateral an amount in&#13;
mortgages greater than the amount of the SMF refinancing loan (para. 3.5). The SMF would not accept any&#13;
risks associated with the original mortgage loans (e.g., credit risk, interest rate risk, pre-payment risk); the&#13;
ownership of the mortgages and all risks would remain with the originating PFI. Eligible PFIs would be&#13;
financially strong, privately owned institutions that satisfy the CBJ's capital adequacy requirements and all&#13;
other applicable banking regulations, and that have the institutional capacity to undertake mortgage lending&#13;
activities. The eligibility criteria for PFIs is summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
2.7    The second activity of the SMF would be to raise funds for lending to the PFIs by offering bonds to&#13;
long-term investors who, at the outset, are expected to comprise mainly the Social Security Corporation&#13;
(SSC) and possibly insurance companies. The bonds are expected to be offered and appraised in the market&#13;
without the advantage of a government guarantee. The SSC holds most of the long-term financial savings&#13;
generated in the economy through pension and retirement funds. Its assets currently total about $1 billion&#13;
equivalent and are invested mainly in short-term bank deposits, certificates of deposit, bonds and loans. The&#13;
insurance sector accounts for about 4 percent of the assets of the financial system. The maturities and terms&#13;
of SMF bonds would be matched to those of SMF loans to the PFIs, except for a spread to cover the&#13;
expenses of the SMF and a return on its capital. SMF loans to PFIs would be "bullet" loans, which would&#13;
not be prepayable before maturity unless the bonds issued by the SMF are also prepayable. SMF bonds are&#13;
expected to be nearly risk-free because they would be backed by mortgage collateral held by the SMF (para.&#13;
3.5). In addition, during negotiations, assurances were obtained that debt service on the subsidiary loan&#13;
would be subordinated by the SMF to payments on its outstanding bonds as a means of providing a measure&#13;
of confidence and security to potential purchasers of SMF bonds in the absence of explicit government&#13;
guarantees. In addition, the amortization schedule of the subsidiary loan would be similar to that for the&#13;
Bank loan to endow it with a maturity structure that would better qualify it as semi-pernanent capital.&#13;
Potential bond purchasers might also derive a measure of confidence from the CBJ's ownership participation&#13;
in the SMF.&#13;
2.8    During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the SMF would be exempted from  limits&#13;
imposed by the Companies Law upon the issuance of corporate debt. In this regard, the Government is&#13;
currently working on proposed changes to the Companies Law that would help to facilitate the further&#13;
development of the bond market. Pending their enactment into law, the Government has obtained the&#13;
approval of the Issuing Committee, as specified under the provisions of the existing Companies Law, to&#13;
exempt the SMF from the Law's current limitations on the issuance of bonds. In addition, by December 31,&#13;
1996, the Government would formulate and implement appropriate mechanisms to facilitate and streamline&#13;
the registration and transfer of liens by the SMF. Secondary trading in SMF bonds is expected to emerge&#13;
gradually among banks and institutional investors as their portfolio requirements change, either through&#13;
direct placements or through trading on the AFM, which would also facilitate bond purchases by small&#13;
individual investors.&#13;
2.9    During negotiations, assurances were obtained regarding the treatment of SMF bonds with respect&#13;
to both taxation and the liquidity reserve holdings of banks. Interest derived from SMF bonds would be&#13;
exempted from taxation in accordance with current tax laws. To encourage the development of the overall&#13;
6/ The CBJ has adopted the Basle guidelines relating to capital adequacy, and has also issued detailed guidelines&#13;
relating to classification of loans that are in conformity with intemational practices. Most Jordanian banks would&#13;
meet these requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                  Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
bond market, and in recognition of the SMF's low-risk status, SMF bonds would be eligible to serve as&#13;
liquidity reserve holdings of banks and would be risk-weighted at 20 percent for the purpose of calculating&#13;
the capital adequacy ratios of banks. This is expected to greatly enhance the tradability and liquidity of the&#13;
bonds issued by the SMF. The bonds would also qualify as investments for insurance companies and&#13;
pension funds. Assurances were also obtained that SMF loans to financial institutions would be treated as&#13;
interbank lending for regulatory purposes, on the grounds that SMF loans would be longer-termn than&#13;
deposits and have set terms.&#13;
2.10   Credit Demand. The cumulative demand for SMF loans by PFIs during the period of the project is&#13;
estimated to total around JDIOO million (US$141.0 million equivalent), or about JD20-30 million annually.&#13;
This estimate is conservative when viewed in comparison with the current stock of mortgages held by the&#13;
banking sector that could possibly qualify for refinancing, estimated at about JDIOO million (about US$140&#13;
million equivalent), and in comparison with the annual flow in mortgage financing of about JD35 million&#13;
(about US$50 million equivalent). Actual levels of activity, however, would depend on conditions&#13;
prevailing in the financial market and the extent of subsidized housing finance being provided through other&#13;
market participants.&#13;
2.11   Financial Analysis of the SMF (Annex 4). The financial success of the SMF would depend&#13;
primarily on whether lenders perceive the cost of and features of SMF funding to be attractive relative to&#13;
funds raised by deposit-taking. The net cost of SMF funds is projected to be somewhat lower than the all-in&#13;
cost of large deposits. This projection nets out the cost of meeting reserve requirements for deposits (at&#13;
least 200 basis points) from the spread needed by the SMF to cover its costs of operations (about 135 basis&#13;
points). However, investors in SMF bonds would require a higher return than on deposits to compensate for&#13;
differences in tenor, term of rate (if fixed rate bonds), and perceptions of credit risk. If this premium is less&#13;
than 70 basis points, the refinance rate of the SMF should be no more than the all-in cost of deposits and the&#13;
other advantages of SMF funding should be costless to the PFIs.&#13;
2.12   The second major consideration is the volume of refinancing. The operating and capital costs of the&#13;
SMF would be relatively fixed, and thus the required spread would depend on volume. The pro-forrna&#13;
financial projections assume a steady growth towards about JDIOO million in outstanding refinance after&#13;
four years from the start of operations, a volume sufficient to meet a profitability goal of a 15 percent after-&#13;
tax return on capital in the fourth or fifth year. This volume reflects a target of refinancing 40 percent of the&#13;
projected pool of eligible lending after four years from the start of operations.&#13;
2.13   Features of the Institutional and Regulatory Reform Measures.7 The proposed reforn measures&#13;
would support the emergence of an efficient private sector real estate industry responsive to the needs of low&#13;
and moderate income households. In particular, they would: (a) reduce the regulatory barriers that&#13;
constrain the private sector from operating in the lower income markets; and (b) launch a new Public-&#13;
Private Partnership Process to attract and promote private sector participation in land and housing&#13;
development for lower income households.&#13;
2.14   The principal regulatory reform measures comprise:&#13;
(a)    Granting full rights to the private sector to adopt and use the more affordable plot sizes and&#13;
building standards developed and used by HUDC in the past; all developers would benefit&#13;
7 / The features of the institutional and regulatory reform  component have been formulated by HUDC with the&#13;
assistance of consultants financed under the recently closed National Urban Development Project (Loan 2841 -JO).&#13;
Five restructuring studies have been carried out on: (a) the functional and financial parameters related to the&#13;
possible establishment of a private production entity (a potential altemative for HUDC that the Govemment&#13;
decided against); (b) HUDC's financial portfolio; (c) HUDC's land holdings; (d) HUDC's activities and staff; and&#13;
(e) the facilitation of private sector land and housing development. HUDC's recommendations have been&#13;
discussed widely in Jordan through housing conferences and seminars that it has organized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project                                             7&#13;
from improved zoning and development regulation, which should be capable of making&#13;
private development significantly more affordable;&#13;
(b)    Promoting, through zoning and re-zoning, the increased availability in the major urban&#13;
centers of residential areas zoned for Category D (300 m2) and E (150 m2) or smaller plots;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)    Simplifying and streamlining, by 1997, regulatory processes and procedures for land and&#13;
housing sector development such as permits for building and land development.&#13;
2.15   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, by December 31, 1996, the Government would&#13;
extend to the private sector, rights and privileges in land and housing development similar to those of&#13;
HUDC. Recently, the Government's Council of Ministers has approved the regulatory reforms and&#13;
announced them in the media. In addition, assurances were obtained that, by December 31, 1998, the&#13;
Government would submit to Parliament, legislation designed to make zoning for land use more responsive&#13;
to market needs and to improve the formulation and implementation of housing policy. For this purpose,&#13;
HUDC would initiate in 1996 and complete by July 31, 1998, a comprehensive study of land use and urban&#13;
planning management regulations, for which it would carry out extensive prior consultations at national and&#13;
local levels.&#13;
2.16   The centerpiece of the institutional reform measures would be a fundamental change in HUDC's&#13;
role and mandate from that of public sector producer of serviced land to that of policy formulator,&#13;
facilitator and promoter of private sector development of land and housing for low and moderate income&#13;
households. Recently, HUDC has announced its new role and mandate in the media and has begun to solicit&#13;
private sector interest in potential land and housing development schemes.  In addition, HIJDC, in&#13;
consultation with local land use planning and zoning authorities, has selected about 200 hectares of sites for&#13;
private sector development of lower income housing that are well-located to employment opportunities and&#13;
existing infrastructure, to help facilitate a quick start-up of private sector development operations. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that HUDC would establish by September 30, 1996, and thereafter&#13;
maintain an organizational unit dedicated to facilittting private sector dev4'opment of land and housing for&#13;
lower income households. In addition, HUDC intends to strengthen its accounting and financial systems to&#13;
help facilitate effective management planning and decision-making under the reform program. Assurances&#13;
were obtained that HUDC would, by July 31, 1998, enhance its cost allocation systems for each of its lines&#13;
of business and also establish budgeting and financial management systems to ensure full coverage of its&#13;
assets and liabilities.&#13;
2.17   To carry out its new role, HUDC would adopt a number of alternative approaches. One approach&#13;
would be to auction off to the private sector the rights to develop HUDC-owned land in accordance with&#13;
specified development criteria, such as the mix of plot sizes and price ceilings for housing units. Another&#13;
approach would be to solicit partnerships with private developers of private land, whereby HUDC offers its&#13;
expertise to facilitate design, implementation and approval processes.&#13;
2.18   Beginning in 1996, the performance of the institutional reform measures would be assessed mainly&#13;
on how well IJUDC attracts and facilitates private sector development in accordance with targets for&#13;
HUDC-facilitated land and housing development schemes carried out by wholly private sector-owned&#13;
developers (Annex 5). The targets for land developed under HUDC-sponsored private sector schemes,&#13;
relative to the total land developed under HUDC programs (including sponsored private schemes), would&#13;
comprise the following: in 1996, the greater of 20 percent of the total or 220 housing plots; in 1997, the&#13;
greater of 33 percent of the total or 400 housing plots; in 1998, the greater of 55 percent or 850 plots. The&#13;
corresponding figures for 1999 are 68 percent and 1100 plots, and for 2000 are 75 percent and 1250 plots.&#13;
To the extent that the minimums are not achieved in any one year, they would be rolled over and added to&#13;
the following year's targets. HUDC's own land development activities would be expected to decline over&#13;
time. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a) HUDC would take all measures necessary to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                 Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
achieve the above targets including, if necessary, the reallocation to private sector development through&#13;
auction or other transparent method, the development rights on HUDC sites; and (b) it would no longer&#13;
purchase or acquire, for development purposes, additional land exceeding an aggregate of 50 hectares,&#13;
except as approved by the Minister of Public Works and Housing.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.19   Bank participation in the proposed project would be consistent with two pillars of the Bank's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board on October 24, 1995. First, it would foster private&#13;
sector-led growth through the consistent application of policy and institutional reforms and market-based&#13;
interventions. Second, it would help to relieve critical infrastructure and public management constraints by&#13;
improving market efficiency and mobilizing the private sector to play a larger role in sectors traditionally&#13;
financed and managed by the public sector. Recent Bank sector work and lending operations have been&#13;
heavily oriented towards private sector development (PSD) and the financial sector. &#13;
2.20   In this particular project, the rationale and motivation for Bank participation is three-fold. First, the&#13;
Bank is among the best able of donors to bring international "best practice" experience to bear on the design&#13;
and implementation of a market-based housing finance system. Second, Bank support for the SMF is&#13;
expected to provide a strong confidence-building signal to the financial market, and enhance the willingness&#13;
of market participants to invest in the SMF and in its bond issuances without explicit government&#13;
guarantees. Third, the Bank's recent PSD sector work and operational experience in Jordan, when combined&#13;
with its substantial experience in the Jordanian urban sector, should enable the Bank to play a major role in&#13;
assisting the Government and HUDC to implement reformns to promote private sector development in the&#13;
low and moderate income housing market.&#13;
C. Project Sustainability&#13;
2.21   Recent PSD sector work has identified the need for major structural change to promote sustainable&#13;
growth, including measures to reform the financial system, promote the private sector, and reduce the size&#13;
of the public sector.  This project would pioneer such structural changes in the housing sector.&#13;
Sustainability would be promoted by improving important instruments normally found in the enabling&#13;
environment of an efficient long-term housing strategy. On the demand side, it would improve efficiency in&#13;
the housing finance market and help to enhance the affordability of mortgages through the establishment of&#13;
the SMF. On the supply side, it would shift greater responsibility to the private sector for housing&#13;
development in the lower income markets through regulatory reforms and the reorientation of HUDC's role&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
D. Project Objective Categories and Environmental Impact&#13;
2.22   The project objective is classified mainly under the category "Private Sector Development". The&#13;
project is rated under Environmental Category "C". Since the project would promote increased efficiency in&#13;
the housing finance system, environmental problems derived from sub-standard housing conditions should&#13;
8 / A recently completed Private Sector Assessment (Report No. 14405-JO) has identified constraints to private sector&#13;
development. A forthcoming report on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Municipal Finance Management is&#13;
expected to deepen the Bank's dialogue with the Government on housing sector-related, urban finance issues. An&#13;
Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (ESAL) (Ln. 3651-JO) is restructuring and incorporating energy sector&#13;
institutions under the Companies Law and creating the enabling environment to attract greater private sector&#13;
participation in the sector. Government monopolies in the agriculture sector are being eliminated under an on-&#13;
going Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) (Ln. 3817-JO). The on-going ERDL (Ln. 3947-JO) is&#13;
supporting reforms to liberalize trade and enhance competitive pressures in the domestic market. The ERDL has&#13;
been complemented by an Export Development Project (Ln. 3993-JO), approved on March 28, 1996, to help&#13;
strengthen Jordan's export competitiveness and increase export revenues.&#13;

Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project                                                     9&#13;
be reduced. The proposed project would have a beneficial impact on the environment through its&#13;
contribution to orderly regulated land development by private sector developers. New housing construction&#13;
facilitated by the project would be in established population centers which the beneficiaries themselves&#13;
would select, so displacement and relocation of residents would not be an issue. The building regulations&#13;
and codes governing urban development and land use planning, which cover the construction of housing&#13;
units, are adequate to ensure against environmental degradation.  Titles would be awarded to final&#13;
beneficiaries upon sale of the units, and construction standards are adequate to satisfy the building&#13;
regulations.&#13;
3.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.1    The total project cost is estimated at about US$142.0 million equivalent, including an indirect&#13;
foreign exchange component of about US$19.8 million, or about 14 percent of total costs (Annex 6). The&#13;
cost estimates include an SMF refinancing program aggregating about US$141.0 million equivalent over a&#13;
project implementation period of five years. The project cost estimate is provided in Table I.&#13;

3.2    The Government would onlend to the SMF about US$19.6 million from  the proceeds of the&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million (Loan) under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement having terms and&#13;
conditions approved by the Bank. About US$19.0 million of the subsidiary loan would be provided to the&#13;
SMF as a line of credit to refinance the estimated foreign exchange component of mortgages originated by&#13;
PFIs for the construction of new housing or for new renovations of existing housing. The mortgages&#13;
refinanced by the subsidiary loan are estimated to comprise at least one fifth of the total value of mortgages&#13;
refinanced by the SMF during the project implementation period. Private sector investors are expected to&#13;
contribute to the SMF refinancing program through the purchase of SMF bonds (about US$122.0 million&#13;
equivalent). About US$600,000 of the subsidiary loan would help to finance equipment and technical&#13;
assistance for the SMF (including contingencies). In addition, the Loan would include about US$400,000&#13;
equivalent to help finance consulting services and technical assistance for HUDC. Retroactive financing&#13;
totaling US$200,000 equivalent is proposed for expenditures made after August 1, 1995 in respect of&#13;
technical assistance and equipment for the SMF and HUDC. The project financing plan is presented in&#13;
Table 2. Overall, the Loan would finance about 14 percent of the estimated project cost.&#13;

3.3    The proceeds of the subsidiary loan to the SMF would be pooled with other funds raised by the SMF&#13;
through the sale of bonds, and then relent to PFIs in the primary market to refinance mortgages for both&#13;
existing and new housing. The proceeds of the subsidiary loan, however, would be earmarked for the&#13;
refinancing of mortgages for new housing or for new renovations of existing housing made not earlier than&#13;
one year prior to the date of the Loan Agreement. To be eligible for refinancing, the ratio of the mortgage to&#13;
the appraised value of the property secured could not exceed 80 percent. This ceiling would also serve to&#13;
preclude the subsidiary loan from financing land. Each mortgage beneficiary would undertake to occupy or&#13;
rent the mortgaged housing primarily for residential use.&#13;
3.4    The subsidiary loan would be denominated in Jordanian Dinars at a market rate of interest. The&#13;
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk on the subsidiary loan in return for the spread between&#13;
the IBRD rate and domestic market rates.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the&#13;
methodology for determining the market rate in effect from time to time would be agreed between the&#13;
Government and the Bank. The interest rate would be variable over the full term of the loan and the timing&#13;
for resetting the rate would be determined at the option of the SMF at the time of drawdown.9 At each&#13;
resetting, the new rate would be equivalent to that obtained by the SMF on SMF bonds of comparable&#13;
duration within the preceding three months, or, in the absence of such a rate, the rate on a ten-year&#13;
government security plus a premium reflecting the historical market premiums of SMF bonds over treasury&#13;
securities.10 The amortization schedule of the subsidiary loan would be similar to that for the Bank loan&#13;
(viz., 20 years including a grace period of 5 years). Debt service on the subsidiary loan would be&#13;
subordinated by the SMF to payments on its outstanding bonds (para. 2.7).&#13;
3.5    The SMF would enter into Participation Agreements with PFIs under terms and conditions approved&#13;
by the Bank. SMF lending terms to PFIs would be market-determined and, in the aggregate, would be made&#13;
in a manner that minimizes interest rate risk for the SMF. SMF loans to PFIs would, at the option of the&#13;
SMF, be for 3, 5, 7, or 10 year maturities, or other maturities as may be agreed between the Bank and the&#13;
SMF. SMF loans to PFIs would be repaid in full at maturity, without repayment of any principal before&#13;
maturity. Each SMF loan would be collateralized by PFI mortgages which are equivalent to at least 120&#13;
percent of the principal amount of the loan being extended by the SMF, and which have remaining terms of&#13;
at least 140 percent of the term of the SMF loan. PFIs would be required to pledge additional mortgages at&#13;
the end of each calendar quarter as may be necessary to maintain the level of collateral at 120 percent. The&#13;
maximum allowable level of arrears on pledged mortgage loans would be three months. The criteria for the&#13;
pledging of mortgage collateral is summarized in Annex 3. During negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
that the above mentioned SMF and PFI lending arrangements would be implemented. A special condition&#13;
9 /  For example, the rate could approximate 3, 5, 7, or 10-year fixed, market-determined interest rates, or be linked or&#13;
indexed to rates on a short-term financial instrument.&#13;
0 / A ten-year government security has been used as a reference because there are currently no medium-term&#13;
government securities traded in the market.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project                                           11&#13;
of effectiveness would be the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and the&#13;
SMF.&#13;
4.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.1    The Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Public Works&#13;
and Housing and comprising the Ministers of Planning; Finance; Industry and Trade; Municipalities, Rural&#13;
Affairs and the Environment; Agriculture; Administrative Development; the Governor of CBJ; and the&#13;
Director General of HUDC, would oversee implementation of the reform program and the Housing Finance&#13;
and Urban Sector Reform Project. HUDC would be responsible for implementing the institutional and&#13;
regulatory reform component of the Project. The SMF's Board of Directors and management would be&#13;
responsible for implementing the SMF component, but the CBJ would monitor this component during the&#13;
project period. Both HUDC and the CBJ have established Project Implementation Units (PIUs) for their&#13;
respective project components (para. 2.16). The two PIUs would monitor compliance with Bank guidelines,&#13;
procurement, schedules, loan covenants, performance indicators, expected costs at completion, and project&#13;
accounts (including commitments and disbursements), report on project implementation progress, keep track of&#13;
historical changes, and participate in Bank supervision missions.&#13;
4.2    During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the project would be carried out in accordance&#13;
with a detailed Project Implementation Plan (Annex 5) that includes target dates of actions to be taken and&#13;
monitorable indicators. The achievement of the development objectives of the SMF component could be&#13;
indicated by several events, such as the successful launch of SMF bonds without a government guarantee,&#13;
the volume of SMF refinancings, the occurrence of market trading in SMF bonds, and perceptions of an&#13;
emerging yield curve in the financial market spanning a period of about ten years. Important direct&#13;
indicators would include a lengthening of lending maturities and reductions in the gross operating spreads of&#13;
lenders. Progress towards achieving the development objectives would be assessed annually by regularly&#13;
surveying lenders as to their costs of funds, their rates and other terms for mortgage lending, the amounts of&#13;
such lending and also their narrative perspectives on such lending, by evaluating SMF activity, and by&#13;
monitoring activity in the market for debt securities. The survey of lenders would be designed under the&#13;
auspices of the project and conducted by the SMF. For the institutional and regulatory reform component, the&#13;
achievement of development objectives would be assessed primarily by monitoring how well HUDC attracts&#13;
and facilitates private sector development of land and housing for lower income households, relative to&#13;
agreed targets (para. 2.18).&#13;
B. Bank Supervision&#13;
4.3    Bank supervision is expected to require two missions annually during the five-year implementation&#13;
period of the project, including a Project Launch mission and a Mid-Term Review mission, both of which&#13;
would be heavily staffed. In total, supervision would require an estimated II missions and about 60&#13;
staffweeks (Annex 5). The Project Launch mission would hold a seminar with the PIUs, the SMF, and&#13;
concerned public and private sector institutions. Seminar participants would discuss the Implementation&#13;
Plan, including key dates and monitoring indicators; the responsibilities of the implementation teams;&#13;
procurement, disbursement, accounting and auditing arrangements; and reporting requirements. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that a Mid-Term Review would be convened by about July 1, 1998,&#13;
for which 1IUDC, CBJ and the SMF would prepare a detailed mid-term report by about June 1, 1998. The&#13;
Review would assess: (a) progress to date; (b) performance against monitorable indicators; (c) the&#13;
sustainability of the SMF and the effectiveness of HUDC's new role and mandate; and (d) the willingness of&#13;
private sector developers and banks to construct and finance lower income housing and also the willingness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                              Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
of municipalities to rezone land to allow smaller plot sizes. If necessary, adjustments to project components&#13;
and procedures would be made to improve project implementation.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.4    Goods and works financed by the Bank loan would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). Contracts for equipment and&#13;
materials for the SMF are not expected to exceed US$200,000 each and would be procured through&#13;
international shopping procedures based on the comparison of three price quotations from at least two&#13;
countries. The total aggregate value of such contracts would not exceed US$300,000 equivalent. All&#13;
equipment contracts valued above US$100,000 would be subject to prior Bank review. Under the subsidiary&#13;
loan to the SMF, procurement would be undertaken by the final beneficiary households and enterprises in&#13;
accordance with established local private sector and commercial practices, which are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Consulting services, technical assistance and training financed by the proposed Bank loan would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). For these assignments, there would be prior Bank review&#13;
of contracts with consulting firms valued at or above US$100,000, and also of contracts with individual&#13;
consultants valued at or above US$50,000. During negotiations, assurances were obtained regarding these&#13;
procurement arrangements.&#13;
D. Disbursement&#13;
4.5    The project would be implemented over a five-year period from the estimated date of loan&#13;
effectiveness, with a target completion date of September 30, 2001. The loan Closing Date would be March&#13;
31, 2002, six months after the project completion date. The projected disbursement period of about 5 years&#13;
or 20 quarters is shorter than the country disbursement profile of 6.5 years or 26 quarters. This is deemed&#13;
achievable because: (a) there are no major civil works or equipment contracts; (b) the institutional reforms&#13;
should be completed within the first 2.5 years of the project; and (c) the subsidiary loan is small relative to&#13;
anticipated demand. The estimated schedule of disbursements for the Bank loan by semesters is provided in&#13;
Annex 7.&#13;
4.6    The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table 3.&#13;
Disbursements under the subsidiary loan would be made against documentation submitted by PFIs&#13;
evidencing that the mortgages being refinanced are for new housing or for new renovations of existing&#13;
housing. For this purpose, PFIs would be required to separate out and certify to the SMF, those mortgages&#13;
for new housing or newly renovated housing that are included in the packages of mortgages that they submit&#13;
to the SMF for refinancing. Disbursement percentages for SMF mortgage refinancing would vary during&#13;
the implementation period, beginning with 95 percent of mortgages refinanced until US$4 million has been&#13;
disbursed, declining to 75 percent until an additional amount of US$6 million has been disbursed, and to 60&#13;
percent thereafter. The disbursement rate profile has been designed to help promote an efficient start-up of&#13;
SMF operations, and also to quickly inject in the SMF the proposed tier of quasi-capital (para. 2.7).&#13;
4.7    For the other components, disbursements by HUDC and the SMF for contracts valued at or above&#13;
US$100,000 for equipment, US$100,000 for consulting firm contracts, and US$50,000 for individual&#13;
contracts would be made on the basis of full documentation. For contracts valued below these thresholds,&#13;
disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE). HUDC and the SMF would retain&#13;
the supporting documents for disbursements under SOE and would make these available to Bank&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;

4.8    Special Accounts.  Operational procedures of the SMF may require that its loans to PFIs be&#13;
originated concurrently with an auction of bonds to investors. The Government would therefore open and&#13;
maintain for the SMF, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account for the SMF&#13;
components financed by the subsidiary loan. The Special Account would have an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$2.0 million. Applications for direct payment or for Special Commitment in respect of the SMF&#13;
components of the project would have a minimum value of 20 percent of the authorized allocation to the&#13;
Special Account. The Government would also open and maintain a Special Account for the HUDC&#13;
component, with an authorized allocation of US$50,000. The two Special Accounts would be replenished&#13;
on a monthly basis or when the balance of each account is equal to 50 percent of the authorized allocations,&#13;
whichever comes first. The withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate documentation,&#13;
including a copy of the monthly bank statements and their reconciliation with the Special Account&#13;
transactions.&#13;
E. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
4.9    During negotiationis, assurances were obtained that: (a) HUDC would establish and maintain project&#13;
accounts, and the SMF would establish and maintain financial accounts and statements, in formats&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; (b) both HUDC and the SMF would have their accounts audited each fiscal year in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines and by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (c) the audited&#13;
accounts would be furnished to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in such scope and&#13;
detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including separate opinions by the auditors on disbursements&#13;
made under the Special Accounts; and (d) in respect of the SMF, the Bank would be furnished with the&#13;
auditor's nar;agement letter or other reports which the auditors may provide to SMF management.&#13;
4.10    HUDC and the SMF wouid also furnish the Bank with detailed quarterly reports summarizing their&#13;
operations and the utilization of Project funds. The reports would follow a standardized format that would&#13;
be finalized during the Project Launch seminar. They would cover implementation status; deviations, if&#13;
any, from the Implementation Plan; problems and constraints, and the corrective actions being taken;&#13;
updated disbursement and commitment tables; and, in the case of the SMF, updated information on the&#13;
volume and terns and conditions of lending in the market. HUDC, the CBJ and the SMF would also&#13;
prepare a detailed mid-term report to serve as the basis for the Mid-Term Review (para. 4.3). In addition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                             Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project&#13;
HUDC, the CBJ and the SMF would submit an Implementation Completion Report to the Bank within six&#13;
months of the Closing Date of the Bank loan.&#13;
5.   BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1    Principal project benefits, which may take several years beyond the project implementation period&#13;
to achieve, include: (a) better housing conditions, resulting indirectly from greater availability of medium-&#13;
and longer-term mortgage financing and from private housing development; (b) the financial deepening of&#13;
the banking system and bond market; (c) improved resource efficiency in meeting the needs of the low and&#13;
moderate income housing market; and (d) a reduced claim on the government budget by the housing sector.&#13;
Principal beneficiaries would include: (a) low and moderate income households, who should benefit from&#13;
the lower costs of home ownership resulting from increased efficiency in the real estate market; (b) most&#13;
borrowers for housing, who should gain from improved access to mortgage finance and lengthened&#13;
mortgage maturities; (c) banks and investors, who should be able to utilize the SMF to improve their&#13;
portfolio management; and (d) the Government, which should be able to reduce budgetary expenditures and&#13;
transfer much of the risks associated with housing development to the private sector.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.2    Economic benefits have only been quantified for the SMF component for which an estimation is&#13;
given in Annex 8. The commercial viability of the SMF, as indicated in the financial analysis (para. 2.1 1),&#13;
does not by itself assure that the SMF would generate net economic and social benefits. However, an&#13;
indicative assessment of such benefits can be derived by estimating the value to banks and households of&#13;
having access to this form of financial intermediation, which should be reflected over time in the terms and&#13;
conditions under which banks would be willing to offer housing loans.&#13;
5.3    At a minimum, economic benefits are expected to accrue from: (a) for lenders, a reduction in the&#13;
liquidity risk associated with longer-term housing loans, thereby enabling a reduction in the price and non-&#13;
price barriers to longer-term borrowing; (b) for mortgagors (households), a combination of lower costs of&#13;
funds and a longer term on the mortgages being offered, as well as greater interest among banks in pursuing&#13;
more lending for housing; and (c) improved financial information in the capital market on term structures&#13;
and risks that should reduce the cost of issuing medium- and long-term corporate debt in Jordan. After&#13;
taking into account the estimated costs of SMF operations and of the capital committed to the SMF, the&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) is expected to fall within the range of 15 to 20 percent. However, the ERR is&#13;
sensitive to both the size and timing of costs and benefits and, at one lower bound estimation of costs and&#13;
benefits, the ERR could fall to about 10 percent, while at a higher bound estimation it could exceed 20&#13;
percent.&#13;
5.4    Other benefits of the SMF, which have not been quantified, are also likely to accrue. The SMF&#13;
could induce greater public awareness of the importance of analyzing credit risks in the absence of&#13;
government guarantees, and also possibly help the Government reduce the housing finance subsidies to low&#13;
and moderate income households which it has been channeling through a special window at the Housing&#13;
Bank.&#13;
5.5   Implicit in this analysis is the counterfactual assumption that the housing finance market in Jordan&#13;
would remain unchanged in the absence of the SMF. To the extent that other adjustments could take place&#13;
without the SMF, its benefits are overstated. However, it is difficult to discern signs that the basic nature of&#13;
the mortgage and bond markets would change anytime soon in the absence of this project. Banks have&#13;
reiterated their concern about the illiquidity of mortgage lending, the real level of government domestic debt&#13;
outstanding is shrinking, and bank syndications have almost completely replaced corporate bond issuances.&#13;

It is considered unlikely that a private sector entity would undertake to provide SMF services independently,&#13;
both because the external benefits cannot be captured entirely by a totally private sector entity, and also&#13;
because the major banks in Jordan could reasonably view such an entity as undermining their competitive&#13;
positions within the financial sector and therefore oppose it.&#13;
C. Project Risks&#13;
5.6    The most significant project risks relate to the SMF, which is an entirely new venture in Jordan&#13;
involving considerable risk overall. First, there is a risk that loan demand from PFIs may not materialize as&#13;
early as forecast, or in the volume estimated. Market behavior is difficult to predict in Jordan; the demand&#13;
for SMF funds would depend on many factors, such as the willingness of consumers to pay market rates for&#13;
term finance, the willingness of banks to pay a premium over the cost of deposits to defray risks of&#13;
illiquidity from mismatching maturities, the linkages between credit demand and private sector development&#13;
of land and housing, and operating costs of the SMF. Second, there is a risk that SMF bond operations to&#13;
raise funds to meet loan demand may develop more slowly than anticipated, either because it may take&#13;
longer than anticipated for the SMF to become proficient in bond operations, or because the financial market&#13;
may take longer than anticipated to accept bonds that are marketed without a government guarantee. The&#13;
SMF may not be viable without a guarantee of the initial SMF bonds, subject to a sunset provision. This&#13;
risk would be mitigated partly by the amount of initial capitalization of the SMF, by the ownership&#13;
participation of the CBJ, and by the subordination by the SMF of debt service on the subsidiary loan relative&#13;
to payments on SMF bonds. Third, there is a risk that adverse changes in the macroeconomic framework&#13;
could hinder SMF operations and the achievement of its objectives. The Government, however, remains&#13;
committed to and on track with its macroeconomic adjustment program. Should any of these risks unfold,&#13;
the disbursement of the proposed Bank loan could be adversely affected. Nevertheless, proceeding with the&#13;
SMF remains justified because the risks are considered acceptable when viewed in relation to the expected&#13;
benefits and the probability that the SMF would ultimately lead to greater financial market efficiency, and in&#13;
relation to the amount of resources being placed at risk.&#13;
5.7    Under the institutional and regulatory reform component, there is a risk that internal opposition&#13;
could weaken the Government's resolve to implement the reforms, since they would reduce the public&#13;
sector's role and privileges in land development. Recent actions taken by the Government and HUDC&#13;
should mitigate this risk (paras. 2.15 and 2.16).&#13;
5.8    After taking into account the nature of the above-mentioned risks and the actions that would be&#13;
taken to mitigate them, there remains a risk that unanticipated future events could adversely affect the pace&#13;
of project implementation and the achievement of the project's development objectives. When viewed in the&#13;
context of the project's expected benefits, this risk is considered acceptable.&#13;

6.2    The following assurances specific to the institutional and regulatory reform component were&#13;
obtained:&#13;
(a)   the Government would: (i) by December 31, 1996, extend to the private sector, the rights&#13;
and privileges in land and housing development similar to those of HUDC (para. 2.15); and&#13;
(ii) by December 31, 1998, formulate and submit to Parliament, legislation designed to&#13;
make zoning for land use more responsive to market needs and to improve the formulation&#13;
and implementation of housing policy (para. 2.15);&#13;
(b)    HUDC would: (i) by July 31, 1998, complete a comprehensive study of land use and urban&#13;
planning management regulations (para. 2.15); (ii) by September 30, 1996, establish and&#13;
maintain an organizational unit dedicated to private sector development (para. 2.16); (iii) by&#13;

introduce any measures required to improve project implementation (para. 4.3); and&#13;
(c)    HUDC and the SMF would: (i) establish and maintain accounts in a format acceptable to the&#13;
Bank; (ii) have their accounts audited each fiscal year in accordance with Bank guidelines&#13;
and by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (iii) furnish the accounts to the Bank&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year, in such scope and detail as the Bank may&#13;
reasonably request; and (iv) in respect of the SMF, also furnish the auditor's management&#13;
letter or other reports provided by the auditor (para. 4.9).&#13;
6.4    A special condition of loan effectiveness would be the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement&#13;
between the Government and the SMF (para. 3.5).&#13;
6.5    Subject to the agreements and conditions given above, the proposed project constitutes a suitable&#13;
basis for a Bank loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the amount of US$20.0 million at the Bank's&#13;
standard LIBOR-based interest rate for US dollar-denominated single currency loans, with a maturity of 20&#13;
years, including a grace period of five years.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Housing Finance and the Secondary Mortgage Facility&#13;
Overview of the Housing Finance System&#13;
1.     Most of the Jordanian population is relatively well-housed. The housing sector has not depended&#13;
heavily on forrnal-sector housing finance to accomplish this achievement. It appears that such financing&#13;
amounts to less than 10 percent of GDP, in contrast to a figure of 90 percent in the United States and 25&#13;
percent in Malaysia, a developing country with higher incomes and a more advanced financial sector. In the&#13;
aggregate, there is a clear reliance on financing through cash and intra-family financing, especially from&#13;
remittances. However, the opportunities for expatriate remittances has declined, signalling what will&#13;
probably be a shift towards greater reliance on formal credit for housing.&#13;
2.     Most lending for housing and other real estate is currently intermediated through the commercial&#13;
banking system.' There do not appear to be any accurate public data on the stock or the flow of loans for&#13;
housing, but it is possible to estimate formal sector lending for housing. At the end of 1994, the Housing&#13;
Bank (HB) held about JD90 million in loans lent out of its own funds to households for the purchase or&#13;
improvement of an owner-occupied home. This lending constituted only 17 percent of the HB's loan&#13;
portfolio. The Jordan Islamic Bank apparently has another JD60 million outstanding. Other banks have not&#13;
released figures on their long-term mortgage lending, but indicative estimates suggest that, in the aggregate,&#13;
the total would not exceed JD200 million for all of the banks (about 6 percent of bank credit), plus up to&#13;
JD200 million in directed credits made at concessional terms funded through other channels.2 This implies&#13;
a maximum of about JD400 million in housing loans, or almost 10 percent of GDP.&#13;
3.     Such small exposure to long-term housing lending presumably is due either to conscious risk&#13;
management on the part of the banks or a lack of interest on the part of households in using bank credit for&#13;
housing. Most banks express the view that both factors are at play, particularly since the net cost to a&#13;
mortgage borrower is currently about 13.5 percent for a loan for 7 years, in an economy with inflation under&#13;
5 percent since 1991. Moreover, the spread between the borrowing rate and the deposit rate is usually 5&#13;
percent or more, suggesting that greater equity investment in housing is preferable to accumulating wealth&#13;
in financial instruments.3&#13;
/ The great majority of bank lending for housing is done by the Housing Bank and the Jordan Islamic Bank. A&#13;
significant additional amount comes directly from government entities, in particular the military, which probably&#13;
has the largest portfolio of long-term housing loans outstanding. However, there are few public data on the&#13;
military housing scheme. Beyond the banks and the military, some lending appears to be undertaken directly by&#13;
private pension plans at a low rate for the benefit of plan participants and by the Social Security Corporation&#13;
(SSC) for the benefit of certain groups, such as university professors.&#13;
/ This includes about JD65 million held by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDC), perhaps&#13;
another JDI00 million outstanding in loans to military personnel, and JD25 million lent by the SSC.&#13;
3/ A minor caveat to this view is the fact that earnings on deposits are tax exempt to individuals, while the payment&#13;
of interest for housing is tax deductible. At the top income tax rate of 30 percent, the after-tax cost of borrowing&#13;
is only 9.45 percent, but the deduction is limited to JD2,000 per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
4.     For all banks, except the HB, there is the additional consideration that the HB has a number of&#13;
special privileges. These privileges appear to permit the HB to offer below-market terms on their housing&#13;
loans and give it a competitive ed,,e in mortgage origination that discourages active marketing by other&#13;
banks. For example, the HB offers limited amounts (only 5 percent of its portfolio) of deeply subsidized&#13;
loans (at a 7 percent interest rate) for 15 years to households with relatively moderate incomes (up to&#13;
JD4,500 per year) buying relatively (for Jordan) small houses (under 200 square meters) with small loans&#13;
(less than JD 10,000). The HB receives no external funding for these subsidies, but benefits from its low&#13;
statutory reserve and also from lower taxes. It appears that these two indirect subsidies alone would exceed&#13;
the loss on those loans. Moreover, the "unsubsidized" rate on loans at the HB appears to be less than at any&#13;
other bank. For example, the IB currently quotes an interest rate of 12 percent, while other banks are&#13;
quoting rates of 13.5 percent or higher. It is not possible to establish actual rate differentials, given the&#13;
widespread practice of offering discounts from quoted rates, but the RB does perceive its rate as below the&#13;
rest of the market. The HB charges the market rate on larger loans or loans used for commercial real estate&#13;
development.&#13;
5.     The HB also appears to be the only bank that extends mortgage loans to the general public for terms&#13;
of up to 15 years (it has extended loans up to 30 years when funded by special Government programs). It&#13;
does this only for the special low-rate loans for lower-income households, with instead a term of up to 12&#13;
years for loans to higher income households. No other bank will exceed 7 to 8 years for any loan. All of&#13;
these aspects of the HB are in flux, due to the efforts of the Government to develop a more level playing&#13;
field in the commercial banking sector (see below). The final outcome is still unclear, but there is a&#13;
possibility that the I-B would retain a tax-exemption on housing loans that would continue to not only fund&#13;
its current low-rate lending, but also encourage below-market rates on other forms of tax-exempt housing&#13;
lending.&#13;
6.     The Risks of Housing Finance. The credit risk associated with residential lending appears to be&#13;
reasonably low. The maximum loan is for 75 percent of the appraised value of the land and structure. The&#13;
appraisal is not based on the general prices in the market, but rather on an estimate of what the distress-sale&#13;
price might be. The legal basis for foreclosure on defaulted loans is relatively strong. Apparently because&#13;
of concern for appearances, foreclosure has been rarely begun (only after 18 months of delinquency) nor&#13;
pursued to its conclusion and most defaulted loans are rescheduled or otherwise compromised. Liquidity&#13;
risk is much more significant. Among banks other than the HB, there appears to be concern that external&#13;
political, economic, and demographic shocks could affect Jordan. Thus, many observers consider term mis-&#13;
matching as the most significant risk for lending for housing, thereby creating price and non-price&#13;
restrictions on access to housing credit. In contrast, due to its special treatment, the HB need not have the&#13;
same level of concern as other banks about risks to its survival and profitability. In this way, the&#13;
Government has solved some of the liquidity concerns about mortgage lending. However, it has given these&#13;
capabilities to a single bank, thereby precluding market-expanding fair competition.&#13;
7.    Interest rate risk is also associated with housing loans in Jordan. All loans have rates that are legally&#13;
subject to change if a bank's cost of funds goes up, but this flexibility has never been tested and could be&#13;
limited by both legal and political considerations. As it is, lender currently absorb small swings in the cost&#13;
of funds to avoid provoking controversy by changing rates. The net effect, however, is to create more&#13;
justification for banks to limit their exposure to housing loans.&#13;
8.     Leveling the Playing Field. The Government has articulated a medium-term strategy for reform of&#13;
the financial sector under the Economic Reform and Development Loan (ERDL) (Ln. 3947-JO), approved&#13;
on October 24, 1995. One of the key areas for action is with respect to the early removal of the special&#13;
privileges available to the HB. The specific privileges to be removed include the unconditional guarantee of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
HB liabilities, certain tax exemptions, certain fee exemptions, and certain advantages in foreclosure&#13;
situations. The HB would retain the tax exemption of income earned from housing loans (not just&#13;
"subsidized" loans) and its lower statutory reserve rate, but only for a "limited" period. As these reforms&#13;
take effect, the HB should find that it too has to be more concemed with liquidity risk, as well as face a&#13;
higher cost of raising deposits. In principle, the HB would lose its cost advantage in offering long-term&#13;
housing loans and has stated it might pull back to the same 7-8 year norm as other banks, as well as refrain&#13;
from offering below-market rates to moderate income households.&#13;
Developing the Financial Market&#13;
9.     Recent Bank sector and operational work indicates that Jordan is in need of improvements in its&#13;
financial market, especially with respect to medium- and longer-term  finance.4  The ERDL includes&#13;
provisions for strengthening competition in the banking sector and facilitating bond finance and an Export&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 3993-JO), approved on March 28, 1996, includes a refinance window using IBRD&#13;
funds. In addition, for at least ten years, there has been discussion in Jordan about the need for a method of&#13;
gathering long-term funds for use in housing loans, so that the terms of such loans could be extended.&#13;
Clearly, it makes the most sense to view the development of a solution to the term mis-match problem in&#13;
housing finance as part of the overall development of mechanisms for intermediating funds on a longer-tenn&#13;
b'.sis than typical bank finance. In fact, it has been found in the development of other financial markets that&#13;
market activity is very much self-reinforcing. If there is a fair degree of liquidity for security, more&#13;
investors and traders should be willing to participate in a market for securities based on housing loans,&#13;
further enhancing liquidity, and encouraging liquidity in similar securities.&#13;
10.   In most developing countries, govemment securities are already the most liquid form  of debt&#13;
instrument and thus the focus of efforts to increase the liquidity of a market. However, in Jordan, the level&#13;
of govemment debt to GDP is relatively low (external debt is five times the internal debt) and has not been&#13;
increasing. In addition, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has only slowly moved towards creating a climate&#13;
of market pricing of government debt. The result is that there is almost no real trading in debt securities of&#13;
any kind and no information about the market yield curve beyond one year (banks offer deposits out to one-&#13;
year, but do not actively seek them).&#13;
The Potential Benefits from Secondary Mortgage Funding&#13;
I.    Creation of a mechanism  for facilitating intermediation between truly longer-term  financial&#13;
investors and housing borrowers would permit the banks to reduce or eliminate the liquidity risks of housing&#13;
lending and also the interest rate risk by generating a source of fixed-rate funding. Moreover, if this&#13;
intermediation takes the form of homogeneous, nearly riskless securities issued on a large scale, the&#13;
securities can serve as the basis of expanding the range and capacities of the money market. Such&#13;
mechanisms are generally known as secondary mortgage funding sources. The term "secondary" is intended&#13;
to contrast with the "primary" market for mortgages, which consists of financial institutions which make the&#13;
loans initially. Under this broader understanding of secondary mortgage funding, there is a wide range of&#13;
altemative approaches being practiced around the world. The appropriateness of any system depends on the&#13;
circumstances prevailing in the housing and financial markets of the individual country.&#13;
12.    An institution that makes loans to primary lenders, using mortgages as collateral and funds raised&#13;
from its own bond issuances, is referred to as a secondary mortgage facility (SMF). The bonds of an SMF&#13;
can be safer and more liquid than those issued by a single lender because an SMF can independently control&#13;
/  Refer to main text of Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
the quantity of the collateral and can also achieve greater volumes of bond issuances. Several countries&#13;
have created such special institutions, usually with sponsorship by the Government. One way of viewing an&#13;
SMF is as a separate institution that pools together as collateral the very best mortgages from several banks&#13;
or other lending institutions and uses that collateral to offer bonds that are nearly risk-free to long-term&#13;
investors. The ownership of the mortgages stays with each lender, and the lender and the investors conclude&#13;
their long-term funding arrangement under the auspices and supervision of the SMF.&#13;
13.    The presence of a secondary market source of funding for mortgages can, in principle, reduce the&#13;
costs and liquidity risks that Jordanian banks face in funding housing loans. It could even permit the&#13;
operation of non-bank financial institutions specializing in housing finance (e.g., mortgage companies).&#13;
There will be an increase in the access of households to housing if the rates on mortgages are lower, the&#13;
terms are longer, or simply the banks market and originate housing credit more aggressively because they&#13;
feel more comfortable with their liquidity situation.&#13;
The SMF Proposed for Jordan&#13;
14.   It appears likely that a simple SMF, under which bonds are collateralized by loans to banks and the&#13;
loans are collateralized by mortgages, would be most suitable for Jordan. Figure 1.1 illustrates how the&#13;
SMF would operate within the current structure of the Jordanian financial system. Rather than have all of&#13;
the funds from the SSC, insurance companies and other long-term investors flow to the banks in the form of&#13;
deposits, some of the funds would flow to the SMF in return for bonds issued by the SMF. The SMF would&#13;
then make long-term loans to the banks in return for pledges of residential mortgages as collateral. The full&#13;
credit risks of the mortgage lending would stay with the banks, but the bank could now finance a part or all&#13;
of those loans with longer-term  funds.  This is a relatively simple arrangement.  The basic legal&#13;
requirements already exist in Jordan, including legal and institutional infrastructure for the issuance and&#13;
trading of long-term bonds and the pledging of mortgages as collateral. It is possible to establish the SMF&#13;
under existing laws for financial companies.&#13;
15.    The Jordanian SMF would be a financial institution, more like a specialized bank than an entity&#13;
such as the Amman Financial Market (AFM) or an ordinary operating company. It would make long-term&#13;
loans to banks; the funds in practice can be used by the bank for any purpose. However, the bank would&#13;
have to have originated enough qualifying loans for owner-occupied housing to serve as collateral for the&#13;
loans from the SMF. In practice, most banks would probably follow the approach of refinancing all or part&#13;
of their mortgage lending with the SMF, depending on their overall need for funds, the cost of alternative&#13;
sources of funds, and their desire to lengthen the overall term of their liabilities.&#13;
/  There are, however, a variety of provisions in the Companies Law that could hinder the proper functioning of the&#13;
SMF, and these have been addressed under the proposed project.&#13;

16.    The term of the loan from the SMF to the bank (the word "bank" refers here to any qualified lender,&#13;
not just commercial banks) would depend on the term of the bonds issued by the SMF to investors, and vice&#13;
versa. In the case of the Federal Home Loan Bank in the U.S.A. and the Malaysian SMF, the terms are&#13;
usually for 3 or 5 years at a fixed rate. In France, the term is usually 7 or 10 years. These loans would be&#13;
"oullet" loans, without repayment of any principal before maturity. Thus, even a 5 year loan could be very&#13;
6&#13;
useful in financing 7 to 10 year mortgages. The term of the interest rate need not be the same as the term of&#13;
the principal, i.e., the maturity of the bond or loan. At one extreme, the rate could be fixed for the full term&#13;
of the principal. At the other extreme, the interest rate could be floating, i.e., subject to change every 6&#13;
months or so, effectively as it is today for interest rates on the deposits currently used to fund mortgages.&#13;
The major difference from the current situation is that a formula has to be set at the time of issuance of the&#13;
bonds for how the interest rate would be reset. One simple approach, for example, would be to base the rate&#13;
on the current rate on government debt or on the average deposit rate. In this regard, a specific formula has&#13;
been formulated for the proposed project.&#13;
17.    Ownership of the SMF. The proposed SMF has the potential to be a tool for the Government and&#13;
the CBJ to develop the Jordanian financial market. Its debt would withstand close scrutiny as to credit risk,&#13;
without recourse to a government guarantee. It would offer investors an ideal intermediate terrn investment&#13;
and banks a safe channel to lend excess funds to other banks. With some assistance, the bonds could&#13;
6/ Cagamas Berhad, the Malaysian SMF, makes a practice of offering loans to banks that amortize at the same rate as&#13;
the mortgages backing up the loans. It still finances these loans through non-amortizing (i.e., bullet) bonds and&#13;
keeps an eye on the overall duration of its loans and bonds to keep them in balance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

become much more liquid than previous issues (see below). Lastly, the banks would have an ideal source of&#13;
funding for mortgage lending, permitting an expansion in competition in this market.7&#13;
18.    For these reasons, it is desirable for the CBJ to take an active role in the establishment of the SMF&#13;
and a partial ownership position, at least in the early years, to reassure investors as to the creditworthiness of&#13;
the SMF and to assure close cooperation between those in the CBJ responsible for internal debt markets and&#13;
the SMF. However, the sums of money involved in the SMF could grow quite large and its policy decisions&#13;
could benefit one kind of lender or investor relative to others. Moreover, there is a significant potential for&#13;
the GOJ to desire to use the SMF as a conduit for subsidy. For all these reasons, it is desirable for there to&#13;
be a majority ownership participation dispersed over all the private participants in the system; i.e., the banks&#13;
and the investors.&#13;
19.    Initial capitalization of the SMF has been set at JD5 million. This amount should support lending to&#13;
banks of up to JD300 million (at a 20 percent capital risk weight for its loans to banks), far more than is&#13;
expected to be outstanding after the first 5 years of operation. On the other hand, the amount is less than the&#13;
capital of many minor industrial companies and of the JD20 million now required of banks. It may seem to&#13;
suggest a weak, poorly capitalized entity. But any higher amount would significantly dilute the return on&#13;
equity and thus the commercial success of the SMF.&#13;
20.    To solve this problem, the Government's on-lending of proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to the&#13;
SMF would be subordinated to other debt issuances of the SMF. This should effectively increase the capital&#13;
of the SMF from JD5 million to almost JD20 million without diluting the return to shareholders. This&#13;
subordinated debt would amortize along with the IBRD loan after an initial grace period.&#13;
21.    Perceptions of a Government Guarantee. There has not been a successful issuance of long-term&#13;
bonds in Jordan that was not explicitly guaranteed by the Government. However, many secondary funding&#13;
mechanisms operate without explicit government guarantees, with investors recognizing that the collateral&#13;
backing their loans is the best available in the economy, short of the power of money creation that resides&#13;
only with the government. This is the case of all but one of the four SMFs in the United States and for the&#13;
Malaysian and French SMFs. Thus, there are grounds for confidence that the SMF would be able to operate&#13;
without a government guarantee.&#13;
22.    There would be two major benefits of avoiding such a guarantee.  First, the Government is&#13;
attempting to limit its financial burdens in order to improve macroeconomic conditions. Experience in other&#13;
countries in other situations indicates that guarantees can gradually erode incentives for cautious behavior&#13;
on the part of management and create risk where there was not risk before. Second, Jordan's financial&#13;
markets would benefit from the precedent of investors examining the real creditworthiness of an enterprise,&#13;
rather than simply relying on a blanket guarantee. But it is not clear whether such an exercise would be&#13;
successful currently; it simply may not be possible for bond issuers to expect such an assessment until credit&#13;
ratings of private entities become available in Jordan.8&#13;
/  The saying in the banking business in Jordan is that they wait for the deposit to come in the door amd then they&#13;
look to make a (very short term) loan. The interbank loan market has not worked well, so banks have to both&#13;
retain excess liquidity and remain cautious lenders.&#13;
8 /  For example, in the U.S.A., investors do not routinely examine creditworthiness, relying instead on simple rating&#13;
designations by professional credit rating agencies to assess the credit risks involved. In Europe, there is a&#13;
tradition of judging risks without formal credit ratings, but the general debt market is also profoundly different,&#13;
since banks provide most corporate finance and build up intimate knowledge of the financial conditions of their&#13;
corporate clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
23.    The proposed ownership, management, and capitalization structure of the SMF is considered to be&#13;
the best possible compromise arrangement for Jordan. The minority stake of the Government indicates the&#13;
government's endorsement of the SMF. Secondly, the control of management by the CBJ should assure&#13;
investors that the risk level of the institution would be kept low. Finally, the initial capitalization of the&#13;
SMF would be effectively expanded by purchases of long-term subordinated debt by the Government using&#13;
disbursements from the proposed Bank loan for the project. The combined amounts of Tier I and Tier 11&#13;
capital would provide a very large buffer against default over the first five or more years of operation of the&#13;
SMF. Gradually, the capital ratio should decline as loans outstanding grow, and as all parties acquire&#13;
greater understanding of the nature of the SMF's risk exposure.&#13;
24.    Taxation and Regulation. As is often the case in financial markets, taxation and regulation are key&#13;
determinants as to what intermediation structures are attractive and which are not. Secondary market&#13;
arrangements are such hybrids that they often require special determinations as to their taxation and&#13;
regulation. These institutions tend to play a larger role in the overall market when they receive relatively&#13;
favorable treatment, one that reflects the public benefits from their successful operation. The taxation&#13;
treatment is to be relatively straightforward. The net income of the SMF would be taxed according to the&#13;
same treatment accorded to regular banks (35 percent of net profit). In addition, the bonds issued by the&#13;
SMF would receive the same tax treatment as bank deposits; i.e., exemption on interest to individuals.&#13;
25.    The proper position of banking regulators with respect to the SMF and its activities are more&#13;
difficult to establish. For example, the riskiness of its loans to the banks is greater than loans to the&#13;
government, but less than the risks of unsecured interbank lending.9 There is some basis for granting a 10&#13;
percent risk weight to the SMF on its loans to the banks (instead of the normal 20 percent for interbank&#13;
loans), but that is not being sought. The bonds of the SMF have even a lower degree of risk because they&#13;
are further backed by the capital of the SMF. This suggests that the risk weight for holdings of such bonds&#13;
by banks could be as low as 10 percent, as it is in Malaysia and the U.S.A.&#13;
26.    The CBJ has recently decided that interbank loans are exempt from  the statutory reserve&#13;
requirement of 14 percent (in cash held at the CBJ) and the current liquidity reserves of 16 percent (invested&#13;
in CBJ debt). Since the loans from the SMF to the banks would be treated as interbank loans, these&#13;
exemptions would apply to the SMF. However, there is the question of the reserves required to be kept by&#13;
the SMF on funds it raises through bond issuances. The CBJ has determined that there is no need for the&#13;
cash statutory reserve in this case. A similar determination has been made with respect to the overall&#13;
liquidity reserve of 30 percent, since there is no uncertainty about calls on the borrowed funds and the term&#13;
is relatively long.&#13;
27.    These determinations would mean that the banks should find the SMF intermediation process&#13;
attractive. This is consistent with the point of view of regulators seeking to encourage the management of&#13;
liquidity and interest rate risks, and thus providing advantages to this form of liability. The other area of&#13;
potential improvement in the overall financial market that would be facilitated by the SMF is in the trading&#13;
of medium-term debt instruments. The likelihood of such trading is greatly increased if short-term investors&#13;
such as banks are encouraged to buy and trade SMF bonds (see below). In Malaysia, this encouragement&#13;
has been applied in the form of excluding the amount of SMF bonds held from the base against which the&#13;
/ In fact, the weight for residential loans of the type backing the SMF loans is 50 percent. When applied to the&#13;
weight for unsecured interbank loans of 20 percent, the implication is that a weight of 10 percent would be&#13;
acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
liquidity reserve is applied. The CBJ would grant SMF bonds in Jordan this same advantage, at least&#13;
temporarily. 10&#13;
28.    Trading in SMF Bonds. Housing is not the only long-tern investment in a society. Factories,&#13;
hotels, and other long-lived assets would also benefit from long-term financing. Investor.- and borrowers&#13;
would also benefit from market infornation about the preferences for other borrowers and investors with&#13;
respect to the term of their financing; e.g., what premium is required to get investors to commit to a longer-&#13;
term interest rate or funding commitment. Addressing these issues requires the development of an active&#13;
market in long-termn debt. So far, efforts to do so in Jordan have not been successful. If the SMF succeeds&#13;
in attracting business, it would make issuances of bonds much more substantial and frequent than in recent&#13;
experience. At the time of each issuance, the pricing and marketing of the bonds should yield useful&#13;
information about the terms under which long-term capital can be raised. The next step would be to attempt&#13;
to encourage trading in the bonds. There are two benefits from frequent trading. One is the same as the&#13;
benefit from frequent issuances; i.e., better informnation as to market conditions. The second is that, if the&#13;
bonds are reasonably liquid, investors such as individuals and banks, who may have a shorter horizon than a&#13;
pension fund, may be comfortable holding the bonds and selling them as and when they wish.&#13;
29.    The simplest way of enticing more large investors into holding SMF bonds is to pernit banks to&#13;
count them against their liquidity ratio (or exempt an equal amount of deposits from the liquidity ratio).&#13;
Once ownership of the bonds becomes part of the calculation of their liquidity ratios, banks would have an&#13;
incentive to not only own the bonds, but also to trade them as their liquidity situation changes or in&#13;
anticipation of changes in interest rates. This has been the experience of Malaysia with respect to Cagamas&#13;
bonds and merits granting the SMF bonds this special treatment.&#13;
30.    The Ottoman Law and Mortgage Term.  It is commonly noted that housing finance in Jordan&#13;
has to work around a remaining provision of the Ottoman law that could possibly constrain the total&#13;
cumulative interest on a loan from exceeding the principal. Generally, it is a potential issue only if the tern&#13;
of the loan is longer than 10 years, something which lenders do not want to offer because of liquidity&#13;
concerns. However, since the SMF would allow lenders to manage their liquidity risk, the Ottoman Law&#13;
could possibly constrain them from extending the terrn of mortgages beyond 10 years. The CBJ is therefore&#13;
considering the issuance of an appropriate legal clarification that the CBJ Law (viz., Section 43 (E)) would&#13;
override the Ottoman Law in this respect.&#13;
/ There are relevant policy issues raised by these steps with respect to favoring the provision of credit to the housing&#13;
sector. The exemption of SMF fund raising through bond issuance from the reserve requirements is arguably&#13;
appropriate, given the differences of such fund raising for the risk and liquidity structure of the financial sector.&#13;
The application of SMF bonds towards meeting liquidity requirements, however, extends to SMF debt an&#13;
advantage that would not generally be available to other private debt issuances (if and when they appear). This&#13;
does extend to the housing market, at least that portion of it eligible for SMF refinance, a distortion in the cost of&#13;
credit that must be assessed against external benefits from a reduced cost of housing credit and the encouragement&#13;
of trading in a debt security that is far more likely to be tradeable than single issues of general corporate debt.&#13;

Dear M.r.Wolfcnsohn,&#13;
The Govermment of Jordan is undertaking a far-reaching effort to bring the&#13;
energy. creativity, and fiancing of the private seclor to bear on the development of&#13;
the economy.  An efficient macroeconomic fiamework is being maintained. The&#13;
role of the pdvate sector is being expanded through many mcans, including through&#13;
policy and regulatory refozms that wll help to crcate a level and cfficient playing&#13;
field, through invitations to the private sector to participarc in areas of the ecoaomy&#13;
such as infrastcture Ehat have traditionally bec= managed solely by the public&#13;
sector, through the corporatiztioa and privati=ton of public sector institutions, and&#13;
through the sale of government shares in public shareholding companies. In the&#13;
financial sector, measures are being implemented to improve banking competition in&#13;
the pLirniay market, incrcase market efficiency, and foster the development of long-&#13;
term  fiiancing instruncnts. Interest rates have already been liberalized and inflatioz&#13;
is being hcld to kcss than S percent per annum. Investnent and taxation laws are&#13;
bcing changed to cncourage private sector participation, while monopolie, customs&#13;
tariffs, and oLher barriers to private sector market entry, competition and exports are&#13;
bcing dismantled or reduced.&#13;
In the housing scctor, Jordan for many years has pursued policies and&#13;
strategies emphasizing public sector responsibility for meeting basic needs for&#13;
housing aad housing finance. In the production sector, a government housing&#13;
agcncy was esLablished to develop and service land and bousing. Its sustainability&#13;
depended on prefcrcntial tax, fcc and legal trcatments, and priority access to&#13;
govcrmxnent land, propeity  rights and subsidized financing.  Similarly, in the&#13;
financial sector, a goverrincat-sporisored1lousing Bank was established to help&#13;

government subsidies and special privileges so as to bc ablc to shoulder certain&#13;

In  the production sector, following the  emergence of private sector&#13;
developers. the continuation of this approach would discourage private scstor&#13;
participation in developing land aad housing especially for lower income&#13;
households. It could also lead to misallocations of resources in the Govein7rints&#13;
ovrall development efrorts, since it would impose market risls on the Government&#13;
that the private sector should bear, and Icad to distortions in the use of land and&#13;
inifrastcture.  In the financial sector, the Govemnmt's eforfm  in the past to&#13;
provide below-market mortgage financing to lower income households through the&#13;
Housing Bank has limited conppeition in housing finance.&#13;
It is clear that, because of the fast growth and devalopment of the eocknomy in&#13;
recent yeas and the emercnce of I more vibrant financial market, thcre is a need&#13;
for new approachcs to prmote affordable housing ad housing finance, includi-ng&#13;
measures to deepcn the financial system, promote die private sector, and rmduce the&#13;
role of the public sector. Consistent with Jordan's emphasis in recenT years on&#13;
devcloping private sector solutions to economic problems, tle Govrnnnt intends&#13;
to implement measures to mobilize increased mortgage financing by thc banking&#13;
sector, and also to shift responsibility to the private secor for developiug land&#13;
and housing for loweq income houscholds. Ovcr time, public sector activitets will be&#13;

EXPANDING THE HOUSJNG FINANCE MARKET&#13;
Jordan has a siong system of private commercial banks, as well as the&#13;
Housing Bank. The Housing Bank has maintained a dual-presence in the market,&#13;
competing in ordinary banking fields but also bearing special responsibilities&#13;
towards certain sectors of the economy, including providing convenient branches&#13;
and low-cost, long-term housing loans, with the backing of a v.-riety of special&#13;
privilegcs designed to be supportive in these endeavors. Ta promot general&#13;
competition in commercial banking aad particularly to encourage geater&#13;
competition in housing finance, the Governmmet has decided to remove the special&#13;
responsibilities and pLivileges of the Housing Bank. The proccss of removing these&#13;
privileges is already underway as part of a larger effort to encourage competition in&#13;
the general banking sector. The necessary amendments to the Housing Hank Law&#13;
and also the Companies Law are envisaged under the Economic Reform and&#13;
Development Loan (ERDL).&#13;
In the financial sector, the amounts and terms of market-basedmortgage&#13;
financing have bcc limited gcnerally to lower rsk motgages for higher income&#13;
households. Tic banking sector currendy relies on deposits (mainly short-term) for&#13;
funding; the absence of term liquidity weakens the attractiveness to the banking&#13;
sector of term lending. The primary and secondary markets in bonds and othcr term&#13;
securities are emerging but stiU underdeveloped, liuiting prudent opportunitiCs for&#13;
thc.banking sector to raise term finance to fund term lending.&#13;
It is clcar that more efficient fluncial mgrket mechanisms must be instituted&#13;
both to mobili7.c griater financial flows for mortgage lending and also to help&#13;
improve the terms of mortgages gcnerally available in the banking sector. This, in&#13;
tum. will improve the affordability of housing. In addition, it is dcsirable tu develop&#13;
the medium-term debt market, particularly with respect to the liquidity of debt&#13;
instrtzments.&#13;
'Ihi Goverxmcnt has thercfore decided to cstablish a Secondary Mortgage&#13;
Facility (SMWk) in 1996. The SMF will be established under the Companies Law and&#13;
regulated by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) as a financial institution. The&#13;

the first four years of SMF operations); and (c) build investor confidence in Jordan's&#13;
emerging bond maricet by offeing bonds of transparenly low risk. The SMF would&#13;
make housing lending more attractive, by permitting lenders to reduce significantly&#13;
the liquidity risks of medium and long-term mortgage lending.&#13;
The Governmntt will only bc a minority shareholder to ensure that the SMF&#13;
is primarily responsive to the needs of iLvestors and lenders. This approach will&#13;
mean that there will be no direct link between SMF operations and lending for low-&#13;
cost housing. However, the Government is confident that the expansion of housing&#13;
finance in ways that deepen the capital market in general and that build the&#13;
attractiveness of housing ledin&amp;g, will provide substantial benefits to all Jordanian&#13;
households.&#13;
The SMF will have strong ownership participation by all key participants in&#13;
the financial system (e.g.. Government, CB], baaks,. and bond in.vest3rs), but&#13;
majority owncrsbip will be held by private sector-owned banks and investors.&#13;
However, no single bank (other than CBJ) or private sector partcipanr. wiU be&#13;
permitted to ovwn more than 10 percent of the SMF. Its charter will bc narrow to&#13;
shield it from substantial risk. It will have two main flinctons. First, it will mak&#13;
medium and long-term loans to the banidng sector on dte stength of pledged&#13;
collater;i consisting solely of mortgages on residential housing, and will nut accept&#13;
any risks associated with the original mortgagc loans (e.g., credit risk, interest rate&#13;
risk, pre-paymcnt risk). Second, die SMF will raise fands for lending to the banks&#13;
by offering bonds to investors. The proceeds of the proposed World Bank loan will&#13;
be on-lcnt to the SM? and wilj be subordinated to all other SMF borrowings, thereby&#13;
enhancing confidence in SMF bond issuances. IT order to be successful, the SMF&#13;
will rely on large scale issuance of bonds.&#13;
SMF loans to finaacial institutions will bc treated as interbank lending for&#13;
regulatory purposes. Hlowever. since SMF loanm wil be longer-tam thmn deposits&#13;
and have set ren.s, flands raised by banks through SNAP loans will be exempt from&#13;

pnvate sector has been operating mainly in the market for upper midcde and high&#13;
income housing. The formal housing market for lower income households has been&#13;
served mainly by government-sponsored housing ageacies. Small owner-builders&#13;
and other informal developer, have also operated in the lower income housing&#13;
market--&#13;
Tne public sector housing agencies were merged in 1992 to form the EIousing&#13;

development, sale and mortgagc financing of land and housing targctod to lower&#13;
income households, and also formulation of housing policy. Rcccn'dy, the&#13;
Govemrnent has confined HUDC's commcrciaUy-oriented activities only to land&#13;

HIUDC and its prcdecessors were responsible for the successffil completion of&#13;
many projects helpful to thousands of lower-income 3ordanians. However,&#13;

involve certain inefficiencies and also tends to undermine dhe market potcntial for&#13;
privatc sector development Thus, an importaat goal of the Govenment is to bring&#13;
the benefits of increased private sector participation into the market, especially for&#13;
lower income housing. A second goal is co reducche role of the public sector in&#13;
commercially-oriented production of land to allow the private sector to take on a&#13;
much greater share of the business and market risks associated with land and&#13;
housing development&#13;
Beginning in 1994. the Government decided to explore how to reduce the role&#13;
of the HUDC in land producdion and, simultaneously, to reorient its resources and&#13;
functions to encourage the private sector to be more active in the portion of the&#13;
market that bas been sewred by HUDC. Accordingly, a number of studies and other&#13;
preparation activities were canied out by HUDC.&#13;
Aftcr reviewing the finings and recommendatons of these actrv;ies, the&#13;
Cabinet has approved and announced a package of institutional and regulatory&#13;
reform measures to support the emergencc of an cfficicnt privatc sector real cstate&#13;
industry responsive to the needs of low and moderate income householdsL The&#13;
approved measures will: (a) reduce the regulatory barriers that constrain the pnivate&#13;
sector from enteing and competing iz the lower income market, and from&#13;
responding efriciently and effectively to market signals and needs; and (b) laumch&#13;
a new Public-Prtvare Partnership Procesi to atmact greater private sector&#13;
participation in land and housing development  AU developers will benclit from&#13;
improvecT zoning and development rcgulation, capable of making private&#13;
development significandy more affordable.&#13;
The principal regulatory reform mcaswres, which have been announced by the&#13;
Goverrnment for irmediatc implemcnatrion. include:&#13;
GTanting fUl rights to the private sector to adopt and use tlc more&#13;
affordable plot sizes and building standards devcloped and used by&#13;
HUDC; all developcrs will benefit from improved zoning and&#13;
development regulation. which should be capable of making private sector&#13;
dcvelopmeat sigtificantly more affordable.&#13;

in HTJDC's role and mandate from that of publtc sectorproducer of.serviced land to&#13;
that of policy formulator, facilitator andpromoter ofprtvate sector development of&#13;
land and houasingfor low and modrate income households. Beginning in 1996. the&#13;
performance of thc institutional reform measures will be judged nainly on how well&#13;
EUDC attracts and facilitates private sector developmentofland ad housing for&#13;
low and moderate income households. HUDC's land development activitics will be&#13;
expected to decline over time; it will not purchase any additional land for&#13;
development purposes exceeding SO hectares cxcept as approved by the Minister of&#13;
Public Works and Housing.&#13;
To carry out its new role, HUJDC will adopt a number of alr.rnative&#13;
approaches.  One approach will be to acdon otfto the private sector the rights to&#13;
develop HUDC-owned land in accordance with specified dcvclopment criteria, such&#13;
as the mix of plot sizes and pTice ceilings for housing units. Another approach will&#13;
be to solicit partnerships with private developers of private land, whereby HUDC&#13;
offers ies-expertise to facilitate design. implemeatadion and approval processes.&#13;
The performance of the reform program will be assessed in accordance with&#13;
targets for HUlDC-facilitated land and housing development schemes carried out by&#13;
whoUy private sector-owned developers. The targets for IUDC-sponsored private&#13;
sector schemes will increase annually over the next five years. Concertec efforts&#13;
vill be made to achieve the trgets, if aecessary by reallocating, through auction or&#13;
other transparent method, the development rights an HUDC sites to prisvate sector&#13;

Eligibility Criteria for Use of the Secondary Mortgage Facility&#13;
Criteria for Financial Institutions to Borrow from the SMF&#13;
I1.    A financial institution would be eligible to enter into a Participation Agreement with the SMF&#13;
provided it:&#13;
(a)   is privately owned;&#13;
(b)   is in compliance with all applicable banking or financial company laws, capital adequacy&#13;
requirements, and monetary regulations of the CBJ;&#13;
(c)   is current in the auditing of its financial statements by independent auditors, and has an&#13;
audit report that is unqualified;&#13;
(d)    has a sound financial structure and satisfactory financial perfornance, and the&#13;
organization, management, staff and other resources required for efficient operations;&#13;
(e)    has adequate technical and administrative capacity and qualified staff, and financial and&#13;
operating policies satisfactory to the SMF and the Bank, for appraising and monitoring a&#13;
mortgage loan portfolio and for carrying out other mortgage lending activities;&#13;
(f)   supervises and monitors the mortgage loans in accordance with procedures satisfactory&#13;
to the SMF, the CBJ and the Bank;&#13;
(g)    adheres to the criteria and principal terms and conditions required by the SMF for&#13;
extending mortgage loans that would be pledged as collateral, including those given in&#13;
paragraphs 2 and 3 below;&#13;
(h)   exchanges views with, and furnishes all such information and documentation as may&#13;
reasonably be requested by the SMF and CBJ, in regard to the mortgage loans pledged as&#13;
collateral, the performance of its obligations under its Participation Agreement, and its&#13;
audited accounts; and&#13;
(i)   in the case of a new financial institution, has demonstrated, on the basis of an&#13;
institutional development plan satisfactory to the SMF and the Bank, that it has the&#13;
organization, management, staff and other resources required for appraising and&#13;
monitoring a mortgage loan portfolio and for carrying out other mortgage lending&#13;
activities.&#13;

Criteria for Pledging of Loans&#13;
2.    Each mortgage loan pledged to the SMF as collateral would satisfy the following criteria:&#13;
(a)    The mortgaged property would be for owner-occupied or rental residential use primarily;&#13;
(b)    The remaining term of the mortgage loan would be 140 percent or more of the term of&#13;
the loan being extended by the SMF;&#13;
(c)    The maximum allowable level of arrears on the mortgage loan would be 3 months; and&#13;
(d)    The ratio of the mortgage loan to the appraised value of the property does not exceed 80&#13;
percent.&#13;
3.    As any of the mortgage loans pledged as collateral are redeemed, fall into arrears of more than 3&#13;
months, or have normal or early payments of principal made, the PFI would be required to pledge&#13;
additional mortgage loans or other assets approved by the SMF, in order to maintain at the end of each&#13;
calendar quarter, and aggregate principal value of collateral of 120 percent of the SMF's loans to the PFI.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Financial Analysis and Projections of Secondary Mortgage Facility Operations&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The design of the SMF's institutional and operational modalities has been tailored to the particular&#13;
circumstances in Jordan and would likely need further development as experience is gained from operations.&#13;
But this would not assure its success. Success would depend primarily on whether lenders perceive the cost&#13;
and features of funds obtained through the SMF to be attractive relative to funds raised by deposit-taking.&#13;
Expectations of Bond Investors&#13;
2.     For investors, the expected benefits from investing in SMF bonds would comprise low credit risk, a&#13;
reliable return over the medium term, and potentially a reasonable degree of liquidity. These features can be&#13;
contrasted with the alternatives of bank deposits and government-guaranteed bonds. As of October 1995,&#13;
banks were taking large deposits for periods of 6 months to a year at rates between 8.5 percent to 9.0&#13;
percent, tax-free. These deposits were not immediately liquid, included some degree of credit risk, and the&#13;
rates were subject to change at maturity. Government 1 0-year bonds were sold at 9.25 percent and were not&#13;
expected to be traded. (There was some basis for expecting the implicit yield curve to be fairly flat, because&#13;
deposit rates in the medium tern could decline if inflation stayed low and U.S. rates declined). However,&#13;
government bonds have the advantage of eligibility for the required liquidity reserve of banks. Since this&#13;
provision would also be extended to SMF bonds, banks should be interested in holding and possibly trading&#13;
them at rates only a little above the rates on government bonds (if fixed) or on CBJ Certificates of Deposit&#13;
(CDs) (if floating). If the SMF bonds did not offer this feature, the banks would not be interested in holding&#13;
them at rates much less than the all-in cost of funding, around 11 percent.&#13;
3.     The above analysis suggests that the banks and long-term investors such as the Social Security&#13;
Corporation (SSC), insurance companies, and some individuals should be willing to hold the SMF bonds at&#13;
rates as low as 25-50 basis points over the rate on government bonds. However, the rate would have to be&#13;
higher if the bonds were not eligible for the liquidity reserve. If the banks are not holders, liquidity would&#13;
also be diminished, further increasing the required rate. If the market in SMF bonds develops a reasonable&#13;
degree of liquidity and low transactions costs, the rate could be lower.&#13;
Expectations of Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)&#13;
4.     For PFIs, SMF funding should reduce the interest rate risk of mortgage lending, assuming the bonds&#13;
and the funds are offered with a matching degree of variability in interest rate that appeals to investors,&#13;
banks, and borrowers and, since SMF funds are for a longer term, also reduce the liquidity risk of mortgage&#13;
lending. PFI's should therefore be willing to pay more for SMF funds than the highest stated rate on&#13;
incremental deposits including the cost of raising and holding the incremental deposits, since SMF funds&#13;
would substitute for deposits. This premium could be 50 basis points or more. The breakeven lending rate&#13;
for an additional JD of deposit raised at 9.0 percent is at least 11.0 percent cu..ently (with 14 percent set&#13;
aside in cash and another 16 percent in CBJ CDs at 8.5 percent). These considerations imply that if the&#13;
highest stated rate on one-year deposits is 9.0 percent (and is expected to remain so for the next 5 years),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
then PFIs would be willing to pay about .11.5 percent or more for SMF funding, assuming that the loan from&#13;
the SMF is exempt from the statutory and liquidity reserve requirements. If the loan is at a fixed rate, and&#13;
the PFI's housing loans are also, the PFI should be willing to pay even more if it expects interest rates to&#13;
continue to rise in the medium term.&#13;
Commercial Viability of the SMF&#13;
5.    In arriving at a sustainable lending rate. the SMF would have to add a margin to cover the costs of&#13;
bond issuance, of administration, and of capital. In this regard, a major determinant of the viability of the&#13;
SMF would be the total volume of SMF lending. The administrative expenses of the SMF would be&#13;
relatively fixed, and thus the spread it will require for its operations would depend on the volume of its&#13;
business. Of course, the volume of its business would depend on the spread, so this issue would only be&#13;
settled once all the other considerations become clearer. Table 4.1 summarizes the assumptions, discussed&#13;
below, that form the basis for the financial projections given in Table 4.2.&#13;
6.    It appears that currently the amount of qualifying loans (i.e., for residential purposes, at market rate,&#13;
for more than 5 years, and less than JD50,000) made annually by all banks is less than JD40 million.&#13;
However, this volume should increase significantly if more banks are willing to lend and for longer terms.&#13;
In addition, there is at least another JD50 million outstanding of such loans which could be refinanced in the&#13;
near term. Thus, the projections in this annex indicate a potential for the SMF to accumulate a net portfolio&#13;
of around JD100 million in the space of 4 years, if the pricing of its funds is attractive enough.&#13;
7.     A major operating cost is that of issuing and servicing SMF bonds. Interviews with investment&#13;
bankers indicate that the current cost of issuing JD5 million of 5-year bonds would be about 2.0 percent.&#13;
However, the SMF would be a frequent issuer of bonds with a small number of major purchasers. On a&#13;
portfolio of JDI00 million, this could bring underwriting costs down to 1.5 percent or less, or the equivalent&#13;
of about 0.3 percent per year or 30 basis points for 5-year bonds. In addition, however, there would be a&#13;
relatively small on-going cost for servicing the bonds.&#13;
8.     The administrative costs of the SMF would be similar. Based on the experience of Cagamas&#13;
(Malaysian SMF) in administering a very similar program, a staff of only 14-16 would be needed to operate&#13;
the program initially. In addition, there would be the cost of offices, equipment, outside auditors, and so on.&#13;
A preliminary estimate, based on the expense profile of the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation, is that such&#13;
administrative costs would amount to about JD350,000, or about 0.35 percent per year or 35 basis points on&#13;
a portfolio of JDIOO million.&#13;
9.     Finally, there is the cost of capital. The capital needs of the SMF should be relatively small and the&#13;
risks involved less than those in most equity investments. Thus, private shareholders may expect a premium&#13;
of only 6-7 percent, after tax,s, over the (tax-free) deposit rate (8-9 percent), or an overall rate of return on&#13;
equity of about 15 percent. On capital of JD5 million and a portfolio of JD]OO million, such a return would&#13;
require an additional before-tax spread of about 70 basis points.  Thus, the SMF's total gross spread&#13;
requirement would be about 135 basis points. This implies that the cost of SMF funds to the PFIs should be&#13;
no more than the all-in costs of deposits. Assuming that the rate on SMF bonds is about 9.75 percent, the&#13;
SMF would need to charge about II percent on its loans to PFIs, which is roughly at the lower end of the&#13;
range that banks are estimated to be willing to pay.&#13;
10.   In summary, the SMF should be commercially viable, even without taking into account potential&#13;
benefits to PFIs from improved asset-liability management or to borrowers from longer lending terms. If&#13;
these benefits are significant, the SMF should thrive. Nevertheless, the estimates for the SMF are based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
a number of assumptions with ranges of reasonable error that impose on the SMF a significant risk that it&#13;
could be left with a customer base too small for it to be commercially viable.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan and Performance Indicators&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
1.    An Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Public Works&#13;
and Housing and comprising the Ministers of Planning; Finance; Industry and Trade; Municipalities, Rural&#13;
Affairs and the Environment; Agriculture; Administrative Development; the Governor of the Central Bank&#13;
of Jordan (CBJ); and the Director General of HUDC, would oversee implementation of the reform program&#13;
and the Housing Finance and Urban Sector Reform Project. HUDC would be responsible for implementing&#13;
the institutional and regulatory reform component of the Project. The Board of Directors and management&#13;
of the Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF) would be responsible for implementing the SMF component, but&#13;
CBJ would monitor this component during the project period. Both HUDC and CBJ have established&#13;
Project Implementation Units (PIUs) for their respective project components. The two PlUs would monitor&#13;
compliance with Bank guidelines, procurement, schedules, loan covenants, performance indicators,&#13;
expected costs at completion, and project accounts (including commitments and disbursements), report on&#13;
project implementation progress, keep track of historical changes, and participate in Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
2.    During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, by September 30, 1996, HUDC would establish&#13;
and staff a dedicated organizational unit to perform its new facilitator role and to manage the&#13;
implementation of the institutional and regulatory reform measures. This unit would be headed by an&#13;
experienced manager with advanced training in economics and his or her staff would include a competent&#13;
urban planner and a competent statistician.&#13;
3.    A comprehensive Mid-Term Review involving the Government and the Bank would be carried out&#13;
no later than December 31, 1998, to: (a) review progress to date; (b) assess performance against monitorable&#13;
indicators; (c) assess the sustainability of the SMF and the effectiveness of HUDC's new role and mandate;&#13;
(d) assess the willingness of private sector developers and banks to construct and finance lower income&#13;
housing; and (e) assess also the willingness of municipalities to rezone land to allow smaller plot sizes for&#13;
private sector land developers. If necessary, adjustments to project components and procedures would be&#13;
made to improve project implementation.&#13;
4.    Performance of the project in meeting its objectives would be measured against selected key&#13;
development impact indicators for each of the two project components. Implementation progress would be&#13;
monitored using key performance monitoring indicators (Table 5.2).&#13;
Development Impact Indicators for the SMF&#13;
5.    Three distinct benefits are expected from the SMF: (a) a decrease in the liquidity risk of the&#13;
mortgage portion of bank portfolios, due to an increase in its liquidity; (b) an increase in the ability to&#13;
borrow for housing, due to a lengthening of the term to maturity in the market-rate loans being offered by&#13;
lenders; and (c) a decrease in the cost of intermediation for corporate bonds, due to an increase in the&#13;
liquidity of all corporate bonds. Of these benefits, only the second, the increase in borrowing ability, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
directly measurable. However, all of the benefits have correlates that are measurable and can be tracked as&#13;
indicators of the success of the SMF. The SMF project component impacts can be measured most carefully&#13;
by regularly surveying lenders as to the their cost of funds, their rates and other terms for mortgage lending,&#13;
the amounts of such lending and perhaps also their narrative perspectives on such lending. Such a survey&#13;
would be designed under the auspices of the project and conducted by the SMF.&#13;
6.     Decrease in Liquidity Risk, As discussed in Annexes 4 and 8 on the financial and economic&#13;
analyses of the SMF, respectively, the banks currently seem to be seeking in their mortgage lending a gross&#13;
spread of about 250 basis points over their all-in marginal cost of deposits. A portion of this should be&#13;
related to the illiquidity being introduced into their portfolio by lending long-term for housing. That portion&#13;
should be reducible to near zero, if the SMF offers lenders a viable option for refinancing their loan&#13;
portfolio. Such a reduction in the liquidity risk associated with housing loans should be noticeable in two&#13;
respects. The gross operating spread of lenders in a competitive market should decline over time. A&#13;
reduction of up to 50 basis points may be achieved within about five years. Also, lenders should be willing&#13;
to lend for longer terms than the 7 years currently observed (see below). Thus, both of these parameters of&#13;
market behavior would be used as indicators of development impact.&#13;
7.     Observing changes in market spread would not be straightforward. Efforts would need to be made&#13;
to systematically track the average effective rate on mortgage lending, accounting for the offering of&#13;
discounts to some borrowers and the imposition of various fees that raise the effective rate. Some work&#13;
would also need to be done on how banks view their all-in marginal cost of funds, as a function of their rate&#13;
for large deposits and the costs of reserve requirements.&#13;
8.    Indirect measures of development impact in this regard would also be monitored, including the&#13;
volume of SMF refinancing activity, the share of outstanding mortgage loans which it refinances, and its&#13;
achievement of commercial sustainability. The financial projections given in Table 4.2, Annex 4, suggest&#13;
that the SMF's outstanding portfolio of mortgage refinancings could possibly grow to about JDl00 million&#13;
after about five years, or an estimated 40 percent of the projected total volume of mortgage loans in Jordan.&#13;
Other indirect measures of development impact include the self reports of lenders and the appearance of&#13;
lengthening in the term to maturity for housing loans. The term extension is particularly important because&#13;
it is the major channel whereby the impacts on the intermediation process create benefits for individual&#13;
households. But direct measurement of a narrowing of the intermediation spread would be needed to assess&#13;
whether the SMF has reduced liquidity risks on the outstanding portfolio of housing loans, as it is expected&#13;
to.&#13;
9.     Longer Lending Terms. The impact on term to maturity should be relatively easy to measure at&#13;
lenders other than the Housing Bank. It is commonly noted in Jordan that lenders do not commit funds for&#13;
longer than 7-8 years, both because of liquidity concerns and because of the perceived limitations of the&#13;
Ottoman Law on cumulative interest. The average term of new housing loans could possibly increase to&#13;
about 10 years after about five years. The effect on the overall market may not be so evident because the&#13;
Housing Bank already offers longer terms on its smaller loans as part of its special role within the banking&#13;
sector. If and when all of the privileges and subsidies of the HB are removed or extended to other banks, the&#13;
terms set by the HB relative to the other banks would be of interest. Despite the fact that the HB currently&#13;
offers loans with longer terms to maturity, there are reasons to expect that increased competition among&#13;
banks, made possible by the operation of the SMF, will increase the total volume of lending. This is&#13;
because the HB currently has incentives to limit its lending through non-price rationing, since housing loans&#13;
are made at below-market interest rates. Competition may force a reduction in any such non-price rationing.&#13;
All of these dimensions of lender behavior would be tracked through regular surveys by the SMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
10.   Decrease in the Cost Qf Intermediation (impacts on financial markets). The SMF has the potential&#13;
to generate external benefits for the development of the overall financial market through its creation of&#13;
additional long-term domestic debt securities of minimal and homogeneous risk. This would allow&#13;
investors a greater choice of portfolio configurations, permit all banks greater flexibility in managing their&#13;
portfolios, and provide the basis for the development of a more liquid market in all forms of domestic debt&#13;
securities, especially corporate bonds.&#13;
11.   These benefits, however, are quite uncertain. They depend at a minimum on the success of the SMF&#13;
in developing interest in using its facilities, on the development of a competitive market in initial issuances&#13;
of the SMF, and on Jordanian investors, especially banks, trading in SMF debt as part of their asset-liability&#13;
management. The best measures of development impact in this regard would be with respect to: (a)&#13;
perceptions that there is useful information on the shape of a yield curve spanning 1-10 years out; and (b)&#13;
the occurrence of trading in the after-market for SMF debt. A intermediate measure of success in this&#13;
respect would be the posting of relevant bid prices for SMF debt on some regular basis, even if actual&#13;
transactions are not very common.&#13;
12.   Market Evaluation of Credit Risks. The SMF may have some impact on the evaluation of credit risk&#13;
by the financial markets. In principle, the credit risk of the SMF bonds should be very low, but still more&#13;
than for government debt. Since the only risk that the market has been able to evaluate in the past has been&#13;
that of the Government, a successful launch of SMF debt without a government guarantee would require&#13;
some evolution in risk assessment, and would therefore an indicator of positive development impact of the&#13;
SMF. An evaluation of this situation would be made after the first two years of the project (at the Mid Term&#13;
Review).&#13;
Development Impact Indicators for the Institutional and Regulatory Reform Measures&#13;
13.    The institutional and regulatory reform measures included in the proposed project would support the&#13;
emergence of an efficient private sector real estate industry responsive to the needs of low and moderate&#13;
income households. In particular, they would: (a) reduce the regulatory barriers that constrain the private&#13;
sector from operating in the lower income markets; and (b) launch a new Public-Private Partnership&#13;
Process to attract and promote private sector participation in land and housing development for lower&#13;
income households.&#13;
14.    The centerpiece of the institutional reform measures would be a fundamental change in HUDC's&#13;
role and mandate from that of public sector producer of serviced land to that of policy formulator,&#13;
facilitator and promoter of private sector development of land and housing for low and moderate income&#13;
households. Recently, HUDC has announced its new role and mandate in the media and has begun to solicit&#13;
private sector interest in potential land and housing development schemes. In addition, HUDC, in&#13;
consultation with local land use planning and zoning authorities, has selected about 200 hectares of sites for&#13;
private sector development of lower income housing that are well-located to employment opportunities and&#13;
existing infrastructure, to help facilitate a quick start-up of PSD operations. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained that HUDC would establish by September 30, 1996, and thereafter maintain an organizational&#13;
unit dedicated to facilitating private sector development of land and housing for lower income households.&#13;
In addition, HUDC intends to strengthen its accounting and financial systems to help facilitate effective&#13;
management planning and decision-making under the reform program. Assurances were obtained that&#13;
HUDC would, by July 31, 1998, enhance its cost allocation systems for each of its lines of business and also&#13;
establish budgeting and financial management systems to ensure full coverage of its assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
15.   To carry out its new role, HUDC would adopt a number of alternative approaches. One approach&#13;
would be to auction off to the private sector the rights to develop HUDC-owned land in accordance with&#13;
specified development criteria, such as the mix of plot sizes and price ceilings for housing units. Another&#13;
approach would be to solicit partnerships with private developers of private land, whereby HUDC offers its&#13;
expertise to facilitate design, implementation and approval processes.&#13;
16.   Beginning in 1996, the performance of the institutional reform measures would be assessed mainly&#13;
on how well HUDC attracts and facilitates private sector development in accordance with targets for&#13;
HUDC-facilitated land and housing development schemes 'carried out by wholly private sector-owned&#13;
developers. Performance would be measured by the ratio "I" (percent) of HU-JDC-facilitated private sector&#13;
land developed relative to the total land developed by HIUDC (including HUDC-assisted private sector&#13;
schemes):&#13;
I (%) =  ( PSD ) / ( HUDC + PSD)&#13;
where&#13;
IIUDC  =  total of FHUDC land development projects put under implementation (i.e. contract&#13;
signed) during the concerned calendar year expressed in number of plots (or hectares of&#13;
row land using a density of 30 plots per hectare); and&#13;
PSD  =    total of land development projects put under implementation during the concerned&#13;
calendar year by wholly private sector owned developers as a result of HUDC&#13;
facilitating role including auctioned HUDC's land development rights.&#13;
In accordance with this formula, the targets for land developed under HUDC-sponsored private sector&#13;
schemes, relative to the total land developed under HUDC programs (including sponsored private schemes),&#13;
are shown in Table 5.1 below.&#13;

17.   To the extent that the minimums are not achieved in any one year, they would be rolled over and&#13;
added to the following year's targets. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that: (a) IHUDC would&#13;
take all measures necessary to achieve the above targets including, if necessary, the reallocation to private&#13;
sector development through auction or other transparent method, the development rights on HUDC sites;&#13;
and (b) it would no longer purchase or acquire, for development purposes, additional land exceeding an&#13;
aggregate of 50 hectares, except as approved by the Minister of Public Works and Housing. HUDC's own&#13;

18.    The regulatory reforms aim to improve the environment for enabling the private sector real estate&#13;
industry to participate and compete in land and housing development for lower income households.&#13;
Performance of the project in meeting this objective would be measured against HUDC's performance in&#13;
preparing for and bringing about a revision of the laws and by-laws goveming zoning to rationalize land use.&#13;
In this regard, assurances were obtained during negotiations that, by December 31, 1996, the Govemment&#13;
would extend to the private sector, rights and privileges in land and housing development similar to those of&#13;
HUDC. Recently, however, the Government's Council of Ministers approved the regulatory reforms and&#13;
announced them in the media. In addition, assurances were obtained that, by December 31, 1998, the&#13;
Government would submit to Parliament, legislation designed to make zoning for land use more responsive&#13;
to market needs and to improve the formulation and implementation of housing policy. For this purpose,&#13;
HUDC would initiate in 1996 and complete by July 31, 1998, a comprehensive study of land use and urban&#13;
planning management regulations, for which it would carry out extensive prior consultations at national and&#13;
local levels.&#13;

Supervision Plan&#13;
20.    During the project implementation period, it is estimated that about 11 supervision missions would&#13;
be needed, with one large project inception mission initially to launch the project. Total staffweeks for&#13;
supervision is estimated to be on the order of 60 staffweeks distributed among a project team (task manager;&#13;
housing finance specialist; financial analyst; economist; urban planner; municipal engineer) and other&#13;
specialists. Project supervision would be based on an agreed set of project monitoring and development&#13;
impact indicators. Bank field supervision inputs are indicated in Table 5.3 below and total about 48&#13;
staffweeks.  These inputs are in addition to regular supervision needs at headquarters for handling&#13;
correspondence and reviewing/commenting on procurement actions, disbursement requests, progress&#13;
reports, annual audits, consultants' inception/draft final/final reports, etc., which are estimated to require&#13;
about 12 staffweeks in total, comprising about 7 staffweeks during the two first years of project&#13;
implementation and about 5 staffweeks during the remaining years. The other specialists indicated in Table&#13;
5.3 who may participate in supervision missions could include a mortgage market specialist, a financial&#13;
markets specialist, and an institutional development specialist.  This level of supervision inputs is&#13;
considered necessary because of the expected complexities associated with the start-up and operations of the&#13;
SMF, and also by the importance of close collaboration with the Govemment and HUDC in the&#13;
implementation of the institutional and regulatory reform component.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Project Cost Summary and Financing Plan&#13;
I.     The total project cost is estimated at about US$142.0 million equivalent, including an indirect&#13;
foreign exchange component of about US$19.8 million, or about 14 percent of total costs. The total project&#13;
costs include the estimated costs of: (a) a Secondary Mortgage Facility program of refinancing mortgages&#13;
(SMF refinancing program) aggregating about US$141.0 million equivalent (JD100.0 million) over a&#13;
project implementation period of five years; (b) the establishment costs of the SMF including equipment&#13;
and consulting services for training and technical assistance; and (c) technical assistance services and&#13;
training for HUDC to assist the implementation of institutional and regulatory reforms in the real sector.&#13;
Costs were estimated at November 1995 prices and include physical contingencies of 15 percent for the&#13;
SMF's equipment component. Price contingencies were calculated for the SMF establishment costs and&#13;
HUDC technical assistance components on the basis of 2.6 percent a year increase of foreign costs. The&#13;
foreign exchange costs of the SMF establishment costs and HUDC technical assistance components were&#13;
estimated at 70 percent of their total costs. The foreign exchange costs of the SMF refinancing program&#13;
(13.5 percent) were estimated assuming that about one-fifth of the loans pledged will be made for the&#13;
construction or expansion of housing, rather than the purchase of an existing house, and that their foreign&#13;
exchange costs would be financed by mortgages, rather than owner's equity, since the latter can be assumed&#13;
to be financing the land value in the first instance.&#13;
2.     The estimated cost of the project is summarized in Table 6.1.&#13;

3.     The Government would onlend to the SMF about US$19.6 million from the proceeds of the&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million (Loan) under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement having terms and&#13;
conditions approved by the Bank. About US$19.0 million of the subsidiary loan would be provided to the&#13;
SMF as a line of credit to refinance the estimated foreign exchange component of mortgages originated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
PFIs for the construction of new housing or for new renovations of existing housing. The mortgages&#13;
refinanced by the subsidiary loan are estimated to comprise at least one fifth of the total value of mortgages&#13;
refinanced by the SMF during the project implementation period. Private sector investors (mainly SSC at&#13;
the outset) would also contribute to the SMF refinancing program through the purchase of SMF bonds&#13;
(about US$122.0 million equivalent). About US$600,000 of the subsidiary loan would help to finance&#13;
equipment and technical assistance for the SMF (including contingencies). In addition, the Loan would&#13;
include about US$400,000 equivalent to help finance consulting services and technical assistance for&#13;
HUDC. Retroactive financing totaling US$200,000 equivalent is proposed for expenditures made after&#13;
August 1, 1995 in respect of technical assistance and equipment for the SMF and HUDC. The project&#13;
financing plan is presented in Table 2. Overall, the Loan would finance about 14 percent of the estimated&#13;
project cost.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Disbursement Schedule&#13;
I.    The project would be implemented over a five-year period from the estimated date of loan&#13;
effectiveness, with a completion target date of September 30, 2001 (Annex 5). The commitment deadline&#13;
for the credit line would be March 31, 2001. The loan Closing Date would be March 31, 2002, six months&#13;
after the project completion date. The disbursement period of about 5 years or 20 quarters is shorter than&#13;
the country disbursement profile of 6.5 years or 26 quarters. This is deemed achievable because: (a) thiere&#13;
are no major civil works or equipment contracts; (b) the institutional reforms should be completed within&#13;
the first 2.5 years of the project; and (c) the subsidiary loan is small relative to anticipated demand.&#13;
2.    The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table 7.1&#13;
The projected disbursement profile for the Bank loan is shown in Figure 7.1. Disbursements under the&#13;
subsidiary loan would be made against documentation submitted by PFIs evidencing that the mortgages&#13;
being refinanced are for new housing or for new renovations of existing housing. For this purpose, PFIs&#13;
would be required to separate out and certify to the SMF, those mortgages for new or renovated housing that&#13;
are included in the packages of mortgages that they submit to the SMF for refinancing. Disbursement&#13;
percentages under the credit line would vary during the implementation period, beginning with 95 percent of&#13;
mortgages for new or renovated housing refinanced until US$4 million has been disbursed; declining to 75&#13;
percent until an additional amount of US$6 million has been disbursed; and 60 percent thereafter. The&#13;
projected volume of SMF mortgage refinancing is shown in Figure 7.2. The disbursement categories are&#13;
shown in Table 7.2.&#13;

THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN&#13;
HOUSING FINANCE AND URBAN SECTOR REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis of the Secondary Mortgage Facility&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF) is intended to add a significant element to the evolving&#13;
Jordanian financial market, by serving as an intermediary between long-term lenders for housing and long-term&#13;
investors. The benefits of the SMF to long-term lenders should be reflected over time in the terns and&#13;
conditions under which banks would be willing to offer housing loans, thereby passing the benefits on to&#13;
household borrowers (viz., mortgagors). Quantitative estimates of selected, perceived economic and social&#13;
benefits of the SMF may be derived by estimating the value to lenders and households of having access to the&#13;
form of financial intermediation provided by the SMF.&#13;
Anticipated Benefits of the SMF&#13;
2.     Benefits would arise primarily from the SMF's ability to help participating financial institutions (PFls)&#13;
.reduce both interest rate risks and liquidity risks associated with their mortgage lending for housing. Currently,&#13;
banks manage interest rate risk by specifying that the rate on a mortgage loan can be changed at the bank's discretion&#13;
if its costs of funds changes. However, lenders have not attempted to use this discretion previously and there could&#13;
be difficulties in doing so. The SMF offers lenders an opportunity to more formally link the rate on housing loans to&#13;
the cost of funds, e.g., at a fixed spread over the cost of SMF funding.&#13;
3.     Lenders manage the liquidity risk of lending for housing by only lending for relatively short terms (generally&#13;
no more than 7 years) and limiting their overall housing lending.1 Even short-term commercial lending is not very&#13;
liquid and thus banks maintain unusually high overall liquidity (55 percent in October 1995 for the banking sector as&#13;
a whole). In principle, lenders could offer longer termns at rates high enough to compensate for the additional&#13;
liquidity, but in practice they do not offer a choice and simply limit their long-term lending by price and non-price&#13;
rationing. After the SMF begins to function and is perceived to be reliable, the liquidity risk of long-term housing&#13;
loans would be sharply reduced, permitting a reduction in the price and non-price barriers to longer-term borrowing.&#13;
4.     Benefits would arise for prospective mortgagors from competition among lenders causing them to pass&#13;
through the benefits from improved risk management. Prospective mortgagors should see a combination of lower&#13;
costs of funds and a longer term on the loans being offered, as well as greater interest among banks in pursuing more&#13;
lending for housing, since funds for such lending would be in ready supply.&#13;
5.     The value to consumers of these shifts in supply depends on the extent to which household borrowers are&#13;
currently constrained. Each household is facing a supply curve of funds that is flat out to the underwriting criteria of&#13;
the lenders and then becomes essentially vertical. Some households are borrowing less than the maximum possible,&#13;
others are paying various shadow costs to expand their borrowing (and implicitly facing an upward sloping supply&#13;
curve) and others, including many in the middle group, end up being non-price rationed.&#13;
'/ The only exception currently is the Housing Bank, which has a number of special privileges that reduce its chances of&#13;
ilhqWdity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.     These alternative types of demand are illustrated in Figure 8.1. The initial supply curve for credit to the&#13;
individual is SI, where price is fixed out to Ql, then rises steadily as co-signers can be brought to bear, and then&#13;
becomes vertical, as non-price rationing hniitations become binding. This curve shifts down and out to S2 once the&#13;
SMF is firmly established. The impact on the consumer surplus of households is seen to vary across the different&#13;
types of demand, numbered in the order delineated above.&#13;

Figure 8.1:  Supply and Demand for Housing Credit to the Individual Household&#13;
7.     Households which would willingly borrow more than permitted currently have demand curves (e.g., DI)&#13;
which are intersecting the supply of credit curve at a point beyond where it goes vertical; i.e., they are constrained by&#13;
underwriting ratios and not by the explicit price of credit (the interest rate). Others may be at a point on a peculiar&#13;
part of the effective supply curve, where they are expanding borrowing at an implicit extra cost by calling on faiily&#13;
members and friends to serve as co-signers of the loan (e.g., D2). For both of these types of households, an&#13;
expansion in the amount they can borrow generates substantial welfare gains, because of the gap between what they&#13;
were willing to pay for credit and the explicit price of additional credit. In addition, any decline in the cost of&#13;
borrowing in general would expand their existing consumer surplus from borrowing.&#13;
8.     There are also those households which would not, at current interest rates, borrow more than pennitted if the&#13;
term or underwriting criteria were relaxed (e.g., D3). For these households, any decline in interest rate on a 7-year&#13;
loan would be a benefit, and any increase in borrowing that such a decline might engender would be valued at an&#13;
amount equivalent to only about half of the product of the decline in interest rate times the expansion in borrowing.&#13;
9.     In the case of DI and D2, the shift in S generates an increase in consumer surplus generally greater than&#13;
simply the decline in the costs of credit. The incremental borrowing may be valued substanially more than the&#13;
explicit market price, but these benefits are difficult to quantify. For example, the typical market-rate mortgage loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
currntly carries an annual percentage rate of 13.5 percent and a repayment period of 7 years. If the interest rate is&#13;
matained but the term extended to 10 years, the maximum size loan would increase by 20 percent. The maximum&#13;
15-year loan would be 40 percent larger. However, there is no market-based information on how much more this&#13;
additional borrowing power is worth to curenly constrained households. An indirect indicator of consumer&#13;
williness is the approximate 50 basis points that mortgagors in the U.S.A. frequently pay for mortgage insurance&#13;
that enables them to buy more house by increasing their loan-to-value ratio from 80 percent to 95 percent.&#13;
10.   It is not possible in this context to establish an equivalent figure for Jordanian borrowers. The anecdotal&#13;
evidence is that most borrowers are borrowing the maximum permitted under current underwriting standards and&#13;
thus there are relatively few households with demnand curves such as D3. Since the usual loan-to-value ratio is well&#13;
below 50 percent, it seems likely that most are in category D I. In the absence of other evidence, it is assumed that all&#13;
borrowers are of this type and that they value the ability to borrow 20 percent more at an average of 50 basis points.&#13;
11.    It is difficult to predict how much the lenders might be willing to reduce their explicit price once the&#13;
presence of the SMF irnproves their risk management position. However, it appears that the gross operating margin&#13;
on housing loans is currently about 250 basis points, in contrast to a spread of 150-200 basis points in Westem&#13;
developed econonies. This would suggest the potential for a reduction of up to 50 basis points from a combination&#13;
of lower risks and greater competition.&#13;
12.   In addition to the direct benefits to lenders and borrowers, there are some external public benefits which&#13;
would also arise from improving the efficiency of investment and these should accrue to all participants in the&#13;
financial markets. In particular, Bank sector work has indicated the need for a more active debt market, but there is&#13;
relatively little Dinar-denominated government debt available in the market, and so far there has been no frequent&#13;
issuer of a low-risk, high-liquidity longer-term debt instrument. The SMF would help to fill this void by being a&#13;
relatively frequent issuer of low-risk debt securities (viz., bonds). Depending on market circumstances, many of&#13;
these securities may have rates fixed for 3, 5, or 7 years or more. Market conditions would be reflected in their rates&#13;
at the time of issuance. In addition, assuming some degree of trading is established, SMF bonds could provide a&#13;
reasonable benchmark for capital market conditions and transactions.&#13;
13.    Other benefits of the SMF are also likely to accrue, but they have not been included in the analysis here.&#13;
The SMF could help to induce greater public awareness of the importance of analyzing credit risks in the absence of&#13;
govemment guarantees, and also possibly to facilitate a reduction in the housing finance subsidies to low and&#13;
moderate income households that the Government has been channeling through a special window at the Housing&#13;
Bank (para. 19).&#13;
Costs of Intermediation&#13;
14.    The SMFNs costs of operation and of capital committed must be accounted for in detemuining net social&#13;
benefits. The costs of operation are difficult to estimate with certainty, especially as a percent of the SMF's loan&#13;
portfolio. To a great extent, the costs are independent of the volume of lending, while the volume of lending should&#13;
be very sensitive to small differences in costs. Thus, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the equilibrium level&#13;
of costs per JD intermediated.&#13;
15.   In total, the financial projections given in Annex 4 suggest that, provided the SME is able to generate a&#13;
JDIOO million portfolio in 3-5 years, a spread of about 135 basis points would be needed to cover its costs. This&#13;
spread could decrease as the costs of bond issuance are brought down and leveraging increases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Net Social Benefits&#13;
16.   It is not clear solely from the perspective of the commercial viability of the SMF, described above and in&#13;
Annex 4, that the SMF would generate net economnic and social benefits. The commercial superiority of SMF&#13;
funding over deposits would be partly based on the fact that SMF funding would not fahe a 14 percent cash reserve&#13;
requirement imposed by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) on deposits.2 The direct and indirect benefits of the SMF&#13;
need to be compared with the costs to detemine the economic rate of return separately from the issue of its financial&#13;
viability.&#13;
The Counterfactual&#13;
17.   Implicit in this analysis is the assumption that the housing finance market in Jordan would remain&#13;
unchanged in the absence of the SMF. To the extent that other adjustments could take place without the SMF, its&#13;
benefits are overstated. However, it is difficult to discem signs that the basic nature of the mortgage and bond&#13;
markets will change anytime soon in the absence of this project. Banks have reiterated their concem about the&#13;
illiquidity of mortgage lending, the real level of govenmment domestic debt outstanding is shrinking, and bank&#13;
syndications for raising medium-term funds have nearly completely replaced corporate bond issuances.&#13;
18.   It could be argued that a private sector entity would undertake to provide SMF services independently if the&#13;
market would value them highly enough. One reason that this event can be considered unlikely is the presence of the&#13;
extemal benefits to the financial market expected from the SMIF, benefits which cannot be captured by a totally&#13;
private entity (and which fomn the basis for CBJ support of the SMF). Another argument specific to Jordan is that&#13;
the private institutions with the best chance of promoting an SMF, namely the Housing Bank and the Arab Baik,&#13;
could reasonably view the SMW as undermining their competitive positions within the financial sector. But perhaps&#13;
most telling is the observation that nearly all SMFs in the world have required some degree of govemment support or&#13;
sponsorship.&#13;
19.    A more likely subtle interaction of the SMF with the Government's role in the economy may be the&#13;
facilitation of the political process of extricating the Govenmment from the continuing subsidy of housing lending to&#13;
low and moderate income households. In retum for offering smaller borrowers loans for up to 15 years at only 7&#13;
percent, the Housing Bank receives a blanket tax-exemption on all of its housing loans. Such lending is a long-&#13;
standing part of the special relationship that the Housing Bank has with the Government and which is expected to&#13;
continue for the near future, despite other shifts intended to level the playing field in commercial banking.&#13;
Estimation of the Economic Rate of Return&#13;
20.    A quantitative estimation of the econornic rate of return (ERR) for the SMF is given in Tables 8.1 and 8.2 to&#13;
this Annex. Table 8.1 sumnmrizes the main assumptions, and Table 8.2 provides the projected results, which are&#13;
also based on the financial projections given in Annex 4. It has been assumed that the share of all mortgage loans in&#13;
Jordan that are refinanced by the SMF would increase and then stabilize at 50 percent after 5 years. In addition,&#13;
during the first five years, the average term of a new loan is assumed to lengthen from 7 to 10 years.&#13;
2 / It is unlikely that the SMF would be financially viable without some kind of subsidy or other advantage, because it&#13;
is essentially a public good. All lenders would benefit from the potential of refinancing their housing loans, but&#13;
would not have to actually do so (and bear the cost) in order to enjoy this benefit. In this case, it may generate&#13;
large net social benefits but still not be financially viable.&#13;

21.      In the base case, the perception of increased liquidity is presumed to grow progressively, with a value of 20&#13;
basis points applied to it initially, growing to 50 basis points in the fourth year. This full benefit is assumed to apply&#13;
to the existing stock of loans that qualify for refinance, even if they are not actually refinanced. Thus, the lenders&#13;
enjoy a wvmdfall benefit from the reduction in risk on their existing portfolio. Meanwhile, competition should causc&#13;
them to offer longer terms and lower rates on new loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
22.     As the loan tcrms offered by lenders arc lcngthcncd. it is assumed that the 20 perccnt increase in borrou%ing&#13;
permitted by extcnding the term  from 7 to 10 years is wvorth 50 basis points to all borrowcrs. In addition, it is&#13;
assumed that the improved lending conditions and compctition steadily increase the volume of lending that the banks&#13;
are doing, cvcntually doubling it ovcr the 5 vears.&#13;
23.     Finally, it is also assumed that the activity in the market for SMF bonds gencratcs information that is useful&#13;
for raising othcr long-tcrm crcdits. The assumed cffcct of this infomiation is to reduce the cost of issuing long-term&#13;
corporate debt by 10 basis points.&#13;
24.    Table 8.2 is calculated in deflated temLs, adjusting for the fact that the projections in Anncx 4 assume a 4&#13;
pcrcent rate of inflation (e.g., SMF wages arc assumed to risc by 5 pcrccnt annually). Thus, the rate of retum&#13;
calculation is net of this inflation. The calculation is carried out for a 25 . car period starting wvith the capitalization&#13;
of JD5 million in ycar 0. Thc resulting estimated ERR for the base case is about 20.4 perccnt. If the assumed&#13;
bcncfit to the corporate bond markct is left out, the ERR is about 19.4 pcrcent.&#13;
25.    This estimate is sensitive to both the size and timing of the costs and bcncfits. At one extreme, the benefits&#13;
to the banks from incrcased liquidity and to the consumcrs from increased access to funds could be half of that&#13;
assumed in the base casc; i.e., only 25 basis points in each casc. This reduces the ERR to about 10.1 percent.&#13;
Altcrnativcly, if the only value to the constumers from longer terms is halved to 25 basis points, the ERR falls to&#13;
about 17.2 percent (the interest ratc is still assumed to fall by 50 basis points due to reduccd nsks).&#13;
26.    These results partly depend on a doubling in the volume of lending over the course of 5 years. If instead the&#13;
volume is assumcd to increasc at a more modest pacc, say 25 pcrcent ovcr 5 years, then the ERR in the base case is&#13;
rcduced to 15.4 percent. On the positive side, howcvcr, if terms offered by lenders are extended all the wav to 15&#13;
ycars, as is common in many countries, the bcnefits to borrowers from being ablc to borrow more would probably bc&#13;
greater than the 50 basis points assumed in the base case.&#13;
27.    Other downside risks includc: (a) the possibility that, whilc lendcrs may value having the potential to&#13;
refinancc thcir loans, relatively few actually do so and the SMF proves not to bc commercially viable; (b) lenders&#13;
place no value on the improved liquidity of thcir mortgage portfolios, because they have been very conservative and&#13;
have taken on little risk, and (c) the Governmcnt does not removc the subsidics to loans made by the Housing Bank,&#13;
thus reducing or eliminating the net increasc in loan terms on markct-ratc lcnding duc to the increase in liquidity.&#13;
3    This is a gray area. In the past, the HB has been able to offer longer terms and lower rates for loans because it&#13;
has received both fiscal and liquidity benefits from the Government. The liquidity benefits are already being&#13;
reduced, but not the fiscal bcnefits. On the other hand, it appears that, in return for the fiscal bencfits, the HB&#13;
would continuc to offer the longer terms as well as the lower rates, despite the illiquidity. Presumably, if the&#13;
fiscal benefits arc ended also, as planncd, then both the term and the rates would revert to market, c.g., about&#13;
13.5 perccnt for 7 years, in the absence of the SMF.&#13;

            Jordan - Housing Finance and Urban Sector
            Reform Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Housing Finance
            and Urban Sector Reform Project for the Hashemite Kingdom of
            Jordan are to improve the efficiency of the housing and
            housing finance sectors, to promote private sector
            development in land and housing production, and to reduce
            the government's role in both sectors. Through the
            establishment of a Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF), the
            project will aim to improve the efficiency with which
            medium- and longer-term financial flows of mortgage lending
            are mobilized, to facilitate and foster competition in
            market-based mortgage lending, and to lengthen the term
            structure of mortgage lending. Through the implementation of
            institutional and regulatory reforms in the real sector, the
            project will also aim to improve the enabling environment
            for responsive private sector participation and competition
            in land and housing development for lower income households.
            The first of two project components is to create an SMF
            incorporating: (a) an SMF refinancing program; (b) equipment
            for the SMF; and (c) technical assistance to the SMF. The
            second project component is to make institutional and
            regulatory reforms; more specifically, to provide technical
            assistance to the Housing and Urban Development Corporation.
