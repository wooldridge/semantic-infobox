     number of poor people continues to fall. The propor-                    that the world I see today is a world out of balance. Of&#13;
     tion of people living on less than $1 a day decreased                   the 6 billion people in the world today, 1 billion people&#13;
     from 40 to 21 percent of the global population between                  in the wealthy countries account for 80 percent of the&#13;

        The progress, though, is uneven across the globe.                        These global imbalances are reflected in the daily&#13;
     Growth in East Asia has meant that there were 500 mil-                  lives of poor people around the world. Two billion&#13;

related outcomes. Its findings present the sobering as-&#13;
sessment that, while the first goal of halving poverty&#13;
will likely be met globally, given current trends, most&#13;
countries will not meet most of the goals. A significant&#13;
and immediate increase in resources and concentrated&#13;
effort by all parties is needed to avoid falling far short&#13;
of the goals. (See "Global Monitoring of Policies and&#13;

      health care expands opportunities for poor people to&#13;

     the role of stakeholders in this process. (See "Reducing&#13;
     Poverty and Improving Economic Management" in               DEVELOP A GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR&#13;

     grate the Millennium Development Goals into their&#13;
     strategy papers, considering the cross-sectoral actions&#13;
     needed to achieve the goals. This approach will help&#13;
     ensure that country strategies address the trade-offs&#13;
     inherent in achieving the MDGs.&#13;
        The PRSP process can be complex and time con-&#13;
     suming. To ensure that it does not prevent IDA conces-&#13;
     sional lending or Heavily Indebted Poor Countries&#13;
     (HIPC) debt relief from reaching low-income coun-&#13;
     tries, the Bank introduced interim Poverty Reduction&#13;
     Strategy Papers. These PRSPs use a simpler format, and&#13;
     can thus be prepared more quickly, than full PRSPs.&#13;

    The LICUS Initiative is a new approach to engage-&#13;

strong political and economic analysis, promoting do-&#13;
mestic demand and capacity for change, supporting&#13;
simple entry-level reforms, and strengthening social&#13;
service delivery mechanisms.&#13;
    Since the initiative was launched in 2002, the Bank's&#13;
Board has discussed 7 LICUS country strategies, and&#13;
13 LICUS teams have started to develop innovative&#13;
country approaches. These approaches include activi-&#13;
ties that improve transparency in the management of&#13;
oil revenue in Angola, support the provision of basic&#13;
public goods in Somalia, and build leadership capacity&#13;
in Sudan. Analytical services to these countries in-&#13;
creased, with in-country missions undertaken in all the&#13;
countries currently in arrears on their outstanding&#13;
loans. The Bank is also improving its ability to measure&#13;
country performance at the bottom of the perfor-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    As a global development institution with broad&#13;
coverage of countries and issues, the Bank often&#13;
plays a global strategic role in providing what more&#13;
specialized agencies cannot because of their smaller&#13;
size or narrower mandate. In carrying out its partner-&#13;
ship activities, the Bank plays different roles--leader,&#13;
follower, adviser, helper, and so on--depending on&#13;
the need.&#13;
    At the global level, the Bank is working closely with&#13;
its development partners to improve aid coordination&#13;
by integrating poverty reduction efforts. (See "Simpli-&#13;
fying and Harmonizing Policies and Procedures" in&#13;
chapter 4.)&#13;
    In countries, the Bank is committed to strengthen-&#13;
ing its emphasis on effective development results. A&#13;
new poverty report and booklet--both entitled Part-&#13;
nerships in Development: Progress in the Fight against&#13;
Poverty, 2004--highlight this focus. The report aims to&#13;
provide a more comprehensive assessment of how the&#13;
Bank works with other organizations to help countries&#13;
achieve the vision of poverty reduction embodied in&#13;
the MDGs and the Monterrey Consensus. Using&#13;
country examples, the publications highlight the broad     security in Bolivia, Columbia, India, Latvia, Uganda,&#13;
range of activities the Bank pursues to promote growth     and Vietnam. A spotlight on Niger shows one way&#13;
and reduce poverty in its multiple dimensions.             in which the Bank is working more closely with its&#13;

agriculture in OECD countries make it difficult for           2004: $16.6 billion&#13;

    The Bank is promoting several initiatives that seek&#13;
to sustain growth and diversify the African economy. It&#13;
is supporting policy and institutional reforms to im-&#13;
prove the investment climate and make Africa a good&#13;
business destination. It has worked with regional insti-&#13;
tutions to formulate regional integration strategies that&#13;
promote the liberalization of intraregional trade, the&#13;
harmonization of macroeconomic policies, capacity&#13;
building for regional institutions, the growth of capital&#13;
markets, and the building of regional infrastructure,&#13;
including transportation corridors. The demands are&#13;
enormous: Africa's infrastructure needs alone are&#13;
estimated at about $18 billion a year.&#13;

Programs such as Indonesia's Kecamatan Development&#13;
Project have been extremely effective in channeling&#13;
funds directly to communities to build roads, schools,&#13;
health clinics, and drinking-water systems. Under the&#13;
program, which now covers 28,000 villages and about&#13;
35 million rural poor, communities determine their&#13;
needs, design activities, seek technical help, and make&#13;
informed choices about how to use limited resources.         c. 1970. Loading rubber at the Port of Singapore, where a World Bank&#13;

      Administration sector, changes in figures reflect the retroactive remapping of projects to a new Compulsory Health Finance sector code under this category. For the Finance&#13;

     RELATED ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
     About 1.1 billion people--one-fifth of the world's&#13;
     population--live on less than $1 a day. The Bank's&#13;
     strategy for fighting poverty in low-income countries is&#13;
     based on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)&#13;
     approach (www.worldbank.org/prsp). This approach&#13;
     has resulted in broader country ownership of the&#13;
     poverty reduction agenda as well as improved partici-&#13;

         The Bank's work on poverty reduction is guided by       Bank lending for governance, public sector reform, and&#13;

    During fiscal 2004 the Bank supported implemen-&#13;

GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
&#13;
Gender equality issues are now integrated into most&#13;
Country Assistance Strategies, and Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Papers are increasingly gender sensitive.&#13;
Gender issues are also important in Bank-financed&#13;
projects, particularly in education, health, and social&#13;
protection.&#13;
    Numerous Bank-supported operations are promot-&#13;

Revitalizing Infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Infrastructure is a key factor in reducing poverty,&#13;
supporting growth, and reaching the Millennium&#13;
Development Goals in developing countries. But&#13;
existing infrastructure is often poor, access limited,&#13;
and funds to improve it inadequate.&#13;
    The World Bank supports a wide range of infra-&#13;
structure services in transportation; water supply and&#13;
sanitation; urban services; telecommunications; and&#13;
energy, including electricity and extractive industries&#13;
such as oil, gas, and mining (see also "External Evalua-&#13;
tion" in chapter 4). It supports infrastructure service&#13;
delivery, reform, and institution building through&#13;
policy dialogue and physical investments. It also acts&#13;
as a catalyst to leverage financial and other assistance&#13;
from development partners and the private sector to&#13;
support technical assistance. The Bank made a new&#13;
commitment in fiscal 2004 to infrastructure with the&#13;
launch of the Infrastructure Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
POVERTY ALLEVIATION, THE MDGs,&#13;
AND GROWTH&#13;
&#13;
Estimates show that in the late 1990s infrastructure in-&#13;
vestments reduced poverty by as much as 2.1 percent&#13;
in low-income countries and 1.4 percent in middle-&#13;
income countries. Improving infrastructure services&#13;
such as water supply and sanitation is an explicit target&#13;
in the Millennium Development Goals, and improving&#13;
services such as housing and information and commu-&#13;
nication technologies is at least implicit in the goals.&#13;
Infrastructure services also have an impact on the goals&#13;
relating to health, education, and gender. Increasing&#13;
access to clean water, for example, has reduced the&#13;
                                                            Solar energy lights a village shop in Sri Lanka.&#13;
probability of child mortality by 55 percent overall.&#13;
Paved roads have significantly increased--and in one&#13;
case doubled--the attendance of girls at school.&#13;
    Infrastructure also has important links to economic     during the 1980s and 1990s. A recent study of Latin&#13;
growth. Infrastructure investment is particularly im-       America estimated that the lack of investment in infra-&#13;
portant to growth during the early stages of a country's    structure during the 1990s reduced long-term growth&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
     ranks lack of infrastructure as one of the key impedi-&#13;
     ments to investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ACCESS, QUALITY, AND FINANCING NEEDS&#13;
&#13;
     The unmet access, quality, and financing needs for in-&#13;
     frastructure services in developing countries remain&#13;
     staggering. In rural areas in low-income countries, only&#13;
     2 percent of the population has access to electricity,&#13;
     and less than 2 percent has access to a mainline tele-&#13;
     phone. Infrastructure needs are sizable in most middle-&#13;
     income countries and in urban areas as well.&#13;
        Lack of access is compounded by the low quality of&#13;
     infrastructure services. Relative to OECD (Organisa-&#13;
     tion for Economic Co-operation and Development)&#13;
     countries adopting best practices, energy losses are&#13;
     twice as large, water losses four times as high, and&#13;
     faulty telephone lines ten times more common in low-&#13;
     income countries. Eighty percent of roads are paved in     c. 1955. The Anchicaya dam and power station serve the fast-growing&#13;

   Supporting Private Sector Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      The Private Sector Development Network identifies the&#13;
      regulatory reforms, policies, and institutional capacities&#13;
      needed to create a vibrant investment climate. Building&#13;
      such a climate is crucial to promoting growth where&#13;
      poor people live. Research and practice show that such&#13;
      growth is key to reducing poverty.&#13;
         Growth has not taken hold in many countries,&#13;
      despite the important reforms of the 1980s and 1990s.&#13;
      Those reforms focused largely on macroeconomic&#13;
      stabilization, neglecting important microeconomic&#13;
      reforms, including streamlining the rules governing&#13;
      the establishment and operation of a business. Such&#13;
      reforms are crucial, as many microeconomic factors--&#13;
      including laws and regulations, public institutions,&#13;
      and civic habits that make it difficult for entrepre-&#13;
      neurs to start formal businesses, borrow money,&#13;
      and hire workers--limit the potential for economic&#13;
      growth.&#13;
         The Bank's strategy is to develop a second genera-&#13;
      tion of reforms focused on improving microeconomic&#13;
      conditions for private sector investment and growth.&#13;
      The network is providing better data through new&#13;
      survey tools that can be used to analyze the elements&#13;
      of a good investment climate and to translate that&#13;
      knowledge into Bank lending and advisory services&#13;
      that support actual reforms in developing countries.&#13;
      The strategy includes promoting responsible business&#13;
      practices and corporate governance; targeting support&#13;
      for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, and&#13;
      advancing privatization policies that work in suitable,&#13;
      competitive contexts so that the private sector can&#13;
      successfully offer goods and services.&#13;
         Private sector development work spans many&#13;
      parts of the Bank. This cross-cutting theme, found in&#13;
      both lending instruments and economic and sector&#13;

these practices would also ensure greater transparency&#13;

   The relative impact of natural disasters on develop-&#13;

on developed ones, largely because the infrastructure in&#13;
developing countries is less resilient, the building stan-&#13;

     Concern for global stability and prosperity requires        future work. The plan emphasizes action in three&#13;

2004, reviewed global prospects for reaching the                         and are possible in South Asia and the Middle East and&#13;
MDGs. It identified reasons for optimism, as well as                     North Africa. Gender gaps are the most serious in these&#13;
reasons for grave concern. At the global level, the first                three regions as well. Although the MDG target date for&#13;
goal--of halving income poverty between 1990 and                         gender equality in primary and secondary education is&#13;
2015--will most likely be met, because of stronger eco-                  2005, it appears that, globally, about a third of develop-&#13;

The first Global Monitoring Report was the main agenda item for the spring 2004 meeting of the Development Committee, a forum of the&#13;
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that works to build consensus on development issues. The report was prepared by&#13;
Bank and IMF staff, collaborating closely with partner agencies, including other multilateral development banks, the Organisation for Eco-&#13;
nomic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization. The report will underpin the Development&#13;
Committee's regular monitoring of progress on the policy agenda for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and related developments&#13;
and reinforce the accountabilities of the key actors--developed and developing countries, as well as multilateral agencies.&#13;

      Note: Data are not given for the first Millennium Development Goal: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The Bank's overall mission is to reduce poverty. Therefore, all of its&#13;
      lending is linked to the first goal. The number of projects includes fractions because of the system employed for counting, which identifies projects that address more than one&#13;
      goal and is designed to avoid double counting or overreporting of deliverables. Numbers have been rounded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The cost of achieving the MDGs is difficult to esti-                                    for each goal, and they cut across many sectors. The&#13;
     mate for several reasons. One is that putting a price                                         interdependence of goals implies that costing each&#13;
     tag on achieving these goals requires distinguishing                                          goal separately could result in double counting.&#13;
     between average and marginal cost. In education, the                                          The effectiveness of additional expenditure also&#13;
     marginal cost of enrolling a child could be higher than                                       depends on appropriate changes in policies and&#13;
     the average cost, because children not in school might                                        institutions.&#13;
     be harder to induce to attend school or may live in&#13;
     more scattered populations. Another is that progress                                          Bank Lending for the MDGs&#13;
     on one goal contributes to progress on other goals.                                           In fiscal 2004 the Bank analyzed the level of all new&#13;
