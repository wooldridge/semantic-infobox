       Africa Social Safety Net and Social Protection Assessment Series&#13;
&#13;
Until recently, most countries in Africa implemented safety nets and social protection programs only on an&#13;
ad hoc basis. In the wake of the global economic, food and fuel price crises starting in 2008, however,&#13;
policymakers in Africa began to increasingly view safety nets as core instruments for reducing poverty,&#13;
addressing inequality, and helping poor and vulnerable households to manage risk more effectively.&#13;
During FY2009-2013, to support governments in their quest to understand better how to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of safety nets in their countries, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Africa Region undertook&#13;
social safety net or social protection assessments in a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2014&#13;
assessments have been completed or are under preparation for over 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
These assessments analyze the status of social protection programs and safety nets, their strengths and&#13;
weaknesses and identify areas for improvement, all with the aim of helping governments and donors to&#13;
strengthen African safety net systems and social protection programs to protect and promote poor and&#13;
vulnerable people. They were all carried-out with the explicit aim of informing governmentsâ&#128;&#153; social&#13;
protection policies and programs. With the results of analytical work like these assessments and other&#13;
types of support, safety nets and social protection programs are rapidly changing across Africa. For a&#13;
cross-country regional review, please see "Reducing Poverty and Investing in People: The New Role of&#13;
Safety Nets in Africa," which pulls together the findings and lessons learned from these assessments and&#13;
other recent studies of safety net programs in Africa.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Abstract&#13;
&#13;
Swaziland has a number of social transfer programs, but these are not well coordinated and&#13;
there is a need to better define the overall priorities of the overall safety net. Swaziland&#13;
spends a significant amount on safety nets but there is room to increase the efficiency of&#13;
spending by: (i) improving coordination between programs; (ii) making adjustments to&#13;
program design and implementation; and (iii) removing some inefficient programs. Social&#13;
transfers could play a larger role in reducing poverty but there are gaps in how well the&#13;
safety net supports extremely poor households with children and/or unemployed&#13;
household members. The assessment recommends that Swaziland should consider adopting&#13;
a national child grant program and a public works program to fill these gaps.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Like many other countries, Swaziland faces daunting challenges, including widespread&#13;
poverty, HIV/AIDS and its consequences, and shocks caused by the global financial crisis and&#13;
price increases for food and fuel. In this context, it is vitally important that Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
efforts to protect our poorest and most vulnerable are carefully constructed to maximize&#13;
their impact and cost-effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
The report focuses on the social safety net, particularly cash and in-kind transfers. The&#13;
safety net can play an important role in addressing poverty and vulnerability; however, the&#13;
process by which the safety nets have been developed in Swaziland has produced a&#13;
fragmented system that leaves many Swazis unprotected by the safety net. Improvements&#13;
in efficiency and effectiveness are both necessary and possible.&#13;
&#13;
Building on careful and detailed analysis of a wealth of data on safety net programs and&#13;
expenditures in Swaziland and other developing countries, this report addresses the various&#13;
challenges in a thorough yet accessible manner. This report highlights many areas in which&#13;
Swaziland is challenged in providing an adequate safety net and identifies areas where a&#13;
determined effort must be made to ensure that programs are efficient and effective so that&#13;
they reach the most disadvantaged.&#13;
&#13;
As Swaziland navigates this period of fiscal crisis, it is essential that we craft a social safety&#13;
net that helps vulnerable households to weather shocks and promotes investments in&#13;
human capital development of children and facilitates transitions into the labor market.&#13;
The Deputy Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office is hopeful that this report will be used as a starting point&#13;
for all those interested in promoting an efficient, effective, and sustainable safety net in&#13;
Swaziland.&#13;

&#13;
                                          Main Messages&#13;
     ï&#130;·     Swaziland implements a number of social transfer programs, but these are not well&#13;
     coordinated and there is a need to better define the overall priorities and objectives of&#13;
     the safety net.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·     Swaziland spends a significant amount on social safety nets (2.2 percent of GDP),&#13;
     but there is room to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of spending by: (i)&#13;
     improving coordination between programs working towards the same objective; (ii)&#13;
     making adjustments to the design and implementation of these programs; and (iii)&#13;
     removing programs that are not contributing to the overall objective of the safety net.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·     Social transfers could play a larger role in reducing poverty by more efficiently and&#13;
     effectively targeting the poorest and most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·     The existing safety net provides important support, but there are gaps, particularly&#13;
     with respect to extremely poor households with children and poor rural households with&#13;
     unemployed household members.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·     Swaziland should consider adopting a national child grant program and a public&#13;
     works program to fill existing gaps in the safety net. Two useful first steps would be to: (i)&#13;
     learn lessons from the upcoming cash transfer pilot for orphans and vulnerable children&#13;
     and (ii) pilot a public works program in rural areas.&#13;

1.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       Persistent poverty in Swaziland, exacerbated by the devastating impact of the&#13;
Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), the&#13;
global financial crisis, external commodity price shocks (particularly for food and fuel),&#13;
and the deteriorating fiscal situation, makes it difficult for the government to protect its&#13;
poorest and most vulnerable citizens. It is in this context that this report examines the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s existing social safety net programs with a particular focus on social transfers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 ix&#13;
&amp;#12;makes some recommendations about how to make the safety net more effective, efficient,&#13;
and sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.     POVERTY AND VULNERABILITY IN SWAZILAND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.     In 2009/10, 63 percent of the total Swazi population of 1.2 million was estimated&#13;
to live below the poverty line. This estimate was down from 69 percent in 2000/01, which&#13;
translates into a reduction in the number of poor people from 678,500 in 2000/01 to&#13;
641,000 in 2009/10. However, this decline in poverty has not been equally distributed&#13;
throughout the country. Nor has extreme poverty declined significantly. Although the&#13;
percentage of extreme poor households in the population declined slightly over the decade,&#13;
the number of extreme poor actually increased due to population growth â&#128;&#147; from around&#13;
288,000 in 2001 to 295,000 in 2010. Swaziland has experienced relatively modest growth in&#13;
recent years, but this has not benefitted the poorest segments of the population. Growth&#13;
rates in consumption have been significantly higher for those in the middle part of the&#13;
income distribution than for those in the bottom 30 percent who experienced a further&#13;
reduction in income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.     The most important features of poverty in Swaziland are its pervasiveness and its&#13;
homogeneity. The elderly and children are poorer than active-aged adults but not by as&#13;
much as in many other medium-income countries. Seventy percent of children aged 15 and&#13;
younger are poor and 71 percent of people aged 60 and over are poor. Households with no&#13;
elderly or child members constitute only 9 percent of the population, but far fewer of them&#13;
are poor (only 25 percent) than households that include both (78 percent). The number of&#13;
children under the age of 18 in a household is strongly correlated with poverty as poverty&#13;
rates increase from 45 percent for households with one child to 90 to 100 percent in&#13;
households with eight or more children. The larger the household, the more likely it is that&#13;
the household will be poor. Also, poverty incidence among households with six or more&#13;
members is higher than the national average.&#13;
                                               x&#13;
&amp;#12;4.     Poverty and extreme poverty in Swaziland are both overwhelmingly rural&#13;
phenomena. The incidence of poverty is 73 percent in rural areas but only 31 percent in&#13;
urban areas. Eighty-eight percent of the poor and 95 percent of the extreme poor live in&#13;
rural areas, and the average consumption of the urban poor is 33 percent below the&#13;
poverty line while it is 51 percent below the poverty line among the rural poor. Also,&#13;
poverty is deeper in rural areas than it is in urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.     School enrollment rates and poverty status are correlated, especially at the&#13;
secondary level. Fifty-six percent of children in the wealthiest quintile are enrolled in&#13;
secondary school compared to fewer than 26 percent of children in the lowest quintile. Cost&#13;
is the primary reason given by survey respondents for why their children do not attend&#13;
school, and this is true irrespective of wealth status. Keeping children in school is crucial&#13;
since poverty is associated with a lack of education in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.     The nutritional status of children and their poverty status are correlated. Six&#13;
percent of children under the age of 5 in Swaziland are underweight. Thirty-one percent of&#13;
children are stunted or too short for their age and 3 percent are wasted or too thin for their&#13;
height. Children from households that are poor are much more likely to be malnourished&#13;
than their wealthier counterparts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.     Both poverty and low agricultural productivity are widespread, with noticeable&#13;
fluctuations at the district level. Households living on Swazi Nation Land (75 percent of&#13;
whom are poor) are less productive than commercial producers who produce on land for&#13;
which they have a title deed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xi&#13;
&amp;#12;3.     EXISTING TRANSFER AND OTHER SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.     The safety net system is comprised of multiple cash and in-kind transfers, social&#13;
care services, active labor market programs, and community-based programs&#13;
implemented by at least five ministries or departments within ministries. Agencies&#13;
delivering safety net services include the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) within the&#13;
Deputy Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office (DPM), the National Emergency Response Council on HIV&#13;
and AIDS (NERCHA), the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), the Ministry of Health,&#13;
and the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) in the DPMâ&#128;&#153;s Office. The following&#13;
table lists the programs that currently make up Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s safety net.&#13;

&#13;
9.     In FY2010/11, Swaziland spent E584.4 million (US$82.4 million) on its safety net.&#13;
This figure encompasses expenditures on cash and in-kind transfers, community-based&#13;
programs, active labor market programs, and social care services. Between FY2005/06 and&#13;
FY2010/11, safety net expenditures increased both in real terms and as a percentage of&#13;
GDP. At about 2.2 percent of GDP in 2010/11, spending on the safety net in Swaziland is&#13;
higher than the average of 1 to 2 percent spent by most developing countries but is lower&#13;
than the amount spent by several other Southern African countries (including Malawi,&#13;
Botswana, Mauritius, and South Africa). Expenditures on cash transfers were E131.6 million&#13;
                                              xii&#13;
&amp;#12;(US$18.6 million) in FY2010/11 or about 23 percent of safety net expenditures, while&#13;
expenditures on in-kind transfers were E403.8 million (US$57.0 million) or about 69 percent&#13;
of safety net spending. Other programs received 8 percent of the safety net budget.&#13;
Between FY2006/07 and FY 2010/11, expenditures on the Old Age Grant (OAG) direct&#13;
transfers increased from E42.6 million to E100.3 million (US$6.1 million to US$14.2 million)&#13;
or by 135 percent in nominal terms and 72 percent in real terms. Capital expenditures,&#13;
which include externally funded and local capital projects, accounted for about 21 percent&#13;
of total safety net spending and represented a declining share of overall safety net&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.     Old Age Grants (OAG), the largest cash transfer program in Swaziland, has the&#13;
potential to have a greater impact on poverty.1 It was introduced in 2005 to cushion the&#13;
impact on the elderly of the loss of support resulting from the deaths of their adult children&#13;
and the increasing burden of caring for orphaned grandchildren. Qualitative evidence&#13;
suggests that the OAG has had a positive impact on beneficiaries` lives but has not&#13;
contributed much in terms of reducing poverty because a significant share of OAG&#13;
resources go to non-poor households. The age of eligibility for the OAG is lower than that&#13;
for equivalent programs in many other countries, but the value of the benefit is broadly&#13;
comparable. The irregular disbursement of benefits makes it difficult for recipients to rely&#13;
on the payment, which is particularly problematic at particular times in the year when&#13;
beneficiaries could use some of the cash for productive purposes, for example, at the start&#13;
of the planting season in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.     Programs for children have suffered from significant implementation challenges&#13;
and an unclear policy framework. The OVC (Orphans and Vulnerable Children) Education&#13;
Grant Program has had difficulty tracking individual students. There is no policy on whether&#13;
students should pay any fees not covered by the grant, and some children are required to&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 While the study recognizes that political economy is an important aspect of social protection, assessment of&#13;
political economy of social safety nets is beyond the scope of this study.&#13;
                                                     xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;pay the remaining fee while others are not. In addition, the OVC Education Grant covers&#13;
only a part of the official fees and does not fund the other out-of-pocket costs of education.&#13;
As a result, the cost of education remains the primary reason why families do not send their&#13;
children to school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.    Although the government has made efforts to provide social protection to the&#13;
poor and vulnerable, substantial numbers of poor and vulnerable people, particularly&#13;
children, remain unprotected. For example, Swaziland has no cash assistance program for&#13;
extremely poor households with children. The OVC Education Grant Program reaches only&#13;
about 40 percent of children in the poorest quintiles and does not cover all of the significant&#13;
out-of-pocket costs of education. The OAG benefits children indirectly if they live in a&#13;
household with an elderly person, but 55 percent of poor children and 56 percent of very&#13;
poor children do not live with an elderly person. When the government suspended the&#13;
indigent category from the Public Assistance program in response to the fiscal crisis, this&#13;
meant that what little support was available for very poor households with children is no&#13;
longer available. Even when it was operating, the indigent category served fewer than 1,000&#13;
beneficiaries, which represents not even 1 percent of the extreme poor. The school feeding&#13;
programs provide support to all schoolchildren, but those children who cannot afford to go&#13;
to school do not benefit. Also, the absence of any public works program in Swaziland means&#13;
that unemployed youths and adults have no way to raise any income to smooth the&#13;
consumption of their households or support them in the aftermath of shocks or crises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    Improvements in administrative efficiency and accountability are possible.&#13;
Information on the administrative costs of safety net programs is incomplete, but the&#13;
available data suggest that the administrative costs of Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s safety net programs are&#13;
high relative to those in other countries. The programs rely on a variety of mechanisms to&#13;
get their grants to the beneficiary households. There has been a gradual movement towards&#13;
paying OAG beneficiaries electronically, but the transition has been slower than in many&#13;
other countries. At the same time, the transaction costs involved in bank-deposited benefits&#13;
                                             xiv&#13;
&amp;#12;are also high relative to other countries. Economies of scale could be realized if programs&#13;
were to share certain common functions, such as targeting, registration, information&#13;
management, and monitoring and evaluation. Also, having a central beneficiary registry&#13;
would provide important monitoring and planning information and could help to reduce&#13;
fraud and abuse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.    Swaziland needs an effective safety net response to shocks and other crises. In&#13;
what is known as a â&#128;&#156;countercyclicalâ&#128;&#157; approach, government spending on safety nets should&#13;
ideally increase in times when households are facing crises or shocks to help them to&#13;
weather the shock and then should decrease as the impact of the shock subsides. However,&#13;
the Government of Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s response to the fiscal crisis has been to reduce expenditures&#13;
on safety net programs, particularly cash transfers, by delaying payments to some OAG&#13;
recipients and eliminating the element of Public Assistance that was intended to target the&#13;
poor. At the same time, many shocks experienced in Swaziland are seasonal shocks that can&#13;
usually be anticipated, and there is evidence from other countries that predictable cash&#13;
transfers may therefore be a more appropriate response to this pattern of seasonal risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.    Each program has its own unique constraints, but there are some general&#13;
constraints that affect all programs. The monitoring of programsâ&#128;&#153; performance and impact&#13;
is almost universally weak, and there has been no rigorous impact evaluation of any safety&#13;
net program. Accountability and control need to be strengthened, including more modern&#13;
information systems, updated accounting systems, more modern payment mechanisms for&#13;
cash benefits, and more transparent targeting systems. The introduction of public&#13;
information and education campaigns, appeals mechanisms, documented policies and&#13;
procedures, and regular process audits would also help to promote accountability and&#13;
control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16.    The financial sustainability of several social transfer programs is questionable&#13;
given their reliance on external funding. This includes the School Feeding Program,&#13;
                                             xv&#13;
&amp;#12;Neighborhood Care Points, and other smaller programs. About 21 percent of total safety&#13;
net spending is spent through the capital budget (on both external and local capital&#13;
projects), and the sustainability of this spending can only be ensured if these items can be&#13;
absorbed into the recurrent budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.      TARGETING AND THE SAFETY NET IN SWAZILAND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.     Programs could do a better job of identifying the vulnerable. Targeted programs&#13;
each have their own application procedures and eligibility criteria, and these multiple&#13;
targeting mechanisms increase administrative costs. Also, some people such as the poor or&#13;
children from child-headed households can find it difficult to navigate the system. The&#13;
targeting criteria for many programs are subjective, which increases the likelihood of&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors. The government has developed new criteria aimed at making&#13;
the identification of OVCs more transparent, but they are still very vague and open to&#13;
subjective interpretation. Developing more objective and transparent targeting mechanisms&#13;
could significantly reduce the problems that can result in inclusion and exclusion errors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.     There is a need for more solid evidence about which targeting methods work best&#13;
in the context of Swaziland, but the little evidence that exists indicates that the safety net&#13;
programs are not particularly well targeted to the poorest. It is important for the&#13;
government to start testing different targeting methods (or combinations of methods) in a&#13;
systematic way in order to learn lessons relevant to the Swazi context that will enable the&#13;
safety net to better reach the poorest. It is however important to note that the choice of&#13;
targeting method is not as important as the effective implementation of whichever method&#13;
is selected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     Some countries have developed a single unified registration system covering all&#13;
safety net programs, an idea which the government could consider adopting. A unified&#13;
registration system or at a minimum a unified registry of beneficiaries would increase the&#13;
                                             xvi&#13;
&amp;#12;efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of targeting and reduce duplications and&#13;
overlaps. It is worth exploring both of these options further to determine if they are feasible&#13;
and desirable in the context of Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.     TOWARDS EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIVE SOCIAL TRANSFERS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.    Persistent poverty and inequality in Swaziland provides a strong justification for&#13;
spending on social transfers. Based on our analysis throughout this report, we believe that&#13;
it would make sense to target poor elderly people and poor children, as well as unemployed&#13;
people in rural areas. The key attributes of poverty that we recommend that the&#13;
government should focus on are low human capital development and unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.    Swaziland needs a well-articulated social safety net strategy. Swaziland currently&#13;
has an uncoordinated set of safety net programs and a number of policy documents that&#13;
cover some aspects of social protection, but they do not form a coherent whole. A range of&#13;
social transfer programs exist in Swaziland that collectively attempt to reduce poverty and&#13;
vulnerability, but gaps in the safety net remain. In particular, extremely poor children and&#13;
extremely poor unemployed youths and adults are not adequately protected by the current&#13;
safety net. To improve the implementation and coordination of safety net programs, there&#13;
is a need to strengthen institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.    A well-crafted safety net should consist of a range of programs that address the&#13;
critical risks and vulnerability faced by the population and that serve the dual role of&#13;
protection and promotion. The analysis in this report suggests that the core safety net in&#13;
Swaziland could consist of the following existing and proposed programs:&#13;
&#13;
                           Existing                                      New&#13;
       Old Age Grant                                 Child Grant (pilot initially)&#13;
       OVC Education Grant                           Public Works (pilot initially)&#13;
       School Feeding Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xvii&#13;
&amp;#12;23.    These core safety net programs are affordable, but the Government of Swaziland&#13;
will need to make a strong fiscal commitment to its social safety net. Using a medium cost&#13;
scenario, we estimate that expenditures on the core programs would amount to about&#13;
E428.6 million (US$60.5 million). This represents 4.3 percent of central government&#13;
spending and about 1.6 percent of GDP. The government spent an estimated E584.4 million&#13;
on the safety net in FY2010/11. With no changes in any of the other existing safety&#13;
programs that are not included in the core and adding the two core programs as proposed,&#13;
the new total is estimated to be E607.5 million (US$85.7 million) or 6 percent of central&#13;
government spending and 2.2 percent of GDP. With only a 10 percent reduction in&#13;
expenditures on the existing â&#128;&#156;non-coreâ&#128;&#157; programs, the proposed options would be&#13;
essentially budget neutral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Way Forward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.    This review of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s social transfers indicates that many of the elements of&#13;
an appropriate safety net are present but that it ought to be possible to increase&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness. Based on the analysis in this report, the safety net strategy&#13;
could include the following elements:&#13;

A.         Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.         Swaziland faces daunting challenges in its efforts to provide an adequate safety&#13;
net for its population of 1.2 million. Persistent poverty, exacerbated by the devastating&#13;
impact of HIV/AIDS, the global financial crisis, external commodity price shocks (particularly&#13;
for food and fuel), and the deteriorating fiscal situation, makes it difficult for the&#13;
Government of Swaziland to protect its poorest and most vulnerable citizens. Meanwhile,&#13;
the informal safety net has been overwhelmed, and the need for formal safety nets will&#13;
continue to increase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.         The progress made so far in reducing poverty has not helped the very poorest.&#13;
Although poverty declined from 69 percent in 2000 to 63 percent in 2010, it remains high.&#13;
About 641,000 Swazis are poor, of whom approximately 295,000 are extremely poor&#13;
(including about 181,000 children) and are unable to meet their daily nutritional needs.2&#13;
Despite the overall decrease in poverty over the last decade, the share of extremely poor&#13;
people in the population has remained essentially the same (30 percent in 2000 and 29&#13;
percent in 2010). Growth in consumption has been significantly higher for those households&#13;
in the middle part of the income distribution, whereas those in the bottom 30 percent of&#13;
the distribution experienced a further reduction in consumption.3 In addition to poverty,&#13;
every year Swazi households face the risk of other shocks, to which the poor are typically&#13;
most vulnerable, including the seasonal unpredictability of the food supply, food price&#13;
increases, droughts, floods, and the sickness and death of the working members of their&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    See Chapter 2 for a more detailed discussion of poverty and vulnerability.&#13;

    CSO (2011c).&#13;
                                                         1&#13;
&amp;#12;3.      Social indicators highlight the magnitude of the challenges that the country faces.&#13;
The United Nationsâ&#128;&#153; Human Development Report ranked Swaziland very low in terms of the&#13;
well-being of its citizens - at 140 out of 187 countries.4 Moreover, its Human Development&#13;
Index (HDI) score has deteriorated from 0.641 in 1995 to 0.522 in 2011. The HDI for&#13;
Swaziland is now approximately equal to the average for all of Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1).&#13;
This decline can largely be attributed to the decline in life expectancy, which stood at 59&#13;
years in the early 1990s but had dropped to 49 years by 2010. On a positive note,&#13;
Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s score on the Education Index, a component of the HDI, continues to improve,&#13;
with more children accessing education than in previous years. The key social protection&#13;
challenge will be to ensure that safety net programs are designed in a way that will continue&#13;
these education gains.&#13;

4.      The current economic and fiscal crises have compounded the countryâ&#128;&#153;s already&#13;
significant challenges. Real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 0.3 percent in 2011,&#13;
compared with 2.0 percent in 2010 and an average of 3.0 percent in the pre-crisis period.&#13;
Inflation increased from 4.5 percent in 2010 to 5.5 percent in 2011, but this was still much&#13;
lower than the peak of 12.6 percent recorded in 2008.5 The impact of the global financial&#13;

  The ranking is based on a composite measure that covers three dimensions of human welfare (income,&#13;
education, and health) and serves as an indicator of national well-being.&#13;
5&#13;
  IMF (2011)&#13;
                                                    2&#13;
&amp;#12;and economic crisis on the economy of Swaziland mostly manifested itself in the form of&#13;
contracted demand for Swazi exports, with the manufacturing sector being particularly&#13;
affected. Unemployment stood at 28.5 percent in 2010 and, if discouraged workers 6 are&#13;
included, that rate increases to 40.6 percent. Unemployment has a strong rural dimension&#13;
in that it is much higher (37.1 percent) in rural areas than in urban areas (16.7 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      The global financial and economic crisis has contributed to the unprecedented fall&#13;
in Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s trade-related revenue from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU).&#13;
Swaziland recorded fiscal surpluses in the period leading up to the global financial crisis as a&#13;
result of SACU revenue transfers. Between 2008/09 and 2010/11, Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s SACU receipts&#13;
fell by 56 percent from E6.0 billion to E2.6 billion, largely due to the reduction in trade.7 The&#13;
fiscal deficit is expected to have reached close to 10 percent of GDP in FY2011/12.8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      Sluggish economic growth and revenue shortfalls have made it difficult for the&#13;
Government of Swaziland to finance its key safety net programs. Going forward it will&#13;
need to ensure that it maximizes the returns to its investments in its social safety net. It is in&#13;
this context that this report examines the countryâ&#128;&#153;s social safety net with a particular focus&#13;
on social transfers and makes recommendations for making it more effective, efficient, and&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.      Why Safety Nets are Important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.      Social safety nets consist of non-contributory transfer programs targeted to the&#13;
poor or vulnerable. A countryâ&#128;&#153;s safety net typically includes some combination of cash and&#13;
in-kind transfers, subsidies, public works programs,9 social care services, and community-&#13;
based interventions. The safety net could and should form an important part of the overall&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
  Defined as workers who have stopped looking for jobs but who want to work and are available to work.&#13;

  Also referred to as workfare or short-term employment programs.&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;poverty reduction strategy in the long run while also helping to reduce extreme poverty in&#13;
the short run. Safety net programs help to reduce the welfare losses that households&#13;
experience when shocks occur and are an important tool for reducing householdsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
vulnerability to a range of factors, including but not limited to poverty. Safety nets can also&#13;
help households to invest in productive activities and in the development of their own&#13;
human capital, both of which can ultimately increase productivity and income and in this&#13;
way be a tool for promoting human development, economic growth, and sustainable&#13;
poverty reduction (Box 1).&#13;
&#13;
                    Box 1: How Do Safety Nets Contribute to Development Policy?&#13;
&#13;
Safety nets are one part of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s broader poverty reduction strategy. They interact with and exist&#13;
alongside social insurance, health, education, and financial services, the provision of utilities and roads, and&#13;
other programs and policies that aim to reduce poverty and minimize risk. Safety net programs can play four&#13;
main roles in development policy:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Safety nets redistribute income to the poorest and most vulnerable, which has an immediate impact in terms of&#13;
    reducing poverty and inequality. The strong consensus in most countries is that adequate provision should be&#13;
    made to protect the poor, though there may be different beliefs about how this should be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Safety nets can enable households to make more and better investments in their future. They do so basically&#13;
    by compensating for the absence of credit markets for the poor, thus allowing these households to take&#13;
    advantage of investment opportunities that they would otherwise miss - both in the human capital of their&#13;
    children and in the livelihoods of their members of working age.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Safety nets help households to manage risk. At a minimum, safety net programs help households that are&#13;
    facing hard times to avoid irreversible losses, allowing them to maintain the household and business&#13;
    assets on which their livelihoods are based and to adequately nourish and school their children. At best,&#13;
    they can provide an insurance element that lets households invest in alternative livelihoods that yield&#13;
    higher earnings. Thus, safety nets not only protect households but also promote their independence.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Safety nets allow governments to make choices that support efficiency and growth . An adequate&#13;
    permanent social assistance system can fulfill whatever redistributive goals the society has, freeing other&#13;
    sectors from the role and allowing them to concentrate on the efficient provision of services. Thus, for&#13;
    example, the energy sector can set its prices for efficiency, and trade policy can focus on growth rather&#13;
    than job protection. Short-term safety net programs can compensate those who are negatively affected by&#13;
    needed reforms.&#13;

&amp;#12;8.      The Government of Swaziland has demonstrated its commitment to safety nets in&#13;
a number of different ways. It has endorsed important international treaties and&#13;
agreements10 and issued a number of local policy statements.11 In combination, these&#13;
documents stipulate that the government, in collaboration with its partners, will provide&#13;
social safety nets to cushion vulnerable individuals and families. The government currently&#13;
allocates approximately 2.2 percent of GDP to safety net programs and has recently&#13;
introduced new programs, including the Old Age Grant and the Orphans and Vulnerable&#13;
Children Education Grants. Given the magnitude of vulnerability in Swaziland, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
scarce fiscal resources, and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s stated commitment to its social safety net, it&#13;
is important to ensure not only that the social safety net is efficient but also that it is&#13;
relevant to the current context in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.      Scope and Methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.      This review focuses on the largest social transfer programs in Swaziland. The&#13;
review includes all publicly funded social safety net programs. These programs were&#13;
identified by our government counterparts and other stakeholders based on the definition&#13;
of social safety net programs as non-contributory programs targeted to poor or otherwise&#13;
vulnerable people. These programs have different objectives, for example, some are&#13;
designed to address chronic poverty or vulnerability while others aim to mitigate short-term&#13;
poverty. Box 2 lists the programs that make up the social safety net.&#13;

10.       The objective of this study is to identify viable ways to make the safety net more&#13;
relevant and efficient through an in-depth analysis of poverty and vulnerability and of the&#13;
efficacy of current safety net programs. The report focuses on publicly financed social&#13;
transfers in Swaziland, including cash and in-kind transfers. This includes programs funded&#13;
by either national or official international aid. Chapter 2 explores the risks faced by the&#13;
Swazis, including but not limited to poverty. Chapter 3 reviews current social net programs&#13;
and expenditures and analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness of social transfers. Chapter 4&#13;
analyzes ways to target safety net programs, and Chapter 5 discusses options to increase&#13;
the relevance and efficiency of the safety net, particularly in light of the recent financial&#13;
crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.       There are a number of limitations to our analysis. Because some programs did not&#13;
supply us with expenditure information, our expenditure analysis should be considered as a&#13;
close approximation but not an exact reflection of total safety net spending. In addition, it&#13;
was beyond the scope of this report to analyze community-based safety net programs,&#13;
active labor market programs (including second chance education and training programs&#13;
targeted to the poor and vulnerable), or social care services. Therefore, the report looks&#13;
only briefly at these important kinds of safety nets, but it does attempt to capture&#13;
expenditures on these programs. Nor does this review cover the range of small programs&#13;
implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and faith-based organizations&#13;
(FBOs). It does, however, include in the expenditure review any subventions from the&#13;
&#13;
                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;government budget given to those NGOs that provide safety net services. Finally, this&#13;
review does not examine contributory social insurance programs, although it recognizes&#13;
that social insurance forms an important part of the social protection system in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.    This report has drawn on data from a variety of sources. The review team held&#13;
individual and group meetings with policymakers, public sector managers, program staff,&#13;
and representatives of international agencies. The team reviewed Government of Swaziland&#13;
Estimates of Expenditure and program-level expenditure information as well as other&#13;
reports, reviews, and secondary data sources. Also, the team analyzed data from the&#13;
Swaziland Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (SHIES) of 2000/01 and 2009/10 and&#13;
secondary data sources for the risk and vulnerability and targeting analyses.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;              CHAPTER II: POVERTY AND VULNERABILITY IN SWAZILAND&#13;
&#13;
13.     In this chapter, we examine poverty and vulnerability in Swaziland. We draw a&#13;
profile of the poor and extreme poor and examine the sources of their vulnerability,&#13;
including food insecurity and shocks, and their movements in and out of poverty. The&#13;
chapter also provides in-depth analysis of vulnerable groups (children, elderly, and those&#13;
with HIV/AIDS). The main data sources for this analysis were the two most recent&#13;
household budget surveys,12 but we also consulted a considerable amount of secondary&#13;
literature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.      Overall Trends in Poverty 2001-2010&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.     The Swaziland Household Income and Expenditure Survey of 2009/10 showed that&#13;
63 percent of the total population was living below the basic needs poverty line, down&#13;
from 69 percent in 2000/01. This translates into a reduction in the number of poor people&#13;
from 678,500 in 2000/01 to 641,000 in 2009/10.13 There was no equivalent drop in extreme&#13;
poverty over the past decade, with about 295,000 Swazis recorded as living below the&#13;
extreme poverty line in 2010 (Table 1).14 Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s inequality of consumption (its Gini&#13;
coefficient is 0.425) is lower than many other African countries, which reflects its more&#13;
homogeneous living standards, but income inequality is higher (0.504).15 The decline in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
   Swazi Household Income and Expenditure Survey (SHIES) for 2000/01 and 2009/10.&#13;
13&#13;
   The poverty line used to calculate these 2009/2010 figures was determined to be E461 per month per adult&#13;
equivalent in constant January 2010 currency, and the extreme poverty line was set at E215 per adult&#13;
equivalent. The methodology is described by the Swazi Central Statistical Office (CSO) in two reports: CSO&#13;
(2011a) and CSO (undated). Poverty was defined based on a cost of basic needs approach, and extreme&#13;
poverty was defined as consumption below the cost of the food portion of the basic needs poverty line.&#13;
14&#13;
   It is important to recognize that these findings are sensitive to where the poverty line is drawn. According&#13;
to the CSO, setting the extreme poverty line at E180 per month per adult equivalent in 2009/2010 would have&#13;
yielded the conclusion that extreme poverty in Swaziland had actually increased over the previous decade (see&#13;
Annex 1).&#13;
15&#13;
   This is the Gini coefficient in 2010 as calculated using per capita consu mption by the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ADePT&#13;
software. The US Central Intelligence Agency reported the Gini coefficient for family income in 2001 as 0.504.&#13;

&amp;#12;level of poverty occurred both in rural areas (from 80 to 73 percent) and in urban areas&#13;
(from 36 to 31 percent).16 A description of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey&#13;
(HIES) methodology is presented in Annex 1 and additional poverty measurements are&#13;
presented in Annex Table 2.3.&#13;

15.     Growth has not benefitted the poorest segments of the population. Swaziland has&#13;
experienced relatively modest growth, but the growth rates in consumption have been&#13;
significantly higher for those in the middle part of the income distribution, whereas the&#13;
bottom 30 percent of the distribution has experienced a further reduction in income (Figure&#13;
2).17&#13;

&amp;#12;16.         The decline in poverty was not equally distributed throughout the country. While&#13;
the poverty headcount in Shiselweni declined by 14 percentage points, there was no real&#13;
change in poverty in Hhohho and Lubombo (Figure 3). Extreme poverty decreased in&#13;
Shiselweni, increased in Hhohho and Lubombo, and remained constant in Manzini (Figure&#13;
4). Poverty by geographic regions is also presented in Annex Table 2.4.&#13;

&amp;#12;17.       A recently completed poverty map demonstrates that the four regions of&#13;
Swaziland are far from homogenous and that three of the four regions have pockets of&#13;
both wealth and extreme poverty. In particular, Shiselwheni is poorer than the other&#13;
regions, but its population lives closer to the poverty line and it has two pockets of relatively&#13;
low poverty. The other three regions have more variation, with very poor districts&#13;
alternating with better-off districts (Figure 5). 18&#13;

&amp;#12;B.      2010 Poverty Profile&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.     The most important feature of poverty in Swaziland other than its pervasiveness is&#13;
its homogeneity in the sense that there is little difference in key poverty indicators. The&#13;
elderly and children are poorer than active-aged adults but not as sharply as in many other&#13;
medium-income countries (Annex Table 2.5). Poverty is lower for households with active-&#13;
aged heads and heads with more education (Annex Tables 2.6 and 2.7). A more notable&#13;
result is the sharply lower than average poverty rate for heads who work in the public&#13;
service (Annex Table 2.8). Headship was about evenly split by gender in the 2010 Swazi&#13;
population, with 50.5 percent of the population living in households with male heads and&#13;
49.5 percent in those headed by females. Female-headed households constitute 53 percent&#13;
of poor households and 56 percent of extremely poor households (Annex Table 2.9).19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     Poverty and extreme poverty in Swaziland are overwhelmingly a rural&#13;
phenomenon. The incidence of poverty is 73 percent in rural areas and 31 percent in urban&#13;
areas, down from 80 percent and 36 percent respectively in 2000/2001 (Figure 6). In 2010,&#13;
extreme poverty was 29 percent, but only 6 percent of urban dwellers were extremely poor&#13;
compared to 33 percent of those in rural areas. Eighty-eight percent of the poor and 95&#13;
percent of the extreme poor live in rural areas. Also, the rural poor are worse off than their&#13;
urban counterparts. In 2010, average consumption among the urban poor was 33 percent&#13;
below the poverty line, but it was 51 percent below the poverty line among the rural poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19&#13;
  The 2009-2010 questionnaire had many more questions than the 2000/2001 questionnaire, so it is possible&#13;
to draw a full profile of the poor and extreme poor from the 2010 data. CSO (2011) made comparisons&#13;
between 2000 and 2010 regarding household assets and access to services such as water, sanitation, and&#13;
electricity for which data were available for both years. The tables presented in Annex 2 are from SHIES 2009-&#13;
2010.&#13;

&#13;
20.     Poverty rates increase as the size of the household increases. The larger the&#13;
household, the more likely it is that the household will be poor. Also, poverty incidence&#13;
among households with six or more members is higher than the national average (Annex&#13;
Table 2.11).20,21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.     The population in Swaziland is very young, and in general, children and the elderly&#13;
are at higher risk of being poor. Nearly half of the Swazi population is under the age of 18.&#13;
Seventy percent of children aged 15 and younger are poor, as are 71 percent of people aged&#13;
60 and older. This is also the pattern for extreme poverty.22 Households with children are&#13;
poorer than households with elderly members, and households with both are even poorer.&#13;
The least poor households have no children and no elderly members (Annex Table 2.10),&#13;
and households with elderly members are poorer (76.7 percent) than households without&#13;
elderly members (56.6 percent poor). This topic is discussed further in Section E of this&#13;
chapter.&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
   The data (SHIES 2009-10) show that poverty increases monotonically until virtually all households with 12 or&#13;
more children are poor.&#13;
21&#13;
   It should be emphasized that only 4 percent of the Swazi population live in households consisting of only&#13;
one member, while fewer than 0.5 percent live in households with 25 members.&#13;
22&#13;
   According to the SHIES, about 485,000 Swazi citizens (about 48 percent of the population) are children aged&#13;
18 or under, while about 60,000 are elderly (about 6 percent of the population). Adults comprise about 46&#13;
percent of the population.&#13;
                                                      14&#13;
&amp;#12;22.        In Swaziland, as in most countries of the world, having more education reduces&#13;
the likelihood of being poor. Households with illiterate heads are 50 percent more likely to&#13;
be poor than those with literate heads, with a poverty rate of 85 percent. Households with&#13;
illiterate heads are twice as likely to be extremely poor, with an extreme poverty rate of&#13;
nearly 50 percent. Also, households headed by someone who completed high school or a&#13;
public or private college or university are much less likely to be poor (Figure 7).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
23.        Not surprisingly, the education levels of poor people are not as high as those of&#13;
their wealthier counterparts. Poor Swazis rarely finish high school (only 9 percent of the&#13;
poor), and hardly any poor people receive any education beyond the secondary level. More&#13;
than one in five extremely poor people are illiterate, compared to just one in twenty among&#13;
those above the poverty line.23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.        Unemployment is high in Swaziland, particularly in rural areas. According to&#13;
preliminary results from the Swaziland Labor Force Survey 2010-11, the total&#13;
unemployment rate in 2010, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO), was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23&#13;
     Literacy was defined as the proportion of those over the age of 15 who were able to read and write.&#13;
                                                       15&#13;
&amp;#12;28.5 percent, with very little regional differentiation.24 Unemployment was higher in rural&#13;
areas (37.1 percent) than in urban (16.7 percent). The average unemployment rate for&#13;
young people (15-24 years of age) was 52 percent compared to 12 percent of people aged&#13;
50 to 54, and female unemployment was higher than male unemployment (31.3 percent&#13;
compared to 25.7 percent).25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.     Unemployment is associated with poverty and extreme poverty status but not as&#13;
strongly as in countries with more widespread formal employment than Swaziland.26&#13;
Household heads who reported they had worked for at least one hour in the previous 30&#13;
days had a lower poverty rate (49.4 percent) than household heads who had done no work&#13;
(77.4 percent). They also had a lower extreme poverty rate (19.2 percent) than household&#13;
heads who had done no work (39 percent extremely poor). These numbers should however&#13;
be treated with caution, since the definition of employment makes a difference in&#13;
interpreting these numbers as it is not clear whether survey respondents understood the&#13;
question to mean any kind of work, even unpaid work or helping out neighbors in exchange&#13;
for future food. Also, agricultural employment is highly seasonal, and some poor people&#13;
may have been surveyed during the off-season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     Being productively employed protects against income poverty, but this is not a&#13;
guarantee. The likelihood of being employed increases with wealth status. However, 36&#13;
percent of men and 29 percent of women in the poorest quintile are employed (Figure 8).&#13;
Again, it is not clear if respondents understood employment in the ILO sense as they may&#13;
have under-reported their economic activity. This is because only slightly more than half of&#13;
all jobs provide earnings throughout the year. In the agricultural sector in particular,&#13;
employment is often seasonal for both men and women, whereas the non-agricultural&#13;
24&#13;
   The preliminary report on the LFS 2010/11 uses two definitions of unemployment, the â&#128;&#156;relax[ed]â&#128;&#157; and the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;strictâ&#128;&#157; where the latter refers to the standard ILO definition.&#13;
25&#13;
   CSO (2012).&#13;
26&#13;
   It should be noted that it is not clear from the SHIES questionnaire what exactly respondents thought was&#13;
meant by the question â&#128;&#156;did you work at least one hour in the past 30 days?â&#128;&#157; as this might have connoted&#13;
â&#128;&#156;work for payâ&#128;&#157; as opposed to work on a household garden plot or â&#128;&#156;work for foodâ&#128;&#157; on a neighborâ&#128;&#153;s plot .&#13;
                                                     16&#13;
&amp;#12;sector is more likely to provide year-round employment. Overall, men are less likely to be&#13;
employed throughout the year (57 percent) than women (75 percent).27&#13;

&#13;
27.         People who live on land with usage rights given by the Chief are poorer than&#13;
average. Nearly three-quarters of all Swazis live on Swazi Nation Land. This land is held in&#13;
trust for the nation by the King and is administered by the chiefs. Most of the people who&#13;
live on Swazi Nation Land farm small plots, cultivating maize, keeping cattle, and&#13;
occasionally producing a cash crop. About 75 percent of people on Swazi National Land are&#13;
poor compared with only 35 percent who have rented or purchased their land. Thirty-six&#13;
percent of people living on Swazi Nation Land are extremely poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.         The majority of Swazi households (83 percent) live in houses with a roof made of&#13;
corrugated iron, and these households have a poverty rate almost equal to the overall&#13;
poverty rate of 63 percent. The main wealth-based difference in roofing material is that&#13;
poorer Swazis without corrugated iron roofs tend to have roofs made of grass and mud&#13;
brick roofs (15 percent of the poor live under such roofs, and their poverty rate is 92&#13;
percent). Wealthier Swazis are more likely to have roofs made of asbestos, tiles, slate, or&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;concrete. Most Swazis (71 percent) live in houses with concrete or plaster walls, with a&#13;
corresponding poverty rate of 53 percent. The 29 percent of Swazis who live in homes made&#13;
of traditional material are much poorer â&#128;&#146; 88 percent are poor compared to the overall&#13;
poverty rate of 63 percent. This pattern persists with extreme poverty, where those whose&#13;
houses have walls made of traditional material have an extreme poverty rate that is more&#13;
than twice as high as those whose walls are made of concrete or plaster.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.     In Swaziland, nearly all urban households (90 percent) have access to safe water&#13;
compared to only 60 percent of rural households (Figure 9).28 Access to water has&#13;
increased for all income groups during the past decade. On the other hand, there has been&#13;
a drop in the standard of sanitation in Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s two most populous regions, Hhohho and&#13;
Manzini, while sanitation conditions have significantly improved in the Shiselweni region&#13;
where the proportion of households using flush toilets more than doubled over the past&#13;
decade. Currently 37.7 percent of the population has to rely on unsafe water sources, and&#13;
four-fifths of these people (81.7 percent) are poor. Also, 16 percent rely on public&#13;
standpipes, 72.8 percent of whom are poor. More than one-third of the population has&#13;
piped water in their homes, but only 28.5 percent of these households are poor, versus the&#13;
overall poverty rate of 63 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28&#13;
 Safe water refers here to water piped into the building, piped water accessible from outside the building, or&#13;
water from a borehole, protected well, or protected spring (CSO, 2011a, p. 22).&#13;

30.      A major issue for the poor and extreme poor who lack piped water is how long it&#13;
takes to get to the water source. Only 6.3 percent of the SHIES sample responded to this&#13;
question, but of these, 13.7 percent had to walk more than an hour to reach their water&#13;
sources, and the poverty rate for these people was around 82 to 85 percent. It appears that&#13;
poorer people were more likely to have responded to this question, since the average&#13;
poverty rate of respondents was 77 percent, which is higher than the overall rate of 63&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.      Sanitation is a problem in Swaziland, particularly for the poor. Approximately 14.7&#13;
percent of the population has no toilet in their home and has to use the bush or the fields.&#13;
Of these, 93 percent are poor and 57 percent are extremely poor. About half of all Swazis&#13;
have an ordinary pit toilet, and of these, 70 percent are poor (versus the overall poverty&#13;
rate of 63 percent). Predictably, it is primarily the non-poor who have flush toilets (15&#13;
percent of the population have flush toilets and only 12.8 percent are poor), and the&#13;
remainder have a ventilated or improved pit toilet (17.3 percent of the population) and&#13;
have basically the same poverty rate as the national average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     19&#13;
&amp;#12;32.         Finally, access to electricity is highly related to householdsâ&#128;&#153; level of income and&#13;
location as two-thirds of urban households have access to electricity compared to only&#13;
one-third of rural households (Figure 10).29 Paraffin and candles are the main light sources&#13;
of the poor in Swaziland, with 20.2 percent of the poor using paraffin and 60 percent of the&#13;
poor using candles. There are evidently some Swazi households that are too poor even for&#13;
paraffin or candles and use only wood fires to light their houses.&#13;

C.          Food Insecurity and Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33.         In Swaziland, the most common adverse events are related to agricultural shocks&#13;
such as reoccurring droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, prolonged dry spells, and high&#13;
temperatures. Drought was cited by more than 80 percent of the SHIES respondents as the&#13;
major shock that they experienced in 2008. The high costs of agricultural inputs and high&#13;
food prices â&#128;&#147; both of which are closely related to drought â&#128;&#147; were cited as other shocks with&#13;
which households had to find ways to cope to sustain their livelihood levels.30&#13;

&amp;#12;34.     Swaziland is not self-sufficient in food production, but thanks to a recent slight&#13;
increase in agricultural production, levels of food insecurity seem to have decreased.&#13;
Smallholders occupy 75 percent of the land under cultivation, but their production accounts&#13;
for only 10 percent of total agricultural output. The country relies on food imports and food&#13;
aid to cover the needs of the population, and despite the slight decrease in food insecurity,&#13;
161,000 people were still estimated to be food-insecure in 2009/10 (Figure 11). It is also&#13;
worth mentioning that food insecurity is regional; for example, the Lubombo region has&#13;
twice as many food-insecure people as Manzini. A fluctuating supply of food led to rapid&#13;
hikes in food prices (especially in 2008), which put pressure on household spending.31&#13;
However, food prices declined sharply between 2008 and 2010.32 In the 2009/10 season,&#13;
the rains started on time and were adequate throughout the season, thus allowing the&#13;
timely planting of crops. However, the dry spell in late December and early January had a&#13;
negative effect on crops. The implications for the 2010/11 consumption period of this&#13;
weather on early crops were expected to be minimal, whereas crops planted later were&#13;
expected to be compromised due to dry spells, heat waves, and sporadic localized&#13;
flooding.33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.     Both poverty and low agricultural productivity are widespread, with noticeable&#13;
fluctuations at the district level. A visual comparison of the poverty map (CSO, 2011b) and&#13;
the VAC surveys (of 2009 and 2010) suggest that low agricultural productivity is related to&#13;
poverty, which may be empirically determined in future research. The average harvest of a&#13;
poor household was 64 units of maize, whereas non-poor households produced 99.5 units.&#13;
Extremely poor households produced less maize (52 units) than households that were not&#13;
extremely poor (85.9 units). Households living on Swazi Nation Land (75 percent of whom&#13;
are poor) are less productive than commercial producers who produce on title deed land. A&#13;

&amp;#12;worrying trend is that smallholder farm productivity and production have been declining&#13;
over time.34&#13;

36.        Food insecurity adversely affects nutritional status and yields poor nutritional&#13;
outcomes. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey report produced in 2010 by the Swazi&#13;
Central Statistical Office in partnership with UNICEF35 estimated that 6 percent of children&#13;
under the age of 5 in Swaziland are underweight. Thirty-one percent of children are stunted&#13;
or too short for their age, and 3 percent are wasted or too thin for their height (Table 2).&#13;
Children in the Shiselweni region are more likely to be underweight and stunted than other&#13;
children.&#13;

D.     Shocks and Responses&#13;
37.    Almost every household in the SHIES sample (95 percent) reported that they had&#13;
experienced at least one of the shocks that were listed in the survey. The poor comprised&#13;
64 percent of those who reported experiencing a shock, while the extreme poor comprised&#13;
30 percent. The major shocks experienced by the poor and extreme poor are reported in&#13;

Note: The poverty and extreme poverty rates pertain only to respondents. Respondents were allowed to&#13;
name one, two, or three shocks, so poverty rates do not exactly match population total rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    23&#13;
&amp;#12;38.     Twenty-eight percent of the population identified food price increases as one of&#13;
the three major shocks faced by their household.36 The SHIES 2009-2010 was conducted&#13;
after food and fuel prices rose sharply in 2008, so this finding is not surprising. Interestingly,&#13;
only 24 percent of the poor identified food price increases as one of the three major shocks,&#13;
and of those who reported experiencing this kind of shock, only 59 percent were poor (as&#13;
opposed to a total of 68.8 percent poor among all respondents). This suggests that food&#13;
price increases were more of a problem for non-poor households. This makes sense in that&#13;
poor households consume more from their own production than from purchased sources,&#13;
although this varies by livelihood and region. Fifteen percent of respondents reported&#13;
experiencing drought or flood, and 80 percent of those who reported this as a major shock&#13;
were poor people (17 percent). The third most frequently reported shock was agricultural&#13;
input price increases, reported by about 12 percent of respondents and 13 percent of the&#13;
poor. This was related to the rise in food and fuel prices in 2008, which caused widespread&#13;
difficulties. The fourth shock was the idiosyncratic risk of chronic or severe illness in the&#13;
household, with 7.2 percent of all respondents reporting having experienced the chronic or&#13;
severe illness of a household member, but only 6.9 percent of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
39.     Respondents named help from family members as their top strategy for coping&#13;
with drought/flood, chronic/severe illness, or the death of the head or a working&#13;
member. This fact suggests that some kinds of shocks mobilize family support and that&#13;
extended family members are willing to draw down their savings to help the afflicted&#13;
household. The one coping strategy that was reported in the case of all seven shocks was&#13;
â&#128;&#156;started to save cashâ&#128;&#157; although the extent of this varied depending on the shock.&#13;
Respondents resorted to reducing their food consumption only if they reported one or both&#13;
of the two price shocks but markedly more in response to the food price shock than the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
  Because respondents were allowed to name one, two, or three shocks, there is some double-counting in the&#13;
reported population figures. The shares here are therefore proportions of the total number of responses&#13;
rather than of the whole population of 1 million people.&#13;
                                                   24&#13;
&amp;#12;agricultural input price shock. Fortunately, only 1.4 percent of the population reported&#13;
having used this negative coping strategy, of whom 83 percent were poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.      Vulnerable Groups&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.     A number of specific groups are especially vulnerable, including children, orphans,&#13;
and children made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS and the elderly. These groups are examined in&#13;
this section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Children who are Poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.     Children are a major correlate of poverty. Household poverty rates increase with&#13;
each additional child under the age of 18. According to SHIES 2009/10, 67.1 percent of&#13;
households with children under the age of 18 are poor compared to only 28.8 percent of&#13;
households with no children under the age of 18 (Annex Table 2.11). Poverty is even more&#13;
strongly correlated with the presence of young children in the household, reaching up to 87&#13;
percent of households that contain five or more children (Table 4). Children are over-&#13;
represented in the bottom consumption deciles and under-represented in the upper deciles&#13;
(Annex Table 3.1); there are proportionately more children who are poor than who are not&#13;
poor.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;42.        The nutritional status of children and their poverty status are correlated. Children&#13;
from households that are poor are much more likely to be malnourished than their&#13;
wealthier counterparts (Figure 12).37 Improving the nutritional status of children should be&#13;
an important safety net objective.&#13;

43.        Education and poverty status are also correlated, especially at the secondary level.&#13;
Eighty-one percent of children in the poorest quintile (in contrast to 87 percent in the&#13;
wealthiest quintile) are enrolled in primary school. Net secondary school enrollment rates&#13;
are low for all wealth groups, partly as a result of children of secondary school age still&#13;
attending primary school and partly as a result of dropouts. However, 56 percent of children&#13;
in the wealthiest quintile are enrolled in secondary school as compared to fewer than 26&#13;
percent of children in the poorest quintile (Figure 13).&#13;

44.     Cost was the primary reason for children not attending school, irrespective of the&#13;
wealth status of the survey respondents. Fewer than 2 percent of respondents (in all&#13;
poverty classifications) reported having to work as being the primary reason why their&#13;
children did not attend school, and almost no respondents indicated that the distance of&#13;
the school from the home was a primary obstacle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Orphans and Children Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45.     Twenty-three percent of children under the age of 18 are orphaned (one or both&#13;
parents are dead), and 4 percent are double orphans. According to the SHIES, the number&#13;
of orphans in Swaziland in 2010 was 123,000, of whom 25,000 were double orphans.38 The&#13;
National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (2006-2010) estimated that for&#13;
every two orphans one other child is made vulnerable due to HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of&#13;
orphanhood increases with age, with 7 percent of children under the age of 5 being orphans&#13;
compared to 37 percent of 15 to 17 year olds. Many children do not live with their parents&#13;
even if the parents are alive. According to the Swaziland Demographic and Health Survey&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38&#13;
  Using the SHIES population basis of 1,017,406 people, we estimate that there are 26,874 maternal orphans&#13;
(2.64 percent of the population), 71,251 paternal orphans (7.03 percent of the population), and 24,524 double&#13;
orphans (2.41 percent of the population). Our estimates are based on population sampling weights.&#13;
                                                       27&#13;
&amp;#12;(DHS) of 2008, 78 percent of children under the age of 18 were not living with both parents,&#13;
and 34 percent were not living with either parent. This phenomenon is more common in&#13;
rural areas than in urban areas (36 percent versus 24 percent.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46.    Poverty and extreme poverty rates for (single) orphans are slightly higher than for&#13;
other children. The poverty rate for single orphans (one parent dead) is 75 percent and 65&#13;
percent for double orphans. Maternal orphans seem to be slightly poorer (80 percent) than&#13;
paternal orphans (76.3 percent) as can be seen in Figure 14. A similar pattern is true for&#13;
extreme poverty, with 36 percent of single orphans and 26 percent of double orphans being&#13;
extremely poor compared to the average of 34.1 percent for all children (Annex Table 3.2).&#13;
The lower poverty rates for double orphans than for single orphans suggest that double&#13;
orphans are living in slightly better-off households, as was found by Beegle et al (2010) to&#13;
be the case in other Sub-Saharan African countries.&#13;

47.    Orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) are mostly cared for by their extended&#13;
families and are often depend on community assistance to survive, but this assistance is&#13;
not readily available to the majority of OVCs. According to the 2008 DHS, only 41 percent&#13;
of OVCs received any external assistance (Figure 15). The most common form of support&#13;
was school assistance, which was received by one-third of OVCs, while considerably fewer&#13;
received other material assistance (8 percent) or emotional support (5 percent).&#13;

48.         A particularly vulnerable group among OVCs is child-headed households (CHH), but&#13;
this group accounts for less than 1 percent of all Swazi households. A recent study by Save&#13;
the Children and UNICEF investigated the situation of child-headed households in drought-&#13;
prone areas of Swaziland and provides insights into the situation of these children (see Box&#13;
3).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;                                      Box 3: Child-Headed Households&#13;
&#13;
Children in child-headed households (CHH) are typically orphans, but this is not true for all CHH. Seventy-five&#13;
percent of CHH are double orphans, but 35 percent of child-headed households have at least one parent alive&#13;
who has abandoned the children. The most common reason the children gave for why mothers left them was&#13;
her remarriage while more than half of the children did not know the reason why their father had left.&#13;
&#13;
Almost 90 percent of the CHH had an extended family, but â&#128;&#156;poor relationshipâ&#128;&#157; was given as the main reason&#13;
why the children were not living with their extended family. In addition, more than 20 percent of respondents&#13;
suggested that fear of losing their property was another important reason for not living with relatives. More&#13;
than 20 percent of CHH had experienced loss of property since their parents had passed away, with most&#13;
having been taken by the community and neighbors or paternal relatives.&#13;
&#13;
CHH live in deprived situations. They consume a carbohydrate-intense diet that lacks nutrients like fats and&#13;
proteins that are essential to development. More than 55 percent of CHHs lack access to safe water, 37&#13;
percent lack access to proper sanitation, and only 6 percent have electricity in their homes.&#13;
&#13;
Ninety percent of CHHs had received at least one form of external support in the previous six months. The&#13;
government was the largest source of external support (69 percent), followed by NGOs at 41 percent, and&#13;
friends and neighbors at 36 percent.&#13;

People with HIV/AIDS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
49.      Swaziland has the highest HIV prevalence in the world with 26 percent of all adults&#13;
between the ages of 15 and 49 being infected. Infection is more prevalent among women&#13;
(31 percent) than men (20 percent). An estimated 7,000 Swazis die each year from AIDS-&#13;
related illnesses, and over half of all hospital admissions are for people living with&#13;
HIV/AIDS.39 HIV prevalence is higher in urban areas (31 percent) than in rural areas (24&#13;
percent) for people aged 15 to 49. It is not directly related to income, as the infection rates&#13;
are largely the same for all income quintiles (varying from 26.4 percent in the lowest to 25.1&#13;
percent in the highest quintile).40 However, HIV interacts with other aspects of poverty as&#13;
the poor are often diagnosed late, are less likely to get treatment for sexually transmitted&#13;
diseases, and are less likely to use condoms.41 HIV/AIDS has resulted in large increases in&#13;

&amp;#12;the numbers of single-parent families, grandparent-headed families, and child-headed&#13;
families. The cost of providing treatment for HIV/AIDS patients drains the countryâ&#128;&#153;s already&#13;
scarce resources. The economic consequences of the pandemic, including declines in&#13;
productivity and output and the loss of many skilled workers, have also been substantial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50.        The social and economic impact of the pandemic will continue to grow, albeit at a&#13;
diminishing rate. Progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS is reflected in the reduction in the&#13;
number of new infections, which declined from 20,000 in 2000 to 12,281 in 2009 with a&#13;
further reduction to 11,381 by 2015 being projected. However, the number of Swazis living&#13;
with HIV in 2010 was 191,147, and this is projected to increase to 214,210 by 2015 (Figure&#13;
16). AIDS-related deaths are projected to increase from 7,114 to 8,389 during the same&#13;
period.42 Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased dramatically and the&#13;
number of people accessing care is projected to grow (Box 4).&#13;

&amp;#12;                                 Box 4: Access to Antiretroviral Therapy&#13;
&#13;
The provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the public sector began in December 2003. The&#13;
number of people receiving ART rose from about 6,000 people at the end of 2004 (out of an estimated&#13;
45,000 in need of treatment) to 72,000 (out of an estimated 185,800 who need ed treatment). By 2015,&#13;
an estimated 110,605 Swazis will be in need of treatment out of an infected population of 214,210 (including&#13;
both children and adults). The Government of Swaziland envisages that the coverage of ART will reach 85 percent&#13;
of adults in need and 90 percent of children in need by 2014.&#13;

51.        The vulnerability of women to HIV is exacerbated by customs that leave women&#13;
unable to protect themselves. Under customary law, when women get married, their legal&#13;
status becomes comparable to that of a minor, and there are severe limitations on the&#13;
freedom of women to own property, access finance, and make life choices. As polygamy is&#13;
still common and protection against sexual assault and physical violence against women is&#13;
weak, many women are unable to protect themselves against infection.43 Poverty and food&#13;
insecurity has also driven many poor women to exchange sex for food or money, which&#13;
increases their risk of becoming infected with HIV.44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           The Elderly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52.        The elderly (people aged 60 years and over) comprise only 6 percent of the Swazi&#13;
population but are more likely to be poor than households with no elderly members.&#13;
Households with one elderly member are more likely to be poor (77 percent) than the&#13;
average for the population (63 percent), but only 66 percent of households with two elderly&#13;
people are poor. About 32 percent of the population lives in households with one or more&#13;
elderly members. Households with elderly members are more prevalent in rural areas (87&#13;
percent), which is also where the majority of the poor reside. Of the poor elderly, 95&#13;
percent live in rural areas. Of the non-poor elderly, 68 percent live in rural areas.&#13;

&amp;#12;53.     The elderly are socially vulnerable, particularly because of the loss of their children&#13;
and extended families to death or to urban and foreign migration. As a result, the social&#13;
isolation of the elderly is increasing, and elderly people commonly report that they are&#13;
lonely. A study of the elderly in 2003 found that about 46 percent of them received some&#13;
form of care and support from either family or neighbors but that 85 percent were&#13;
responsible for the care of others. About 11 percent of the elderly were employed and 34&#13;
percent were active in subsistence farming. Over three-quarters of the elderly reported that&#13;
their health was poor. Abuse of the elderly by their children was also reported. 45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F.      Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54.     Despite a decline in overall poverty rates in Swaziland, extreme poverty remains&#13;
the same, growth has not been pro-poor, and poverty remains significantly higher in rural&#13;
areas than in urban areas. Sixty-three percent of the population remains poor and 29&#13;
percent remains extremely poor. In addition, the recent modest economic growth has not&#13;
benefitted the poorest people in the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
55.     There are only two major correlates of poverty â&#128;&#146; rural location and the presence of&#13;
dependents (not necessarily orphans) in the household. Rural Swazis are significantly more&#13;
likely to be poor than their urban counterparts, and poverty is deeper in rural areas than in&#13;
urban areas. While there are differences between the four regions, most of the differences&#13;
in poverty are evident between the 195 districts in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56.     Households with children and elderly members are poorer than the average&#13;
household, and nearly half of the population is under the age of 18. Households with no&#13;
elderly members or children constitute only 9 percent of the population, but they are much&#13;
less poor (only 25 percent) than households that include both elderly members and children&#13;

&amp;#12;(78 percent poor). The number of children under the age of 18 in the household is strongly&#13;
correlated with poverty as poverty rates increase from 45 percent for one-child households&#13;
to 90 to 100 percent for households with eight or more children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
57.    Children and the elderly are more likely than working age adults to be poor.&#13;
Poverty is lowest for adults aged 45 to 49 (54 percent), while poverty rates for children&#13;
under the age of 5 and the elderly aged 60 and above are 71 percent and 70 percent&#13;
respectively. Although only about one-tenth of the population live in households with a&#13;
head aged 35 to 39, only about one-half of such households are poor. Almost one-third of&#13;
people live in households with heads aged 60 and above, and people in these households&#13;
are poorer (76 to 77 percent) than the overall poverty rate of 63 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58.    Poverty is associated with a lack of education in Swaziland. Illiterate household&#13;
heads are 50 percent more likely to be poor than literate heads, and the poverty rate falls&#13;
from 84 percent of households whose heads who have less than a primary education to 7&#13;
percent for households whose heads have a public college education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59.    Housing characteristics are somewhat correlated with poverty. Swazis living on&#13;
land with usage rights granted by their Chiefs are poorer than other Swazis. Extremely poor&#13;
Swazis are more likely to live in homes made of traditional materials with grass and mud&#13;
brick roofs and to lack access to safe water, toilets, and electricity. However, housing&#13;
correlates like a lack of access to electricity, water, and sanitation primarily reflect their&#13;
location in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.    The most common shocks reported by poor households were food price increases&#13;
and drought/flood. Over 20 percent of the poor and of the extreme poor reported food&#13;
price increases as being the major shock that they had experienced in the previous year,&#13;
while drought/flood was reported by just under 20 percent of both the poor and the&#13;
extreme poor.&#13;

&amp;#12;               CHAPTER III: THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET IN SWAZILAND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
61.    This chapter reviews the existing safety net programs in Swaziland, including their&#13;
expenditures and implementation constraints. This report focuses on social transfers,&#13;
including cash and in-kind transfers. Table 5 lists the main social transfer programs that are&#13;
discussed in this chapter. Thereafter, public expenditures on the social safety net,&#13;
particularly social transfers, are analyzed as well as the impact of the fiscal crisis on the&#13;
safety net. The chapter concludes with an examination of several administrative and&#13;
implementation issues that apply to all safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     The Organization of the Social Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62.    The safety net system consists of multiple cash and in-kind transfers, social care&#13;
services, active labor market programs, and community-based programs implemented by&#13;
at least five ministries or departments within ministries. Agencies delivering safety net&#13;
services include the Department of Social Welfare (DSW) within the Deputy Prime&#13;
Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office (DPM), the National Emergency Response Council on HIV and AIDS&#13;
(NERCHA), the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), the Ministry of Health (MOH),&#13;
and the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) in the DPM â&#128;&#153;s Office. The DSW,&#13;
which was formerly in the Ministry of Health but has been housed in the DPMâ&#128;&#153;s Office since&#13;
2009, is responsible for Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s largest cash transfer programs and is also responsible&#13;
for overseeing social care services. The DPM also has portfolio responsibility for the NDMA,&#13;
the agency responsible for government-funded food distribution. NERCHA is responsible for&#13;
the distribution of donor-funded food to schools for the school feeding program and to&#13;
communities for the Neighborhood Care Points (NCPs), for social care services in the NCPs,&#13;
and for Young Heroes, a small cash grant program. MOET implements the School Feeding&#13;
Program with assistance from NERCHA and also has the responsibility for overseeing non-&#13;
formal labor market programs. The MOH is responsible for administering fee waivers for&#13;
&#13;
                                                35&#13;
&amp;#12;health care and the Phalala Fund to cover any medical care not available in Swaziland and&#13;
also implements a food by prescription program for malnourished beneficiaries of ART, TB,&#13;
and prevention of mother to child transmission programs. Other agencies, such as the&#13;
Micro-Projects Program and the Ministry of Labor, implement other safety net programs.&#13;
The DPM has some responsibility for coordinating the safety net but lacks a broad mandate&#13;
for sector-wide coordination.&#13;

           Old Age Grants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64.        The Old Age Grant (OAG) was introduced by the government in 2005 with the&#13;
objective of protecting the elderly. As noted by King Mswati III in his 2005 Throne Speech&#13;
that launched the Old Age Grant, the need for protection largely arose as a consequence of&#13;
HIV/AIDS. Elderly people were losing their younger income-earning family members to the&#13;
disease and had to shoulder the burden of providing and caring for their grandchildren. The&#13;
OAG is administered by the DSW and is financed by the government. The direct cost of the&#13;
grant is estimated to have been E100.3 million (US$14.1 million) in FY2010/2011. OAG&#13;
transfers account for almost 90 percent of all cash transfers to households. Between 2005&#13;
and 2010/11, the number of beneficiaries increased by 27 percent from about 43,900 to&#13;
almost 55,700 in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65.        In theory, OAG beneficiaries are not eligible if they receive an employment&#13;
pension of more than E1,000 per month, but this rule has not been enforced so the OAG&#13;
essentially operates as a universal social pension. All elderly citizens aged 60 and over are&#13;
eligible as long as they have a national identification card. The number of beneficiaries&#13;
increased from 43,830 in 2005 to 55,692 in 2011/12. About 91 percent of the population&#13;
aged 60 years and over receive the OAG.46 The current value of the Old Age Grant is E200&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46&#13;
     Based on the authorsâ&#128;&#153; population estimates using data from the 2010 SHIES.&#13;
                                                       39&#13;
&amp;#12;(US$26) per month or 43 percent of the adult equivalent poverty line and 93 percent of the&#13;
adult equivalent food poverty line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
66.        Qualitative evidence suggests that the OAG has had a positive impact on&#13;
beneficiaries lives by increasing their food security as a result of more frequent and better&#13;
meals and the ability to purchase more food and to buy it in bulk. In addition to the direct&#13;
beneficiaries of the grant, other household members also benefitted significantly,&#13;
particularly with regard to their nutritional status, education, and health care. Nearly 70&#13;
percent of OAG recipients spent more on groceries than before receiving benefits and 63&#13;
percent spent more on protein, while 71 percent reported that they were â&#128;&#156;more able to&#13;
afford health care.â&#128;&#157; Seventy-four percent of children in beneficiary households were&#13;
enrolled in school, and the OAG was used to pay their fees.47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
67.        The age of eligibility for the OAG is lower than that in similar programs in many&#13;
other countries. The minimum age to be eligible for the OAG is 60, which is younger than in&#13;
the 20 countries studied in a recent report.48 Moreover, only one-third of these countries&#13;
offered a universal pension (Table 6).&#13;

68.    The OAG is not sufficiently pro-poor â&#128;&#147; although it does not contribute much to the&#13;
welfare of non-poor households, a significant share of OAG resources goes to these&#13;
households. About 28 percent of OAG beneficiaries are not poor and over 11 percent of&#13;
beneficiaries are from the two wealthiest deciles (Table 7). As can be seen in Table 7, the&#13;
OAG is somewhat progressive, with a smaller share of benefits going to households in the&#13;
wealthier deciles than to households in the poorer deciles. However, on average, the OAG&#13;
accounts for 55 percent of the consumption of households in the poorest decile but only 1&#13;
percent of the consumption of households in the wealthiest decile (Table 8). We used SHIES&#13;
data to estimate poverty rates if the OAG did not exist and found that the poverty rate&#13;
would increase only slightly from 63 percent to 64 percent and that the extreme poverty&#13;
rate would increase from 29 percent to 32 percent.&#13;

69.      The OAG is intended to help grandparents to shoulder the burden of caring for&#13;
orphans. However, the logic of providing grants to all elderly people with the intention of&#13;
helping the elderly who care for orphans is questionable. Eighty-three percent of the elderly&#13;
do not live with an orphan, and about 55 percent of orphans do not live with an elderly&#13;
person.49 Moreover, the OAG discriminates against any elderly people caring for many&#13;
orphans since the benefit is not differentiated between an elderly person living alone and&#13;
one caring for several dependents. Among households that contain orphans, the average&#13;
number of orphans is two, and about 7 percent of households caring for orphans consisted&#13;
of six or more orphans.50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70.      The OAG is supposed to be disbursed quarterly, but in reality it is subject to the&#13;
availability of funds and recipients are not always sure when they will actually receive the&#13;

&amp;#12;benefit. Late disbursements make it difficult for recipients to plan, especially at crucial&#13;
times in the year when they could use some of the cash for productive purposes, for&#13;
example, at the start of the planting season in rural areas. In fact, social workers have&#13;
identified cutting back on planting as the main strategy used by the poor to cope with the&#13;
recent series of late payments of the OAG grant. In addition, the value of the benefit has&#13;
only rarely been increased. Although the benefits are higher in real terms than when the&#13;
program began in 2005, they have not been increased since 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
71.    The resource requirements for the OAG program have increased since the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s inception and will continue to increase due to the increasing number of elderly&#13;
Swazis. The over-60 age cohort is expected to grow by almost 30 percent (or about 18,000&#13;
people) by 2020 and will continue to grow after that. This will put increasing pressure on&#13;
already scarce resources. During the same period, the working age population (who will&#13;
need to finance the OAG) is projected to increase by only 18 percent. The grant is disbursed&#13;
quarterly to those beneficiaries who are paid in cash and monthly to those beneficiaries&#13;
who receive their grant via direct deposit into their bank accounts. The quarterly cash&#13;
payments, which account for over 80 percent of payments, are disbursed through local&#13;
government (Tinkhundla) offices and social welfare offices by DSW staffs, who are&#13;
accompanied by police for security reasons.&#13;

       Other DSW Grants&#13;

&#13;
72.    Public Assistance, which has been in operation for over 30 years, was one of&#13;
Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s earliest efforts to establish a formal social safety net. Public Assistance targets&#13;
people under the age of 60 who are both disabled and destitute who are not beneficiaries&#13;
of any other grant and have no other source of income. The grant is administered by the&#13;
DSW. The government finances the program, with the direct costs of the grants estimated&#13;
to have been E4.6 million (US$0.6 million) in FY2010/2011. Candidates apply for assistance&#13;
at one of the four regional social welfare offices. Their eligibility is established by a means&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;test plus a determination of disability. The means test includes a home visit by a social&#13;
welfare officer to assess the applicantâ&#128;&#153;s need, income, and health. There were 5,075&#13;
beneficiaries in December 2011, equivalent to about 15 percent of the severely disabled51&#13;
and a mere 0.5 percent of the poor. The value of the Public Assistance Grant is E80 (US$10)&#13;
per month or 17 percent of the adult equivalent poverty line and 37 percent of the food&#13;
poverty line. The grant is paid in cash and is disbursed quarterly at the same time that OAG&#13;
benefits are paid. Beneficiaries can benefit for an indefinite period as there is no clear exit&#13;
strategy and, thus, there has been little change in caseloads over time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
73.        Military Pensions are non-contributory entitlements awarded to World War II&#13;
veterans or their widows. The program is administered by the DSW and provides E600&#13;
(US$78) to veterans and E300 (US$39) to widows. The government finances the program,&#13;
with the direct costs of the grants estimated to have been E2.9 million (US$0.4 million) in&#13;
FY2010/2011. There were 46 veterans and 464 widows collecting this benefit as of&#13;
December 2011. Benefits are paid monthly via checks collected at the regional offices of the&#13;
DSW. In cases where a deceased veteran had more than one wife, the senior wife receives&#13;
the benefit. When she dies, the next senior wife becomes beneficiary. Rights to the benefit&#13;
pass from widow to widow until all of the widows have died. Beneficiaries may also collect&#13;
an Old Age Grant and/or earn income. The DSW reports that the number of beneficiaries&#13;
has declined and predicts that, based on the age of remaining beneficiaries, the program&#13;
will expire in approximately 10 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
74.        The DSW provides small Grants for People with Disabilities to be used to purchase&#13;
either prostheses or equipment to promote self-employment. Eligibility for these benefits is&#13;
subject to DSW discretion, and there are no established criteria. The DSW also used to&#13;
operate a grant program for Fire Victims, but this program has since been suspended.&#13;
Finally, the DSW used to pay Child Welfare Grants to households that were fostering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
51&#13;
     Estimated at 2 percent of the population.&#13;
                                                 44&#13;
&amp;#12;children, but this program was suspended upon the introduction of the OVC Education&#13;
Grant. Estimated expenditures on these programs in FY2010/2011 were around E1.0 million&#13;
(US$0.1 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
75.      The coverage of these small DSW grant programs is very limited and there are&#13;
large differences between programs in the size of the benefits provided. Even when it was&#13;
operating, the indigent category of Public Assistance served fewer than 1,000 beneficiaries,&#13;
which is not even 1 percent of the extreme poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
76.      The DSW cash transfer programs provide benefits that are broadly comparable&#13;
with those in other countries. In a study of cash transfer programs in middle-income&#13;
countries, the median value of social pension benefits as a share of the consumption of&#13;
recipient households was 20 percent.52 The OAG accounts for 17 percent of the&#13;
consumption of all recipient households and 26 percent of consumption of poor recipient&#13;
households. The benefit provided to disabled Public Assistance beneficiaries represents 37&#13;
percent of the extreme poverty line and is comparable with targeted programs&#13;
internationally (Table 9). A study of cash transfer programs in middle-income countries in&#13;
Europe, Central Asia, and Latin America found that the median value of benefits as a share&#13;
of the consumption of recipient households53 is 13 percent for family allowances and 15&#13;
percent for means-tested programs,54 while the median value of benefits for seven&#13;
conditional cash transfer programs was 13 percent.55 In addition, the value of the benefit is&#13;
uniform across households and does not take household size into account. Flat rates are not&#13;
equitable in that the value of the benefit is relatively smaller for larger households than for&#13;
smaller households.&#13;
&#13;

   This is a slightly different measure than the percentage of the poverty line reported above, but data on the&#13;
consumption of recipient households was not available. Nevertheless, the poverty and extreme poverty lines&#13;
provide a proxy for consumption among the poor and indigent.&#13;

&#13;
77.        At the same time, benefits vary widely between programs, and benefit increases&#13;
are awarded in an ad hoc manner. There is no systematic mechanism that triggers benefit&#13;
increases and price inflation has eroded the value of cash transfers. The OAG was last&#13;
increased in 2009, and the Public Assistance benefit has not been increased in more than a&#13;
decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
78.        It is also worth mentioning that the government is in the process of designing a&#13;
pilot cash transfer program for OVCs. This pilot will be implemented by the Deputy Prime&#13;
Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office and is co-financed by the World Bank and the EU. The pilot is expected to&#13;
reach roughly 8,000 households that contain OVCs.56 The design features of the pilot,&#13;
including the definition of OVCs and the level of benefit, will be developed during 2012, and&#13;
payments will not commence until the design features have been finalized, the systems&#13;
have been put in place (including an MIS and a payment system), and the staff have been&#13;
trained in targeting and enrollment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  The number of households that the pilot will be able to reach will depend on several factors, including the&#13;
level of benefit and the pace of the expansion of the pilot.&#13;
                                                      46&#13;
&amp;#12;79.    Young Heroes is a cash grant program targeted to orphans and administered by a&#13;
secretariat within NERCHA. A Board of Directors guides and oversees the work of the&#13;
secretariat. In FY2010/11, total program costs were E4.0 million (US$0.6 million), with 58&#13;
percent of expenditures covered by NERCHA and 41 percent by donations from local and&#13;
international donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
80.    Community members are responsible for identifying beneficiaries. Young Heroes&#13;
staff visit applicants in their homes to verify their need, taking into account their living&#13;
conditions, the numbers of elderly people and working adults in the home, and any sources&#13;
of income. As of December 2011, the program had 887 beneficiaries in 497 households. The&#13;
grants are E180 (US$23) per month or 39 percent of the adult equivalent poverty line and&#13;
84 percent of the adult equivalent food poverty line. Benefits are paid semi-annually&#13;
through Post Offices. Monitoring officers visit schools once per year to verify that the&#13;
children are enrolled and to ensure that they are not getting assistance from other sources.&#13;
In addition to providing cash grants, Young Heroes pays the school fees of some of its&#13;
beneficiaries and also runs HIV testing and care programs for the children and week-long&#13;
camps for HIV-positive children twice per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
81.    The Young Heroes Program faces a number of implementation challenges,&#13;
including significant diseconomies of scale and the high costs involved in administering&#13;
donor funds. The program is so small that it cannot realize any economies of scale. In&#13;
addition, the reporting requirements related to raising contributions from donors in the&#13;
United States are significant. Except for some effort to exclude the beneficiaries of the OVC&#13;
Education Grants from receiving education assistance provided by Young Heroes, Young&#13;
Heroes operates in virtual isolation from DSW programs. Monitoring enrollment once per&#13;
year does not necessarily mean that a child will attend school regularly. The program has&#13;
not been evaluated and there is no information on whether Young Heroes reaches the&#13;
poorest orphans and with what impact.&#13;
&#13;

          OVC Education Grant Scheme&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
82.       The Education Grant Scheme for OVCs (also known as the Bursary Scheme or the&#13;
Capitation Grant Scheme) is targeted to orphans and vulnerable children to enable them to&#13;
access education. It was introduced by the government with support from UNICEF in 2003.&#13;
The grant is administered by the DSW. The Education Grant Scheme complements other&#13;
government funding to schools and is intended to offset the fees charged to students.&#13;
Bursaries are paid in the name of an individual child, with the beneficiaries selected by a&#13;
committee comprised of school and community representatives. The government finances&#13;
orphans in primary schools and all students in high schools, while the EU finances&#13;
vulnerable children in primary schools. A small number of students are supported by other&#13;
organizations including Young Heroes, the Manzini Youth Center, and World Vision (Table&#13;
10). The EU contribution was estimated to have been E24.0 million (US$3.4 million) in&#13;
FY2010/2011 with government expenditures on the program estimated at E215.8 million&#13;
(US$30.8 million), including spending under the DSW OVC Education Grant and MOET&#13;
(Primary and Secondary Bursaries) line items.57&#13;

  It should however be noted that the EU will soon be changing how it supports education in Swaziland. It will&#13;
be funding a fully supply-side intervention in which it will give grants to the MOET to help schools to improve&#13;
the quality of primary education.&#13;

83.       The value of the bursaries ranges from E560 per year for primary students to E2,500&#13;
per year for Form IV students. The bursary covers approximately 65 percent of average&#13;
primary school fees and somewhat less than 30 percent of average secondary school fees.58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
84.       Although the cost of education is the main reason why Swazi children do not&#13;
attend school, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s education grants reach only a small share of poor&#13;
children while benefitting a significant share of the non-poor. Education assistance&#13;
programs, of which the OVC Education Grants and EU Capitation Grants account for about&#13;
98 percent, reach only about 40 percent of school-age children in the poorest quintile and&#13;
about 36 percent in the second and third quintiles. Yet at the same time, about 18 percent&#13;
of students in the wealthiest quintile receive education support (Figure 17).&#13;

85.       The OVC Education Grant covers only part of the official school fees and covers&#13;
none of the other out-of-pocket costs of education, such as transportation, uniforms, and&#13;
books for secondary students. Yet these out-of-pocket costs often make attending school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58&#13;
  Primary school fees range between E800 and E1,000. Secondary school fees range between E6,000 and&#13;
E10,000.&#13;
                                                  49&#13;
&amp;#12;unaffordable for poor students. It is important to note that the government has introduced&#13;
initiatives that have reduced other costs that can prevent poor children from accessing&#13;
primary education, including the introduction of free primary education (FPE) (which is&#13;
being phased in gradually and will reach universal coverage by 2015) and free books and&#13;
stationery. However, secondary school students have not benefitted from any of these&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
86.        The OVC program faces significant operational challenges, including the difficulty&#13;
of keeping track of individual students and inadequate monitoring of the program. The&#13;
lack of identification numbers for students has led to double counting of students and the&#13;
presence of â&#128;&#156;ghost studentsâ&#128;&#157; (students who are registered and paid for but who do not&#13;
exist in reality). In addition, some applicants are not being notified that they have been&#13;
awarded the OVC Grant, and this has led to schools receiving the fees from their parents as&#13;
well as from the OVC Grant program. In addition, a number of beneficiaries receive grants&#13;
from both the government and other organizations. The Auditor General has reported that,&#13;
in combination, approximately 8 percent of all beneficiary students fell into one of these&#13;
categories of abuse in FY2009/10, and this resulted in a loss of E6.7 million (US$0.9&#13;
million).59 Ongoing efforts to issue identification numbers to all children and to upgrade the&#13;
management information system for the program should address some of these concerns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
87.        There is no policy on whether beneficiary students should pay any fees not&#13;
covered by the grant, and the absence of such a policy has resulted in students from&#13;
equally poor households being treated differently. Some schools exempt bursary students&#13;
from paying the additional fees while others require them to pay and deny the students&#13;
who do not pay either access to school or to the results of their examinations. This problem&#13;
is compounded by the fact that there is also no policy on school fees so that different&#13;
schools charge widely different fees. In other words, the value of the grant is different for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59&#13;
     Auditor General (2011).&#13;
                                                50&#13;
&amp;#12;different students. Some schools have introduced a cap on OVC numbers, which has&#13;
resulted in the rationing of places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88.    At the school level, financial accounting for the OVC grants received by each school&#13;
is weak. This problem is compounded by the fact that MOET regulations require schools to&#13;
have only one bank account, and funds from all sources are deposited into one account,&#13;
making it difficult to track the use of OVC grants in schools. In addition, schools keep all OVC&#13;
grants received from the government, whether or not the beneficiary children actually&#13;
attend school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.    The Ministry of Education and Training began phasing in free primary education&#13;
(FPE) in 2010 with the aim of extending it gradually to the whole primary school cycle by&#13;
2015. However, FPE will not eliminate all of the barriers to access faced by poor children.&#13;
Even with FPE, primary students will continue to have to pay considerable out-of-pocket&#13;
costs for education, while secondary students are not covered by the program at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90.    The sustainability of the OVC Education Grant program is problematic. The EU,&#13;
which has supported the primary school bursary program, will be changing how it supports&#13;
education in Swaziland to a fully supply-side intervention in which it will give grants to the&#13;
MOET to help schools to improve the quality of primary education. This means that the&#13;
government will now be required to support students who were previously covered under&#13;
the EU-funded part of the program (Capitation Grants) but who are not in a grade covered&#13;
by free primary education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       School Feeding Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
91.    The government introduced the School Feeding Program (SFP) in 1982 in&#13;
partnership with the World Food Program and with early support from UNICEF. The&#13;
objectives of the program are to increase school enrollment, attendance, and retention, to&#13;
                                             51&#13;
&amp;#12;increase learning, to improve childrenâ&#128;&#153;s nutritional status, and to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
local communities to support the program. The SFP is currently implemented by the School&#13;
Health and Nutrition Department within MOET with technical support from the World Food&#13;
Programme (WFP). MOET is responsible for the procurement of commodities for primary&#13;
schools, which NERCHA then delivers. NERCHA is responsible for the procurement and&#13;
distribution of commodities (financed by the Global Fund) to secondary schools. Food is&#13;
delivered to schools three times per year. Save the Children assists with the distribution of&#13;
food and the training of cooks. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s and the Global Fundâ&#128;&#153;s provisions are&#13;
supplemented by food from community donations or school gardens.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
92.     The SFP is financed from multiple sources, and it is impossible to determine the&#13;
actual cost of the program. MOET assumed responsibility for financing the primary school&#13;
component of the program in 2009 and estimates its contribution to the program to have&#13;
been E18.8 million (US$2.7 million) in FY2010/11. Contributions from the Global Fund,&#13;
which supports the secondary school component, are estimated to have been E9.2 million&#13;
(US$1.3 million) in FY 2010/11. The WFP provided food for the SFP in FY 2010/11, but&#13;
neither NERCHA nor the WFP accounts for SFP donations separately so we do not know the&#13;
value of these WFP inputs. Students also finance the program through their annual school&#13;
meal fee of E150 to E200, which is primarily used to pay the salaries of cooks, but the&#13;
Ministry of Education does not collect data on the total value of these fees collected from&#13;
students. Students in receipt of OVC Education Grants are exempt from paying the school&#13;
meal fee as the grant is expected to cover this fee. Under FPE,60 MOET pays schools a per&#13;
capita grant inclusive of the SFP fee. This means that the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s financing of the&#13;
program is both direct (via procurement of food) and indirect via OVC Education Grants and&#13;
FPE Grants to schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60&#13;
  The government has been introducing free primary education on a phased basis. Grades 1-3 are now&#13;
covered. The implications of FPE for the social safety net are discussed in paragraph 141, below.&#13;
                                                   52&#13;
&amp;#12;93.        The SFP provides a cooked lunch to primary and secondary students. In 2011/12,&#13;
790 schools (95 percent of all schools) participated, and meals were served to an&#13;
estimated 264,676 students (Table 11). The meal includes cereals, pulses, and vegetable oil.&#13;
In caloric terms, it represents about 30 percent of a childâ&#128;&#153;s minimum food requirements.&#13;
The average cost of providing the meal (including food and transport) is 8Â½ US cents per day&#13;
or E114 (US$15.68) per year for primary students and E162 (US$21.72) per year for&#13;
secondary students (Table 12).61&#13;

94.        The SFP is an important source of food for poor children, but its long-term&#13;
sustainability is in doubt. The program relies heavily on external support, and the&#13;
government already faces challenges in meeting its share of the program costs. Fiscal flows&#13;
for the program are already irregular, and schools do not always have enough money to pay&#13;
the cooks, in which case no meals are provided. There is some anecdotal evidence that&#13;
attendance drops off on these days. Irregular financial flows sometimes also result in food&#13;
aid being distributed late. As described above, under the FPE initiative, the portion of school&#13;
fee accounted for by the school meal will be paid by the government. The rollout of FPE will&#13;
require an increasing fiscal commitment to the school meal program and further calls into&#13;
question the sustainability of the program. Moreover, the long-term availability of WFP&#13;

&amp;#12;support for the secondary school part of the program is not guaranteed, which means that&#13;
the government might be required to finance the entire program in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
95.      The capacity of the government to implement the School Feeding Program will&#13;
need to be strengthened. Currently only one officer in MOET is assigned to the program&#13;
and works in tandem with [an equivalent person in?] NERCHA. There is limited monitoring&#13;
capacity in MOET, and the program has never been evaluated. Standardized operational&#13;
guidelines for school meals are only now being developed, and it is not clear how they will&#13;
be enforced. MOET already finds it difficult to monitor how schools are implementing the&#13;
SFP, so it is not clear whether schools are providing students with the required meal or are&#13;
diverting this money to other uses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Neighborhood Care Points&#13;
&#13;
96.      Neighborhood Care Points (NCPs) are service delivery points at the community&#13;
level where OVCs can come daily to receive food, psychosocial support, basic health care,&#13;
and pre-primary education (only in some NCPs) and to participate in recreational&#13;
activities.62 NCPs grew out of local volunteers taking the initiative to start informal daycare&#13;
activities. NCPs are a collaborative effort between NERCHA, the WFP, UNICEF, the DSW,&#13;
World Vision, and other NGOs. Initially most NCPs operated in makeshift buildings or&#13;
outdoors, but approximately 46 percent now operate in NERCHA-financed brick and mortar&#13;
buildings (Table 13). Expenditures on NCPs were estimated to have been E15.1 million&#13;
(US$2.1 million) in FY2010/2011, plus E0.4 million (US$0.1 million) for social care services.&#13;
Food is provided by the WFP and World Vision, but information on the value of the&#13;
commodities that they provide is not available.&#13;

  NCPs serve multiple safety net functions, but the largest share of expenditures relates to the provision of&#13;
food, which is why we group them with other in-kind programs.&#13;

97.        The first NCPs were established in 2001 in 18 communities. By 2011, 54,850 children&#13;
aged 5 and under were registered in 1,554 NCPs. Ninety-six percent of centers are open&#13;
every day and 93 percent provide feeding (Figure 18), 83 percent provide psychosocial&#13;
support services, 71 percent provide health care services, and 70 percent provide early&#13;
childhood care.63&#13;

&amp;#12;98.        The primary groups targeted by the NCP project are young children living in child-&#13;
headed households, children orphaned by AIDS, and other vulnerable children who are at&#13;
risk of neglect, abuse, malnutrition, or exploitation. The primary focus is on pre-school-age&#13;
children, although older children also participate in NCP activities, both as beneficiaries and&#13;
as contributors to help with the younger children. The children are selected by the&#13;
communities in consultation with traditional leaders. In some cases, the NCP caregivers&#13;
in collaboration with other community-based workers such as Rural Health Motivators&#13;
take the leading role in the selection process. The National Plan of Action for Children&#13;
(2011-2015) estimates that 50 percent of OVCs aged 2 to 6 years old have received services&#13;
at NCPs, but it is difficult to interpret this finding since it is not clear how many OVCs in this&#13;
age group live in situations that would require them to seek out food and psychosocial&#13;
support at an NCP. NCPs are typically open for half a day (from 8am to 1pm) and provide&#13;
breakfast and lunch â&#128;&#147; a morning bowl of corn soya blend and a hot lunch of maize, pulses,&#13;
and vegetable oil. The cost of providing meals is estimated to be E0.36 (US$0.05) per&#13;
breakfast and E0.47 (US$0.06) per lunch or about E164 (US$22) per child per year.64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99.        NCPs rely on a cadre of volunteer caregivers and community support, and the&#13;
capacity of caregivers and support from communities both vary widely. The caregivers are&#13;
usually adult women selected by the community and ratified by the Chief and Inner Council.&#13;
They are usually unpaid volunteers, some of whom receive food rations as compensation.&#13;
The responsibilities of the NCP caregivers include preparing and serving food, organizing&#13;
and supervising play and development activities, running health promotion activities,&#13;
providing training on hygiene, sanitation, and basic child self-care, taking care of minor&#13;
ailments (such as diarrhea or skin infections), providing education on HIV/ AIDS prevention,&#13;
and protecting children from sexual exploitation and abuse. World Vision has supported the&#13;
training of these caregivers to enable them to fill their care-giving roles. A management&#13;
committee comprising community members oversees the affairs of the NCP. The volunteers&#13;

                                                57&#13;
&amp;#12;are coordinated and monitored by KaGogo Centers, which are responsible for coordinating&#13;
the community response to HIV and AIDS in addition to overseeing NCPs. A program was&#13;
introduced to encourage caregivers to enroll in a certificate program in counseling for&#13;
children at the University of KwaZulu Natal, but not all caregivers have had the opportunity&#13;
to participate. Stress and burnout on the part of caregivers are ongoing concerns. In&#13;
addition, community support for the NCPs has been uneven at best. These design features&#13;
raise questions about the viability and sustainability of NCPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
100.       NCPs provide significant benefits to children, and several assessments have&#13;
indicated that OVCs enrolled in NCPs fare better in terms of welfare than their&#13;
counterparts who are not enrolled in NCPs.65 Children in communities that have NCPs&#13;
have more access to food, health care, education, and overall care and support. There is even&#13;
some evidence that the number of child-head households declined as a result of NCPs,&#13;
possibly because they made the orphans more visible to the community (thereby attracting&#13;
community support for child-headed households) and because they reduced the cost to&#13;
foster families of taking care of an orphan as they provided some of the food for the&#13;
orphans. However, there is no uniformity in the quality of services that NCPs provide or how&#13;
well they function. About 7 percent of centers do not provide meals, which is arguably the&#13;
most important benefit provided by NCPs. NCPs also require a number of inputs beside&#13;
food, particularly learning and recreational materials, furniture, and cooking utensils, which&#13;
are not always available. Finally, young children receive psychosocial support from NCPs,&#13;
but the psychosocial needs of older orphans and vulnerable children are largely ignored.&#13;
The recordkeeping and community monitoring and supervision of NCPs are both uneven.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
101.       For NCPs to be effective, they require significant capacity, cooperation among&#13;
different agencies, and sophisticated monitoring, but it is not clear that these&#13;
requirements are being met. At least three ministries, multiple international agencies, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65&#13;
     UNICEF (2006) and Dlamini (2007)&#13;
                                                58&#13;
&amp;#12;a number of international and local NGOs provide inputs for NCPs (Table 14). As the menu&#13;
of services provided by NCPs expands, particularly in the area of early childhood care and&#13;
development (ECCD), the requirement for agencies to communicate and cooperate&#13;
effectively with each other is becoming even more critical.&#13;

102.   Like other safety net programs, the sustainability of the NCP initiative is&#13;
questionable. The program is dependent on support provided by donors such as UNICEF,&#13;
the WFP, and World Vision, and it is unlikely that the government or the communities&#13;
themselves would have the resources to absorb the operating costs of the NCPs if and when&#13;
donor support were to be withdrawn. This is a particular concern in very poor&#13;
communities. In the long run, the current reliance on volunteers may also not be&#13;
sustainable. Moreover, no government agency has stepped forward to claim ownership of&#13;
the NCPs, and as a result, the NCP draft strategy has never been finalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Food Distribution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
103.   The NDMA in the DPM is responsible for coordinating and managing disaster-&#13;
related activities, including administering the National Disaster Management Fund and&#13;
managing national emergency assistance commodities. In 2006, the government passed&#13;
the Disaster Management Act and established the National Disaster Management Agency&#13;
(NDMA). It subsequently developed a Disaster Risk Reduction Action Plan (2008-2015) and a&#13;
National Disaster Management Policy (2010) in an effort to better manage disasters. The&#13;
                                             59&#13;
&amp;#12;number of recipients served each year is determined annually by the Vulnerability&#13;
Assessment Committee and, based on this number; the government procures food (maize,&#13;
pulses, and oil) from an in-country supplier (only one contract is awarded annually). The&#13;
food is distributed through local government (Iinkhundla) offices in drought-affected areas.&#13;
Each Inkhundla receives 1,000 50kg bags of maize meal, 200 50kg bags of beans, and&#13;
cooking oil in the amount of three times 750ml per person. Food is also distributed through&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
104.    The food is targeted to the elderly, child-headed households, people with&#13;
disabilities, and households containing a chronically ill person. The Chiefâ&#128;&#153;s Assistant at the&#13;
Inkhundla level works with the community disaster committee to determine who is in need.&#13;
Food is typically distributed between September and March with enough food for three&#13;
months given at each distribution. Approximately 67,000 households received assistance&#13;
between November and December 2011, and another 53,000 were scheduled to receive&#13;
assistance between January and March 2012. In FY2010/11, the total costs of food aid were&#13;
estimated to have been E14.0 million (US$2.0 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
105.    The NDMA faces a number of implementation constraints that interfere with the&#13;
effective implementation of the program. The agency has only one professional staff&#13;
member and this means that it is unable to effectively oversee and monitor the distribution&#13;
of food aid. As a result, oversight is provided by Members of Parliament, a situation that&#13;
increases the possibility of political interference in the distribution of food aid. There are no&#13;
clear guidelines for the distribution of food within communities. Finally, transportation&#13;
shortages sometimes result in the late distribution of food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
106.    Also, stakeholders have questioned the continued need for food aid in the context&#13;
of the regularly occurring and seasonal nature of food shortages. According to the&#13;
Vulnerability Assessment Committeeâ&#128;&#153;s 2011 Vulnerability Assessment, there were no major&#13;
shocks to markets during the period between the previous assessment in June 2010 and&#13;
                                           60&#13;
&amp;#12;June 2011. The level of consumer inflation remained relatively low, and Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s trading&#13;
with its major partners remained constant throughout the period under review, suggesting&#13;
that there is scope for the government to move away from providing food aid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other In-kind Social Transfer Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
107.    Supplementary Feeding Programs. The WFP has been the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;
partner in providing support for a supplementary feeding program targeted to&#13;
malnourished people living with HIV, but that program has now been turned into a Food by&#13;
Prescription Program. The benefits include a corn soya blend ration for the patient and a&#13;
family ration of cereals, pulses, and vegetable oil. The program was launched in 2011, and&#13;
between June and December of that year it served 8,664 patients plus up to six of their&#13;
household members at a cost of E3.5 million (US$0.5 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
108.    Food for Work. There is no established safety net program designed to provide&#13;
short-term employment to vulnerable people, but the NDMA began a pilot food-for-work&#13;
scheme in 2011.66 Under the pilot, households that do not fall into the target groups for&#13;
food distribution are required to provide labor to work on a community project. The&#13;
communities themselves determine which infrastructure projects are to be included, but&#13;
there is no financing for asset creation so the work is limited to what communities can do&#13;
with their own tools and resources. Guidelines specify that recipients must do 20 hours of&#13;
work per week for a ration that covers six people, but there seems to be some variation in&#13;
the implementation of this requirement. Communities determine who can work on the&#13;
scheme, with input from the Member of Parliament (MP). In the absence of sufficient&#13;
NDMA staff to monitor the program, monitoring is left to MPs. Communities also determine&#13;
the frequency of the distribution of food. No information is available on how the&#13;
implementation of the pilot is progressing. World Vision also supports food distribution and&#13;
&#13;
66&#13;
  The Ministry of Public Works encourages contractors to hire local labor. The Ministry estimates that 400&#13;
people were employed for short periods in the six contracts executed during FY2010/11.&#13;
                                                     61&#13;
&amp;#12;food-for-work programs that target the elderly, orphans, the disabled, and the chronically&#13;
ill. The pilot program provided support to 20,590 people in 2011 at an estimated cost of&#13;
E0.5 million (US$0.08 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
109.   Fee Waivers for Health Care. Primary health care is free for all age groups. General&#13;
maternal and child health services, including antenatal care, postnatal care, immunizations,&#13;
and family planning services, are also provided for free at public and missionary health&#13;
facilities. In addition, people aged 60 and over and people with disabilities, tuberculosis,&#13;
leprosy, or mental illnesses are exempted from medical fees, except for an E10 registration&#13;
fee. People with disabilities and OVCs receive free transport. There is no policy on fee&#13;
waivers for the indigent so these are currently granted on an ad hoc basis. Public assistance&#13;
beneficiaries are not automatically exempt from health fees. There is no information on the&#13;
number of people exempted from health fees or on the value of the fees waived.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
110.   Phalala Specialist Referral Fund. The Phalala Fund was established in 2001 to help&#13;
poor and uninsured Swazi citizens to access specialist medical care that is not available&#13;
within the country. The program is administered by the MOH under the Administration of&#13;
the Specialist Medical Aid Fund Regulations and is financed from general revenues. Local&#13;
clinicians in public or private clinics and hospitals provide patients with referrals to&#13;
specialists in South Africa, and each referral is reviewed and approved or turned down by a&#13;
committee of medical experts. The MOH provides the patient with a guarantee letter that&#13;
specifies how much is available for his or her care, but in practice the MOH will pay costs in&#13;
excess of the specified limits and there is no incentive for hospitals to limit costs. There&#13;
were 450 beneficiaries in 2010. The Fund receives an allocation of E60 million (US$8.5&#13;
million) annually but has had cost overruns of an undetermined amount every year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
111.   Subsidies for Agricultural Inputs. Since 2005, agricultural subsidies for such inputs&#13;
as fertilizer, limestone, ammonia, and nitrate have been provided to households with OVCs&#13;
and other vulnerable groups. The program is implemented by community volunteers with&#13;
                                               62&#13;
&amp;#12;support from the Global Fund (through NERCHA and the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Cooperatives). Inputs are provided to 324 chiefdoms for use in community gardens (of one&#13;
hectare per chiefdom) and 20 household gardens (of 0.5 hectare per household) per&#13;
chiefdom. Only 101 chiefdoms received support in 2010/11 because the remaining&#13;
chiefdoms had leftover inputs from the previous year. Expenditures were equal to E8&#13;
million (US$1.13 million) in FY2010/2011. There was no allocation in FY2011/12. The plan&#13;
for the future is to support households only, but it is not clear where any funding for future&#13;
subsidies will be available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other Social Safety Net Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
112.   Community-based Programs. Community demand-driven projects are implemented&#13;
by the Micro Projects Program (MPP), a semi-independent unit of the Ministry of Economic&#13;
Planning and Development (MOEPD). The MPP was established in 1988 with support from&#13;
the European Commission. The projects are adopted in response to demand from&#13;
communities in such areas as water, education, electricity, agriculture, health and social&#13;
welfare, dams, and small bridges. The beneficiaries of community demand-driven projects&#13;
must be a clearly identifiable group located in deprived or peri-urban areas. The smallest&#13;
group that can benefit is normally 10 people. The MMP contribution to each project ranges&#13;
from E20,000 to E1 million. Geographic targeting is used to select communities.&#13;
Communities are required to contribute 25 percent of the estimated project cost either in&#13;
cash or in-kind. Operation and maintenance are the responsibility of the community. A total&#13;
of 60 capital projects were completed in 2010/11 with another 12 projects in progress. The&#13;
total cost of these community demand-driven projects was estimated to have been E20&#13;
million (US$2.7 million) in FY2010/11. More recently, the MPP has been charged with&#13;
implementing small-scale capital projects for government ministries. A total of 201 capital&#13;
projects were completed in 2010 at a cost of E93.7 million (US$12.6 million), with E77.2&#13;
million spent on MOET projects, E9.0 million spent on Ministry of Tinkhundla Administration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              63&#13;
&amp;#12;and Development projects, and 7.5 million spent on MOH projects. Community demand-&#13;
driven projects now account for only about 18 percent of MPP expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
113.       Active Labor Market Programs. Labor market programs (for example, second&#13;
chance education, non-formal skills training, labor market mediation services, and&#13;
microenterprise training or credit) are provided by both government and non-government&#13;
providers. The Sebenta Institute offers non-formal primary education programs in all&#13;
primary school subjects plus the siSwati language and the English language. Enrollment in&#13;
2007 was just under 3,300 students. The Emlalatini Development Center provides second&#13;
chance education both face-to-face and through distance learning. At the secondary level,&#13;
the center follows the same curriculum as formal secondary schools and provides programs&#13;
for students requiring second chance education and for those trying to improve their&#13;
examination grades to increase their chances of getting into university, technical and&#13;
vocational education, and/or skills development programs. In 2008, 700 secondary-level&#13;
students were enrolled. In terms of adult basic training and skills development, rural&#13;
education centers are the main providers of this level of education, but their enrollment has&#13;
been declining since 2001. Eighteen non-formal providers receive government assistance to&#13;
cover their instructorsâ&#128;&#153; salaries. Collectively, these providers enroll about 800 trainees a&#13;
year and tend to offer entry-level skills training programs. Two nongovernmental privately&#13;
financed centers enroll about 190 trainees.67 The government provides support for&#13;
microenterprise development through the Small Enterprise Development Company&#13;
(SEDCO), which provides marketing, management consultancy and training, mentoring, and&#13;
legal services. During FY2010/2011, 150 people from the four regions were trained and then&#13;
started businesses, which cost E1.4 million (US$0.2 million). FINCORP, a government&#13;
corporation, provides individual loans to micro- and small businesses and for on-lending by&#13;
smaller lending agencies. In 2009, FINCORP had a gross loan portfolio of approximately&#13;
E42.1 million (US$5.94 million), with a little over 4,500 borrowers.&#13;

&amp;#12;114.       Social Care Services. The DSW provides social care services, including both&#13;
residential and non-residential care. Between October and December 2010, the DSW&#13;
provided counseling services to 523 people including 124 families, 300 children, and 99&#13;
elderly people. It also provides services for the prevention and treatment of domestic&#13;
violence, child abuse, and human trafficking as well as services for people with disabilities.&#13;
The DSW is responsible for supervising residential care facilities in Swaziland, all of which&#13;
are run by NGOs. In 2010/11 there were 1,465 children housed in 40 institutions. The&#13;
National Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Coordinating Unit (NCCU) is responsible for coordinating and upgrading&#13;
psychosocial support services, particularly those provided by the NCPs. In FY2010/11, the&#13;
government supported selected NGOs that were implementing social care services to the&#13;
tune of E1.1 million (US$0.2 million).68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
115.       General Subsidies. There are no general subsidies in Swaziland, but the prices of a&#13;
number of commodities are regulated including those for bread, petrol, liquid petroleum&#13;
gas, and transport. A value added tax (VAT) was introduced on April 1, 2012 on&#13;
commodities and services though a deliberate attempt was made to zero rate goods&#13;
consumed by the poor. It is beyond the scope of this report to assess the likely impact of&#13;
the VAT on poverty, but this information will be needed to inform the design of future&#13;
safety net interventions, particularly cash transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.         Cross-cutting Requirements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
116.       In addition to the constraints identified above for individual programs, there are a&#13;
number of concerns that are common across programs. These are discussed in this section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68&#13;
     Including social care services provided by NCPs through the Lutsango Lwaka Ngwane program.&#13;
                                                      65&#13;
&amp;#12;Developing a Strategic Vision for the Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
117.     Swaziland implements a number of social transfer programs, but the programs do&#13;
not form a coherent whole. Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s social safety net programs are not well coordinated&#13;
and there is a need to clearly define the overall objective of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s safety net. A&#13;
number of policy documents exist that cover some aspects of social protection, but at&#13;
present they do not form a coherent whole. The safety net strategy should spell out the&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s objectives for its safety net system and commit to allocating the resources&#13;
necessary to achieve those objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Increasing Efficiency and Accountability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
118.     Information on the administrative costs of safety net programs is incomplete, but&#13;
available data suggest that administrative costs are high in Swaziland relative to other&#13;
countries. According to the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Estimates of Expenditure, the administrative&#13;
costs of the cash transfer programs run by the DSW account for approximately 15 percent&#13;
of total DSW costs. However, these are actually higher than this as these estimates do not&#13;
include the administrative costs incurred by the DPM in overseeing the program or the costs&#13;
of office space and utilities. The non-transfer costs of the Young Heroes Program (which is&#13;
partially funded by private donor contributions) account for about 45 percent of total costs&#13;
not including the costs of office space and utilities or other support services provided by&#13;
NERCHA but including the costs involved in fundraising. In other countries, administrative&#13;
costs average 8.2 percent of total costs (Table 15).69 Although these international&#13;
comparisons are somewhat outdated and need to be treated with caution as programs&#13;
operate in different contexts and because approaches to measurement may be different,&#13;
these findings suggest that there is considerable scope for reducing administrative costs in&#13;
Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
69&#13;
  Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are cash transfer programs that require beneficiaries to meet&#13;
certain conditions in order to receive benefits, such as sending their children to school or taking them to&#13;
health centers. CCTs and their applicability to Swaziland are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.&#13;
                                                       66&#13;
&amp;#12;119.      Programs use a variety of mechanisms to get cash transfers to households . The&#13;
DSW uses cash and direct deposits for the OAG and checks for the Military Pension and&#13;
Public Assistance (distributed at regional offices). Young Heroes delivers payments through&#13;
the Post Office. Having a range of different payment mechanisms is administratively more&#13;
complex than just having one as it can impede the ability of administrators to oversee and&#13;
reconcile disbursements, thus reducing accountability and control. The transaction costs&#13;
incurred by beneficiaries also differ depending on which payment method is used. The cash&#13;
payments made by the DSW involve significant administrative costs. In addition to the costs&#13;
of funding the police personnel who are involved in safeguarding the distribution of the&#13;
cash, the DSW reports that between 65 and 100 staff are engaged in making payments&#13;
during four months of the year (one month for each quarterly payment).&#13;

&amp;#12;120.       Swaziland has slowly been moving towards paying OAG beneficiaries&#13;
electronically, but this transition has been slower than in some other countries . In&#13;
Swaziland, only 20 percent of OAG beneficiaries currently receive their benefits through&#13;
bank accounts compared to 91 percent in Columbia, 59 percent in South Africa, 34 percent&#13;
in Mexico, and 15 percent in Brazil.70 At the same time, the transaction costs involved in&#13;
depositing benefits into recipientsâ&#128;&#153; bank accounts are high in Swaziland compared to other&#13;
countries (Table 16), although it is important to note that unit costs may be affected by the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s size. International evidence indicates that moving to electronic payments can&#13;
result in cost savings for the programs and that recipients eventually welcome the&#13;
convenience of electronic payments over cash. However, it will take time for their&#13;
entrenched attitudes and behavior patterns to change, and it will require clear, consistent&#13;
communication to explain the advantages of the new payment method. The government&#13;
should attempt to bring current costs down when and if it decides to expand electronic&#13;
payments.&#13;

&amp;#12;121.   As a small state, Swaziland cannot easily realize economies of scale under the best&#13;
of circumstances. However, there is some scope for achieving economies of scale by&#13;
requiring programs to share certain common functions, such as targeting, registration,&#13;
information management, and monitoring and evaluation. For example, a central&#13;
beneficiary registry would provide important monitoring and planning information and&#13;
could reduce abuse.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
122.   Accountability and control mechanisms need to be strengthened . Accountability&#13;
and control mechanisms promote more efficient use of public resources, prevent political&#13;
manipulation, and build public support for programs. In the absence of a modern&#13;
information system that can generate basic monitoring data (for example, on the age,&#13;
gender, payment history, and collection history of recipients), it is difficult to monitor who is&#13;
receiving benefits or to understand why a beneficiary has not collected his or her benefit&#13;
and to plan accordingly. Updated accounting systems are also needed to reconcile&#13;
payments after each payment cycle. The process of paying out cash benefits consumes a&#13;
large amount of time (between 65 and 100 DSW staff devote four months per year to&#13;
making payments). In addition, cash payments leave the government vulnerable to&#13;
uninsured losses, such as a recent robbery of a payment station.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
123.   Setting simple eligibility criteria would reduce the possibility of administrators&#13;
using their own discretion and the opportunity for political manipulation. Eliminating&#13;
intermediaries by transferring benefits directly into the beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; bank accounts or by&#13;
using cell phones or remittance companies would reduce the opportunity for fraud.&#13;
Information and education campaigns would make sure that the programâ&#128;&#153;s eligibility rules,&#13;
benefit levels, and beneficiary rights and obligations were clear to staff, clients, and to the&#13;
general public, which would reduce error and fraud. Appeals mechanisms also enhance&#13;
accountability and control, and collecting information from the public, matching data from&#13;
different sources, randomly checking payments, carrying out client and external audits, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               69&#13;
&amp;#12;increasing sanctions and prosecutions can also help to detect and reduce fraud.71&#13;
Documented policies and procedures governing the operational aspects of safety net&#13;
programs are also needed. At the same time, the Auditor Generalâ&#128;&#153;s Office should be&#13;
congratulated on its efforts to conduct process and financial audits of key programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
124.       Program monitoring is almost universally weak, and there has been no rigorous&#13;
impact evaluation of any safety net program. Most programs collect basic information, but&#13;
these data are not always systematically collated. There is no monitoring and evaluation&#13;
framework to track progress in implementing safety net programs or assessing what progress&#13;
they make towards their objectives. An upgrading of the information system for the OVC&#13;
Education Grant is in progress. An upgraded MIS for the OAG is also needed, and staff need&#13;
to be trained in the use of these systems. There is also a crucial need to devise clear and&#13;
measurable monitoring indicators and to develop a mechanism for systematically reporting&#13;
these monitoring indicators. The lack of regular national monitoring data, particularly on&#13;
poverty, living standards, and the labor force, further impedes monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
The system would benefit from a monitoring framework that includes all programs as well&#13;
as common key performance indicators and a standard methodology for collecting and&#13;
reporting on those indicators. A simple and implementable monitoring framework that&#13;
builds upon a common MIS would help to reduce duplication and overlap and could reduce&#13;
monitoring costs and increase program efficiency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Filling Gaps in the Social Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
125.       The government has made efforts to provide social protection to the poor and&#13;
vulnerable. However, significant numbers of poor and vulnerable people remain&#13;
unprotected, and children seem to be a particularly vulnerable group . As indicated in&#13;
Chapter 2, children have an average poverty rate of about 70 percent, but Swaziland has no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
71&#13;
     van Stolk (2007) and Grosh and Tesliuc (2007)&#13;
                                                     70&#13;
&amp;#12;cash assistance program for extremely poor households with children. The OVC Education&#13;
Grant Program reaches only about 40 percent of children in the poorest quintiles and does&#13;
not cover the considerable out-of-pocket costs of education. The OAG pension was&#13;
introduced to lighten the burden on elderly people caring for orphans, and it has provided&#13;
some support to orphans who live with an elderly person. However, 55 percent of poor&#13;
children and 56 percent of very poor children do not live with an elderly person. Only&#13;
disabled people are now eligible for Public Assistance, and this program has the capacity to&#13;
reach only about 15 percent of the severely disabled and less than 1 percent of the poor.&#13;
Given that the estimated number of extreme poor in Swaziland is 295,000 and that the&#13;
existing safety net reaches many people who are not poor, coverage of the extreme poor is&#13;
low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
126.       The School Feeding Program provides support to all schoolchildren, but children&#13;
who cannot afford to go to school do not benefit. In addition, the School Feeding Program&#13;
faces the same challenges as school feeding programs around the world, in that it only&#13;
provides meals for about 200 days (60 percent) of the year so children do not receive the&#13;
meal during weekends and school holidays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
127.       The attention focused on orphans as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic means&#13;
that less attention has been paid to children made vulnerable by poverty. The two groups&#13;
are not synonymous. Thirty-six percent of orphans are very poor, but 25 percent of orphans&#13;
are not poor. Eight-five percent of extremely poor children are not orphans.72 Fifty-six&#13;
percent of very poor children do not live with an elderly person and, therefore, do not have&#13;
access to any cash assistance for their basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72&#13;
     Authorsâ&#128;&#153; calculations based on SHIES 2009/10.&#13;
                                                     71&#13;
&amp;#12;128.   The removal in 2011 of the indigent category from Public Assistance means that&#13;
the little support that used to be available for very poor households is no longer available.&#13;
Since very poor households with children are the most likely to be extremely poor, this&#13;
means than extremely poor households with children do not have access to any cash&#13;
assistance to help them to meet their basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
129.   There are no public works programs in Swaziland that could mitigate the risks&#13;
involved in different shocks. Public works programs can help unemployed youths and&#13;
adults trade their labor for income to smooth their consumption and can also play an&#13;
important role in supporting households during the agricultural lean season and in the&#13;
aftemath of certain shocks. The government is currently piloting a small food-for-work&#13;
program, but very limited information about this initiative is available. The government&#13;
would need to carefully consider whether an expanded public works program is feasible&#13;
given existing resource and capacity constraints. However, it is still important to note that&#13;
this constitutes a major gap in the safety net as these type of programs have played an&#13;
important role in supporting poor and vulnerable households in other countries. It might be&#13;
a good idea to pilot a public works program from which to learn lessons that would guide&#13;
any potential expansion of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Doing a Better Job of Identifying the Vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
130.   Means-tested programs each have their own application procedures and eligibility&#13;
criteria, and these multiple targeting mechanisms increase administrative costs . Multiple&#13;
application procedures also increase transaction costs for beneficiaries and make it difficult&#13;
for vulnerable people like the poor or children from child-headed households to navigate&#13;
the system. The OVC Education Grant, Child Welfare Grant, and Public Assistance (if the&#13;
latter two are re-introduced) as well as the Young Heroes program, and fee waivers for&#13;
health all use different targeting criteria and procedures although, to a large extent, the&#13;
programs serve the same households.&#13;
                                              72&#13;
&amp;#12;131.    Targeting criteria for programs are subjective, and this increases the likelihood of&#13;
inclusion and exclusion errors. Social workers and program managers have expressed&#13;
concern about the opportunity for elite capture in the community targeting of OVC grants&#13;
and for political interference in the selection of the beneficiaries of means-tested programs.&#13;
At the same time, eligible orphans may be denied benefits because they cannot produce a&#13;
death certificate for their deceased parents, which may signify a family conflict that is&#13;
putting those particular orphans in an even more vulnerable position than those who are&#13;
able to produce the necessary death certificate. The government has developed new&#13;
criteria aimed at making the identification of OVCs more transparent, but they are still very&#13;
vague and open to subjective interpretation (Box 5). More objective and transparent&#13;
targeting mechanisms would significantly reduce the problems that can lead to inclusion&#13;
and exclusion errors.&#13;
&#13;

ï&#130;·   Parents have many children with very limited financial resources.&#13;

Improving the Crisis Response&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
132.    At present Swaziland lacks a safety net that can effectively respond to shocks and&#13;
crises of different kinds. In what is known as a â&#128;&#156;counter-cyclicalâ&#128;&#157; approach, government&#13;
spending on safety nets should ideally increase in times when households are facing crises&#13;
or shocks to help them to weather the shock (as indicated in Chapter 2, food price increases&#13;
and the occurrence of drought/flood are the most common risks faced by poor households)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    73&#13;
&amp;#12;and then should decrease as the impact of the shock subsides. However, the Government of&#13;
Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s response to the fiscal crisis has been to reduce expenditures on safety net&#13;
programs, particularly cash transfers, by delaying payments to some OAG recipients and&#13;
eliminating the element of Public Assistance that was intended to target the poor. This&#13;
approach has served to exacerbate vulnerability and also to increase inequality, which is&#13;
already a problem in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
133.       Natural disasters and economic shocks are often accompanied by significant drops&#13;
in household income and resources, which means that social safety nets should be&#13;
designed to help households that become poor as a result of the shock. If well-designed,&#13;
targeting mechanisms can identify important segments of society in need of assistance,&#13;
such as the newly poor.73 At the same time, there is evidence that ongoing (as opposed to&#13;
emergency) cash transfers can reduce the impact of shocks and, thus, reduce the need for&#13;
emergency interventions. One estimate suggests that, had Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Oportunidades cash&#13;
grant program been in place during the Mexican financial crisis in 1995, the poverty&#13;
headcount, poverty gap, and squared poverty gap would have been 8.8 percent, 17.1&#13;
percent, and 22.5 percent less than their actual values during the crisis.74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
134.       Although many shocks in Swaziland are reoccurring seasonal shocks that are highly&#13;
predictable, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s only real crisis response is to provide food aid. Evidence&#13;
from other countries suggests that cash transfers can help to maintain householdsâ&#128;&#153; food&#13;
consumption, preserve their investments in education and health, and enable them to avoid&#13;
distress sales of their assets. The extent to which cash transfers can do this effectively in&#13;
emergency situations depends on whether local markets exist that are capable of efficiently&#13;
meeting the increased demand and of offering a range of food and goods that are&#13;
accessible to affected populations and with low risk of inflationary pressure. Both&#13;
conditions have been met in recent years, and this means that policymakers in Swaziland&#13;
&#13;
73&#13;
     Blomquist et al (2001).&#13;
74&#13;
     Davis et al (2004).&#13;
                                               74&#13;
&amp;#12;should consider moving away from food aid and towards cash assistance, possibly through a&#13;
public works program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
135.    Swaziland does not currently have a functional public works program. Public works&#13;
programs are a type of safety net intervention in which recipients temporarily trade their&#13;
labor for cash or in-kind payments to smooth their income during crises such as drought or&#13;
recession or during the agricultural off-season. They have been used extensively in&#13;
countries of all income levels around the world and specifically in the developing world as&#13;
counter-cyclical interventions. Not only do they help to reduce short-term poverty but they&#13;
also have the indirect effect of creating or maintaining public assets. However, since the&#13;
cost of transferring US$1 of income to a poor household under a public works program is&#13;
higher than in a simple cash transfer, public works programs need to be carefully&#13;
designed.75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.      Public Expenditures on the Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Trends in Safety Net Spending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
136.    Swaziland spends about 2.2 percent of GDP on its social safety net, and it is&#13;
important to maximize the returns from these investments. In FY2010/11, expenditures on&#13;
the safety net were estimated to have been E584.4 million (US$82.4 million).76 Between&#13;
FY2005/06 and FY2010/11, expenditures increased in both nominal and real terms (Figure&#13;
19) and as a percentage of GDP (Figure 20 â&#128;&#147; also see Annex 5, Annex Table 5.1 for details.&#13;
Spending on the safety net in Swaziland is higher than the average of 1 to 2 percent spent&#13;
by most developing countries77 but is lower than the amount spent by several other&#13;

137.   In-kind transfers account for the largest share of safety net programs, followed by&#13;
cash transfers. Expenditures on cash transfers were estimated to have been E131.6 million&#13;
(US$18.6 million) in FY2010/11 or about 23 percent of safety net expenditures, while&#13;
expenditures on in-kind transfers were estimated to have been E403.8 million (US$57.0&#13;
million) or about 69 percent of safety net spending. In combination, other programs&#13;
received 8 percent of the safety net budget (Annex 5 Table 5.2). Opportunities to rein in&#13;
spending on in-kind transfers, particularly through better targeting and more efficient&#13;
delivery, will need to be explored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
138.   Expenditures on cash transfers are estimated to amount to E131.6 million&#13;
(US$18.6 million) or 23 percent of total safety net spending. The OAG absorbs the largest&#13;
share of cash transfer spending (89 percent), dwarfing all other programs in terms of fiscal&#13;
allocations (Figure 21). Between FY2006/07 and FY2010/11, expenditures on OAG direct&#13;
transfers increased from E42.6 million to E100.3 million (US$6.1 million to US$14.2 million),&#13;
or by 135 percent in nominal terms and 72 percent in real terms.&#13;

&#13;
139.   Capital expenditures, which include externally funded and local capital projects,&#13;
account for about 21 percent of total safety net spending and represent a declining share&#13;
of overall safety net expenditures. Between FY2006/07 and FY2010/11, recurrent&#13;
expenditures on safety net programs increased by over 100 percent in nominal terms and&#13;
by 50 percent in real terms, primarily as a result of increased expenditures on OVC&#13;
Education Grants and the Old Age Grant (OAG). During the same period, capital&#13;
expenditures (funded by both the government and external donors) decreased by an&#13;
estimated 57 percent in real terms (Figure 22).&#13;

&amp;#12;140.   The sustainability of the current social safety net is in question because many key&#13;
programs depend on external funding. A number of key programs, including the SFP, the&#13;
NCPs, and food distribution are either partially or totally funded by external donors. The&#13;
EUâ&#128;&#153;s funding for OVC bursaries ended in 2012. The WFPâ&#128;&#153;s financing of the school feeding&#13;
program ended in 2011, though its support will be temporarily reintroduced in 2012. Young&#13;
Heroes is partially donor-funded, and this has resulted in an unpredictable income stream.&#13;
Global Fund Round 11 was cancelled, and NERCHA is currently receiving resources with&#13;
through an interim financing facility. Future financing flows from the Global Fund are&#13;
uncertain. About 21 percent of total safety net spending comes through the capital budget&#13;
(both foreign and local capital projects), but sustainability requires that key safety net&#13;
programs be absorbed into the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s recurrent budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Impact of the Fiscal Crisis on the Social Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
141.   In the face of budget constraints and because spending on cash grants is&#13;
discretionary, estimated and actual expenditures on cash grants can differ widely. As the&#13;
fiscal crisis deepened, fiscal allocations to cash transfer programs became unreliable. During&#13;
the first three-quarters of FY2011/12, expenditures on cash grants were considerably lower&#13;
than the original budget estimates. Most OAG beneficiaries and all beneficiaries of other&#13;
DSW cash transfer programs received only two quarterly payments during the first three-&#13;
quarters of the fiscal year. At the end of the fourth quarter, beneficiaries who had received&#13;
only two payments received a double payment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142.   The response to the fiscal crisis has exacerbated existing inequalities and may&#13;
increase vulnerability in the future. DSW social workers have reported that OAG recipients&#13;
who have bank accounts are likely to be former formal sector workers (public or private)&#13;
receiving government or private pensions, while the recipients who are paid in cash are&#13;
more likely to be poor. The governmentâ&#128;&#153;s response to the fiscal shortfalls was to pay the&#13;
former group of beneficiaries on time and in full, while paying the latter beneficiaries&#13;
                                               79&#13;
&amp;#12;between one and two months late. The indigent category of Public Assistance was&#13;
suspended, meaning that there is essentially no cash transfer program for poor households&#13;
with no elderly members. Child Welfare Grants were merged with OVC grants, and grants to&#13;
children in hospitals and to fire victims were suspended in FY2011/12 (Table 18).&#13;
&#13;

                               The 10,000 beneficiaries who receive their payments monthly via direct&#13;

&#13;
  Old Age Grant                The 45,692 beneficiaries who are paid in cash quarterly received their full&#13;
                               payments but were paid from one to two months late in each pay period in&#13;
                               FY2011/12. It is therefore likely that these beneficiaries received only three&#13;
                               instead of four payments in FY2011/12.&#13;
  Military Pensions            All pensioners (or their widows) were paid on time and in full.&#13;
                               Support to the indigent under Public Assistance was terminated in 2011, and&#13;
                               935 beneficiaries were dropped from the program. All beneficiaries now fall&#13;
                               under the disability category.&#13;
  Public Assistance&#13;
                               The 3,075 disability beneficiaries who are paid in cash quarterly received their&#13;
                               full payments from one to two months late for each pay period in FY2011/12.&#13;
                               It is likely that these beneficiaries received only three instead of four payments&#13;
                               in FY2011/12.&#13;

HIV/AIDS and Social Safety Net Spending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
143.    The national HIV/AIDS response is guided by the National Multi-sectoral Strategic&#13;
Framework for HIV and AIDS 2009-2014, which devotes a large share of HIV/AIDS&#13;
resources to safety net programs. The framework includes impact mitigation, which it&#13;
defines as programs to alleviate the negative social and economic effects on the lives of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      80&#13;
&amp;#12;people, society, and economy of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty, or income inequalities.78&#13;
The following social safety net programs form the core of the impact mitigation strategy: (i)&#13;
food and nutrition for vulnerable households and individuals; (ii) education support for&#13;
OVCs; (iii) provision of psychosocial support; (iv) community capacity building; and (v)&#13;
building the capacity of the DSW and the National Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Coordination Unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
144.    Strengthening the safety net will strengthen the HIV and AIDS response. Impact&#13;
mitigation absorbs about 30 percent of all spending related to HIV and AIDS. It also accounts&#13;
for 1.6 percent of GDP, and this is projected to increase to 2.3 percent of GDP by&#13;
2020.79 This highlights again the importance of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
the safety net.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.      Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
145.    In assessing the effectiveness of safety net programs, we need to ask how well&#13;
they help households to manage covariate and idiosyncratic risks, including chronic and&#13;
transient poverty, risks that threaten the human capital development of children and&#13;
adolescents, unemployment, disease, and disability. We also need to know how well they&#13;
meet the needs of particularly vulnerable groups, including single-headed households, the&#13;
elderly taking care of children, people with disabilities, and people affected by HIV/AIDS.&#13;
One program alone cannot address all of these critical risks. What will be required is a range&#13;
of programs that, in combination, can protect the poor and vulnerable during periods of&#13;
macroeconomic instability, during economic downturns, and after droughts/floods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
78&#13;
   The three other thematic areas included in the strategic framework are prevention; treatment, care, and&#13;
support; and response management.&#13;

&amp;#12;146.   This review of Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s social transfers indicates that some of the elements of&#13;
an appropriate safety net are present, but the system currently consists of a range of&#13;
uncoordinated programs and some critical challenges remain. These include gaps in&#13;
coverage (particularly of poor children and unemployed youths and adults), leakage of&#13;
benefits to the non-poor, administrative inefficiencies, a lack of effective accountability&#13;
mechanisms, no system for responding to shocks and crises, a lack of adequate monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of programs, and non-sustainable financing arrangements. Programs need&#13;
to be better coordinated, and economies of scale and efficiency gains need to be realized,&#13;
for example, by implementing common application, targeting, and MIS systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
147.   Swaziland faces an unprecedented fiscal crisis, which means that the safety net&#13;
must be carefully constructed to maximize its impact and cost-effectiveness. The following&#13;
chapter looks at options for targeting the safety net so that it can do a better job of&#13;
reaching the needy, and the final chapter discusses sustainable social safety net reforms.&#13;

&amp;#12;             CHAPTER IV: Targeting and the Safety Net in Swaziland&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     The Rationale for Targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
148.   When facing constrained budgets, a natural response for policymakers is to&#13;
consider how to concentrate spending on the poor or otherwise vulnerable . How and&#13;
whom they choose to target affects the cost and potentially the effectiveness of transfer&#13;
programs in reducing poverty. In Swaziland, the government uses a variety of different&#13;
targeting methods. For example, it uses universal (or near-universal) targeting in the Old&#13;
Age Grant and School Feeding programs but aims for a narrower, more specific pool of&#13;
beneficiaries in the OVC Education Grant Scheme and the Public Assistance Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
149.   Targeting involves two decisions â&#128;&#146; whom to target (the eligible group) and how to&#13;
select them (the targeting methodology). Who to target (for example, orphans, the elderly,&#13;
children, or poor households) can sometimes guide the choice of targeting methodology.&#13;
For example, if a government targets the elderly, data from administrative records will be&#13;
needed to determine the age and therefore the eligibility of potential recipients. Deciding&#13;
to target one group, such as households with poor children, does not mean that other&#13;
vulnerable groups, for example orphans or the elderly, will necessarily be excluded.&#13;
However, the decision about which group to target does have significant implications for&#13;
the share of each group selected (Box 6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             83&#13;
&amp;#12;    Box 6: Targeting Cash Transfers in Zambia â&#128;&#146; An Assessment of Different Selection Criteria&#13;
In 2008, researchers analyzed the four selection methods that were being used in a poverty targeted cash&#13;
transfer scheme in Zambia to see which method reached the greatest number of poor children. Similar methods&#13;
are currently being used in several other programs in Africa.&#13;
The first selection method targeted labor-constrained households, defined as households that contained no&#13;
individuals between the ages of 15 and 60 and had a dependency ratio greater than three (3.0). This method is&#13;
similar to those used in programs in Malawi and Zambia. The second method targeted households that&#13;
contained vulnerable adults, defined as a woman or a man over the ages of 55 or 60 respectively, or a disabled&#13;
adult. This method is currently used in the cash transfer program in Mozambique. The third method targeted&#13;
poor households with children under the age of 18, a variation of which is used in the Kenyan OVC cash transfer&#13;
program. The fourth selection method targeted the poorest households without taking into account any other&#13;
characteristic. Eligibility under all four regimes was limited to the households in the bottom three deciles of per&#13;
capita consumption.&#13;
For each method, the researchers identified eligible households and ranked them from poorest to richest based&#13;
on per capita consumption. The table below presents results for the total number of households and individuals&#13;
reached under each selection scheme. In all cases, the share of children in recipient households was at least 40&#13;
percent and reached 48 percent under the third method, which explicitly targeted households with children. All&#13;
four methods, even the first and second, which did not explicitly target children, reached a significant number of&#13;
children (at least 40 percent). However, the proportion of children in the poorest decile varied significantly&#13;
between methods. In the first and second methods, only 36 and 38 percent of children were from the poorest&#13;
consumption decile, in contrast to the third and fourth methods where 68 and 76 percent of children were from&#13;
the bottom consumption decile.&#13;
Orphans (defined here as any type of orphan) represented about 25 percent of all children in the households&#13;
selected by the first and second methods but only about 16 percent of all children under the third and fourth&#13;
methods. Hence, labor-constrained households and those containing vulnerable adults (elderly or disabled)&#13;
seemed to be more likely to contain orphans than other types of households. However, the third and fourth&#13;
methods reached a larger total number of orphans than the first and second. In addition, as we indicated&#13;
earlier, the children reached by the third and fourth methods, including orphans, were poorer than those&#13;
reached by the first and second methods. So the total number of orphans reached under the third and fourth&#13;
methods was greater, and these orphans were from poorer households. Moreover, the first and second&#13;
methods probably missed the poorest orphans, for example, those who did not live in labor-constrained&#13;
households.&#13;

&#13;
In summary, all of the targeting schemes reached a significant number of children. However, the proportion of&#13;
children in the poorest decile was highest in schemes 3 and 4, the absolute number of orphans reached was&#13;
also highest, and these orphans were from the poorest households.&#13;

&#13;
                                                       84&#13;
&amp;#12;150.       Given Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s high poverty levels, it would not be realistic to target all poor&#13;
households so the government will need to identify priority groups, such as children, the&#13;
elderly, and the unemployed. The government would achieve the greatest impact in terms&#13;
of reducing poverty by targeting the extremely poor. This is the group of Swazis who live&#13;
below the food poverty line and do not have enough to eat. This group needs a range of&#13;
safety net assistance including cash transfers to smooth their consumption, education&#13;
grants, school feeding, fee waivers for health care, and perhaps others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
151.       In theory, the gains of targeting can appear to be large, but the associated costs&#13;
may reduce those gains. If all of the benefits provided by a transfer program were received&#13;
by the poorest people in the population, then the same amount of resources would have&#13;
more impact (in terms of reducing poverty) than if they had been universally targeted.&#13;
However, in practice, the full theoretical gain is never realized because targeting is never&#13;
perfect and because there are costs associated with the targeting (including administrative&#13;
costs and transaction costs).80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
152.       Which targeting method/s to choose depends on many different variables, and&#13;
there is no one magic solution to the challenge of targeting. An approach that works well&#13;
in one country may not work as well in another. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s context, community&#13;
structures, institutional capacity, and budget, what data are easily available, and the specific&#13;
program objective are only some of the variables that need to be taken into consideration&#13;
when deciding what targeting method to use. No targeting method is perfect, and they all&#13;
result in some eligible people being erroneously excluded (exclusion errors) and some&#13;
ineligible people being erroneously included (inclusion errors).&#13;

&amp;#12;B.      Common Targeting Methods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
153.    In this section, we briefly describe each of the main targeting methods used in&#13;
transfer programs worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
154.    Geographical targeting identifies beneficiaries by their geographical location&#13;
(regions, districts, or locations) based on the objective of the program. If the programâ&#128;&#153;s aim&#13;
is to reduce poverty, then it focuses its activities in areas with high levels of poverty. If its&#13;
aim is to reduce food insecurity, then it targets food-insecure areas. This method has the&#13;
benefit of being easy to implement and easy to justify as a way of limiting program coverage&#13;
when it is not possible to implement a universal program. Geographical targeting makes&#13;
particular sense in response to localized problems (such as drought). However, this method&#13;
requires adequate data, for example, survey data to rank districts with the largest number&#13;
of a targeted group (such as orphans) or a high level of poverty. The problem is that survey&#13;
data is seldom disaggregated to the lowest levels (such as locations within districts). Thus,&#13;
more specific geographic targeting requires so-called â&#128;&#156;poverty maps,â&#128;&#157; which combine&#13;
survey data and census data to specifically identify the poorest areas of a country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
155.    Means testing involves using data on the income or wealth of potential beneficiaries&#13;
to determine their eligibility. This method is how most programs in developed countries are&#13;
targeted. Per capita income is one measure of welfare, but it is very difficult to obtain&#13;
correct data on earnings, especially in countries with large informal or subsistence&#13;
economies and in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
156.    Proxy means testing (PMT) is an alternative way to measure need in countries&#13;
where income data are unreliable or hard to obtain. The PMT is based on national&#13;
household survey data, and the method uses the ownership of assets and other indicators&#13;
to estimate household income. Since data need to be collected for these proxies, it is&#13;
important to select proxies that are easy to measure and verify, such as the age of&#13;
                                              86&#13;
&amp;#12;household members, the size of the household, the education level of the household head,&#13;
or the type of roof or floor in the home. Each variable is given a weight based on its&#13;
estimated impact on household expenditure (for example, the size of a household may be&#13;
more correlated with poverty than the type of roof or floor.). Once the necessary data have&#13;
been collected from potential beneficiary households, the households are ranked and given&#13;
a score based on those data. Households that receive a score below a certain threshold&#13;
point are eligible for benefits, while households that receive a score above that point are&#13;
not eligible. The threshold to be used can vary even for different programs that use the&#13;
same PMT. For example, the threshold for a cash grant targeted to the poor might be lower&#13;
than the one for accessing an OVC Education Grant or a health fee waiver. The main&#13;
challenges with the PMT method is that: (i) it is administratively demanding to collect the&#13;
necessary data and (ii) it can be challenging to identify easily measurable variables that&#13;
adequately distinguish the poorest from the not so poor (as many of the population may&#13;
live in similar homes and have almost no assets, making it hard to find attributes that&#13;
distinguish the poorest from the less poor). Therefore, the PMT approach is commonly used&#13;
in combination with community-based targeting or validation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
157.   Categorical targeting is based on the idea that certain groups (the elderly, children,&#13;
orphans, or disabled people) are at greater risk of being poor than the general population.&#13;
This form of targeting is complicated by the fact that most vulnerable group members live in&#13;
households with others who can and do contribute to their consumption/welfare. Targeting&#13;
based on age is often politically popular and is administratively simple unless birth&#13;
certificates are not widely available or are unreliable. However, its limitations are that age is&#13;
often only weakly correlated with poverty, or the age group in question may be so&#13;
numerous that covering all members is not financially feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
158.   Self-targeting requires the least data and involves almost no targeting cost.&#13;
Examples include offering a low wage rate for public works employment â&#128;&#147; so only the&#13;
poorest will apply â&#128;&#147; or offering inferior goods (such as yellow maize or broken rice) that&#13;
                                               87&#13;
&amp;#12;families will only take if they are in extreme need, or very small packages of benefits such as&#13;
fertilizer. The main challenge is that policymakers and the public may object to these&#13;
extremely low levels of benefits, but to make them any higher would defeat the objective of&#13;
self-targeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
159.   Community-based targeting involves using community members to identify those&#13;
households who are eligible for a program. Often a group of respected elders or elected&#13;
villagers are given guidelines on who should benefit from the program in question. The&#13;
rationale behind this method is that only local people with knowledge of the community&#13;
can identify those who fall into a specific category (for example, there may be many&#13;
orphans in a village but only some may be destitute). The problems that can arise using this&#13;
method are the risk of favoritism and the risk that communities will spread the benefits too&#13;
thinly because they wish to avoid anyone being excluded. Community-based targeting&#13;
systems are also labor-intensive to set up and support. However, evidence from Africa&#13;
suggests that community-based targeting can be used successfully to identify the poor (Box&#13;
7).&#13;

&amp;#12;                               Box 7: Community-based Targeting in Africa&#13;
&#13;
 The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCT), the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children&#13;
 (CTOVC), and Mozambiqueâ&#128;&#153;s Programa SubsÃ­dio de Alimentos (PSA) Program are targeted cash transfer&#13;
 programs that incorporate demographic eligibility criteria, as well as community-based targeting into their&#13;
 beneficiary selection process. The process in each countries is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#130;· In Malawi, community members form a Community Social Protection Committee that visits each&#13;
   household to verify its eligibility and ranks each household according to need. Results are published&#13;
   publicly. District officials verify that all applicants qualify.&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#130;· In Kenya, districts are selected based on HIV prevalence, and community-level Location OVC Committees&#13;
   (LOC) targets households based on the programâ&#128;&#153;s eligibility criteria. The LOCs visit all households and&#13;
   decide who qualifies. The list is then sent to Nairobi, and enumerators return to households to further&#13;
   prioritize households according to a ranking system.&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#130;· In Mozambique, the applicant applies to a local intermediary or permanente (who is chosen by the&#13;
   community and appointed by National Institute for Social Action (INAS). The permanente completes an&#13;
   application form for the candidate and sends the application to INAS for approval. INAS then visits the&#13;
   candidate to check his or her socioeconomic information.&#13;
&#13;
 The targeting performance of these programs was assessed by examining the share of actual participants&#13;
 who were in the target group. For Malawi, Kenya, and Mozambique, the target group is the poorest 20&#13;
 percent of the population. An assessment of the targeting performance of each program shows that each of&#13;
 the three programs have a targeting performance that is better than the mean of 122 programs assessed in a&#13;
 study of targeting outcomes conducted by Coady et al (2004). Among the subsample of cash transfer&#13;
 programs assessed by Coady et al. the mean score is 1.80 â&#128;&#147; both the Malawi SCT and Kenya CTâ&#128;&#144;OVC have&#13;
 scores that are higher than this, while the Mozambique PSA has a score that is only slightly lower at 1.73.&#13;

C.      Targeting in the Context of Swaziland&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
160.    Little solid evidence is available regarding the efficiency of different targeting&#13;
methods in Swaziland so it is difficult to judge which method/s work better than others.&#13;
In this section, we have attempted to gauge the potential and relevance of each targeting&#13;
method in Swaziland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
161.    Means Testing â&#128;&#147; Very few people in Swaziland currently receive Public Assistance&#13;
benefits and these benefits are means-tested. After reviewing the targeting documentation&#13;
and considering the small number of social workers employed in the entire safety net, we can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      89&#13;
&amp;#12;conclude that this approach is neither systematic nor transparent. The large size of the&#13;
informal sector makes it very difficult to assess household income and income itself is&#13;
generally considered to be an inferior indicator of actual household welfare, especially in&#13;
countries like Swaziland with large non-monetized subsistence agriculture sectors. The small&#13;
number of beneficiaries served relative to need and the lack of any well documented criteria&#13;
for eligibility in this method make it vulnerable to subjectivity and political interference in the&#13;
decision-making process, and too few households receive benefits to make it possible to&#13;
measure these errors reliably.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
162.    Categorical Targeting â&#128;&#147; This is one of the most common targeting methods in&#13;
Swaziland, which makes sense as there are particular categorical groups in Swaziland that&#13;
seem to be more vulnerable than others. First, the elderly and the disabled are a small share&#13;
of the population (6 percent and around 2 percent of the population respectively, with some&#13;
definite overlaps). Children comprise a much larger share of the population â&#128;&#146; about 45&#13;
percent. However, households with many children (five or more children) are noticeably&#13;
poorer than households with fewer children and comprise a smaller share of the population.&#13;
Orphans are not that much poorer than other children and represent a larger share of the&#13;
population (10 percent) than elderly or disabled people (simulations for categorical childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
benefits with perfect targeting are presented in Chapter 5). An alternative would be to&#13;
combine categorical targeting with geographic targeting (based on poverty maps), which&#13;
would make it easier to reach the poorest within a certain categorical group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
163.    Proxy Means Testing â&#128;&#147; Although it is possible to create a PMT formula using the latest&#13;
SHIES data (see examples in Annex Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3), the errors associated with these&#13;
formulas are not insignificant.81 It is also worth highlighting that the targeting formula derived&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
81&#13;
  We used ordinary least squares (OLS) as this is better known to policymakers than probits and logits. Probits&#13;
and logits were also used and yielded similar results (which are available on request). The derivation of the&#13;
PMT is discussed in Annex 4.&#13;
                                                      90&#13;
&amp;#12;from the SHIES is more plausible for use in urban areas than in rural areas.82 Therefore, if&#13;
policymakers wish to consider using the PMT in Swaziland, it will be necessary to develop a&#13;
more reliable PMT formula for rural areas. A possible interim step might be to use data on&#13;
rural livelihoods taken from other sources such as the VAC surveys to derive a better formula.&#13;
Given that it can be challenging to identify variables that easily distinguish the welfare of one&#13;
household from another and the fact that it is administratively demanding to implement a&#13;
PMT, the government would need to carefully assess the expected costs and benefits of a&#13;
PMT in order to decide whether to adopt this method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
164.    Geographical Targeting â&#128;&#147; This is used in some programs, particularly food&#13;
distribution and community-based projects implemented through the MPP. Geographical&#13;
targeting has the potential to increase targeting efficiency in Swaziland. As mentioned in&#13;
Chapter 2, the CSO recently developed poverty maps using the 2009-2010 SHIES and the&#13;
2007 population census. These maps indicate that the poverty level differs substantially&#13;
between districts within the area around any given tinkhundla. In addition, other small area&#13;
statistical databases are available (for example, VAC livelihoods mapping and NERCHA NCP&#13;
mapping). Depending on the objective of a specific program, it may also be worth exploring&#13;
how to combine information from these different sources to increase the accuracy of&#13;
geographic targeting. The poverty maps produced by the CSO could be used to support the&#13;
geographic targeting of safety nets.83 These poverty maps disaggregate poverty rates into&#13;
195 districts, which show fairly sharp differentiation across the country. There are about&#13;
5,000 to 6,000 residents in each district. Using the poverty mapping technique, it would be&#13;
possible to estimate which districts include the poorest populations (Annex 4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
165.    Self-targeting â&#128;&#147; This could be used in Swaziland, for example, in a public works&#13;
intervention. However, it is likely that such a program would be over-subscribed given the&#13;
&#13;
82&#13;
   The urban formula is more plausible in that the coefficients are significant and the expected sign makes&#13;
rough intuitive sense. The R-square of 36 percent is somewhat higher than many typical PMT formulations.&#13;
However, only 12 percent of total number of the poor lives in urban areas.&#13;
83&#13;
   CSO (2011b).&#13;
                                                     91&#13;
&amp;#12;countryâ&#128;&#153;s extremely low employment rates and pervasive and relatively homogenous rural&#13;
poverty as well as the general lack of cash in rural areas. When demand exceeds the supply in&#13;
public works programs, one commonly used approach is to implement a lottery (run in a&#13;
transparent manner) where registration is open to everyone who is interested in participating&#13;
and the lottery decides who among all of these interested participants may participate in the&#13;
program. Alternatively, applicants could be offered a limited period of participation in the&#13;
program, such as a maximum of a certain number of months, to enable more beneficiaries to&#13;
benefit overall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
166.    Community-based Targeting â&#128;&#147; Community-based targeting is used in the OVC Bursary&#13;
Program and is a potentially efficient way to reach the poorest in Swaziland. Community&#13;
members themselves are usually the most knowledgeable about those in their communities&#13;
who are most needy, which means that they can play an important role in targeting.&#13;
Community-based targeting is sometimes used in combination with a PMT, where community&#13;
members are used to verify the list of beneficiaries created using the PMT formula. However,&#13;
community-based targeting would have to be implemented more systematically than is&#13;
currently the case in order for it to work effectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
167.    Many programs use a combination of two or more targeting methods in an effort&#13;
to target intended beneficiaries as accurately as possible. Preliminary findings from an&#13;
ongoing review of the social safety nets in 13 African countries indicate that a wide range of&#13;
targeting mechanisms are used, with programs often using a combination of more than&#13;
one. The methods that are most commonly used in the countries in question are geographic&#13;
targeting (about 50 percent of programs), self-targeting (about 33 percent), community-&#13;
based or categorical targeting (about 26 percent each), and (proxy) means tests (around 10&#13;
percent). However, 60 percent of programs combined at least two methods.84 For example,&#13;
the Lesotho Child Grant Program combines community targeting with PMT verification (Box&#13;
&#13;
84&#13;
  World Bank (2012). The countries included in the draft report are Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso,&#13;
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Tanzania, and Togo.&#13;
                                                     92&#13;
&amp;#12;   8), which is an approach that might be appropriate for Swaziland. However, the&#13;
   Government of Lesotho is still evaluating this approach, and any potential expansion will be&#13;
   based on lessons learned from this initial pilot.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 8: The Child Grant Program and the National Information System for Social Assistance&#13;
                                     (NISSA) in Lesotho&#13;
&#13;
The Child Grants Program (CGP) is an unconditional cash transfer targeted to poor and vulnerable households&#13;
in Lesotho. The primary objective of the CGP is to improve the living standards of orphans and vulnerable children&#13;
(OVC) so as to reduce malnutrition, improve their health status, and increase school enrollment. In order to do so, it&#13;
provides a regular transfer to poor households with children, selected through a combination of an objective proxy&#13;
means test (PMT) and community validation.&#13;
&#13;
The targeting for the CGP follows several steps. Following community mobilization and the formation of Village&#13;
Assistance Committees (VAC), a door-to-door census was conducted to collect information that would inform the first&#13;
stage of selection, which was the application of a PMT to rank households in five different poverty groups (from&#13;
poorest to richest, called NISSA1 to NISSA5). Some categorical filters were also added at this stage, including&#13;
the requirement that only households with children between 0 and 18 be included in subsequent targeting&#13;
steps. The next phase included making the lists of all households registered in the census available to the VACs&#13;
and asking them to confirm that the poorest households on the list were indeed the poorest in the community. The&#13;
final list of selected households consisted of those that were PMT-eligible and had been validated by the VAC.&#13;
&#13;
A recent report that reviewed the CGPâ&#128;&#153;s targeting, including the NISSA, found that households eligible through the&#13;
CGP targeting process were significantly more likely to be poor (74 percent) than those that were not eligible (43&#13;
percent). Moreover, two standard measures of targeting effectiveness are inclusion errors and exclusion errors. In&#13;
the evaluation areas, the poverty rate was 50 percent, but program coverage was only 22 percent, leading to high&#13;
exclusion errors; the study found that 67 percent of poor households were not included in the program. The report&#13;
identified several reasons for this poor targeting performance: (i) the PMT model was estimated using nationally&#13;
representative data and was not designed to reflect local differences in the poverty profile; (ii) the dataset used for&#13;
the estimation of the model (HBS 2002/03) was outdated and the quality of the data was poor, with inconsistencies,&#13;
outliers, and difficulties in data processing; (iii) partly as a consequence of this poor data quality, a series of discrete&#13;
models rather than a continuous model was implemented to predict correlation with consumption expenditure,&#13;
leading to a significant loss of information and precision in the estimation; and (iv) the micro dataset used for the&#13;
estimation of the model did not contain information about key assets or income flows (such as pensions).&#13;
&#13;
The government has a vision for expanding the NISSA into a national system that includes all social assistance&#13;
programs in Lesotho. It is currently in the process of developing a road map for this expansion and is taking into&#13;
considerations the findings of the recent report. The government will carefully analyze the current NISSA and ensure&#13;
that the new design is in line with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s strategy for social protection and social assistance programs, as&#13;
well as ensuring that the design of the program allows for adequate data collection and system maintenance.&#13;

&amp;#12;D.         Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
168.       How well a certain targeting method works depends greatly on how well it is&#13;
implemented. A 2004 study of targeting experience worldwide concluded that self-targeting&#13;
through a low wage rate, geographical targeting, and means testing are the most effective.85&#13;
The study also found that PMT, community-based targeting, and targeting of children can be&#13;
successful but are generally less effective. However, the key message of the study was that&#13;
the correct implementation of any targeting method is more important than the targeting&#13;
method chosen, with 80 percent of the variation in targeting effectiveness being due to&#13;
differences within methods and only 20 percent to the choice of method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
169.       There is need for more solid evidence about which targeting methods work best in&#13;
the context of Swaziland. Given the lack of necessary data, we were not able to do a&#13;
thorough analysis to determine if any particular program was well targeted. Therefore, it is&#13;
important for the government to start testing different methods (or combinations of&#13;
methods) in a systematic way in order to learn lessons that are relevant to the Swazi context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
170.       The little evidence that exists indicates that the safety net programs in Swaziland&#13;
are not particularly well targeted to the poorest. In some cases, the program itself was not&#13;
designed to do so (the School Feeding Program), and in other cases the targeting was not&#13;
correctly implemented (the OAG). By making adjustments to some existing programs, it may&#13;
be possible to target the poorest more efficiently, although this will not be feasible for all&#13;
programs. For example, it may not be desirable to target the School Feeding Program to the&#13;
poorest, since it would be difficult to exclude some children and not others. Geographic&#13;
targeting might be a better possibility if there are areas that are much worse off than others.&#13;
Other programs, such as the OAG, could be better managed to target those who are most in&#13;
need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
85&#13;
     Coady et al (2004).&#13;
                                                 94&#13;
&amp;#12;171.       A combination of targeting approaches would seem to make sense. We noted in&#13;
Chapter 2 that the two major correlates of poverty are rural location and the existence of&#13;
dependents, meaning children and the elderly. Most people in Swaziland live in rural areas&#13;
(76 percent), and children under 18 comprise 45 percent of the population. Neither of these&#13;
two indicators would be useful for targeting benefits to the poorest because they are too&#13;
common. Therefore, one approach could be to combine categorical targeting of children with&#13;
geographic targeting to the poorest areas (using the poverty maps). Census data could be&#13;
used in addition to the poverty maps to produce a â&#128;&#156;dependency mapâ&#128;&#157; where districts with&#13;
the highest numbers of children and elderly could be given priority when providing safety net&#13;
benefits. Another approach might be to combine geographic targeting using poverty maps&#13;
with a PMT. Under this approach, programs would provide benefits to all households (within&#13;
a certain categorical target group) in the very poorest areas, while using a PMT in the areas&#13;
that are not as poor. This approach has been successfully used in El Salvador and Honduras.86&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
172.       If the government wants to explore the possibility of using a PMT, further work will&#13;
need to be done to develop a relevant PMT. The SHIES data make it clear that a PMT would&#13;
not be an effective way to target the poor in rural areas, where 88 percent of the poor are&#13;
located, as consumption is distributed evenly and rural living standards are homogeneous.&#13;
It might be possible to use the VAC surveys in conjunction with the SHIES to devise a PMT&#13;
that would work in the rural areas of Swaziland. A PMT would most likely need to be&#13;
combined with an approach where the community is involved to verify the beneficiary lists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
173.       Self-targeting could be used in a potential public works program but would&#13;
probably have to be combined with another method. Due to the high likelihood that&#13;
demand for employment in a public works program would exceed the supply of available&#13;
places, a lottery approach would be a feasible way of selecting participants among those&#13;
who have expressed an interest in participating.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

     Ripani and Tejerina (2008).&#13;
                                                95&#13;
&amp;#12;174.   Some countries have developed a single unified registration system covering all&#13;
safety net programs, an idea which the government could consider adopting. A unified&#13;
registration system would increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of&#13;
targeting. It would streamline the application process for safety net programs and would use&#13;
objective criteria, screening instruments, and procedures for approval. A less ambitious but&#13;
probably more sustainable idea would be to create a unified registry of beneficiaries of all&#13;
safety net programs to ensure that there are no overlaps or duplication of support among&#13;
these programs. It is worth exploring both of these options further to determine if they might&#13;
be feasible and desirable in the context of Swaziland.&#13;

&amp;#12;     CHAPTER V: TOWARDS EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIVE SOCIAL TRANSFERS&#13;
&#13;
175.   The objective of this study was to lay out viable options for making the safety net&#13;
more effective and responsive, and these are presented in this chapter. It is important to&#13;
note that this report does not intend to be prescriptive but rather to inform the policy&#13;
dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.     A Strategic Role for the Social Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
176.   Persistent poverty and inequality in Swaziland provides a strong justification for&#13;
spending on social transfers. Economic growth is not taking place quickly enough to benefit&#13;
for a large number of Swazis and, as a result, about 30 percent of the population remains&#13;
extremely poor. The persistently high poverty and inequality that prevails in Swaziland is an&#13;
argument for reallocating safety net spending so that a greater share of resources goes to&#13;
the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
177.   The role of larger-scale transfers would be to reduce poverty and inequality by&#13;
supporting the extremely poor while at the same time fostering investments in human&#13;
and physical assets. Well-designed safety net programs can protect extremely poor&#13;
households by providing them with small but reliable amounts of cash to meet their basic&#13;
needs. The safety net can also be productive, in the sense that it combines transfers with&#13;
investments in human capital (health, nutrition, education, and skills) and/or in improving&#13;
and maintaining community assets (such as roads, land, and other physical assets).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
178.   From a fiscal perspective it is not possible to target all poor so it would make sense&#13;
to focus safety nets expenditures on the extreme poor. In Swaziland, the extreme poor&#13;
represent roughly one-third of the population, so this group might be an appropriate target&#13;
group for the safety net. For the most part, these are small landholding households who are&#13;
                                             97&#13;
&amp;#12;stuck in low-productivity agriculture, but this group also includes some urban dwellers. This&#13;
group also includes (but is not limited to) the seasonally poor who survive on subsistence&#13;
agriculture for most of the year but who fall into extreme poverty every year during the&#13;
lean season.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
179.   Based on our analysis, we believe it would make sense to target poor elderly&#13;
people and poor children, as well as unemployed people in the rural areas . Targeting poor&#13;
elderly people makes sense because they are a particularly vulnerable group with few&#13;
income-earning opportunities. To target poor children makes particular sense as an&#13;
investment in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s human capital development to try to break t he&#13;
intergenerational cycle of poverty. Finally, a safety net targeted to unemployed people in&#13;
rural areas who lack sufficient income during low season not only would provide them with&#13;
protection but also act as a counter-cyclical response to different shocks or crises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
180.   The most important attributes of poverty that need to be addressed are low&#13;
human capital development and unemployment. Providing a safety net program targeted&#13;
to children would address the problem of poor households not investing enough in the&#13;
health, nutrition, and education of their children, resulting in the children grow up to be&#13;
low-productivity workers with little earning potential. Unemployment could be reduced by&#13;
the introduction of a public works program. These safety nets must be designed so that&#13;
they can be scaled up in response to large-scale shocks such as drought or food price&#13;
increases and then scaled back down after the crisis is over.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
181.   Political leaders (as well as society as a whole) are often concerned about the&#13;
sustainability of safety net programs and the risk of creating â&#128;&#156;dependencyâ&#128;&#157; among&#13;
beneficiaries, but the Swazi government also recognizes the importance of safety nets for&#13;
supporting certain groups. These groups include the growing number of orphans and the&#13;
vulnerable elderly. The government also recognizes that the informal safety net has been&#13;
substantially weakened by factors such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In addition, recent&#13;
                                            98&#13;
&amp;#12;economic growth does not seem to have benefitted the poorest, and safety nets could play&#13;
an important role in redistributing wealth to those most in need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
182.    One of the main challenges moving forward will be to design a safety net that&#13;
promotes productivity as well as supporting the most vulnerable groups. The concern&#13;
about creating dependency is an argument in favor of adopting programs that promote&#13;
investments in human capital as well as programs that provide temporary employment&#13;
while creating productive assets. As indicated in Box 1 in Chapter 1, safety nets can enable&#13;
households to take up investment opportunities that they would otherwise miss, both in&#13;
the human capital of their children and in the livelihoods of the able-bodied adults. They&#13;
can also help households to manage risk or at least to support themselves and adequately&#13;
nourish and school their children during hard times without having to resort to selling off&#13;
the household and business assets on which their livelihoods are based. Safety net cash&#13;
transfers also constitute an injection of funds directly into the lowest level of the economy,&#13;
where there are multiplier effects that increase demand and fuel growth opportunities at&#13;
the village level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
183.    Safety nets ought to be counter-cyclical, meaning that they can be scaled up in&#13;
time of shocks or crisis and down again afterwards. However, so far the Government of&#13;
Swaziland has taken the opposite (cyclical) approach, not only reducing funding to programs&#13;
after a crisis but also resorting to delaying and/or reducing its payments of cash transfers to&#13;
recipients. To have a more long-lasting impact, cash transfers need to be provided in a&#13;
regular and predictable manner that beneficiaries can rely on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
184.    Swaziland needs to make a strong fiscal commitment to its social safety net. This&#13;
will require the government to identify a core set of programs to which it will then commit&#13;
predictable and sustainable financing. It also means that the government must commit to&#13;
paying benefits on time. Paying benefits late or at unpredictable times makes it impossible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              99&#13;
&amp;#12;for beneficiaries cope effectively with risk and reduces the overall effectiveness of the&#13;
safety net.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       Towards a Social Safety Net Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
185.     Swaziland needs a fully articulated social safety net strategy. The country currently&#13;
has an uncoordinated set of safety net programs implemented by multiple agencies and a&#13;
patchwork of policy documents that cover some aspects of social protection, but these do&#13;
not form a coherent whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
186.     The safety net strategy should spell out the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s objectives for its safety&#13;
net system. It should also specify the resources and programs that will be needed to&#13;
achieve those objectives and define the arrangements for implementing the strategy. The&#13;
safety net strategy should include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Priority target groups&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Priority programs&#13;
     ï&#130;·   A clear road map for rationalizing the safety net and improving service delivery&#13;
     ï&#130;·   An accountability and control framework&#13;
     ï&#130;·   A monitoring and evaluation framework&#13;
     ï&#130;·   A plan for fiscal sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
187.     The first step towards preparing the strategy should be to establish an inter-&#13;
ministerial committee with representatives from all of the ministries that administer&#13;
safety net programs. This committee would oversee the preparation and implementation&#13;
of the Social Safety Net Reform Strategy. At the national level, a multi-sectoral Technical&#13;
Working Group for mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS already exists, composed mainly of&#13;
representatives of institutions that are actively involved in providing impact mitigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              100&#13;
&amp;#12;services. This Working Group could become the core of the inter-ministerial committee for&#13;
safety nets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
188.   The strategy must be developed with the input of all stakeholders in the sector.&#13;
Therefore, the inter-ministerial committee should hold widespread consultations and&#13;
discussions with the NGOs and civil society organizations that play a role in implementing&#13;
social safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
189.   The government will need to decide whether it would prefer to develop a&#13;
comprehensive social protection strategy or a social safety net strategy. A social&#13;
protection strategy would include not only social safety nets but also social insurance&#13;
(pensions and other contributory benefits).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.     Matching Programs to Risks and Vulnerabilities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
190.   Based on this review, we make the following recommendations regarding the&#13;
essential elements of a safety net reform strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Filling Gaps in the Safety Net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
191.   Swaziland implements a range of social transfer programs that together attempt&#13;
to address the various risks faced by the population, but gaps in the safety net remain.&#13;
The gaps related to the protection of extremely poor children and the unemployed are&#13;
particularly significant, and there is a need to increase the ability of the safety net to&#13;
respond to shocks. The question is how best to fill these gaps not only to meet the needs of&#13;
those who are currently vulnerable but also to reduce their vulnerability in the future. The&#13;
most critical objectives in this regard must be the reduction of poverty and the promotion&#13;
of human capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               101&#13;
&amp;#12;192.       Swaziland does not have a cash support program for extremely poor households,&#13;
even households with children. The benefits of giving cash grants to extremely poor&#13;
households with children have been widely documented in developing countries, including&#13;
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Cash grants have many advantages, including: (i) they can&#13;
immediately increase the income of these households (thus reducing overall inequality); (ii)&#13;
they can also immediately increase their consumption; (iii) they increase the amount and&#13;
improve the quality of the food being consumed and also improve nutritional outcomes&#13;
among children; (iv) they can promote school enrollment for children; and (v) they can&#13;
increase household investments in productive assets.87&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
193.       A grant targeted to the poorest households with children could significantly reduce&#13;
poverty in Swaziland. For example, a monthly per child grant of E50 targeted to the poorest&#13;
30 percent of children would benefit about 173,207 children (including 46,611 orphans) at a&#13;
cost of about E103.9 million (US$14.8 million) annually. Simulations using the recent SHIES&#13;
indicate that such a program could lead to a reduction in the extreme poverty headcount&#13;
from 29 percent to 20.7 percent (Table 19). A grant of E100 per month to this same group&#13;
could lead to a reduction of the extreme poverty headcount to 12.9 percent but would cost&#13;
E207.8 million (US$29.7 million) annually.&#13;

194.    The safety net could do a better job of promoting human capital by reallocating&#13;
scarce resources from social safety net activities that do not contribute much to the welfare&#13;
of the poor to interventions that would promote human capital among, for example, Swazi&#13;
children. An example of such a program would be a cash transfer that gives recipients an&#13;
incentive to send their children to school or take them to health facilities. Such a program&#13;
could include conditions where recipients are required to fulfill the conditions or receive a&#13;
penalty for non-compliance or so-called â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; conditions where recipients are simply&#13;
encouraged to comply with the conditions but are not penalized for non-compliance (see&#13;
Box 9).88&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
195.    The Child Grant to be piloted by the Deputy Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office (co-financed by&#13;
the EU and the World Bank) will provide an opportunity to evaluate the best way to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;Softâ&#128;&#157; conditions can be used in an environment where monitoring the conditions would be challenging or&#13;
where there may not be sufficient services available to all participants in the program.&#13;
                                                  103&#13;
&amp;#12;design and implement such a transfer.89 Over 20 developing countries have chosen to&#13;
provide such cash transfers. The pilot Child Grant in Swaziland could be the basis on which a&#13;
national Child Grant could be built.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Box 9: Conditional Cash Transfers&#13;
&#13;
Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) are now implemented in over two dozen developing countries. Almost every&#13;
country in Latin America has a CCT. There are large-scale programs in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey and&#13;
pilot programs in Cambodia, Malawi, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, and South Africa among others. CCTs make&#13;
beneficiaries fulfill specific conditions in return for receiving the grant. These conditions are usually designed&#13;
to promote the human capital development of their children and can include requiring parents to send their&#13;
children to school on a regular basis or to take them for preventive health care visits. Some programs require&#13;
mothers to participate in health education classes. Thus, CCT programs take an integrated approach to&#13;
poverty reduction by balancing goals of social assistance and human capital formation.&#13;
&#13;
The Benefits&#13;
&#13;
CCTs have had positive effects on poverty and household consumption. CCTs have reduced the national&#13;
headcount poverty rate by 8 percent in Ecuador and Mexico, by 4.5 percent in Jamaica, and by 3 percent in&#13;
Brazil. While these effects are modest, they reflect the fact that the pre-transfer incomes of participants were&#13;
well below the poverty line. As a result, although most beneficiary households are still poor, the intensity or&#13;
depth of their poverty has been significantly reduced.&#13;
&#13;
Households that receive CCTs have been found to consume more food of higher quality than households that&#13;
do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels. (It is important to note&#13;
that this has also been observed among recipients of unconditional cash transfer programs.) CCTs have also&#13;
helped households to smooth their consumption during shocks. Evaluation studies have found increased use&#13;
of preventive health care, including vaccinations, and greater use of health centers, which has resulted in&#13;
reduced morbidity rates in several countries. There is also some suggestion that CCTs have contributed to&#13;
increases in childrenâ&#128;&#153;s height and improvements in their health status. In Mexico, a reduction in maternal and&#13;
infant mortality has been reported. CCTs have resulted in increased school enrollment rates among&#13;
participating households, particularly among the poorest children, and improved grade progression. There is&#13;
emerging evidence that CCTs may lead to improved test scores among beneficiary children. There has also&#13;
been a significant decline in child labor among participating households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89&#13;
   The pilot is currently in the design phase, and the specific conditions (or soft conditions) to be used for the&#13;
pilot will be agreed upon during the design of the project.&#13;
                                                       104&#13;
&amp;#12;The Cons&#13;
&#13;
Some argue that conditions are not necessary because demand for health and education increases with&#13;
wealth so families automatically increase their consumption of these goods when provided with additional&#13;
cash. Also, imposing conditions regarding school and clinic attendance can only work if these services are in&#13;
sufficient supply and this is not the case in most countries. Even when supply is available, their poor quality&#13;
can mean that using them will not lead to automatic increases in human capital. Another argument against&#13;
conditional programs is that those who do not fulfill conditions are typically the poorest and most in need.&#13;
Also, monitoring recipientsâ&#128;&#153; compliance with the conditions requires administrative capacity and increases the&#13;
cost of implementing the cash transfer program. Conditions reduce the net benefit of the transfer to&#13;
individuals since the time costs of complying can be high and may be especially onerous for women who are&#13;
often responsible for health and schooling-related decisions within the household. Therefore, some programs&#13;
adopt so called â&#128;&#156;softâ&#128;&#157; conditions where recipients are encouraged to fulfill the conditions, but ar e not&#13;
penalized for non-compliance.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
196.    Public works programs can play an important role in providing income support to&#13;
workers experiencing temporary and chronic unemployment or underemployment. Public&#13;
works programs also tend to be more politically and socially acceptable than other forms of&#13;
transfers because they are perceived to finance productive investments and are not seen as&#13;
a handouts. Furthermore, these programs can be scaled up and down in response to cyclical&#13;
needs (due to shocks and other form of crisis) and, if well-designed, can create physical&#13;
assets that also raise longer-term incomes in the areas affected and contribute to rural&#13;
development (see Box 10). In Swaziland, investments in asset creation have declined as a&#13;
result of the fiscal crisis, and a feasibility assessment would be needed to determine the&#13;
extent of the need for the creation and/or rehabilitation of community assets and the&#13;
maintenance of roads and public buildings. A pilot public works program could then be&#13;
implemented from which policymakers could learn lessons about what works in Swaziland,&#13;
which would then inform the design of any expansion of the public works program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     105&#13;
&amp;#12;                              Box 10: The Productive Safety Net in Ethiopia&#13;
The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) covers about 7.6 million rural people in 290 woredas (districts) in&#13;
eight regions. This is roughly 10 percent of the population and one-third of rural woredas. The main&#13;
component of the program is labor-intensive public works in which the chronically food-insecure are&#13;
employed on rural infrastructure projects such as road construction and maintenance, small-scale irrigation,&#13;
and reforestation. The second component is an unconditional transfer of cash or food to vulnerable&#13;
households with no able-bodied members who are capable of participating in public works projects. The&#13;
objective of the program is to provide households with enough income (cash and/or food) to fill their food gap&#13;
and thereby prevent them from having to sell their household assets while at the same time building assets in&#13;
the community. The majority of beneficiaries (83 percent) participate in public works and the remaining 17&#13;
percent who are labor-constrained receive the unconditional transfer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The annual program budget is around US$347 million, 88 percent of which consists of transfers, with about 60&#13;
percent provided in cash. This represents approximately 1.2 percent of GDP. Roughly 80 percent of the&#13;
transfers are delivered through public works and 20 percent through the unconditional transfers.&#13;
The program is geographically targeted to food-insecure areas using community and administrative targeting&#13;
within areas. A community committee is set up by the woreda to select potential beneficiaries. This committee&#13;
reviews the beneficiary lists, amends them as necessary, and endorses them. Appeal committees exist to&#13;
handle any targeting complaints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The amount transferred is the same whether a family is participating in public works or receiving the&#13;
unconditional transfer. Each person is entitled to the equivalent of five days work per month for six months of&#13;
the year. The payment is 3 kilograms of grain or 10 Ethiopian Birr per day (about US$0.60). The average&#13;
participating household receives about US$137 per year, which is equivalent to about US$2.28 per person per&#13;
month. The Ethiopian PSNP was designed as a way of shifting away from emergency food distribution.&#13;
However, about 48 percent of beneficiaries receive only food, 36 percent receive a mixture of food and a cash&#13;
payment, and 17 percent receive cash only.&#13;

&#13;
Strengthening Existing Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
197.    Any reform of the safety net will also need to take into consideration how to build&#13;
on the programs that are already in place. As discussed in Chapter 3, there are a number of&#13;
important in-kind and cash transfer programs in Swaziland, and several of them could&#13;
continue to play an important role in the overall safety net. There is scope for making them&#13;
operate more efficiently simply by addressing some of the operational challenges&#13;
highlighted in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     106&#13;
&amp;#12;198.       Introducing some form of targeting to the OAG would make the program more&#13;
pro-poor and free up resources for other safety net programs.90 Even though the OAG&#13;
adds little to the consumption of the non-poor, almost one-third of benefits go to non-poor&#13;
households. Enforcing the currently unenforced income exclusion rule (E1, 000 per month&#13;
adjusted for inflation since the program was introduced) would reduce OAG expenditures&#13;
significantly. It is impossible to determine how many beneficiaries would be excluded if the&#13;
income rules were strictly applied. However, targeting the OAG to the extreme poor would&#13;
mean that as many as two-thirds of existing beneficiaries would be removed from the&#13;
program, and this is likely to be unacceptable from a political economy standpoint. Table 20&#13;
presents estimates of the costs involved in various scenarios if the OAG were to be targeted&#13;
to the elderly poor. Targeting the poorest 60 percent would exclude about 30 percent of&#13;
existing beneficiaries and reduce the average consumption of excluded households by only&#13;
3.5 percent, so this is likely to be a politically acceptable reform. While it would be easy to&#13;
apply the means test to recipients of the DSWâ&#128;&#153;s Military Pension and civil service pensions,&#13;
it would be a bigger challenge to determine the incomes of former private sector workers or&#13;
worked in the informal sector.&#13;

  While the study recognizes that political economy is an important aspect of social protection, assessment of&#13;
political economy of social safety nets is beyond the scope of this study.&#13;

&amp;#12;199.    Now that the government has introduced free primary education, the OVC&#13;
Education Grant will not be needed for primary school students, but there will still be a&#13;
need for the program for secondary school students. Several operational challenges need&#13;
to be tackled urgently, including weak targeting and monitoring systems and the absence of&#13;
clear operational policies and procedures at the school level. It is important to note that&#13;
improving the targeting of the education grant would mean that the School Feeding&#13;
Program would also be better targeted since the education grant covers the student&#13;
share of the School Feeding Program. The level of the OVC benefit needs to be&#13;
reconsidered, especially for secondary school students as the grant covers less than 30&#13;
percent of average secondary school fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
200.    The School Feeding Program is one of the larger safety net programs, but it is&#13;
facing implementation and financing challenges. School feeding programs can have&#13;
significant benefits when they are well-designed and delivered including alleviating short-&#13;
term hunger, increasing school enrollments, reducing micronutrient deficiencies, and&#13;
increasing community involvement in schools.91 However, there is currently no evidence of&#13;
the impact of the SFP in Swaziland on attendance, learning, and other outcomes or of how&#13;
efficiently it is being implemented. Therefore, both process and impact evaluations of the&#13;
SFP are needed. The capacity of the MOET to monitor and supervise the program also needs&#13;
to be upgraded. As currently financed, the SFP is not sustainable.92 Therefore, it is&#13;
imperative to assess the full costs of the program to the government and to develop a plan&#13;
to secure government financing for the entire SFP. The possibility of recovering a higher&#13;
proportion of costs from students should also be explored.&#13;

   The secondary school part of the program is funded by the Global Fund (for commodities) and indirectly by&#13;
the government via payment of school fees through the OVC Education Grant. The primary school component&#13;
is funded by the government â&#128;&#147; directly via the procurement of commodities and indirectly via the payment of&#13;
school fees under free primary education and through the OVC Education Grant.&#13;

&amp;#12;201.   NCPs provided an important emergency response for young children during the&#13;
early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but their role as a long-term safety net needs to be&#13;
carefully considered. NCPs now provide a range of services, including feeding, medical&#13;
screening, psycho-social support, and early childhood care and development. However,&#13;
NCPs depend on donated food and are unsustainable from a fiscal perspective. They may&#13;
also be unsustainable from a community perspective as they rely on community&#13;
management, volunteers, maintenance, and donations. It is also of paramount importance&#13;
to establish an institutional home for the NCPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
202.   Other programs should be carefully reviewed with an eye towards increasing their&#13;
efficiency gains and/or terminating those that no longer seem to make sense. For&#13;
example, interviewees reported leakage in the Phalala Fund due to poor oversight and&#13;
ineffective cost control mechanisms. Similarly, the rationale for allowing the Military&#13;
Pensions for World War II veterans to be inherited by wife after wife is questionable. The&#13;
Military Pension is three times higher than the OAG, and beneficiaries can receive both&#13;
grants. On equity grounds, it would make sense to limit beneficiaries to only one&#13;
government-provided cash grant. Also, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s main response to covariate&#13;
shocks is food distribution by the NDMA during the lean season. However, there is&#13;
considerable international evidence that predictable cash transfers are more effective in&#13;
reducing predictable annual food insecurity than emergency aid. Gains in poverty reduction&#13;
are more likely if the government were to reallocate resources away from providing food to&#13;
provide predictable cash-based safety nets (in the form of cash transfers or public works).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.     Options for Sustainable Social Transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
203.   The government needs to be careful to ensure that any expansion of safety net&#13;
spending is affordable while at the same time taking into account the potential future&#13;
&#13;
                                             109&#13;
&amp;#12;cost of not having an adequate safety net. The government currently spends about E584.4&#13;
million (US$82.4 million), which, if evenly distributed among the population, amounts to&#13;
about US$69 per person per year. If perfectly targeted to the extreme poor, this would&#13;
provide a transfer of US$279 per person per year, which is equivalent to 77 percent of the&#13;
annual extreme poverty line (and equal to about US$1 per day). It is also worth highlighting&#13;
that it would require about E74.6 million (US$10.5 million) in transfers to the extreme poor&#13;
to cover the poverty gap, which only represents about 0.27 percent of GDP. In reality it is&#13;
not possible to perfectly target the extreme poor, but these are indicative figures to&#13;
illustrate that, if carefully designed, a safety net is more than affordable for Swaziland.&#13;
However, it will be vital to select the most cost-effective and fiscally sustainable&#13;
instruments. To the extent possible, the government should try to reallocate its existing&#13;
expenditures to ensure that they are used more efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
204.       A well-crafted safety net should serve the dual role of protecting households&#13;
against poverty and promoting their independence and should consist of a range of&#13;
programs that together address the critical risks and vulnerabilities faced by the&#13;
population. Based on the analysis in this report, it would make sense to have the set of core&#13;
safety net programs that is shown in Table 21, which can be combined with other type of&#13;
complementary programs (including, for example, the NCPs, agriculture subsidies, and&#13;
active labor market programs).&#13;
&#13;
                                     Table 21: Core Safety Net Programs&#13;
                       Existing                                              New&#13;
       ï&#130;·    Old Age Grant                             ï&#130;·   Child Grant (with initial pilot)&#13;
       ï&#130;·    School Feeding Program                    ï&#130;·   Public Works (with initial pilot)&#13;
       ï&#130;·    OVC Education Grants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
205.       Rough calculations indicate that this set of core safety net programs would be&#13;
affordable for Swaziland. Indicative costs of these core programs are provided in Table 22.&#13;
It is important to note that these figures are based on very rough estimations and are only&#13;
intended to give indicative figures of the cost and affordability of this proposed core set of&#13;
                                                    110&#13;
&amp;#12;safety net programs. They should not be used for planning or budgeting purposes for which&#13;
more sophisticated simulations would need to be carried out. As shown, the estimated total&#13;
expenditures on the core programs would amount to about E428.6 million (US$60.5&#13;
million). This represents 4.3 percent of central government spending and about 1.6 percent&#13;
of GDP. Swaziland spent an estimated E584.4 million on its safety net in FY2010/11. Taking&#13;
the core programs as proposed and assuming that no changes are made in any of the other&#13;
existing safety programs not included in the core, the new estimated total would be E607.5&#13;
million (US$85.7 million) or 6 percent of central government spending and 2.2 percent of&#13;
GDP. With only a 10 percent reduction in expenditures on the existing â&#128;&#156;non-coreâ&#128;&#157; programs,&#13;
the proposed options would be essentially budget neutral.&#13;

        bursaries (E56.4 million). In absence of information on the flow of students from primary to secondary,&#13;
        we assume the same number of students as in 2011 with some in primary grades uncovered by FPE&#13;
        and some secondary grades. We also assume that any efficiency gains from better targeting are used&#13;
        to increase the amount of the grant, particularly for secondary students.&#13;

        assuming an average of two people per household for six months and with 50 percent going to wages&#13;
        and 50 percent to operating costs and material. This would provide a benefit of E1,793 (US$253) per&#13;
        household per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      111&#13;
&amp;#12;206.   It is important to note that, although NCPs are not included in the set of core&#13;
programs, we feel that it will be necessary to assess the role played by NCPs in the future&#13;
to answer certain questions. For example, should NCPs continue to provide meals and, if&#13;
so, to which children? What other services should NCPs provide? An institutional home for&#13;
the NCPs is needed, and their sustainability will need to be considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
207.   It is also important to highlight the lack of active labor market programs for&#13;
vulnerable youths. Stakeholders noted that poorly educated and unemployed young&#13;
people are a particularly vulnerable group in Swaziland, especially those made further&#13;
vulnerable by the loss of parents and other role models. While it was beyond the scope of&#13;
this report to assess the circumstances faced by young people in Swaziland or to thoroughly&#13;
assess active labor market programs, both assessments will be needed to inform the design&#13;
of programs to fill critical gaps in youth services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
208.   Strengthening administrative capacity and increasing administrative efficiency&#13;
would enhance the sustainability of these core safety net programs. The DSW needs to be&#13;
more proactive in finding alternatives to its current system of cash payments in order to&#13;
reduce the heavy demands on staff time. An improved MIS is being developed for the OVC&#13;
Education Grant, but one is also needed for the OAG. The MIS to be developed for the Child&#13;
Grant could be designed in such a way that it could eventually serve as the MIS for all DSW&#13;
programs, including the OAG. Recordkeeping and monitoring in programs for children are&#13;
impeded by the fact that many children do not have a personal identification number (PIN).&#13;
The government is in the process of issuing these numbers, but this exercise needs to be&#13;
given a higher priority and all bottlenecks to giving PINs to vulnerable children should be&#13;
removed. Being able to identify beneficiary children by their PINs would reduce leakage in&#13;
programs run by the DSW and also enable the MOET to track all children in the school&#13;
system and not just in the schools themselves. The DSWâ&#128;&#153;s MIS could serve as the core of a&#13;
central beneficiary registry that would establish a national targeting system for safety net&#13;
programs. This would be a useful planning and management tool that would also promote&#13;
                                               112&#13;
&amp;#12;accountability and control. Such a registry could be used in other kinds of safety net&#13;
programs as well. Merging small programs, such as the proposed Child Grant and Young&#13;
Heroes, would also reduce administrative overheads. In this theoretical harmonized&#13;
program, Young Heroes would retain its revenue-generating role, and Young Heroes&#13;
beneficiaries would be identified as such by the MIS to ensure accountability to donors.&#13;
Making the households that receive the Child Grant automatically eligible for the OVC&#13;
Education Grants and health fee waivers would also reduce the transaction costs involved in&#13;
targeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
209.   None of Swazilandâ&#128;&#153;s safety net programs seem to have adequate information&#13;
systems, and there appears to be little emphasis on monitoring basic statistics, such as&#13;
the number and characteristics of beneficiaries and the amounts of cash disbursed.&#13;
Developing management information systems for key programs would make it possible to&#13;
monitor whether programs are reaching their targets and achieving their objectives Each&#13;
program should be able to collect and manage data on, for example, the coverage of the&#13;
target group, the benefits provided, the administrative costs and the costs of the benefits&#13;
delivered, and program outcomes such as school enrollment and attendance, clinic&#13;
attendance and vaccination coverage, and employment and earnings outcomes for&#13;
participants in active labor market programs. Because poverty and labor force surveys are&#13;
implemented only infrequently, these data are not currently sufficient for monitoring the&#13;
performance and outcomes of safety net programs. The capacity of the Central Statistical&#13;
Office will need to be strengthened to support more regular implementation of labor force&#13;
and poverty monitoring surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
210.   To increase implementation and coordination capacity, key institutions will need&#13;
to be strengthened. For example, as highlighted already, some of the key implementing&#13;
ministries do not have enough staff to implement the programs efficiently, particularly the&#13;
Deputy Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office, which is the lead agency for social protection in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             113&#13;
&amp;#12;211.   As noted above, the government needs to make a strong fiscal commitment to its&#13;
social safety net. This is not impossible, even in the current fiscal context. Capital&#13;
expenditures, including externally funded and local capital projects, currently account for&#13;
about 21 percent of social safety net spending and for a declining share of the safety net&#13;
budget. This suggests that it will be fiscally feasible for the government to gradually begin to&#13;
fully fund the safety net through the recurrent budget, which is essential to ensure its&#13;
sustainability. At the same time, the government needs to commit to carrying out regular&#13;
financial and process audits of key programs to enhance efficiency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E.     How Targeting Should Be Approached&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
212.   The existing safety net programs are not well-targeted to the neediest. Some of&#13;
these existing programs were not designed to reach the poorest (or neediest), while others&#13;
were designed to do so but have not been well implemented. Revising the targeting&#13;
methods used in existing programs may be challenging for several reasons, including the&#13;
difficulties involved in excluding some of the current beneficiaries. Nevertheless, we highly&#13;
recommend doing so, particularly given the fiscal constraints facing the country and the&#13;
importance of trying to reach those most in need. As already mentioned, an effort should&#13;
be made to enforce the targeting of the OAG, and there seems to be general consensus&#13;
about doing so, particularly since the program was specifically designed to target the needy&#13;
among the elderly population. The government should also make an attempt to improve&#13;
the targeting of the OVC Education Grant, ensuring that support goes to those students who&#13;
are most in need of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
213.   Targeting orphans was an accepted approach in the earlier days of the HIV/AIDS&#13;
pandemic, but singling out orphans is no longer the recommended approach. In the&#13;
context of Swaziland, data indicate that orphans are not necessarily any poorer than&#13;
children in general. International experience has shown that providing support for orphans&#13;
can stigmatize them and can create jealousy among children who are needy or among non-&#13;
                                              114&#13;
&amp;#12;orphans living in the same households as the orphans who are receiving benefits. As discussed&#13;
earlier, singling out orphans in Swaziland means that many children who are not needy&#13;
receive assistance while many extremely needy children fall outside the safety net. One&#13;
approach that governments are taking in some countries is to define OVCs to include&#13;
children who are poor and vulnerable but who may not necessarily be orphaned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
214.   Programs should be designed to target the poorest and most vulnerable people.&#13;
This might be done using a variety of different approaches depending on the objective of&#13;
each program, but experience has shown that using a combination of targeting approaches&#13;
makes the most sense. One method would be to combine geographic targeting (using the&#13;
poverty maps) with geographic targeting. The actual number of people living in a poor area&#13;
could also be taken into account in the geographic targeting phase. This could then be&#13;
reinforced by using categorical targeting to direct the benefits to certain priority groups&#13;
chosen by the government. Another approach might be to combine geographic targeting&#13;
using poverty maps with a PMT. The combination of proxy means testing (PMT),&#13;
community-based targeting, and self-targeting is also worth exploring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F.     The Way Forward&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
215.   Table 23 outlines some key safety net reforms that are suggested by the findings&#13;
of this report. Recommendations are phased and show that both implementation and&#13;
policy improvements are possible at the individual program level. It is recommended that&#13;
the Inter-Ministerial Committee consider these recommendations when developing a Social&#13;
Safety Net Reform Strategy for Swaziland. Additional reforms are likely to be identified&#13;
during the course of national consultations.&#13;

&amp;#12;                              Annex 1: HIES Methodology&#13;
&#13;
216.   The SHIES was conducted in 2009-2010 and involved interviews with 3,167&#13;
households with 14,164 individual members. The sample was random and stratified and,&#13;
using the sampling weights, produced a population total of 1,017,406. The SHIES&#13;
questionnaire was a standard household budget questionnaire with some customization for&#13;
Swaziland, specifically questions on land usage to reflect the role of the chief and to&#13;
ascertain orphan status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
217.   A detailed expenditures diary and agricultural production inventory were collected,&#13;
so that household consumption (including own-consumption of own-produced food) could&#13;
be estimated. The dataset included the estimated basic needs poverty and extreme poverty&#13;
lines. Questions were asked about the householdsâ&#128;&#153; housing attributes including water,&#13;
sanitation, roof, floor, and wall construction, and the number of their consumer durables&#13;
was tallied. Modules on education and health were included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
218.   Unfortunately, the questions on employment and government transfers were&#13;
ambiguous, so there is a degree of uncertainty about the estimates of unemployment and&#13;
benefit incidence.&#13;

&amp;#12;              Annex 4: Poverty Measurements and Poverty Mapping&#13;
&#13;
219.   Poverty is measured by the poverty incidence, gap, and severity indicators. The&#13;
headcount index or poverty incidence is the simplest and most frequently used measure of&#13;
poverty. It represents the fraction of individuals with consumption per adult equivalent&#13;
below the poverty line. The poverty gap index indicates how poor the poor people are, in&#13;
other words, how far below the poverty line their consumption is. The severity of poverty&#13;
indicator is used to measure the inequality of consumption among the poor (some poor&#13;
people may have consumption close to the poverty line, while some may be far from it).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
220.   The Central Statistical Office (CSO) recently completed a poverty map for Swaziland,&#13;
based on the Housing and Population Census of 2007 and the SHIES (CSO, 2011b). The&#13;
poverty mapping technique takes basic demographic data for each of 195 districts in&#13;
Swaziland and imputes the welfare level of the people living in each district (CSO, 2011b).&#13;
The poverty map demonstrates that the four regions of Swaziland are far from homogenous&#13;
and that three of the four regions have pockets of both relative wealth and extreme&#13;
poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
221.   The report also includes Millennium Development Goal indicators for each region,&#13;
tinkundla, and district. The regional pattern of poverty is basically replicated by the 20 other&#13;
indicators used in the report, including school enrollment and employment patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              138&#13;
&amp;#12;                                Annex 5: PMT Formulae and Tables&#13;
&#13;
222.       The following annex includes a summary of the work undertaken by the team&#13;
analyzing the SHIES data for this report. The work was done in collaboration with the CSO,&#13;
and this chapter aims to provide details of some of the technical aspects of how the team&#13;
prepared three different PMT formulas and highlights some of the challenges that they&#13;
faced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
223.       The teamâ&#128;&#153;s multivariate analysis93 indicated a lack of any sharp correlates with&#13;
poverty status beyond rural location and the presence of children or elderly people in the&#13;
household. Factors that are more difficult for social workers to verify (such as education of&#13;
the household head and whether the head worked for one or more hours during the&#13;
preceding month) were also significant in multivariate specifications but not as sharply as&#13;
rural location and presence of dependents in the household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
224.       In Annex Tables 5.1 to 5.3 below, any variables with the suffix â&#128;&#156;dumâ&#128;&#157; are 0-1&#13;
dummies. Other variables are dummies for housing characteristics, such as the type of&#13;
roofing. Demographic and livestock variables without suffixes are counts of variables, so&#13;
that child is the number of children under 18, elderly is the number of people aged 60 or&#13;
over in the household, and cattle is the number of cattle. The demographic variables are&#13;
strongly correlated with household welfare, with an additional child or elderly member&#13;
reducing welfare about the same amount in rural as in urban areas (Annex Table 5.1). In&#13;
urban areas (Annex Table 5.2), having children in the household is sharply negative for&#13;
consumption, while having an elderly household member is positively correlated with&#13;
welfare, which is a paradoxical finding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
93&#13;
     OLS, probit, and logit. Available upon request from: jeanine.braithwaite@gmail.com.&#13;
&#13;
                                                       139&#13;
&amp;#12;225.   Some general findings from the multivariate analysis are that welfare is not&#13;
correlated strongly with livestock holdings in rural areas. For example, the ordinary least&#13;
squares (OLS) regression for the population in general (Annex Table 5.3) found that each&#13;
cow added only SWE 0.7 to household consumption, while having an expensive roof&#13;
contributed SWE 373.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
226.   Children and elderly members subtracted from household consumption in rural&#13;
areas but not as much as using the bush or a field for a toilet or having an unsanitary water&#13;
source. In urban areas, children subtracted very significantly from household consumption,&#13;
but elderly members added to it (although few elderly people actually live in urban areas).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
227.   Some urban households reported owning livestock, presumably on rural plots&#13;
owned by these urban households, or by households in more rural peri-urban settings that&#13;
were classified as urban. Unfortunately, the negative coefficient estimate for cattle in the&#13;
rural OLS is not plausible. In a culture where cattle are still often a bride price and a store of&#13;
wealth, one would expect there to be a large positive coefficient on cattle. Anecdotal&#13;
qualitative evidence from similar countries suggest that livestock are kept to store wealth&#13;
and are only sold when the household needs money to pay for a bride price, a funeral, or&#13;
major illness of a family member. Such irregular expenditures do not show up in the&#13;
consumption aggregate. Monthly consumption in rural areas remains low and living&#13;
standards are relatively homogenous, regardless of wealth holdings. Unfortunately,&#13;
although we tried many different ways of formulating the livestock variables, we could not&#13;
get them to come out more positively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
228.   Despite the teamâ&#128;&#153;s many efforts with alternative specifications, the only kind of&#13;
livestock that was significantly positively correlated with rural household welfare was pigs,&#13;
and then their coefficient was only a fraction of many of the other household attributes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               140&#13;
&amp;#12;229.   The lack of significant, larger coefficients for livestock in rural areas is a serious&#13;
barrier to the creation of a politically acceptable PMT formula based only the SHIES. It&#13;
would be counter-intuitive to offer a PMT without positive coefficients on cattle in rural&#13;
areas. With 88 percent of the poor in rural areas and livestock being a major means by&#13;
which rural households survive and hold wealth, more work is required to develop a reliable&#13;
PMT for rural households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
230.   The urban-only regression (Annex Table 5.2) has a low exclusion error of 4.8 percent,&#13;
but leakage is higher at 25.8 percent. The combined regression is slightly better (as the&#13;
estimates are more robust having been run on a larger number of households), with low&#13;
exclusion errors of 5.2 percent and leakage errors of 17 percent. The rural regression, even&#13;
without significant livestock estimates, also had very low errors of exclusion (5 percent) and&#13;
inclusion (17.4 percent). Exclusion errors are when a poor household is found to be&#13;
ineligible under the targeting formula and â&#128;&#156;leakageâ&#128;&#157; is when a non -poor household is found&#13;
to be eligible. These errors are not that high for social assistance systems, which suggests&#13;
that the system works better for identifying poorer households (low exclusion errors) than&#13;
for excluding non-needy households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
231.   A combination of ad hoc adjustments and human oversight can help to increase the&#13;
targeting efficiency of a PMT. Every scoring formula and every targeting mechanism is&#13;
subject to type I and type II errors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
232.   Another way to increase the targeting efficiency of a PMT is to include an appeals&#13;
mechanism in the program in question, which would enable applicants to appeal against&#13;
being incorrectly excluded from the program by the PMT. A local committee is usually&#13;
established to discuss such cases, but this committee can also investigate cases where&#13;
households have misrepresented data or other errors have occurred .&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
Swaziland has a number of social transfer programs, but these are not well coordinated and&#13;
there is a need to better define the overall priorities of the overall safety net. Swaziland&#13;
spends a significant amount on safety nets but there is room to increase the efficiency of&#13;
spending by: (i) improving coordination between programs; (ii) making adjustments to&#13;
program design and implementation; and (iii) removing some inefficient programs. Social&#13;
transfers could play a larger role in reducing poverty but there are gaps in how well the&#13;
safety net supports extremely poor households with children and/or unemployed household&#13;
members. The assessment recommends that Swaziland should consider adopting a national&#13;
child grant program and a public works program to fill these gaps.&#13;

            Swaziland : using public transfers to
            reduce extreme poverty
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Swaziland has a number of social
            transfer programs, but these are not well coordinated and
            there is a need to better define the overall priorities of
            the overall safety net. Swaziland spends a significant
            amount on safety nets but there is room to increase the
            efficiency of spending by: (i) improving coordination
            between programs; (ii) making adjustments to program design
            and implementation; and (iii) removing some inefficient
            programs. Social transfers could play a larger role in
            reducing poverty but there are gaps in how well the safety
            net supports extremely poor households with children and/or
            unemployed household members. The assessment recommends that
            Swaziland should consider adopting a national child grant
            program and a public works program to fill these gaps.
