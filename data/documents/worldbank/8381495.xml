            creation and how to promote it

        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Group Entrepreneurship
            Survey continues to extend our knowledge of the importance
            of entrepreneurship for a dynamic economy. In its second
            year, with more countries participating, the survey again
            shows a strong relationship between entrepreneurship, the
            business environment, and governance. New data shed light on
            how the distribution of businesses among sectors varies by
            level of development. And analysis of new data on business
            registration suggests that automation can greatly reduce the
            barriers to starting a business. This finding makes a strong
            case for pursuing e-government initiatives to spur entrepreneurship.
