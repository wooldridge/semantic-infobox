  The ratios fell to 12 percent of GNI and 51 percent of gross fixed capital formation in 2012 because of the aid shock. Neighboring&#13;

1.1.3. Inflation, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial sector&#13;
       development: Remaining concerns about credit growth&#13;
&#13;
I  nflation rates remained low as of June 2014. The low inflation rates are attributable to lower import&#13;
   prices, especially for energy and food products. Even though the Rwanda franc depreciated in H2:2013,&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s import prices remained low thanks to lower global commodity prices. Although reserve money,&#13;
the BNRâ&#128;&#153;s monetary policy anchor, increased in H2:2013, the increase was mostly absorbed by commercial&#13;
banksâ&#128;&#153; reserves and therefore had limited impact on the economy. Because of an underdeveloped monetary&#13;
policy transmission mechanism, the revision in the policy rate in June 2013 failed to lower lending rates.&#13;
The pronounced economic slowdown withered both credit demand from the private sector and banksâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
lending appetite, resulting in a sharp drop of credit growth to the private sector in H2:2013 and the first&#13;
quarter of 2014. The BNR cut its policy rate further in June 2014 to stimulate private sector credit growth.&#13;

1.1.4. Fiscal developments: Growing concerns about capital expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T  he fiscal outturn in the first three quarters of FY2013/1421 shows that actual expenditures were 10&#13;
   percentage points below projections. Although total revenue and grants were almost as projected,&#13;
tax revenues were 6.6 percent lower than the projection although improved from the previous fiscal&#13;
year. Given that reducing the reliance on donor funding is the key objective for the government, the&#13;
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) assumes fiscal consolidation through increased revenue&#13;
mobilization and expenditure prioritization to reduce the fiscal gap. The FY2014/15 budget is consistent&#13;
with the MTEF, being based on conservative assumptions about donor funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a. Revenue and Grants                                               in the past few years, actual tax revenue was low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A     id inflows returned to preâ&#128;&#147;aid shortfall                      as a result of the pronounced economic slowdown&#13;
      levels in the first three quarters of                         and delays in implementation of further tax&#13;
FY2013/14. Total grants were projected to be Rwf                    administration measures (for example, the rollout&#13;
333 billion (equivalent to35 percent of projected                   of electronic billing machines22). In contrast, actual&#13;
revenue), but were 4 percent higher at Rwf 346                      nontax revenue exceeded projections by 59 percent&#13;
billion (Table 1.4). The higher-than-projected                      because of higher receipts from peacekeeping&#13;
grants resulted from high capital grants. Capital                   operations.&#13;
grants were projected to be Rwf 184 billion&#13;
(equivalent to 19 percent of the budget). Eventually,               In the FY2014/15 budget, the government&#13;
more than 110 percent of the projected amount was                   projects that it will mobilize more tax revenues&#13;
realized thanks to the frontloading of grants from                  (Table 1.5). While the ratio of domestic revenue to&#13;
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and                    GDP remains unchanged between the FY2013/14&#13;
Malaria. In contrast, actual disbursement of the                    revised budget (17.1 percent) and the FY2014/15&#13;
budgetary grants was lower than projected because                   budget (17.2 percent), tax revenue is projected&#13;
of disbursement delays by the European Union and                    to increase by 0.5 percentage point of GDP from&#13;
Germany.                                                            15.3 percent in the FY2013/14 revised budget&#13;
                                                                    to 15.8 percent in the FY2014/15 budget. The&#13;
Although improved from the previous fiscal                          unchanged domestic revenue is attributable to a&#13;
year, domestic revenue collection fell below                        decline in nontax revenue, which bounces back&#13;
projections by 1.6 percent, which is attributable                   from higher-than-projected reimbursements from&#13;
to lower-than-projected tax revenue. Preliminary                    the United Nations for peacekeeping operations&#13;
numbers from the Rwanda Revenue Authority                           in FY2013/14.Tax revenue is consistent with&#13;
(RRA) indicate that tax revenue for FY2013/14                       medium-term targets for progressively increasing&#13;
was Rwf 759 billion against the target of Rwf 783                   domestic revenue collection and reducing aid&#13;
billion in the revised budget. Although a series of tax             dependence.23 To increase tax revenue, the RRA&#13;
administration measures have been implemented                       has been implementing numerous tax reforms.24&#13;
&#13;

   MINECOFIN has published budget execution reports in the first three quarters of FY2013/14 (http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/&#13;

   Under the MTEF, the government aims to increase tax revenue, on average, 0.8 percentage point of GDP a year by broadening&#13;
   the tax base and reducing exemptions; domestic revenue is projected to increase from 15.3 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 (Rwf&#13;
   874 billion) to 15.8 percent in FY2014/15 (Rwf 986 billion) and 17.2 percent in FY2015/16 (Rwf 1,205 billion). Total grants are&#13;
   projected to increase to Rwf 545 billion in FY2014/15 from Rwf 463 billion, but to decline to Rwf 482 billion in FY 2015/16.&#13;
24&#13;
   These reforms include an increase of excise duty on airtime from 8 percent to 10 percent, continued roll-out of electronic billing&#13;
   machines, taxpayersâ&#128;&#153; education, and investment in information technology facilities to ease the services to the taxpayers.&#13;

1.1.5. Economic Outlook and Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T   he World Bank now projects annual economic growth of 5.7 percent in 2014 and 6.6 percent in 2015,&#13;
    up from the realized growth rate of 4.7 percent in 2013 but down from the previously projected growth&#13;
rate of 7.2 percent for 2014. Signs of recovery in 2014 growth are evident in the strong performance in&#13;
the first quarter. However, the weaker recovery than previously projected is attributable to continued slow&#13;
credit growth to the private sector, delayed implementation of government capital expenditures, negative&#13;
growth of mineral exports and adverse weather conditions in season B. The outlook is contingent on&#13;
accelerated implementation of the delayed government capital expenditures in H2:2014, and the harvest&#13;
for season B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T    he December 2013 edition of the Rwanda&#13;
     Economic Update projected growth of 7.2&#13;
percent in 2014. Those projections were based&#13;
                                                      led to slow credit growth in H2:2013 and H1:2014.&#13;
                                                      Despite the resumption of aid, the implementation&#13;
                                                      of capital expenditure has been delayed in the first&#13;
on an assumption that the lagged effects of the aid   four months of 2014 because of limited capacity&#13;
shortfalls would be concluded by the end of 2013      for implementation.&#13;
thanks to the resumption of aid. Although slower&#13;
than expected because of continued deceleration       In view of these developments, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
of credit to the private sector and delayed           economy is projected to grow at 5.7 percent in&#13;
implementation of capital expenditures, over the      2014 and 6.6 percent in 2015. The revised growth&#13;
last several months the economy has shown signs       rate in 2014 is 1.5 percentage points lower than&#13;
of recovery reflected in the strong performance in    the previously projected growth rate. The lower&#13;
the first quarter of the year.                        growth rate projections reflect a variety of factors,&#13;
                                                      including expected unfavorable agricultural&#13;
However, mixed signals, sent by conflicting signs     harvests due to adverse weather condition in&#13;
regarding imports in capital and intermediate         season B, and the recent contraction in imports&#13;
goods, suggest that economic activity in the          volume of intermediate materials, which was led&#13;
second quarter of 2014 could remain weak.             by the delayed implementations of government&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s growth projection using the          investment projects. The services sector is expected&#13;
Coincident Economic Indicator (see Annex Note         to regain some dynamism because the government&#13;
5) supports this forecast. The Coincident Economic    is expected to accelerate its spending in H2:2014.&#13;
Indicator projects growth of about 6.5 percent&#13;
(year-on-year) in the second quarter of 2014,         The projection, however, is contingent on&#13;
attributable to lower growth in cement consumption    government capital expenditures and the&#13;
and in wholesale and retail trade, and stagnant       international commodity prices of minerals. As&#13;
credit growth to the private sector. Lower cement     discussed in the previous sections, the government&#13;
production growth and stagnant credit growth to       executed only 90 percent of the budgeted amount&#13;
the private sector reflect lower investment, while    of capital expenditures because of its capacity&#13;
lower wholesale and retail trade is caused by lower   limitations. Given the size of the government and its&#13;
household consumption. Whereas government             spillover impacts on the services sector, continued&#13;
borrowing crowded out credit to the private sector    low execution of capital expenditures is a downward&#13;
in 2012, the economic slowdown in H1:2013             risk to economic growth. Furthermore, in the first&#13;
caused weak demand for credit by the private sector   six months of 2014, a decline in international&#13;
and increased nonperforming loans. This, in turn,     commodity prices, especially for coltan, has led&#13;

to a significant deceleration in mineral exports, a                  weaker growth, reflecting adverse weather&#13;
contraction of overall exports, and deterioration                    condition in season B. Both the government and&#13;

in 2014 and 6.7 percent in 2015. The projection&#13;
relies on an assumption that aggressive reforms                      The inflation outlook is negative because of&#13;

growth in the services sector. All sectors are                       those observed in October 2013. Faster depreciation&#13;

to grow at 7 percent, based on an assumption                         important to monitor inflation trends especially as&#13;

&#13;
I  n addition to recent economic developments, the previous section discussed the aid shortfall and the&#13;
   subsequent economic slowdown that revealed Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s structural bottlenecks and vulnerabilities.&#13;
High reliance on aid leaves the economy highly vulnerable to fluctuation in aid inflows. The private&#13;
sector is small and largely reliant on government demand. Rain-fed agriculture makes harvests vulnerable&#13;
to adverse weather conditions. The narrow exports base is vulnerable to fluctuations in international&#13;
commodity prices, which intrinsically results in volatile exports growth. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s relatively weak&#13;
infrastructure base and the low skill base of the workforce restrict private investment. This section&#13;
discusses the medium-term policy priorities to overcome these structural bottlenecks.&#13;

 Box 2.1 What is in a name? â&#128;&#156;Conflict mineralsâ&#128;&#157; in the Great Lakes Region&#13;
 Popular media use a variety of mineral names when discussing the common minerals mined in the Great Lakes&#13;
 region. Below is an overview:&#13;
&#13;
 Cassiteriteis a tin oxide mineral (SnO2). Tin is commonly used in solders, tin plating, electrical conductors, and&#13;
 other applications in the electronics industry.&#13;
&#13;
 Coltan. Two ore groups, columbite and tantalite, share similar features and are often grouped together into one&#13;
 mineral series and referred to as coltan (Ta). Tantalum is used in fabricating capacitors for electric products.&#13;
&#13;
 Wolframiteis an iron manganese tungstate mineral from which tungsten (W) is derived. Tungsten and its alloys are&#13;
 important electrical conductors. Wolframite is often associated with cassiterite.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Tin Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi), and the levy          stability in agreements with companies, are&#13;
required by the International Tin Research Institute       needed. A first-come, first-serve basis is the most&#13;
(ITRI) to implement the system impose further              common approach to ensuring transparency in&#13;
costs to mining operations in Rwanda. However,             access to mineral endowments, supported through&#13;
the alternativeâ&#128;&#148;noncompliance and therefore a              a cadastre system, and has proven to be effective&#13;
veritable ban on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s exportsâ&#128;&#148;would have          in maintaining responsible and robust investment,&#13;
far more disastrous consequences for development           provided that the government is vigilant in ensuring&#13;
through employment and fiscal losses. From this            that the ground is worked and not simply held for&#13;
perspective, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s continued leadership in              speculative purposes (Girones, Pugachevsky, and&#13;
meeting these new international requirements has           Walser 2009). The third requirement is the capacity&#13;

Last, maximizing potential socioeconomic                   development through policies and practices of local&#13;
benefits from mining in Rwanda depends                     sourcing and beneficiation, and support of sound&#13;

In the latter cases, it is assumed that the exporters                                some to the sector. The extent to which these data&#13;

    continued contribution to development will depend on targeted enforcement of Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s labor&#13;

mine in the off-season. For instance,&#13;
in a project baseline study from 2011,&#13;
miners were asked to identify their&#13;
profession. Out of 227 respondents,&#13;
only 20 self-identified with a profession&#13;
other than mining. Of those 20, only one&#13;
considered himself, first and foremost,&#13;
a farmer. Such preliminary evidence&#13;
on the nature of miners in Rwanda&#13;

     Basic ASM data concerns include the following: (1) production statisticsâ&#128;&#148;both disaggregated by mine site and mineral, and&#13;

     paid to traditional chiefs or landholders (often paid in addition to licensing permits if they exist), ad valorem taxes at export,&#13;
     import taxes for transiting minerals from a neighboring country, production taxes at mine sites, potential in-country processing&#13;

 Box 2.3 Artisanal and small-scale mining data challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
 National governments may have two reasons for their renewed interest in their artisanal and small-scale mining&#13;
 (ASM) sectors: (1) domestic pressure to increase revenue mobilization and hence tackle typical informality in the&#13;
 sector; and (2) domestic policy interest in enhancing data and evidence on the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to GDP. The&#13;
 new Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Standard, endorsed in April 2013, is a credible platform&#13;
 for piloting new approaches to ASM data management. Whereas the original EITI standard dealt with mineral&#13;
 revenue reconciliation between what companies declared as taxes paid and what government recorded as taxes&#13;
 earned, the new standard requires countries to provide better data on the size, structure, and potential contribution&#13;
 to be made by ASM in the mineral economy. In recent years, some EITI countriesâ&#128;&#148;such as Ghana, Nigeria,&#13;
 and Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#148;have supported the concept of revenue tracking in their ASM subsectors. In Burundi, the World&#13;
 Bank is supporting the Ministry of Energy and Mines in its piloting of a national database capable of reconciling&#13;
 production and export figures alongside revenues gained. This pilot, in cooperation with the Tin Supply Chain&#13;
 Initiative (iTSCi), could lead to a model replicable in other countries in the region implementing iTSCiâ&#128;&#148;such as&#13;
 Rwanda and the DRC.&#13;

industrial activities will benefit from the                  With the changes to Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s mining law, the&#13;

broader development outcomes as opposed to                   should be addressed. Two areas are of concern: (1)&#13;

sites. Focusing on the type of sector the country            a more manageable volume according to the stated&#13;

could provide government and industry efforts                on streamlined institutional responsibilities and&#13;
with a more efficient orientation. As it stands              clear guidelines from a mine model agreement, may&#13;

                                     Annex Note 1: Monetary policy in Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T   he main missions of the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) are to (1) ensure and maintain price&#13;
    stability; (2) enhance and maintain a stable and competitive financial system without any exclusion;&#13;
and (3) support the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s general economic policies, without prejudice to the two missions referred&#13;
to in (1) and (2) above.51&#13;
&#13;
BNR follows a monetary policy framework that targets reserve money. To achieve its missions,&#13;
especially price stability, BNR targets the level of broad money (M3). However, because BNR cannot&#13;
directly control the level of M3, it focuses on reserve money (mostly banksâ&#128;&#153; reserves) as the operational&#13;
target. In implementing its monetary policy, BNR uses indirect instruments such as open market operations&#13;
(Treasury bills and short-term repurchase agreements) to control the level of reserve money. The key&#13;
assumption of this framework is that the money multiplier (the relationship between M3 and reserve&#13;
money) is stable in the short term.&#13;
&#13;
The framework follows the formula below:&#13;
&#13;
     i) Broad money = Î² Ã&#151; Reserve money(Î² stands for money multiplier52)&#13;
     ii) Reserve money = Currency in circulation+ Reserves of banks&#13;
     iii) Reserves of banks = Required reserves+ Excess reserves.&#13;
&#13;
For Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s monetary policy to achieve price stability, the following three key assumptions must&#13;
hold: (1) the money multiplier must be stable in the short term to ensure that control of reserve money is&#13;
effective for control of broad money; (2) the BNR has the ability to control reserve money; and (3) broad&#13;
money and inflation must be positively correlated. However, these assumptions do not seem to be ensured.&#13;
                                                                Annex Figure 1: Money multiplier is unstable&#13;
(1) The money multiplier is unstable in the short in the short term&#13;
    term (BNR 2012).53 The money multiplier in&#13;
                                                      5.0&#13;
    Rwanda has not been stable (Annex Figure 1)&#13;
    in the short term, but shows a gradual upward&#13;
    trend. Thus, M3 can differ from its target level  4.9&#13;
    when monetary policy decisions are made.&#13;
                                                                 Money multiplier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    4.8&#13;
(2) BNR has limited control of reserve money.&#13;
    Currency in circulation accounts for more than                                  4.7&#13;
    70 percent of reserve money, and currency is out&#13;
    of BNRâ&#128;&#153;s control. Thus, BNR has control of less&#13;
                                                                                    4.6&#13;
    than 30 percent of reserve money (bank reserves&#13;
    at BNR).Although the payment system has&#13;
    developed in the recent past, Rwanda remains                                    4.5&#13;
                                                                                      Jan-13   Mar-13   May-13   Jul-13   Oct-13   Dec-13   Feb-14&#13;

    monetary policy effectiveness.                              Sources: BNR; and World Bank staff calculations.&#13;
&#13;
(3)	 Weak relationship between inflation rates and M3. Inflation rates and M3, as measured by year-&#13;
     on-year growth rates, are weakly correlated (Annex Figure 2). A few possible factors behind the weak&#13;
     correlation are (i) imported goods in the consumer price index (CPI) basket (imported goods account&#13;
     for about 20 percent of the CPI basket; these goods are affected by international commodity prices and&#13;
     exchange rates) and (ii) food prices (food prices are affected by agricultural production).&#13;

(1) High bank concentration and limited Note: M3 = broad money.&#13;
   competition. The Rwandan banking system is&#13;
   still concentrated, with four banks holding more&#13;
   than 54 percent of the total assets of the banking sector. The largest bank holds 32 percent of the&#13;
   total assets of commercial banks. The high concentration and resulting limited competition imply that&#13;
   interest rates are not influenced by policy interest rates, but instead by decisions and circumstances of&#13;
   the large banks.&#13;
&#13;
(2)	Shallow and illiquid money market and interbank market. Excess reserves have accumulated in&#13;
    the banking system, and the excess reserves absorb the impacts of monetary policy. The undeveloped&#13;
    government securities market also limits the scope of open market operations to BNR short-term&#13;
    instruments.&#13;
&#13;
(3) Large informal economy. The existence of the informal economy54 reduces the role monetary policy&#13;
    can play in influencing financing costs, a factor that could go hand in hand with a higher share of&#13;
    currency in circulation. The size of the informal economy and share of currency in circulation could&#13;
    become less of a binding constraint if interest rates fully reflect liquidity conditions and monetary&#13;
    policy and if the public becomes aware of the cost of holding idle money balances.&#13;

three years (red line of Annex Figure 4).             Sources: BNR; and World Bank staff calculations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The upward shifts of the yield curve were observed during the period of high inflation and strong&#13;
growth in credit to the public and private sectors. The inflation rates increased from 0.2 percent in&#13;
December 2010 to 8.0 percent by end-December 2011. A large increase in credit to the private sector (22.5&#13;
percent on average from 13.0 percent in the previous year) was also seen in 2011. In addition, the demand&#13;
for financing of the public sector rose sharply, shown by the 34 percent increase in outstanding Treasury&#13;
bills. In 2012, the yield curve continued to shift upward, with large increases compared with 2011 levels.&#13;
Several factors led to this upward shift. First, the central bank raised its policy rate, the Key Repo Rate,56&#13;
three times, for a cumulative 150 basis points between October 2011 and May 2012 to curb inflation.&#13;
Second, the private and public sectors sustained their demand for financing with more than 30 percent&#13;
increases in their stocks of credit and Treasury bills during H1:2012. Third, the public sector intensified&#13;
its demand to offset the aid reduction that occurred in H2:2012 (see REU-4), while credit to the private&#13;
sector started to slow.&#13;
&#13;
In 2013, the yield curve shifted downward across all maturities, reflecting low inflationary&#13;
expectations and a lower growth forecast. In addition, the momentum of financing to the private sector&#13;
continued to decline as commercial banks became prudent in extending further credit given that their&#13;
balance sheets were impaired by rising nonperforming loans. The reduction in new credit to the private&#13;
sector had left banks with one investment option: Treasury bills. In fact, subscriptions to Treasury bills&#13;
were nearly double the public offer, pushing competitive investors to reduce their interest rates. However,&#13;
interest rates remained positive in real terms because the inflation rate remained moderate.&#13;

   Here, G-securities refer to the Treasury bills issued by the central bank on behalf of the government for budget financing&#13;
   purposes and the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s mop-up operations for the purpose of monetary policy. They include repo operations (http://&#13;
   bnr.rw/index.php?id=205) and the Treasury bills market (http://bnr.rw/index.php?id=328).&#13;
56&#13;
   The Key Repo Rate serves as a ceiling rate for repo operations, which goes a long way toward explaining why interest rates on&#13;
   less than 7-day securities remained almost the same in 2012, while interest rates for other maturities increased by more than&#13;
   450 basis points.&#13;

first three quarters of FY2013/14 (Annex Figure 5).&#13;
&#13;
Budget execution reports prepared by MINECOFIN57 explain that â&#128;&#156;delays in finalizing disbursement&#13;
documentations for projects funded with capital grants and concessional loans particularly in the energy&#13;
and road sectors accounted for this underspending in the Julyâ&#128;&#147;December 2013 period,â&#128;&#157; and for the&#13;
implementation delays in the Energy, Water and Sanitation Authority (both for domestic and foreign&#13;
capital) and the Rwanda Transport Development Agency for domestically funded capital projects.&#13;
&#13;
The disbursement information by ministries and agencies for domestically funded projects58&#13;
enables the progress of domestically funded capital expenditures to be tracked against the annual&#13;
budget.59 Annex Figure 6 shows that several line ministries have made slow progress. Ministries in the&#13;
bottom right quadrant have higher-than-average projected capital expenditures and yet lower-than-average&#13;
disbursement rates (against the annual budget). For example, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA)&#13;
was projected to spend Rwf 157 billion (US$230 million), but actual spending reached only 46 percent of&#13;
budget.&#13;
&#13;
One possible cause for the low and declining disbursement rates is capacity constraints to execute&#13;
capital expenditures. Without enhanced institutional, organizational, and individual capacities, ministries&#13;
and agencies find it difficult to execute capital expenditures beyond certain levels. The negative relationship&#13;
between disbursement rates and the size of the budget suggests that these capacity constraints are major&#13;
hurdles (Annex Figure 7). In the future, more detailed analyses are required of low capital expenditures by&#13;
projects and by ministries and agencies. Then, to address the low capital expenditure disbursement&#13;
rate caused by capacity constraints in certain ministries and agencies, the government should (1)&#13;
address the constraints in the medium term and (2) consider allocating more budgetary resources&#13;
to ministries and projects for which capacity constraints do not exist.&#13;

                                   Annex Note 4: Rebasing national accounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
R    wanda is one of several African countries rebasing their national accounts. Rebasing replaces&#13;
     the old base year used for compiling constant price estimates with a more recent base year.&#13;
Changing the base year means (1) changing the price and quantity base for the individual price and&#13;
quantity relatives and (2) updating the weights used to aggregate the individual quantity relatives into&#13;
sub-indices and to aggregate these sub-indices into more aggregated indices.60 Thus, rebasing tends to&#13;
result in changes to both nominal and constant values in the national accounts.&#13;
&#13;
The results of this rebasing exercise have attracted much attention in recent years. Rebasing in&#13;
Nigeria showed that its economy was larger than that of South Africa, making it the largest economy in&#13;
Africa. Ghana has moved from a low-income to a lower-middle-income country because some informal&#13;
sector activities are now taken into consideration in the calculation of GDP. In Ethiopia, in contrast,&#13;
double-digit economic growth, meeting the countryâ&#128;&#153;s growth target, was revised downward to single-&#13;
digit growth, which failed to meet the growth target. Thus, rebasing the national accounts can have a&#13;
considerable impact on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s macroeconomic strategy, especially when the rebasing paints an&#13;
unexpected picture.&#13;
&#13;
The rebasing exercise in Rwanda61 has resulted in relatively minor changes in the national&#13;
accounts (Annex Table 1). The size of the economy as measured by nominal GDP was revised upward&#13;
by 0.8 percent in 2011 and 0.4 percent in 2012. However, real growth rates turned out to be lower than&#13;
previously estimated by about 1 percentage point. For example, the 2012 growth rate was revised down&#13;
to 7.3 percent from 8.0 percent.&#13;

The growth rates of all three sectors in the production account were revised downward, although&#13;
partly offset by the growth in the adjustment (which includes value-added taxes and other taxes on&#13;
products) (Annex Table 2). For example, growth in services was revised to 10.8 percent, 1.5 percentage&#13;
points lower than previously estimated. In the expenditure account, the results of rebasing show that the&#13;
slowdown in domestic demand started earlier than previously thought in 2012 (Annex Table 3). Most&#13;
notably, the growth rate of private consumption became negative at â&#136;&#146;1.1 percent, and the improvement&#13;
in net exports (that is, the reduction in deficits) was more pronounced than previously reported.&#13;

 Annex Note 5: Coincident economic indicator for Rwandaâ&#128;&#148;A tool for â&#128;&#156;Nowcastingâ&#128;&#157; GDP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C     onsistent with worldwide practices of estimating GDP data, Rwandan GDP numbers are&#13;
      usually published with a delay of about 90 days. The construction of a coincident economic&#13;
indicator (CEI) for Rwanda is based on high-frequency data for estimating the change of GDP in the&#13;
current period. The CEI should help to avoid the typical delay by giving an approximate indication of&#13;
the current state of the economy for prompt policy reaction. Having real-time information on economic&#13;
activity provides two benefits to policy makers. First, GDP estimates based on the CEI will allow&#13;
monetary and fiscal institutions to make more-informed policy decisions. Second, policymakers can use&#13;
it as an input in preparing medium-term macroeconomic projections.&#13;
&#13;
The CEI is based on monthly data that are published in a timely manner and that span seven years.&#13;
In selecting the initial pool of coincident variables, it should be taken into account that the variables&#13;
share a common trend of movement with GDP as determined by the business cycle in the country.&#13;
The methodology for constructing the CEI is based on Opoku-Afari and Dixit (2012), who describe a&#13;
multistep procedure.62 The first selection step for the initial set of variables considers those variables&#13;
that have a correlation sign with GDP according to prior expectations; those that are strongly correlated&#13;
with GDP are selected for further consideration in the model. The model is then evaluated according to&#13;
several criteria such as correlation between the levels and quarterly growth rates of GDP and the CEI,&#13;
goodness of fit coefficient (R2), and closeness of their quarterly growth rates. By conducting iterations&#13;
of the model that include and exclude some of the variables and by testing various combinations of&#13;
variables from a broader pool,63 the final model is selected (the variables included and their respective&#13;
weights are described in Annex Table 4). The highest weight in the composite index goes to credit to&#13;
the private sector, consistent with the estimated weight in Opoku-Afari and Dixit. This underscores the&#13;
importance of credit as a source of external financing to the private sector in Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
The results from the final model suggest that the correlation and the R2 coefficient between the&#13;
levels of GDP and the CEI are estimated to be quite high, 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. The correlation&#13;
between the annual and quarterly rates of growth is calculated to be 0.63 and 0.60, respectively. The R2&#13;
coefficient calculated for the annual and quarterly growth rates between GDP and the CEI are estimated&#13;
to be 0.40 and 0.36, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62&#13;
     Due to its technical nature, the procedure is not explained in detail here. It is available from the authors upon request.&#13;
63&#13;
     The broader pool of variables includes net exports (calculated as a difference of exports and imports of goods); exports of coffee;&#13;
     VAT revenues; M0, M1, M2, and M3 monetary aggregates instead of credit to the private sector; turnover of manufacturing&#13;
     goods; turnover of intermediate goods; and turnover of agricultural products.&#13;

The CEI level closely tracks the movements of the level of GDP throughout the whole period&#13;
with some exceptions (Annex Figure 8). The quarterly contributions of each factor to the variation in&#13;
movements in the level of the CEI can be assessed from Annex Figure 9. The variations in the CEI are&#13;
mostly caused by variations in credit to the private sector, which is expected because of the high weight&#13;
of this variable in the composite index, as well as by electricity production, import of capital goods, and&#13;
trade turnover.&#13;
&#13;
Striking similarities can be seen in the movement of quarterly growth rates of the GDP and CEI&#13;
series (Annex Figure 10). The turning points in economic activity (growth versus slowdown and vice&#13;
versa) are captured quite accurately, suggesting that the CEI may be a useful tool for analyzing economic&#13;
activity in Rwanda for the current quarter.&#13;

To further improve the fit of the CEI, an additional exercise is conducted by including a fiscal&#13;
sector variable such as execution of total budget expenditures. This can be an important factor for&#13;
GDP growth in Rwanda because the government sector and its capital expenditures are quite large.&#13;
The major limitation of including the fiscal sector&#13;

between the quarterly growth rates of GDP and the Note: CEI = coincident economic indicator.&#13;
augmented CEI (Annex Figure 10).&#13;
&#13;
The forecasts using the CEI presented above indicate that economic activity slows in the second&#13;
quarter of 2014. The quarterly growth rate of real seasonally adjusted GDP in the second quarter&#13;
of 2014 should be between 1.2 percent and 2.8 percent (quarter-on-quarter) and 5.2 percent and 6.8&#13;
percent (year-on-year). The growth slowdown is mostly a result of the reduction of the growth of&#13;
cement consumption and wholesale and retail trade and the lower level of rainfall. The rest of the&#13;
variables included in the index have greater positive contributions compared with the previous quarter.&#13;
Any interpretation of the estimates of economic activity should take into account that the CEI comprises&#13;
a narrow set of indicators and in some cases it may over- or underestimate growth.&#13;

tourism sector.&#13;
&#13;
Tourism revenues are dominated by leisure. Rwanda received more than 1 million visitors in 2013&#13;
providing tourism revenues of US$294 million. Some 37 percent of visitors came to Rwanda for&#13;
business purposes, followed by visiting friends and families (29 percent), and transit and other purposes&#13;
(24 percent).Fewer than 10 percent of visitors came for holiday or leisure purposes. However, about&#13;
half of tourism revenues were generated by tourists who came for holiday or leisure purposes (Annex&#13;
Figure 12); average revenues per visitor are very different across the different purposes for visiting&#13;
(Annex Figure 13).64&#13;

approach.&#13;
&#13;
Performance in Q1:2014 continued to improve. In Q1:2014, the number of tourists increased by 4.4&#13;
percent as compared with the same period in 2013, and tourism revenues increased by 5.0 percent. The&#13;
performance is quite similar to the overall performance in 2013 (number of tourists increased by 5.7&#13;
percent, and revenue increased by 4.2 percent).The annual AfDB meeting in May 2014 may have had a&#13;
positive impact on tourism. In 2013, tourists for business purposes on average spent US$231 per visit. If&#13;
this data is applied and assuming there were 5,000 participants, the estimated impact would be US$1.2&#13;
million which is equivalent to 0.4 percent of the total tourism revenues in 2013.&#13;

      Annex Note 7: Impact of commodity price change on Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s trade balance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I  n Rwanda, the main export items are traditional products such as coffee, tea, and minerals&#13;
   (cassiterite, coltan, and wolframite), which accounted for 45 percent of total exports in 2012.&#13;
A decline in international commodity prices for these products is likely to have a negative impact on&#13;
exports. However, as proved during the global financial crisis in 2009, the overall impact on the economy&#13;
is likely to be very limited for two reasons. First, the share of exports in GDP is relatively low at 13.2&#13;
percent in 2012, which is lower than neighboring countries. Second, the impact on exports is likely to be&#13;
offset by a decline in imports of fuels.&#13;
&#13;
Exports in the Economy&#13;
Between 2010 and 2012, exports grew by 38 percent per year, but decelerated in 2013 with a growth rate&#13;
of 18.7 percent. The share of exports in the economy was 16.6 percent in the first three quarters of 2013,&#13;
which is lower than neighboring countries such as Kenya (26.9 percent), Tanzania (30.5 percent), and&#13;
Uganda (20.5 percent).65 Therefore, the relative impact of a decline in international commodity prices on&#13;
the economy through exports is likely to be smaller than in the neighboring countries.&#13;
&#13;
Traditional Products in Exports&#13;
The traditional products have played a major role in exports. The share of the traditional products in total&#13;
goods exports increased from 45 percent in 2012 to 62 percent in 2013. The share of minerals in total&#13;
exports increased most, from 28 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2013. The traditional products accounted&#13;
for 80 percent of export growth in 2013 (of which, coffee â&#136;&#146;5 percent, tea â&#136;&#146;8.3 percent, and minerals 190&#13;
percent. If prices of the traditional products decline by 10 percent,66 total exports will decline by US$49&#13;
million or 14 percent of total exports (Annex Table 5).&#13;
&#13;
Impact on Imports&#13;
However, the impact on exports is likely to be offset by a decline in imports. Rwanda has been experiencing&#13;
persistent trade deficits due to large imports. In 2012, the trade deficit in goods reached US$1,376 million.&#13;
Among import items, imports of energy and lubricants reached US$289 million or 16.4 percent of total&#13;
imports. The value of energy and lubricants imports was larger than the sum of the traditional exports&#13;
(US$263 million)67 during the same period. In other words, if prices decline to the same degree across&#13;
different types of commodities, the impact on exports will be offset by that on imports.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Rwanda economic update reports on
            and synthesizes recent economic developments and places them
            in a medium-term and global context. It analyzes the
            implications of these developments and policies for the
            outlook of Rwanda&#146;s economy. These reports attempt to make
            an analytical contribution to the implementation of Rwanda&#146;s
            national development strategy. Each edition of the report
            includes a special feature on a selected topic. The report
            is intended for a wide audience, including policy makers,
            business leaders and other market participants, and the
            community of analysts engaged in Rwanda&#146;s economy.
