HUNGARY&#13;
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:         Municipality of Budapest&#13;
Beneficiaries:    Budapest Transport Company (BKV) and Municipality of Budapest&#13;
Amount:           US$38.0 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:            Fifteen years maturity including a grace period of five years at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Poverty Category: Not applicable&#13;
Objectives:       The overall objective is to support the urban transport reforms undertaken&#13;
by the City of Budapest and BKV. Specific objectives are to: (a)&#13;
modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; (b) implement&#13;
a parking control policy; (c) decrease subsidies to BKV by reducing&#13;
operating costs, increasing tariffs and separating noncore activities, and&#13;
by introducing the private provision of public transport services; (d)&#13;
contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest; and (e) establish&#13;
a formal contractual relationship between BKV and the City of Budapest.&#13;
Description:      The project would consist of: (a) the replacement of 50 wom-out buses&#13;
with low-polluting and energy-efficient substitutes; (b) the rehabilitation&#13;
of about 47 km of womout tramway tracks and the purchase of track&#13;
maintenance equipment; (c) the second phase of an automatic vehicle&#13;
monitoring system; and (d) technical assistance and training in financial&#13;
management, economic evaluation of projects, marketing, organization,&#13;
and technical issues.&#13;
Justification:    Car ownership, traffic congestion, and air pollution are increasing rapidly&#13;
in Budapest. Past subsidies, which Government can no longer afford,&#13;
contributed to an uneconomically high level of services, ridership, and&#13;
employment, while the financial constraints that followed contributed to&#13;
the physical deterioration of the system.  To address these issues,&#13;
Budapest is introducing a parking management scheme, improving the&#13;
coordination of urban transport services, introducing private transport&#13;
services on a trial basis, and improving investment selection. BKV is also&#13;
taking steps to increase its cost recovery, reduce fare evasion, improve&#13;
operational performance, separate noncore activities, and contract out&#13;
additional construction activities.   The institutional improvements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
supported by the project are expected to reduce the cost of public and&#13;
private transportation, and thereby increase real incomes.&#13;
Risks:             The greatest project risk is that BKV will fail to meet its cost recovery or&#13;
operating ratio targets, resulting in a further deterioration of plant and&#13;
operations. This could result from the failure of the Municipality to&#13;
approve timely and sufficient tariff increases, or to provide an adequate&#13;
level of subsidy.  Experience in other countries demonstrates that&#13;
maintenance deteriorates when public transport organizations have&#13;
insufficient funds. However, the Municipality and BKV have already&#13;
increased BKV's cost recovery from 19 percent in 1986 to 34 percent in&#13;
1994. They have provided assurances at all levels that they will take the&#13;
necessary steps to meet the 50 percent cost recovery target by 2000. In&#13;
addition, BKV is satisfactorily implementing their component of the&#13;
Second Transport Sector Project and the EBRD Urban Transport Project.&#13;
Financial risks are therefore considered to be acceptable.&#13;
A second project risk is that the Municipality or BKV might proceed with&#13;
a major uneconomic investment, thereby undermining financial capacity&#13;
to pursue project and increase self financing. The project includes a&#13;
covenant requiring the Municipality or BKV to demonstrate that all major&#13;
new transport investments have an ERR of at least 10 percent.&#13;

HUNGARY&#13;
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. URBAN TRANSPORT IN BUDAPEST&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1   The evolution of Budapest and its urban transport needs mirrors the transition of the&#13;
Hungarian economy.  In terms of scale, Budapest accounts for about 20 percent of total&#13;
Hungarian population and about 25 percent of all jobs, and therefore its management and&#13;
finances are important national features. With the 1990 Self-Government Act, local governments&#13;
now have clear jurisdiction over local infrastructure and services (including urban roads and&#13;
public transport), together with the requisite fiscal and spending powers. Central government&#13;
allocations to Budapest have been declining as a share of municipal resources to about 50 percent&#13;
in 1994, indicating increasing reliance on local revenue and borrowing. Like the central&#13;
government, Budapest is attempting to pursue policies which fmd the balance between economic&#13;
growth and social development, protect the environment, tailor expenditures to fit available&#13;
resources, and use public funds only when expected benefits exceed costs.&#13;
1.2   One of the most urgent short-term issues facing Budapest is the relative roles of mass&#13;
transport services and the automobile. While mass transport predominates (currently 70 percent&#13;
on a per trip basis), this is now changing as the result of economic restructuring, and the use&#13;
of autos has doubled in the last 10 years. Until recently, mass transport fares were quite low,&#13;
but now cover 34 percent of costs. Low fares and an extensive transit network explain why the&#13;
usage of mass transport in Budapest has been one of the highest in the world. Subsidies to mass&#13;
transport currently account for about 12 percent of the city's budget. Increased street congestion&#13;
negatively affects the services and costs of public transport modes, and generates strong&#13;
pressures for greater spending on road improvements.&#13;
1.3   Budapest is now pursuing a comprehensive approach to the provision, pricing and&#13;
financing of mass transport. It is also Budapest's policy to slow down (and in some cases,&#13;
arrest) the shift toward private cars; on the other hand, recognizing the link between economic&#13;
growth and transport, it will also consider new road projects where justified. It is also the&#13;
Municipality's strategy to both increase cost recovery from passengers and increase the&#13;
efficiency of public transport modes. The Municipality is also committed to increasing the role&#13;
of the market in the urban transport system, including privatization.&#13;
1.4   The Budapest Transport Company (BKV) operates all bus and rail-based public transport&#13;
operations serving the city. It is, by and large, an efficient and relatively well-managed&#13;
company, in the main stream of the European tradition, but burdened with the inheritances of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
a command economy. Its fleet is inefficient and environmentally unsound. BKV is overstaffed&#13;
(particularly in nonoperating departments), and it is relies on in-house capability for functions&#13;
only remotely related to public transport. Starting in 1991, BKV has been using outside&#13;
assistance to diagnose these issues and develop plans for future improvements. It is also the&#13;
beneficiary of a small component (US$4.0 million) of the Second Transport Project (Loan 3032-&#13;
HU, 1989, US$95 million) which has been effectively used to establish a traffic control system.&#13;
The project will complement an ongoing EBRD Urban Transport Project which is being&#13;
effectively implemented.&#13;
B. The City, its Transport System and Institutions&#13;
1.5   With its slightly declining population of about 2 million people, Budapest's economy&#13;
rests, in addition to commerce and administration, on heavy industry (locomotive, bus, and ship&#13;
building), electrical machinery, food processing, and tourism. The River Danube divides the&#13;
city into hilly Buda, with its historic district and lower-density residential developments, and&#13;
Pest, built on a plain with a quasi-grid street pattern. The majority of non residential activities&#13;
in the city occur in Pest. Concentrations of large-scale industrial public enterprises in the&#13;
northern and southern suburbs line the Danube and reflecting the pattern established during the&#13;
command economy system. New, private businesses are cropping up in smaller industrial parks,&#13;
diffused throughout suburban districts. The construction of the outer ring road, now being&#13;
carried out with Bank assistance, will no doubt affect industrial and commercial siting in the near&#13;
future, and it may also reinforce housing developments on the fringes of the urban area. The&#13;
growth of the city has been managed through a series of master plans; the most recent of these&#13;
was adopted in 1988 and it is now being updated. Formerly, master plans were prepared by&#13;
state-owned consulting institutions (UTIBER, UVATERV and others), but these are now&#13;
breaking up and giving way to private consulting firms.&#13;
1.6   The Budapest capital region consists of 22 districts, each with its own locally elected&#13;
mayor and assembly. There is also an umbrella city Government (Municipality), with an elected&#13;
mayor and an assembly of 88 representatives; each district elects one representative, while the&#13;
others are elected in a city wide vote, based on proportional representation. The previous&#13;
Municipal Government was structured as a top-down hierarchy with authority for both planning&#13;
and funding decisions; the new system is based on the 1990 Self-Government Act, which gave&#13;
local Governments clear jurisdiction over local infrastructure and services (including urban roads&#13;
and public transport), together with requisite fiscal and spending powers. In Budapest, the&#13;
districts are responsible for primary and secondary education and some social programs, but the&#13;
Municipality is responsible for public transport services and other area-wide systems (e.g. water&#13;
and gas supply). The ownership of residential real estate was transferred from the state to the&#13;
districts and the Municipality, and a divestiture process is underway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.7   Personal mobility is high at 5.2 million trips per day and so is the share of trips taken&#13;
using motorized modes, at 85 percent. In spite of the recent jump in car ownership, public&#13;
transport still carries an impressive 70 percent of motorized trips. The fundamental approach&#13;
to urban transport in Budapest, as in other capitals of Central/Eastern Europe, has been to give&#13;
a primary role to public transport by providing extensive and frequent service at low fares.&#13;
Budapest's Transport Company, BKV, is a large public-sector enterprise enjoying a virtual&#13;
monopoly in the inner city; it has about 19,000 employees and a multi-modal fleet of about&#13;
3,600 vehicles. Longer-distance commuting and travel needs are served by Hungarian Railways&#13;
(MAV) and the inter-city bus company (VOLANBUSZ), both also public-sector enterprises.&#13;
Private sector activities are limited to taxis and minibuses. Bicycle ownership is relatively high,&#13;
estimated at about 300,000 bicycles, but this mode is still limited to recreational use. Some 10&#13;
km of bike-only routes have been built in Budapest; these are mainly scattered around low-&#13;
density areas, and the Municipality intends to integrate them into a coherent network.&#13;
1.8   The importance of public transport modes notwithstanding, car ownership in Budapest&#13;
was fairly substantial in the past and has recently grown at a considerable rate. Starting at about&#13;
360,000 cars in 1985 (174 cars per 1,000 inhabitants), the fleet rose to about 472,000 in 1990&#13;
and is still growing at some 6-7 percent per annum. The current ownership rate, estimated to&#13;
be around 290 per 1,000 inhabitants, is pushing Budapest into the same category as Western&#13;
European cities such as Berlin (313 cars per 1,000) or Stockholm (249 cars per 1,000&#13;
inhabitants). This growth has not been due to an overall increase in incomes and wealth.&#13;
Rather, the increase in car ownership is based on faster income growth for some social groups,&#13;
primarily the emerging class of private entrepreneurs, as well as to easier access to secondhand&#13;
western cars.&#13;
1.9   Despite the relatively high rate of car ownership, individual transport plays a modest role&#13;
in Budapest. The availability of an excellent public transport system does not alone explain this&#13;
phenomenon, since other constraints on automobile usage exist. The price of gasoline in&#13;
Hungary has traditionally been high, much as elsewhere in Europe. In August 1994, the most&#13;
frequently used 96-octane gasoline cost about HUF88 (US$0.85) per liter and diesel fuel cost&#13;
HUF69 (US$0.66) per liter. The physical layout of Budapest has also restrained the use of&#13;
private cars somewhat, the six Danube bridges are congested at peak hours, very few parking&#13;
garages exist in the central business district and, as a matter of public policy, the Municipality&#13;
has refused to add parking capacity indiscriminately.  On-street pay parking has been&#13;
implemented in limited areas, but this parking policy has been poorly enforced and improper car&#13;
parking interferes with motorized vehicles and pedestrians. Finally, a comprehensive traffic&#13;
management plan is in place in the inner city, on the Pest side of the river, and it will soon be&#13;
extended. It features pedestrian-only streets and squares, a one-way circulation system designed&#13;
to discourage cars from crossing certain areas, linked traffic lights acting as a gate system,&#13;
pedestrian subways, and some off-street car parks, both surface and multi-story types. A similar&#13;
approach has been used in the historic Castle District in Buda, with a strong focus on the&#13;
protection of the natural environment and monuments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.10 The road system of Budapest is extensive, comprising some 2,900 km of paved streets.&#13;
The City spent about US$18 million in 1994 for road and bridge maintenance. Radial roads are&#13;
better developed than ring roads. A single inner-city ring makes use of two out of six Danube&#13;
bridges. Another ring road is in the making along Hungaria Blvd; it crosses the Danube in the&#13;
north along Arpad bridge, but its southern crossing, the proposed Lagymanyos Bridge, is still&#13;
under construction (see Map IBRD 25207R). The outer ring, MO, will be of motorway standard&#13;
and will free Budapest of transit and some suburban traffic; 29 km has already been constructed.&#13;
In addition to building new bridges, developing circular roads, and moving longer-distance&#13;
traffic to new, higher-standard roads, major work will be necessary to eliminate 60 remaining&#13;
railway at-grade crossings.&#13;
C. The Finances of the Municipality of Budapest&#13;
1.11 Details on the financial sources available to the Municipality of Budapest, together with&#13;
a summary of its cash receipts and expenditures for the years 1991 through 1993 and estimates&#13;
for 1994, are shown in Annex 1. The Municipality's income as stated in forints increased by&#13;
32 percent from HUF57 billion to HUF75 billion during the period 1991-94. Inflation caused&#13;
the dollar equivalents to decline from US$740 million in 1991 to US$728 million in 1994. In&#13;
1991, about 71 percent of total revenue was received from the central Government in the form&#13;
of per capita allocations of taxes earnarked for local governments and targeted grants. The&#13;
balance of about 29 percent consisted of local taxes, miscellaneous income collected directly by&#13;
the Municipality, and loans. In 1994 central Government allocations provided about 50 percent&#13;
of the City's resources, local taxes etc. provided about 34 percent and borrowing provided 16&#13;
percent or HUF 14.1 billion (US$137 million). About 41 percent of the Municipality's income&#13;
is earmarked for special programs, e.g. social security payments, road construction, etc. with&#13;
the remaining 59 percent available for expenditure at its own discretion.&#13;
1.12 In 1991, the Municipality spent about HUF48 billion on current operations; this amount&#13;
represented about 87 percent of its total budget. One of the major items of current expenditure&#13;
was the subsidy of HUFlO billion paid to BKV; this represented about 17 percent of the City's&#13;
total budget. Capital expenditure was HUF7 billion, or about 13 percent of the total. There was&#13;
a surplus of the 1991 operations of about 5 percent, or HUF3 billion. For 1994, current and&#13;
other expenditure is estimated to be HUF65 billion, or 73 percent of the total budget, while that&#13;
part of the current expenditure allocated to the BKV subsidy remained at HUFlO billion, which&#13;
now would represent about 12 percent of the total. Capital investment at HUF24 billion is&#13;
expected to account for the remaining 27 percent of expenditures. The Municipality achieved&#13;
a surplus on the combined current and capital account of HUF7.2 billion for the three years&#13;
1991, 1992, and 1993, and broke even in 1994.&#13;
1.13 The Municipality's total borrowing as of 1993 was about HUF7.0 billion. During 1994&#13;
the Municipality signed a Loan Agreement with the EBRD for a loan of US$47 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
equivalent which will be transferred to BKV in the form of a grant or equity contribution. In&#13;
addition to the proposed Bank loan of US$38.0 million, the Municipality proposes to borrow in&#13;
1995 a loan of HUF8.5 billion (US$65 million) for 'Investments of State Importance". The debt&#13;
service on the HUF8.5 billion loan will be financed directly by the Government and BKV will&#13;
finance the debt service on the Bank loan. With the postponement of the Metro investment, no&#13;
major borrowing program by the Municipality is foreseen in the immediate future. The&#13;
Municipality is currently financially viable and the proposed project should enhance this viability&#13;
by reducing the investment and operating support required by BKV. The Municipality agreed&#13;
at negotiations that it will not incur any debt if the estimated debt service for any succeeding&#13;
fiscal year would be more than 15 percent of its cash income for the twelve-month period&#13;
preceding the incurrence of the debt. Loans for which the debt service is financed by other&#13;
agencies will not be included in this calculation unless the debt service is in arrears.&#13;
D. Budapest Transport Company (BKV)&#13;
1. 14 The Budapest Transport Company (BKV) was created in 1968 through unification of bus&#13;
and rail-based operations serving the city, as a monopoly provider of public transport services.&#13;
Its staff and assets still reflect the important function they were performing prior to the economic&#13;
transformation. In 1987, the company had a staff of 24,600 and owned a multimodal fleet of&#13;
about 3,800 vehicles. The deficits created by the policy of low fares were financed through a&#13;
sophisticated system of operating subsidies provided by the City and the Government of&#13;
Hungary. Major cracks in this system appeared when macro-economic constraints made the&#13;
prospect of continuing subsidies (and thus a policy of low cost recovery) less and less feasible&#13;
at their past levels. The first fare increase in BKV's history took place in 1985, the next one&#13;
in 1989, and increases became annual thereafter. Traffic started to fall, because of fare&#13;
increases, increased unemployment, BKV service reductions and rising car ownership and use.&#13;
Starting in 1990, BKV sought outside assistance, financed through the Second Transport project,&#13;
to study its organization and management with a view to reducing costs and improving services.&#13;
The study, completed in 1991, indicated that BKV was obtaining satisfactory levels of&#13;
productivity from vehicles and staff directly involved in operations, but its costs were high due&#13;
to a plethora of staff in other departments (especially in administration) and its involvement in&#13;
activities that had little or nothing to do with transport (eg. construction). BKV's buses were&#13;
neither energy efficient nor environmentally friendly, and some of its rail-based infrastructure&#13;
and fleet used obsolete technologies and needed to be replaced. The study also recommended&#13;
that innovative sources of finance be developed to reduce BKV's reliance on city subsidies.&#13;
1.15 The first multi-party local elections were held in Budapest in 1990 and the Government&#13;
of Hungary started disengaging itself from financing urban services. Currently its only&#13;
remaining direct contribution to BKV's operations is compensation for concessionary fares. In&#13;
December 1991, BKV became a budgetary agency of The City of Budapest, a temporary&#13;
arrangement before its transformation into a city-owned company, operating under commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
law. A national law requires that the transformation process be completed by the end of 1996.&#13;
In the meantime, the City is pressing BKV to reduce its operating costs.  BKV's subsidy&#13;
represented 13.6 percent of the Municipal budget in 1994. The company has undergone two&#13;
management changes between 1991 and 1993 and has implemented a comprehensive&#13;
reorganization scheme. Staff from central departments were redeployed in operational roles, 85&#13;
managerial positions were eliminated, and total staff was reduced from 22,000 permanent and&#13;
2,000 part-time employees to a total of 19,533; the eventual goal is to reach a total of 18,000&#13;
employees by 2000. BKV is also introducing a new accounting system (along EC guidelines)&#13;
and making diverse, low-cost investments to modernize and improve its operations (e.g.&#13;
automatic vehicle monitoring system, energy-supply management, vehicle priority at&#13;
intersections), partly with assistance from the Second Transport Project. There has also been&#13;
some increase in BKV's cost recovery (31 percent from farebox, 3 percent from other activities),&#13;
although it is considered insufficient in view of the burden that BKV represents for the City's&#13;
finances. BKV is further described in Annex 4.&#13;
E. Key Problems and Issues&#13;
1.16 Five issues dominate the urban transport scene in Budapest. The first four involve BKV:&#13;
(a) size of the service network and of the company; (b) fare policy and subsidies in a shrinking&#13;
market; (c) aged and obsolete plant; and (d) formal status of BKV as an enterprise and its&#13;
relationship with the Municipality. The fifth has to do with urban automobile policies.&#13;
1.17 BKV's network design was predicated on intense use of public transport, partly induced&#13;
by very low fares. It also adopted a high level of service, in terms of frequency as well as of&#13;
access to stops, not necessarily based on passenger demand. To support this network, BKV&#13;
developed a very large organization, relying on in-house capability for most functions even&#13;
remotely relevant to public transport.  BKV is burdened by excess administrative staff,&#13;
especially in non operational departments. In a declining demand situation, BKV's network is&#13;
too large and the company is overstaffed. Meanwhile, despite significant fare increases over&#13;
the last five years, the cost-recovery ratio is still low, and BKV's subsidy providers, the&#13;
Hungary Government and the Municipality, are both facing severe budget constraints that&#13;
prevent them from financing BKV at a level allowing proper renewal of its plant. BKV's fleet&#13;
consists mainly of vehicles manufactured in Eastern Europe with high levels of noxious&#13;
emissions, high fuel consumption, and obsolete technology. Furthermore, this fleet is aged, and&#13;
frequent breakdown require a high percentage of spare vehicles, while the poor condition of&#13;
tracks and track structures has brought major disruption to the tram network. The previous&#13;
subsidy formulas were discontinued by the 1991 change of ownership and have been replaced&#13;
by an open-ended subsidy with no incentives to increase productivity. BKV maintains an&#13;
intermediate status that is not scheduled for change until 1996, and the current relationship&#13;
between BKV and the Municipality needs to be improved. The proposed project addresses all&#13;
of these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.18 While the use of public transport services is declining, private car ownership has grown&#13;
significantly, creating congestion and increasing pollution. The central business district (CBD)&#13;
of Budapest was built before the automobile era; its narrow streets cannot accommodate traffic&#13;
flows and parked cars obstruct traffic pedestrians. The resulting congestion has an especially&#13;
negative impact on street-based public transport vehicles and pedestrians. It is essential that the&#13;
existing traffic management activities of the Municipality, which focus on engineering measures,&#13;
be extended to include pricing instruments as well. Congestion management through a rigorous&#13;
parking policy is part of this project.&#13;
Urban Transport Policy&#13;
1.19 The Urban Transport Policy of the Municipality of Budapest is designed to address&#13;
several key issues. The major long-term urban transport policy objectives are to balance&#13;
economic growth and social development measures and to protect the environment. In the short&#13;
term, the City's main concern is how to slow down the loss of paying passengers to private car&#13;
use. At negotiations, the borrower presented a synthesis of the City's Urban Transport Policy&#13;
in a statement which is acceptable to the Bank and is included in Annex 2. The main features&#13;
of the City's policies and action programs include:&#13;
(1)   Actions to improve the financial position and performance of Budapest Transport&#13;
Company (BKV), through a combination of revenue increases, operational&#13;
improvements and cost-reduction measures. Revenues will be increased through&#13;
fare hikes, a new fare system and technology, fare unification to cover all&#13;
metropolitan area operators, and action against fare evasion.  Improved&#13;
performance and reduced costs will be achieved through BKV plant&#13;
modernization, increased priority measures for street-based mass transport&#13;
vehicles, service network rationalization, adjustment of service standards to&#13;
reflect demand, spinning off non operational functions, increased buying from the&#13;
market, and better organization and management.&#13;
(2)   Pilot programs to test the potential of private sector participation in the delivery&#13;
of mass transport services.&#13;
(3)   Actions to restrain vehicular automobile traffic in the inner city through a&#13;
combination of traffic and parking management measures, including a new system&#13;
of parking charges and better enforcement. The parking policy will charge car&#13;
users for parking in the city center but convenient park-and-ride facilities will be&#13;
provided in the outskirts. The introduction of road-user charges will also be&#13;
explored at a later date.&#13;
(4)   Expansion and interconnection of pedestrian zones and a bicycle-lane network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(5)   Selected road development and rehabilitation to eliminate structural weaknesses&#13;
in the arterial network.&#13;
(6)   Revision of the City's land use and transport strategy to reflect new economic and&#13;
social parameters.&#13;
(7)   A comprehensive approach to urban transport finance, making use of new sources&#13;
and modes of finance, including a link between net revenue from parking and&#13;
public transport financing.&#13;
(8)   Improvements in the process of preparing, evaluating, budgeting and&#13;
implementing new transport projects, notably introducing cost-benefit analysis in&#13;
project selection.&#13;
1.20 In addition to the rehabilitation plan for BKV (partly financed by the EBRD and by the&#13;
World Bank), the policy calls for new investments. The main road and bridge construction&#13;
projects are listed in Annex 3.&#13;
1.21 The Municipality has also supported the establishment of a Budapest Transport&#13;
Association (BTA), whose objective is to coordinate the providers of public transport in&#13;
Budapest and to introduce a single-fare system. An agreement defining actions to be taken to&#13;
establish BTA was signed in October 1993 between the Ministry of Transport,&#13;
Telecommunications and Water Management, the Municipality of Budapest, BKV, MAV, and&#13;
Volanbusz. A draft Deed of Association for the BTA has been prepared, and the unified fare&#13;
system is planned to be introduced by January 1, 1997.  At negotiations, the Municipality&#13;
presented their Project Implementation Plan which is acceptable to the Bank (Annex 11),&#13;
including a Municipal Action Plan which defines the steps for improving parking management&#13;
and establishing a Budapest Transport Association.&#13;
F. Bank Projects in the Sector and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.22   The First Transport Project (Loan 2557-HU, 1985, US$75 million) provided assistance&#13;
to railways (MAV), to the roads system, including the construction of a 15 km section of the&#13;
Budapest Ring Road (MO), and to a parastatal trucking company (Hungarocamion). It was&#13;
completed satisfactorily, although the railway's financial performance was less than projected&#13;
due to substantial traffic losses resulting from the economic restructuring. The Second Transport&#13;
Project included follow-up assistance in the same three sectors plus a US$4.0 million component&#13;
for BKV for a traffic control system. The latter was satisfactorily implemented and is now 100&#13;
percent committed and 90 percent disbursed. The road component is close to completion. The&#13;
financial performance of MAV, and to a lesser extent Hungarocamion, deteriorated further&#13;
during implementation of this second project for the same reasons listed above. In February&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1994 an agreement was reached with the Bank on a three-year business plan for MAV and an&#13;
action plan for HC; but the situation is still deteriorating because of a continuing sharp decease&#13;
in traffic and a failed attempt to reduce costs. The Roads Project (Loan 3549-HU, 1993, US$90&#13;
million) was declared effective on December 5, 1993 and is proceeding satisfactorily; the loan&#13;
is more than one-third disbursed.&#13;
1.23 Project Completion Reports have been prepared Bankwide for about 15 urban transport&#13;
projects or urban projects with significant transport components. Physical components were&#13;
generally completed as planned and cost estimates were generally of the right order. All public&#13;
transport companies made operational improvements. Institutional and policy initiatives were&#13;
partly successful. For example, bus fares were successfully increased in Kuala Lumpur and to&#13;
a lesser extent in Bombay and Madras, but not in Calcutta and Ivory Coast due to political&#13;
interference. Past urban transport projects also demonstrate the importance of ensuring that&#13;
there are sufficient funds for maintenance; this in turn depends on increasing cost recovery.&#13;
1.24 The main lessons learned from past Hungarian transport projects are: (a) the impact of&#13;
economic transformation on public transport enterprises has been very large and has exceeded&#13;
earlier expectations -- it must therefore be addressed by a commensurate action plan; (b)&#13;
increased cost recovery is important, and related objectives and timing should be agreed up&#13;
front; (c) training can have a rapid positive impact if it is linked to specific institutional&#13;
objectives and related technical assistance; (d) technical specifications must be prepared early,&#13;
so as not to delay the procurement process. These lessons have been taken into account in the&#13;
design of this project.&#13;
G. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.25 Through early sector work and minor investments in the Second Transport Project, the&#13;
Bank has been instrumental in helping BKV to perceive the need for change and to initiate its&#13;
reorganization and streamlining process. This has already given positive results, including an&#13;
increase in BKV's cost recovery, as discussed above. Other developments which affect public&#13;
transport are taking place in Budapest -- the City Government, which unifies some 22&#13;
municipalities, is in the process of updating its long-term strategy for land use and transport,&#13;
while taking steps to upgrade traffic, parking capacity, and management in the central area.&#13;
1.26 The proposed project is designed to pursue one of the key objectives of our country&#13;
assistance strategy--namely to help raise the efficiency of social and economic infrastructure&#13;
while opening sectors to private sector initiatives. By increasing the commercial orientation of&#13;
a major public transport company and introducing the private provision of services, the project&#13;
would contribute to the larger aims of reducing the public role in the economy as well as to&#13;
pursue economic development in an environmentally sound way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin&#13;
2.1   This Project was identified during the preparation of a possible Third Transport Project,&#13;
which would have included a limited-scope urban transport component, based on the&#13;
recommendations of the BKV Organization and Management Study. Then another study on&#13;
Urban Transport Investment Priorities Study in Budapest was completed. The initial proposal&#13;
was subsequently modified in scope and size to take into account the results of the two studies&#13;
as well as the complementary urban transport project being financed by EBRD.&#13;
B. Project Preparation&#13;
2.2   The Urban Transport Investment Priorities Study analyzed all the proposed urban&#13;
transport projects of the Municipality and screened them according to their priority. It also&#13;
defined alternative urban transport policies. In response to that study, Budapest's Mayor&#13;
indicated that the City will pursue a policy to support public transport with restrictions on car&#13;
access to the central business district (para. 1.20).&#13;
2.3   Those investments that met the three criteria of economic efficiency, urgency, and&#13;
relevance to the City's policy, were then studied in more detail. After further discussion with&#13;
the Municipality, a comprehensive urban transport program was established. In August 1993,&#13;
the EBRD and the Municipality signed a loan to finance the following parts of this program: (a)&#13;
rehabilitation of the 100 year old Millenium Metro Line, which includes waterproofing 1.5 km&#13;
of tunnel, replacement of 2.5 km track, three cross-over sections, and refurbishment of three&#13;
important stations; (b) engine replacement for buses less than six years old to install less-&#13;
polluting, fuel-saving engines; (c) bus fleet renewal for 90 midi buses and 170 articulated buses;&#13;
(d) installation of on-street pay parking; and (e) technical assistance, including: (i) assistance&#13;
with bidding procedures; (ii) assistance with project management; and (iii) guidance on&#13;
institutional issues such as contracting out support activities and restructuring fares.&#13;
C. Objectives&#13;
2.4   The overall objective of the Budapest Urban Transport Project is to support the urban&#13;
transport reforms undertaken by the City of Budapest and BKV. Specific objectives are to: (a)&#13;
modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; (b) implement a parking control&#13;
policy; (c) decrease subsidies to BKV by reducing operating costs, increasing tariffs and&#13;
separating noncore activities, and by introducing the private provision of public transport&#13;
services; (d) contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest; and (e) establish a formal&#13;
contractual relationship between BKV and the City of Budapest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
D. Description&#13;
2.5   The Project comprises three investment components, and one technical Assistance&#13;
component, which will be developed, financed, and implemented by the City of Budapest and&#13;
BKV:&#13;
(a)   Bus fleet replacement&#13;
(b)   Tram track renewal&#13;
(c)   Automatic vehicle monitoring system; and&#13;
(d)   Technical assistance&#13;
Bus Fleet Replacement&#13;
2.6   Buses transport about half of the passenger trips on BKV. In 1993 and 1994, service was&#13;
provided by a fleet of about 1,750 buses, most of which were Ikarus 200-series buses&#13;
manufactured in Hungary. The Ikarus 200-series were not treated to resist corrosion and thus&#13;
their normal body lifespan is only eight years, compared to an average of twelve years for&#13;
Western buses. Financial constraints over the last few years have prevented an appropriate bus&#13;
replacement program and 36 percent of the fleet is now more than eight years old. Moreover,&#13;
most of the buses have D2156 Hungarian-made Raba engines, which are neither environmentally&#13;
friendly nor fuel-efficient. The current fleet composition leads to higher maintenance costs,&#13;
requires a higher percentage of spare buses (23 percent compared to 10-12 percent in Western&#13;
European cities), and causes more air pollution.&#13;
2.7   Fifty single buses will be purchased under the World Bank project. Including the&#13;
additional buses purchased with the EBRD loan, a total of 325 buses will be purchased during&#13;
1994-96. This will allow the replacement of all buses over twelve years old. New buses of&#13;
modern design are expected to last twelve years on average, to be cheaper to maintain, to&#13;
require fewer spare buses (based on international experience), and to consume less fuel.&#13;
Tram Track Renewal&#13;
2.8   Tram transport provides about one-quarter of all public transport trips in Budapest. The&#13;
network is concentrated in the center of the city, including important extensions to the Metro&#13;
system. The track network includes 201 km of big panel surface track which is accessible to&#13;
road vehicles, and 165 km of traditional railway-type open track with stone ballast. About 30&#13;
percent of the network is in good condition. The average age of the tracks is 19 years, and&#13;
some sections are over 40 years old; the recommended average age is about 12 years. The&#13;
technology of big panel track is now considered obsolete; it is subject to water intrusion, which&#13;
creates an inherent weakness at the junctions between panels so that the panels break at these&#13;
junctions, causing irregularities in the rails, which in turn leads to instability and excessive rail&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
wear. These problems are extremely difficult to repair, and big panel track only lasts an average&#13;
of eight years on the most heavily traveled routes.&#13;
2.9   The maintenance and renewal budget for tram track has decreased by more than 50&#13;
percent in real terms over the last five years. Track condition is deteriorating quickly -- speed&#13;
limitation is now required on 14 percent of the network and on some sections, the speed limit&#13;
is only 10 km per hour. BKV plans to replace all big panel track as it wears out with a new&#13;
type of surface track. This new surface track would be constructed with a continuous reinforced&#13;
concrete base with appropriate drainage, heavier rails, and resilient mountings using special&#13;
glues, to allow for some elasticity while preserving adherence. It is expected to last 25 to 30&#13;
years, to be cheaper to maintain, and to be quieter. However, BKV lacks funds to do the work.&#13;
Their budget for maintenance and track renewal declined from a peak US$17.0 million&#13;
equivalent in 1989 to US$7.0 million in 1992 with the result that they were able to renew only&#13;
about 6 km of track in 1992, and only about 5-6 km each year in 1993 and 1994, compared to&#13;
an average annual requirement of around 16 km.&#13;
2.10 Under the project, 47 km of track that is in most urgent need of repair (most of which&#13;
is expected to be big panel track on the most heavily travelled routes) will be replaced over a&#13;
four-year period. The work program will take into account the track condition, the suppression&#13;
of speed limits, and a consistent treatment of each route. BKV proposes to concentrate during&#13;
the first year on the rehabilitation of the Nagykorut, the most heavily traveled section of the&#13;
network (166,000 passengers per day in 1993), which forms part of the inner ring in Budapest.&#13;
2.11 In addition, the tram track renewal component will provide various types of small&#13;
equipment: (a) instruments to diagnose track condition; (b) maintenance machines and tools; and&#13;
(c) computer-controlled maintenance supervision system.&#13;
Automatic Vehicle Monitoring System&#13;
2.12 The Second Transport Project included Stage I of the implementation of an automatic&#13;
vehicle monitoring system. The purpose of the AVM system is to reduce travel time, assure an&#13;
even flow of vehicles, reduce empty runs, improve vehicle utilization, inform passengers waiting&#13;
at stations of vehicle arrival times, and reduce the cost of manual dispatching. The benefits of&#13;
this investment are reductions in the number of vehicles and operating costs required to provide&#13;
a given level of service, reduction in dispatching costs, and the increased attractiveness of the&#13;
service. Stage I implemented the basic infrastructure needed for the system and also provided&#13;
on board equipment sufficient for 250 vehicles. Stage II will provide on board equipment for&#13;
200 additional vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Technical Assistance - Institutional Development&#13;
2.13 Technical assistance financed under this project is entirely aimed towards institutional&#13;
development. It will include studies, some hardware and software, and local and foreign&#13;
training. Six themes are defined:&#13;
(a)   Financial Management. The project will provide funds to meet the costs of a&#13;
review by outside consultants of BKV's financial, cost-accounting, and data-&#13;
processing systems, and will provide technical assistance for their development.&#13;
(b)   Management Information System and Computerization. The objective is to&#13;
develop an integrated Management Information System to provide appropriate&#13;
training, and to procure hardware and software.&#13;
(c)   Marketing and Public relations. The objective is to improve BKV's marketing&#13;
activities. This will be achieved through study tours in selected foreign countries,&#13;
seminars in Hungary, and consultant services related to setting up the Budapest&#13;
Transport Association.&#13;
(d)   Management and Organization. To follow up the Organization and Management&#13;
study done under the Second Transport project, courses will be organized in&#13;
Hungary to improve BKV's understanding of modern management methods for&#13;
a commercialized public transport company operating in a market economy.&#13;
(e)   Technical Improvement. The objective is to improve technical knowledge for&#13;
maintenance of rolling stock and infrastructure, and to investigate traffic&#13;
management techniques designed to give priority to public transport vehicles.&#13;
This objective will be achieved through study tours abroad and seminars in&#13;
Hungary.&#13;
(f)   Economic Training. The objective is to train economists in BKV and in the&#13;
Municipality to perform analysis for transport projects. Various courses on&#13;
transport economics and its application to infrastructure planning will be&#13;
organized in Hungary.&#13;
E. Policy requirements&#13;
2.14 In the framework of the project, the City of Budapest will develop and implement policies&#13;
covering:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(a)   Parking pricing and availability, to restrain parking in the downtown area&#13;
and provide park-and-ride facilities in the outskirts;&#13;
(b)   The relationship between BKV and the City of Budapest;&#13;
(c)   Separation of BKV's noncore activities, in order to privatize or terminate&#13;
them, and contracting out all construction work of BKV;&#13;
(d)   Introduction of private provision of public transport on a trial basis; and&#13;
(e)   Better cost recovery for BKV, through an appropriate mixture of cost&#13;
savings, reduction of fare evasion, and fare increases.&#13;
Parking Policy&#13;
2.15 Parking control in Budapest is very weak. As a result, cars park in any available space&#13;
on both sides of the street, leaving little room for pedestrians and creating a safety hazard. Very&#13;
little on-street pay parking exists. This situation encourages drivers to use cars in the central&#13;
business district and increases congestion and pollution.&#13;
2.16 The Municipality has prepared a comprehensive parking plan, which includes: (a) the&#13;
creation of areas where driving is restricted to authorized cars; (b) the installation of on-street&#13;
pay parking with appropriate pricing and appropriate enforcement in the city center; and (c) the&#13;
creation of park-and-ride facilities on the outskirts of the city. The hourly parking fee for a&#13;
private car will vary from HUF20 in the outer part of the city's center, to HUF80 (almost a&#13;
dollar) in the inner most part. The possibility of combined park-and-ride and public transport&#13;
tickets will be explored.&#13;
2.17 The ability of the parking-management plan to actually discourage car access to the city's&#13;
center will mainly depend on its enforcement. According to the current law, towing is restricted&#13;
to cars actually obstructing traffic flows and cannot be used to ensure proper payment of parking&#13;
fees. Because it is difficult to track down car owners from the license plate numbers, the&#13;
proposal features devices preventing a car's removal, such as wheel clamping, as the main&#13;
enforcement measure.   Significant fines, as high as HUF10,000, will result from non&#13;
compliance. The municipal plan was approved by the General Assembly of Budapest, before&#13;
being submitted to each District Assembly to define more precisely the location of the park-and-&#13;
ride facilities and of the on-street pay parking areas (see also Attachment 3 to Annex 11).&#13;
Service and Performance Agreement between the Municipality and BKV&#13;
2.18 BKV is now a municipal enterprise. In the past, BKV's objectives were not precisely&#13;
defined by the Municipality and BKV did not always get appropriate support for improving its&#13;
efficiency. On the other hand, the Municipality complained about a certain lack of transparency&#13;
in BKV's operations. To remedy these problems, the two parties have agreed on some overall&#13;
policy objectives and immediate operational targets, which are set out in three separate&#13;
documents:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(a)   A formal agreement, signed by the Municipality and the General Manager of&#13;
BKV, which establishes general principles for the relation between BKV and its&#13;
owner, specifies BKV's mission, and defines the process for setting up annual (or&#13;
otherwise) objectives, parameter selection, reporting and evaluation.&#13;
(b)   An annual performance plan, to be prepared by BKV, which will contain its&#13;
specific short-term strategy, anticipated constraints, operational and financial&#13;
objectives, performance criteria and targets, studies, completed investments,&#13;
investments in progress and/or preparation, and actions sought by BKV from the&#13;
Municipality. This report would also include an indicative forecast of BKV's&#13;
operational and financial results for the next four years.&#13;
(c)   An annual report, which will show the progress (or otherwise) made relative to&#13;
the objectives and targets set in the preceding year's performance plan, and&#13;
containing at least five years' worth of operational and financial statistics, to put&#13;
the preceding year's achievements in perspective.&#13;
2.19  The formal agreement was signed by BKV and the Municipality in January 1995. The&#13;
targets of the first annual performance plan are included in the BKV action plan which is&#13;
included in the Project Implementation Plan (Attachment 4 of Annex 11).&#13;
Separation of Noncore Activities&#13;
2.20 BKV carries out many activities that have little or no connection with public transport,&#13;
such as construction, telecommunications, and river and tourist transport services.  Such&#13;
activities have an impact on BKV's overhead and would be more efficiently performed by the&#13;
private sector. BKV agreed to an action plan at negotiations which includes the separation of&#13;
these noncore activities from BKV. The Municipality will be their temporary owner and will&#13;
decide whether to privatize or to terminate them. A list of these activities and the number of&#13;
staff involved in each of them is found in Annex 4. A commercialization study, financed by the&#13;
EBRD, is underway to define more precisely the type and timing of the separation.&#13;
2.21 Parallel to this action, contracting out should become standard practice. BKV has already&#13;
taken significant steps in that direction.  Since 1992, BKV has contracted out all track&#13;
construction, and all the track work financed by the project will be awarded through ICB, which&#13;
will further develop BKV's capability in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
Introduction of Private Provision of Publc Transport&#13;
2.22  Except for taxis, public tnsport in Budapest is run by public companies. On less-&#13;
travelled routes, where minibuses provide enough capacity to meet demand, private-sector&#13;
operation could prove less costly than public operation. The 1991 Hungarian concession law,&#13;
provides the legal framework for private operations; section 1, (1), m refers to "passenger&#13;
transport by road, running to schedule' as one of the cases where the law applies. The law&#13;
specifies that private provision of that type of service is possible under a concession regime,&#13;
following a competitive tendering process described in the law. The Municipality has expressed&#13;
its intrest in introducing private operations on a trial basis. At negotiations, it was agreed that&#13;
by December 31, 1996, the Municipality will either award at least two transport routes operated&#13;
by BKV to privately owned operators, or have regular passenger services operated by BKV&#13;
subcontracted through competitive tender so as to reduce BKV's bus fleet requirement by at least&#13;
5 percent.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
2.23 Subsidies to BKV are a heavy burden on the Municipality's finances. Moreover, BKV's&#13;
lack of resources mcreases its vulnerability to budget reduction. In recent years, this has&#13;
resulted in a less than adequate replacement of obsolete vehicles and equipment.  At&#13;
negotiadons, it was agreed that BKV will achieve cost recovery rates not lower than 37 percent&#13;
in 1995, 41 percent in 1996, 43 permcnt in 1997, 45 percent in 1998, 47 percent in 1999 and 50&#13;
percent in 2000 and thereafter. These levels would be reached by a combination of fare and&#13;
other revenue increases, the reduction of fare evasion, and operating-cost decreases. The&#13;
investment component of the project wiUl contribute to the operating-cost decrease by reducing&#13;
maintenance costs and fuel consumption.&#13;
F. Costs&#13;
2.24 The project is esimated to cost US$67.1 million, including US$38 million in foreign&#13;
costs and US$29.1 million in local costs. Local costs exclude VAT but include other taxes. The&#13;
cost estimate is shown in Table 2.1.&#13;

2.26 The Municipality would make available project funds to BKV (except small amounts&#13;
required for training municipal staff) in accordance with an agreement whereby the Municipality&#13;
would make available part of the proceeds of the loan to BKV, and BKV would provide&#13;
sufficient funds to the Municipality to service the loan. Signature of the agreement will be a&#13;
condition of project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Responsibilities&#13;
3.1   The City of Budapest will be the Borrower. The City is the sole owner of BKV and has&#13;
all legal authority over urban transport, including fare levels and service definition. Moreover,&#13;
it is creditworthy (para. 1.14). It will be responsible for developing and implementing the policy&#13;
requirements of the project. For parking, legal responsibility is shared with the 22 districts, but&#13;
the Municipality has a coordinating role that is essential to maintain consistency.  The&#13;
Municipality will make project funds available to BKV in accordance with a "Special&#13;
Agreement" (para. 2.26).&#13;
3.2   BKV will be responsible for implementing all aspects of the project except for matters&#13;
of municipal policy and the training program, which will be implemented by the City of&#13;
Budapest. The borrower presented a Project Implementation Plan which is acceptable to the&#13;
Bank at negotiations, and is shown in Annex 11. BKV will be responsible for the preparation&#13;
of bidding documents, supplier prequalification, bid evaluation, and contract signature in addition&#13;
to normal supervision. BKV has been the implementing agency in the Second Transport Project&#13;
and has become familiar with Bank procedures. Nevertheless, this project is significantly&#13;
bigger and more complex. BKV will need technical assistance to implement it, especially with&#13;
regard to procurement.&#13;
3.3   To streamline the preparation and execution of the project, the Municipality of Budapest&#13;
will make use of the already functioning Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU will: (a)&#13;
prepare detailed work schedules to plan out phasing, critical activities, and responsibilities; (b)&#13;
coordinate the project activities; and (ci) prepare progress reports. The PIU is attached to the&#13;
Mayor's office and includes representatives of the Municipality of Budapest technical experts&#13;
drawn from the tramway and bus operation departments of BKV. The PIU also handles the&#13;
ongoing EBRD Urban Transport Project. An organization chart of the PIU is shown in Annex&#13;
11.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.4   The project is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1999. The loan closing date&#13;
would be June 30, 2000, to allow sufficient time for the release of security deposits on supply&#13;
contracts where performance guarantees are specified, and for effecting final payments for civil&#13;
work's contracts. The project implementation schedule was agreed at negotiations as part of the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (para 2.19).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
C. Environmental Impact of Construction&#13;
3.5   During reconstruction of the tram tracks, the local inhabitants will mainly suffer from&#13;
noise, dust, and traffic detours. For its current tram track renewal operations, BKV reduces the&#13;
impact of these inconveniences by limiting working hours on the work site, by keeping the site&#13;
as clean as possible, and by providing appropriate advance information to the surrounding&#13;
neighborhood.&#13;
3.6   Disposal of waste material from the work site will be handled in the following manner:&#13;
(a)   Stones coming from reconstructed open tram track will be sorted. The non-&#13;
polluted stones will be sold to municipalities to use in road construction. The&#13;
polluted stones will be sent to a special disposal site for hazardous waste.&#13;
(b)   Wood from the tram track renewal will be sold for buming.&#13;
(c)   Concrete from the big panels will be used for low-traffic roads such as work-site&#13;
access roads, by turning them over so that traffic rides on their flat side.&#13;
(d)   Tracks will be melted, recast, and reused.&#13;
(e)   Other materials, such as excess earth, will be used as landfill.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
3.7   Details on procurement are presented in Annex 11, Attachment 7. The procurement of&#13;
the 50 buses will be done through Intemational Competitive Bidding. The total cost of the&#13;
component is US$8.8 million. A single bid has been envisaged. The Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents will be used for this component. A 15 percent domestic preference will apply to&#13;
qualifying goods, in accordance with paras. 2 and 4 of Appendix 2 of the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (1992 version).&#13;
3.8   Tram track renewal will also be procured through ICB. The Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents for small works will be used. This is expected to be implemented successfully&#13;
because some tram track construction has already been contracted out in Budapest, a fairly good&#13;
private construction industry exists in Hungary, and previous World Bank loans have&#13;
familiarized these contractors with ICB.&#13;
3.9  It was agreed that track renewal works will be grouped into three packages, the first&#13;
referring to 1995-96 works, the second to 1996-97 works, and the third to 1997-98 works. The&#13;
various elements of each package will be grouped into two or three bids. This combination of&#13;
bid sizes will encourage local contractors and medium-size contractors in neighboring countries&#13;
to bid, while at the same time offering the option to bid on several contracts together in order&#13;
to attract large foreign contractors and encourage quantity discounts on materials. The technical&#13;
consistency of the work will be maintained by not splitting a tram line into different contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The contract size will range from about US$6 million to about US$20 million, for a total cost&#13;
of US$50.1 million.&#13;
3.10 Contracts for track-measuring instruments, small machines and tools, and maintenance&#13;
supervision equipment will be grouped into packages of less than US$500,000 each (total&#13;
aggregate amount US$2.7 million), and will be awarded through International Shopping by&#13;
obtaining at least three quotations from three different countries. The installation of this&#13;
equipment is not financed by the Bank and will be procured under Local Competitive Bidding.&#13;
3.11 The automatic vehicle monitoring system is the second phase of an ongoing project. The&#13;
second phase will use the same technical specifications as did the first phase. Due to the small&#13;
number of manufacturers of such systems, the AVM system will be procured by Limited&#13;
International Bidding. The installation of the system is not financed by the Bank and will be&#13;
procured under Local Competitive Bidding. The total cost of this component is US$3.4 million.&#13;
3.12 All consultants' services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines. The main&#13;
tasks will be: (a) a review of BKV's financial, cost-accounting, and data processing systems, and&#13;
provision of technical assistance for their development, (Terms of Reference for the review of&#13;
BKV's management are attached in Annex 12); (b) limited expert help for setting up the&#13;
Budapest Transport Association; and (c) separate small contracts for the organization of the&#13;
training program. The training program was agreed at negotiations (Annex 11,&#13;
Attachment 1).&#13;
3.13 All works contracts of more than US$3 million, all procurement packages for goods of&#13;
more than US$500,000, the services of consulting firms costing more than US$100,000 and&#13;
individual consultant services will be subject to prior review. This will account for about 95&#13;
percent of the value of contracts. Other contracts for goods and services will be subject to post&#13;
review.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
E. Disbursements, Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.14  Disbursements will cover:&#13;
(a)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) for buses, track-measuring instruments, maintenance machines and tools,&#13;
the maintenance supervision system, and the automatic vehicle monitoring system;&#13;
(b)   54 percent of contracts (net of VAT) for tram track renewal;&#13;
(c)   100 percent of technical assistance.&#13;
3.15    Disbursements against contracts for goods and services valued at US$500,000 or less&#13;
and for works valued at US$3.0 million or less, would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOE).  Documents to support expenditure financed under SOE would be&#13;
maintained by the Borrower in one location and made available upon request for review by Bank&#13;
representatives, in addition to being audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank.  During&#13;
negotiations, agreements were obtained on all these arrangements.&#13;
3.16 To maintain an adequate flow of funds for eligible project expenditures, with a minimum&#13;
of administrative delay, the Borrower will establish a Special Account (revolving fund) at a bank&#13;
of its choice, sufficient to cover up to about four months of loan expenditures. During the early&#13;
stages of the project, the authorized allocation of the Special Account would be limited to&#13;
US$2.0 million equivalent. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the loan have&#13;
reached US$7.0 million equivalent, the authorized allocation would be increased to US$3.0&#13;
million equivalent. Records of the Special Account proceeds and outlays would be available for&#13;
review by the Bank's supervision missions and subject to annual audit. During negotiations,&#13;
confirnation was obtained of the foregoing arrangements.&#13;
3.17  Based on the loan becoming effective in 1995, a schedule of estimated disbursements was&#13;
established. This scheduled was discussed and confirmed during negotiations.&#13;
3.18  BKV will establish and maintain project related accounts.  Such accounts will be&#13;
maintained in accordance with recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. BKV will provide quarterly financial reports and annual financial statements to reflect&#13;
the financial performance and the position of both BKV and the project, starting from the&#13;
beginning of project execution. An auditor's opinion and report on these statements that is&#13;

4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
4.1   Accounting and audit practices in Hungary have undergone undergoing major changes&#13;
during the past few years to bring the procedures and systems in line with generally accepted&#13;
accounting and audit practices. The conversion of the socialist accounting system to the Western&#13;
accounting format, combined with changes in the system that have been implemented in recent&#13;
years, have resulted in a lack of uniformity in the accounts. These problems have been&#13;
compounded by a severe shortage of experienced, qualified accountants and auditors. As a&#13;
result, the financial accounts should be interpreted with caution.&#13;
B. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.2   Accounting in Hungary must conform to government guidelines. Many changes in these&#13;
guidelines have been recently introduced. In particular, in 1992 the classification of fixed assets&#13;
was revised so that the cost of major equipment maintenance done in a company's own facilities&#13;
was transferred from current expenditures to capital expenditures. This resulted in a 6 percent&#13;
increase in BKV's gross fixed asset value and a 6 percent increase in the capitalization of the&#13;
cost of major repairs, which then represented from 12 percent to 15 percent per annum of&#13;
BKV's working expenses for the three years 1992-94. On the other hand, the depreciation rate&#13;
for buses was increased from 15 percent to 20 percent which appears very high, even taking into&#13;
account the quality of the fleet. Over 50 percent of BKV's vehicle fleet in operation in 1993&#13;
was fully depreciated, indicating substantial hidden reserves. As a result of the major changes&#13;
in the government's 1992 accounting guidelines, and a significant loss of senior accounting staff,&#13;
BKV had difficulties in finalizing its accounts in 1992 and 1993. This resulted in a disclaimer&#13;
in the auditor's reports in 1992 and 1993. BKV has worked closely with the auditors in&#13;
resolving these problems. The auditor has indicated that all major difficulties were satisfactorily&#13;
addressed as of November 1994. No major reservations are expected in the 1994 audit which&#13;
is presently underway.&#13;
4.3   BKV uses a computerized accounting system that runs on an obsolete mainframe&#13;
computer and about 600 separate PCs. The various subsystems were developed in COBOL and&#13;
are not integrated. Data for wages are collected from 400 locations on floppy disks and&#13;
forwarded to the computer center. Inventory data from about 100 warehouses are collected in&#13;
a similar fashion. Problems associated with the system result in a two-month delay in providing&#13;
periodic reports. BKV has a basic financial accounting system but lacks detailed management-&#13;
accounting information such as revenue per route and cost data that would allow them to&#13;
determine route profitability. BKV is aware of the inadequacies and has recently engaged&#13;
consultants to review their existing financial and management accounting procedures and to make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
recommendations for updating the system. These consultants will also review and evaluate&#13;
BKV's data processing system and assist in establishing a strategic information plan that will be&#13;
implemented over the next three to five years (Annex 12).&#13;
C. Past Flnancial Performance&#13;
4.4   The income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets in current prices for&#13;
BKV for the four years 1991 through 1994 are shown in the Annexes 7 through 9. During the&#13;
three years ending December 1994, BKV's revenue (excluding subsidies) increased by about 44&#13;
percent to HUF9.5 billion, and total revenue (including subsidies) increased 37 percent to&#13;
HUF26.5 billion. During the same period, total operating expenses increased 40 percent to&#13;
HUF27.5 billion. This resulted in BKV's net operating deficit increasing twofold from HUFO.3&#13;
billion in 1991 to HUF1.0 billion in 1994. The 1992 modification in accounting practices (see&#13;
para. 4.2) was an important factor in these changes. The income statements for the four years&#13;
1991 through 1994, adjusted to December 1994 price levels to allow for inflation of about 150&#13;
percent, show that revenue (excluding subsidies) decreased by 25 percent and total revenue&#13;
decreased by 29 percent in real terms. Total operating expenses also decreased by 28 percent&#13;
in real terms, but salaries and wages decreased by only 9 percent. This represents a significant&#13;
increase in relative labor costs during the period. BKV's operational efficiency increased&#13;
marginally during the three year period but this was offset by a reduction in the level of&#13;
subsidies.&#13;
4.5   BKV's operating ratios (including subsidies) during the four-year period 1991-94 ranged&#13;
from 100 percent to 104 percent with an overall average for the period of 102 percent. This&#13;
compares to a requirement under the Second Transport Loan for an operating ratio of 98&#13;
percent. BKV's operating ratio excluding central and local Government subsidies remained&#13;
constant at about 300 percent. BKV's cost-recovery ratio from passenger and other income&#13;
averaged 33 percent during the period. Under the Second Transport project, the Government&#13;
agreed to reduce subsidies to the transport sector by 10 percent per annum in real terms, based&#13;
on the 1987 subsidy level, for the years 1989-93. This target was achieved in the case of BKV&#13;
during the five-year period. Overall, BKV's compliance with the financial covenants of the&#13;
Second Transport project was satisfactory, given the major economic changes taking place during&#13;
the period.&#13;
4.6   During the four-year period 1991-94, BKV's net internal cash generation totaled&#13;
HUF12. 1 billion. This amount was sufficient to finance BKV's investment program of HUF1 1.0&#13;
billion. The levels of debt service and borrowing were not significant. In 1991 the Government&#13;
transferred to BKV, in the form of an equity contribution, investments of about HUF6.2 billion&#13;
to cover an extension of the Metro system. In addition, the changes in accounting regulations&#13;
in 1992 increased the value of fixed assets by HUF3.3 billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4.7   During the three-year period ending in 1994, BKV's net fixed assets remained constant&#13;
at about HUF36.0 billion. BKV's own investment was about 24 percent less than the level of&#13;
depreciation. However, the Government's transfer and a revaluation of fixed assets (para. 4.6)&#13;
made up for the low level of BKV's investment. BKV's long-term debt is insignificant at&#13;
HUFO.2 billion. The value of its equity is substantial at HUF44.4 billion (US$370 million) as&#13;
of December 31, 1994. There are no problems with collection of accounts receivable. BKV's&#13;
rate of return on average net fixed assets was insignificant over the four-year period at -0.6&#13;
percent.&#13;
D. Subsidies&#13;
4.8 BKV receives subsidies from both the central and local Governments. The Government&#13;
of Hungary provides subsidies for discounted tickets issued by BKV to students, pensioners, and&#13;
other social groups. These tickets are sold by BKV at 25 percent of the standard price and the&#13;
Government pays the remaining 75 percent. This subsidy is based on the number of monthly&#13;
discounted tickets sold and therefore represents a payment for public service obligation. It&#13;
accounted for about 22 percent of BKV's revenue in 1994. The subsidy paid by the&#13;
Municipality was originally intended as a payment for the repair and maintenance of fixed assets&#13;
but now is based on BKV's projected deficit. This subsidy represented about 47 percent of&#13;
BKV's revenue and 12 percent of the Municipality's revenue in 1994.&#13;
E. Fare Evasion&#13;
4.9   Based on a sample inspection of vehicles, the percentage of passengers without tickets&#13;
on BKV's services was estimated at about 12 percent in 1993. To address this problem, BKV&#13;
increased their control staff by 100 percent during 1993, and introduced an incentive bonus&#13;
scheme. Monthly receipts from penalties increased by 91 percent in December 1993, and by&#13;
115 percent in December 1994, both compared to January 1993. In addition, BKV introduced&#13;
a discount for 'on the spot" payments, resulting in a six-fold increase in these payments between&#13;
January and December 1993. It was agreed at negotiations that BKV will implement an action&#13;
plan, acceptable to the Bank, which includes measures (improved definition of fare evasion,&#13;
additional control staff, incentive schemes and training, as explained in Annex 11) to reduce fare&#13;
evasion to 7 percent of gross receipts from fares during 1997 and thereafter.&#13;
F. Forecast Financial Performance&#13;
4.10 Given the past high levels of inflation in Hungary, it is very difficult to predict future&#13;
inflation levels within a reasonable degree of accuracy during the next few years. All the&#13;
financial forecasts have therefore been prepared in constant mid-1994 forints. This assumes that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
tariff levels in the future will be increased in line with inflation, in addition to any real tariff&#13;
increases required. The exchange rate of mid-1994 of HUF103.0 to the US dollar was used for&#13;
conversion of foreign-exchange costs and the Bank's loan to forints.&#13;
4.11 The forecast financial statements for BKV for the six-year period 1995-2000 are shown&#13;
in Annexes 7 through 9. The estimates for 1994 are in current forints and are based on the&#13;
preliminary results for the year. In view of the current fiscal problems of central and local&#13;
government authorities in Hungary, a major objective of the proposed project is to improve&#13;
BKV's cost-recovery rate in order to transfer a higher proportion of costs to the users, in line&#13;
with a free-market economy. To offset this improvement in receipts from passengers, the level&#13;
of municipal subsidies will decrease. In preparing the financial projections, BKV's cost&#13;
recovery was forecast to increase in steps from the 34 percent achieved in 1994 to 37 percent&#13;
in 1995 and 50 percent in 2000. In addition, it was assumed that as a result of increases in&#13;
automobile use, and higher tariffs, traffic would decline at 4 percent per annum. Conservative&#13;
assumptions were made on the benefits to be secured from the purchase of new vehicles, on the&#13;
reduction in staff and fleet due to increased vehicle reliability, on increased productivity and on&#13;
any reduction in service level due to the fall in traffic. Details of the assumptions used are given&#13;
in Annex 6.&#13;
4.12 Revenue from passenger sales is projected to increase from HUF8.4 billion (US$81&#13;
million) in 1993 to HUF11.8 billion (US$115 million) in 2000. To achieve this increase, tariffs&#13;
were projected to increase in real terms by about 52 percent. To limit the impact of this&#13;
increase on customers, the period for its implementation has been extended for two years beyond&#13;
the project implementation period. During the six-year period, subsidies are projected to&#13;
decrease by 23 percent from HUF17.0 billion (US$165 million) in 1994 to HUF13.1 billion&#13;
(US$127 million) in 2000.&#13;
4.13 Operating expenses are projected to decrease by about 8 percent based on the&#13;
conservative assumptions used. Substantial further decreases in operating expenses could be&#13;
achieved through an aggressive reduction in administrative and other non operative staff and by&#13;
the selective restructuring of services based on the profitability of each route. Experience has&#13;
shown, however, that it is difficult to achieve pro-rata operating cost reductions in parallel with&#13;
reductions in service. Depreciation is forecast to increase by 28 percent, reflecting the higher&#13;
cost of new vehicles and the increased level of investments. Interest charges are insignificant,&#13;
as BKV will only be responsible for debt service on the Bank loan. BKV's operating ratio,&#13;
including subsidies, will be maintained at 100 percent during the period.&#13;
4.14 To ensure the financial viability of BKV and to improve cost recovery, agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that BKV will achieve cost-recovery rates not lower than 37 percent&#13;
in 1995, 41 percent in 1996, 43 percent in 1997, 45 percent in 1998, 47 percent in 1999 and 50&#13;
percent for 2000 onwards. For the purposes of the cost-recovery rate, depreciation charges are&#13;
included in costs but interest on long-term loans is excluded. During negotiations, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Municipality agreed to propose at its General Assembly, tariff increases necessary to enable&#13;
BKV to achieve its cost-recovery objectives, and to provide sufficient funds to enable BKV to&#13;
achieve an operating ratio of 100 percent in 1995 and thereafter. BKV's financing plan for its&#13;
investments during the project period is as follows:&#13;

- 30 -&#13;
4.15  BKV is forecast to generate HUF19.3 billion (US$187 million) during the four-year&#13;
project period. After debt service of HUFO.7 billion (US$6.5 million), the net internal cash&#13;
generation of HUF18.6 billion (US$181 million) will finance about 68 percent of BKV's&#13;
financial requirements. The Bank loan will finance about 60 percent of the project cost, or 14&#13;
percent of BKV's total requirement. The balance of BKV's financial requirement, which is&#13;
HUF4.8 billion, will be provided by a loan to the Municipality from the EBRD that is already&#13;
approved. The project costs represent about 23 percent of BKV's total financial requirements.&#13;
BKV's debt service coverage in 1998 is about 17.0, which is very satisfactory. During&#13;
negotiations, BKV agreed to maintain a debt-service coverage of not less than 1.5.&#13;
4.16  BKV's gross fixed assets are projected to increase by about 36 percent to HUF95.8&#13;
billion (US$930 million) and net fixed assets are expected to increase by about 16 percent during&#13;
the project period. The long-term debt is insignificant. BKV therefore has substantial potential&#13;
for future borrowing and should be in a position to meet normal investment requirements without&#13;
assistance from the Municipality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. General&#13;
5.1   Budapest will make important institutional improvements under the project.  These&#13;
include implementing a parking management scheme, improving the coordination of urban&#13;
transport services, introducing private transport services on a trial basis, and improving&#13;
investment selection. BKV will also increase its cost recovery, reduce fare evasion, improve&#13;
operational performance, separate noncore activities, and contract out additional construction and&#13;
maintenance activities. These improvements are expected to significantly contribute to reducing&#13;
the cost of public and private transportation in Budapest, and thereby increase real incomes.&#13;
However, it is difficult to quantify their benefits reliably. Project benefits were therefore&#13;
quantified on the basis of the expected reductions in future capital and operating costs resulting&#13;
from the investments in buses, track renewal, and the vehicle operating system to be financed&#13;
under the project. The project is also expected to generate environmental benefits which are&#13;
described, but not quantified, below. This approach significantly understates the economic&#13;
return for the project.&#13;
B. Traffic&#13;
5.2   The population of Budapest, currently around 2.0 million persons, is expected to decline&#13;
by about 2.0 percent by 2000, mostly due to the growth of the suburbs. Budapest generated&#13;
around 3.3 million internal and external public transport trips and 1.2 million private car trips&#13;
in 1991, the most recent data available. Budapest is highly public transport intensive, generating&#13;
about 1.70 trips per person per day, compared to 0.51 for representative cities in the United&#13;
Kingdom, 0.33 in France and 0.57 in Spain. Car ownership in Budapest was estimated to be&#13;
260 cars per 1,000 population in 1991, growing at a rate of 6.6 percent per annum since 1986,&#13;
and to have reached about 290 cars per 1,000 population in 1994. Car ownership is forecast to&#13;
increase at a more moderate 3.4 percent per annum to 345 cars per 1,000 population by the year&#13;
2000, consistent with the declining rate of growth experienced in other European countries. It&#13;
is also expected that the kilometers driven per car would increase some 50 percent by the year&#13;
2000 to a level more typical of Western Europe (presently about 9,700 km per annum compared,&#13;
for example, to 14,000 km per annum in the United Kingdom).&#13;
5.3   The above factors are expected to reduce the number of public transport trips irrespective&#13;
of policy changes. However, Budapest is also adopting more commercially oriented transport&#13;
policies which will affect demand. In particular, the city is carrying out a program to increase&#13;
real transport fares by around 80 percent between 1991 and 2000. It is estimated that the&#13;
elasticity of public-transport trips with respect to fares is -0.3, a typical response in other cities,&#13;
resulting in a 19 percent decline in public transport trips independent of other factors. However,&#13;
only about 20 percent of the mostly short trips deterred from taking public transport are expected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
to result in extra car trips, the remainder being substituted by walking, combining trips, trip&#13;
suppression, or higher car occupancy. This is expected to be an economic benefit for Budapest&#13;
since the small loss in convenience will be more than offset by savings in the cost of providing&#13;
public transport. Parking restraint measures to be implemented under the project are expected&#13;
to reduce private car traffic levels in the central business district, particularly on radial routes&#13;
during the peak hour. However, the effect on aggregate public transport trips is likely to be&#13;
relatively small. Finally, it is expected that BKV would rationalize its level of service to adjust&#13;
to the decrease in traffic, resulting in a further small decline in public transport patronage. It&#13;
is expected that the combined effect of all these factors will lead to a 30 percent decline in public&#13;
transport trips between 1991 and 2000 (4.0 percent per annum). It is also expected that private&#13;
car trips will increase 53 percent during this period (+4.8 percent per annum). Under this&#13;
scenario, the ratio of public transport to private car trips would decline from around 80:20 in&#13;
1991 to 56:44 by 2000, closer to the ratio experienced in other European countries. For&#13;
purposes of project analysis, it was assumed that the number of public transport trips would&#13;
remain constant after 2000.&#13;
C. Cost-Benerit Analysis&#13;
5.4   The bus component of the project was evaluated by comparing the capital, maintenance,&#13;
and fuel costs of the bus fleet with and without the project, taking into account the traffic&#13;
forecast, and the planned procurement of additional buses by BKV. The bus component is&#13;
estimated to have an economic rate of return (ERR) of 17 percent as calculated in Annex 10.&#13;
5.5   Under the project, BKV would rehabilitate the most heavily trafficked 47 km of track in&#13;
the worst condition.  This component was evaluated by comparing the capital, track-&#13;
maintenance and tram operating costs of new surface track under forecast traffic loadings, with&#13;
the costs of continuing to use the existing big panel track, as described in Annex 10. BKV&#13;
proposes to concentrate during the first year on the rehabilitation of the 14.6 km Nagykorut, the&#13;
most heavily traveled section of the network (166,000 passengers per day in 1993), which forms&#13;
part of the inner ring in Budapest. This section is estimated to have an ERR of 51 percent. It&#13;
is also estimated that any section carrying a minimum of 30,000 ppd, or 17,000 axles per week&#13;
including sections near depots with numerous trams but fewer passengers, would yield an ERR&#13;
of at least 10 percent. The track renewal component is estimated to have an ERR of 23 percent,&#13;
as shown in Annex 10.&#13;
5.6   The project also includes the extension of the automatic vehicle monitoring (AVM)&#13;
system to cover an additional 200 vehicles. This component is estimated to have an ERR of 19&#13;
percent, as described in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
D. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.7   The project is also expected to have environmental benefits which were not taken into&#13;
account in the economic evaluation. About 50 percent of Budapest's air pollution, including 90&#13;
percent of its lead emissions, is attributable to the transport sector, and 10 percent of the total&#13;
is due to public transportation. Adoption of representative West European standards, for bus&#13;
engines which is required by the Hungarians, will reduce carbon monoxide emissions by about&#13;
20 percent, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent, and particulate emissions&#13;
by 75 percent. The bus components of the combined EBRD and Bank project, together with an&#13;
ongoing program of engine conversions, are expected to reduce harmful emissions in Budapest&#13;
by about 2 percent. The Bank's Environment Strategy Study also recommends that a "special&#13;
effort should be taken to maintain and enhance the viability of mass public transit," since the&#13;
reduction of car use in the city center will decrease congestion and improve air quality. During&#13;
traffic jams, SO2 and NO, measurements were found to exceed safe limits 60 percent of the&#13;
time. Tram track renewal and the AVM system will improve the quality of public transport&#13;
service, and help to slow the expected increase in automobile traffic, as will the new parking&#13;
policy. Track renewal is expected to reduce tram noise by about 50 percent and help reduce&#13;
building damage caused by tram vibration.&#13;
E. Distributional Impact&#13;
5.8   Fare increases planned under the project will affect the welfare of the poor. The Bank&#13;
is preparing a Poverty Assessment for Hungary, expected to be completed in June, 1995. Based&#13;
on preliminary data, the rate of poverty appears to have risen in Hungary due to the economic&#13;
transformation. As measured by the proportion of people living below the official subsistence&#13;
minima, poverty has increased from 7.3 percent in 1987 to 14.9 percent in 1992, and is expected&#13;
to have risen further since then. Other indicators show a lower rate of poverty in 1992 due&#13;
primarily to the bunching of incomes near the selected cutoff, e.g. 7.2 percent based on&#13;
households receiving less than half of average income, or 2.7 percent based on households&#13;
receiving less than the minimum wage. The rate of poverty in Budapest was 9.0 percent in 1992&#13;
based on the subsistence minimum.&#13;
5.9   Hungary has an extensive system of social transfers. These transfers cost 23.1 percent&#13;
of GDP in 1994 which appears unsustainable. Social transfers include pensions, unemployment&#13;
and maternity benefits, social assistance benefits, and family allowances. An estimated HUF 5.7&#13;
billion, or 0.7 percent of social transfers, went to BKV in 1994 in the form of subsidies for free&#13;
or discounted travel for targeted passenger groups discussed below, accounting for 22 percent&#13;
of BKV income (para. 4.08). Eligibility for most social transfers, including BKV subsidies, does&#13;
not depend on income level.  As a whole, social transfers are quite evenly distributed across&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
all income levels, and the idea of targeting social transfers for the poor is not yet widely&#13;
accepted in Hungary.&#13;
5.10  Following the 33 percent fare increase in March 1995, BKV's seasonal single-mode&#13;
passes cost HUF 1,000 (US$9.17) per month, or HUF 1,500 (US$13.76) for an all modes pass.&#13;
These amount to 8 and 12 percent respectively of the minimum wage of HUF 12,200 per month.&#13;
These will increase to 12 and 19 percent of the minimum wage by 2000 following the 52 percent&#13;
real increase in fares planned under the project, other things remaining equal. The Bank is also&#13;
carrying out a poverty assessment of the relatively poor 13th District of Budapest (Angyalfold).&#13;
This provides a more accurate measure of the impact of fare increases on the poor because it&#13;
is based on household expenditures rather than wages, i.e. it takes into account unemployment,&#13;
the grey economy and social transfers. Only 42 percent of poor households (subsistence criteria)&#13;
in Angyalfold had an active earner in 1992, and 56 percent of their income came from social&#13;
transfers. The assessment found that 8.2 percent of the expenditures of poor households went&#13;
for transport to work in 1992. This would increase to 11.6 percent of household income in 2000&#13;
as a result of actual and proposed fare increases under the project, other things remaining equal.&#13;
The Poverty Assessment also found that the poor in Budapest (subsistence minimum) devoted&#13;
7.2 percent of their household expenditures to transport and communications in 1993. Planned&#13;
fare increases under the project, therefore, are likely to push the cost of public transport to the&#13;
upper limit of what the poor can afford.&#13;
5.11  Based on preliminary data from the Poverty Assessment, the permanently poor are most&#13;
likely to be those where the adults have less than a primary school education, the long-term&#13;
unemployed who no longer draw insurance based unemployment benefits and who get, at best,&#13;
casual employment, families with three or more children, and the elderly who live alone. BKV&#13;
presently provides free travel to the blind and handicapped, passengers over 70, and military&#13;
personnel and the police. BKV also provides 68-75 percent discounts to pensioners and students.&#13;
However, fare subsidies are not well targeted for the poor, as is true for most social transfers&#13;
in Hungary. Students and pensioners are distributed across all income classes.  Few if any&#13;
military personnel or policemen are poor. The Angyalfold study found that few of the working&#13;
poor (mostly casual laborers) used BKV's cheapest seasonal tickets because they could not&#13;
predict their use, and possibly because a high monthly cash outlay was required. Similarly, they&#13;
could not benefit from company based transport contributions which were reserved for regular&#13;
staff. The study also found that 9 percent of the poor and near-poor practiced free riding,&#13;
whereas none of the more affluent respondents did. Women also rely more heavily on public&#13;
transport than men (83 compared to 62 percent), and are thus more vulnerable to tariff increases.&#13;
The Municipality and BKV recognize that fare increases impose an additional burden on the&#13;
poor, and are reviewing a recently completed study of the structure of BKV fares carried out&#13;
under the EBRD project, which takes the needs of the poor into account. The Bank will discuss&#13;
the study and its follow up with the Municipality and BKV. One possibility would be for a&#13;
central Government agency to buy BKV tickets and resell them at a discount based on poverty&#13;
criteria. However, cost recovery has been or will be increased in other sectors as well, e.g.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
energy and housing, and unemployment continues to be high (11 percent in Budapest in 1994)&#13;
as uneconomic enterprises and inefficient organizations are restructured. It is the combined&#13;
impact of these factors which affects the welfare of the poor, so that a comprehensive approach&#13;
to designing a social safety net is required. The ongoing Poverty Assessment is one element in&#13;
the Bank's continuing dialogue on this subject.&#13;
5.12  Under the present system of central and municipal government subsidies to BKV, the&#13;
rural population subsidizes Budapest, and Budapest subsidizes suburban areas which receive&#13;
service but do not contribute to the municipal subsidy.  These transfers, which distort&#13;
expenditures and are economically inefficient, would be reduced under the project.&#13;
F. Conclusion and Risks&#13;
5.13  The weighted average ERR for the project is estimated to be 21 percent based on an&#13;
evaluation of components which represent 91 percent of project cost. The parameters with the&#13;
greatest uncertainty in the calculation are the cost estimates and the traffic forecast, particularly&#13;
the price elasticity of transport fares. The evaluated components are each estimated to remain&#13;
economically justified if costs are 20 percent greater than estimated, or traffic declines 6.0&#13;
percent per annum during 1993-2000 instead of 4.0 percent per annum as forecast, as detailed&#13;
in Annex 10.&#13;
5.14  The greatest risk is that BKV would fail to meet its cost-recovery or operating-ratio&#13;
targets, a major institutional objective. This would also affect the ERR, in that past projects&#13;
demonstrate that maintenance deteriorates when public transport organizations have insufficient&#13;
funds (para. 1.25). This could result from the failure of the Municipality to approve timely and&#13;
sufficient tariff increases, or to provide an adequate level of subsidy. This is a common problem&#13;
in Central and Eastern Europe, where high levels of inflation, recession, and unemployment&#13;
sometimes make it difficult to increase tariffs or implement other market reforms. However,&#13;
the Municipality and BKV have already taken steps to increase BKV's cost recovery from 19&#13;
percent in 1986 to 34 percent in 1994. They have provided assurances at all levels that they will&#13;
take the necessary steps to meet the 50 percent cost recovery target by 2000. In addition, BKV&#13;
is satisfactorily implementing their component of the Second Transport project and an EBRD&#13;
urban transport project. Financial risks are considered to be acceptable under the unusual&#13;
circumstance of a major economic transformation.&#13;
5.15  A second project risk is that the Municipality or BKV might proceed with a major&#13;
uneconomic investment, wasting scarce resources and overburdening Municipal and Central&#13;
government finances. In order to reduce this risk, the Municipality and BKV agreed at&#13;
negotiations to consult with the Bank on their transport investment plans annually, and only to&#13;
undertake transport investments greater than US$5.0 million which have an ERR greater than&#13;
10 percent calculated in accordance with a method which is acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
5.16 Other risks include BKV's lack of experience in procuring buses under ICB, and in&#13;
implementing a track renewal program that is significantly larger than previously attempted.&#13;
However, BKV, assisted by advisors, has implemented its component of the Second Transport&#13;
Sector Project satisfactorily. The project includes technical assistance to help with procurement&#13;
and contract administration, and the track renewal program will be carried out by contract(s)&#13;
which are packaged so as to assure good competition from both local and foreign finns.&#13;

6. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
A. Agreements Reached at Negotiations&#13;
6.1   During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal matters:&#13;
(i)   The Municipality will not incur any debt if the estimated debt service for any&#13;
succeeding fiscal year would be more than 15 percent of its cash income for the&#13;
twelve-month period preceding the incurrence of the debt (para. 1.15);&#13;
(ii)   BKV will implement an action plan, acceptable to the Bank, which includes&#13;
measures to reduce fare evasion to 7 percent of gross receipts from fares during&#13;
1997 and thereafter (para 4.9), improve its operational and financial productivity&#13;
(para 2.18), and separate noncore activities (para 2.20);&#13;
(iii)  By December 31, 1996, the Municipality will either award at least two transport&#13;
routes operated by BKV to privately owned operators or have regular passenger&#13;
services operated by BKV subcontracted through competitive tender so as to&#13;
reduce BKV's bus fleet requirement by at least 5 percent (para 2.22);&#13;
(iv)   BKV will achieve cost-recovery rates not lower than 37 percent in 1995, 41&#13;
percent in 1996, 43 percent in 1997, 45 percent in 1998, 47 percent in 1999 and&#13;
50 percent in 2000 and thereafter (paras. 2.23, 4.14);&#13;
(v)   The Municipality will initiate tariff increases at its General Assembly that are&#13;
necessary to enable BKV to achieve its cost-recovery objectives, and provide&#13;
sufficient funds to enable BKV to achieve an operating ratio of 100 percent in&#13;
1995 and thereafter (paras. 4.14);&#13;
(vi)   BKV's debt service coverage ratio will be no less than 1.5 (para 4.15);&#13;
(vii)  The Municipality and BKV will consult with the Bank on their transport&#13;
investment plans annually, and will only undertake transport investments greater&#13;
than US$5.0 million which have an ERR greater than 10 percent calculated in&#13;
accordance with a method acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.14);&#13;
(viii) Training Program (para. 3.12);&#13;
(ix)   Project cost and financing plan (para. 2.24, 2.25);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(x)   Arrangements and schedule for project implementation (para. 3.4);&#13;
(xi) Disbursement schedule and arrangements (paras. 3.14, 3.15, 3.17 );&#13;
(xii)  Establishment of a Special Account (para 3.16); and&#13;
(xiii) Reporting and auditing arrangements (para 3.18).&#13;
6.2   During negotiations, the borrower presented the following documents they have adopted&#13;
which are acceptable to the Bank:&#13;
(i)   The Urban Transport Policy Statement (para. 1.21); and&#13;
(ii)   The Project Implementation Plan (para. 1.23). It includes a Municipal Action&#13;
Plan, which defines the steps for improving parking management, and establishing&#13;
a Budapest Transport Association (para. 2.16), and preparing an annual&#13;
performance plan for implementating the performance agreement between the&#13;
Municipality and BKV (para. 2.19, 3.2);&#13;
6.3   The signature of an agreement between the Municipality and BKV, which requires the&#13;
Municipality to make available part of the proceeds of the loan to BKV and for BKV to provide&#13;
sufficient funds to the Municipality to service the loan, will be a condition of effectiveness (para.&#13;
2.26).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
6.4   Based on the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$38 million&#13;
equivalent to the Municipality of Budapest, with a guarantee of the Republic of Hungary, for&#13;
a term of fifteen years including five years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;

HUNGARY&#13;
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
BUDAPEST MUNICIPAL FINANCE&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
1.1   In 1990, three pieces of legislation' initiated a series of major reforms delegating&#13;
numerous spending and revenue powers to the local governments (which replaced the "local&#13;
council" system), specifying the process for the election of local officials, and transferring&#13;
ownership of the nation's publicly owned housing, and transportation and other utility assets to&#13;
the local councils and their constituent local governments.&#13;
1.2   The Law  on Local-Self Government (LSGA) reorganized Hungary's system  of&#13;
governance. Government now comprises the central government (the State), 19 county&#13;
governments plus the capital city of Budapest, and 3,148 independent local units organized as&#13;
villages or towns: and in the case of Budapest, 22 independent (sub-municipal) districts.2 Of the&#13;
3,148 local governments, 42 (which include the Budapest districts) have a population of 50,000&#13;
or more, and account for approximately 40 percent of the Hungarian population.&#13;
1.3   The role of the 19 counties is in flux. They no longer supervise village and town&#13;
councils, nor do they serve as the financing conduit between the central and local government.&#13;
Instead, they have a residual coordinating role for providing certain services such as hospitals&#13;
and secondary schools in areas of the country where the villages and towns lack the capacity to&#13;
deliver those services independently.&#13;
1.4   The LSGA dictates mandatory as well as optional areas of local government activity. The&#13;
mandatory tasks are water management, primary education, basic health and social services,&#13;
maintenance of public cemeteries, and ensuring the rights of ethnic minorities. Expenditures that&#13;
are not mandatory, but cited as part of the "competency of local governments," include local&#13;
development and resettlement programs, sewerage, maintenance of local public roads and local&#13;
mass transportation, garbage collection, and fire protection.&#13;
1.5   The central government remains responsible for activities such as the collection of most&#13;
taxes, national debt service, police, and large scale investment. In addition, it is largely (though&#13;
not wholly) financially responsible for unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and health&#13;
services. These activities are financed through the transfer of a social security contribution to&#13;
localities, which act as the central government's agents. The local governments are, however,&#13;
1/    The Law on Local Self-Government (Act No. LXV of 1990), the Law On Local Taxes (Act C of 1990 as&#13;
Amended, 1992), and the Law on Elections of Self-Govemments (Act No. LXVI, 1990).&#13;
2/    As of January 1995 there are 23 district govemments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

responsible for complementing these social programs--that is, they must meet incremental&#13;
expenditures when the central financing proves inadequate.&#13;
Budapest Governmental Structure&#13;
1.6    The LSGA contains a specific chapter on the governmental structure of the Capital,&#13;
which, as amended:&#13;
*      recognizes the "special role and position' of the Capital;&#13;
*     provides for a General Assembly of 88 members;&#13;
*      mandates that within the geographical boundaries of the Capital, there shall be 22 (23 as&#13;
of January 1995) separate district self-governments. Each district is represented by one&#13;
seat in the Budapest General Assembly (the other 66 are directly elected)3;&#13;
*     generally directs that the districts execute tasks related to neighborhood services, while&#13;
the Municipality shall execute tasks and functions that affect the "whole or a large part&#13;
of the Capital." Specifically, the districts are to perform duties related to the maintenance&#13;
of local roads in their districts, whereas the maintenance and development of main roads&#13;
and routes used by public transport are the responsibility of the Municipality of Budapest.&#13;
In addition, the Municipality is assigned the maintenance of national roadways within city&#13;
boundaries, responsibility for traffic control, and public transport (trams, buses,&#13;
underground services, and suburban train lines).&#13;
1.7    The fiscal condition of the municipal budget is closely tied to its relationship with the&#13;
districts. This is true for three reasons. First, the municipal-district split of all municipal&#13;
revenues must be negotiated each year. Second, the present arrangements give to the districts&#13;
access to several taxes which the municipality does not employ.4 And, third, the division of&#13;
expenditure responsibilities between the municipality and the districts must be continuously&#13;
revisited, (including the merits of selfgovernment and the mechanisms for intra/local cooperation&#13;
in service delivery).&#13;
/      7'The General Assembly has yet to determine the changes in the assembly voting structure that will accompany the&#13;
creation of District 23.&#13;
4/     Taxes levied by the General Assembly of the Capital may not be introduced by the districts until the repeal of such&#13;
taxes.&#13;

2.    The Budapest Fiscal System&#13;
Local Revenues&#13;
Own Source Taxes&#13;
2.1   The Law On Local Taxes grants local self govemments authority to levy five types of&#13;
own-source taxes (taxes for which the government can set its own rates). Of these five, the&#13;
Budapest Municipality levies only the general business (turnover) tax. At present, three taxes&#13;
are district levies, and the fifth (a poll tax) is not used by any government. To summarize:&#13;
*     Local Industrial (General Business) Tax. A gross turnover tax is levied on enterprises&#13;
(public and private) based on the gross sales of revenue net of VAT and other&#13;
consumption taxes, cost of goods sold, and the value of subcontractor services. Tax base&#13;
information is provided by the central government Tax Administration Office.&#13;
*     Tourism Tax. A transient accommodations tax of four percent (4%) of the bill may be&#13;
levied and collected by all localities. Exemptions are provided for children, the elderly,&#13;
health and social care institutions, students, and relatives of the owner of a holiday&#13;
house.&#13;
*     Property Tax(es). There are two property tax bases: (i) a tax on unimproved land and (ii)&#13;
a tax on improvements. The tax on land is levied on unimproved private and public land&#13;
(unless otherwise exempt) at a maximum rate of HUF100 per m2 or one percent (1%)&#13;
of "corrected value," which is defined as 50% of observed market value. The tax on&#13;
improvements is levied on private buildings--e.g., flats, second homes, workshops,&#13;
garages. As with the land tax, the rate is based on area (Ft. 300/m2) or a corrected value&#13;
of 50% of market. For both the land and building tax, the subject of taxation is the&#13;
owner(s) of the property on the first day of the year. In case the building is encumbered,&#13;
the tax is on the user--i.e., the person(s) entitled to exercise the pecuniary rights.&#13;
Centrally Shared Taxes and Fees&#13;
2.2   There are two shared taxes and a shared fee, each fully controlled and administered by&#13;
the central government.&#13;
*     Personal Income Tax. Thirty percent (30%) of state personal income tax collections are&#13;
returned to local governments by place of origin. The remaining 70% is retained by the&#13;
state. There is a two-year lag between the central collection and eventual distribution of&#13;
the tax, which causes a significant inflation erosion.&#13;
*     Motor Vehicle (Engine) Tax. Since 1992 Budapest Municipality has been entitled to&#13;
50% of taxes imposed on vehicles brought into the city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
*     Environmental Penalties. Local governments receive 3%  of environmental penalties&#13;
imposed by the state.&#13;
Sales of Assets&#13;
2.3   Budapest may generate revenues from privatization of publicly-owned housing, land, and&#13;
own-commercial enterprises, and from the profits and rents from own-entrepreneurial activities.&#13;
To summarize the key aspects:&#13;
*     Rent levels for publicly-owned flats are set by the central government and managed by&#13;
a district-owned property management company (IKV).&#13;
*     Sale of housing. Proceeds from the sale of housing accrue to the districts. The Parliament&#13;
recently enacted a law requiring 50% of housing privatization proceeds be shared with&#13;
Budapest Municipality; however, the law is currently under legal challenge.&#13;
*     Rent and sale (privatization! of commercial enterprises. Localities and their agencies may&#13;
receive some proceeds from privatization of commercial properties. Briefly, the rules of&#13;
the system are as follows: rents accrue to a municipal enterprise (which is off-budget);&#13;
sales of small enterprises accrue to the municipality; and sales of large enterprises are&#13;
managed by the National State Property Agency (SPA), which shares the proceeds with&#13;
the local government.&#13;
*     Profits from entrepreneurial activities (e.g.. joint ventures). Local governments may&#13;
generate on-budget revenues from commercial enterprises such as utilities that are not&#13;
controlled by an IKV. Examples include tourism facilities and other recreational facilities&#13;
(e.g. golf courses), construction firms.&#13;
Central Transfers&#13;
There are four categories of state fiscal transfers that appear in the Budapest budget.&#13;
The Normative (Unconditional) Grant&#13;
2.4   The single most important source of Budapest revenues, the normative grant, is an&#13;
unconditional transfer. There are two elements to the grant: (i) a lump-sum transfer for HUF2&#13;
million/yr, which is designed to provide a minimum amount to all jurisdictions; and (ii) a&#13;
formula grant based on "norms" or need indices. The norms are of three general types: a&#13;
standard service related per capita (head quota); a small matching grant (e.g., each HUF of&#13;
resort charges under the tourist tax is supplemented by 2 HUF); and 18 expenditure related&#13;
weights designed to estimate the service "demands" relating to the main LSGA-assigned&#13;
responsibilities of the municipality. The norms are not indexed and are subject to annual&#13;
negotiation. The average [norm/actual cost] ratio is about 66%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
Targeted (Matching) Grants&#13;
2.5   Targeted grants are allocated to local governments on a competitive basis and are&#13;
accompanied by a central-local matching requirement. The grant must meet central government&#13;
objectives. The central-local match varies by function.&#13;
Addressed Grants&#13;
2.6   Specific (addressed) grants are intended to finance projects undertaken by central&#13;
government under the prior regime. The grants are fully earmarked by the state for a specific&#13;
use; thus they provide little fiscal flexibility to the municipal government. In fact the addressed&#13;
grants are likely to generate long-term municipal costs of facility maintenance and the&#13;
development of locally-financed related on-site infrastructure.&#13;
Other Centrally Earmarked Transfers&#13;
2.7   There are two other state transfers to the Budapest budget: (i) a social security&#13;
contribution that is structured as a pass-through of funds spent on the operations of health&#13;
institutions; and (ii) special ad hoc earmarked grants.&#13;
3. Municipal Finance&#13;
3.1   Details on the annual revenue and expenditure of the Budapest Municipality for the four&#13;
years 1991 through 1994 are attached (Tables 1 and 2).  During the three years ending&#13;
December 1994 the Municipality revenue increased by 32% from HUF57.0 billion to HUF75.3&#13;
billion (US$731 million). During the same period the total flow of funds (revenue plus loans)&#13;
increased 55 % to HUF89.4 billion. In 1991 centrally allocated funds accounted for 71 % of the&#13;
Municipality's funds, Municipality's own revenue provided 19%, other revenue 9% and loan&#13;
1%. In 1994 centrally-allocated revenue fell to about 50%, the Municipality's own revenue&#13;
increased to 29%, other revenue decreased to 5%, but loans increased to 16%.&#13;
3.2   The Municipality's current expenditure during the three years ending December 1994&#13;
increased 36% from HUF47.9 billion to HUF65.0 billion, while capital expenditure increased&#13;
250% from HUF7.0 billion in 1991 to HUF 24.4 billion in 1994. This gave an overall&#13;
expenditure increase of 63 % to HUF89.4 billion for the three years. Subsidies to BKV represent&#13;
about 17% of the Municipality's total funds in 1991. This was reduced to about 12% in 1994.&#13;
As a result of the increased cost recovery ratios agreed with BKV under this project, the&#13;
percentage expenditure on subsidies will be significantly reduced over the next six years.&#13;
3.3   During three of the four years (1991, 1992, and 1993) there was a cumulative surplus&#13;
on current account totalling HUF23.5 billion but in 1994 there was a deficit of HUF4.2 billion.&#13;
On the combined current and capital accounts there was a surplus of HUF7.2 billion for the first&#13;
three years and a break-even in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
3.4   The Municipality's borrowing as of December 1993 was about HUF7.0 billion. During&#13;
1994 the Municipality signed a loan agreement with EBRD for a loan of US$47 million which&#13;
was transferred to BKV in the form of an equity contribution. In addition to the Bank loan of&#13;
US$38.0 million, the Municipality proposes to borrow in 1995 a loan of HUF8.5 billion (US$65&#13;
million) for "Investment of State Importance." The debt service on the HIJF8.5 billion loan will&#13;
be financed directly by the Government and BKV will finance the debt service on the World&#13;
Bank loan. To ensure a prudent policy on municipal borrowing, agreement was reached during&#13;
negotiations that the Municipality will not incur further debts, if the debt service of the&#13;
Municipality would exceed 15% of its income. Loans on which the debt service would be&#13;
financed by other agencies would not be included in this calculation unless the debt service was&#13;
in arrears.&#13;

HUNGARY&#13;
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
Municipal Urban Transport Policy&#13;
The following statement is the final draft of the Urban Transport Policy Statement agreed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
I. Ilrduction&#13;
1.1        Urban transport policy for Budapest consists of those general principles adopted&#13;
by the Budapest City Government (BCG), to guide the process of operating, regulating and&#13;
further developing this important public utility. More specific policy instruments and procedures&#13;
have been derived starting from these general principles. While the general policy orientation&#13;
is expected to be stable, policy instruments and priorities are by nature time-variant, and will&#13;
evolve together with social, political, economic and technological changes in the city and the&#13;
country.&#13;
1.2        This summary of urban trnsport policy for Budapest is compiled for use within&#13;
the context of preparing and negotiating the Budapest Urban Transport Development Project,&#13;
financed in part by the World Bank. It is based on continuing work in this area commissioned&#13;
in 1992 by the BCG. Further detail can be found in the publications TbhePgammeDofMa=z&#13;
Demszky for the City of Budadest1 Preliminary Studies (1991); Budapest Transport System&#13;
Dfvlcment, draft document of March 1993; and numerous supporting documents.&#13;
II. Cily Bacl=r=und&#13;
2.1         The city of Budapest, the capital of Hungary, has a stable population of 2.01&#13;
million and about 1,200,000 jobs. The highest level decision-maldng body of the city&#13;
government is the General Assembly, represented by the Mayor, directly elected by the&#13;
residents. There are 23 district governments on the territory of Budapest having essentially the&#13;
same degree of sovereign ruling. Urban transport is under the jurisdiction of the BCG.&#13;
2.2         The BCG budget is financed through contributions from the State budget and local&#13;
fees and taxes, currently at a 80/20 ratio. The economy of the capital is undergoing structural&#13;
change, in terms of the type, size, location and ownership of industrial and commercial&#13;
activities. The trend is away from heavy industry, away from large-scale enterprises, towards&#13;
service industries and a growing private sector. Another shift being implemented is a gradual&#13;
decrease in public spending by the State and greater spending by local governments and&#13;
individuals. Among the current consequences of economic transformation are increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
unemployment in some sectors and pressure on both public and individual budgets, but also&#13;
increased wealth in those segments of the local economy which are experiencing fast growth.&#13;
2.3         Urban structure consists of the inner city, which contains the majority of&#13;
administrative and commercial activities, mixed in with traditional multi-story housing; and&#13;
single-purpose housing and industrial estates at the urban fringe. The transport system is multi-&#13;
modal and extensive. Intra-urban mass transport services are provided by Budapest Transport&#13;
Company (BKV), now a budgetary unit of the City Government. BKV has a service network&#13;
of 830 km including buses, tramways, trolley-buses, the metro and commuter railways.&#13;
Important regional, national and international transport services to and from Budapest are&#13;
provided by Hungarian Railways (MAV), and Volanbusz, the inter-city bus company. The&#13;
urban travel market, some 5 million trips per day, is characterized by the dominance of mass&#13;
transport modes. This was very pronounced throughout the 1980s, when trips using mass&#13;
transport services and those by passenger cars had a 80/20 ratio. This is now changing as result&#13;
of economic restructuring in industry and commerce, greater auto ownership, and downward&#13;
pressure on public spending for mass transport. Though still in favor of mass transport, the&#13;
modal split has slipped to a 70/30 ratio. Auto ownership has reached the level of 260 vehicles&#13;
per 1,000 population, twice that of 10 years ago, and is still growing, as is the use of autos.&#13;
The consequences include sharp environmental degradation and increased traffic delays,&#13;
particularly on the Danube crossings. Increased traffic use and congestion affect negatively the&#13;
service and costs of public transport modes which operate in mixed-traffic thoroughfares, and&#13;
generate strong pressures for greater spending for road maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
expansion. Vehicles parked on sidewalks have reduced the space available for pedestrians to&#13;
intolerably low levels.&#13;
III. Policy Objectives. Major Issues and Principles&#13;
3.1         The overall policy objective, guiding the decisions of the City Government which&#13;
concern current system operations, as well as those affecting changes to scale and structure of&#13;
the system, is to find the balance between economic growth and social development, to preserve&#13;
historical and cultural heritage, and protect/enhance the natural environment.&#13;
3.2         Added to the above objective is a traditional concern of the authorities, both&#13;
elected and appointed ones, to tailor expenditure programs to fit available resources, and use&#13;
public funds only when expected benefits exceed costs, where the beneficial results would be the&#13;
greatest. In addition, attempting to achieve an equitable distribution of benefits and costs&#13;
throughout the urban populace is a further requirement.&#13;
3.3         The most urgent shorter-term issue which the City Government is now facing in&#13;
the area of urban transport concerns the relative roles of mass transport services and individual&#13;
motorized and non-motorized transport modes. Another major issue, this one of longer-term&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
AnnC&amp; 2&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
nature, concerns the degree of road development needed by the City, linked to a general question&#13;
of major road and mass transport investments, their selection and funding.  The City&#13;
Government has adopted the policy that, as a matter of immediate and permanent concern, the&#13;
slippage of modal split towards greater use of the private car should be slowed down and, within&#13;
certain city zones and corridors, arrested. On the other hand, the BCG recognizes the link&#13;
between economic growth and private vehicle use, and will consider new road projects within&#13;
a carefully defined identification and selection process.&#13;
IV. Elaboration of Policy Principles&#13;
4.1          The following sections summarize, in the most important areas of concem, how&#13;
the BCG intends to translate the above major policy principles into more concrete policies, plans&#13;
and programs.&#13;
Mass transport fares and subsidy policy&#13;
4.2         Until very recently, mass transport fares in Budapest were quite low, covering&#13;
under 25 % of total costs of BKV; the rest was paid for from the State/City budget, which also&#13;
made major contributions towards BKV's capital investments. Low fares and an extensive&#13;
service network explain why the usage of the mass transport system in Budapest has been one&#13;
of the highest in the world. Over the past five years, the constraints on the City and state&#13;
budgets reduced the amounts available for mass transport subsidies. It was recognized that&#13;
passengers would have to bear greater proportion of BKV costs and that these costs will have&#13;
to be reduced. Fare increases and other changes already introduced have increased cost recovery&#13;
of the BKV to about 35%. At the same time, BKV has been losing passengers, in part because&#13;
of higher fares, but also due to the growth in ownership and use of automobiles. It is also&#13;
evident that BKV's overall financial position has deteriorated and the company have been&#13;
deferring maintenance and rehabilitation of their system.&#13;
4.3          The BCG acknowledge the need for a comprehensive approach to mass transport&#13;
provision, pricing and financing, linked to complementary policies in other dimensions of the&#13;
urban transport system. Taking into account the increasing demand for scarce public funds and&#13;
the need to generate funds for plant renewal, the BCG will implement an action program to&#13;
reduce operating BKV costs and gradually increase fares to achieve a 50% cost recovery rate&#13;
by 1999. At the same time, the BCG are taldng actions to reduce automobile use in the central&#13;
business district (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
4.4         The main features of the action program directed at mass transport services will&#13;
include:&#13;
(1)   regular fare revisions aimed at reducing the gap between BKV's revenues and&#13;
expenditures, mindful of the need not to make mass transport unaffordable to&#13;
lower-income citizens;&#13;
(2)   revision of the fare system and modernization of fare sales and collection&#13;
technology, the principle of which the General Assembly has already adopted&#13;
based on recent studies;&#13;
(3)   integration of BKV fares with MAV and Budapest VOLAN fares into a unified&#13;
system, meant to increase revenues with current demand and attract more&#13;
passengers mainly by diverting them from passenger car to the public transport.&#13;
The basis for this, the creation of a Budapest Transport Association, has been&#13;
agreed with the major partners and the Ministry of Transport, Communications&#13;
and Water Management;&#13;
(4)   adoption of measures to combat fare fraud, combining improved control of access&#13;
to stations, compliance and penalty collection as well as improvement of ticket&#13;
sales and application of advanced technology;&#13;
(5)   agreement that a policy of full cost recovery should be adopted for special, on-&#13;
demand BKV services and aggressive marketing should be used to increase such&#13;
services;&#13;
(6)   review of BKV's network and services schedules, with a view of eliminating&#13;
unreasonable duplication of routes, over-supply or other inefficiencies. In order&#13;
to review the current service standards from the aspect of resource availability,&#13;
an internal task force will be created;&#13;
(7)   actions to reduce costs and improve output of BKV  operations through&#13;
organizational, procedural, divestiture and investment means (see below); and&#13;
(8)   reduction of BKV operating costs through measures to increase priority treatment&#13;
of street-based BKV vehicles; these will include additional reserved lanes and&#13;
priority of passage at intersections, this last to be achieved through modernization&#13;
of the traffic signal system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Traffic restraint in the inner city&#13;
4.5         It is a universal experience in the industrialized European societies that neither&#13;
a high-quality supply of urban mass transport nor less-than-economic fares suffice to achieve a&#13;
socially desirable split between mass transport and private motor vehicles. The BCG are&#13;
therefore committed to an activist traffic restraint approach for the inner city and an&#13;
environmentally oriented traffic-calming approach for non-central zones. In this respect,&#13;
implementation of a new parking regulation scheme is of prime importance (see next section).&#13;
Other instruments for traffic restraint in the inner city will include: inter-connection and&#13;
optimization of traffic signals to limit entry to motor vehicles using the gateway concept; new&#13;
traffic circulation plan featuring extensive use of one-way streets; increase in lanes reserved for&#13;
mass transit vehicles; new pedestrian-only streets and zones; and improved traffic law&#13;
enforcement. For tactical reasons, traffic restraint will be applied in tandem with road and mass&#13;
transport improvements, allowing timely availability of alternatives to car use. Accordingly, a&#13;
new one-way circulation system and traffic signal improvements will be timed to follow the&#13;
completion of works on Hungaria Ring and other street improvement projects.&#13;
Parking capacity and management in the inner city&#13;
4.6         Parking in the inner city has not been regulated in a systematic manner; its&#13;
financial aspects have been neglected and enforcement is weak. The BCG believe the solution&#13;
is the implementation of a comprehensive parking regulation and have commenced&#13;
implementation with a wide range of measures. Its objectives would be to act as restraint on&#13;
non-essential demand, increase traffic capacity of inner city streets, and minimize encroachment&#13;
of pedestian spaces. As a first stage of this policy, a new on-street parking regulation scheme&#13;
is being introduced based on the establishment and gradual extension of the Budapest Parking&#13;
Association, an organization involving BCG and the concerned district govemments. The&#13;
program would systematize the use of available space through the use of residential parking&#13;
permits, and a system of time limits and charges for non-residents; and propose organization&#13;
for parking management in particular those organizational arrangements ensuring compliance,&#13;
enforcement and towing away illegally parked vehicles. The program would systematize the use&#13;
of available space through the use of residential parking permits, and a system of time limits and&#13;
charges for non-residents. It will also involve a new organization for parking management,&#13;
focussing on those organizational arrangements which would ensure compliance, enforcement&#13;
and towing away illegally parked vehicles.&#13;
Using vehicle charges for traffic restraint&#13;
4.7         A proposal was also raised to introduce entry/use charges for motor vehicles in&#13;
the inner city, with a double objective of restraint and generation of funds. It is felt, however,&#13;
that too many changes adopted at the same time may be counter-productive; it was therefore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
decided that the new parking management program should be implemented first and its&#13;
experience evaluated, before proceeding with more drastic methods. Notwithstanding this, the&#13;
BCG have instructed the City Administration to carry out a study of feasibility of introducing&#13;
certain methods of road pricing. However, in addition to the substantial capital investment&#13;
needed for any such measure, a sensitive political decision of different relevant public bodies&#13;
would be necessary for a proposal still deemed premature,&#13;
Walking and nonrmotorized modes&#13;
4.8          The strategy adopted by the BCG is to create a network of environmentally-&#13;
friendly zones across the entire urban area: people-only streets and zones, restricted-traffic&#13;
zones, bicycle paths, etc. The approach is to develop, in cooperation with district governments,&#13;
a set of differentiated design principles for specific parts of the urban territory.&#13;
4.9         Specifically for the inner city, the BCG are committed to extending the people-&#13;
only zones, following the highly successful experience of the Vaci Street complex, and will&#13;
attempt to inter-connect these whenever possible. Moreover, traffic restraint and parking&#13;
management programs will be designed taling full account of pedestrian interests. As a matter&#13;
of high priority, it is intended to gradually return sidewalks and squares back to pedestrian use&#13;
along with preservation of green areas. The BCG will work with the local and national&#13;
authorities responsible for better enforcement of regulations protecting pedestrians in traffic.&#13;
4.10        The BCG acknowledge the growing popularity and importance of bicycle traffic,&#13;
both as a recreational activity and for transport purposes. About 22 km of bicycle paths already&#13;
exist and another 44 km are under construction. It is known, however, that more effort is&#13;
necessary if the bicycle is to realize its full potential as a transport mode. The BCG are&#13;
committed to creating an inter-connected system of bicycle paths all over the city, and will&#13;
intensively cooperate with district governments and maintain close contacts with NGOs interested&#13;
in this matter.&#13;
4.11        In order to extend the radius of bicycle use, the BCG will devise and implement&#13;
a program to add bicycle racks at various parts of the city, including the vicinity of parking lots,&#13;
mass transport stations and other activity centers.  Furthermore, opportunities to allow&#13;
passengers on mass transport modes to bring their bicycles along will be extended.&#13;
Role of the private sector and BKV status&#13;
4.12        The BCG have taken a considered view of the debate and recent international&#13;
experience on the potential involvement of the private sector in urban transport.  It is&#13;
acknowledged that private sector can be an important source of investment capital, a vehicle for&#13;
rapid transfer of technology and the know-how, and the creator of new employment. Also, the&#13;
introduction of competition in any given economic sector, where bidders would include private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
entrants, has potential to reduce costs and improve the supply of goods and services. The&#13;
question is where and how to call on the private sector to improve urban transport in Budapest.&#13;
4.13        Involvement of privately-owned organizations into the public transport requires&#13;
careful examination. The BCG are of the opinion -- in conformity with current legislation -- that&#13;
the ownership of major facilities and rolling stock should remain in public hands, as should the&#13;
authority to set service standards and determine fare and subsidy policies. This position&#13;
notwithstanding, the BCG are committed to increasing the role of the market in this context.&#13;
This will be done in the following three ways.&#13;
(1)   Transformation of the legal status of BKV, to provide a sound basis for a market&#13;
orientation in its service planning and internal operations. In accordance with the&#13;
Hungarian law on transformation of state enterprises, the process of looking in-&#13;
depth at various options for BKV future has to be completed by December 31,&#13;
1996. The BCG have already decided about the transformation of BKV into a&#13;
shareholding company. This option would place BKV under a commercial code&#13;
and managerial freedom will increase, while the interests of the city are still&#13;
represented adequately by a strong public presence in its Board of Directors.&#13;
(2)   Greater commercialization of BKV's operations, under the current status, in order&#13;
to reduce the size of BKV and increase its reliance on buying outside services on&#13;
the market. A study to define practical steps to achieve this was completed in&#13;
December 1994. The major thrust of the study was to look at each individual&#13;
non-operational activity of BKV and recommend its transformation, re-&#13;
organization or divestiture. It was proposed to separate the Construction Division&#13;
and Printing Shop of BKV from the company. Preparatory work for taking&#13;
relevant decisions is underway.&#13;
(3)   Use of concessions in transport operations to complement or replace existing BKV&#13;
services.  Since costs and benefits of this initiative are far from  being&#13;
unambiguous, the BCG will initiate in 1996 a demonstration program of private&#13;
provision of mass transport services on two urban routes.&#13;
BKV costs and service efficiency&#13;
4.14        The BCG are fully committed to increasing the service/cost ratio in mass transport&#13;
in Budapest. In addition to various actions already listed above, the management of BKV was&#13;
instructed to undertake a systematic program of internal re-organization and "staff profile&#13;
cleaning," updating of procedures, staff re-assignment, training and reduction. These processes&#13;
are all underway. We are in the process of developing global and partial targets for improved&#13;
BKV performance and will integrate these in the annual review process.  Also, BKV&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

management is instructed to analyze the service network, hours of operation and service&#13;
frequencies, with a view of removing duplication and other inefficiencies, or maldng other&#13;
propositions to increase service/cost ratio.&#13;
4.15        Finally, the BCG are e.mitted to enabling BKV to invest in modernization of&#13;
facilities; rolling stock; diverse tools and aids, hardware and software alike; and training. A&#13;
program of up-to-date vehicle identification and 2-way communication, started under a project&#13;
financed in part by the World Bank, is being followed by a larger-scale fleet renewal project&#13;
with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Another investment project,&#13;
focussing on bus replacement and tramway track renewal, is being prepared with assistance of&#13;
the World Bank. The BCG will assist BKV management in seeking grant financing to develop&#13;
and install a cost accounting system to permit better management by objectives.&#13;
Strategic urban transport planning&#13;
4.16        It is recognized that actions concerning current transport system operations and&#13;
investment decisions about individual projects need to be coherent with a long-term transport&#13;
development strategy, itself in agreement with an overall urban development strategy, and based&#13;
on realistic expectations of resource availability. The BCG have inherited a transport master&#13;
plan based on planning concepts no longer valid, including under-elaborated economic&#13;
estimations. These need to be adjusted to new and emerging socio-economic realities and trends,&#13;
and new concepts as well. The BCG have commissioned a series of studies aiming to develop&#13;
strategic urban land use documents and, in parallel, a strategic transport plan. The studies&#13;
involve considerable transport demand data collection and modelling efforts.   The&#13;
Comprehensive Budapest Traffic Survey will be available in the spring 1995. A medium-term&#13;
(up to year 2000) investment program is approaching completion and a less firm plan will be&#13;
developed for the period after year 2000. It is needed however to await the completion of the&#13;
new urban development plans, to ensure mutual coherence, before they would be presented to&#13;
the City Assembly for consideration.&#13;
Mass transport system develooment&#13;
4.17        An important objective of the ongoing strategic plaMnning is to review expensive&#13;
segregated-track mass transit proposals with due regard to their functional role, economic&#13;
performance and financial viability. The general orientation of the BCG is to limit rail-based,&#13;
reserved track modes to the most important radial and ring elements of the urban and regional&#13;
mass transport network, and use of the less expensive transport modes to the maximum degree&#13;
possible. This in no way diminishes the commitment toward protected lanes for public transport&#13;
vehicles or application of rail-based environmentally-friendly technologies of transportation.&#13;
4.18        Some of the strategic mass transport projects, notably a new metro line in the&#13;
southwestern corridor in Buda (DBR line), have been at an advanced stage of consideration for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

a long time. The course of action on such projects will be decided on case-by-case basis, while&#13;
respecting as much as practicable the new principles concerning strategic decisions and project&#13;
preparation and evaluation noted in the preceding and subsequent paragraphs of this summary.&#13;
Road network&#13;
4.19        Structural problems of the road system of Budapest, of which resolution is only&#13;
possible through investment, were recognized a long time ago. Under the current conditions,&#13;
these actions have only become more urgent and, in some cases, critical. The priority&#13;
investments, some of which are under construction, include: (1) two southern bridges over the&#13;
Danube, one of which is under construction; (2) connectors from the MO ring-road to the arterial&#13;
street network; (3) Hungaria Ring development; and (4) missing links in the strategic network&#13;
inside the outer ring road (road #6 in Buda, #5 in Pest, and Czepel Thoroughfare).&#13;
4.20        Aside from the network development projects, a major effort will be required to&#13;
maintain and rehabilitate the existing road network. The BCG have identified urgent road&#13;
rehabilitation works, and will take steps to systematize the work on assessing road conditions&#13;
and programming maintenance.&#13;
Project preparation and evaluation&#13;
4.21        One of the major areas where past concepts have not been adequate is project&#13;
preparation and evaluation process. What has been particularly lacking is the economic and&#13;
financial dimension in technical work and decision making. The BCG recognize that the&#13;
requisite changes in this context will be among the more difficult to introduce and sustain. An&#13;
internal assessment of the prevailing preparation and evaluation practices for major projects shall&#13;
be carried out, with a view of defining an improved sequence and contents of engineering and&#13;
economic studies for such projects and ensuring their integration into the decision-making&#13;
process. It is justified to adopt a multi-criteria approach to cost-benefit analysis in case of major&#13;
investment projects.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
4.22        Improved planning will not live to expectations unless the project implementation&#13;
procedures are effective. One of the key elements to this is to simplify and make more&#13;
transparent the system of decision making in preparing investment decisions and establish&#13;
generally applicable and transparent rules for the procedures of procurement and implementation&#13;
of works. To this end, the BCG are committed to revise its existing procedures in consideration&#13;
of the goals mentioned above.&#13;

Trnsprt financ&#13;
4.23        Individual project proposals may be functionally and economically attractive, but&#13;
still be excluded from the City's investment program, or delayed to a later date. Which projects&#13;
enter the program and which get rejected or delayed does not depend only on their economic&#13;
"score" but also on the financial capacity of the BCG. Likewise, it is difficult to adopt a policy&#13;
on fares and subsidies in mass transport without knowing the relevant budgetary limits. Though&#13;
various ad hoc proposals for urban transport finance have been put forward, this subject has not&#13;
been systematically studied in Budapest. As indicated above, the contributions from mass transit&#13;
users will increase but fall far short of covering costs; likewise, expectations of capital coming&#13;
from parking charges and from private investors in either transport services or transport-related&#13;
real estate developments are modest.&#13;
4.24        In this situation, the BCG are committed to developing a comprehensive approach&#13;
to urban transport finance, distinct from looking for cost reduction opportunities in the sector.&#13;
A study will be commissioned to analyze all potential sources and modes of finance, above and&#13;
beyond the current BCG budget. Charging for the use of urban roads, already noted above, will&#13;
be only one of the numerous options to be explored. The option to create a dedicated&#13;
Transportation Fund for Budapest will be specifically explored. Our preliminary estimations&#13;
indicate that a combination of user charges and fees (still excluding road user charges); BCG and&#13;
district budget contributions; local bonds and loans; disposal of city assets; parking revenues and&#13;
other sources, could generate a transport investment resources about two to three times greater&#13;
than the current annual budget.&#13;

Municipal Urban Transport Investment Plan&#13;
Transport organization&#13;
1.          The Municipality of Budapest discharges its responsibilities in the transport&#13;
sector through specialized committees, several Deputy Mayors (including one for&#13;
Infrastructure and Services) and the Technical Department, which has four divisions in this&#13;
sector: for public transport, traffic engineering, roads and bridges, and development. In the&#13;
past, the Ministry of Transport has had functional authority over BKV. Its Transportation&#13;
Department oversaw operations of all public transport enterprises, examined their annual&#13;
performance and financial reports, as well as investment and operating plans. The Technical&#13;
Development Department of the Ministry reviewed longer-term proposals, hired consulting&#13;
firms to prepare and help implement projects, and provided coordination with the city&#13;
authorities. With the new emphasis on local government, the role of the Ministry is&#13;
changing. BKV has become a Municipal enterprise of Budapest, at least in the transition&#13;
period, and the cross relations between the municipal and national levels are still evolving.&#13;
Even if the Ministry gives up the control over micro-aspects of BKV's operations, it remains&#13;
to be seen which powers it will retain concerning the intra-sectoral reconciliation of transport&#13;
investment plans and the integration of these into an economy-wide public investment and&#13;
expenditure program.&#13;
The Municipal Investment Plan&#13;
2.          The Municipality of Budapest has launched the study of a transport master&#13;
plan called the Budapest Transport System Development. It includes road and bridge&#13;
projects, traffic management operations and improvement of the public transport network.&#13;
For the years 1993 - 2000, the projects have been rated on a one to three scale according to&#13;
their priority and cost estimates have been provided. The DBR Metro Project was&#13;
considered a first priority, but the recent decision of the Municipality to cancel the bids and&#13;
to proceed with a prefeasibility study changes its priority status. The total amounts for first&#13;
priority projects are shown in table 1.&#13;
3.          The main first priority road and bridge construction projects are:&#13;
the Lagymanyos bridge over the Danube, south of the existing bridges, mainly&#13;
financed by the State budget, and its associated road development financed by&#13;
the Municipality,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 3&#13;
the Hungaria Ring Road,&#13;
some radial roads, such as road 6, road 5 or the Csepel thoroughfare, that&#13;
should act as feeders to the various ring roads,&#13;
construction of smaller roads, especially in the Buda Hills area, and&#13;
-     reconstruction of most of the Danube's bridges.&#13;
4.          The plan includes the rehabilitation of tram tracks and the replacement of&#13;
buses, financed by the Bank and the EBRD. Some service extensions, or major&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitations, for BKV are also proposed:&#13;
-     the extension of the tramway line 1 on the Hungaria Ring Road and across the&#13;
Lagymanyos Bridge,&#13;
-     the extension of the tram lines on the embankment of the Danube,&#13;
-     the rehabilitation of the Millenium Line--the nearly hundred year old metro&#13;
line--financed by the EBRD,&#13;
-     the reconstruction of the tramway line 2 from the Chain Bridge to the Ersebet&#13;
Bridge,&#13;
-     some minor extensions or connections.&#13;
5.          A new traffic control center will be establish for the South-Buda area, traffic&#13;
lights in the northern city sector will be included in the central traffic management system,&#13;
and obsolete traffic management equipment will be replaced. The investments, required by&#13;
the enforcement of the three zones with restricted access to private cars proposed by the&#13;
Municipality and by the parking management scheme, are also included in the plan.&#13;
6.          Nonmotorized modes are a priority of the Municipality: a 110 km network of&#13;
bicycle path will be developed and significant improvements of pedestrian sidewalks are&#13;
prepared.&#13;

HUNGARY&#13;
BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
The Budapest Transport Company (BKV)&#13;
1.          BKV was created in 1968, by a decision by the Budapest Municipal Council, from&#13;
the then-existing seven transport enterprises. In 1973, it assumed management of metro&#13;
operations, thus integrating all major modal components of the city's transport system. Its 1993&#13;
fleet of about 3,614 vehicles consisted of 1,685 buses, 924 trams and cog-wheels, 205 trolley-&#13;
buses, 410 metro cars, 371 suburban train cars and 19 passenger ships. The average age is 6&#13;
years for the bus fleet, 23 years for trams, 16 for suburban trains and 11 for metro cars. The&#13;
network is about 1,200 km long, of which bus lines account for 775 Iam, trams for 157 Iam,&#13;
metro lines for 35 km, suburban rail for 110 km, trolley-buses for 68 km, and river ships&#13;
account for 20 km. Some 95% of urban locations are within 400 m from the nearest public&#13;
transport stop and BKV boasts of reducing the average waiting time to 3 minutes. The capacity&#13;
offered is 26,620 million space-km, broken down by mode as follows: 10,180 (38%) buses,&#13;
6,380 (24%) metro, 5,260 (20%) tramway and cog-wheel, 3,950 (15 %) suburban trains, and 850&#13;
(3 %) trolley buses. In line with arrangements made within the COMECON trading block, buses&#13;
are of Hungarian manufacture, trams are from Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and metro cars are&#13;
from Soviet Union.&#13;
2.          At the end of 1993, BKV had 19,320 employees, a decrease of about 2,000 from&#13;
1992. The staff reduction was achieved through a decrease in the total number of employees&#13;
and an increase in the number of drivers. The increase in the number of drivers, which was&#13;
unexpected given BKV's cut in services, was due to a change in the overtime laws that now&#13;
allow only 12 hours of overtime monthly instead of 50 hours, and an increase in the number of&#13;
vehicles by 521 in 1993. Some 5,295 employees are involved in traffic operations and another&#13;
9,934 are manual workers, the remaining 4,091 are white-collar employees. The company is&#13;
organized into directorates, four of which are defined by mode, and four are typical central&#13;
departments. A mechanical/construction services directorate, employing some 2,000 staff,&#13;
represents a heritage from the time when BKV's external purchases were limited to buying&#13;
vehicles and fuel. BKV has gone through several cycles of organizational development, from&#13;
greater independence of modally-defined departments to a highly centralized system. The&#13;
current trend is towards greater decentralization and the divestiture of non/operational units. For&#13;
instance, the BKV light vehicle fleet renewal has been awarded by an international tender to a&#13;
foreign car manufacturer, Renault, who also has a maintenance contract for these cars. The&#13;
expected result is to increase the car availability and thus to reduce this light vehicle fleet from&#13;
520 vehicles to 400 vehicles (a 23% decrease).&#13;
&#13;

3.          The 1991 daily traffic was about 4.4 million passengers and 19.4 million&#13;
passenger-km, adding up to 1,620 million passengers and 7,065 million passenger-km annually.&#13;
About two-third of all trips are work-related. The patronage trend is downward, accompanying&#13;
a similar trend in the capacity supplied:&#13;

BKV's patronage and the supply of transport decreased by about 24% during the seven year&#13;
period.&#13;
4.          BKV's fare system includes single tickets for all modes, plus daily, weekly and&#13;
monthly passes for different modal networks. Only 19% of fare revenue comes from selling&#13;
single tickets, with monthly passes -for tram only or combined for all modes- being the most&#13;
popular with 66% of the total fare revenue. Discounted passes are available to retirees and&#13;
students.&#13;
5.          BKV reports that, based on recent samples of vehicles, the percentage of&#13;
passengers riding without tickets has increased to about 12%. This percentage is bound to&#13;
increase further after the implementation of the 33% tariff increase on March 1, 1995 unless&#13;
corrective action is taken promptly. BKV is experiencing difficulties in tackling this rapidly&#13;
growing problem as it is not empowered to take effective action against defaulters. However,&#13;
BKV has increased the number of ticket controllers by about 150 in 1993 to 300 in 1994, and&#13;
is in the process of improving methodology for measuring fare evasion.&#13;
6.          The seven issues of urban transport in Budapest that involve BKV are: (a) aged&#13;
and obsolete plant; (b) company size; (c) link between productivity and remuneration; (d) the&#13;
size of the service network; (e) fare policy in the shrinking market; (f) finance sources; and (g)&#13;
formal status of BKV as enterprise.&#13;
Aged/obsolete plant&#13;
7.          The maintenance and upgrading of a plant as extensive as that of BKV requires&#13;
capital expenditures in excess of what has been available in recent years, especially since the low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
cost recovery of the company, its falling demand, and absence of financial management&#13;
techniques common elsewhere, placed such a heavy burden on public finances. The result has&#13;
been that BKV fell behind in its plant investments and in its maintenance program, as readily&#13;
visible from the poor state of tramway tracks, or the near-collapsed Millenium Underground&#13;
Line. Moreover, the technology is not up to the normal standards of Western European&#13;
countries. Because of the trading agreements between Eastern European (COMECON)&#13;
countries, including a rather extreme division of labor, purchasing of the rolling stock and other&#13;
equipment took place strictly inside the COMECON market, most often from a monopoly&#13;
supplier. For example, aU BKV buses came from Ikarus, a Hungarian manufacturer. Metro&#13;
cars are Soviet-made, and tramway cars were imported from Czechoslovakia (CKD Praha).&#13;
This practice had some advantages of standardization and economies of scale, but it also meant&#13;
that: (a) technological advances from the West were slow to come to Eastern Europe, in part&#13;
because of the difficulty of a gradual introduction of improvements from another technological&#13;
pool, and (b) the concept (and advantages) of competitive bidding has been largely unknown.&#13;
The consequences included lower vehicle productivity, higher operating and maintenance costs,&#13;
and higher environmental costs. As market conditions change, BKV will have to make some&#13;
difficult decisions, e.g. where to buy the replacement technology.  Not only have the&#13;
COMECON arrangements broken down, but the traditional COMECON suppliers are now&#13;
asking their hitherto special customers for payment in hard currencies and their prices have gone&#13;
up. Even the survival of some suppliers is in question. BKV is looking into new control&#13;
technology for some of its underground lines, but this is inextricably linked with the question&#13;
of future rolling stock purchases; also, environmental considerations would dictate the purchase&#13;
of "clean" buses or bus engines, but the pressure to help the domestic producer of buses is&#13;
strong.&#13;
The size of BKV&#13;
8.          BKV is altogether too large and has too large a scope of intemal activities, a&#13;
consequence of a trend towards self-sufficiency characteristic of the socialist economies.&#13;
Shortages of industrial products, large or small, were habitual, partly because of the poor&#13;
functioning of the command economies, partly due to a conviction held by central planners that&#13;
demand should always be left to exceed supply. In public transport, a sensitive urban service&#13;
where breakdowns could not be tolerated, managers responded by setting up internal units for&#13;
the manufacture of needed items. This may have started as a wish to maintain a stock of vital&#13;
spare parts, but it grew to a point where public transport companies in some Eastern European&#13;
cities bought very few goods and services from outside. BKV is not as extreme a case as some,&#13;
but it has too many internal departments for production of items that any Western company&#13;
would always buy on the market. It has developed activities that had nothing to do with public&#13;
transport, e.g. health services, sports centers, construction departments to build own housing,&#13;
gardening, etc. The number of staff working for these activities is presented in Table 2.&#13;
Needless to say, this represents a hefty addition to both fixed and variable costs of operation,&#13;
and reduces the company's ability to adapt to changes, such as a downturn in demand. BKV's&#13;
management estimates that BKV's optimal size would be around 18,000 by year 2000.&#13;
&#13;

However, whereas the first lay-offs - which were often early retirements in a context of a still&#13;
low unemployment - did not create any social turmoil, the coming ones may prove to be&#13;
difficult. It will require a combination of separating noncore activities and non/replacement of&#13;
retirees.&#13;

Link between productivity and remuneration&#13;
9.          Until recently, less than 30% of BKV's revenues came from fares, the rest being&#13;
subsidies traditionally paid by the state government, and the link between internal productivity&#13;
and remuneration of staff has been weak. The subsidy formula was based on place-km put into&#13;
service and total number of boardings. This formula has now been abandoned and the subsidy&#13;
amount from the municipal budget is actually a function of BKV's forecast deficit. Still, BKV's&#13;
operational (transport) departments have efficiency ratios comparable to Western European&#13;
transport enterprises, but excess staff are found in the central and service departments, which&#13;
lowers overall results of the enterprise.&#13;
The size of BKV's service network.&#13;
10.         Exceptionally low fares have encouraged Budapest citizens to use more of public&#13;
transport services than they otherwise might have. In the short run, this means that frequency&#13;
of trips was high; in the longer run, low fares influenced the location of housing and other land&#13;
uses, leading to progressively longer journeys. Since BKV's service standards were driven by&#13;
a normative political process rather than economic calculation, the result is that the network is&#13;
quite extensive, possibly more so than in any other world city. This is a situation difficult to&#13;
maintain in times of relative economic hardship. BKV appears to have reacted by reducing&#13;
frequency of service, rather than eliminating the lines or considering work-sharing with&#13;
alternative providers of service. However recent drop in demand, and rising awareness of the&#13;
necessity of higher cost recovery ratio have changed this attitude and BKV has submitted a plan&#13;
to the Municipality that includes further reduction in off peak services, reduction by 3 hours of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

services is provided. This plan is considered by BKV's management as a first step, and other&#13;
line closures are studied, but it has not yet received the approval of the Municipality. The&#13;
Municipality and BKV are also studying other alternatives such as better coordination with the&#13;
existing providers of transport services, Volanbusz and MAV, through a Budapest Transport&#13;
Association, and private provision of public transport on a trial basis.&#13;
Fare policy in the shrnking market&#13;
11.         Using a basic-needs approach, BKV fares have been kept quite low. This meant&#13;
large payments of operating subsidies to the company, in addition to capital subsidies for large-&#13;
scale infrastructure investments and also rolling stock purchases. This continued until macro-&#13;
economic constraints dictated belt tightening. The first fare increase in BKV's history took place&#13;
in 1985, the next one in 1989, the increases becoming annual thereafter. Traffic started to fall&#13;
at an annual rate of 4.5% since 1987, further eroding both the fare revenue and the traffic-&#13;
dependant part of subsidies. This has been a joint result of higher fares, generally higher costs&#13;
of living for some segments of the population, higher unemployment, and a shift to using private&#13;
vehicles by the well-to-do passengers. BKV faces some difficult choices. Fares policy is under&#13;
pressure, since the current cost recovery ratio (34%) is substantially under the European average&#13;
(about 50%), but it will inevitably lead to further erosion in the patronage. Some of the "lost"&#13;
trips will shift to cars and others will be made by walking, or not at all. This is not necessarily&#13;
bad, not even some shift to private cars, since this is a part and parcel of the economic growth&#13;
and increase in the standard of living. Still, it has to be handled with great care, lest it leads&#13;
to the car-dominant situation prevalent in most European cities. Fares are not the only action&#13;
needed to increase cost recovery. With more than 10% of traffic riding without ticket, a fare&#13;
evasion reduction to 7% would provide a significant additional revenue. There is a lot of scope&#13;
in BKV to reduce operating costs, not only by serving the existing network better but also by&#13;
reducing the service network. This last does not necessarily mean the cessation of service, but&#13;
giving opportunity to the private sector to take over parts of the network, particularly the lower-&#13;
volume routes.&#13;
Finance sources&#13;
12.         In 1986, the revenue from BKV ticket sales covered only 19% of total operating&#13;
costs (23% of direct operating costs). Since BKV had additional business ventures, "other"&#13;
revenues increased cost recovery to 28 % of total costs. At that time, a combination of city and&#13;
state subsidies was paid according to a formula with an in-built performance incentive: a&#13;
"supply" subsidy from Budapest City Council of HUF 160 (then US$ 3) for each passenger-&#13;
space-km per year in service, plus a "demand" subsidy from the State (Ministry of Finance),&#13;
amounting to twice the traffic revenue earned by the BKV. These numbers excluded the capital&#13;
subsidy, which in the early 1980's was of the order of $30 million per annum. In 1990, when&#13;
cost recovery increased to 34% through fare increases, the subsidy amounted to HUF 11,197&#13;
million ($ 177 million). This was equivalent to 0.5% of the Gross Domestic Product of&#13;
Hungary in that year, and also amounted to about 15% of the total revenues of the City of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Budapest. A new system has been introduced, starting in 1991, whereby the Ministry of Finance&#13;
is paying a compensation for "social" fares, while the Municipality of Budapest, owner of BKV&#13;
since that time, gives a fixed-amount subsidy subject to negotiation. In 1992, revenue from&#13;
ticket sales was about HUF 6,835 million and another HUF 688 million came from advertising&#13;
and other services. The cost recovery ratio, including depreciation, was 32% in 1992. The&#13;
68% gap between total costs and sales revenues is covered by subsidies from the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and from the Municipality of Budapest. In 1991, the subsidy from the Government&#13;
came to HUF 3,214 million and municipal subsidy came to HUF 9,580 million. In 1993, the&#13;
subsidy was HUF 11,377 million from the municipal budget and about HUF 4,940 million from&#13;
the Central Govemment; the actual amount of the latter is proportionate to the actual number&#13;
of concessionary tickets sold. Fare increases should enable BKV to achieve a 100% operating&#13;
ratio, if strong actions are decided against ticketless riders.&#13;
13.         Various attempts to modify public transportation fares in the Budapest area are&#13;
on their way. The EBRD financed a restructuring study of BKV's fares, which started in June,&#13;
1993, and the Municipality will present a new fare structure with its implementation schedule.&#13;
The Budapest Transport Association, created on January 1, 1995, would, among other tasks,&#13;
promote a unified fare system for all public transportation systems in the region.&#13;
14.         The financial analysis of BKV's past accounts, shows that, after an accounting&#13;
deficit of HUF 370 million in 1991, the operating ratio went down from 101.7% in 1991, to&#13;
99.5% in 1992, and then increased to 101% in 1993. It is estimated the operating ratio will&#13;
increase to 104% in 1994. BKV's compliance with the financial targets set in the Second&#13;
Transport Project has been reasonably good prior to 1991. Financial projections for the years&#13;
1995 to 2000 were prepared, analyzed and discussed during appraisal (Annexes 6 to 9).&#13;
Status of BKV.&#13;
15.         BKV was transformed from a state enterprise into a Municipal enterprise,&#13;
belonging to the Municipality of Budapest, pursuant to Resolution Number 1608/1992 dated&#13;
December 23, 1992, and amended on November 30, 1993. The Hungarian law on the&#13;
transformation of state property requires the new status to be in place by December 31, 1996.&#13;
However, the Municipality and BKV signed an Operational Agreement in January 1995. BKV&#13;
will become a public company operating under commercial law, with joint ownership of stock&#13;
held by the Municipality of Budapest, BKV employees. Other stockholders could enter later.&#13;
The final propositions concerning the assets' ownership, the distribution of shares and the&#13;
division of powers and responsibilities between the shareholders and the management are yet to&#13;
be developed.&#13;

Assumptions Used in Financial Projection&#13;
1.          The forecasts for 1995 through 2000 are in mid-1994 price levels. Conversions&#13;
from forints to US dollars for projections was at the mid-1994 level of US$1.00 = HUF103.0.&#13;
2.          Traffic was projected to decrease by 4% per annum covering a 1% change in&#13;
model split and a 3 % decrease due to real tariff increases. Tariffs were increased in real terms&#13;
by 10% in 1996, 9% in 1997, 10% in 1998, 5% in 1999, and 10% in 2000 to enable BKV to&#13;
meet the increased cost recovery rates of 37% in 1995, 41% in 1996, 43% in 1997, 45% in&#13;
1998, 47% in 1999 and 50% for 2000 onwards. VAT was not included in revenue. Fare&#13;
evasion is projected to be reduced from 12% in 1993 to 7% by 1997.&#13;
3.          Municipal subsidies were reduced in line with the increase in tariffs to a level&#13;
which enabled BKV to break even on operating expenses including depreciation but excluding&#13;
interest on long-term loans.&#13;
4.          Salaries were decreased in line with the BKV's projected decrease in staff&#13;
numbers during the six-year period 1995-2000.&#13;
5.          Energy prices were assumed to increase by 2%  in real terms in 1995 and&#13;
thereafter to remain at the 1995 level. Fuel consumption was decreased as new vehicles were&#13;
delivered. Reductions were also made to allow for the reduction in service expected as a result&#13;
of the fall in traffic and use of a more reliable new vehicle.&#13;
6.          Material costs were reduced in line with the savings expected from the acquisition&#13;
of new vehicles and the reduction in fleet.&#13;
7.          Other worling expenses were mainly related to staffing levels and were projected&#13;
in line with salaries and wages.&#13;
8.          About 15% of total operating expenses were capitalized based on the 1994 level.&#13;
9.          Existing depreciation rates, which are conservative, were used on assets acquired&#13;
prior to 1994. Buses acquired from 1995 onwards were depreciated over ten years in line with&#13;
projected useful life instead of five to seven years life used by BKV.&#13;

10.         It was assumed that BKV would be responsible for debt service on the Bank loan&#13;
only.&#13;
11.         No equity contributions from the municipality or state were assumed.&#13;

BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Buses&#13;
1.           In the operating and financial environment prevalent in Western Europe and&#13;
North America, evaluation of bus replacement proposals normally consists of life cycle cost&#13;
calculations to determine an optimal replacement age for a batch of vehicles. If a new model&#13;
of bus is considered, the differing capital, operating and maintenance costs, and expected&#13;
lifetime of the old and new models are compared. Improved environmental characteristics,&#13;
difficult to quantify but frequently mandated by law, may be considered, as well as the&#13;
advantages of buying locally manufactured buses. The preparation of specifications and bid&#13;
documents, and the bid evaluation process, is particularly important because new vehicles&#13;
have a wide range of cost and performance possibilities.&#13;
2.           In the case of BKV's bus fleet, financial constraints have prevented the&#13;
enterprise from retiring and replacing vehicles in accordance with life cycle calculations.&#13;
Focussing on the main work-horse of BKV's fleet, the standard-size, Ikarus-made 200 series&#13;
bus, 36% of the existing BKV fleet is older than the optimal replacement life of eight years.&#13;
Ikarus has recently introduced a new 400 series of buses.&#13;
3.           The procurement of 50 single buses' was evaluated by comparing the capital&#13;
and operating costs of the bus fleet with and without the accelerated replacement financed&#13;
under the project, as shown in Attachment 1. The principal assumptions used in the&#13;
calculation are:&#13;
(a)   Ikarus 200 series buses would be replaced with buses made to meet the&#13;
currently planned specification, including an expected life of at least 12 years,&#13;
at a net of tax cost of US$250,000 equivalent.&#13;
(b)    The analysis period is ten years. The residual value of the fleet, was&#13;
estimated on a straight line basis over 12 years.&#13;
(c)    Buses would cost US$11,000 to maintain in the first year. The maintenance&#13;
costs of the buses would increase thereafter in accordance with the different&#13;
cost profiles shown in Attachment 1 which are based on discussions with BKV&#13;
specialists.&#13;
l /The number of buses included in the project was reduced from 150 to 50 at negotiations. The ERR estimate in this Annex is based on&#13;
procuring 150 buses in 1994 and 1995, and is considered to be essentially the same as for procuring 50 buses in 1996 as finally agreed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
(d)   The new bus fleet would require only 10% spare buses. This compares to&#13;
27 % required for the present 200 series fleet due to their age and low&#13;
reliability.&#13;
(e)   The 200 series buses would consume an average of 0.32 liters/km and the new&#13;
buses 0.29 liters/km of diesel fuel at an international price of US$ 0.30/liter&#13;
excluding taxes. Buses would run 65,000 km p.a.&#13;
(f)    The fleet in service would decline 4% p.a. during 1993-2000 in parallel with&#13;
the traffic forecast. The ratio of single to tandem busses would remain the&#13;
same,&#13;
(g)   BKV bought fifteen new buses with its own funds in 1994, and will buy none&#13;
in 1995 and 1996, and 100 p.a. from 1997 onwards (their historical average).&#13;
They would also buy 130 new buses in 1995 and 130 in 1996 with EBRD&#13;
financing.&#13;
Based on these assumptions, the ERR for this component is estimated to be 17% as shown in&#13;
Attachment 1. The evaluation does not take account of the increased attractiveness and&#13;
comfort of new buses, or reductions in air pollution. If the buses cost 20% more than&#13;
estimated, then the ERR of this component is estimated to be 14%. If traffic declines 6.0%&#13;
p.a. during 1993-2000 instead of 4.0% p.a. the ERR would be 14%.&#13;
B. Tram Track&#13;
4.          At present, BKV tramway tracks are of two types: big panel track, embedded&#13;
in the roadway to permit road vehicles to use it, and open track, the traditional rail track&#13;
with sleepers and ballast on an exclusive right of way. Recently, BKV has experimented&#13;
with a new type of surface track, using continuous reinforced concrete base, cast in-situ,&#13;
heavy rail (RI59 type, designed for 12-ton axle loads), and flexible base plates. The new&#13;
track is projected to have a useful life of 25 years, with a rail change after 15 years. BKV&#13;
has identified track sections for urgent replacement on the basis of condition and traffic&#13;
loading, but lacks funds to do the work. The highest priority 47 km, expected to be almost&#13;
all big panel track, would be financed under the project, at an average cost of US$960,000&#13;
per km net of tax including 10% physical contingencies.&#13;
5.          BKV does not keep records of track maintenance costs by track type or traffic&#13;
loading. During 1981-88, BKV spent about US$17.7 million equivalent p.a. on regular&#13;
maintenance including a small amount for locally funded renewal. These expenditures then&#13;
declined steadily to about US$7.0 million in 1992 (para. 8), resulting in the deterioration of&#13;
the system described in the main text. It is estimated that if the track system is to be&#13;
retained at its present size and average technical condition, then expenditure on regular&#13;
maintenance would have to rise back to the level of the 1980's, and a program of backlog&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
maintenance undertaken. It is further estimated that BKV would extend the life of existing&#13;
big panel tracks from 8 to 12 years by undertaking a program of rail grinding and panel&#13;
filling. This program is expected to reduce the annual requirement for regular maintenance&#13;
from US$17.7 million (1981-88 average) to US$12.7 million. It was assumed that BKV&#13;
would increase its maintenance budget in steps to US$12.7 million p.a. by 1997 to meet this&#13;
requirement.&#13;
6.          BKV has a total of about 269 km of track network carrying passengers,&#13;
including 84 km carrying more than 40,000 passengers per day (ppd), 125 kIn carrying 12-&#13;
40,000 ppd, and 60 kan carrying less than 12,000 ppd. It is estimated that the maintenance&#13;
expenditures per kan are distributed in the proportion of 4:2:1 among these three categories.&#13;
On this basis, the required maintenance budget of US$12.7 million in 1997 would be&#13;
US$6.7, US$4.8 and US$1.1 million respectively for the three categories. Thirty percent of&#13;
maintenance expenditures are estimated to be fixed, and 70% to vary in proportion to traffic.&#13;
Considering that 55% of the network is big panel track, and assuming, based on international&#13;
experience, that it costs about 1.5 times as much to maintain big panel track as open track,&#13;
then the annual maintenance requirement for big panel track carrying 30,000 ppd or more&#13;
can be expressed by the equation: US$1,120 per km plus US$1,400 per 1000 ppd.&#13;
7.          Maintenance costs are expected to fall substantially when the new track is put&#13;
in place. Taking into account that the project includes the sections which are in the worst&#13;
condition and carry the most traffic, it is estimated, based on international norms, that&#13;
regular maintenance costs would fall by 65 % when big panel track is replaced with new&#13;
surface track.&#13;
8.         In the absence of the project, BKV would also have to undertake an intensive&#13;
program of backlog maintenance, including extensive repairs particularly to remove speed&#13;
restrictions, rail replacement, and the panel grouting and rail grinding program described&#13;
above. This would be necessary to avoid the imposition of additional speed restrictions and&#13;
assure the tracks could be maintained from the regular maintenance budget. Backlog&#13;
maintenance requirements for the entire track system are estimated to be the difference&#13;
between actual and required maintenance during the period 1989-97, based on the parameters&#13;
discussed in para. 5.&#13;

Estimated backlog maintenance of US$50.7 million amounts to an average of US$189,000&#13;
per track km that carry passengers. Since project tracks carry the most traffic and are in&#13;
the worst condition, it was assumed they would require double this amount, or $378,000 per&#13;
km.&#13;
9.          Trams will no longer have to brake for and accelerate away from sections with&#13;
speed restrictions following the project. Rehabilitation of 64 km of heavily trafficked track&#13;
would result in an estimated 1.5% savings in energy costs, or about US$95,000 p.a. in 1993.&#13;
In addition, it is estimated that fewer trams would be required which would reduce the tram&#13;
maintenance and refurbishment bill by around US$375,000, while the reduction in tram&#13;
drivers would reduce the wage bill by a further US$250,000.&#13;
10.         The economic rate of return (ERR) calculation is shown in Attachment 2.&#13;
Annual operating cost savings, and the variable portion of maintenance cost savings, are&#13;
assumed to vary in proportion to the traffic forecast. The estimated ERRs for identified&#13;
sections are as follows:&#13;

Total                  37.3&#13;
11.          Assuming the remaining sections have an ERR of 10%, the track renewal&#13;
component is estimated to have an ERR of 23%. The evaluation does not take into account&#13;
travel time savings, increased passenger comfort and attractiveness, the expected 50%&#13;
reduction in ambient noise, or the expected reduction in building damage from tram&#13;
vibration. If the cost of track renewal is 20% higher than estimated, then the ERR of this&#13;
component would be 15%. If traffic declines 6.0% p.a. during 1993-2000 instead of 4.0%&#13;
p.a. the ERR would be 22%.&#13;
C. Traffic Control System&#13;
12.          An additional 50 trams and 150 buses would be equipped with AVM at a cost&#13;
US$3.2 million net of tax under the project.2  AVM system maintenance costs were&#13;
estimated on the basis of international experience to be 1.8% of the capital cost in the first&#13;
year, 1.4% in the years 2-5, rising to 2.5% in the 17th year when the system would be&#13;
scrapped. Other AVM operating costs were estimated to be 4.0% of current average vehicle&#13;
operating costs. Based on results in other countries, it is possible to operate AVM equipped&#13;
tram or bus services with 7-10% fewer vehicles. Due to apparent excess capacity in the tram&#13;
fleet, and in order to be conservative, it was assumed that the purchase of only 3% of the&#13;
2 /The number of ums and buses to be fitted with AVM equipmcnt under the project was reduced from 300 to 200 at negotiations. Tbe&#13;
ERR estimate in this Annex is based on equipping 300 trams and buses in 1996, and is considered to be essentially the same as for&#13;
equipping 200 trams and buses in 1997 as fuudly agreed under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
AVM equipped vehicles could be avoided in the second year of operation. It was also&#13;
assumed that due the more even distribution of vehicles on the line, the same level of service&#13;
could be provided with 3% less vehicle capacity, resulting in a savings in operating costs.&#13;
Finally, an AVM system is expected to reduce the net requirement for dispatchers by 10&#13;
persons at an estimated annual cost of US$42,000 including overheads. The ERR for this&#13;
component is estimated to be 19% as shown in Attachment 3. Benefits from reductions in&#13;
fuel consumption or vehicle maintenance due to smoother running, or increased passenger&#13;
satisfaction due to improved adherence to the timetable, were not taken into account. If the&#13;
cost of the AVM system is 20% higher than expected, the ERR is estimated to be 13%. The&#13;
calculation is not considered to be sensitive to the traffic forecast, since only about 17% of&#13;
the combined bus/tram fleet will be equipped with AVM following completion of the project.&#13;
All of these vehicles are expected to continue in service irrespective of traffic developments.&#13;

BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
A. Prject Obiectives&#13;
1.          The overall objective of the project is to support the urban transport reforms&#13;
undertaken by the Municipality of Budapest and BKV. Specific objectives are to: (a) modernize&#13;
and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; (b) implement a parking control policy; (c)&#13;
decrease subsidies to BKV by reducing operating costs, increasing tariffs and separating non-core&#13;
activities, and by introducing the private provision of public transport services; (d) contribute&#13;
to the improvement of environment protection in Budapest.&#13;
B. Project Descrption&#13;
2.          The Project includes three investment components to be implemented by BKV,&#13;
plus policy components and related technical assistance to be implemented by BKV and the&#13;
Municipality of Budapest. The investment components comprise:&#13;
(a)   47 km of tram track in most urgent need of repair will be replaced on the most heavily&#13;
travelled routes over a three year period. In addition, this component includes small&#13;
equipment: (i) instruments to diagnose track condition; (ii) maintenance machines and&#13;
tools; and (iii) a computer-controlled maintenance supervision system;&#13;
(b)   50 single buses will be purchased; and&#13;
(c)   Stage II of the implementation of an automatic vehicle monitoring system will provide&#13;
on-board equipment for 200 vehicles.&#13;
Technical assistance is described in Attachment 1.&#13;
C. EPject Cost&#13;
3.          The total project cost is estimated to be US$67.1 million, including US$38&#13;
million in foreign exchange (Attachment 2).&#13;
&#13;

D. Implementation and Monitorin&#13;
4.          Municipality.  The Municipality of Budapest will be the Borrower.  The&#13;
Municipality is the sole owner of BKV and has the legal authority on urban transport, including&#13;
fare levels and service definition. The Municipality will be responsible for developing and&#13;
implementing the policy reforms for the project which are within its jurisdiction, as detailed in&#13;
a Municipal Action Plan shown in Attachment 3. The Municipality and BKV will agree on how&#13;
the proceeds of the Bank loan will be made available to BKV and how BKV will pay back this&#13;
contribution of the City. The signature of this agreement will be a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
5.          BKV. BKV will be responsible for implementing the four investment components&#13;
of the project as well as policy components within its jurisdiction.  An action plan covering&#13;
BKVs responsibilities is shown in Attachment 4.&#13;
6.          Project Implementation Unit.  The World Bank and EBRD projects are&#13;
complementary, and a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was established at the time of the&#13;
EBRD loan under terms of reference shown in Attachment 5. The PIU is operating effectively.&#13;
In order to simplify the administration of the two projects, the PIU would also help administer&#13;
World Bank project in accordance with the requirements of the Loan, Project and Guarantee&#13;
Agreements and Agreed Minutes of Negotiations, with the following clarifications/additions to&#13;
the PIU terms of reference:&#13;
(a)   Since a primary project objective is to increase BKV's commercial orientation, BKV will&#13;
independently manage its components of the project under the overall responsibility of&#13;
the PIU and Municipality. This will include carrying out its own procurement&#13;
(preparation of bidding documents, prequalification, bid evaluation, recommendation or&#13;
selection of contractors/suppliers signing the contracts, and full implementation of the&#13;
project).&#13;
(b)   The PIU would prepare quarterly reports on the progress of the works (Attachment 8)&#13;
and semiannual progress reports on the project following receipt of the January-June and&#13;
July-December financial positions of the project. The progress reports would report on&#13;
progress in achieving the Municipal Action Plan (Attachment 3), and the BKV Action&#13;
Plan (Attachment 4).&#13;
(c)   The PIU would administer the World Bank Special Account; and&#13;
(d)   relevant references to the European Bank are understood to refer to both the World Bank&#13;
and European Bank.&#13;
&#13;

7.          Procurement arrangements are shown in Attachment 7.&#13;
F. Disbursements. Accounts and Audits&#13;
8.          Based on the loan becoming effective in 1995, a schedule of estimated&#13;
disbursements was established (Attachment 9).&#13;
9.          To maintain an adequate flow of funds for eligible project expenditures with a&#13;
minimum of administrative delay, the Borrower will establish a Special Account (revolving fund)&#13;
at a bank of its choice, sufficient to cover up to 4 months of loan expenditures (i.e. about US$3&#13;
million). Records of the Special Account proceeds and outlays would be available for review&#13;
by the Bank's supervision missions and subject to annual audit.&#13;
11.         BKV will establish and maintain project related accounts. Such accounts shall be&#13;
maintained in accordance with recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. BKV will provide quarterly financial reports (Attachment 6) and annual financial&#13;
statements to reflect the financial performance and the position of BKV and the project, from&#13;
the commencement of the project execution. An auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank on such statements, will be provided within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
The foregoing project accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide&#13;
adequate and timely information to the Bank for supervision of the project.&#13;

2. Improvement of productivity&#13;
Owing to the predictable lack of substantial incmase of funds it is&#13;
necessary to implement a conscientious and planned reduction&#13;
simultaneously with the maintenance or improvement of quality.&#13;
This should be based on the dedicatadnees of the company towvard the&#13;

fur columns of the mass transport of the city of Budapest namely,&#13;
the balanced reltion, harmony of the city, the passenger. the travel&#13;
process and the operating company.&#13;
Therefore, to avoid the spontaneous implementation of the currntly&#13;
reducing share of mass transport, deternined teps should be&#13;
required in changing the travel process. in setting the ratio of travel&#13;
modes it is exedient to enforce these by the   tm of relaions&#13;
improving the efflciency of the company and enhancing the level of&#13;
public tansport services. To attain the"e the following package of&#13;
measures is recommended:&#13;

provide more reliability and traffic stability)&#13;
- Correladon of timetables for the sake of ataining more&#13;
favourable line change possibilities&#13;
- Complex measures enforcing the prioriry of masu transport&#13;
- E2teuion of the mas transport netwvrk of the reduced trafflc&#13;
road 2rea&#13;
- Improvement of the level of traffic and the fullilment of&#13;

It should be attained that only such vork be included in the&#13;
investment plan and implemented the decidsion for which are&#13;
supported by prvious calculations.&#13;
For the sace of this, the particular area should be defined - as l Iimit&#13;
value or the chxacter of the fixed aset - in which case prwvious&#13;
economic analysis is required&#13;
A limit value sholld be defined above which only those v s should&#13;
be included in the plnsu vhich vere screened by the previous&#13;
arnalyses and ae in complianc with the 10%/ pfitability crierion&#13;
dscribed by the World Bank.&#13;
Prom this am those invegtment types should be asigned in detail for&#13;
which the 10X profitability expectation can be disregarded becuue of&#13;
the character of the work: examples of this are envhronent&#13;
protection projects or, occasionally, social uelfhre investmants, eta.&#13;
It is important to stres - together with the cirmsmtanoe that the typ&#13;
of calculations and the defiLnition of the components to be&#13;
investigated will be done at the time prescribed in the tak plan -, that&#13;
the investment projecs should be anabled according to their entire&#13;
estimates of expenditure sad these data should be compaeod with the&#13;
cost and revenue data relating to the expectable cost or renue data.&#13;
For woridag out these calculadons, those cost elements or revenue&#13;
types should be named in wvhich the result of the investment is&#13;
realizd through the investment work.&#13;
The rules of the evaluation of the investments should be worked out.  30 May 1995&#13;

ProDosal ror the Measurement method&#13;
of the number of Dassenfzers travelling vithout ticket&#13;
Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement of the Budapest Urban Transport Program to be&#13;
financed by the World Bank contains a provision on the Action Plan of the Budapest&#13;
Public Transport Company (BKV) including measures for the reduction of the ratio of&#13;
passengers traveling without ticket In the course of negotiation with the World Bank it&#13;
was found necessary to work out the measurement method of this ratio.&#13;
The aim of the survey is to provide to the Company reliable information on the variation&#13;
of the travels carried out with out ticket A fi2.ther aim is to gather detailed information&#13;
on the ticket acquisition behaviour of the passengers. The methods for the attainment of&#13;
these aims is given in detail in the following&#13;
1.   Statistical determination of the ratio of travels without ticket&#13;
On the vehicles of the BKV some 3.5 to 4 million travel trips are carried out. The ratio of&#13;
traveUing without ticket is determined with a statistical method on the base of a&#13;
representative sample. This representative sample extends to some 1% of the daily travel&#13;
tips in the following distribution:&#13;
An extemal firm carries out twice a year questioning-type polling - extending to 50,000&#13;
passengers in each case - independent of the BKV. It is expedient to carry out the two&#13;
data coHlections in the months March and September. This way, the distorting effects of&#13;
the less heavy summer traffic and the occasional repeated poling can be carried out&#13;
outside the sumnmer season.&#13;
On the ground of its own surveys, also the BKV processes twice a year by statistical&#13;
methods a sample obtained from the ticket control of 300,000 passengers. The basis of&#13;
tbis survey is the statistic figures of the ticket controllers. The numbers of fine events are&#13;
recorded and the ticket controUlers have to also count the numbers of the ispected&#13;
passengers. It is necessary to ensure the reliability of these infonnation by the company.&#13;
During the surveys the ticket controllers also have to record the numbers of those&#13;
passengers without ticket, where was not possible to fine them.&#13;
The typical figure for the ratio of travelling without ticket will be calculated with the&#13;
values obtained from the two kinds of data coUection - by the BKV and by the external&#13;
compaay - by statistical averaging&#13;
2.   Requirements for the tasks of the external firm (Terms of References)&#13;
The extemal firm carries out the survey independent of the BKV as follows:&#13;
a)   The querying should be effected over a period of one week, considering the day of&#13;
the week, the traffic volume, the number of travellers in the peak period and out of&#13;
it. The values relating to the sample should be within ±10% from these proportions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
-102-                                   Page 23 of 42&#13;
A deviatiou less than 1% does not require any correction, while over this value the&#13;
result should be corrected according to the actual weights, applying statistical&#13;
methods.&#13;
b)  The sample should be proportional also concerning the mass transport means used.&#13;
Explamiing this in more detaiL this means that among the 50,000 passeagers polled&#13;
approximately the same number should be the users of the different transport&#13;
means as in the company value calculated for the entire network of the BKV. The&#13;
BKV wil give these data to the external firm, - together with the daily trafc&#13;
volume and the peak period ratio - to facilitate the planning of the work. Regarding&#13;
the individual ratio figures, a deviation of maximum ±10% of the part concemed&#13;
can be accepted (e.g. in case of a part of 20%, a value between 18 and 22% is&#13;
permitted). In case of a deviation exceeding 1% the ratios obtained for the travels&#13;
without ticket should be recalculated corresponding to the shares given by the&#13;
BKV.&#13;
c)   The surveys should be conducted among the passengers waiting at the stops,&#13;
selecting the persons involved in a random manner. It is important to ask the&#13;
questions briefly, in a courteous manner and not to hold the people too long from&#13;
their trips unnecessarily. Before asking the questions the passengers should be&#13;
informed that it is n  a ticket control mad their answers will involve no sanctions.&#13;
d)  Ihe question should refer to what kind of ticket or season ticket does the passenger&#13;
use, occasionally he/she travels free of charge legally or just without ticket. The&#13;
answers should be grouped and during the questioning indicated on the data sheet&#13;
according to the following:&#13;
-  line ticket or colecting ticket;&#13;
- daily, tourist, week-end family or week-end child ticket;&#13;
-  7-day, 14-day or monthly ticket;&#13;
-  yearly ticket;&#13;
-  (company) travel card;&#13;
-  free of charge because of age (under school age or above 70);&#13;
- free of charge for other reason (e.g. blinds, reguIar soldiers, etc.)&#13;
-  travel without ticket;&#13;
-  refused to answer.&#13;
e)   The ratio of those traveling without ticket should be determined in the form of a&#13;
percentage relating to the entire sample, applying statisdcal methods. The external&#13;
firm will hand over also the basic data to the BKV, it wil be the property of the&#13;
latter.&#13;
3.   Handling of the deviation between the results of the BKV and those of the&#13;
external firm&#13;
If the percentage of the passengers travelling without ticket is at least the double or at&#13;
most the half of the respective data obtained by the BKV, then the investigation should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
-103-                                   Page 24 of 42&#13;
be repeated. In this case, the questioning should differ from the first instance im the&#13;
following:&#13;
-  the number of questioned persons should be 10,0000, instead of the former&#13;
50,000 persons, or&#13;
-  as far as possible, the questioning should be extended - keeping the&#13;
proportions of the differeat mass tansport means - to All the passengers&#13;
staying at the stop (ia this case several polling questioners should be sent to&#13;
the same stop)&#13;
Depending on the deviation of the ratios, these two changes can be required together (ia&#13;
case of very different figures obtained).&#13;
If even after the repeated questioning still a large deviation would remain, it should be&#13;
analyzed how accurate the data of theBKV are.&#13;

will include the procurement of rail as well as of civil work, and will be awarded under ICB&#13;
rules according to the Bank's guidelines. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for small&#13;
works will be used. Each package will include 2 or 3 bids. The bid size will encourage&#13;
local contractors and medium size contractors in neighboring countries to bid, while at the&#13;
same time offering the option to bid on several contracts in order to attract large foreign&#13;
contractors and encourage quantity discounts on material. The technical consistency of the&#13;
work will be maintained by not splitting a tram line into different contracts. The contract&#13;
size will range from about US$6 million to about US$20 million.&#13;

BUDAPEST URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference for Review of BKV's Information Management Needs&#13;
1.          BKV invites proposals from suitable qualified consultants to review their&#13;
existing accounting and data-processing systems and their proposed plan for future&#13;
development. The team of consultants might consist of two members, one versed in&#13;
accounting/finance and preferably with wide experience in municipal passenger transport&#13;
using a combination of buses, trollies, trams, and suburban rail service and a second with&#13;
experience in the new client/server architectures (but also with previous experience with&#13;
mainframe systems), database-management system (dbms) technology and knowledge of&#13;
industry and official standards in systems (like the standards around UNIX), PCs and&#13;
communications. The review and report writing is estimated to require six staff weeks.&#13;
2.          In particular, through discussions with BKV management and technical experts&#13;
and inspection of written plans (to the extent these are available), you will review BKV's&#13;
intentions for overhaul and further development of its information systems. Inter alia, the&#13;
report will:&#13;
3     summarize the current status of computerization at BKV;&#13;
3     describe in outline the business processes of BKV that could effectively&#13;
be supported by information systems and data bases;&#13;
*     evaluate scope and objectives of BKV's proposed information systems&#13;
project, i.e., organizations, processes and locations involved, and how&#13;
the project would address the known gaps/problems in data and&#13;
systems, particularly: (i) updated material and wage control system; (ii)&#13;
planning and costing repairs and maintenance; (iii) route costing; and&#13;
(iv) management information that would allow the monitoring of BKV's&#13;
business performance and management of its resources.&#13;
*     comment upon appropriateness and feasibility of BKV's ideas on&#13;
hardware architecture, operating system(s), networking, data base&#13;
management, software development tools and languages, use of off-the-&#13;
shelf application software versus own development, steps and&#13;
sequencing of the effort, and overall timetable, for arriving at a cost-&#13;
effective, comprehensive and integrated information architecture and&#13;
application systems;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123-&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
*     assess the adequacy of staff skills and financial resources available and&#13;
planned for the project; and&#13;
*     identify any missing prerequisites including studies or strategies, and&#13;
organizational measures that need to be in place for proper project&#13;
implementation, and draft terms of reference (TOR) for the necessary&#13;
assistance which BKV would require from consultants. This TOR&#13;
should be suitable for inviting proposals from a number of firms.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Budapest
            Urban Transport Project is to support the urban transport
            reforms undertaken by the City of Budapest and Budapest
            Transport Company (BKV). Specific objectives are to: 1)
            modernize and increase the commercial orientation of BKV; 2)
            implement a parking countrol policy; 3) decrease subsidies
            to BKV by reducing operating costs, increasing tariffs and
            separating noncore activities, and by introducing the
            private provision of public transport services; 4)
            contribute to the improvement of air quality in Budapest;
            and 5) establish a formal contractual relationship between
            BKV and the City of Budapest. The project will consist of:
            1) the replacement of 50 worn-out buses with low-polluting
            and energy-efficient substitutes; 2) the rehabilitation of
            about 47 km of wornout tramway tracks and the purchase of
            track maintenance equipment; 3) the second phase of an
            automatic vehicle monitoring system; and 4) technical
            assistance and training in financial management, economic
            evaluation of projects, marketing, organization, and
            technical issues.
