20            We come next to another item I would like to report&#13;
&#13;
21   on relating to the Indian economic studies.&#13;
&#13;
22            We have recently initiated some economic studies,&#13;
&#13;
23   a series of economic studies in India under the direction&#13;
&#13;
24   of Mr. Bernard Bell.&#13;
&#13;
25             Mr. Bell is an economist of high standing.   He is&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           c:   a professional economist associated with a firm domiciled&#13;
&#13;
                       Washington.      He and his firm have performed services&#13;
&#13;
                       Bank in the past.&#13;
&#13;
                          I might say in passing that I am hopeful that&#13;
&#13;
                things will work out so that Mr. Bell joins the Bank as a&#13;
&#13;
                regular member of our staff.     This is subject to various&#13;
&#13;
       1        checks, and so forth.     But it is entrain.&#13;
&#13;
       8                  b~.   Bell most recently was part, if not the head,&#13;
&#13;
       9        of a mission that made a study of the transportation system,&#13;
&#13;
   10           the Coal Transport system in India, with which some of you&#13;
&#13;
   11           are familiar.&#13;
&#13;
   12                     The studies Mr. Bell is now undertaking will&#13;
&#13;
   13           consist of (a) a set of specific inquiries directed toward&#13;
&#13;
   14           particular sectors and areas of the development effort,&#13;
&#13;
   15           selected because they are judged to be of critical importance&#13;
&#13;
   16           to the Indian economy; and (b) the use of the information&#13;
&#13;
   17           and understanding gained from these inquiries, together&#13;
&#13;
   18           with knowledge already available from other studies such&#13;
&#13;
   19           as the Energy Survey and the Coal Transport Study, to&#13;
&#13;
   20           provide a comprehensive assessment of the existing effort to&#13;
&#13;
   21           accelerate the growth of the Indian economy.      The study&#13;
&#13;
   22           is not intended as an appraisal of the Indian Government's&#13;
&#13;
   23           plans for the future as they will be embodied in the fourth&#13;
&#13;
   24           Five Year Plan.    Such an appraisal would be premature.&#13;
&#13;
   25           Rather the study is intended to provide the understanding of,&#13;
&#13;
INC.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              information about, the development effort to date which&#13;
&#13;
               be necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the Fourth&#13;
&#13;
               when the latter has been formulated.   The report of&#13;
&#13;
          the study will be made to me.&#13;
&#13;
                    I consider that we have been fortunate in getting&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Bell to undertake this task.   As I stated, he has a&#13;
&#13;
          distinguished record as an economist, and during the past&#13;
&#13;
          twelve months he has been working on the Indian Coal Transport&#13;
&#13;
          study, which we financed.&#13;
&#13;
                    Mr. Benjamin King, our resident representative in&#13;
          New Delhi, will be Mr. Bell's deputy in this study task&#13;
&#13;
          force, and will also devote most of his time to the study, as&#13;
&#13;
          will Mr. King's assistant in New Delhi, Mr. Pantanali.&#13;
&#13;
          There will be nine other members of the Bank's staff working&#13;
&#13;
          with Mr. Bell.&#13;
&#13;
                    In addition, with the cooperation of FAO, we have&#13;
&#13;
     17   managed to assemble a strong group of agricultural advisors,&#13;
&#13;
     18   which will be headed by Sir John Crawford, Director of the&#13;
&#13;
     19   Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National&#13;
&#13;
     20   University.   Those who know about these matters, know the&#13;
&#13;
     21   talent that is available in the world, are particularly&#13;
&#13;
     22   happy at the success in arranging for Sir John to take this&#13;
&#13;
     23   task on for us in India.&#13;
&#13;
     24             To help on the transport side, the Brookings&#13;
&#13;
     25   Institute here in Washington has agreed to release one of&#13;

&#13;
                            Mr. Bell is now in India and the team is assembling&#13;
                there.    They will be working throughout the winter, and I&#13;
&#13;
                bavea;ked Mr. Bell to schedule his operations, his assignments&#13;
&#13;
               and his studies in order to enable a report to me hopefully&#13;
&#13;
                byÂ· the end of March.   He thinks that this may be feasible.&#13;

&#13;
                in India that I have just spoken of?&#13;

            studies. The studies will consist of (a) a set of inquiries
            of particular development sectors judged to be of critical
            importance to the Indian economy; and (b) a comprehensive
            assessment of the existing effort to accelerate the growth
            of the Indian economy.
