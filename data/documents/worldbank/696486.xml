Health Sector Transition Project&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:               Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Beneficiary:            Ministry of Health (MOH), National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), National Institute&#13;
of Public Health (NIPH) and selected district health facilities.&#13;
Credit Amount:          SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent)&#13;
Tenns:                  Standard IDA; 35 years, including 10 years grace.&#13;
Project Obiectives:     The dual objective of the Health Sector Transition Project (HSTP) is to: (i) improve the&#13;
health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support&#13;
an initial phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and&#13;
patient choice within the health system.&#13;
Project DescriDtion:    Project objectives will be achieved through activities under the following three&#13;
components, each designed around a core policy agenda:&#13;
(i) Health Finance and Management (base cost US$3.8 million): The objective is to build&#13;
capacity to analyze and apply information for policy-making and health system&#13;
management. Support will be provided fortechnical studies, strengthening of management&#13;
skills in the MOH, NHIF and health facilities, and the development of management&#13;
information systems.&#13;
(ii) Basic Health Services (base cost US$7.0 million): The objective is to strengthen&#13;
primary health care and health promotion, particularly in rural areas. Support will be&#13;
provided to equip rural primary health care centers, upgrade skills of primary care&#13;
personnel and supply essential materials to five high-priority disease prevention programs.&#13;
(iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply (base cost US$5.7 million): The objective is to&#13;
reduce the cost of essential drugs through reforms which create a more competitive&#13;
pharmaceutical market. Essential drugs for primary care will be provided, along with&#13;
technical advice, training and equipment to improve public procurement, reimbursement&#13;
and quality control.&#13;
Total project cost is estimated at US$ 19.4 million equivalent (including contingencies).&#13;
This includes US$ 0.9 million to support establishment of an International Project Unit&#13;
(IPU) within the Ministry of Health (MOH) responsible for coordinating the&#13;
implementation of project activities. The Project will be implemented over three years&#13;
by the Ministry of Health and associated health institutions.&#13;
Project Benefits:       The economic benefits of the Project include better quality basic health services and a&#13;
more cost-effective use of public resources for health--both of which will counteract the&#13;
negative impact of recent economic and fiscal contraction on the health of the population.&#13;
Health Finance and Management: This component provides economic and fiscal benefits&#13;
through its impact on the allocation of public resources for health. It will result in a&#13;
reallocation of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, as well&#13;
as limitation of health expenditures to fiscally sustainable levels. The component&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
implements a basic benefits package for health insurance based on cost-effective treatment&#13;
of national health priorities, and tailored to available resources. It also creates incentives&#13;
for efficiency and quality of care, through the establishment of new provider payment&#13;
mechanisms; and improves resource management through strengthening of managerial&#13;
skills and provision of management tools.&#13;
Basic Health Services:  Cost-effective reduction in the burden of disease, through&#13;
improved preventive and curative primary care, is the major economic benefit of this&#13;
component. With continued high levels of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and&#13;
maternal mortality due to high-risk pregnancies, as well as rapidly rising premature&#13;
mortality due to chronic diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles, it is clear that&#13;
preventive and curative primary care is the most cost-effective way to reduce multiple&#13;
elements of the burden of disease. The component will result in adequately staffed and&#13;
equipped rural primary health care centers, and more effective reduction of the leading&#13;
causes of infant, child, maternal and other premature mortality through support for&#13;
national prevention programs.&#13;
Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply: The benefits of this component lie in its economy-&#13;
wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as the direct provision of essential&#13;
drugs for more effective primary care. Provision of drugs will be linked to reforms aimed&#13;
at increasing the affordability and availability of essential drugs. Legislative and&#13;
regulatory reform will ease market entry and create incentives to market lower-cost&#13;
drugs. Reform of public sector procurement and reimbursement procedures will lower&#13;
unit costs for drugs, and channel public resources toward more cost-effective drugs. The&#13;
economic and fiscal gains of the component far outweigh its economic costs, with fiscal&#13;
savings in the three-year period conservatively estimated at ten times the investment cost.&#13;
These large economic and fiscal benefits will continue beyond the life of the Project.&#13;
Prolect Risks:          The Project faces two key risks--one political, the other institutional. The political risk&#13;
is that the country cannot muster the political will necessary to implement fundamental&#13;
health sector reform, particularly with respect to limiting insurance benefits, squeezing&#13;
economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating the public sector&#13;
facilities network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing&#13;
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. To reduce this risk, the following&#13;
strategy has been pursued. First, technical working groups with broad stakeholder&#13;
participation were formed at an early stage for strategy formulation and project&#13;
preparation. Second, the project preparation team engaged in early interaction with the&#13;
media. Third, early efforts were made to market the emerging reform strategy to key&#13;
economic policymakers. Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in&#13;
the Project to support a vigorous communications strategy, in order to inform and&#13;
persuade major stakeholders.&#13;
A secondary risk lies in the weak institutional capacity of the MOH, and its limited&#13;
experience in implementation of internationally funded projects. The MOH has a direct&#13;
staff of only 25, with mostly medical--as opposed to managerial--training. To alleviate&#13;
this risk, the Project will invest heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH&#13;
and NHIF, as well as supplementing implementation capacity by providing local&#13;
management consultants to support the IPU. Although the reform agenda supported by&#13;
the Project is substantive, project investments are simple, and organized into a small&#13;
number of procurement packages. Medical equipment and drugs accounting for more&#13;
than 40 percent of the IDA credit will be procured by a local agent with sophisticated&#13;
infrastructure and a strong track record of international purchasing and local distribution.&#13;

I. HEALTH SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
Economic and Political Context&#13;
1.1            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the poorest republic in the&#13;
former federated state, has spent the five years since independence struggling to avoid internal conflict&#13;
and gain full political and economic recognition from the international community. The country has been&#13;
forced to address structural problems in the economy which it inherited from Yugoslavia, while external&#13;
forces--notably regional conflict, trade embargo and transport blockade-- severely constrained economic&#13;
performance. As a result, real income dropped by nearly 40 percent between 1990 and 1994, to an&#13;
estimated per capita GNP of only US$790 in 1994. The deterioration in living standards has been&#13;
exacerbated by an inevitable fiscal crisis, which has undermined the social safety net and provision of&#13;
social services. Now, with tentative resolution of the regional conflict, and lifting of the trade embargo&#13;
and transport blockade, FYR Macedonia can begin to move beyond the crisis stage, deepening the&#13;
structural reforms necessary for resumption of growth. Key to the success of economic reform and to&#13;
long run economic growth will be provision of a fiscally sustainable social safety net and the effective&#13;
development of human capital.&#13;
Health Status, Services and Financinrg'&#13;
1.2            By Central and Eastern European (CEE) standards, FYR Macedonia has a young&#13;
population and relatively high fertility rate, resulting in positive population growth. During the 1960-90&#13;
period, the population enjoyed steadily improving health status, with rapidly declining infant and maternal&#13;
mortality. The infant mortality rate dropped from 112 per 1,000 live births in 1961 to just 28 in 1991,&#13;
with life expectancy rising from 61 to 72 years. Since the advent of the transition, improvement in health&#13;
status has stagnated--a key issue for health sector reform, as discussed below. Although life expectancy&#13;
in FYR Macedonia falls below that in established market economies (EME) countries, it equals or exceeds&#13;
that in other CEE countries and far surpasses that in developing countries at similar income levels. While&#13;
life expectancy is on par with higher income CEE countries, the determinants differ considerably. Infant&#13;
mortality in FYR Macedonia is twice the CEE average, while premature adult death due to chronic&#13;
disease and injury is far lower. In short, the country is not as far along in the demographic and&#13;
epidemiologic transition as other CEE countries--with both positive and negative implications for health.&#13;

1.3             Real income growth was not the sole determinant of improving health status in past&#13;
decades. The health system also made a positive contribution, offering universal coverage, broad risk-&#13;
pooling, wide access to facilities, abundant and relatively well-trained personnel and effective public&#13;
health activities, such as immunization  and vector control.   FYR  Macedonia inherited a highly-&#13;
decentralized and locally-funded health system (based on the former "Self-managed Communities of&#13;
Interest") which tended toward fragmentation, duplication and interregional inequities in the quality of&#13;
care. The country was divided into 33 districts (five in the capital, Skopje), each of which had its own&#13;
network of facilities which were "socially owned" by health workers and communities. In 1994, these&#13;
socially-owned facilities were converted into a single network of public sector health facilities under the&#13;
supervision of the MOH. The 33 districts remain, with 17 medical centers (each a complex of secondary&#13;
hospital and outpatient polyclinic) and associated primary health care (PHC) centers. The country also&#13;
has 14 disease-specific or chronic care treatment hospitals, as well as a university complex of tertiary care&#13;
facilities in Skopje. The public sector network consists, on average, of a PHC center per 6.,000&#13;
inhabitants and a general secondary hospital per 110,000 inhabitants. Private health services were&#13;
authorized in 1991, and have grown most rapidly in pharmaceuticals (wholesale and retail) and dentistry,&#13;
where private expenditures tend to be concentrated.&#13;
1.4             To overcome regional inequities in the quality of care, and maximize risk-pooling for a&#13;
population of only 2.1 million, the district health insurance funds were unified into a centralized National&#13;
Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in 1991. Reimbursement of private health services by NHIF, as well as&#13;
the development of private health insurance, were also authorized at that time. Despite decentralized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financing in the past, the insurance system had uniformly offered universal coverage and a comprehensive&#13;
benefits package (preventive, curative, rehabilitative and chronic care), with no out-of-pocket costs. The&#13;
insurance system was, and is, financed predominantly through payroll contributions equaling 8.6 percent&#13;
of gross wages (payroll contributions as a whole--not including personal income tax--equal 31 percent of&#13;
gross wages).  Health insurance contributions from  the active labor force (wage earners and self-&#13;
employed) have provided around 60 percent of public revenues for health in recent years, with an&#13;
additional 23 percent from the Pension and Unemployment Funds to cover pensioners and registered&#13;
unemployed. Approximately 15 percent of revenues derive from user fees and other sources, and another&#13;
2 percent from the central budget, to cover MOH administrative costs and support national disease&#13;
prevention programs.  Public expenditures for health (not including cash transfers for sick pay) have&#13;
fluctuated at around 7-8 percent of GDP in the past four years, contracting roughly in proportion to the&#13;
economy. This contraction in spending--35 percent in real terms since 1990--has undermined the quality&#13;
and availability of basic health services, and given great urgency to the need for structural reform in the&#13;
financing and provision of health services.&#13;
B. Issues for Health Sector Reform&#13;
Preventable Burden of Disease&#13;
1.5            FYR Macedonia has succeeded in long-run improvement of health status, but continues&#13;
to suffer from a burden of disease which is largely preventable through cost-effective interventions at the&#13;
primary level. Two areas merit particular attention. Infant mortality (at 28 per 1,000 live births in 1991)&#13;
remains twice as high as the average for CEE countries, and three times the average for EME countries.&#13;
The long-term downward trend in infant mortality stagnated during the early transition, reflecting general&#13;
socioeconomic decline and the breakdown of basic health services-'. Approximately 40 percent of infant&#13;
deaths occur after the first month of life, largely as a result of infectious diseases. More than one quarter&#13;
of infant mortality is attributable to diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection--both preventable or&#13;
treatable through cost-effective primary care.  High-risk populations (generally poor, rural and/or&#13;
members of ethnic minorities) in FYR Macedonia have infant mortality rates of 40 or more, and a larger&#13;
share of infant deaths due to infectious disease and malnutrition. These high rates reflect differences in&#13;
maternal education, as well as more high-risk pregnancies and lower rates of prenatal care, attended births&#13;
and immunization coverage among these populations. More effective health promotion, prenatal care,&#13;
nutrition education and clinical services for maternal and child health are needed at the primary level to&#13;
further reduce infant mortality.&#13;
if Recent declines in the infant mortality rate result from a sudden and implausible 30 percent decline among certain high-risk&#13;
populations, which is likely to be attributable to declining participation in vital registration, rather than a significant improvement in&#13;
health status.&#13;

1.6           The second area of concern is the long-term buildup in premature death due to chronic&#13;
diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles. FYR Macedonia is beginning to see chronic disease death&#13;
rates usually seen in far wealthier, post-industrial societies. This is particularly true for cardio- and&#13;
cerebrovascular diseases, which are by far the leading causes of premature death in both men and women,&#13;
and are associated with risk factors such as high-fat diet, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol&#13;
consumption. Stress and social dislocation associated with the economic transition have undoubtedly&#13;
exacerbated this situation. Age-standardized death rates for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are 20-&#13;
40 percent higher than in much wealthier neighboring countries such as Greece and Italy, and are rising&#13;
toward the extreme levels seen in countries such as Hungary and Poland. Age-standardized rates for&#13;
other leading causes of death for men (lung cancer, liver disease) and women (breast cancer, stomach&#13;
cancer) are still below most EME countries, but rising steadily. Improvement in health status in FYR&#13;
Macedonia has ground to a halt during the transition as a result of trends in infant mortality and death&#13;
due to chronic diseases. If the country does not use health resources more cost-effectively for primary&#13;
and secondary prevention, it may soon face the worst of both worlds: infant mortality rates reminiscent&#13;
of developing countries and death due to chronic disease on par with wealthy post-industrial countries.&#13;

1.7               Adiustment to declining resources. Between 1991 and 1995, public revenues for health&#13;
declined by 40 percent in real terms, and have shown no sign of recovery. This decline is the result of&#13;
roughly proportional econornic contraction and a shrinking payroll tax base, as socially-owned enterprises&#13;
reduced wage payments and employment, emerging private enterprises evaded fiscal obligations and&#13;
statutory budget transfers were unfulfilled. The magnitude of the resource decline would have dramatic&#13;
consequences in any health system. In FYR Macedonia, ad hoc adjustment in spending resulted in the&#13;
virtual elimination of all capital expenditures and slashing of recurrent expenditures for personnel, drugs,&#13;
medical supplies and maintenance. This ad hoc adjustment was far from optimal, exacerbating long-&#13;
standing misallocation of resources. Personnel expenditures fell by 45 percent in real terms and drugs by&#13;
40 percent or more (partially compensated in some years through humanitarian aid), with similar spending&#13;
cuts across-the-board. Despite the cuts, arrears in the health sector have mounted to MKD 1.4 billion by&#13;
end-1995.&#13;

1.8             While critical operating and investment expenditures have been cut, no fundamental&#13;
restructuring of the public sector health network has occurred. As with other socially-owned enterprises,&#13;
health facilities have protected employment at the expense of real wages and working capital. To an even&#13;
greater extent than in other socially-owned enterprises, public health facilities have not been restructured&#13;
or liquidated, but rather have limped along in a largely inoperable state for lack of working capital. The&#13;
combination of poorly paid personnel and shortages of critical drugs and medical supplies has undermined&#13;
productivity and the quality of care--particularly at the periphery. Even core public health functions, such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

as childhood immunization, are at risk. In 1992, measles immunization coverage fell from over 90&#13;
percent to only around 60 percent--with measles epidemics following in 1993-94. Although humanitarian&#13;
assistance has temporarily shored up the immunization program in recent years, it is clear that the health&#13;
system needs to adjust to reduced public resources--but in ways which do not jeopardize the health of the&#13;
population.&#13;
1.9           Poor capacity utilization. With 2.4 physicians, 5.5 nursing staff and 5.4 beds per 1,000&#13;
population, staffing ratios and inpatient capacity in FYR Macedonia are on par with EME countries. This&#13;
is in contrast to many former socialist countries (e.g., Bulgaria, Russia) which have egregious excess&#13;
capacity. Nonetheless, FYR Macedonia cannot afford EME standards, and existing capacity in the system&#13;
is poorly organized and recent events have reduced demand for health services and shifted basic care up&#13;
the network to less cost-effective levels. Decentralization of health financing and management in the past&#13;
led to separate district networks of health facilities, with considerable fragmentation and duplication of&#13;
services. District secondary hospitals generally have catchment areas which are too small, and have&#13;
dramatically different ratios of physicians and nursing staff to occupied beds--implying widely varying&#13;
standards of care for similar acute care needs. Many specialized hospitals were established for treatment&#13;
of chronic diseases which today can be handled more efficiently in a general acute care or outpatient&#13;
setting.&#13;

loss of non-Macedonian patients in the system, as well as reduced national demand resulting fror, redu, ed&#13;
income, increased out-of-pocket costs and dissatisfaction with the lack of drugs, supplies and eqL6prn!_nt.&#13;
In 1991, the hospital referral system was abolished, allowing patients to seek care at any level of the&#13;
system. In search of higher quality care, patients have since moved up the hierarchy, flooding high-cost&#13;
hospital services with basic primary care needs. As a result, the average number of consultations per day&#13;
for a general medicine physician dropped from 20 in 1990 to 10 in 1993. Hospital occupancy rates are&#13;
low, with rates in secondary hospitals which serve populations of over 100,000, averaging only 59&#13;
percent in 1993. At the same time, at the Department of Medical Faculty in Skopje--the top of the health&#13;
network pyramid--patient admissions from outside Skopje increased by 40 percent between 1991 and&#13;
1993, and occupancy rates remain around 100 percent.&#13;
1.11         Occupancy and utilization rates are low for all but tertiary care facilities, despite average&#13;
lengths of stay (ALOS) which are high and rising. In contrast to a sharply declining international trend,&#13;
in FYR Macedonia ALOS has remained between 14 and 18 days for the past decade. For most of the&#13;
major diagnostic categories, ALOS in FYR Macedonia are two to four times longer than in the United&#13;
Kingdom (see examples below). Thus, the system has both excess capacity and poor utilization of&#13;
capacity--inefficiencies which existing health financing mechanisms fail to squeeze out.&#13;

1.12         Lack of fiscal sustainability. Like most socialist health systems, that of FYR Macedonia&#13;
had offered universal coverage for a comprehensive benefits package with no out-of-pocket costs. Since&#13;
1991, modest progress has been made in limiting public sector liability to finance health services. The&#13;
Health Protection Law adopted in 1991, and amended in 1993 and 1995, has begun to trim the benefits&#13;
package provided under compulsory national health insurance, and introduce copayments and user fees&#13;
for insured services. Services such as cosmetic surgery, thermal baths and certain prosthetic devices are&#13;
no longer reimbursed through the NHIF. The law also establishes the right to purchase supplemental&#13;
insurance for broader coverage, and the obligation to pay out-of-pocket for services not covered by&#13;
insurance. The 1993 amendment introduced copayments on insured services, ranging from 10 percent&#13;
for hospitalization to 50 percent for certain drugs and supplies. However, copayments are subject to&#13;
broad exemptions (children, the elderly, pregnant women, chronic disease patients) which undermine both&#13;
their revenue and incentive purposes. While some progress has been made to limit public sector liability,&#13;
it has obviously been insufficient to ensure fiscal sustainability, and has not involved a reallocation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

public resources toward the most cost-effective health interventions. A process is needed to identify&#13;
health priorities, based on the national burden of disease, and evaluate cost-effective strategies for&#13;
addressing these priorities. Coverage and reimbursement rates under the basic benefits package would&#13;
then need to be further limited, within the envelope of expected resources.&#13;
1.13          Lack of incentives for efficiency and quality of care. The financing mechanisms currently&#13;
in place offer no incentives to control costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. The NHIF relies&#13;
on input-based budgeting (staff, beds) to allocate funds to public sector facilities, without regard for&#13;
service volume, efficiency or quality. This budgeting system is a fallback method, following the&#13;
breakdown of an earlier "German-style" points system. A lack of cost accounting in public sector&#13;
facilities prevented the accurate valuation of points, rendering the system increasingly irrelevant. While&#13;
technically still in operation, the points system currently serves no allocative purpose. The existing&#13;
budgeting mechanism transfers no financial risk to providers, and, therefore, provides no incentives for&#13;
efficient behavior.  The lack of appropriate payment mechanisms also prevents the NHIF from&#13;
reimbursing private providers, despite its legal mandate to do so.  Thus, not only does the&#13;
underdevelopment of provider payment mechanisms fail to provide explicit incentives to public sector&#13;
facilities, but it also hinders privatization and private sector development which would offer competition&#13;
to the public sector.&#13;
1 .14         Inadequacy of managerial skills and tools. Despite past decentralization of the system,&#13;
many decisions (e.g., staffing ratios, wage levels) were centralized or made by the community council.&#13;
The managerial function--with managers taking risks and reaping the rewards of autonomous decision-&#13;
making--was nonexistent. Today, the MOH is committed to increasing managerial autonomy within an&#13;
appropriate regulatory framework, but facility directors tend to be physicians with no management&#13;
training. They also have little relevant information on which to base decisions, and few staff with the&#13;
necessary capacity to analyze information for decision-making. Health facilities lack a modem cost&#13;
accounting system, and there is little integration of medical and financial information needed to evaluate&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness. A systematic assessment of data needs has not been undertaken, nor a&#13;
strategy developed for the collection and use of data to improve health system management.&#13;
Poor Oualitv Services&#13;
1.15          Breakdown of primary health care. The quality and availability of PHC services have&#13;
deteriorated severely in recent years, particularly in rural areas. More than 40 percent of the population&#13;
resides in rural areas, and tends to be older and poorer than the general population. In the most isolated&#13;
border districts, the elderly constitute 10-19 percent of the population. The PHC budget is integrated in&#13;
the allocation to the district medical center--with rural PHC centers at the bottom of a budgetary hierarchy&#13;
which includes both the general hospital and outpatient polyclinics. Thus, the contraction in resources&#13;
has pinched hardest at the periphery. Separation of budgetary allocations and financial accounting for&#13;
hospital care, primary care and pharmacies is a badly-needed first step in clarifying financial priorities.&#13;
In a survey of 247 rural PHC centers, one quarter of those in need of a full-time physician were without&#13;
one. Virtually every center surveyed lacked some basic equipment for routine examination, minor surgical&#13;
intervention, sterilization and waste disposal. For example, around 30 percent lacked blood pressure&#13;
gauges and stethoscopes; 70 percent lacked infant scales and refrigerators; 90 percent lacked an otoscope&#13;
or a padded examination table. All were without health promotion materials. PHC staff are also too&#13;
narrowly trained, with doctors and nurses lacking a broad preventive and curative approach to family&#13;
medicine. Particularly damaging has been the lack of essential drugs at the primary level--a result of poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
procurement, distribution and reimbursement policies in the public sector.&#13;
1.16           Obstacles to affordable drugs. At an estimated three percent, the share of national income&#13;
spent on drugs in FYR Macedonia is extremely high by global standards. Approximately half of this&#13;
is financed by the public sector. For a small set of tracer drugs (all of which were common, essential&#13;
primary care drugs), it was found that market prices in public and private pharmacies in FYR Macedonia&#13;
were five to twenty times world market prices--a differential unjustified by distribution or other costs.&#13;
Such a situation is not surprising in the lucrative and imperfect pharmaceutical market, and calls for&#13;
effective government policy and regulation. Among the current problems: (i) a lengthy registration&#13;
process which requires cumbersome testing even for generic equivalents of registered drugs; (ii) a&#13;
prohibition on generic substitution by pharmacists; and (iii) pricing policies which   encourage&#13;
exaggeration of production and import costs and favor the marketing of higher-priced specialty drugs.&#13;
The public sector's purchasing and reimbursement practices are equally flawed. The public sector does&#13;
not limit its own purchasing or reimbursing to a list of essential drugs for primary and hospital care (the&#13;
existing "positive list" includes most drugs registered in the country). The public sector would also&#13;
benefit from bulk procurement of drugs and from a competitive bidding process, both of which would&#13;
lower unit costs. Finally, the NHIF places no ceiling on the amount of reimbursement for a particular&#13;
product (minus the copayment). Thus, the current policy framework provides no incentive to market&#13;
lower-cost drugs at competitive prices, and the existing financing mechanism permits this inefficiency to&#13;
flourish.&#13;
1.17           Inadeguate health promotion. Rising death rates from lifestyle-related chronic diseases&#13;
and persistent high rates of post-neonatal infant mortality speak to the need for more effective health&#13;
promotion. However, the modern concept of multi-sectoral and multi-media health promotion is largely&#13;
undeveloped. FYR Macedonia has some history of health education through a network of Public Health&#13;
Institutes whose dominant function is currently the collection of health statistics. Past health education&#13;
efforts were viewed with suspicion by the population, which saw them as a coercive, propagandistic arm&#13;
of the socialist state. Most health education efforts have not benefited from modern techniques of market&#13;
research and social marketing in order to select appropriate messages and media.  Finally, health&#13;
education and other disease prevention activities have functioned with minimal resources, with spending&#13;
amounting to less than two percent of total health expenditures in recent years.&#13;
1.18           Since the start of the transition, laudable efforts have been made to reorganize health&#13;
promotion activities according to health priorities, identify alternative funding and collaborate with&#13;
nongovernmental organizations (e.g., Red Cross) working at the community level. In 1993, government&#13;
activities were reorganized into eight national disease prevention programs, with funding for non-salary&#13;
expenditures from the central budget, in order to relieve pressure on the NHIF. However, budgetary&#13;
funding has fallen short of expectations, and NHIF resources have too often been channeled to short-term&#13;
curative needs by a medical community whose training is overwhelmingly oriented toward curative care.&#13;
Even the most basic disease prevention programs, such as maternal and child health care, are faltering,&#13;
and a medium term process of institutional development and resource reallocation is needed before health&#13;
promotion can fully play its role in reducing the burden of disease.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Government's Reform Strategy for Health&#13;
1.19           Reform of the health system since independence has included: (i) establishing a centralized&#13;
NHIF; (ii) introducing copayments, user fees and penalties for non-contribution; (iii) trimming the&#13;
guaranteed benefits package; (iv) increasing patient choice (although without retaining an appropriate&#13;
referral system); and (v) authorizing private health and insurance services, as well as NHIF&#13;
reimbursement of private services. The MOH and NHIF also enforced a radical--albeit insufficient--&#13;
downward adjustment in expenditures in response to fiscal crisis. Government quickly recognized,&#13;
however, the need for more fundamental reform and restructuring of the health system, in order to&#13;
reallocate resources toward cost-effective care and ensure fiscal sustainability of public spending. The&#13;
MOH took the decision to engage in a process of strategic planning--not only to define the health sector&#13;
reform program, but to identify the sequence of reforms most likely to ensure success. In mid-1994,&#13;
as part of the preparation process for the Health Sector Transition Project five technical working groups&#13;
were established consisting of MOH/NHIF personnel and representatives from other ministries, academia&#13;
and the medical community3'. Working together with World Bank and World Health Organization&#13;
support, these groups began to elaborate a strategy for medium-term health sector reform, including&#13;
appropriate sequencing of reform  measures.  They then identified the core policy agenda to be&#13;
implemented during the first phase of reform (1996-99), with support from an IDA project.&#13;
1.20           The overriding objective of Government's strategy for health system  reform  is to&#13;
overcome the current stagnation in health status by addressing high-priority health problems contributing&#13;
to infant, maternal and premature adult mortality. To achieve this, reforms will be aimed at: (i)&#13;
providing universal access to high-quality, basic preventive and curative health services and essential&#13;
drugs; (ii) promoting diversity and patient choice in the provision of services; (iii) establishing more&#13;
appropriate roles for the public and private sectors; (iv) ensuring the fiscal sustainability of public&#13;
spending for health; and, most importantly; (v) increasing the efficiency of resource allocation and use.&#13;
In the next three years, the core policy agenda will be implemented in the following areas: (i) Health&#13;
Finance and Management; (ii) Basic Health Services; and (iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply.4'&#13;
Health Finance and Management&#13;
1.21           The objective for health financing reform in the next three years is to ensure universal&#13;
access to basic health services while introducing appropriate financial incentives, ensuring fiscal&#13;
sustainability and increasing the efficiency of resource use. Central to this goal will be the introduction&#13;
of a process to identify health priorities and cost-effective interventions, leading to the redesign of the&#13;
basic benefits package in order to address key health needs within a sustainable resource envelope.&#13;
Technical studies have been launched during the project preparation phase to examine the national burden&#13;
of disease and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In redesigning the basic benefits package, supplemental&#13;
packages and premia will also be identified for those desiring broader coverage. Establishing an analytic&#13;
1/ The five working groups consisted of: (i) Health Finance; (ii) Hospital Care; (iii) Primary Health Care; (iv) Health Promotion; and&#13;
(v) Pharmaceutical Supply.&#13;
F For a more detailed discussion of the nature anid titning of specific policy measures, see the Government's Letter of Development Policy&#13;
for Health, included as Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
process within MOH for allocating resources will permit periodic adjustment of benefits packages and&#13;
premia in line with changing health priorities and resource availabilities. In conjunction with reform of&#13;
benefits, copayment, user fee and penalty policies will be reformed with an eye to eliminating excessive&#13;
exemptions, simplifying administration and minimizing barriers to essential health services.&#13;
1.22          Health financing reform  will also focus on introducing appropriate incentives for&#13;
efficiency and quality care. The current budgeting system will be superseded by provider payment&#13;
mechanisms which: (i) transfer some financial risk to health care providers; (ii) reward providers for their&#13;
level of effort and efficiency; (iii) remunerate public and private sector providers equally for equal&#13;
services; (iv) allow patient choice of physicians; and (v) establish predictable financial outflows from the&#13;
NHIF. Efforts will focus initially on the design, testing and nationwide implementation of a capitation&#13;
payment mechanism for primary health care. At the same time, pilot cost accounting data will be&#13;
generated which will permit the introduction of a case-mix based payment mechanism for hospital care.&#13;
Key to the success of the hospital payment mechanism, as well as to improved facilities management, will&#13;
be the design, testing and phased implementation of an integrated medical and financial information&#13;
system for public sector facilities, with appropriate linkage to the NHIF. This will involve a process of&#13;
identifying data needs, designing data collection mechanisms, developing an appropriate automation plan&#13;
and building analytic skills among future users of the information system. In addition, management&#13;
capacity will be enhanced througli training of MOH, NHIF and health facilities personnel. Intensive&#13;
training of trainers will ensure a core group for dissemination of management techniques and appropriate&#13;
feedback to line managers.&#13;
Basic Health Services&#13;
1.23          The objective of planned reforms in this area is to establish cost-effective, preventive and&#13;
curative primary health care as the backbone of the health system. Recently, Government took an&#13;
important step in this direction by reestablishing a mandatory referral system, in which individuals are&#13;
required to select a primary physician to serve as the first point of contact for routine care, and the&#13;
necessary referral for specialist outpatient and hospital care. In the next three years, Government intends&#13;
to redeploy public sector plysicianis to ensure adequate staffing of rural PHC centers, and invest in basic&#13;
equipment and in-service traininig for PHC staff to provide a broader, family medicine approach.&#13;
Streamlined PHC teams will be organized  in urban areas, and disease prevention programs will be&#13;
strengthened and modernized.&#13;
1.24          The complex task of restructuring and consolidating the public sector facilities network&#13;
will begin. Measures will be taken to reduce the number of public sector physicians, and limit the future&#13;
supply of doctors, dentists and pharmacists. The essential prerequisites to consolidation of the facilities&#13;
network--an appropriate referral system, adequate cost accounting and financial mechanisms in which&#13;
funds follow patients--will be put in place, followed by development and implementation of a&#13;
consolidation plan (to extend into the next phase of reform). An appropriate regulatory framework and&#13;
payment mechanisms will be established to promote voluntary and efficient development of private sector&#13;
health services.&#13;
Phannaceutical Policv and Supply&#13;
1.25          The goal of pharmaceutical reform in the 1996-99 period is to increase the availability&#13;
and affordability of essential drugs by creating a more competitive pharmaceutical market, establishing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
efficient public sector procedures and promoting rational prescribing practices. A draft Drug Bill has&#13;
been reviewed by IDA, and will be considered by Parliament in the near future in order to support the&#13;
reform agenda. It establishes a streamlined registration procedure for generic equivalents, authorizes&#13;
generic substitution by licensed pharmacists and eliminates restrictive pricing policies which favored high-&#13;
priced drugs. Supporting regulations are being developed, as well as essential drug lists which will serve&#13;
as the basis for public sector procurement and reimbursement. The public sector will also develop&#13;
competitive bidding procedures for bulk procurement of essential drugs for public sector facilities, in&#13;
order to lower unit costs. The NHIF will place a ceiling on reimbursement of essential drugs based on&#13;
a low-cost reference price, as is comnmonly done in many western countries.  A National Drug&#13;
Information Center will be established to serve as a clearinghouse for global information on&#13;
pharmaceuticals, as well as to promote rational prescribing practices among physicians and develop media&#13;
campaigns to educate the public about low cost alternatives to branded specialty drugs currently on the&#13;
market.&#13;

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Proiect Obiectives&#13;
2.1           The dual objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project (HSTP) are to: (i) improve&#13;
the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support an initial&#13;
phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice within the&#13;
health system. These broad objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms under three project&#13;
components. The specific objectives of these three components are as follows:&#13;
(a)    build capacity to analyze and apply information for policy-making and health system&#13;
management;&#13;
(b)    strengthen primary health care and support high-priority disease prevention and health&#13;
promotion programs; and&#13;
(c)    reduce the cost of essential drugs by creating a more competitive pharmaceutical market.&#13;
2.2           Project outcome indicators, as agreed with the Government, to measure the success in&#13;
achieving these objectives are defined in the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 2, para. 42).&#13;
B. Proiect Commonents&#13;
2.3           Each component of the HSTP (estimated total cost of US$19.4 million) is defined around&#13;
a core policy agenda. Project activities are designed to support implementation of this policy agenda,&#13;
while reversing recent declines in the quality of basic health care. Therefore, the description of each&#13;
component begins with a summary of the core policy agenda, which is outlined in detail in the&#13;
Government's Letter of Development Policy (LDP) for the health sector in Annex 1. Progress in&#13;
fulfilling the agenda set out in the LDP will be subject to joint annual review by the MOH and the IDA.&#13;
2.4           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will implement the policy&#13;
reform agenda detailed in the Letter of Development Policy, and will review jointly with IDA progress&#13;
in carrying out the agenda on an annual basis.&#13;
Component I: Health Finance and Manayement (estimated base cost US$3.8 million)&#13;
2.5           Core policy agenda. The MOH and the Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) have diversified&#13;
revenues and reduced public spending for health care in line with reductions in national income and fiscal&#13;
resources. This has been achieved through dramatic reductions in real wages, drugs, medical supplies,&#13;
maintenance and investment--but has not been sufficient to avoid the accumulation of arrears in the sector.&#13;
This ad hoc fiscal adjustment must now give way to a planned adjustment focusing on reallocation of&#13;
resources toward more cost-effective health care, appropriate limitations on public sector reimbursement&#13;
and introduction of financial incentives for efficient and effective care in both the public and private&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.6           The MOH will carry out a comprehensive review of sources and uses of funds in the&#13;
health sector, including existing and potential revenue sources and expenditures for primary care,&#13;
ambulatory specialists, diagnostic and laboratory services and hospital care. This will provide a broad&#13;
basis for carrying out reform of health financing mechanisms. In this first phase of reform, the core&#13;
policy agenda supported under this component will be:&#13;
(a)    definition of a fiscally-sustainable benefits package (on the basis of burden of disease&#13;
priorities and cost-effectiveness of treatment) to be covered by mandatory national health&#13;
insurance, as well as supplemental premiums and packages;&#13;
(b)    revision of copayment/user fee policies and penalties for non-contribution to health&#13;
insurance;&#13;
(c)    adoption of a capitation payment mechanism for public and private sector primary health&#13;
care; and&#13;
(d)    adoption of an integrated medical and financial information system for the public sector&#13;
health network, as a prerequisite to defining a new payment mechanism for hospital care.&#13;
The nature and timing of these reforms is described in detail in the LDP (Annex 1, paras. 5-9).&#13;
2.7           Activities. The Project will provide technical support for preparation and implementation&#13;
of the health financing reforms summarized above, as a continuation of technical work begun during&#13;
project preparation. Technical support would include a resident Health Financing Advisor responsible&#13;
for coordinating short-term teams of local and foreign consultants to carry out policy studies related to&#13;
each reform. The Project will also provide support for public information/advocacy campaigns using&#13;
social marketing techniques, to enhance understanding and acceptance of health sector reforms among&#13;
policy-makers, interest groups and the general public.&#13;
2.8           The capability of NHIF personnel to analyze and implement policy options would be&#13;
strengthened through fellowships and in-country training workshops in health economics, principles of&#13;
insurance, health system planning and public advocacy techniques, as well as a study tour of comparative&#13;
health financing systems. Capacity building for the NHIF office would include technical and financial&#13;
support to develop trainers and training seminars for staff of district HIF offices. The Project will also&#13;
support a study tour, initial training seminars and development of a continuing education program in&#13;
facilities management for hospital administrators and medical directors.&#13;
2.9           To provide the tools for effective management, and allow for the future introduction of&#13;
a case-mix based hospital reimbursement system, the Project will support development and testing of an&#13;
integrated medical and financial management information system for public sector health facilities. The&#13;
Project will implement the first phase of a medium-term automation plan for this integrated information&#13;
system. The management information system will be tested in two pilot districts, each of which will&#13;
receive an automation package--tailored to the size of the population served and existing hardware--for&#13;
the participating Medical Centers (general hospital and polyclinic), two primary health care centers,&#13;
district Institutes of Public Health (responsible for national health statistics), and district HIF offices.&#13;
Information technology will also be provided to the NHIF and NIPH offices. The necessary electronic&#13;
linkage for data transfer and processing within the NHIF network will be established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
2.10           Prior to negotiations, Government selected two pilot districts according to agreed upon&#13;
criteria for testing of: (i) the medical and financial management information system; (ii) the health&#13;
statistics information system; and (iii) the capitation payment mechanism for primary care.&#13;
Component 11: Basic Health Services (estimated base cost US$7.0 million)&#13;
2.11           Core Policy Agenda. Government's decision in 1991 to centralize district insurance funds&#13;
into a unified health insurance fund has helped to maintain universal access to care, while allowing&#13;
maximum  risk-sharing and alleviation of regional inequities in the quality of basic care.  In 1992,&#13;
national disease prevention programs were reorganized, and funding for materials and supplies was shifted&#13;
from the NHIF to the central budget, as an attempt--with mixed success--to ensure adequate support for&#13;
high-priority prevention and health promotion activities. Greater success was achieved in securing&#13;
humanitarian assistance to supply vaccines and essential drugs for health services during the transition.&#13;
However, this source has dwindled as donors await reform aimed at reorienting public sector resources&#13;
toward primary care. Under the Project, this reform will focus on providing cost-effective primary care&#13;
as the backbone of the health system, through:&#13;
(a)    reinstatement of a hospital referral system through mandatory annual enrollment with a&#13;
primary care physician;&#13;
(b)    assignment of full-time physicians to selected rural primary health centers;&#13;
(c)    adoption of a simplified staffing structure for primary health care teams in urban areas,&#13;
and of a guaranteed package of primary health services which provides cost-effective care&#13;
(based on successful models from other countries);&#13;
(d)    net reduction of at least 200 public sector physicians through attrition (retirement,&#13;
voluntary privatization) over the three year period;&#13;
(e)    reduction of enrollments in medical faculties for physicians, dentists and pharmacists; and&#13;
(f)    provision of adequate central budget funding for selected disease prevention activities.&#13;
The nature and timing of these reforms are described in detail in the LDP (Annex 1, paras. 10-16).&#13;
2.12           Activities.  The MOH  working group on basic health services undertook a needs&#13;
assessment and established a standard equipment list for rural PHC centers. Under the Project, basic&#13;
equipment kits corresponding to these needs will be distributed to all rural PHC centers in the country&#13;
(the list of basic equipment proposed is found in the PIP). In the first year of the Project, kits will be&#13;
distributed to 150 centers with one or more full-time physicians. The following year, kits will be&#13;
distributed to 50 additional PHC centers to which a full-time physician will be assigned. A more limited&#13;
equipment kit, appropriate for 50 centers without full-time physicians, will also be distributed in the&#13;
second year of the Project. In addition to equipping rural PHC centers, the Project will provide technical&#13;
and financial support for workshops and study tours to help MOH and professional associations develop&#13;
their own permanent programs for: (i) continuing education of primary care personnel; (ii) broadening&#13;
the skills of primary care physicians; and (iii) identifying and enforcing quality assurance standards for&#13;
primary care. Short-term fellowships will also be provided to develop capacity within the MOH for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 17 -&#13;
planning and implementation of primary care strategies.&#13;
2.13          The Project will provide material support for five national disease prevention and health&#13;
promotion programs for: (i) immunization, (ii) maternal and child health; (iii) tuberculosis prevention;&#13;
(iv) AIDS prevention; and (v) blood donation and supply. These programs were selected on the basis&#13;
of their potential impact in reducing the national burden of disease and on the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
proposed interventions. With respect to the immunization program, the Project will contribute to&#13;
maintaining coverage rates at 95 percent or more. While UNICEF will provide parallel financing for&#13;
most vaccines needed to combat childhood diseases and control epidemics, the Project will supply&#13;
necessary hepatitis B vaccines. In the area of maternal and child health, the Project will provide material&#13;
support for reproductive health services, as well as drugs and equipment for prevention and treatment of&#13;
disease in neonates and infants. Support will also be given for restructuring and expanding the existing&#13;
cervical cancer screening program. For prevention of tuberculosis, the Project will improve screening&#13;
capacity through provision of spare parts for x-ray equipment, photographic film and replacement of two&#13;
decrepit mobile clinics with one new mobile van. Under the AIDS prevention program, test kits will be&#13;
provided for HIV screening. To increase blood supply, the Project will build on the early success of&#13;
public campaigns aiming to restore donation levels to 60,000 units per annum, by providing support for&#13;
promotional materials in several local languages. Finally, the Project will provide equipment and&#13;
materials to strengthen laboratory diagnostics for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.&#13;
2.14          Prior to negotiations, Government gained parliamentary approval for amendments to the&#13;
Health Protection Law reinstating the hospital referral system through annual enrollment with primary&#13;
care physicians.&#13;
Component III: Phannaceutical Policy and Supply (estimated base cost US$5.7 million)&#13;
2.15          Core Policy Agenda. The share of national income spent on drugs in FYR Macedonia is&#13;
among the highest in the world. Prescribing practices favor overconsumption, while procurement, pricing&#13;
and reimbursement policies favor high-priced specialty drugs and limit competition. Private sector activity&#13;
has grown rapidly within a largely unregulated environment. An estimated half of national consumption&#13;
is financed by the public sector through the NHIF (US$28 million in 1994). Past public spending patterns&#13;
for drugs have been difficult to maintain as NHIF revenues have declined by 40 percent in real terms&#13;
since 1991. Public spending was supplemented with humanitarian assistance in the 1992-94 period, but&#13;
this source has dwindled rapidly. The time has come for Government to work within its real resource&#13;
constraints, and focus on more efficient procurement, pricing, reimbursement and prescribing in order&#13;
to ensure an affordable supply of essential drugs. With technical support from the World Health&#13;
Organization, the MOH has begun revision of drug legislation, as well as organizing seminars on rational&#13;
drug use and national drug policy.  The Project will build on these past efforts, emphasizing&#13;
implementation of key reforms in the following areas:&#13;
(a)    streamlining of registration procedures for equivalent products and authorization of&#13;
generic substitution;&#13;
(b)    adoption of pricing policies which favor lower-cost drugs;&#13;
(c)    adoption of appropriate essential drug lists for primary care and hospital care;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(d)    introduction of competitive bidding for public sector drug procurement;&#13;
(e)    establishment of a reference price reimbursement system for essential drugs; and&#13;
(f)    promotion of rational prescribing practices.&#13;
The nature and timing of these reforms are described in detail in the LDP (Annex II, paras. 17-24).&#13;
2.16           Activities. The Project will provide technical support for further revision of the Drug&#13;
Bill and accompanying regulations with respect to registration, pricing and generic substitution, as well&#13;
as establishment of essential drug lists for primary and hospital care. It will build local capacity for&#13;
competitive procurement and for implementation of a reference price reimbursement system for NHIF&#13;
which would place ceilings on allowable payments according to drug type. Capacity-building would&#13;
occur through external internships in international procurement offices, coupled with follow-up technical&#13;
support and studies to establish reference prices and carry out initial international tenders for drugs.&#13;
Essential drugs and supplies from the agreed lists would be procured in the second year of the Project,&#13;
to ease NHIF resource constraints and provide practical experience in international competitive bidding&#13;
for pharmaceutical products.&#13;
2.17          Under the Project, equipment, short-term fellowships, in-country training and technical&#13;
support will be provided to upgrade the present drug quality assurance system. Supply of advanced drug&#13;
testing equipment for quality control labs will enable government to match the increasing technical&#13;
sophistication of the domestic industry and foreign suppliers. It will facilitate bioequivalence testing to&#13;
permit rapid introduction of generic equivalents. The Project will also support the establishment of a&#13;
drug information center, as well as a srnall center for adverse drug reaction monitoring. Parallel funding&#13;
from EU/PHARE and WHO will contribute to improvements in the drug inspection system, as well as&#13;
provide institutional support and training for the drug information and adverse drug reaction centers.&#13;
Through the drug information center, the Project will support information campaigns directed at&#13;
prescribers, dispensers and the public to promote more rational use of drugs.&#13;
2.18           Prior to negotiations, Government submitted to IDA a satisfactory draft Drug Bill,&#13;
reflecting the Government's drug policy reform strategy.&#13;
2.19           As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit Government will sign a contract&#13;
with a procurement agency to ensure procurement and distribution of pharmaceutical products, medical&#13;
equipment and supplies under the Project in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
(January 1995). As a condition of disbursement of the pharmaceutical component a Drug Law,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, regulating the registration, trade and distribution of drugs in the territory of the&#13;
Borrower, will be enacted, and all provisions for implementation of this legislation completed.&#13;
International Proiect Unit (estimated base cost US$0.9 million)&#13;
2.20           The Project will support establishment of an IPU in the Ministry of Health. The IPU will&#13;
be responsible for coordination, management and monitoring of the Health Sector Transition Project, as&#13;
well as coordination of other donor-funded activities in the health sector. The IPU will be headed by a&#13;
Director, with support from a core staff funded under the Project. This core staff will consist of a&#13;
Procurement Officer, Disbursernent Officer/Accountant, and Office Administrator/Interpreter employed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
full-time for the Health Sector Transition Project.&#13;
2.21          IPU responsibilities will include: (i) project administration and coordination (including&#13;
liaison with the World Bank and agencies/institutions involved in implementation of the Project);&#13;
(ii) follow-up and reporting; and (iii) maintaining project records and accounts. It is also expected that&#13;
the IPU will provide a focal point for coordination of health sector reform activities, and assist in&#13;
dissemination of information about the reform program to policy-makers, interest groups and the general&#13;
public. To facilitate the work of the IPU, the Project will make available funding for short-term foreign&#13;
and local consultancy services, in project-related areas such as procurement and project management, as&#13;
well as policy-related areas such as health economics and private sector development  With additional&#13;
staff, the IPU could also serve to coordinate implementation of other donor-funded activities (e.g.,&#13;
EU/PHARE, UNICEF) to ensure that all externally-funded activities support the MOH's medium-term&#13;
strategy for health sector reform.&#13;
2.22           Prior to negotiations, Government established the International Project Unit within MOH&#13;
and appointed a full-time director and procurement officer with authorization to carry out the project&#13;
activities.&#13;
2.23           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that the MOH  will maintain&#13;
continuous staffing of the IPU to include a Director and staff devoted full-time to the Health Sector&#13;
Transition Project consisting of a procurement officer, disbursement officer/accountant and office&#13;
administrator/interpreter. It was further agreed that decisions would be taken jointly during project&#13;
implementation for recruitment of additional IPU staff, if necessary to entsure effective implementation&#13;
of the proposed Project.&#13;
C. Project Justification&#13;
Proiect Alternatives&#13;
2.24           As noted above, the dual objectives of World Bank intervention in the health sector in&#13;
FYR Macedonia are to: (i) improve the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic health&#13;
services; and (ii) promote reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice&#13;
in the health system. To achieve these objectives, alternative project designs were considered, and&#13;
ultimately rejected for the following reasons-'.&#13;
2.25           Improving health status. The known determinants of health status are--in descending&#13;
order of importance--(i) economic status; (ii) lifestyles/behaviors; (iii) quality of the health system; and&#13;
(iv) environmental risks. Socioeconomic conditions in FYR Macedonia have declined dramatically in the&#13;
past five years, exerting a negative impact on health status. Despite strong efforts by Government and&#13;
the World Bank to encourage stabilization, structural adjustment and capital investment, economic&#13;
recovery is expected to be slow--even if ideal policy and investment decisions are taken. Therefore,&#13;
improvement in health status must be through countervailing action on other determinants: lifestyles, the&#13;
51 See Annex 3, Selection among Alternative Project Designs for a more detailed discussion of options considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
health system and the environment. World Bank efforts are already underway to identify and alleviate&#13;
environmental risks, leaving to this Project the task of reducing the burden of disease through behavioral&#13;
change and improved health services. Rapid assessment of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality&#13;
in FYR Macedonia indicates that no one vertical program would be more cost-effective than broad-based&#13;
primary care in reducing the overall burden of disease--hence support for comprehensive preventive and&#13;
curative primary care. Thought was given to investing solely in health promotion programs (which are&#13;
cost-effective in changing lifestyles in the long run) but ultimately the Project seeks a broader reallocation&#13;
of public resources toward health promotion--not just an IDA investment--which necessitates restructuring&#13;
and investment in the health network as a whole. Furthermore, it was not a politically acceptable option.&#13;
2.26           Promoting reforms to enhance cost effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice.&#13;
The Government has adopted one alternative to increasing the fiscal sustainability of the health system:&#13;
across-the-board budget cuts which have undermined the cost-effectiveness, quality and availability of&#13;
care. Another alternative--increasing the payroll tax burden--would have a negative impact on the cost&#13;
of labor, and is to be avoided. FYR Macedonia spends a relatively high share of national income (around&#13;
7 percent) on health, pointing to a need for more effective expenditures, not higher revenues. At this&#13;
point, the only alternative to achieving the goals of fiscal sustainability, cost-effectiveness and patient&#13;
choice simultaneously is to reallocate public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions,&#13;
set limits to public sector financial liabilities and create incentives for efficient and competitive behavior&#13;
among health care providers. The Project has been designed to maximize the likelihood of success in&#13;
carrying out these difficult reforms. Each component was designed around a core policy agenda, with&#13;
investments to support implementation of reforms according to a carefully designed sequence.&#13;
Financial Impact&#13;
2.27           Public sector. The project investments generate minimal incremental recurrent costs,&#13;
equal to less than one percent of recurrent health expenditures. Incremental costs associated with the&#13;
Project are dwarfed by the fiscal savings resulting from reforms supported by the Project. Among the&#13;
reform measures which will generate fiscal savings are:&#13;
(a)    definition of a basic benefits package for health insurance within the limits of expected&#13;
payroll contributions (workers, pensioners, registered unemployed);&#13;
(b)    shifting of care to less expensive levels, through an appropriate referral system;&#13;
(c)    reduction of public sector health personnel, and reduction of public sector support for&#13;
medical training;&#13;
(d)    introduction of financial incentives to prevent unnecessary medical procedures and&#13;
excessive lengths of stay;                      I&#13;
(e)    establishment of  lists of essential drugs for procurement and reimbursement, and&#13;
adoption of competitive bidding procedures and reference price reimbursement ceilings;&#13;
(f)    elimination of broad exemptions on copayments and user fees; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(g)    consolidation of the public sector facilities network (to continue into the next phase of&#13;
reform).&#13;
The extent of fiscal savings will depend on future decisions about the scope of the benefits package, the&#13;
essential drug lists and the reduction in staffing and capacity. Initially, the objective will be to reduce&#13;
public spending for health in line with expected revenues, preventing further accumulation of arrears and&#13;
eliminating the existing stock of arrears. Whether there is a further reduction in public resources for&#13;
health--rather than an expansion of cost-effective interventions--is a political decision. One cannot argue&#13;
on economic grounds that FYR Macedonia is spending "too much" on health, but rather that the country&#13;
is not getting enough for its money. The Project will substantially increase the cost-effectiveness of&#13;
public spending for health, providing the opportunity to reduce the overall resource envelope to a&#13;
sustainable level.&#13;
2.28           Private sector. The reform agenda for pharmaceuticals will lower the cost of drugs (the&#13;
greatest source of private health expenditures) for everyone by creating a more competitive market and&#13;
revising pricing policies. Strengthening of primary care in rural areas will lower the out-of-pocket costs&#13;
of care for rural populations by reducing travel and waiting costs, as well as eliminating hospital&#13;
copayments and fees for routine care. Elimination of broad exemptions on copayments will raise out-of-&#13;
pocket costs for patients in specific groups, but care will be taken to reinforce the progressive nature of&#13;
copayments (higher rates for less essential services) and to define a means-tested basis for guaranteeing&#13;
access to basic services for the poor.&#13;
Rationale for Public Sector Involvement&#13;
2.29           Imperfections and failures in the health care and pharmaceutical markets (externalities,&#13;
uncertainty, asymmetry of information, market power), as well as societal equity considerations, justify&#13;
a strong--albeit changed--role for the public sector in the financing, regulation and, in some cases,&#13;
provision of health services.  Public sector financing of health services allows broad risk-pooling&#13;
(especially in a country as small as FYR Macedonia) to overcome the inefficiency of financial uncertainty.&#13;
It also allows redistribution to achieve equity objectives. Public sector health financing also serves as a&#13;
regulatory tool, through payment mechanisms which curb supplier-induced demand for unnecessary&#13;
services and other inefficient behavior by public and private sector providers. For these reasons, the&#13;
Project supports reform of the existing public sector financing mechanism in FYR Macedonia.&#13;
2.30           Many personal health services can be provided efficiently by the private sector once an&#13;
appropriate incentive structure and regulatory framework are in place. Reforms supported by the Project&#13;
aim to eliminate obstacles and create an environment conducive to privatization and private sector&#13;
development of health services. However, international experience demonstrates that the private market&#13;
will not offer sufficient incentive to provide socially desirable services in poorer, more isolated areas.&#13;
For this reason, most governments offer special incentives and/or direct public sector provision of basic&#13;
health services in poor, rural areas. Likewise, this Project will strengthen public sector provision of&#13;
primary health care only in targeted rural villages, where public sector intervention is justified.&#13;
2.31           The pharmaceutical market is notoriously noncompetitive, particularly in small markets,&#13;
where monopoly or oligopoly is common. The public sector generally relies on both regulation (e.g.&#13;
registration procedures, pricing and substitution policies) and direct provision of essential drugs to create&#13;
competition for the private sector. Unfortunately, the public sector itself is often very inefficient in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
providing drugs, so that government failure may equal or exceed market failure. Thus, the Project&#13;
supports not only reforms aimed at creating a more competitive private market, but also measures to&#13;
increase the efficiency of Government procurement and distribution.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.32           Public sector investment in the health sector is justified on grounds that much of the&#13;
economic benefit of improved health status accrues to society at large, rather than providing a financial&#13;
return to the investor. In the absence of low-cost, domestic capital for public sector investment in human&#13;
development, IDA resources are a good choice for FYR Macedonia. The country has also turned to the&#13;
World Bank for assistance in this area because the Bank can provide high-quality technical advice on&#13;
health sector reform from a broad, international perspective. IDA involvement in health sector reform&#13;
in FYR Macedonia through this Project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
discussed by the Board of Directors during presentation of the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment&#13;
Credit (FESAC; Credit 2721, Report No. P-6539) on April 19, 1995. Key objectives of the CAS include&#13;
maintenance of a fiscally sustainable social safety net during the transition period and restoration of long-&#13;
run economic growth. Broad access to basic health services is an essential element of the social safety&#13;
net, while improvement in health status will increase the productivity of human capital in the long run.&#13;
Health financing reforms also contribute to controlling fiscal deficits which undermine economic growth.&#13;
Hence, a health sector project has been included in the lending program, even under a low-case scenario.&#13;
2.33           Sector work was carried out at an early stage to identify priorities for health sector reform&#13;
and investment.t' Consultant reports produced in collaboration with the technical working groups during&#13;
project preparation addressed the following topics: (i) health finance; (ii) hospital care; (iii) primary health&#13;
care; and iv) health promotion." FYR Macedonia also participated in the Social Challenges of Transition&#13;
Exercise, which has provided a comparative view of health systems in nine other CEE countries, greatly&#13;
facilitating strategy formulation. The resulting health sector reform strategy is now serving not only as&#13;
the foundation for the Health Sector Transition Project, but also as an input in the definition of the&#13;
country's Policy Framework Paper and the proposed Social Sector Adjustment Loan (FY97).&#13;
Cost-Effectiveness of the Project&#13;
2.34           Project components were carefully selected not only for the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
proposed investments, but also for the impact of associated reforms on the cost-effectiveness of public&#13;
resource use in the health sector as a whole. Rigorous cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis of each&#13;
component was not carried out during project preparation for two reasons: (i) a broader collaborative&#13;
process of assessing health priorities and evaluating cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions is an&#13;
integral part of the Project itself; and (ii) rigorous analysis was deemed unnecessary to provide an&#13;
adequate economic justification for the proposed investments. Justification of each component is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
2.35           Component 1: Health Finance and Management. This component provides economic and&#13;
FYR Macedonia: Health Services in Transition, September 1993.&#13;
Consultants' reports available in the project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
fiscal benefits through its impact on the allocation of public resources in the health sector. During project&#13;
preparation, a process was initiated to assess health priorities by carrying out a national burden of disease&#13;
analysis, to be followed by use of cost-effectiveness analysis as a tool to define a more appropriate&#13;
benefits package for national health insurance. This, more than any other reform, will channel public&#13;
resources toward more cost-effective health interventions.  The process will continue under this&#13;
component, with the objective of not simply revising the initial benefits package, but of building&#13;
permanent capacity in the MOH to assess health priorities and use cost-effectiveness analysis to make&#13;
choices among alternative treatments. The component also supports the introduction of financial incentives&#13;
for efficient behavior by health care providers, and strengthens the management skills and information&#13;
tools needed to ensure cost-effective use of resources.&#13;
2.36          Component 11: Basic Health Services. The component invests in primary health care as&#13;
the backbone of the health system, strengthening, in particular, disease prevention and health promotion&#13;
activities. The project preparation team assessed the leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality&#13;
in FYR Macedonia--providing a rough indication of the burden of disease. With continued high levels&#13;
of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and maternal mortality due to high-risk pregnancies and&#13;
abortions, as well as rapidly rising premature mortality due to chronic diseases associated with unhealthy&#13;
lifestyles, it was clear that reduction in the burden of disease could be achieved most cost-effectively&#13;
through preventive and curative care at the primary level. The body of international evidence on the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of primary health care in addressing multiple elements of the burden of disease made the&#13;
calculation of potential disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) gained in FYR Macedonia unnecessary.&#13;
Cost-effectiveness of prevention efforts such as childhood immunization, family planning and prenatal&#13;
care--all supported under this component--are well established internationally, and no factors are present&#13;
which would significantly alter in FYR Macedonia the high ratio of benefits to costs.&#13;
2.37          Support for combatting infectious diseases which lead to disability and death in young&#13;
adults--AIDS and tuberculosis--also has a high DALY payoff, particularly given FYR Macedonia's&#13;
elevated incidence of tuberculosis (among the highest in the CEE). A proposal to intervene in the area&#13;
of smoking prevention would have been highly cost-effective, but was rejected by MOH as too&#13;
controversial at this time. The project preparation team (both IDA and client members) believes that&#13;
investment in less controversial disease prevention programs under this first Project, and demonstration&#13;
of success in applying modern social marketing techniques, will build a solid relationship upon which to&#13;
broach the more controversial smoking/tobacco issue under future projects.&#13;
2.38          Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supplv. The benefit of this component lies&#13;
in its economy-wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as in the provision of essential drugs,&#13;
vaccines and medical consumables for effective primary care. The second most important determinant&#13;
of quality in primary health care--behind well-trained staff--is the availability of essential drugs. In recent&#13;
years, the Government has relied on humanitarian aid to supplement its own dwindling resources for&#13;
drugs, but these flows have largely dried up as a result of both regional events and resistance by donors&#13;
to continuing the supply in the absence of more meaningful reform of the pharmaceutical sector. The&#13;
Project will provide funding for essential drugs and vaccines--as an input into strengthening primary&#13;
health care--but will link investments to the implementation of a difficult reform agenda.&#13;
2.39          At an estimated three percent of national income, the rate of spending on pharmaceuticals&#13;
in FYR Macedonia is among the highest in the world. More than half of the estimated US$60 million&#13;
per annum in drug spending is funded by the public sector. Market prices of five to twenty times world&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
market levels indicate a noncompetitive market unrestrained by appropriate public sector regulation or&#13;
intervention. The reform agenda aims at improving the affordability and availability of essential drugs&#13;
by creating a more competitive policy environment and increasing the efficiency of public sector drug&#13;
procurement and reimbursement. If one makes a conservative estimate that implementation of the reform&#13;
agenda will lower prices by one-third, then the economy would save US$60 million during the three-year&#13;
project implementation period alone. Fiscal savings would total around US$30 million, against an initial&#13;
investment cost of US$6.4 million. These large economic and fiscal benefits would continue beyond the&#13;
life of the Project. This high benefit-cost ratio amply justifies the component--although success in&#13;
implementing the reforms may be politically difficult (see Risks, below).&#13;
Impact on Poverty&#13;
2.40          By reallocating public resources towards provision of high-quality basic health services,&#13;
the Project will benefit the poor, who cannot currently afford to pay out-of-pocket for private sector&#13;
services. By creating insurance payment mechanisms which reimburse public and private sector providers&#13;
equally for equal services, the Project gives patients--particularly poor patients--choice, and with choice,&#13;
the power to influence the quality of care provided. Investments in strengthening primary health care in&#13;
rural areas and in disease prevention (equal to 44 percent of the IDA credit) will also benefit the poor,&#13;
who live disproportionately in rural areas. Thus, the proportion of beneficiaries is significantly larger&#13;
than their proportion in the overall population, qualifying the Project for inclusion in IDA's Program of&#13;
Targeted Interventions. Replacing broad copayment exemptions for specific patient groups with a means-&#13;
tested basis for exempting the poor should also result in a better-targeted system of ensuring access to&#13;
basic health services.&#13;
IDnact on the Environment&#13;
2.41          The Project is expected to have a marginally beneficial impact on the environment. By&#13;
providing appropriate equipment for medical waste disposal at the primary care level, the Project will&#13;
have a small positive environmental impact. Otherwise, the Project will not have a direct impact on the&#13;
environment, and has been assigned to Environmental Category C.&#13;
Proeect Risks&#13;
2.42          Sustainabilitv of Political Commitment. The risk which dominates all others vis-a-vis the&#13;
success of the Project is political. It is the risk that the country cannot muster the political will necessary&#13;
to implement fundamental health sector reform, particularly with respect to limiting insurance benefits,&#13;
squeezing economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating the public sector facilities&#13;
network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing politically and economically&#13;
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. One of every seven parliamentarians is a doctor&#13;
which heightens the need for careful marketing of the reform strategy to lawmakers. Much will depend&#13;
on the leadership of the Minister of Health, and his ability to articulate to the public and the parliament&#13;
the objectives and strategies underlying the reform program.&#13;
2.43          To overcome this risk, the following strategy has been pursued. First, technical working&#13;
groups with representatives of relevant ministries, academia and the medical community were formed at&#13;
an early stage. This ensured broader participation of stakeholders in both strategy formulation and project&#13;
preparation. Second, the project preparation team encouraged early interaction with the media, resulting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
in MOH press conferences at every stage of project design. Third, early efforts were also made to&#13;
market the emerging reform strategy to key political and economic policymakers. Success of reform will&#13;
depend on support from the highest levels of government, not only the commitment of the MOH.&#13;
Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in the Project to support a vigorous&#13;
communications strategy, with a full-time consultant to the International Project Unit to assist the MOH&#13;
in designing and implementing effective public information campaigns. The Project will support continual&#13;
opinion research, as well as development of appropriate messages and media approaches for various&#13;
stakeholders, including the general public, the medical community and lawmakers.&#13;
2.44          Institutional Capacity. An additional project risk lies in the weak institutional capacity&#13;
of the MOH, and its limited experience in implementation of large, internationally funded projects. The&#13;
MOH has a direct staff of only 25, mostly with medical--as opposed to managerial--training. The MOH&#13;
is adjusting to its new role in a market-oriented health system, focused more on policymaking and&#13;
regulation than on direct provision of services. There is a tendency to want to exert heavy-handed,&#13;
centralized control rather than to rely on establishment of an appropriate policy environment, regulatory&#13;
framework and incentive structure. This is neither desirable in a mixed public/private health system, nor&#13;
feasible given manpower and financial constraints. Thus, institutional constraints to effective&#13;
implementation are both physical and psychological.&#13;
2.45          Experience in implementing internationally-funded projects has been limited to the&#13;
distribution of humanitarian aid in recent years. To alleviate this and other weaknesses in institutional&#13;
capacity, the Project invests heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH and NHIF through&#13;
training, study tours and technical assistance. The Project also supplements MOH implementation&#13;
capacity through provision of long-term local management consultants to support the newly-created&#13;
International Project Unit. The IPU will coordinate implementation of this Project, as well as other&#13;
donor-funded investments. Although the reform agenda is substantive, the Project itself was designed&#13;
for easy implementation: simple investments organized into a small number of procurement packages.&#13;
Medical equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines accounting for more than 60 percent of the IDA credit&#13;
will be procured by a local agent with sophisticated infrastructure and a strong track record on&#13;
international purchasing and nationwide distribution.&#13;
Monitorin2 and Evaluation&#13;
2.46          A detailed description of project monitoring and evaluation--including summary tables for&#13;
inputs, outputs and outcomes--is provided in Chapter IV of the PIP (Annex 2). Project monitoring will&#13;
involve assessment of project inputs and outputs. Monitoring the use of project resources will be done&#13;
by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure category (PIP, Table 9). Monitoring&#13;
outputs under the Project is more complex, involving both implementation of project activities and&#13;
implementation of the policy reform agenda. For the former, key project activities have been identified&#13;
as output indicators (PIP, Table 10). For the latter, progress in implementing reforms will be jointly&#13;
assessed by Government and IDA on an annual basis. A timetable of expected progress, with carefully-&#13;
defined progress benchmarks, has been summarized in the policy matrix attached to the Government's&#13;
Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1). For project evaluation, a limited set of outcome indicators has&#13;
been selected on the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to project activities, ease of&#13;
data collection and parsimony (PIP, Table 11). However, it is recognized that changes in some of these&#13;
indicators cannot be causally linked directly to project activities, since the Project is only one of multiple&#13;
factors impacting health status and services during the short (three-year) implementation period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
However, annual monitoring of these indicators will provide evidence of overall trends in the health status&#13;
of the population, the effectiveness of health services and the efficiency of public spending for health--all&#13;
of which the Project seeks to influence positively.&#13;
Overall Coherence and Completeness of the Policy Framework&#13;
2.47          The Health Sector Transition Project has been designed around a core policy agenda for&#13;
health sector reform. This core policy agenda, as summarized in the Letter of Development Policy, is&#13;
a coherent and sound basis for IDA involvement in the health sector. While it does not solve all&#13;
problems in the health sector, this initial phase of reform carefully identifies those measures which will&#13;
have the greatest impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending for health. A careful&#13;
sequencing of reforms within the three-year project implementation period was elaborated by&#13;
Government. Implementation of these reforms--with support from the Project--will lead to the reallocation&#13;
of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, introduce incentives for efficiency&#13;
and quality, build managerial capacity, strengthen basic health services in poorer, rural areas, introduce&#13;
modern techniques of health promotion and vastly increase the affordability and availability of essential&#13;
drugs. These outcomes are central to the short- and long-run improvement of health status in FYR&#13;
Macedonia, the objective against which IDA involvement will be evaluated.&#13;

111. PROJECT COSTS. FINANCING, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.1           This chapter provides a summary of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) prepared in&#13;
collaboration with the Borrower, and reviewed and found satisfactory by IDA. The PIP, attached to this&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report as Annex 2, includes detailed information on:  (i) project implementation&#13;
arrangements and responsibilities; (ii) project cost, financing, procurement and disbursement&#13;
arrangements; (iii) monitoring and evaluation; (iv) supervision and reporting requirements; (v) initial&#13;
project implementation schedules; and (vi) several agreed terms of reference and equipment lists.&#13;
A. Project Cost&#13;
3.2           Total project cost is estimated at US$19.4 million, or MKD 737 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies.  Total  base cost is estimated at US$17.4 million.  Physical and price&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US$1.4 million and US$0.6 million, respectively. The foreign exchange&#13;
component is estimated at US$14.5 million, or 75 percent of total cost. All imported goods and services&#13;
destined for health institutions and related purposes--including those financed under the Project--are&#13;
exempt from taxation and customs duties.&#13;
3.3           Project costs include financing for medical and laboratory equipment and supplies,&#13;
essential drugs and vaccines, office equipment, computers, furniture, local and external technical&#13;
assistance and training, minor facilities' rehabilitation, and incremental operating costs (including&#13;
equipment maintenance, supplies and incremental staff salaries). Cost estimates by project component&#13;
are shown in Table 1 of the PIP, and by expenditure category in Table 2.&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
3.4           The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent) will finance&#13;
87 percent of the estimated total project cost, including 100 percent of the total foreign exchange cost&#13;
(US$14.5 million) and 48 percent of estimated local costs (about US$2.4 million of a total US$5.0&#13;
million). The Government will finance the remaining estimated US$2.5 million in local costs. Table 3&#13;
of the PIP shows the financing plan for the Project, and Table 4 the project cost breakdown by&#13;
component and financier.&#13;
3.5           Project cost estimates include US$0.3 million (1.5 percent of total project cost) in&#13;
incremental operating costs attributable to the Project during the three-year period. These costs comprise&#13;
equipment operation and maintenance, minor operating expenses and supplies, and incremental staff&#13;
salaries. On an annual basis, these incremental operating costs are estimated at MKD 5.0 million, equal&#13;
to less than 1 percent of the recurrent health budget. These costs will be more than compensated by fiscal&#13;
savings from a number of measures being undertaken by the MOH, inter alia, limiting insurance benefits,&#13;
introducing competitive procurement for pharmaceuticals and reducing public funding for medical&#13;
training.&#13;
3.6           Project start-up is being facilitated through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) Advance&#13;
of US$223,500 (P983-0-MK). The PPF is being used to establish and equip the International Project Unit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(IPU), hire and train key project unit staff, and hire local experts needed for a series of technical studies&#13;
to be carried out with assistance from a team of external consultants.&#13;
C. Project Mana2ement and Implementation&#13;
3.7           The IPU, established in the MOH, is headed by a Director, and supported by several full-&#13;
time staff (long-term local consultants under contract with the MOH for the duration of the Project),&#13;
including: a procurement officer (already in place), disbursement officer/accountant, and office&#13;
administrator/interpreter .&#13;
3.8           The IPU is be responsible for coordination, management and monitoring of the Health&#13;
Sector Transition Project. More specifically, the Unit's responsibilities include: (i) project administration&#13;
and coordination (including liaison with IDA and agencies and institutions involved in implementation&#13;
of the Project); (ii) procurement coordination and follow-up; (iii) maintaining project records and&#13;
accounts; and (iv) monitoring, evaluation, and progress reporting. It is also expected that the IPU will&#13;
provide a focal point for coordination of health sector reform activities, and assist in dissemination of&#13;
information about the reform program to policymakers, interest groups and the general public. Short-&#13;
term local and external consultancy services in areas such as procurement and project management, as&#13;
well as in policy-related areas such as health economics and market regulation, are foreseen to assist the&#13;
IPU in fulfilling its role. With the addition of more full-time staff, the IPU will also serve as&#13;
coordinating agency for other donor-funded activities (e.g., WHO, UNICEF), ensuring consistency with&#13;
the MOH's medium-term strategy for sector reform.&#13;
3.9           Overall responsibility for implementation of each of the components is as follows:&#13;
(i) Health Finance and Management--lead agency, the National Health Insurance Fund; (ii) Basic Health&#13;
Services--lead agency, the Office of the Assistant Minister for Primary and Preventive Health Care; and&#13;
(iii) Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply--lead agency, the Department of Pharmaceuticals in the MOH.&#13;
A thorough discussion of implementation responsibilities is found in Sections B and C of the PIP.&#13;
D. Proiect Supervision&#13;
3.10          The Project is expected to require a total of about 33 weeks of supervision per year&#13;
during the three-year implementation period, including 15 weeks for routine supervision of project&#13;
implementation, and 18 weeks of supervision and continued dialogue and advice on implementation of&#13;
the core policy agenda. Estimated annual supervision requirements are presented in Table 8 of the PIP.&#13;
E. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.11          Items to be procured have been grouped into a small number of packages (about eight)&#13;
to encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk procurement. The Bank's standard bidding documents&#13;
will be used for procurement under the Project. Paragraphs 25-34 of the PIP found in Annex 2 provide&#13;
details regarding procurement arrangements envisaged under the Project, and the standard procurement&#13;
information is presented in Table 5. All procurement financed under the Credit will be carried out in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
accordance with IDA Guidelines. Details concerning procurement packages, including the nature of the&#13;
package, estimated value and implementation timetable, are presented in Table 6 of the PIP.&#13;
F. Disbursements&#13;
3.12          The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years, which is&#13;
considerably shorter than the All-Regions Profile for health and population projects of 9.5 and 8.5 years,&#13;
respectively. In addition, the country profile is speculative since this Project is only the second operation&#13;
in the human resources sectors in the FYR Macedonia, the first having become effective less than one&#13;
year ago. The shorter implementation period for the Health Sector Transition Project reflects the nature&#13;
of the Project as a source of bridge financing during the initial phase of the transition and in support of&#13;
the first phase of the Government's health reform program. Investments under the Project, and the&#13;
packaging of procurement, have been kept simple to accommodate the shorter timeframe. Implementation&#13;
and related disbursements will be facilitated by having defined equipment lists and agreed terms of&#13;
reference prior to project implementation (see Chapters V &amp; VI of the PIP). Moreover, the use of an&#13;
experienced procurement agency to procure and distribute, on behalf of the MOH, medical equipment,&#13;
supplies and pharmaceuticals procured under the Project (estimated value about US$7 million or 40% of&#13;
the IDA credit) will also simplify implementation. The closing date will be March 31, 2000. Estimated&#13;
disbursements of the Credit by year are shown in Table 7 of the PIP.&#13;
3.13          Implerr.entation will be facilitated by the establishment of a Special Account, opened by&#13;
the Government in a bank and maintained under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The account&#13;
will be denominated in US dollars, and will have an authorized allocation of US$1.0 million. Further&#13;
details regarding the Special Account are outlined in para. 36 of the PIP.&#13;
G. Proiect Audits and Reportin2&#13;
3.14          The IPU will be responsible for coordinating annual project audits and for fulfilling&#13;
reporting requirements. With respect to project accounts, including the Special Account, they will be&#13;
audited in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed&#13;
by the World Bank (March 1982), and will be provided by the Borrower within six months of the end&#13;
of each fiscal yea!. In addition, the IPU will be responsible for preparing semi-annual progress reports,&#13;
which will include:  a sunmmary of progress under each component, proposals for rescheduling of&#13;
activities where necessary, actual disbursements and projections for the subsequent six-month reporting&#13;
period, as well as a thorough analysis of progress in implementation of the health sector reform program&#13;
as outlined in the Letter of Development Policy. Further information concerning auditing and progress&#13;
reporting under the Project is provided in paras. 37-38 of the PIP.&#13;
3.15          During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will prepare and furnish to&#13;
the Association by January 31, 1998 a report on progress achieved in carrying out the Project up to&#13;
that time and proposing measures to ensure achievement of objectives during the remaining project&#13;
period. It was further agreed that the Association and the Borrower will jointly review this report by&#13;
March 31, 1998 and, on the basis of conclusions from that review, agree on steps to be taken to ensure&#13;
efficient project completion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
H. Status of Preparation&#13;
3.16          During the initial stages of preparation, the Borrower established five technical working&#13;
groups to develop project proposals for each component. That structure--with minor modification--has&#13;
remained in place and has been a principal contributor to the thorough preparation process. Through&#13;
changes in political leadership at MOH, the working groups provided continuity in preparation of both&#13;
the reform strategy and the specific project proposals, leading to an internalization of the Project by MOH&#13;
personnel and participants from the medical community and associated institutions. The close&#13;
collaboration of the working groups with IDA staff and with WHO led to progress in the formulation of&#13;
the Government's medium-term strategy, which has served as the basis for the core policy agenda&#13;
supported under this Project. This agenda has been broadly discussed with a view to achieving the&#13;
consensus necessary for its implementation. The Project Implementation Plan, setting out detailed&#13;
responsibilities and arrangements for carrying out project activities, has been prepared and agreed.&#13;
Lastly, the IPU has been established and key staff appointed to ensure a smooth start-up of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1           The economic benefits of the Project include better quality basic health services and more&#13;
cost-effective use of public resources for health--both of which will counteract the negative impact of&#13;
recent economic and fiscal contraction on the health of the population. Benefits by component are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
4.2           Component I: Health Finance and Management. This component provides economic and&#13;
fiscal benefits through its impact on the allocation of public resources for health.  It will result in a&#13;
reallocation of public resources toward more cost-effective health interventions, as well as limitation of&#13;
health expenditures to fiscally sustainable levels. The component implements a basic benefits package&#13;
for health insurance which is based on cost-effective treatment of national health priorities, and is tailored&#13;
to available resources. It also develops permanent capacity in the MOH to use the tools of burden of&#13;
disease and cost-effectiveness analysis to adjust benefits as health priorities and resource constraints&#13;
evolve. The component will also put in place incentives for efficiency and quality of care, through the&#13;
establishment of new provider payment mechanisms, and will build managerial skills and provide&#13;
management tools--particularly the integrated medical and financial information system--which will result&#13;
in more effective resource management in the health sector&#13;
4.3           Component II: Basic Health Services. Cost-effective reduction in the burden of disease,&#13;
through improved preventive and curative primary care, is the major economic benefit of this component.&#13;
With continued high levels of infant mortality due to infectious diseases and maternal mortality due to&#13;
high-risk pregnancies and abortions, as well as rapidly rising premature mortality rates due to chronic&#13;
diseases associated with unhealthy lifestyles, it is clear that preventive and curative primary care is the&#13;
most cost-effective way to reduce multiple elements of the burden of disease. The component will result&#13;
in adequately staffed and equipped primary health care centers in rural areas, offering a broader approach&#13;
to family medicine with greater emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion. It will also begin&#13;
the process of consolidating staffing and physical capacity in the public sector network in order to use&#13;
resources more efficiently. The component will result in more effective reduction of the leading causes&#13;
of infant, child, maternal and other premature adult mortality through support for prevention programs&#13;
in the areas of childhood immunization, maternal and child health, tuberculosis and AIDs prevention and&#13;
blood supply. Within these prevention programs, a demonstration of the effectiveness of modern, social&#13;
marketing techniques in changing lifestyles to improve health will pave the way for greater investment&#13;
in health promotion under future projects.&#13;
4.4           Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply. The benefits of this component lie&#13;
in its economy-wide impact on the price of essential drugs, as well as the direct provision of drugs,&#13;
vaccines and medical consumables for more effective primary care. The second most important&#13;
determinant of quality in primary care--behind well-trained staff--is the availability of essential drugs.&#13;
The component will supply drugs and other consumables, linked to implementation of pharmaceutical&#13;
sector reform aimed at increasing the affordability and availability of essential drugs. Legislative reform&#13;
will result in streamlined registration procedures allowing easier market entry for lower-cost generic&#13;
equivalents. It will also allow licensed pharmacists to substitute lower-cost generic equivalents for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
prescription specialty drugs. Reform of pricing policies will alter financial incentives to encourage&#13;
marketing of lower-cost drugs. Adoption of essential drug lists for public sector procurement and&#13;
reimbursement, as well as the introduction of competitive bidding for bulk procurement and reference&#13;
price ceilings for public sector reimbursement will lower unit costs for drugs in the public sector, and&#13;
channel public resources toward the most cost-effective drugs. Overall, the economic and fiscal gains&#13;
of this component dwarf the economic costs, with fiscal savings in the three-year project implementation&#13;
period conservatively estimated at ten times the investment cost. These large economic and fiscal benefits&#13;
will continue beyond the life of the Project.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
4.5            The Project faces two key risks--one political, the other institutional. The political risk&#13;
is dominant in determining the success of the Project. It is the risk that the country cannot muster the&#13;
political will necessary to implement fundamental health sector reform, particularly with respect to&#13;
limiting insurance benefits, squeezing economic rents out of the pharmaceutical market and consolidating&#13;
the public sector facilities network. Government has only the health care consumer on its side, facing&#13;
powerful medical and pharmaceutical interest groups. One of every seven parliamentarians is a doctor--&#13;
heightening the need for careful marketing of the reform strategy to lawmakers. To reduce this risk, the&#13;
following strategy has been pursued. First, technical working groups with representatives of relevant&#13;
ministries, academia and the medical comrnunity were formed at an early stage to ensure broad&#13;
participation in both strategy formulation and project preparation. Second, the project preparation team&#13;
encouraged early interaction with the media, resulting in MOH press conferences at every stage of project&#13;
design. Third, early efforts were also made to market the emerging reform strategy to key political and&#13;
economic policymakers. Finally, and most importantly, resources have been included in the Project to&#13;
support a vigorous communications strategy, including a full-time consultant to the International Project&#13;
Unit assisting the MOH in designing and implementing effective public information campaigns. The&#13;
Project will support continual opinion research, as well as development of appropriate messages and&#13;
media approaches for various stakeholders, including the general public, the medical community and&#13;
lawmakers.&#13;
4.6           A secondary risk lies in the weak institutional capacity of the MOH, and its limited&#13;
experience in implementation of internationally-funded projects. The MOH has a direct staff of only 25,&#13;
mostly with medical--as opposed to managerial--training. Some are having difficulty adjusting to the new&#13;
role of the MOH in a more market-oriented health sector. Indeed, institutional constraints to effective&#13;
project implementation are both physical and psychological. To alleviate this risk, the Project will invest&#13;
heavily in building managerial capacity within the MOH and NHIF through training, study tours and&#13;
technical assistance. The Project also supplements MOH's implementation capacity through provision&#13;
of local management consultants, working full-time to support the newly-created International Project&#13;
Unit. The IPU will coordinate implementation of this Project, as well as other donor-funded investments&#13;
to ensure coherence with the medium term strategy for health sector reform. Although the reform agenda&#13;
supported by the Project is substantive, project activities were designed for easy implementation: simple&#13;
investments organized into a small number of procurement packages. Medical equipment, supplies, drugs&#13;
and vaccines accounting for more than 40 percent of the IDA credit will be procured by a local agent&#13;
with sophisticated infrastructure and a strong track record of international purchasing and nationwide&#13;
distribution.&#13;

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1           Prior to negotiations, Government:&#13;
(a)    selected two pilot districts according to agreed upon criteria for testing of: (i) the&#13;
medical and financial management information system; (ii) the health statistics&#13;
information system; and (iii) the capitation payment mechanism for primary care (para.&#13;
2. 10);&#13;
(b)    gained Parliamentary approval for amendments to the Health Protection Law reinstating&#13;
the hospital referral system through annual enrollment with primary care physicians&#13;
(para. 2.14);&#13;
(c)    submitted to IDA a satisfactory draft Drug Bill, reflecting the Government's drug policy&#13;
reform strategy (para. 2.18); and&#13;
(d)    established an International Project Unit within MOH and appointed a full-time director&#13;
and procurement officer with authorization to carry out the project activities (para. 2.22).&#13;
5.2           During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will:&#13;
(a)    implement the policy reform agenda detailed in the Letter of Development Policy, and&#13;
will review jointly with IDA progress in carrying out the agenda on an annual basis&#13;
(para. 2.4);&#13;
(b)    maintain continuous staffing of the IPU, to include a Director and staff devoted full-time&#13;
to the Health Sector Transition Project consisting of a procurement officer, disbursement&#13;
officer/accountant and office administrator/interpreter (2.23); and&#13;
(c)    prepare and furnish to the Association, by January 31, 1998, a report on progress&#13;
achieved in carrying out the Project up to that time and proposing measures to ensure&#13;
achievement of objectives during the remaining project period. It was further agreed that&#13;
the Association and the Borrower will jointly review this report by March 31, 1998 and,&#13;
on the basis of conclusions from that review, agree on steps to be taken to ensure&#13;
efficient project completion (para. 3.15).&#13;
5.3           As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit, Government will:&#13;
(a)    sign a contract with a procurement agency to ensure procurement and distribution of&#13;
pharmaceutical products, medical equipment and supplies under the Project in accordance&#13;
with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995) (para. 2.19).&#13;
5.4           As a condition of disbursement of the Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply component:&#13;
(a)    a Drug Law, satisfactory to IDA, regulating the registration, trade and distribution of&#13;
drugs in the territory of the Borrower, will be enacted, and all provisions for the&#13;
implementation of this legislation completed (para. 2.19).&#13;
Recommendation&#13;
5.4           Subject to the above, the proposed Project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit&#13;
of SDR 11.8 million (US$16.9 million equivalent) to the Government of FYR Macedonia.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR TRANSITION PROJECT&#13;
Skopje, May 15 1996&#13;
Mr. James Wolfensohn&#13;
President&#13;
International Development Association&#13;
1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:&#13;
The Republic of Macedonia inherited from the former Yugoslav federation a publicly-funded and&#13;
publicly-provided health system, organized on the basis of "self-managed communities of interest"&#13;
with decentralized health insurance funds and local networks of health facilities. The system had a&#13;
number of strengths, including universal health coverage, broad access, minimal financial risk for&#13;
individuals, well-trained health personnel and strong epidemiological control. As a result, the&#13;
health system contributed to the long-term improvement in the health of the population, with life&#13;
expectancy rising from 61 years in 1960 to 72 years in 1990--far exceeding the average for&#13;
countries of similar income level, and even surpassing the average for much wealthier countries in&#13;
Central and Eastem Europe. Nonetheless, the health system at independence suffered from long-&#13;
standing weaknesses and inefficiencies. In particular, the system offered no financial incentives to&#13;
health personnel and patients to increase efficiencv, control costs and improve the quality of care.&#13;
Facilities lacked clear ownership as well as managenral autonomy and decision-making skills.&#13;
Excessive decentralization had led to duplication and fragmentation of services, coupled xvith&#13;
regional inequities in the quality of care. The system relied too heavily on hospital-based care, and&#13;
overemphasized curative treatment at the expense of more effective disease prevention programs.&#13;
These problems were underscored during the early years of independence, when severe economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
contraction led to a dramatic decline in public resources for health, which fell by nearly 40 percent&#13;
in real termns between 1991 and 1993. This decline gave greater urgency to the need for reforms to&#13;
increase the cost-effectiveness of health spending.&#13;
Health System Reform Since Independence&#13;
Following independence in 1991, we revised the existing Health Protection Law to address&#13;
certain structural problems in the health system. In particular, we established a single, centralized&#13;
Health Insurance Fund (HIF) to maximize risk-sharing and alleviate regional inequities in the&#13;
quality of care. Socially-owned facilities were transformned into a single network of public sector&#13;
facilities reporting to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Private sector health insurance and health&#13;
services were authorized, along with HIF reimbursement of private services (reimbursement of&#13;
private services has been limited, in practice). Patients were granted free choice of physicians,&#13;
although regulations were not put in place to maintain an appropriate hospital referral system.&#13;
This has since exacerbated the overreliance on hospital-based care. Further revision in 1993&#13;
introduced financial participation by patients in the costs of ambulatory care, hospital care, drugs,&#13;
medical supplies and prosthetic devices (copayments ranging from 10 to 50 percent of the reference&#13;
price).  A  first effort was also made to exclude some health services--largely cosmetic&#13;
interventions--from HIF reimbursement, and to require the uninsured to pay for health services out-&#13;
of-pocket.&#13;
We were obliged to make a rapid and difficult fiscal adjustment in the health system.&#13;
Public sector spending for health declined in line kith real reductions in national income, although&#13;
this was insufficient to prevent the accumulation of arrears. This ad hoc expenditure adjustment&#13;
was not optimal, relying on across-the-board reductions in recurrent spending (for drugs. vaccines,&#13;
medical supplies, maintenance, utilities and staff remuneration) rather than restructuring of the&#13;
public system and reallocation of resources toward more cost-effective types of care. As a result,&#13;
the quality and broad availability of basic health services has been seriously compromised in recent&#13;
years.  We are commuitted to more fundamental restructuring and resource reallocation, but&#13;
recognize the need for strategic planning and technical expertise to define an appropriately-&#13;
sequenced reform program. With financial and technical support from the proposed IDA-funded&#13;
Health Sector Transition Project, ve have already embarked on the process of defimng and&#13;
implementing a medium-term  strategy for health system  reform.  Technical working groups&#13;
established by our MOH to prepare the project have elaborated a number of background papers&#13;
setting out the broad objectives of our health system reform, and outlining a sequence of steps to&#13;
achieve them. Using these documents as a basis, the technical working groups have identified a&#13;
limited number of core policy measures to be implemented during the first phase of reform, with&#13;
support from the proposed IDA-funded health project.&#13;
Strate2'v for Health System Reform. 1996-99&#13;
Our overriding objective is to overcome the current stagnation in health status associated&#13;
w%ith the early phase of the transition, by addressing high-prioritv health problems contributing to&#13;
infant, maternal and premature adult mortality. To achieve this, we will focus on reform of the&#13;
health system aimed at: i) maintaining universal access to basic preventive and curative health&#13;
services and essential drugs; ii) promoting diversitv and patient choice in provision of health&#13;
services; iii) redefining the role of the public sector in health policy and service delivery. and&#13;
establishing a more appropriate public/private mix of health services; iv) improving the fiscal&#13;
sustainabilrx of public spending for health; and v) increasing the efficiency of resource allocation&#13;

and use.  An initial phase of reforms will be implemented over the next three years. This core&#13;
policy agenda will focus particularly on: i) health financing and reimbursement; ii) organization&#13;
and management of health service; and iv) pharmaceutical policies and supply.&#13;
Health Financin2 and Mana2ement&#13;
Our objectives for health financing over the next three years are to ensure universal access&#13;
to basic health services while introducing appropriate financial incentives and ensuring fiscal&#13;
sustainability of the Health Insurance Fund. On November 7, 1995, we submitted to Parliament a&#13;
further revision of the Health Protection Law which specifies that out-of-pocket payment is&#13;
required for all health services not explicitly covered by compulsory health insurance, and for&#13;
specialist outpatient and hospital care to which the patient was not referred by his/her primary&#13;
physician. This is part of our effort to reestablish a referral system in order to discourage&#13;
excessive use of hospitals (see para. 11)   for discussion of the referral system), as well as a&#13;
precursor to further limiting compulsory health insurance coverage. In the next three years, we&#13;
will focus our efforts on the followNing core policy agenda: i) definition of a basic package of health&#13;
services for compulsory health insurance coverage; ii) revision of copayment and user fee policies,&#13;
and penalties for non-contribution to insurance, iii) adoption of a capitation payment mechanism&#13;
for public and private sector primary health care; and iv) adoption of an integrated medical and&#13;
financial information svstem (as a prerequisite to defining a case-mix payment mechanism for&#13;
hospital care). PHRD grant resources made availabl by the Japanese Government for project&#13;
preparation will permit us to begin the necessary technical studies shortly. The recommendations&#13;
of these studies will be reviewed by our Government's Technical Committee on Health Finance,&#13;
which will then propose necessary legislative and regulatory changes.&#13;
Basic benefits for comDulsorv health insurance coverage. A technical team of foreign&#13;
and local experts will assess the burden of disease in Macedonia in order to quantitatively evaluate&#13;
health priorities.  They Nvill then use existing information on the cost-effectiveness of various&#13;
treatments along with estimated costs of actual treatment in our country to recommend ways to&#13;
limit basic health insurance coverage in terms of types of services and level and/or lifetime value of&#13;
reimbursements. Their objective N1ill be to define a basic package which is financially sustainable&#13;
Within the expected resources from statutory health insurance contributions. At the same time,&#13;
they w'ill define one or more supplemental premiums and packages for those who desire broader&#13;
coverage. We anticipate that the technical proposal for basic and supplemental packages will be&#13;
ready by December 31, 1996, with Government presentation of the recommended packages to&#13;
Parliament by June 30, 1997. Following Parliamentary discussion and adoption, we expect the&#13;
resulting basic package to be under implementation through the HIF by December 31, 1997.  Its&#13;
presentation to Parliament will- coincide v.ith presentation of proposed revisions to the Health&#13;
Protection Law. These revisions will increase the flexibilitv of the law to permit: i) periodic&#13;
adjustment of the basic package of health services, ii) revision of copayment and user fee policies;&#13;
and iii) introduction of new provider payment mechanisms.&#13;
Couavment and user fee policies. Existing proposals to revise copavment and user fee&#13;
policies will be studied in order to simplify admninistration, eliminate excessive exemptions and&#13;
grant Government flexibility to periodically adjust rates through an appropriate institutional&#13;
mechanism.  Recommendations will be review ed by the Technical Committee on Health Finance&#13;
and then incorporated in revisions to the Health Protection LaN, to be presented to Parliament for a&#13;
first reading by June 30,1997. The revised policy is expected to be implemented by December 31,&#13;
1997.&#13;

Capitation pavment mechanism for vrimary health care. In the next few years we wlill&#13;
proceed with the design, testing and nationwide implementation of a capitation payment system for&#13;
primary health care. Currently, salary and material payments to public sector facilities are made&#13;
regardless of service utilization, while payments to the emerging private sector are erratic and&#13;
prone to abuse. Adoption of a capitation system corresponds to our needs to find a payment&#13;
mechanism which: i) emphasizes primary care as the backbone of the health system; ii) rewards&#13;
health care providers for their level of effort and their efficiency; iii) remunerates public and&#13;
private sector providers equally for equal services, iv) allows patient choice of primary physician;&#13;
and v) establishes a predictable financial outflow  from the H1F.  Technical study Will begin&#13;
immediatel. to define the basic package of primarv health services to be included within the&#13;
capitated payment (as part of the larger process of defining basic insurance coverage) and&#13;
estimating the average per capita cost of providing these services. Design and implementation of&#13;
the capitation payment system will be linked to our reinstatement of a referral svstem   and&#13;
restructuring of public sector primary health care teams (para. I 1). Legislative revisions needed to&#13;
allow  introduction of the capitation system  will be included in the proposal  presented to&#13;
Parliament by June 30,1997. Pilot testing of the capitation system in two zones will also begin bv&#13;
June 30 1997 and extend for a full year. Two pilot sites were selected prior to negotiation of the&#13;
proposed health project. By June 30 1998, regulations regarding the capitation system will be&#13;
modified as necessary, with nationwide implementation completed by June 30, 1999.&#13;
Inteerated medical and financial information system for public sector health facilities.&#13;
We intend to design, test and implement for all public sector health facilities an integrated medical&#13;
and financial information system which assists managers in strategic decision-making and permits&#13;
development of a case-mix based payment system for hospital care. The proposed design of the&#13;
integrated management information system (MIS) will be presented to the Technical Committee on&#13;
Health Finance (Information Systems subcommittee) by June 30, 1997. One-year pilot activities&#13;
in two zones, including two medical centers (general hospital and polyclinic) and four associated&#13;
primary care centers, will be underway by June 30, 1997 in order to test and refine the MIS By'&#13;
June 30 1998, a technical review of the pilot phase will be completed, and a plan defined for&#13;
introduction and eventual automation of the MIS nationwide. Data from the pilot phase vAill be&#13;
used to develop a case-mix based pavment system  for hospitals. to steer resources toward&#13;
productive facilities and create incentives for efficiency and cost containment. This will replace the&#13;
current system of allocating resources largely on the basis of staffing. The technical proposal for a&#13;
new  hospital payment system  will be completed by December 31, 1998, with nationlide&#13;
implementation undervay by June 30, 1999.   In addition to the facilities-based NIS, data&#13;
collection for national health statistics (e.g. morbidity, mortality) will be strengthened under the&#13;
proposed Health Sector Transition Project.&#13;
Organization of Health Services&#13;
In an aggregate sense, staffing levels and service capacity in our health system are on par&#13;
with averages in Westem Europe. However, services are not organized for optimal efficiency, and&#13;
the system represents a heavy fiscal burden given our national income level. Duplication and&#13;
fragmentation of services are common, due to the highly decentralized approach of the past. Manv&#13;
facilities are fully staffed, but underutilized. Shortages in drugs and supplies at the periphery&#13;
coupled with a breakdown of the referral system have scnt patients streaming into tertiary care&#13;
hospitals to meet even their basic primary health care nceds. We recognize the need to rationalize&#13;
our public sector health system, shifting the bulk of care to wNhere treatment is most cost effective--&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 5 of 15&#13;
the primary level--and consolidating or liquidating redundant services wvhen they are clearly&#13;
identified. However, rationalization will only be possible with: i) development of accounting and&#13;
payment mechanisms which explicitly link resources to service delivery; ii) reinstatement of an&#13;
appropriate referral system to shift patients to the primary level; and, most importantly, iii)&#13;
provision of high-quality care at the primary level.&#13;
Development of new accounting and payment mechanisms will be supported by the&#13;
proposed health project, and reform measures are described in paras. 9-10 above. Amendments to&#13;
the Health Protection Lawv reinstating a referral system were adopted by Parliament on November&#13;
7, 1995. Under the amendment, individuals select a primary physician (with the option to change&#13;
each year) who is the first point of contact for routine care, and provide the required referral for&#13;
specialist outpatient and inpatient services (except emergency care). Each individual's health&#13;
identity card will include the name of his/her primary physician.  This policy will halt the&#13;
indiscriminate use of specialist and hospital services, particularlv for primary health needs.&#13;
However, implementation of this policy will be successful only if high-quality services are&#13;
available at the primary level.&#13;
Both policy reform and investmnents are needed to improve the quality and ensure the&#13;
financial sustainabilitv of our primary health care system, particularly in rural areas.  We have&#13;
asked the World Bank to support key investments in quality care, including basic reequipping of&#13;
rural primary health centers, development of continuing education programs for health personnel at&#13;
the primary level and establishment of quality assurance standards and monitoring. A critical&#13;
element will also be an affordable supply of essential drugs at the primary level, as described in&#13;
paras. 17-23 below. The core policy agenda will address staffing pattems for primary care as well&#13;
as the overall supply of health professionals in the system, as a main determinant of longer-run&#13;
financial sustainability.&#13;
Staffing of rural orimarv health centers. 250 rural primary health centers xwill receive&#13;
equipment packages under the proposed project. Of these, 150 are currentlv staffed with a full-&#13;
time phvsician, in addition to one or more nurses. These centers will be reequipped in 1996, and&#13;
remain staffed with a full-time physician throughout the 1996-99 period. Of the remaining 100&#13;
primarv health centers which are not staffed with a full-time physician, 50 have been selected by&#13;
the technical working group as requiring full-time physician services, based on the size of the&#13;
population served and proximity to other health services. We will redeplov existing public sector&#13;
staff in order to assign  full-time physicians to these 50 centers by June 30 1997.  This&#13;
redeployment will be a prerequisite to reequipping the remaining 100 rural primary health centers.&#13;
Creation of primary health care teams in urban areas. In urban areas, provision of&#13;
primarv care is excessively fragmented among a number of physicians and health professionals.&#13;
They tend to be overly-specialized according to patient age-groups, leading to inflexibility and&#13;
inefficiency in staff deployment. Pediatricians unnecessarilv limit themselves to treating either&#13;
ages 0-7 or 7-19, dentists focus on either of these age groups or adult care. Workplace physicians&#13;
duplicate basic primarv care services offered in free-standing clinics. We intend to simplify this&#13;
staffing structure, bs realigning public sector health personnel in urban areas into primarv health&#13;
care tcams. A primary liealth care team would consist of a core group of physicians--a general&#13;
practitioner, a pediatrician, an obstetrician-gynecologist and a dentist--plus associated nursing&#13;
persornel. The general practitioner would coordinate the primarv health care team, and serve as&#13;
primary physician for the purposes of referral to specialist services and hospital care. Other&#13;
specialist personnel would continue to offer consulting services by referral, but would fall outside&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the core primary health care team. A detailed plan for reorganization of primary care personnel&#13;
into primary health care teams will be prepared by December 31 1996, with implementation&#13;
completed by June 30, 1997.&#13;
Supply of health  professionals.  In order to ease fiscal constraints and prevent&#13;
unnecessary cost escalation through supplier-induced demand for health services, measures will be&#13;
taken to control the future numbers of physicians, dentists and pharmacists trained in the country.&#13;
We already offer no guarantee of public sector employment to graduating health professionals, and&#13;
this policy Will be maintained.  In addition, we will use attrition (normal retirement, voluntary&#13;
privatization, etc.) to reduce the net number of publicly-employed physicians (currently totaling&#13;
4,516) by at least 200 before June 30, 1998. In terms of future supply, we will invoke numerus&#13;
clausus for enrollment in medical training programs, in order to maintain adequate ratios of&#13;
medical professionals to population and reverse excessive expansion of enrollments in recent years.&#13;
Enrollment for physicians' training will be decreased from 120 in academic year 1996/97 bv 20&#13;
percent annually for the next three years (academic v'ears 1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000). The&#13;
1999/2000 enrollment level is consistent with maintaining an adequate ratio of medical&#13;
professionals to population in the longer run, and will be extended over a longer period than the&#13;
proposed project implementation phase. If this limit of medical students per annum is maintained,&#13;
it would permit a ratio of 2.3 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants in the year 2010, given expected&#13;
demographic trends and attrition rates in the profession. This is close to the current ratio of 2.4&#13;
physicians per 1,000 inhabitants in our country, as well as to the current average for OECD&#13;
countries. If recent enrolLment rates of 150-200 students per annum were maintained, the ratio of&#13;
physicians to population would rise rapidly to around 2.6-2.7 by the vear 2010. For dentists' and&#13;
pharrnacists' training, average annual enrolLments have nearly doubled since 1991, and will be&#13;
reduced to an annual total of 75 students for dentistrv and 75 students for pharmacy for the&#13;
academic years 1996/97 through 1998/99 and beyond. Maintaining reasonable ratios will permrit&#13;
better remuneration of highly-trained health professionals--an expected trend as earnings diverge to&#13;
reflect skill levels in the market economy.&#13;
Disease prevention and health promotion. Long-term trends toward better health have&#13;
stagnated in recent years as a result of socioeconomic decline and reduced quality of health care&#13;
services and public health interventions. With an infant mortalitv rate which is twice the average&#13;
for Central and Eastem Europe and four times the average of Western Europe, and rapidly rising&#13;
rates of lifestyle-related chronic diseases (heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, etc.), it is&#13;
clear that improvements in health status in our country will depend on a renewed commitment to&#13;
disease prevention and health promotion. Our national prevention programs have been particularly&#13;
hard-hit by recent fiscal contraction. In 1993, legislation was adopted shifting funding of non-&#13;
salary material costs for national prevention programs to the general budget, to relieve financial&#13;
pressure on the Health Insurance Fund. However, budgetary allocations have been insufficient and&#13;
unfulfilled due to general fiscal distress. We have requested bridge financing under the proposed&#13;
IDA project to provide imported materials for five of the highest priority prevention programs: i)&#13;
Childhood Immunization, ii) Matemal and Child Health; iii) Tuberculosis Prevention, iv) AIDS&#13;
Prevention; and v) Blood Donation. In addition, we are committed to providing funding from the&#13;
general  budget for additional material and operating expenses (non-salary) for these five&#13;
programs, in the amounts of US$0.9 million equivalent in 1996, US$1.0 million equivalent in&#13;
1997 and US$1.2 million equivalent in 1998 for budget items agreed with IDA.  In addition to&#13;
these allocations, the general budget vill provide additional funding for the Childhood&#13;
Immunization Program, for timelv purchase of vaccines, syringes and needles as necessary.&#13;
Funding requirements are estimated at US$1.02 million equivalent in 1996, USS1.12 million&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
equivalent in 1997 and US$1.23 million equivalent in 1998. These finds will be allocated from&#13;
the general budget, unless a firm commitment for external funding is obtained. UNICEF has&#13;
already indicated its willingness to provide vaccines, syringes and needles as necessary for the&#13;
Childhood Immunization Program in 1996 and 1997, and we will cooperate closely with UNICEF&#13;
to ensure continued extemal funding in 1998, as well. Thus, throughout the irutial phase of reform&#13;
(1996-99), wve are committed to providing budgetary or external funding to ensure immunization&#13;
coverage rates of 95 percent or higher for the full range of childhood communicable diseases&#13;
addressed under the Immnunization Program.&#13;
Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply&#13;
At an estimated three percent, the share of national income spent on drugs in our country is&#13;
among the highest in the world. More than half of this is financed by the public sector, through&#13;
HIF reimbursements. Spending is high because prescribing practices favor overconsumption, while&#13;
registration, procurement, pricing and reimbursement policies favor higher-prices specialtv drugs&#13;
and limit competition in the market. Local prices for drugs are frequently five to ten times higher&#13;
than comparable world market prices. Our goals for pharmaceutical reform in the next few years&#13;
are to reduce local prices for essential drugs, facilitate the introduction of high-quality, lower-cost&#13;
drugs, encourage more rational prescribing practices and place appropriate limits on public sector&#13;
reimbursement of drugs to both public and pnrvate sector suppliers. Reforms will focus on the&#13;
following areas: i) revision of the legislative franework. ii) streamnlined registration for equivalent&#13;
products and authorization of generic substitution; iii) implementation of pricing policv which&#13;
favors lower-cost drugs, iv) adoption of essential drug lists for public sector facilities and&#13;
reimbursement, v) introduction of a reference price reimbursement system, vi) development of&#13;
competitive bidding procedures for public sector bulk procurement. and vii) promotion of rational&#13;
prescribing practices.&#13;
Revision of the le2islative framework. The Drug Law wnill be revised to meet European&#13;
standards and to reflect the reform agenda described below wvith respect to registration;,&#13;
substitution, pricing and public sector procurement and reimbursement. A satisfactor., draft Drug&#13;
Law has been submitted to IDA, and will be presented to Parliament for a first reading in coming&#13;
months. as a condition of effectiveness for the Health Sector Transition Project&#13;
Streamlined registration for equivalent products and authorization of zeneric&#13;
substitution.   The Drug Law will be simplified to allow for faster registration of generic&#13;
equivalents and other synonymous substances, particularly through elimination of cumbersome&#13;
requirements for clinical trials (replaced by requirements for bioequivalencv testing), and&#13;
development of an abridged application procedure. No modification will be made to existing&#13;
qualitv standards and controls, ensuring that qualitv requirements remain high regardless of cost.&#13;
In addition, the Drug Law will be modified to authorize and encourage licensed pharmacists to&#13;
substitute lower-cost synonymous substances (e.g. generic or branded-generic drugs) for brand&#13;
name prescriptions, unless specificallk prohibited by the prescribing physician.&#13;
Implementation of pricin2 policies which favor lower-cost dru2s. The Drug Law will&#13;
be modified to eliminate the proposed 20 percent mark-up for drug wholesalers and retailers and&#13;
give the national drug authorities the flexibility to introduce prcing policies which favor low%er cost&#13;
drugs. The earlier proposal, a fixed-proportion mark-up based on production costs, encourages&#13;
both the inflation of production costs and the marketing of higher-priced drugs. The revised Drug&#13;
Law will be submitted to Parliament as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed project. The&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
national drug authorities will then introduce a new pricing policy based on differential mark-ups&#13;
which favor essential and lower-cost drugs by June 30, 1977.&#13;
Adoption of essential dru2 lists for public sector facilities and reimbursement. The&#13;
MOH will issue a decree establishing essential drug lists for primary and hospital care in public&#13;
sector facilities.  The lists will be established through intensive preparation by our Drug&#13;
Com'ittee, which will also review the lists annually, updating as necessary. Procurement by&#13;
public sector facilities will be limited to the drugs on these lists, which are defined according to&#13;
their International Non-proprietary Names (INNs). Furthermore, reimbursement of drugs by the&#13;
1F will be limited on the basis of these essential drug lists. Adoption of the essential lists for&#13;
public sector procurement will take place by December 31, 1996. Limitations on the range of&#13;
drugs to be reimbursed by the HIF will go into effect, along with the introduction of reference price&#13;
reimbursement ceilings (see belowv), no later than December 31 1997, as part of a comprehensive&#13;
overhaul of HIF reimbursement policy.&#13;
Introduction of a reference price reimbursement system.    Ceilings for drug&#13;
reimbursement by -HF to health facilities and pharmacies will be established using reference prices&#13;
based on low-cost generic products. Additional costs for higher-priced brands will be borne out-of-&#13;
pocket by patients/customers in both public and private sector pharmacies.  Defining the&#13;
methodology for establishing reference prices will be the subject of a study carried out by HIF, to&#13;
be completed by June 30 1997.  Regulations establishing the reference price reimbursement&#13;
system, along *with limitations on the range of drugs to be reimbursed and revisions to copayment&#13;
policy for prescriptions will be adopted by December 31 1997, for immediate implementation.&#13;
Development of competitive biddine procedures for public sector bulk procurement.&#13;
Currently, drug procurement is carried out locally by individual public sector health facilities on a&#13;
relativelv small scale, wvith no common procedures to ensure competitive pricing. With essential&#13;
drug lists for public sector facilities in place, it will become easier to aggregate purchasing for the&#13;
public sector in order to reap the benefits of economies of scale.   We intend to introduce bulk&#13;
procurement for the public sector, and to carrv it out through a competitive bidding process to&#13;
ensure high quality at lower prices. Our Department of Pharmacv in the MOH will be responsible&#13;
for managing a training program to build capacity for competitive bulk procurement, vhile drafting&#13;
the regulations defining a public sector drug procurement process. These regulations will be&#13;
agreed with IDA, and adopted bv June 30 1997, with trial procurement according to regulation&#13;
(financed under the proposed IDA credit) taking place by December 31 1997. By June 30 1998,&#13;
all public sector purchases which can be grouped into bulk lots will be procured through this&#13;
competitive process. wvhile health facilities will be required to engage in comparative pricing for&#13;
small-scale procurement of non-standard items.&#13;
Promotion of rational grescribine Dractices. We intend to establish a National Drug&#13;
Information Center (NDIC) which would act as a clearinghouse for international information on&#13;
pharmaceutical products. as well as direct information campaigns aimed at prescriber, pharmacists&#13;
and the public. The NDIC wvould be established by December 31 1996, and would be responsible,&#13;
inter alha, for educating physicians and pharmacists on the benefits of prescribing bv lnternational&#13;

It would also inform the public about lower-cost pharmaceutical alternatives. In addition, the HIF&#13;
will do periodic analysis of prescribing patterns for drugs on the reimbursement list, identifying&#13;
and recommending changes in poor prescribing practices.&#13;
Based on the policies and actions described in this Letter, we would like to request IDA's&#13;
support for our health sector reform progran through a credit for the Health Sector Transition&#13;

Health Sector Transition Project&#13;
Proiect lmvlementation Plan&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) reflects the outcomes of the October 1995 pre-&#13;
appraisal mission and its work with the technical working groups of the Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH)'/, as well as subsequent discussions between the MOH and the Bank in&#13;
December 1995 concerning further refinements to project scope and content. It was&#13;
discussed with the Borrower and refinements made during negotiations in May 1996.&#13;
The PIP presents the overall framework for implementation of the Project by the&#13;
Borrower and outlines in detail activities, arrangements and responsibilities. While the&#13;
implementation environment of the project is inherently dynamic, this PIP seeks to&#13;
clearly outline the general principles, agreed by all parties, according to which the project&#13;
will be carried out.&#13;
A list of working group members is given in Appendix 1.&#13;

I. Project Description. Objectives and Components&#13;
1.            The primary objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project are to: (i) improve the&#13;
health of the population by improving the quality of basic health services; and (ii) support an initial phase&#13;
of policy reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice within the health&#13;
system. These objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms under three project components&#13;
with the specific objectives outlined below:&#13;
(a)    Health Finance and Management: to support (i) the Government's efforts to prepare&#13;
and implement health financing reforms, building on technical work begun during project&#13;
preparation, through policy studies and advocacy/public information campaigns; and&#13;
(ii) the future introduction of a case-mix hospital reimbursement scheme through&#13;
development and testing of an integrated medical and financial management information&#13;
system for public sector facilities.&#13;
(b)    Basic Health Services: to improve the quality and effectiveness of primary health care&#13;
services through (i) the provision of basic equipment kits to 250 rural health centers and&#13;
support for clinicians' continuing education in provision and management of care; and&#13;
(ii) support for selected prevention programs.&#13;
(c)    Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply : to promote more rational use of drugs through&#13;
(i) strengthening local capacity for competitive drug procurement; and (ii) developing&#13;
essential drugs lists for public sector health facilities.&#13;
The project will finance local and external technical assistance, local training, long- and short-term&#13;
fellowships and study tours, medical and laboratory testing and diagnostic equipment and supplies,&#13;
computer hardware and software, reference materials, office equipment, furniture, and minor civil works&#13;
to support the activities described below.&#13;
II. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
2.            Overall responsibility for implementation of Health Sector Transition Project rests&#13;
with the MOH, while responsibility for day-to-day coordination, management and monitoring rests&#13;
with the International Project Unit (IPU) established within the MOH. It is expected that the IPU&#13;
will also assume responsibility for the coordination of other donor-funded activities in the health&#13;
sector. In order to carry out its functions, the Unit will be staffed by a full-time Project Director,&#13;
supported by a "core team", financed under the project. This core team is comprised of: (i) a&#13;
procurement officer; (ii) a disbursement officer/accountant; and (iii) an administrative&#13;
assistant/translator. To assist this team, short-term technical support for the IPU will be provided for&#13;
under the project in a number of areas, inter alia, health policy development, procurement of goods&#13;
and services, project management, and administrative support services.&#13;

below. Initial start-up costs for appointment of key staff (i.e., the Director and the Procurement&#13;
Officer), equipment of the Unit, and staff training in procurement and project management are being&#13;
financed by a Project Preparation Facility (PPF; P983-0-MK) of US$223,500.&#13;

components of the project. Detailed cost tables and implementation schedules related to the specific&#13;
components are found in Section D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 9 of 65&#13;
COMPONENT (1): Health Finance and Management&#13;
6.            Overall responsibility for implementation of this component lies with the National Health&#13;
Insurance Fund (NHIF), a semi-autonomous fund under the supervision of the MOH, the director of&#13;
which reports to the Minister of Health. The NHIF will take principal responsibility for defining and&#13;
implementing the reforms supported under the project. In that capacity, the Fund will manage and&#13;
supervise the work of the foreign and local experts hired to carry out technical studies under the&#13;
component. The NHIF will coordinate and supervise the pilot activities (in capitation payment, integrated&#13;
information systems, etc.) in the two selected districts, collaborating with the District HIF (DHIF) offices,&#13;
the medical centers, PHC centers and District Institutes of Public Health. The Fund will also be&#13;
responsible for identifying qualified fellowship and study tour candidates to be trained as trainers for&#13;
outreach to DHIF and facilities' staff on issues concerning financial and administrative management.&#13;
Implementation of this local management training through seminars will be coordinated by the NHIF.&#13;
With respect to information system activities, the NHIF will oversee the work of the foreign and local&#13;
technical assistance hired to support the design of an integrated information system, the formulation of&#13;
an automation plan, and coordination of testing in selected pilot areas. Lastly, in collaboration with the&#13;
IPU, the NHIF will oversee the development of a public information and outreach strategy with respect&#13;
to the content and implementation of reforms.&#13;
7.            The Technical Committee (TC) for this component (formally the technical working&#13;
group established during project preparation) will be headed by the director of the NHIF. The TC will&#13;
play an important role in reviewing the series of technical studies regarding proposed reforms, and&#13;
making final recommendations to the MOH on the policy reforms. The Committee will advise and assist&#13;
the IPU in developing technical specifications for goods to be procured under this component, as well&#13;
as terms of reference for consultants. Finally, the TC will supervise the work of technical assistance to&#13;
establish a Hospital Management Association which, once operational, will develop and carry out training&#13;
programs for medical professionals. Technical assistance will be provided under the project to give initial&#13;
support to the Association in this task.&#13;
8.            Under the project, pilot activities are foreseen in two selected districts (selection of&#13;
suitable pilots districts is a condition of negotiation). The DHIF offices of the pilots areas will oversee&#13;
implementation of activities, reporting to the NHIF. The DHIFs will also coordinate the distribution of&#13;
equipment to be procured for carrying out pilot activities, and together with the selected medical centers,&#13;
primary health care centers and the district offices of the IPH will be responsible for any necessary site&#13;
preparation (i.e., installation of phone lines, electrical connections, etc. for hardware) and actual&#13;
implementation of activities.&#13;
COMPONENT (2): Basic Health Services&#13;
9.            Primary responsibility for implementation of this component lies with the Office of the&#13;
Assistant Minister for Primary and Preventive Health Care (AMPPHC). This Office will supervise&#13;
the work of the procurement agency, in collaboration with the IPU, hired to ensure the purchase and&#13;
distribution of: (i) basic medical equipment kits for rural primary health centers (PHCs) (to be purchased&#13;
from UNIPAC) as well as other equipment and furniture for rural PHCs (the latter being financed by the&#13;
Government); and (ii) various medical consumables, vaccines, and promotional supplies needed for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 10 of 65&#13;
prevention programs supported under the project.3/ The AMPPHC will be responsible for selecting&#13;
qualified candidates from within the MOH for training in primary health care strategies and planning, and&#13;
will supervise the development of continuing education programs for PHC physicians and nursing staff.&#13;
Finally, the Office will develop final recommendations to the MOH on quality assurance standards for&#13;
PHC and will approve any action plan for quality assurance monitoring and supervision.&#13;
10.          In developing continuing education programs aimed at broadening the skills of PHC&#13;
personnel, the medical associations (Physicians' and Nurses' Associations) and related medical faculties&#13;
(physicians' and nursing faculties) will play a key role. These programs will seek to give greater&#13;
emphasis to a family medicine orientation in medical education, and to primary and secondary prevention&#13;
strategies. In addition, these associations and faculties will take the primary role in defining--for&#13;
presentation to the Office of the AMPPHC--the action plan for primary care quality assurance monitoring&#13;
and supervision mentioned in the preceding paragraph.&#13;
II.          Implementation of activities supporting priority prevention programs under the project&#13;
will be the responsibility of the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH), reporting to the Office of&#13;
the AMPPHC. The NIPH will assume direct responsibility for carrying out immunization program&#13;
activities, maternal and child health care programs (namely, cervical cancer screening and neonatal&#13;
intensive care support in conjunction with the University Hospital), and AIDS screening activities&#13;
provided for under the project. The Institute will also supervise implementation of project inputs in&#13;
tuberculosis screening and prevention, and blood donation program support through, respectively, the&#13;
National Institutes of Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis and Blood Transfusion. Through representation&#13;
on the TC for basic health services (see below), the NIPH will provide inputs to related equipment&#13;
specifications and consultancy terms of reference under this component. Responsibility for receipt and&#13;
distribution of medical consumables and equipment for implementation of prevention programs will also&#13;
lie with the Institute, as will ensuring the development and dissemination of promotional materials for&#13;
each program.&#13;
12.          The TC for basic health services will be chaired by the Assistant Minister for Primary&#13;
and Preventive Health Care, and will be comprised of representatives from each of the agencies involved&#13;
in carrying out the programs supported under the project (see preceding paragraph). The Committee will&#13;
also provide technical support to the IPU in formulating consultant terms of reference, finalizing&#13;
equipment specifications, and inputs to the development and use of promotional materials.&#13;
COMPONENT (3): Pharmaceutical Policy and SUPDIV&#13;
13.          The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) in the MOH will have overall responsibility&#13;
for implementation of this component. It will play a key role in the reform process, managing each of&#13;
the successive steps of legislative revision and definition of the regulatory framework concerning drug&#13;
registration, pricing, and substitution. While the NHIF will take the lead in managing technical assistance&#13;
for the definition of a reference price reimbursement system for drugs, and for testing and implementing&#13;
3/     The role of the procurement agency in the competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals for the&#13;
public sector is discussed under Component (3), Pharmaceutical Supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 11 of 65&#13;
that system, the DoP will provide inputs throughout the process. Moreover, the DoP will take the lead&#13;
role in the formulation of public sector competitive bidding procedures for the procurement of drugs and&#13;
vaccines, including management of training for concerned staff in those procedures. The Department&#13;
will also be responsible for managing the consultants carrying out technical studies pertaining to the&#13;
reforms, developing essential drug lists, as well as promoting rational drug use among prescribers and&#13;
consumers in collaboration with the Drug Information Center to be established in the Institute of&#13;
Pharmacy (see para. 14 below).&#13;
14.           With respect to drug procurement, the DoP will supervise the work of the contracted&#13;
procurement agency selected to procure and distribute drugs, medical equipment and consumables under&#13;
the project according to competitive bidding procedures. The procurement agency, to be selected as a&#13;
condition of effectiveness, will be fully equipped for, and experienced in, accepting and processing&#13;
orders, and ensuring secure warehousing and timely distribution of items purchased through large-scale&#13;
procurement.&#13;
15.           The National Drug Information Center and the Center for Adverse Reactions will be&#13;
established and operated under the responsibility of the Institute of Pharmacy (Faculty of Medicine).&#13;
The Institute will ensure that necessary site preparation is carried out prior to arrival of equipment,&#13;
finalize specifications for required equipment with the IPU, identify and request, with assistance from the&#13;
IPU, appropriate drug information reference materials, and appoint qualified staff to both Centers. A&#13;
public information strategy for drugs will also be developed with some assistance from WHO in addition&#13;
to support provided under the project. The NIPH will oversee the development of the quality control&#13;
laboratory, including provision of support to the IPU on technical specifications for lab equipment, site&#13;
preparation, and the selection of qualified candidates for training to be carried out.&#13;
16.           The TC for pharmaceuticals will review proposals put forward by the technical consultants&#13;
and finalize recommendations for pharmaceutical policy reform for Ministerial improvement. This will&#13;
include recommendations on: drug registration, essential lists, pricing policy, registration and testing,&#13;
substitution policy, reimbursement, and public sector procurement.&#13;

III. Project Cost and Financing, Procurement Arrangements,&#13;
and Disbursements&#13;
A. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
17.          Total project cost is estimated at US$19.4 million (or MKD 737 million equivalent)&#13;
including contingencies. An estimated US$16.9 million equivalent (or 87% of total costs) will be&#13;
financed by the IDA credit of SDR 11.8 million (including a PPF (P-983-0-MK) totalling US$0.2 million&#13;
equivalent). The Credit will finance 100% of the estimated foreign exchange cost (US$14.5 million) and&#13;
48 % of estimated local costs (US$2.4 million). The remaining 13 % of total project costs will be financed&#13;
by the Government (US$2.5 million). All imported goods and services destined for health institutions&#13;
and related purposes--including those financed under the Project--are exempt from taxation and customs&#13;
duties. Any local taxes which may be incurred on locally purchased project items will be financed by&#13;
the Government.  Incremental recurrent costs included in the project (estimated US$0.3 million)&#13;
comprising operating costs, equipment maintenance service contracts, incremental staff salaries, and&#13;
supplies will be financed by the Government. A PPF (P-983-0-MK) of US$223,500 is supporting the&#13;
establishment of the IPU and training of IPU staff; and a PHRD Grant financed by the Government of&#13;
Japan totalling US$0.6 million equivalent has been used to support project preparation, including&#13;
preparatory studies for health financing reform.&#13;
18.          Estimated project costs by component are shown below  in Table 1 (MKD and&#13;
lS$equivalent). Table 2 presents project costs by expenditure category (including contingencies).&#13;

20.   Basis for cost estimates. Cost estimates are derived from those assumed under other projects in&#13;
the Eastern and Central Europe Region, including FYR Macedonia. Additional sources include relevant&#13;
equipment catalogues and supplier quotations, as well as technical estimates for applications software and&#13;
hardware. Estimates for consultant and training costs also reflect experiences in the Region. Incremental&#13;
staff salaries included in the project are based on current government rates. Project costs have been&#13;
estimated in US dollars, with the local equivalent calculated on the basis of the February 1996 exchange&#13;
rate of 38 MKD/US$1.&#13;
21.   Contingency Allowances. Project costs include contingencies for unforeseen physical variations&#13;
(totalling US$1.2 million) equivalent to 5% for technical assistance and training, and 10% for other&#13;
project items. Annual inflation of 2.4% is assumed for both foreign and local costs during the three-year&#13;
implementation period.&#13;
22.   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$14.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 29 of 65&#13;
million including contingencies, or 75% of total project cost. Calculations of the foreign exchange&#13;
component are based on the following assumptions: (i) 100% for medical equipment and supplies,&#13;
reference materials, computer software and hardware, external technical assistance and training; (ii) 60%&#13;
for office equipment; (iii) 90% for vehicles; and (iv) 0% for furniture, local technical assistance and&#13;
training.&#13;
23.    Customs Duties and Taxes. The Ministry of Finance has confirmed that imported goods destined&#13;
for health-related institutions and purposes are exempt from taxes and duties. However, locally purchased&#13;
medical and computer equipment is taxed at 5%; and office equipment at 25%. Under the project, it is&#13;
expected that most medical and computer equipment will be imported, as will most office equipment (with&#13;
the exception of about US$400,000 of goods purchased through local shopping). Given the small amount&#13;
involved, no estimation of taxes has been included in project costs. The Borrower does recognize that&#13;
it will be responsible for meeting all duty and/or tax obligations should they arise.&#13;
24.   Incremental Recurrent Costs. Project cost estimates include US$0.3 million (2% of total project&#13;
cost) in incremental operating costs attributable to the Project during the three-year period. These costs&#13;
comprise equipment operation and maintenance, minor operating expenses and supplies, and incremental&#13;
staff salaries. Annual incremental operating costs are estimated at MKD 5.0 million or less than 1% of&#13;
the recurrent health budget. These costs will be more than compensated for through a number of&#13;
measures being undertaken by the MOH, inter alia, savings generated by competitive procurement of&#13;
pharmaceuticals and reductions in public funding for medical training.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
25.    Project inputs, estimated costs, and proposed procurement arrangements for those inputs&#13;
financed under the IDA Credit are summarized in Table 5 below. Incremental recurrent costs, civil&#13;
works, and furniture, all of which are financed 100% by Government counterpart funds, are shown&#13;
under the Non-Bank Financed (NBF) column.&#13;

26.    Civil works (including site preparation for information system pilots, neonatal care unit, and drug&#13;
control laboratory and animal house) totalling an estimated US$0.8 million will be financed entirely by&#13;
the Government and procured according to its procedures.&#13;
27.    Goods to be procured include medical and laboratory equipment and supplies, drugs and&#13;
consumables, computer hardware and software, office equipment, furniture, promotional materials for&#13;
prevention programs, and vehicles (one mobile clinic for tuberculosis screening, and one vehicle for&#13;
cancer screening activities).&#13;
28.    Furniture amounting to about US$0.6 million will be financed by the Government and procured&#13;
through relevant local procedures. For other goods under the project, equipment contracts of a value&#13;
exceeding US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the IDA's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" (January 1995). Equipment and supplies will be grouped into a small number of&#13;
packages (about nine) to be procured through ICB to encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk&#13;
procurement, including: laboratory and diagnostic equipment and supplies (two packages); neonatal&#13;
intensive care unit equipment; other medical equipment; replacement x-ray equipment; drugs and&#13;
consumables; reproductive health supplies (including contraceptives); mobile clinic for tuberculosis&#13;
screening; and computer hardware. Computer hardware and peripherals (representing about US$1.3&#13;
million) will be procured with careful consideration of compatibility and availability of maintenance&#13;
services. Equipment procured through ICB will account for about 70% (US$9.4 million) of total goods&#13;
to be procured under the project. Domestic preference would not be applied.&#13;
29.   Other procurement procedures. Contracts for equipment estimated to cost less than US$200,000&#13;
per contract, not to exceed an aggregate amount of US$0.6 million equivalent, will be awarded through&#13;
International Shopping (IS) procedures, based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three suppliers from two eligible countries in accordance with IDA guidelines. Items that cannot be&#13;
grouped, or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 per contract, or off-&#13;
the-shelf items, amounting to about US$0.4 million, will be awarded through National Shopping (NS)&#13;
by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers, in accordance with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. About US$2.2 million in basic medical equipment (e.g., stethoscopes, scales) destined for&#13;
rural primary health centers will be purchased as catalogue items from UNIPAC (UNICEF). Other&#13;
contracts for goods which IDA agrees are of proprietary nature (e.g., unique reference materials,&#13;
technical manuals, software), amounting to about US$0.1 million may be awarded after direct&#13;
negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
30.    Consultants for technical assistance services financed under the project (totalling about US$2.2&#13;
million) will be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). It is estimated that five&#13;
packages for technical assistance will be required (see Procurement Schedule in Table 6 below), including&#13;
specialist services for: health financing and management, reference pricing, pharmaceutical advisory&#13;
services, procurement and distribution services (financed by Government), as well as project management&#13;
support. As needed, the services of individual specialists (e.g., to develop computer applications software&#13;
or technical specifictions for medical equipment) (estimated total value US$250,000) will also be&#13;
contracted on the basis of shortlists of eligible candidates and comparison of at least three curricula vitae.&#13;
&#13;

Local training under the project is estimated at US$0.5 million, and external training at US$1.2 million.&#13;
Approximately US$0.7 million of this training under the Health Finance &amp; Management Component will&#13;
be provided as one component of the related consultant services contract. For other external training,&#13;
institutions will be selected through shortlisting in accordance with IDA procedures.&#13;

32.    In compliance with IDA procedures, standard bidding documents will be used for all ICB&#13;
procurement. IDA will review all final equipment lists, technical specifications, packaging of bids, and&#13;
updated package values. With respect to contracts for goods estimated to cost US$200,000 or more, the&#13;
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix I of the Guidelines shall apply. Prior review&#13;
(including requests for direct contracting) is expected to cover over 85 % of the total estimated base cost&#13;
for goods procured under the project. Remaining contracts will be subject to selective post award review.&#13;
Consultant contracts, with the exception of contracts with firms not exceeding US$100,000 each in value,&#13;
and for individuals not exceeding US$50,000 each in value, will be subject to prior review. The Bank&#13;
will, however, review terms of reference, short lists, and consultants' profiles for all individual&#13;
consultants.&#13;
33.    The IPU will coordinate and monitor all procurement activities for goods and services under the&#13;
project, including tracking of those activities carried out by the selected agent for procurement and&#13;
distribution of drugs and consumables. In addition, information technology equipment will be procured&#13;
with the assistance of external experts under the related subcomponents, in collaboration with the IPU.&#13;
Short-term technical assistance (both external and local) is included in the project to assist the IPU in&#13;
performing these functions, including preparation of bidding documents and technical specifications. The&#13;
procurement officer has already received training in equipment procurement funded under the PPF, and&#13;
further training for IPU core staff in procurement and project management principles is foreseen under&#13;
the project. The IPU will also be responsible for informing IDA of contract awards, and would include&#13;
the following procurement-related information in periodic progress reports: (a) updated cost estimates,&#13;
by component and category of expenditure, for the project; (b) updated procurement timetable for goods&#13;
and equipment; and (c) status of aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
34.    Procurement and distribution of drugs, consumables, and medical equipment for rural primary&#13;
health centers will be carried out by the local procurement agency selected by the Government. It is&#13;
envisaged that procurement of these items will be carried out in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement (January 1995). The MOH will enter into a cont-act with the selected agency to ensure the&#13;
procurement and distribution of these items, and all fees related to performance of these services will be&#13;
financed by the Government (an estimated US$0.8 million) as part of its counterpart contribution to the&#13;
project. Signing of this agreement, the provisions of which will be acceptable to IDA, is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
35.    A General Procurement Notice was prepared and finalized for publication during negotiations (see&#13;
Appendix 3). A Project Launch Workshop will be held prior to effectiveness (tentatively scheduled for&#13;
July 1996).&#13;
C. Disbursements, Special Account, and Audit Requirements&#13;
36.    Disbursements. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years,&#13;
considerably shorter than the relevant sector profile in the Region of about seven years. This project is&#13;
the second operation in the human resources sectors in the FYR Macedonia, the first having become&#13;
effective less than one year ago. Therefore, the country disbursement profile is speculative. However,&#13;
the shorter implementation period for the present project reflects the nature of the project as a source of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 35 of 65&#13;
bridge financing during the initial stages of the transition and in support of the first phase of the&#13;
Government's health reform program, as well as the simplicity of the project's design. The closing date&#13;
will be March 31, 2000. Estimated disbursements are shown in Table 7 below.&#13;

Cumulative as % of total    37.0           85.0         100.0&#13;
The IDA credit will be disbursed as follows:&#13;
(a)    for equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of ex-factory local costs, and 85%&#13;
of other items procured locally;&#13;
(b)    for technical assistance, local and external training: 100% of all expenditures; and&#13;
(c)    repayment of PPF.&#13;
All disbursements will be fully documented with the exception of: (i) goods contracts of a value less than&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent; (ii) contracts with consulting firms of a value less than US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
and with individual consultants of a value less than US$50,000; and (iii) local training--for which&#13;
disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). The required supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained by the IPU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made available&#13;
for review by the auditors and by visiting staff upon request.  The responsibility for monitoring&#13;
disbursements of the IDA credit, as well as Government counterpart financing, will lie with the IPU.&#13;
37.    Special Accoun.. To facilitate project implementation, the Government has established, under&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account in US Dollars in the National Bank of&#13;
Macedonia. Payments for eligible expenditures may be made by the IPU out of this account. The&#13;
Special Account will have a total authorized allocation of US$1.0 million. The initial deposit will amount&#13;
to US$500,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus the total amount&#13;
of all outstanding special commitments shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$5.0 million. The&#13;
Special Account will be replenished on a monthly basis or whenever the undisbursed balance falls below&#13;
an amount equal to 50% or less of Authorized Allocation, whichever occurs first. Monthly bank&#13;
statements of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the Borrower will accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests. The Special Account funds should be used for all payments of a value less than&#13;
20% of the Authorized Allocation.&#13;
38.    Audit Requirements. The IPU will maintain separate accounts, in conformity with international&#13;
accounting practices. Project accounts, including the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank"&#13;
(March 1982). The Borrower will provide to IDA (within six months of the end of each fiscal year) an&#13;
audit report of such scope and detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank on disbursements against certified SOEs. The separate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 36 of 65&#13;
opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures&#13;
and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal&#13;
applications.&#13;
D. Reporting Requirements&#13;
39.    The PCU will prepare semi-annual descriptive and financial reports on each project component,&#13;
objective and activity (beginning from the date of Credit Effectiveness). These reports will be due in&#13;
January and July of each year, and will describe: (a) current status; (b) deviations, if any, from the&#13;
implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. These reports,&#13;
in addition to the SAR and PIP, will form the basic documents for supervision of the project. Project&#13;
reporting, as well as supervision, will also focus on in-depth reviews of the agreed policy agenda (see&#13;
Letter of Development Policy, Annex I to the SAR), the consistency of activities for each component and&#13;
subcomponent with agreements reached at negotiations, performance of the implementing agencies,&#13;
assessment of emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters, and possible follow-up operations&#13;
which could be supported by the Bank. Project supervision will also include a review of project&#13;
expenditures and availability of financial resources, substantive discussions with technical assistance&#13;
groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various components, and discussions with&#13;
responsible authorities. A mid-term review of progress under the project will be conducted by IDA and&#13;
the Borrower by March 31, 1998.&#13;
E. Supervision Requirements&#13;
40.    Supervision. Recognizing that the Health Sector Transition Project is a first generation project&#13;
in the health sector in FYR Macedonia, and that the implementing agency and related institutions have&#13;
no previous experience in carrying out an investment project of this magnitude, the supervision effort&#13;
required during the initial phases of implementation will inevitably be higher than average. Furthermore,&#13;
in planning for project supervision, it is important to distinguish between time spent on routine&#13;
supervision matters, and time spent providing substantive policy advice to the Government and other&#13;
institutions on implementing its reform agenda. In the given implementation environment, the provision&#13;
of both types of assistance will put a heavy demand on resources.&#13;
41.    Table 8 below provides an estimate of the volume and type of supervision inputs envisaged under&#13;
the project. Resident Mission support through local staff is not presently feasible since the Resident&#13;
Mission in Skopje is newly established. However, once operationally staffed and trained, efforts will be&#13;
made to involve local staff in supervision activities. Delegation of specific supervision responsibilities&#13;
to permanent field staff would likely not be feasible until at least the second year of the project, with&#13;
substantive and operational backstopping support continuing to be provided by Headquarters staff and/or&#13;
the Budapest Human Resource Hub.&#13;

IV. Monitoring And Evaluation&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
42.    Monitoring is a continual process of assessing whether project resources (inputs) are being used&#13;
as planned to carry out project activities (outputs). Monitoring the use of project resources will be done&#13;
by tracking inputs according to component, activity and expenditure category, as outlined in Table 9:&#13;
Input Indicators. Updated disbursement information will be provided in this format in the project's semi-&#13;
annual Progress Reports, to be prepared by the IPU. Monitoring outputs under the project is more&#13;
complex, involving both implementation of project activities and implementation of the broader policy&#13;
reform agenda. For the former, completion of key project activities will be monitored as indicated in&#13;
Table 10: Output Indicators, and summarized in the semi-annual Progress Reports. For the latter,&#13;
progress in implementing reforms will be jointly assessed by Government and IDA on an annual basis.&#13;
A timetable of expected progress, with carefully defined progress benchmarks, has been summarized in&#13;
the policy matrix attached to the Government's Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1).&#13;
Project Evaluation&#13;
42.    Evaluation is a process of assessing the extent to which a project achieves its objectives. The&#13;
objectives of the Health Sector Transition Project aim to affect outcomes related to health status, services&#13;
and financing. Broad outcome indicators have been selected in each of these areas. The indicators were&#13;
selected on the basis of relevance to the project objectives, sensitivity to project activities, ease of data&#13;
collection and parsimony. It is recognized that changes in most of these indicators cannot be causally&#13;
linked directly to project activities, since the project is only one of multiple factors impacting on health&#13;
status and services during the short (three-year) implementation period. However, annual monitoring of&#13;
these indicators will provide evidence of overall trends in the health status of the population, the&#13;
effectiveness of health services and the efficiency of public spending for health--all of which the project&#13;
seeks to influence positively.&#13;

APPENDIX 2: MATRIX OF PROCUREMENT AND REPORTING RESPONSBIILITIES&#13;
The following matrix seeks to clarify responsibilities for key steps in procurement and reporting during&#13;
implementation among the various players involved in the project. The following definitions are used&#13;
in the matrix:&#13;
(a)    International Project Unit (IPU) refers to the unit in the MOH responsible for the&#13;
general administration of the credit and coordination of project activities. The IPU is&#13;
comprised of a project director, procurement officer, disbursement officer/accountant,&#13;
and administrator/translator. The IPU may be supported by short-term consultants in&#13;
specific areas in order that it be able to more efficiently fulfill its role.&#13;
(b)    Technical Committee (TC) refers to the technical working groups established during&#13;
project preparation for each subcomponent and maintained throughout implementation to&#13;
provide technical support to the IPU.&#13;
The IPU is encouraged to organize regular meetings of representatives of the TCs, as well as any other&#13;
individuals involved in project activities both within and outside of the MOH, in order to keep all parties&#13;
up-to-date on project status and identify obstacles earlv on in order to seek mutually agreeable solutions.&#13;
Meetings should ideally be organized around an established agenda, with time allotted for questions or&#13;
other open discussion. The IPU Director will be responsible for keeping the Minister of Health informed&#13;
of the outcome of these meetings, and will seek his guidance in resolving issues if necessary.&#13;

GENERAL PROCUREMENT NOTICE&#13;
FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR TRANSITION PROJECT&#13;
The Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is expected to&#13;
receive a Credit from the International Development Association (IDA) in an amount equivalent to SDR 11.8&#13;
million (US$16.9 million equivalent) to support a Health Sector Transition Project. The objectives of the&#13;
project are to improve the health of the population by improving the quality of basic health services, and to&#13;
support an initial phase of policy reforms to enhance cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and patient choice&#13;
within the health system.&#13;
The project is comprised of the following components:&#13;
(a)    Health Finance and Management: to support (i) the Government's efforts to prepare and implement&#13;
health financing reforms, building on technical work begun during project preparation, through policy&#13;
studies and advocacy/public information campaigns; and (ii) the future introduction of a case-mix&#13;
hospital reimbursement scheme through development and testing of an integrated medical and&#13;
financial management information system for public sector facilities.&#13;
(b)    Basic Health Services: to improve the quality and effectiveness of primary health care services&#13;
through (i) the provision of basic equipment kits to 250 rural health centers and support for clinicians'&#13;
continuing education in provision and management of care; and (ii) support for selected prevention&#13;
programs.&#13;
(c)    Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply: to promote more rational use of drugs through (i) strengthening&#13;
local capacity for competitive drug procurement; and (ii) developing essential drugs lists for public&#13;
sector health facilities.&#13;
The Government intends to apply the proceeds of the Credit to finance local and foreign technical&#13;
assistance, local training as well as long- and short-term fellowships and study tours, medical equipment and&#13;
supplies, computer hardware and software, reference materials, and office equipment, in support of the above&#13;
components. All goods and services to be procured under the project would be tendered through procedures&#13;
in accordance with the procurement guidelines of the International Development Association. Among the&#13;
items to be procured through International Competitive Bidding are laboratory testing and diagnostic&#13;
equipment, medical equipment and consumables, selected pharmaceutical products, and computer hardware&#13;
and software. Advertisement of initial tenders is expected by December 1996.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page I of 6&#13;
Selection Amona Alternative Project Designs&#13;
1.     The project's objectives--to improve the health of the population by enhancing the quality of basic&#13;
health services and support an initial phase of policy reforms to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal&#13;
sustainability and patient choice within the health system--complement and help achieve the Government's&#13;
overall economic reform strategy. The Government has sought to maintain basic social services in order&#13;
to maintain stability and avoid entanglement in the war in the former Yugoslavia while beginning the&#13;
process of building a modern growing economy. The Government has been successful in achieving this&#13;
goal in spite of a recent assassination attempt on the President's life. The proposed project supports this&#13;
effort by preventing the deterioration in basic health services and beginning the process of policy change&#13;
that is necessary to build an efficient, high-quality health care system.&#13;
2.     The proposed project has three components. Alternatives considered for each component are&#13;
presented below and are evaluated in terms of achieving the project's objectives.  Assessment of&#13;
alternatives to health care investment--such as education--were beyond the scope of the work undertaken&#13;
for this project, but were considered by Government in defining priorities for World Bank assistance.&#13;
As a practical matter, the Government has weighed sector alternatives and selected this project as one that&#13;
meets its overall policy objectives and criteria for World Bank assistance.&#13;
3.    In all cases the status quo is used as one alternative and depending on the component or sub-&#13;
component other reasonable alternatives were considered. Factors which determined the selection of the&#13;
proposed activities included, in no particular order: 1) programs most likely to achieve the project's&#13;
objectives; 2) activities that lay the foundation for sustained change; 3) alternatives likely to be achieved&#13;
within the budget and human resource constraints of the country and the health care system; 4) the cost-&#13;
effectiveness of the alternatives; and 5) politic.al and implementation feasibility.&#13;
Component 1: Health Finance and Managemnent&#13;
4.     Activities in Component I consist of 1) health financing reforms, 2) information systems, and 3)&#13;
building the technical capacity of the NHIF and health care managers.&#13;
Health Financing Reforms&#13;
5.     All of the health financing reforms are interrelated, and along with the other activities are&#13;
designed as a package to lead to a more efficient health care financing system.  Many of these&#13;
investments, such as the accounting and information systems, lay the ground work for the adoption of&#13;
new ways to pay for services which relate costs to services provided, and which introduce incentives in&#13;
the system for efficient and effective behavior by health care providers. The ultimate success of these&#13;
policy reforms can be measured by indicators of efficiency (e.g. length of stay and costs per patient day)&#13;
and quality (e.g. readmission rates, infection rates, and patient satisfaction).&#13;
6.     Revision of user fees - The first policy reform envisions revision of the user fees and co-payment&#13;
policy. A technical study will be followed by specific reform options including a reevaluation of&#13;
exemptions granted and the establishment of lump sum user fees. Exemptions under the present system&#13;
are extremely broad, and subject to abuse, leading to inequity in the application of fees, and exacerbating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
the complexity of administration. While copayments of insured patients, and to a larger extent, user fees&#13;
from the uninsured (many firms are failing to pay insurance contributions for workers, creating a large&#13;
pool of uninsured) have contributed to the revenues of health facilities (10-15 percent of total revenues&#13;
in recent years), the present system has generated discontent due to its inequitable application and impact&#13;
on access to care.&#13;
7.     The status quo offers no advantages over the proposed project. The proposed project will study&#13;
the issue, and then implement an administratively simpler and more equitable system for revenue&#13;
collection. The level of revenue collection can be set where policy desires within a far simpler system&#13;
to administer. The by-product will be the establishment of incentives for efficiency of health care use&#13;
in conformity with project objectives. Alternative structures of the user fee--i.e., a percentage of health&#13;
care fees versus a lump sum fee--will be consider during the technical analysis. Finally this is an area&#13;
identified for reform by the MOH. As such, it will enjoy the political support of the MOH and be&#13;
implemented aggressively in spite of expected resistance from the broad group of currently exempted&#13;
patients.&#13;
8.     Definition of a fiscally-sustainable benefits package for coverage by the NHIF - The objective&#13;
here is to define what is fundable given the limited budget of the NHIF. Instead of claiming to fund&#13;
everything, this reform will define what should be covered as the basic package by the NHIF, based on&#13;
the burden of disease and cost effectiveness of treatment, while establishing a supplemental benefits&#13;
package--and appropriate supplemental premium--for other services. A basic benefits package will be&#13;
defined which will prevent additional accumulation of financial arrears and allow gradual elimination of&#13;
the existing stock of arrears.  This is a first step in ensuring that basic services which prevent&#13;
deterioration in health status are insured, while beginning to establish a relationship between payment,&#13;
incentives, and the cost of services. This is essential to achieve the goal of efficient provision of care.&#13;
The alternative--i.e. the status quo--has nothing to recommend it. Instead it will continue the situation&#13;
where resource use is unrelated to real economic costs or the provision of efficient, high-quality care.&#13;
Expenditure control will remain impossible, leading to continued buildup of financial arrears in the health&#13;
sector (arrears accumulated every year since 1990 equal MKD 1.4 billion--about 12 percent of total health&#13;
expenditures in 1995). Until this situation is changed the objectives of the project cannot be met. This&#13;
is a first but necessary step to establish a financing system that promotes efficient high quality care.&#13;
9.     Adoption of a capitation payment system for primary care - The alternatives considered were the&#13;
status quo or movement to a fee-for-service payment system. The status quo consists of predominantly&#13;
public sector primary health care services, which have no separate budgetary allocation. Primary health&#13;
centers lie at the bottom of a budgeting hierarchy--and are, therefore, shortchanged--with funding&#13;
provided largely according to staffing, rather than services provided or patients served. No benefits&#13;
package has been defined which primary care centers are expected to provide, and there is no functional&#13;
means of allowing patient choice and development of private sector alternatives to public sector care.&#13;
These problems, coupled with recent resource constraints, have resulted in low quality care, and a&#13;
tendency for patients to bypass the primary care system altogether, leading to inappropriate use of high-&#13;
cost hospital facilities. Thus, continuation of the status quo is an inefficient and ineffective use of health&#13;
resources.&#13;
10.    Another alternative is to move to a fee-for-service payment system, often favored by the medical&#13;
profession. Such systems in other countries have led to supplier-induced demand for services (i.e.&#13;
doctors supplying unnecessary services about which patients are unable to make informed judgments),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
resulting in cost escalation. Indeed, FYR Macedonia already has a legally-mandated system of payment&#13;
for providers modeled on the German points system of fees for services. Since 1991, the NHIF has&#13;
attempted to reimburse private sector providers--mostly for primary and other ambulatory services--on&#13;
this basis. Attempts have been largely abandoned due to uncontrolled cost escalation and perceived abuse&#13;
of the system. False Llaims for reimbursement, excessive supply of services and a general inability of&#13;
NHIF to verify claims has brought fee-for-service payments to a halt.&#13;
11.    The project will support devzlopment of a capitation payment mechanism for primary care. Such&#13;
a system has the following advantages over the alternatives examined: i) a defined benefits package which&#13;
all primary care providers must offer; ii) creation of a separate budget allocation for primary care within&#13;
the NHIF; iii) a predetermined financial outflow (enhancing fiscal sustainability) which transfers financial&#13;
risk to providers, creating incentives for efficient care; iv) funds following patients, allowing patients'&#13;
choice of primary care provider, thereby creating incentives for quality care; v) equal remuneration of&#13;
public and private sector providers, stimulating private sector development. A capitation mechanism,&#13;
which allows funds to follow patients, is the equivalent of giving vouchers to patients to purchase their&#13;
package of primary care benefits. It is an overall demand-side approach to stimulating the provision of&#13;
appropriate primary  health services.   The project supports this broad demand-side approach,&#13;
complemented with narrower supply-side interventions where necessary (see Component II: Basic Health&#13;
Services, below).&#13;
Integrated Medical and Financial Information System&#13;
12.    The design, testing and introduction of a medical and financial information system at the hospital&#13;
level, linked to the NHIF and including enhanced reporting, are key activities of Component 1. The&#13;
status quo offers no accounting system that links economic costs to inputs employed or outputs provided.&#13;
Measurements of appropriateness, effectiveness or efficiency of care are not possible in the hospital or&#13;
primary health care units. Most data processing at the facility level is manual, and the NHIF is not&#13;
linked by computer to hospitals. Data collection and processing is inefficient, most policy-relevant data&#13;
is lost, and little to no data analysis is undertaken. Given that district HIF offices responsible for paying&#13;
most bills are not electronically linked to the national HIF office,  information that could allow&#13;
establishment of efficiency benchmarks nationwide--and improve policy making--is not available to the&#13;
NHIF and the MOH.&#13;
13.    In short, the status quo does not allow for the achievement of stated project objectives with&#13;
respect to increasing cost-effectiveness and fiscal sustainability in the health system. With its general&#13;
benefits for financial management, the integrated medical and financial information system also lays the&#13;
essential foundation for some type of case-mix based hospital payment system that relates real economic&#13;
cost to reimbursement (such as diagnosis-related groups--DRGs). Technical study to introduce such a&#13;
system in FYR Macedonia is anticipated under the project, using data from the pilot testing of the&#13;
information system. In countries where payment systems such as DRGs have been implemented, large&#13;
savings have been achieved. In the United States, implementation in 1983 of the Prospective Payment&#13;
System (PPS) for hospital services, which is based on DRGs, produced sudden and dramatic changes in&#13;
utilization rates and Medicare hospital payments. The average annual rate of change in hospital payments&#13;
went from 18 percent in the decade before PPS was introduced (1972-83) to 7 percent during the&#13;
following decade (1983-92). The share of payments going to hospitals also dropped from 64 percent in&#13;
1983 to 54 percent in 1992, reflecting a shift to outpatient settings and greater use of preventive services.&#13;
The average length of stay in short-stay hospitals also dropped by over 15 percent in the first two years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
after PPS introduction, significantly accelerating the downward trend begun earlier. The total days of&#13;
care per 1,000 PPS enrollees dropped dramatically--over 15 percent--by the end of the first full year of&#13;
the PPS program in 1984. FYR Macedonia has a far less efficient health system than the United States,&#13;
so that movement to payment mechanisms which transfer financial risk to providers and create incentives&#13;
for efficient behavior could be expected to have equal or greater impacts on fiscal outlays and cost-&#13;
effectiveness of care.&#13;
Enhance the Technical Skills of the NHIF and Hospital Administrators&#13;
14.    The status quo was deemed unacceptable. In order to implement the other elements of this&#13;
component, such as management information systems and policy reforms, skilled technical professionals&#13;
and hospital administrators are required. If these professionals do not have the skills to understand or&#13;
take advantage of the possibilities created in the other parts of the component, the objectives of the project&#13;
will not be met. Therefore, the status quo was rejected. There are many other combinations of training&#13;
which could also succeed, but the proposed program is reasonable and cost effective. The project is&#13;
flexible enough so that training components can be altered as needs evolve.&#13;
Component II: Basic Health Services&#13;
This component has three activities: 1) reforms in the organization of health services;&#13;
2) investments in rural primary health care centers; and 3) material support for disease prevention and&#13;
health promotion programs. All three of these activities directly contribute to improving the health of&#13;
the population by enhancing the quality of basic health services&#13;
Reforms in Organization of Health Services&#13;
15.    Supply-side investments under this component are linked to reforms to reinstate an appropriate&#13;
referral system, simplify the staffing structure for primary health care, redeploy staff to rural primary&#13;
care centers, reduce excess manpower and limit the future supply of medical professionals. Additional&#13;
policy reforms certainly could be proposed. But given limited resources, the political feasibility, and&#13;
likely impact to achieve program objectives, these policy reforms were mutually selected for attention by&#13;
the Government. These reforms address the inadequacy and inefficiency of the status quo, which is&#13;
characterized by: 1) underutilization of staff in public sector facilities; 2) duplication and fragmentation&#13;
in the provision of primary care services; 3) unemployment of graduating medical professionals; 4) lack&#13;
of basic equipment and staff for primawy care in rural areas, resulting in "self referral" to hospitals and&#13;
overreliance on high-cost nospital care.&#13;
Investment in Rural Primary Health Care Centers&#13;
16.   Investments under this component complement the overall demand-side approach taken to&#13;
stimulating appropriate primary care through development of a capitation payment mechanism (see&#13;
above). Stimulation of demand for primary care--and providing patient choice--are geared toward&#13;
increasing the quality of public seclor care and generaiing competition from private sector providers.&#13;
However, global experience demonstrates that in isolated rural areas, market incentives are insufficient&#13;
for private sector development, and will not lead to socially-desirable levels of health care for rural&#13;
populations, which tend to be poorer and more elderly than the general population. Therefore, most&#13;
governments--including in countries with highly privatized health care markets, such as the United States--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
offer special incentives and/or direct public sector provision of primary care in poor, rural areas. For&#13;
this reason, a purely demand-side approach to primary care in FYR Macedonia was rejected as an&#13;
alternative to the status quo. The project includes complementary supply-side investments to ensure&#13;
provision of quality primary health care, targeted to a limited number of rural areas where public sector&#13;
intervention will remain well-justified. These investments include basic equipment for 250 rural primary&#13;
health centers (e.g., stethoscopes, infant scales, blood pressure gauges) as well as support for a permanent&#13;
program of in-service training for primary care personnel, to update prevention and treatment algorithms.&#13;
Material Support for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Programs&#13;
17.    The alternatives to supporting disease prevention/health promotion programs which were&#13;
considered were the status quo and treatment--rather than prevention--of the associated diseases. The&#13;
status quo is characterized by less than 2 percent of health expenditures being devoted to disease&#13;
prevention programs, an amount which has declined by 35 percent in real terms since 1991. Under fiscal&#13;
pressure, FYR Macedonia's impressive history of nearly total childhood immunization coverage, has&#13;
given way to gaps in immunization coverage resulting in epidemics of infectious diseases. In 1992, for&#13;
example, measles immunization coverage fell to only 60 percent, followed by a 600 percent increase in&#13;
measles incidence in 1993-94. One-quarter of infant deaths are due to premature delivery and low birth&#13;
weight, while another quarter are due to easily preventable and treatable infectious diseases. The status&#13;
quo is clearly not contributing to project objectives to improve health status.&#13;
18.    The project team was unable to identify alternatives to supporting well-documented, cost-effective&#13;
interventions such as childhood immunization and prenatal care, as the best means to achieve&#13;
improvements in health status. The de facto alternative--treatment of the associated diseases--is clearly&#13;
less cost effective, involving, in most instances expensive drug therapy and/or hospital stays. The&#13;
programs selected, which target immunization, maternal and child health, tuberculosis prevention. AIDS&#13;
prevention, and safe blood supply are basic public health programs. It was recognized that intervention&#13;
in prevention of smoking would have been among the most cost-effective investments, but this was&#13;
deemed too controversial for an initial IDA project. Investment in female educational attainment is&#13;
another alternative which could impact on some of these areas--but is being addressed by Government&#13;
and other donors, as well as under another proposed IDA Credit (FY98).&#13;
Component III: Pharmaceutical Policy and Supply&#13;
19.    Authorization of private sector pharmaceutical activity in 1991 led to the rapid growth of private&#13;
pharmaceutical suppliers and distributors, in a largely unregulated environment. This was coupled with&#13;
continued public sector procurement of drugs for public sector health facilities and pharmacies.&#13;
Alternative project designs considered were maintaining the status quo and moving to a completely&#13;
privatized pharmaceutical market. The status quo is characterized by inefficiency in the private sector&#13;
due to well-documented market failures (monopoly/oligopoly situations, asymmetry of information,&#13;
imperfect information, etc.) associated with the pharmaceutical market, particularly a small market such&#13;
as in FYR Macedonia.  Inefficiency is also rampant in the public sector, where procurement is&#13;
fragmented and uncompetitive, and reimbursement policies encourage inappropriate prescribing and&#13;
dispensing practices. As a result, drug choice is limited (low-cost generic equivalents are unavailable)&#13;
and prices are exorbitant. For a small sample of tracer drugs (all of which were essential drugs), local&#13;
prices in the private market were 5 to 20 times higher than world market prices. Many essential drugs&#13;
are completely unavailable in rural areas. The status quo does nothing to achieve the project objective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 6&#13;
of making essential drugs broadly available to consumers at the lowest possible cost.&#13;
20.    The alternative of a totally private pharmaceutical market is one which no other country has&#13;
pursued. This is because an unfettered private pharmaceutical market--prone to the market failures&#13;
indicated above--would exacerbate rather than improve current inefficiencies, raising the cost for&#13;
consumers. The option of relying solely on regulation of the private sector was deemed inadequate for&#13;
the near future due to weak regulatory and enforcement capacity of the public sector. Although a well-&#13;
regulated private market could become competitive over time, it is clear that to achieve such a system&#13;
with real competition and extensive supply, would take many years. At this point in time, a weakly-&#13;
regulated private market system would lead to unnecessarily high prices, maldistribution of supply,&#13;
discrimination against the poor, inefficiency and suboptimal medical outcomes due to lack of appropriate&#13;
drug therapy. For this reason, the option of private sector regulation plus direct public sector intervention&#13;
was selected--in order to reduce barriers to market entry and create a more competitive private market&#13;
(through changes to registration, pricing and dispensing policies), as well as develop an efficient public&#13;
sector to compete directly with the private sector through supply of public sector health facilities and&#13;
pharmacies. Changes to procurement and reimbursement policies will increase efficiency in the public&#13;
sector. Indeed, a recent change to competitive bidding for local procurement has already resulted in an&#13;
average 35 percent reduction in the cost of the drugs procured by this method.&#13;

            The dual objectives of the Health Sector
            Transition Project are to: 1) improve the health of the
            population by enhancing the quality of basic health
            services; and 2) support an initial phase of policy reforms
            to increase cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and
            patient choice within the health system. These broad
            objectives will be achieved through activities and reforms
            under the following three project components: 1) health
            finance and management; 2) basic health services; and 3)
            pharmaceutical policy and supply. The specific objectives of
            these three components are as follows, respectively: 1) to
            build capacity to analyze and apply information for
            policy-making and health system management; 2) to strengthen
            primary health care and support high-priority disease
            prevention and health promotion programs; and 3) to reduce
            the cost of essential drugs by creating a more competitive
            pharmaceutical market.
