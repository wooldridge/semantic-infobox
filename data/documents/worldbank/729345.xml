        <abstracts>
            From 1990 to 1999 there were 700 energy
            projects in developing countries involving private
            participation. Investment in these projects totaled nearly
            US$190 billion, and foreign capital was a major source of
            funds. Global developers were the top ten sponsors of
            private energy projects in developing countries. Their
            projects accounted for just over a third of total
            investment. This Note surveys the trends by region, by
            country income level, and by type of project. It also
            explores the consequences of the recent Asian financial
            crisis for future investment in Asian energy markets.
