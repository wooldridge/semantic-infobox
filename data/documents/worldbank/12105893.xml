better able to exploit them by transferring their                                                                     Copyedited and produced by&#13;

            Tax incentives : using tax incentives to
            attract foreign direct investment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The increasing mobility of international
            firms and the gradual elimination of barriers to global
            capital flows have stimulated competition among governments
            to attract foreign direct investment, often through tax
            incentives. This note reviews the debate about the
            effectiveness of tax incentives, examining two
            much-contested questions: can tax incentives attract foreign
            investment? And what are the costs of using them?
