             By: William H. Becker &amp; Marie T. Zenni&#13;
&amp;#12;Dr, Becker:   Good morning, today is November 7th, 2001 and Iâ&#128;&#153;m Bill Becker with the Business&#13;
&#13;
              History Group and the George Washington University and weâ&#128;&#153;re here today to do a&#13;
&#13;
              retrospective on the evolution of technology at the World Bank with George W. West&#13;
&#13;
              and William McDonald Buck.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:    Iâ&#128;&#153;m Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Oral History program.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:     Iâ&#128;&#153;m George West.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:     And Iâ&#128;&#153;m William McDonald Buck [referred to herein as â&#128;&#156;Deeâ&#128;? by Mr. West].&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:   Weâ&#128;&#153;d like to begin by asking you briefly to talk about your background prior to joining&#13;
&#13;
              the Bank including the reasons or reason why you decided to leave the private sector&#13;
&#13;
              and join the Bank. Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:     I joined the Bank in 1972. Prior to that I had been a consultant working for the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
              Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s General Services Administration and also the head of a software&#13;
&#13;
              development firm located in northern Virginia. Previous to that I had been in the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
              Military and had briefly worked for General Electric prior to going into the U.S. Air&#13;
&#13;
              Force. I had been a resident of Washington as a result of having been stationed at the&#13;
&#13;
              Pentagon. I was living in Atlanta, Georgia when I interviewed for work at the World&#13;
&#13;
              Bank. My reasons for coming to the World Bank were one, the mission of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
              was something that was quite interesting to me. I had been in the private sector; I had&#13;
&#13;
              been in the software development industry. I did not know that much about the Bank&#13;
&#13;
              initially and I was moving from being in the mainstream of the computing business into&#13;
&#13;
              computing at the World Bank; computing was a secondary and support function within&#13;
&#13;
              the Bank so I did have some trepidation about that but the mission was a compelling&#13;
&#13;
              and I decided to give it a try.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:   Very good. Mr. Buck?&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid my reasons are a little more pedestrian. I left college in 1971 and went to&#13;
&#13;
                work for a computer manufacturer named Burroughs, who assigned me to the World&#13;
&#13;
                Bank. My association with the World Bank Information Technology begins in 1971&#13;
&#13;
                rather than 1974. In those days, computers were expensive and people were cheap.&#13;
&#13;
                Typically when you bought a multi-million dollar computer, you got two or three&#13;
&#13;
                people with it and I was one of those bodies that got assigned to the Bank. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
                was a difficult customer. It had already chewed up two or three people and spit them&#13;
&#13;
                out. Burroughs was desperate to find someone credible here. I was fortunate enough to&#13;
&#13;
                be credible. So after I was assigned here, for all practical purposes I worked directly for&#13;
&#13;
                the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s head of computing, who gave me my daily assignments to support Bank&#13;
&#13;
                work, However, my paycheck came from Burroughs. After three years, it became&#13;
&#13;
                increasingly obvious that I was doing work which the Bank wanted and that it would be&#13;
&#13;
                to my advantage to become an employee of the Bank, rather than an employee of&#13;
&#13;
                Burroughs. I made that transition. It was a little bit rocky because of the way the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                managed positions and hiring but after having made the transition I sat at the same desk&#13;
&#13;
                and did the same job; I just had a different paycheck.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     OK. For the record, could you please give us a brief outline of the positions you held at&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve already covered when you joined, but once you joined the Bank? Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       In October â&#128;&#153;72, I came to the Bank. The first position I held â&#128;&#147; and this may not be in&#13;
&#13;
                the personnel records â&#128;&#147; but the job title was User Representative, which was liaison&#13;
&#13;
                between the-then Computing Activities Department (CAD) and the Controllers&#13;
&#13;
                organization. I also had responsibilities for liaison with the Human Resources group&#13;
&#13;
                and a couple of other departments. I canâ&#128;&#153;t recall exactly what they were but essentially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;                it was a position that represented the Computing Activities Department with the user&#13;
&#13;
                community within the Bank in some specific areas. I believe it was in 1975 that I&#13;
&#13;
                became the Division Chief for the User Services Division and the next position that I&#13;
&#13;
                held I think was an Acting Assistant Director within the Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
                Department. Following that, I accepted a position in the South Asia Region of the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     That was â&#128;&#153;82?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       That was in 1982. In 1982 I then became the Program Coordinator for the South Asia&#13;
&#13;
                Region and in 1987 I became the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Resident Representative in Sri Lanka. I&#13;
&#13;
                returned to Headquarters in roughly 1989 and was a Systems Advisor in the Policy&#13;
&#13;
                Planning and Research area. I then became a Division Chief in the Program and&#13;
&#13;
                Budgeting Department in roughly 1990 â&#128;&#147; I think that was Budget Policy and Systems&#13;
&#13;
                Division. I then became a Senior Advisor to the Controller and that title then became&#13;
&#13;
                Senior Manager. I was responsible for trust funds, trust fund administration, financial&#13;
&#13;
                controls and financial information. In1996 I transferred to the Information Technology&#13;
&#13;
                Services Department, where I retired as Senior Manager in the Information Solutions&#13;
&#13;
                Group at the end of April of 2001.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     OK, thank you. Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       When I transferred to the Bank from Burroughs, I became a Systems Programmer,&#13;
&#13;
                although this may not be how the Bank classified this position. Today you would say a&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;kernel hackerâ&#128;?; in those days hacker was a good word. I stayed as a technical fellow&#13;
&#13;
                up through 1982, 1983. At one point I worked briefly for George, just before he left, in&#13;
&#13;
                the so-called Software Systems Division. In 1983, when IRMD (Information Resource&#13;
&#13;
                Management Department) was formed, I was assigned to the division responsible for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;                the Burroughs computers as opposed to the other computers. Subsequently the Division&#13;
&#13;
                Chief, Wally Erikson, left. I became the acting Division Chief and then the Division&#13;
&#13;
                Chief of the Burroughs Facility Center. This organization changed names several times&#13;
&#13;
                during the organizational shenanigans around IRMD and ITF (Information Technology&#13;
&#13;
                and Facilities Department). In the third incarnation of ITF my assignment was to lead&#13;
&#13;
                the effort to engineer the Enterprise Network. I was very much involved with networks&#13;
&#13;
                by that time and I wrote the seminal paper on the Enterprise Network. My group was&#13;
&#13;
                the source of many ideas about the Enterprise Network, so the-then director of ITF&#13;
&#13;
                assigned me as a Project Manager for that implementation. That continued until 1995&#13;
&#13;
                when â&#128;&#147; because of the troubles that occurred subsequent to the scandal over the main&#13;
&#13;
                complex rehabilitation â&#128;&#147; Hywel Davies [the-then director] was put on administrative&#13;
&#13;
                leave. Everything sponsored by him was called into question. This included the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network project which was subsequently put on hold for a year. I was re-&#13;
&#13;
                assigned to the Office of the Director of OBP, the Organization and Business Planning&#13;
&#13;
                Department, as a Technology Advisor to Business Process Reengineering. My task was&#13;
&#13;
                to re-assess the business processes associated with IT in particular, including&#13;
&#13;
                governance, which was one of the factors leading to the creation of the CIO (Chief&#13;
&#13;
                Information Officer) position. The Bank briefly considered the creation of a vice&#13;
&#13;
                presidency for Information. I was briefly assigned to that Vice Presidency, which never&#13;
&#13;
                materialized. The President and Sven Sandstrom decided that they would not, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
                create a CIO. Instead, they would appoint Mohamed Muhsin Director of ITS&#13;
&#13;
                (Information Technology Services). I was then re-assigned to be an Advisor in the&#13;
&#13;
                Office of the Director of ITS. Subsequently I became a manager of various line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;                functions â&#128;&#147; staff functions in ITS and subsequent departments, responsibility for policy&#13;
&#13;
                and strategy and architecture and the like.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     OK. Turning now to computing and the use of technology at the World Bank. Since&#13;
&#13;
                the main focus of this interview is to trace the evolution of technology at the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
                could you briefly cover the background as to when the Bank first acquired its&#13;
&#13;
                mainframes? Weâ&#128;&#153;ve heard a little bit about Burroughs, but can you also discuss IBM&#13;
&#13;
                and Digital Equipment Corporation computers and what their primary use was at the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank at that time?&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. West.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think Dee [i.e., Mr. Buck] has more of the details than I do on this but let me start.&#13;
&#13;
                When I came into the Bank in 1972, there was a Burroughs 5500 computer already in&#13;
&#13;
                operation. Prior to that there was actually punched card accounting equipment. Some&#13;
&#13;
                of that was still in use. Punched cards were the medium for data entry and in some&#13;
&#13;
                cases storage of information. The Burroughs equipment went through several&#13;
&#13;
                evolutions. Dee can speak to the specific models and the upgrades of this equipment.&#13;
&#13;
                The basic use of the applications was financial applications, largely accounting, which&#13;
&#13;
                had been on the punch card equipment, but also economic data analysis, I canâ&#128;&#153;t give&#13;
&#13;
                you too much beyond that but I know that there was fair amount of number crunching.&#13;
&#13;
                There was also a joint computer center shared by the Bank and the IMF (International&#13;
&#13;
                Monetary Fund) for batch mode processing. Large trays of cards came in; large stacks&#13;
&#13;
                of paper went out. Payroll was one of the typical applications used from the financial&#13;
&#13;
                side but also for keeping the accounts of the Bank. Dee, maybe you can add more to&#13;
&#13;
                this, which was the first generation of the very first mainframe usage.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s all perfectly accurate. As George said, prior to obtaining its first mainframe we&#13;
&#13;
                used punchcard equipment. We also rented time on a computer at the National Bureau&#13;
&#13;
                of Standards, which is now the National Institute of Science and Technology in&#13;
&#13;
                Gaithersburg, Maryland for some statistical applications. The first computer was&#13;
&#13;
                contracted for in early 1968. There was a bid process and in fact the initial selection of&#13;
&#13;
                a computer was Honeywell. In March 1968 the Manager of the Joint Computer facility,&#13;
&#13;
                Bill Frasier, W.D.S. Frasier, issued the very first data processing bulletin to announce&#13;
&#13;
                the selection of Honeywell. Negotiations subsequently broke down with Honeywell.&#13;
&#13;
                The Bank then had to select between two other vendors: IBM and Burroughs. The&#13;
&#13;
                Bank ultimately chose Burroughs. The first performance test of Burroughs equipment&#13;
&#13;
                occurred in December 1968. The Bank opened the doors for business in rooms under&#13;
&#13;
                the then A and D Buildings that were jointly together in 1969. As George said, we had&#13;
&#13;
                this large punch â&#128;&#147; card punch â&#128;&#147; organization that employed probably 25 people. For&#13;
&#13;
                historical reasons it may be useful to know a little something about this kind of&#13;
&#13;
                computer we had in those days.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This computer had a one megahertz clock speed. It had 256 thousand bytes of memory.&#13;
&#13;
                They werenâ&#128;&#153;t what we today call bytes: they were actually six bit characters instead&#13;
&#13;
                eight bit bytes but, so perhaps 192 thousand bytes, 256 thousand characters, a memory&#13;
&#13;
                access took four microseconds, the total amount of disc we had in the whole place was&#13;
&#13;
                50 megabytes. If you look at those numbers in each of these parameters, we would say&#13;
&#13;
                todayâ&#128;&#153;s modern desktop computer is on the order of 500 to 1,000 times more powerful&#13;
&#13;
                than this computer. Today, every desktop computers is 864 megahertz, which is 864&#13;
&#13;
                times faster than that. Today every desktop computer has 256 million bytes , which is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;                1,250 times more than that computer had. Today memory operates at five nanoseconds&#13;
&#13;
                for an access time. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s five and nine zeros. Which is 800 times faster than the&#13;
&#13;
                memory of that machine. Todayâ&#128;&#153;s desktop computer has 20 gigabytes of disc, which is&#13;
&#13;
                400 times as much as that Burroughs computer had. And whatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting to&#13;
&#13;
                remember is that that computer served the whole Bank. One of the main commodities&#13;
&#13;
                of computers in those days was magnetic tapes. We had 25,000 tapes.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       25,000, yes. In 1972, when I arrived at the Bank, one of my first tasks was to look at&#13;
&#13;
                the inventory of tapes. I designed the tape label that included an expiration date. Prior&#13;
&#13;
                to that all the tapes were kept forever so this was the first attempt at organizing a&#13;
&#13;
                retention schedule.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And what was the retention? Can you give us an example?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       It varied depending upon the application . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      . . . Or the information . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       . . . and the information. Transactions for a period of time might be kept for six months&#13;
&#13;
                or they might be kept for a year Some tapes were considered historical tapes that would&#13;
&#13;
                have an indefinite retention period but youâ&#128;&#153;d try to minimize that because very soon&#13;
&#13;
                youâ&#128;&#153;d run out of storage. One of my first accomplishments for the Bank was to manage&#13;
&#13;
                the inventory of information starting to accumulate in electronic form at that point.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We still have magnetic tapes stored. Of course one of the concerns is that these tapes&#13;
&#13;
                become unreadable after a period of time. In addition to those computer users&#13;
&#13;
                mentioned by George, two other big computer users were the so-called Economics&#13;
&#13;
                Department, which later became the Economics Complex, and the External Debt group&#13;
&#13;
                which in history became a division in the Bank, but in those days was a big deal. A&#13;
&#13;
                huge amount of our storage was consumed by trying to keep track of a big external debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    7&#13;
&amp;#12;                database. Payroll and personnel as George said and the accounting applications. An&#13;
&#13;
                important point to remember is electronic calculators were expensive and rare and not&#13;
&#13;
                programmable. And so calculations, which today we take for granted in simple two-&#13;
&#13;
                dimensional spreadsheets, required computers in those days. Rate-of-return&#13;
&#13;
                calculations, for example, were a big use of digital computers. Nowadays, you just&#13;
&#13;
                pound in a single formula on an Excel spreadsheet and do rate-of-return calculations but&#13;
&#13;
                we had big models that did a lot of rate-of-return calculations. The first version of&#13;
&#13;
                whatâ&#128;&#153;s called RMSM (Revised Minimum Standard Model) was built on this Burroughs&#13;
&#13;
                machine by Nick Carter and his group. This is the model for country economies.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     This leads into the next question of how would you describe the state of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                computing capabilities and sophistication when you joined the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me shift back and add one point that may be of interest. Dee mentioned the&#13;
&#13;
                accumulation of debt data, but it is also of interest that the Bank is a major data&#13;
&#13;
                consumer and also a primary collector of information and a disseminator of data that&#13;
&#13;
                doesnâ&#128;&#153;t exist or isnâ&#128;&#153;t collected by other bodies. The debt data, I think, is the prime&#13;
&#13;
                example of data that originates in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We use a lot of the main sources for publication in debt data. Commodities data is&#13;
&#13;
                another area in which we specialize,, whereas the IMF is highly regarded for its&#13;
&#13;
                financial statistics, such as government finance and direction of.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     You would emphasize debt and commodities data?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes. This was unique to the Bank. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the major point.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       In these early years and still, yes. Probably the economic and social data that we keep&#13;
&#13;
                in the economics complex is very rich and far beyond my understanding of what theyâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                keeping, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                      8&#13;
&amp;#12;Dr. Becker:     So, going back to this question of computer and computing capabilities and&#13;
&#13;
                sophistication when you joined the Bank, how would you describe that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       My impression is that the Bank was state of the art;. It had modern equipment, it had&#13;
&#13;
                staff to do programming on commercial types of applications, the accounting&#13;
&#13;
                applications, as well as the more sophisticated economic modeling. In 1972, this was&#13;
&#13;
                an organization that was current in my mind with regard to the state of computing at&#13;
&#13;
                that point in time and actually reasonably well staffed to handle the needs. As we go&#13;
&#13;
                on, the capability of a centralized department to support an organization gets eroded.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. Buck, would you like to add to that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, I agree with what George said. I think a seminal activity was in 1971 when Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                McNamara retained a very senior figure in computing, Dr. Mervin Muller from the&#13;
&#13;
                University of Wisconsin, to form the first Computing Activities Department (CAD).&#13;
&#13;
                This was originally called Department of Computing Activities (DCA) and not&#13;
&#13;
                Computing Activities Department until a year later, in 1972 when the Bank re-&#13;
&#13;
                organized. In any case, Merv Muller came and formed the Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
                Department. He hired a lot of people and increased the level of sophistication of the&#13;
&#13;
                programming staff quite a bit. I think a lot of credit goes to Mr. McNamara for&#13;
&#13;
                recognizing that this was very important for the Bank and for hiring someone of this&#13;
&#13;
                stature. I think as we go through history that what George says continues to be true.&#13;
&#13;
                The Bank was always well staffed with extremely bright people and has always had&#13;
&#13;
                enough money despite difficulties making the investments and agonizing over these.&#13;
&#13;
                By and large there was always an adequate amount of computing resources. Where we&#13;
&#13;
                were weak and where we have always been weak in computing and in the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
                general, I think, has to do with process discipline. We tend to rely on the brilliance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  9&#13;
&amp;#12;                the people to get things done, rather than having systematic approaches to getting things&#13;
&#13;
                done. And I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s plagued computing as it has plagued everything else in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This may be endemic to the Bank in general as opposed to just the Computing&#13;
&#13;
                Activities Department. In terms of talented staff, Merv Muller actually had a selection&#13;
&#13;
                process that involved a written test. Only those who scored in the top 10% were made a&#13;
&#13;
                job offer.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It was very counter-cultural for the Bank in those days but you had to pass the Wolf&#13;
&#13;
                test, the Wolf Brothers Test. The Wolf Brothers were two of Mervâ&#128;&#153;s graduate students&#13;
&#13;
                from Wisconsin who had developed this test â&#128;&#147; a programming aptitude test â&#128;&#147; very early&#13;
&#13;
                and you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get a job in CAD if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t pass the test or if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t score very&#13;
&#13;
                high.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Youâ&#128;&#153;ve touched on this question already but let me see if we can get some other&#13;
&#13;
                thoughts about it. In looking now at the 1970s as a whole as opposed to when you first&#13;
&#13;
                got to the Bank, talk a little more about the heaviest uses of the various applications&#13;
&#13;
                being developed in the Bank and the other question related to this is, how was this&#13;
&#13;
                handled organizationally, the users and the applications? Mr. West, do you want to&#13;
&#13;
                start?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Since all of the computer applications development was done by Analyst Programmers,&#13;
&#13;
                people with specific computer programming skills that the general Bank population did&#13;
&#13;
                not have, requests were made of the Computing Activities Department to develop&#13;
&#13;
                certain applications to meet the business needs. The Computer Priorities Committee&#13;
&#13;
                looked at the range of requests made by the CAO; I canâ&#128;&#153;t recall the time but I know it&#13;
&#13;
                existed in the â&#128;&#153;70s. Initially, this was not a formal process. The committee reviewed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 10&#13;
&amp;#12;                requests that came in at various points in time throughout the year. Based on this&#13;
&#13;
                review decisions were then made to allocate resources to these requests for the&#13;
&#13;
                development of an application. In certain cases, a number of the applications took a&#13;
&#13;
                year or more before they actually provided the end result or the capability requested. So&#13;
&#13;
                the Computer Priorities Committee, which involved Director-level individuals from a&#13;
&#13;
                variety of departments, including some of the areas that made requests, functioned to&#13;
&#13;
                help allocate scarce project resources. My recollection was that Jim Kearns was in&#13;
&#13;
                Organization Planning, I think.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Ultimately, it became OPD (Organization Planning Department).&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Jim chaired this committee, the Computer Priorities Committee, which met roughly&#13;
&#13;
                once a month to review new requests the progress of work and then made priority&#13;
&#13;
                allocations of a limited set of resources.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      What led to its formation?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Basically, there was no chargeback at that time. The resources were internal resources.&#13;
&#13;
                There was more demand than resources to accommodate the demand, especially as time&#13;
&#13;
                went on and people saw that computing could assist them in their business functions.&#13;
&#13;
                There was need for a body not headed by the Computing Activities Department to&#13;
&#13;
                assess what the institutional priorities were and to balance the competing requests for&#13;
&#13;
                support. The Computers Priorities Committee was not involved in the day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
                operations, but one of the operational tasks CAD faced during the course of the month&#13;
&#13;
                was to juggle the reviewing of some of these jobs based on their priorities/applications.&#13;
&#13;
                We were running, I believe, 24 hours a day even in 1972. Requests for a job or&#13;
&#13;
                application to be processed meant that operationally the Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;                Department had to weigh these things on a daily basis. Now certain applications, such&#13;
&#13;
                as payroll, accounting closings, some of the economic reports, had schedules.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It might be useful to know how the Computing Activities Department (CAD) was&#13;
&#13;
                organized and how it carried out the work. The Computing Activities Department was&#13;
&#13;
                organized interestingly along aspects of the way we approached problems. Two of the&#13;
&#13;
                divisions in CAD were called File Processing 1 and File Processing 2. They tended to&#13;
&#13;
                be focused on the kinds of applications, which lent themselves to textual processing and&#13;
&#13;
                were written in a language called COBOL. Another division called Analytical Services&#13;
&#13;
                focused on number crunching with models and analytics and tended to use FORTRAN.&#13;
&#13;
                The Users Services Division liaised with the customers. The User Services group tried&#13;
&#13;
                to ferret out exactly what the requirements were, to understand the interrelationship&#13;
&#13;
                among requirements and to mediate these disputes about there being far more work than&#13;
&#13;
                there was resources to actually carry out the work. Finally there was the Software&#13;
&#13;
                Systems Division, which I was part of. In those days the computers didnâ&#128;&#153;t really work&#13;
&#13;
                quite so well. It was a bit difficult to keep them running so you tended to assemble a&#13;
&#13;
                little band of wizards who focused on knowing exactly how the computer worked.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Troubleshooting perhaps?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, keep it running and then helping the programmers to exploit the technology, which&#13;
&#13;
                was very heavily modified by us.. The software provided by the vendor tended to have&#13;
&#13;
                lots of problems and bugs. We would try to fix them and make it work. Finally, there&#13;
&#13;
                was the last group, the Data Processing Services Division that actually ran the&#13;
&#13;
                computers. They had computer operators, they ran the twenty-four hour a day shifts,&#13;
&#13;
                they had the keypunch people, they managed the tape library, they did what scheduling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  12&#13;
&amp;#12;                we did, theyâ&#128;&#153;d take care of the output, those kinds of activities. Scheduling problems&#13;
&#13;
                arose because of an inadequate amount of resources to carry out all the work. Clearly&#13;
&#13;
                the Computing Activities Department did not want to be in the position of judging&#13;
&#13;
                whether it was more important to invest in additional accounting applications versus&#13;
&#13;
                additional HR applications versus statistical. This led us to our first attempt at&#13;
&#13;
                governance. Governance was a word we began to use in the early â&#128;&#153;80s. Of course the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank uses this word in its own right, but in terms of IT and the Bank weâ&#128;&#153;ve used this&#13;
&#13;
                word since the early â&#128;&#153;80s. My recollection is weâ&#128;&#153;ve had seven or eight different&#13;
&#13;
                governance mechanisms in place during the history of IT in the Bank. That in itself is a&#13;
&#13;
                very interesting evolution; that is the way IT has grappled with trying to put the&#13;
&#13;
                customers in charge of the deployment of resources.&#13;
&#13;
                For the moment, we ought not to forget that thereâ&#128;&#153;s a whole other body not yet&#13;
&#13;
                mentioned; which is the shared computer hardware resources with the IMF. Whereas&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank was centralized â&#128;&#147; it had centralized IT in â&#128;&#153;71 under the Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
                Department â&#128;&#147; the IMF was decentralized. The Bank had four principal users, the&#13;
&#13;
                Research Department, the Administration Department, the Bureau of Statistics, which&#13;
&#13;
                publishes their literature and the Treasury. Each of them had their own programming&#13;
&#13;
                organization, their own leadership. Each of them had their own ideas about how we&#13;
&#13;
                ought to invest our resources. Whereas the Bank under Merv Muller could say, â&#128;&#156;This is&#13;
&#13;
                what the Bank wants,â&#128;? the Fund was never able to reach agreement on what it wanted,&#13;
&#13;
                which contributed to this perception of the domination of the-then Joint Computer&#13;
&#13;
                Center by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Was this joint committee called the Bank-Fund Joint Computing Committee?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 13&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       No, it was not. There was a joint committee for the Library, but not one for the&#13;
&#13;
                Computer Center. This contributed to this perception that the IMF wasnâ&#128;&#153;t getting its&#13;
&#13;
                fair share. The Bank of course was a bigger organization, had more requirements, had&#13;
&#13;
                more money and had more people. But it was also centralized and very clear about&#13;
&#13;
                what it wanted, whereas the IMF had a harder time.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So that in fact gave it an advantage. The Bank had an advantage because it was&#13;
&#13;
                centralized and clear in its goals.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Turning to or following up on this discussion on the growth of computing activities in&#13;
&#13;
                the early â&#128;&#153;70s which coincided with great organizational changes and expansion of the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank itself under President Robert McNamara i.e. the 1972 re-organization. To what&#13;
&#13;
                extent did the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s computing capabilities enhance or hinder this expansion? Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Slightly difficult question. I think the Computing Activities Department expanded&#13;
&#13;
                along with the Bank. In terms of the demand for the services that grew because of an&#13;
&#13;
                increasing awareness by people of the benefits that computing could offer to them, one&#13;
&#13;
                of the applications development during the 1972 reorganization was an analysis of the&#13;
&#13;
                effects of the â&#128;&#153;72 reorganization. I think computing provided the Bank with an&#13;
&#13;
                additional set of capabilities for analytical work. A goal and mode of operation was&#13;
&#13;
                increased efficiency. It was relatively easy to do the mechanical kinds of computations&#13;
&#13;
                and processing previously done manually. So the types of applications being developed&#13;
&#13;
                on the analytical side included complex calculations, economic modeling, and&#13;
&#13;
                increasingly, rate-of-return kind of calculations. As the lending program grew, more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               14&#13;
&amp;#12;                and more rate-of-returns were required, computing made that calculation very easy and&#13;
&#13;
                multiple scenarios were examined.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Especially that Robert McNamara was a numbers man?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Robert McNamara was a numbers man. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure exactly when it occurred but one&#13;
&#13;
                of the things done internally within the Bank was the development of a spreadsheet&#13;
&#13;
                capability. This was prior to Lotus 1-2-3 and well prior to Excel. We brought in&#13;
&#13;
                Digital equipment â&#128;&#147; a UNIX-based processor â&#128;&#147; and one individual was assigned to&#13;
&#13;
                work with the-then Planning and Budgeting Department. The bulk of the work for that&#13;
&#13;
                individual was the generation/creation of spreadsheets. Once the capability to do basic&#13;
&#13;
                arithmetic on spreadsheets and in tables was developed, this was used by the Planning&#13;
&#13;
                and Budgeting Department to generate many of their tables and to handle the various&#13;
&#13;
                scenarios with regard to resource allocation and planning. That person left the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
                market the product.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And did well marketing it outside the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I believe so.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This is an interesting story. This fellow developed this product in his basement for the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank. This actually occurred near 1980, about the time when personal computers, the&#13;
&#13;
                CP/M version of computers, began to emerge. This young man left the Bank under the&#13;
&#13;
                agreement, I think, that he could take this product and market it but that the Bank would&#13;
&#13;
                never have to pay for it. He and his sister formed a company called T/Maker. This&#13;
&#13;
                company, T/Maker I think, still exists. Interestingly, his sister, Heidi Roizen, became&#13;
&#13;
                the head of the company and subsequently became the head of SPA (Software&#13;
&#13;
                Publishersâ&#128;&#153; Organization), which is very concerned about software piracy. Heidi&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                15&#13;
&amp;#12;                Roizen is constantly being interviewed on the Hill about the whole issue of software&#13;
&#13;
                piracy. We were all very interested in how Peter did when he left. Unfortunately,&#13;
&#13;
                T/Maker didnâ&#128;&#153;t really end up dominating this market because shortly thereafter came&#13;
&#13;
                Visicalc, the first commercially successful spreadsheet. And then Lotus 1-2-3,&#13;
&#13;
                QuattroPro and Excel.&#13;
&#13;
                I wanted to emphasize the importance of the coincidence of growth in computing&#13;
&#13;
                activities and growth in the Bank itself. Robert McNamara was a very different animal&#13;
&#13;
                than previous Presidents. The formation of the Programming and Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
                Department was a key event in shaping the way the Bank managed itself. The&#13;
&#13;
                application of analytical techniques to measure whether or not the Bank was effective&#13;
&#13;
                was a new idea. His focus on analytical techniques probably did have a big impact on&#13;
&#13;
                the way people in operational work thought about the application of computer&#13;
&#13;
                technology. Probably prior to that people thought computer technology did not lend&#13;
&#13;
                itself very well to analytical techniques. And yet in the â&#128;&#153;70s we had a surge of this.&#13;
&#13;
                Robert McNamara inspired analytical analysis of the pipeline and how we were doing&#13;
&#13;
                and that kind of stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Even though computing was viewed as a cost item?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Oh, absolutely, yes, absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think that also gets into the aspect of computing being used in the management sense&#13;
&#13;
                to plan and monitor as Dee has mentioned. One of the applications that I remember&#13;
&#13;
                being developed was the lending timetable, which was a computer application that&#13;
&#13;
                tracked the dates and the progress against the dates for lending projects. This included&#13;
&#13;
                key dates such as the appraisal date, the mission departure dates and the Board dates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 16&#13;
&amp;#12;                That became a computing application which involved a monthly update of the key dates&#13;
&#13;
                for all lending projects.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think this led to a lot of the organizational tension existing at that time. There was a&#13;
&#13;
                growing demand for computing applications, but these computers cost millions of&#13;
&#13;
                dollars. The Computing Activities Department had a relatively small budget compared&#13;
&#13;
                to the Bank. As a background function, this requirement to invest in more computing&#13;
&#13;
                was â&#128;&#147; it has always been â&#128;&#147; a problem.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Given the prevailing mind-set that computing and technology were backroom functions&#13;
&#13;
                rather than change enablers, what impact did this have on the growth of computing&#13;
&#13;
                activities?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The key tension here was that to the extent that CAD was constrained by inability to&#13;
&#13;
                compete for resources against operational programs, we werenâ&#128;&#153;t able to invest in more&#13;
&#13;
                computing equipment. This led to a growing dissatisfaction among the customer&#13;
&#13;
                communities who needed more computing capacity. It also led to the perception that&#13;
&#13;
                those guys (CAD) donâ&#128;&#153;t seem to be able to get the job done. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re a problem, theyâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                an obstacle and therefore we donâ&#128;&#153;t want to give them any more money. It was very&#13;
&#13;
                much of a self-fulfilling prophecy and that tension grew very sharp towards the end of&#13;
&#13;
                the â&#128;&#153;70s. Also at that point there was a shortage of resources; organizations around the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank unable to get their applications built. These organizations tended to go out and&#13;
&#13;
                hire their own consultants, i.e., programmers. This created a marketplace of consultants&#13;
&#13;
                building applications outside of CAD and creating even further requirements for&#13;
&#13;
                computing capacity. Remember also computing capacity was very lumpy. When you&#13;
&#13;
                start to run out of capacity, you need to make a big investment to buy the next box. The&#13;
&#13;
                Bank had no capital budget facility in those days. Everything was managed in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;                ordinary administrative budget. Hereâ&#128;&#153;s CAD running along at $5 million a year in total&#13;
&#13;
                budget resources and needs to make an investment of $10 million. It is very hard to do&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       We actually have two aspects here. One is that growth within the Bank during this&#13;
&#13;
                period was through positions and there was position control. Your budget grew as a&#13;
&#13;
                result of the number of positions that you had and there was competition with&#13;
&#13;
                operational programs for positions. The scales were not balanced here. Operations won&#13;
&#13;
                out. As long as the Bank continued to grow computing, CAD got a small increment in&#13;
&#13;
                terms of authorized positions. But it was nowhere near sufficient to meet the demand&#13;
&#13;
                for programmer analysts and individuals who had skills to develop the applications.&#13;
&#13;
                Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure of the timing but it may have been slightly before the hand-held&#13;
&#13;
                programmable calculator appeared. The hand-held programmable calculator was a&#13;
&#13;
                device that a number of operational staff started using to do various calculations.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It was probably about â&#128;&#153;81. There was an aspect of this position control which came&#13;
&#13;
                back to haunt us years later. CAD was unable to get positions in competition in the&#13;
&#13;
                budget process with the Bank. Positions went to the front line operational units, of&#13;
&#13;
                course, as is appropriate. But CAD resorted to all manner of bizarre techniques to get&#13;
&#13;
                staff on board. One of those techniques that I personally came to rue very much later on&#13;
&#13;
                was the concern in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s HR management that there werenâ&#128;&#153;t career paths for&#13;
&#13;
                people in lower paying jobs. Attention was focused on the possibility of computing&#13;
&#13;
                being an area in which people who had jobs in say the messenger area could aspire to&#13;
&#13;
                move into a higher growth area. A deal was arranged so that CAD could get&#13;
&#13;
                sponsorship from the HR organization for additional positions if we could arrange a&#13;
&#13;
                career path for people such as the messenger area. Since this was the only way we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 18&#13;
&amp;#12;                could get people, we accepted this. Well, the problem was that we got people who&#13;
&#13;
                probably did not have the skills. We thought we could train them and we tried and&#13;
&#13;
                some of them subsequently learned very well . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Were trainable?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       And many were not. This was only resolved by the 1987 reorganization for we ended&#13;
&#13;
                up carrying a lot of people that we had brought on, some of whom really couldnâ&#128;&#153;t make&#13;
&#13;
                the transition.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Someone who was a messenger or something like that became a computer operator.&#13;
&#13;
                The transition from computer operator to a programmer was a much bigger chasm to&#13;
&#13;
                cross; this required the analytical capabilities demonstrated in Merv Mullerâ&#128;&#153;s tests,&#13;
&#13;
                which existed up until 1982. I think we only had two people who made the transition&#13;
&#13;
                from computer operator to programmer. One of them continued as a programmer right&#13;
&#13;
                up until â&#128;&#153;87, Iâ&#128;&#153;d say, maybe even later.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to turn a little bit now to the transition from computing to the advent of office&#13;
&#13;
                technology. I would like to first talk a little bit about that transition. Was it something&#13;
&#13;
                that you were aware of at the time?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       When we talk in terms of office technology, we havenâ&#128;&#153;t talked about the advent of word&#13;
&#13;
                processing at the Bank, which came as a centrally controlled facility. It started in the&#13;
&#13;
                Administrative Services Department with a central pool of word processors. You have&#13;
&#13;
                hardware designed just to do word processing, which was the precursor to eventually&#13;
&#13;
                having computers on each desk.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And this would be mid-to-late â&#128;&#153;70s that the . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was early, earlyâ&#128;&#153;80s. This was not a centralized computing facility nor was it&#13;
&#13;
                viewed as a computing facility . It was viewed as word-processing something done by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;                an organizational unit. When prices decreased and the capabilities of this equipment&#13;
&#13;
                were recognized, organizational units started to select their own brand of word&#13;
&#13;
                processing equipment. We had Wang, Micom, UNIX and NBI. There were probably&#13;
&#13;
                some eight or nine different versions of word processing operating in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       DisplayWrite.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, IBMâ&#128;&#153;s DisplayWrite. The beginning of office technology from a word processing&#13;
&#13;
                standpoint was on a pool basis.. Jobs come in for typing, went through the pool and&#13;
&#13;
                came out again. Coincident with this, we have people discovering PCs. And I think&#13;
&#13;
                this was early â&#128;&#153;80s when it starts to hit the Bank. Individuals are starting to buy PCs on&#13;
&#13;
                their own and starting then to make requests that budget resources be used to purchase&#13;
&#13;
                PCs.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What then is the implication of that for requirements, standards? Mr. Buck? You both&#13;
&#13;
                smiled broadly.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Oh yes, itâ&#128;&#153;s such a broad subject. I want to elaborate on a couple points mentioned by&#13;
&#13;
                George. First itâ&#128;&#153;s important to remember that the central word processing organization&#13;
&#13;
                was part of ADM (Administrative Services Department), not part of IRMD. It was an&#13;
&#13;
                entirely different organization and, incidentally, it will be important later. ADM was&#13;
&#13;
                also responsible for telephones as well as for printing and graphics as they still are.&#13;
&#13;
                There was an organizational alignment issue here. Second, I want to emphasize that&#13;
&#13;
                today we use the words IT (Information Technology) and OT (Office Technology)&#13;
&#13;
                almost interchangeably. People forget how much difference there was between these&#13;
&#13;
                things in the early â&#128;&#153;80s. They both used electronic equipment but there was a huge&#13;
&#13;
                chasm between them. I remember in the early â&#128;&#153;80s people wanting to get documents or&#13;
&#13;
                information from the mainframe computers onto the Wang. There was no way as we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  20&#13;
&amp;#12;                had no capacity to do that. All the way through the â&#128;&#153;80s and into the early â&#128;&#153;90â&#128;&#153;s one of&#13;
&#13;
                our major challenges was trying to integrate IT and OT. In the â&#128;&#153;80s people talked about&#13;
&#13;
                how to do micro-to-mainframe connections. How to do file transfers between PCs and&#13;
&#13;
                mainframes. How to get information from one place to another. I believe that one of&#13;
&#13;
                the major geneses of this later idea of the Enterprise Network was precisely this&#13;
&#13;
                inability to connect the local equipment being used for office functions with the&#13;
&#13;
                institutional equipments being used for analytical work and data management. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                important to recognize that at the very beginning of office technology that IT became a&#13;
&#13;
                separate thing and when it came the PC became a part of the OT world, not a part of the&#13;
&#13;
                IT world.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     How did the Bank establish requirements or standards?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Initially it didnâ&#128;&#153;t. If you look at the history of the PC, the reason the PC actually took&#13;
&#13;
                off was the development of a software package called Visicalc and this was on, I think,&#13;
&#13;
                the TRS-80, the first machine. Radio Shack.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It was a Radio Shack computer.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Prior to that this, it was a techie kind of thing. People built their own computers from&#13;
&#13;
                components. Ataris and a bunch of others.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Commodores, Ataris, Amigas.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       People with this Visicalc program had the ability to manipulate tables and to do numeric&#13;
&#13;
                calculations in an extremely easy fashion. This was the T/Maker, the commercial&#13;
&#13;
                version that got the market penetration. You bought the computer to be able to do the&#13;
&#13;
                manipulations on tables, which made the personal computer attractive to professionals.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This was when the word â&#128;&#156;killer appâ&#128;? was developed. Visicalc was the first killer app.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Killer app. This is what caused you to sell hardware.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      How did these happenings in the Bank compare with other organizations?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Same thing.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This is a phenomenon that occurred basically within the U.S. economy. The U.S.&#13;
&#13;
                economy led in the development of computers so this was something that was&#13;
&#13;
                happening in the U.S. and we had staff within the Bank who had their connections with&#13;
&#13;
                universities and to the outside private sector who said, â&#128;&#156;We can use these.â&#128;? The&#13;
&#13;
                government was the leader in the big machine stuff. The personal computer market, I&#13;
&#13;
                believe, this Visicalc and Radio Shack, Tandy kind of equipment was what people&#13;
&#13;
                started to see. Think about this. From 1980 to 1983, personal computers,&#13;
&#13;
                microcomputers were a hobbyist phenomenon until the time of Visicalc.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what I wanted to ask you. This is something that the technical staff was&#13;
&#13;
                interested in first or became aware of first because well, they werenâ&#128;&#153;t hobbyists?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Interestingly, I am a fierce technologist, always have been. I was not interested in&#13;
&#13;
                microcomputers. I thought these were toys. I had a $10 million computer I could play&#13;
&#13;
                with that had a well-formed operating system&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So the professionals were interested in the big machines.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       For people who didnâ&#128;&#153;t have access to these computers, who could only stand in line and&#13;
&#13;
                punchcards, here was an opportunity to get your own computer, build one and really&#13;
&#13;
                understand it. And so the hobbyist and the hackers â&#128;&#147; hackers in a good sense â&#128;&#147; were the&#13;
&#13;
                ones who got into this. But youâ&#128;&#153;re right, they were mostly people with a technical bent.,&#13;
&#13;
                up until the time of Visicalc. Visicalc caused this enormous spike in the sales of&#13;
&#13;
                personal computers.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     In 1981 or â&#128;&#153;82?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                22&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       I would say â&#128;&#153;83, probably, before Visicalc. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure, exactly. The IBM PC was&#13;
&#13;
                introduced in â&#128;&#153;84. IBM, in a way, legitimatized the personal computer marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
                Because before that, people were buying computers from dozens of little niche&#13;
&#13;
                manufacturers,â&#128;&#147; Sinclair, Commodore, Amiga, Atari and Radio Shack â&#128;&#147; and everybody&#13;
&#13;
                had a different computer. There were only two or three main chips that were at the&#13;
&#13;
                heart of them. One was manufactured by a little company in Santa Clara, California&#13;
&#13;
                called Intel that nobody had ever heard of. [Laughs] They had the 8086 chip and&#13;
&#13;
                Motorola had the Z80 chip. Or no, they had the 68,000 chip. There are all these people&#13;
&#13;
                building these things when IBM entered that marketplace in 1984.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      So when did the personal computer first appear in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Some personal computers came into the Bank in â&#128;&#153;82 and â&#128;&#153;83 but they were, again, one-&#13;
&#13;
                off things. People were experimenting to see whether this had relevance trying to do&#13;
&#13;
                spreadsheets with them. But it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until â&#128;&#153;84 that they became a big thing.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What were the issues, then, with requirements and standards around this time? Right&#13;
&#13;
                before the IBM is introduced and then when the IBM is introduced? Did the Bank set a&#13;
&#13;
                standard that people buying personal computers or PCs have to buy IBMs?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No, not at that stage.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       In fact, we had early stages of the Apple wars, if you will, the religious wars about&#13;
&#13;
                whether the MAC or PC was better. At this early stage we were grappling with what to&#13;
&#13;
                do. The Bank always takes awhile to figure out how to react to one of these&#13;
&#13;
                standardization dilemmas. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until â&#128;&#153;85 that we established a standard. I think&#13;
&#13;
                that happened because these were one-off purchases and in relatively small numbers.&#13;
&#13;
                We did not face an organized program to equip an entire unit until later . Prior to that,&#13;
&#13;
                these were justified as specialized applications. I could use a PC or a Macintosh,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 23&#13;
&amp;#12;                whatever you preferred, to do a certain kind of calculation in a much more efficient&#13;
&#13;
                fashion than I could do any other way. And that was the justification for the purchase&#13;
&#13;
                and the bringing the PC in.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     How was this coordinated and budgeted for within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       These were purchased out of unit budgets. The same kinds of things that have occurred&#13;
&#13;
                over time; someone would downgrade a first-class trip to a business or economy and&#13;
&#13;
                use the savings to purchase a PC. It came out of discretionary resources that the units&#13;
&#13;
                had. So from a control standpoint this was a local application used to serve a local or&#13;
&#13;
                departmental business ness. This was not an institutional application.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       And bear in mind itâ&#128;&#153;s OT, not IT. Itâ&#128;&#153;s also local and uncontrolled. There is no budget&#13;
&#13;
                process for it and yet it comes to be the dominant factor over a period of years. I have a&#13;
&#13;
                chart which depicts the growth of computing capacity in the Bank from 1968 on&#13;
&#13;
                through somewhere in the 90s when I stopped charting this growth It shows this little&#13;
&#13;
                peak, this little growth curve, sort of exponential as we add computing capacity up&#13;
&#13;
                through say like â&#128;&#153;88 or â&#128;&#153;87 or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       No, this is the growth of the mainframe kind of capacity. The institutional computing&#13;
&#13;
                capacity from a MIP standpoint or . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       So hereâ&#128;&#153;s a growth curve like this. And superimposed on that is the growth curve of PC&#13;
&#13;
                computing capacity, which is almost vertical. Within the space of less than a year it&#13;
&#13;
                exceeded all the total capacity of our mainframe. But the aggregate investment in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank, the amount of money involved, the amount of staff time, the amount of support&#13;
&#13;
                requirement, everything shifts on a dime within a period of about 18 months from being&#13;
&#13;
                entirely mainframe-focused to being entirely focused on how we manage this avalanche&#13;
&#13;
                of personal computers coming in ? This is largely a local office phenomenon, not a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                24&#13;
&amp;#12;                central phenomenon. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a huge amount of money and a huge amount of capacity. It&#13;
&#13;
                generates a huge demand for support from the central organization. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no revenue&#13;
&#13;
                stream, no money, no control, no standardization, any organizational culture trying to&#13;
&#13;
                manage it.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     When is it clear that organizational changes came about to cope with or to get a handle&#13;
&#13;
                on this?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think it was clear very quickly but it took until, I think, two years ago [Laughs] But&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re still doing it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       But I think to attempt to answer we need to go to the first bank-endorsed PC, which to&#13;
&#13;
                my recollection was the Turbo XT?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No, itâ&#128;&#153;s something called the April Decisions in 1985 where we anointed the IBM PC.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       OK. So in April of â&#128;&#153;85 the Bank does say that the standard PC for the Bank is basically&#13;
&#13;
                IBM.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We should start a step earlier than that with the formation of IRMD. At the end of â&#128;&#153;82,&#13;
&#13;
                tensions had reached a point where Merv Muller and the Bank parted company. Mel&#13;
&#13;
                Ray, recruited from Duke University, was hired as the Director of IRMD. . In those&#13;
&#13;
                days, there were a handful of different ways that a new IT head in an organization&#13;
&#13;
                would try to put things in order. One was to develop a strategy, which was Melâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                preferred technique, so the IRM strategy process was launched in â&#128;&#152;82.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Weâ&#128;&#153;re talking information resource management?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Information Resource Management.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The process was called the Strategic Planning Process. It consisted of two phases later&#13;
&#13;
                combined.. The first was called the Information Systems Plan, the ISP, and the other&#13;
&#13;
                was called the Office Technology Systems, Office Systems Plan, OSP. Two different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 25&#13;
&amp;#12;                groups. Remember, IT and OT are different things. OSP and ISP were put together to&#13;
&#13;
                form the IRM strategy, The IRM strategy called for a multi-year investment in&#13;
&#13;
                standardizing all applications, databases, technology. It was a pretty broad vision, in&#13;
&#13;
                retrospect. It started in â&#128;&#153;82, and was finished say November of â&#128;&#153;83. at which point Mel&#13;
&#13;
                Ray tried to sell it to the Bank. As the developer, he canvased the Bank and said, â&#128;&#156;we&#13;
&#13;
                need to have a strategy,â&#128;? and everybody said, â&#128;&#156;yes, yes, itâ&#128;&#153;s a good idea.â&#128;? Mel Ray tried&#13;
&#13;
                to sell this to the Board and to senior management. It involved a lot of money, Mel&#13;
&#13;
                Rayâ&#128;&#153;s inability to get total Bank-wide support for implementation of the strategy is&#13;
&#13;
                probably the reason Mel Ray ultimately left. But, the IRM strategy produced a vision&#13;
&#13;
                of a set of projects that had to be done in order to create this vision. The initial set, the&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;launch packageâ&#128;?, included some 17 or so projects and was launched in, say, the spring&#13;
&#13;
                of â&#128;&#153;84. It accomplished several things. One of them was the personal computer project,&#13;
&#13;
                which built this massive test bay in the M Building on K Street and invited Bank staff to&#13;
&#13;
                actually try out all these different personal computers so that we could pick the best&#13;
&#13;
                personal computer. It may be overkill in retrospect; we ended up picking the IBM PC.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How was computing technology impacting the corporate culture of this institution, and,&#13;
&#13;
                in light of that, was there a growing awareness and recognition of the value of&#13;
&#13;
                communication and using information as a resource which had an impact on adopting&#13;
&#13;
                the IRM strategy concept? How does the corporate culture come into that, and what&#13;
&#13;
                impact does it have on all this?&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Dee has discussed the development of a methodology and approach to computing&#13;
&#13;
                technology information within an organization. This was born in the technology part of&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank. There was a little bit of what I would call tissue rejection of this concept&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    26&#13;
&amp;#12;                because basically the Bank has always considered itself to be a development&#13;
&#13;
                organization with two primary services. One is financial services, which are loans and&#13;
&#13;
                credits; the other is advisory services. The idea that the Bank is in the information&#13;
&#13;
                business is something still evolving. The core of what we deal with is information,&#13;
&#13;
                which when technology assists you, it is enabling. The corporate culture for adopting&#13;
&#13;
                this concept was not in place when they saw some additional costs for this computing.&#13;
&#13;
                But it was a cost that had some benefits associated with it. From a corporate standpoint&#13;
&#13;
                they could see that the office technology made it easier to create and revise reports. The&#13;
&#13;
                new technology also changed relationships between so-called support staff and the&#13;
&#13;
                professional staff. Some professional staff had PCs and actually did their own typing.&#13;
&#13;
                There was a whole set of forces in play that organizationally, senior management was&#13;
&#13;
                not totally aware of.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Certainly in the â&#128;&#153;80s?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Certainly in the â&#128;&#153;80s. The attempt to have the Bank adopt this information systems&#13;
&#13;
                plan, the IRM strategy, was a bold step. But you would have been running the&#13;
&#13;
                organization from an information standpoint and the organization was not ready for&#13;
&#13;
                that. At least in my view.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think that same set of tensions play out over and over again, throughout the â&#128;&#153;80s and&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#153;90s. I would characterize it this way: The Bank wants more technology support to be&#13;
&#13;
                available to carry out operational work but they want it to be done quickly and quietly&#13;
&#13;
                and effectively in the backroom and they donâ&#128;&#153;t want to think about it. An important&#13;
&#13;
                thing to remember is that while the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s culture itself is evolving, the nature of&#13;
&#13;
                computing is evolving as well. Computing was a backroom function that was done on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 27&#13;
&amp;#12;                central big mainframes that cost a lot of money. In the â&#128;&#153;70s nobody but the central&#13;
&#13;
                people and the few people that had to have applications thought about computing.&#13;
&#13;
                Whereas in the mid-â&#128;&#153;80s computing evolved into a local phenomenon instead of a&#13;
&#13;
                central phenomenon and became a departmental issue. In the â&#128;&#153;80s local division&#13;
&#13;
                managers now had to think about it because it was an office phenomenon and important&#13;
&#13;
                to the way we did our local work. But it still wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a senior management issue.&#13;
&#13;
                What Mel Ray was trying to do within our own strategy was to say, â&#128;&#156;Information is a&#13;
&#13;
                corporate issue that you need to think about. And for us to do a good job of solving the&#13;
&#13;
                issues that are beginning to erupt around the huge amounts of resources and the huge&#13;
&#13;
                numbers of computers involved in the local area, we have to have a corporate strategy&#13;
&#13;
                for this, we have to approach it as a corporate issue.â&#128;? Senior managers were still not&#13;
&#13;
                ready to think about this because it was a local departmental issue. The third phase&#13;
&#13;
                came in the â&#128;&#153;90s where IT became not a local issue but a corporate strategy issue, across&#13;
&#13;
                the whole United States, at least, the Western world and the Northern world. It became&#13;
&#13;
                a matter of positioning the corporation, so senior managers suddenly had to wake up&#13;
&#13;
                and pay attention. But during the â&#128;&#153;80s we were still in the second phase. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very&#13;
&#13;
                interesting to note that the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s organizational or cultural approach is always a step&#13;
&#13;
                behind as these phases change. At the end of the â&#128;&#153;70s and early beginnings of the â&#128;&#153;80s&#13;
&#13;
                we implemented mechanisms and finally processes to try to control computing. We&#13;
&#13;
                implemented the central mainframe organization chargeback one year before the world&#13;
&#13;
                totally changed as well as departmental computing. Chargeback was not a particularly&#13;
&#13;
                useful model. Throughout the â&#128;&#153;80s we grappled with, â&#128;&#156;How do we address the&#13;
&#13;
                problems of managing technology which is purchased locally with local budgets and&#13;
&#13;
                managed locally with local decisions? How do we apply chargeback in that arena in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                28&#13;
&amp;#12;                such a way where we will have the resources to manage this effectively?â&#128;? We just&#13;
&#13;
                about got that figured out in the early â&#128;&#153;90s when the whole nature of things changed&#13;
&#13;
                again and computing became a corporate issue. Now the Bank struggled with issues&#13;
&#13;
                like, â&#128;&#156;how are we going to make global decisions about, for example, investments in&#13;
&#13;
                satellite technology that lay a footprint over a whole half of the earth. How can we&#13;
&#13;
                apply the chargeback mechanisms put in place to manage mainframes to make decisions&#13;
&#13;
                corporately about whether weâ&#128;&#153;re going to invest in this kind of thing?â&#128;? Hereâ&#128;&#153;s a central&#13;
&#13;
                organization knocking on doors saying - let me take document management as a current&#13;
&#13;
                example; we have to invest in managing the documents of the Bank. We have to ask&#13;
&#13;
                people to pay for this out of their local budgets as if it were computer cycles. That&#13;
&#13;
                model doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work. The Bank has to make a decision corporately, which means itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                important to manage our information in order to carry out our work and then the&#13;
&#13;
                decisions have to flow down.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Whatâ&#128;&#153;s driving this relationship between the Bank and technology? Is it the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                strategy or is it advances in technology? I think youâ&#128;&#153;ve answered that from what&#13;
&#13;
                youâ&#128;&#153;ve been saying. What about the arrival of network technology in the late â&#128;&#153;80s and&#13;
&#13;
                early â&#128;&#153;90s? Is that what drives it up to the top? What is your assessment of the&#13;
&#13;
                recommendations of the IRM concept and strategy? Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The IRM concept was the precept that local line managers were responsible for&#13;
&#13;
                information resources as well as their budgetary resources and information and staff&#13;
&#13;
                resources. It reflected the period in which we had moved both organizationally and in&#13;
&#13;
                the computer business and budgetarily into a time of a lot of local control. The IRM&#13;
&#13;
                concept was the right idea for that time. On the other hand, regarding the IRM strategy&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#147; the idea that we would develop a corporate strategy for information â&#128;&#147; I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 29&#13;
&amp;#12;                already said I very much supported the idea that we ought to have had this. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                know that we ever effectively had it, in part â&#128;&#147; because in my own opinion and other&#13;
&#13;
                people may differ â&#128;&#147; I donâ&#128;&#153;t believe that the Bank has a business strategy. Consequently,&#13;
&#13;
                itâ&#128;&#153;s very hard to have an IRM strategy that is driven from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business strategy&#13;
&#13;
                but perhaps Iâ&#128;&#153;m not the one most qualified to talk about the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business strategy.&#13;
&#13;
                During the launching package we selected a number of different products. In April of&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#153;85 we decided on what were called the April Decisions, which included five different&#13;
&#13;
                technological standards picked at that time. The adoption of the IBM PC, a wiring&#13;
&#13;
                topology based on star-wired twisted pair. IBM Token Ring â&#128;&#147; actually it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t IBM, it&#13;
&#13;
                was Token Ring, based on Proteon cards, Banyan Vines for local area network services&#13;
&#13;
                and Digitalâ&#128;&#153;s All-In-One for an office system. Now remember All-In-One was selected&#13;
&#13;
                as an office system, not as a mail system, because we planned to do word processing. A&#13;
&#13;
                great strength of All-In-One was that you could in fact do that. And in fact the first&#13;
&#13;
                office system, the application, that you could slot into All-In-One to do word processing&#13;
&#13;
                with was something called Mass11 which was able to be integrated directly into All-In-&#13;
&#13;
                One.&#13;
&#13;
                Each of these five areas was chosen by a group operating under this launching package&#13;
&#13;
                that was focused on selecting best of breed. I canâ&#128;&#153;t resist saying that this is something&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank does over and over and over again. It takes extremely smart people and gives&#13;
&#13;
                them the challenge of picking the best product. We pick the best product, even though&#13;
&#13;
                it may not be in the context of the marketplace and in overall context it may not be the&#13;
&#13;
                choice thatâ&#128;&#153;s most appropriate for the Bank in the long run, but technologically, itâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
&#13;
                best thing. I would point at Burroughs which, in my mind, still had the best operating&#13;
&#13;
                system, but which totally lost out in the marketplace to IBM. The Bank found itself&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 30&#13;
&amp;#12;                saddled with this technology, which was technologically the best, but in the marketplace&#13;
&#13;
                was not where you wanted to be. We did the same thing over and over again with other&#13;
&#13;
                choices. The Banyan Vines that weâ&#128;&#153;ll talk about later was a far better local area&#13;
&#13;
                network implementation then Novell, but it lost out in the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
                What is interesting is these things were wholly incompatible with one another. Totally&#13;
&#13;
                incompatible. Digitalâ&#128;&#153;s All-In-One system was based on Ethernet. These were many&#13;
&#13;
                computers, they ran on Ethernet, you had to connect the terminals â&#128;&#147; there was a&#13;
&#13;
                terminal-based system, not a PC-based system. And so, the terminals were supposed to&#13;
&#13;
                be connected to these boxes that sat on Ethernet along with the big boxes â&#128;&#147; the VAXes&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#147; that had the All-In-One system. The only way you could connect a PC to it is by&#13;
&#13;
                running a piece of software that emulated a digital terminal and attaching it to one of&#13;
&#13;
                these terminal servers. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t under any circumstance use Token Ring to talk to&#13;
&#13;
                All-In-One. No All-In-One box, no Digital VAX anywhere in the world could be put&#13;
&#13;
                onto a Token Ring. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do it! Token Ring was superior technology. Here&#13;
&#13;
                again we picked the best technology. It was superior in many ways. In almost any way&#13;
&#13;
                you could name in 1985 it was superior to Ethernet and yet, All-In-One would only&#13;
&#13;
                work with Ethernet. Banyan Vines and Digital were anathema to each other. You&#13;
&#13;
                couldnâ&#128;&#153;t make them talk to each other nor was there anything you could do to make&#13;
&#13;
                them talk to each other! And so we picked these set of technologies that dogged us for&#13;
&#13;
                years afterwards; we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t make them work together. In different parts of the&#13;
&#13;
                organization, people went off with one subset of this, trying to drum up business within&#13;
&#13;
                the customer community. There grew up a great following in the Bank among some&#13;
&#13;
                subset of the organizational units for Digital technology. We started with All-In-One,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                31&#13;
&amp;#12;                we bought some VAXes for some other reasons and some parts of the Bank, in&#13;
&#13;
                particular in the Finance complex and Treasury started to use Digital hardware.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     How was the decision made for All-In-One?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The launching package project team went after a personal computer. They set up this&#13;
&#13;
                laboratory up in the M Building to evaluate everything. And of course while we were&#13;
&#13;
                in the middle of doing this, Apple introduced the Macintosh. Clearly this is one of the&#13;
&#13;
                cases in which the Bank resisted the temptation for jumping on the technologically most&#13;
&#13;
                sophisticated and interesting product. The Bank adopted the IBM PC but with a special&#13;
&#13;
                proviso even in the decision that the Apple Macintosh was really cool and that we were&#13;
&#13;
                going to use it in targeted specific locations on an experimental basis, or something like&#13;
&#13;
                that. We left the door open for the Apple Macintosh right from the beginning although&#13;
&#13;
                we selected the IBM. That came back to haunt us. This religious battle between the&#13;
&#13;
                forces of Macintosh and the forces of IBM was still going on in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
                There was also the wiring topology. Topologically, it was star-wired. The idea here&#13;
&#13;
                was that you connected every office to a wiring closet on a floor and then within that&#13;
&#13;
                wiring closet you did whatever you had to do in order to connect and we pre-wired all&#13;
&#13;
                the offices. This idea, the home run back to the wiring closet, is one of the few of any&#13;
&#13;
                of these things that have lasted. But the other part of it didnâ&#128;&#153;t last. The actual wire that&#13;
&#13;
                we wanted to pull into the offices and all the connectors that we put into the offices, all&#13;
&#13;
                of that ended up being eliminated in the long run. We picked something called shielded&#13;
&#13;
                twisted pair which nobody does anymore and nor do we do it anymore. We use&#13;
&#13;
                unshielded twisted pair like everybody else in the world now. Token Ring at the media&#13;
&#13;
                access layer: we bought Token Ring cards from a company called Proteon. We decided&#13;
&#13;
                they were pretty good. They eventually went out of business. At that time Ethernet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   32&#13;
&amp;#12;                could not be run in this star-wired way; it could only run office-to-office. You had to&#13;
&#13;
                run it up over the ceiling and down to office-to-office and if a computer stopped&#13;
&#13;
                working and then all the ones downstream stopped working and Ethernet was not a&#13;
&#13;
                good choice in â&#128;&#153;85. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until a couple of years later that a different mechanism&#13;
&#13;
                was invented for doing Ethernet and we began to move to it. So this wasnâ&#128;&#153;t such a bad&#13;
&#13;
                decision. Token Ring was superior but the truth was that Token Ring was overkill for&#13;
&#13;
                what the Bank needed to do in those days and after doing an initial prototype in the&#13;
&#13;
                Eastern and Southern Africa Department in 1986, effectively this went underground and&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t come back until 1989. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t actually use Token Ring then. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                actually do anything until years later. The same is true of Banyan Vines. We did&#13;
&#13;
                Banyan Vines with Token Ring in â&#128;&#153;86.&#13;
&#13;
                We did these prototypes in a couple of places and then the thing went underground&#13;
&#13;
                because we got a new Director. The new Director said, â&#128;&#156;People donâ&#128;&#153;t want this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
                People want computers and they want to print and printers cost a lot of money and you&#13;
&#13;
                need to focus on ways to share printers among an office area and take your&#13;
&#13;
                technologically driven choice of this fancy network technology and go put that on a&#13;
&#13;
                shelf and letâ&#128;&#153;s focus on meeting the short term needs of getting computers out there as&#13;
&#13;
                cheap as we can, as many as we can, as fast as we can, with printer sharing boxes.â&#128;? So&#13;
&#13;
                this decision was in effect, put on hold, Token Ring and Banyan Vines, for some years&#13;
&#13;
                later. Finally there was Digital All-In-One. The choice there was between All-In-One&#13;
&#13;
                from Digital and a product from Data General and another product from â&#128;&#147; who was the&#13;
&#13;
                other mini manufacturer? Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten the name. This was not really, in the end, a&#13;
&#13;
                very difficult choice. We were looking for an office system. If we had started off&#13;
&#13;
                looking for a mail system probably our choices would have been different. But we were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                33&#13;
&amp;#12;                looking for an office system. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s also important to recognize that at the time this&#13;
&#13;
                work was going on, we were already using All-In-One. Anita Russell, who came from&#13;
&#13;
                the White House, had brought it in.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      What year was that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       â&#128;&#153;84, and they started using All-In-One in the Finance Complex.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      As an office system?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       As a mail system and also as an application system. They successfully arranged for Mel&#13;
&#13;
                Ray to get attached to the online system. He fell in love with it, then implemented it&#13;
&#13;
                among all the managers in IRMD, where it trickled down in to IRMD. At the time that&#13;
&#13;
                we started looking for an office system, Mel Ray already had his mind made up; we&#13;
&#13;
                were going there. All-In-One, of course, was ultimately a spectacular success in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank - despite the fact that it didnâ&#128;&#153;t fit in with anything else we were doing and it didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                fit well with PCs.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      It didnâ&#128;&#153;t interface?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It didnâ&#128;&#153;t interface, yes. It was like a totally different world, and yet it was an effective&#13;
&#13;
                way for us to move into the delivery of information to staff. As a technologist I hated it,&#13;
&#13;
                but as an observer of the evolution of the interaction of technology with organization,&#13;
&#13;
                you had to love it. It enabled us to do things like Videotex and Request Services. There&#13;
&#13;
                was a pick on the All-In-One menu called Request Services to enable you to order&#13;
&#13;
                coffee or schedule a conference room or order business cards or . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       There were 50 of these Request Services in the end. And this was the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s first&#13;
&#13;
                network because everybody ended up having All-In-One.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And what year was that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       â&#128;&#153;89&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    34&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      How were the priorities and trade-offs for the implementation and maintenance of All-&#13;
&#13;
                In-One eventually decided?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This evolved over time.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       All-In-One probably had the most pervasive effect on changing the way the&#13;
&#13;
                organization functioned. Similar things happened in other organizations but within the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank this was a combination of e-mail connecting people plus additional services. The&#13;
&#13;
                office system, Request Services and the fact that All-In-One was also a vehicle for the&#13;
&#13;
                broadcast dissemination of internal and external information. had a major effect on the&#13;
&#13;
                way people did business.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      On the corporate culture?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       On the corporate culture. There was decrease in the kind of official memoranda . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I want to be sure we donâ&#128;&#153;t get ahead of ourselves because if weâ&#128;&#153;re still in the IRMD&#13;
&#13;
                time I think what George is saying is absolutely true and itâ&#128;&#153;s very important, but I think&#13;
&#13;
                this occurs a few years later.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      End of the 1980s?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, this is in â&#128;&#153;89. And if weâ&#128;&#153;re still back in â&#128;&#153;85 talking about the choices we made, we&#13;
&#13;
                chose All-In-One and we used it. It was perhaps the most single important thing that&#13;
&#13;
                we did in a way, not for the reasons that we picked it, but for different reasons.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       It evolved in this period of time from the initial selection. Because computing was still&#13;
&#13;
                considered to be expensive, managers were the first part of the hierarchy permitted to&#13;
&#13;
                have this technology. Managers communicated with managers. This was more of a&#13;
&#13;
                top-down implementation of technology within the organization.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Now, where does email fit into all this? When does email first come to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, with All-In-One.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                     35&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       It was a bundled package.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Email was what made All-In-One work; initially it was the primary thing we used it for.&#13;
&#13;
                But because All-In-One was more than email it enabled us to have all these other&#13;
&#13;
                valuable things.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How were the governance issues of All-In-One handled?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We both sat on a committee called the All-In-One Governance Board that nominally&#13;
&#13;
                controlled choices about All-In-One. George may not agree with me but I think in truth&#13;
&#13;
                that during the period of huge growth in All-In-One, which occurred from the shift to&#13;
&#13;
                ITF in â&#128;&#153;86 until â&#128;&#153;89 or â&#128;&#153;90, the primary driver for All-In-Oneâ&#128;&#153;s growth in those years&#13;
&#13;
                was Harinder Kohli and the investments. He saw that it was important to push&#13;
&#13;
                resources into this area .&#13;
&#13;
                Before we go on, I want to close out â&#128;&#153;85, â&#128;&#153;86, if we can. This other stuff is very&#13;
&#13;
                interesting because it very much shaped our culture, but there was one other choice that&#13;
&#13;
                was made in â&#128;&#153;85 separate from the five April Decisions. It was the so-called&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;institutional database.â&#128;? There was a lot of focus in that time on our corporate data&#13;
&#13;
                mode based on the concept of big institutional database. A group went off and did a&#13;
&#13;
                launching package on what our database ought to be. We picked a product that nobody&#13;
&#13;
                has ever heard of nowadays called IDMSR from a company called Cullinet. I dare say&#13;
&#13;
                that probably there werenâ&#128;&#153;t more than one or two applications ever written to use this&#13;
&#13;
                thing. But it was another example of one of these best of breed committees going off&#13;
&#13;
                and doing their thing. And I wanted to say that the set of decisions that we took in â&#128;&#153;85&#13;
&#13;
                led us to build four â&#128;&#147; possibly more, but four, at least â&#128;&#147; parallel distinct technical&#13;
&#13;
                environments that were operating within the Bank in the late â&#128;&#153;80s from â&#128;&#153;85 until â&#128;&#153;88.&#13;
&#13;
                One of them was this Vines Proteon Token Ring environment which was a local office&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    36&#13;
&amp;#12;                networking environment in which organizations that had a bunch of PCs could if they&#13;
&#13;
                wanted to use this Vines thing, string up a Token Ring, have a local file server and do&#13;
&#13;
                some stuff. It wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t talk to anything else. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no effective way to connect this&#13;
&#13;
                to All-In-One nor to the mainframes. Eventually, it became possible to connect those&#13;
&#13;
                token rings to IBM mainframe but at the beginning, not so. Second, was this&#13;
&#13;
                asynchronous environment dominated by a box called the VCX. When Harinder Kohli&#13;
&#13;
                took over, he said, â&#128;&#156;we need to focus on getting computers into the hands of people in&#13;
&#13;
                Operations and we need to enable them to do printer sharing and we need every one of&#13;
&#13;
                those boxes to be able to connect to All-In-One.â&#128;? Every box came with a serial card;&#13;
&#13;
                the serial card was connected to the wiring closet, with whatâ&#128;&#153;s called an asynchronous&#13;
&#13;
                line, a catacomb line, the simplest kind of connection where itâ&#128;&#153;s connected in to this&#13;
&#13;
                network of these asynchronous switches that would enable you to pick from menus and&#13;
&#13;
                get yourself connected to some box somewhere. All of this was done without any&#13;
&#13;
                networks involved. This is just asynchronous stuff. There were also these boxes for&#13;
&#13;
                printer sharing. These so-called â&#128;&#156;Net Commander Boxesâ&#128;? were all over the Bank. This&#13;
&#13;
                was really the primary environment in which the PCs operated â&#128;&#147; with this VCX&#13;
&#13;
                environment. Third was the All-In-One terminal server VAX Ethernet kind of&#13;
&#13;
                environment. Where we had the All-In-One boxes, we also had a few VAXes that were&#13;
&#13;
                running applications like the publications system, the PBD VAX, which originally ran&#13;
&#13;
                the Divinfo system, the cable VAX. All these VAX systems as well as all the&#13;
&#13;
                Macintosh network were growing up were kind of around Ethernet and of course All-&#13;
&#13;
                In-One is in that environment. And then, finally, there was the IBM 3270 SNA&#13;
&#13;
                environment. In beginning of â&#128;&#153;85 there grew up in this environment an application&#13;
&#13;
                which came to be very important in the Bank, the OPSMIS. Divinfo was the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                37&#13;
&amp;#12;                attempt to build the OPSMIS, initially in the VAX Oracle environment. It failed. You&#13;
&#13;
                can speculate a lot about that.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      MIS stands for Management Information Systems?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       MIS is actually a word thatâ&#128;&#153;s used everywhere. After Divinfo failed, the OPSMIS was&#13;
&#13;
                created here You probably know a lot about this, George.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I can fill in a little on the OPSMIS. The OPSMIS stood for Operations MIS. In the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank in the early to mid â&#128;&#153;80s, each regional Vice Presidential Unit had developed its&#13;
&#13;
                own management information system for keeping track of the work going on within the&#13;
&#13;
                region. Basically there were six regions with six different systems. The OPSMIS&#13;
&#13;
                consolidated all of the regional systems into a single system. The individual who&#13;
&#13;
                brought that together was Mike Ruddy, who was initially the Program Coordinator of&#13;
&#13;
                the East Asia and Pacific Region, but who then went to work for Ernie Stern, the Senior&#13;
&#13;
                VP of Operations. Basically, Mike modified the East Asia and Pacific system to take&#13;
&#13;
                into account some of the other regional idiosyncrasies and features. This became the&#13;
&#13;
                OPSMIS system, which was the first standardization across the Regions of an&#13;
&#13;
                Information Management System in which common information on the lending&#13;
&#13;
                program and work programs became available to senior management. It also included&#13;
&#13;
                time recording, travel, and consulting. It combined financial as well as operational&#13;
&#13;
                management information.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And that was what year?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It started in 1985.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was a big, big pill that went down hard since you were taking away degrees of&#13;
&#13;
                freedom from the Regional Vice Presidents and their staffs. Weâ&#128;&#153;re preceding ourselves&#13;
&#13;
                a little because we havenâ&#128;&#153;t discussed the decentralization of programming capability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               38&#13;
&amp;#12;                within the Bank. But at that point in time each of the RVPs had its own programming&#13;
&#13;
                staff, which was small and supplemented by consultants, You could have something&#13;
&#13;
                developed, which could then be maintained within a Regional Vice Presidential Unit.&#13;
&#13;
                This eventually became what I would call one of our first institutional applications,&#13;
&#13;
                everybody operating on the same set of software.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think the ways in which the OPSMIS affected the Bank â&#128;&#147; the evolution of IT and the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank are typical of the many ways in which this evolved. Let me harken back first of&#13;
&#13;
                all to these four environments I was talking about. Recall that this OPSMIS is only in&#13;
&#13;
                the fourth environment, right? In order to use the OPSMIS, you have to have an IBM&#13;
&#13;
                3270. You have to have a PC connected into the IBM environment and not everybody&#13;
&#13;
                has one of those. Every division has to have one, now. We get this parallel network to&#13;
&#13;
                enable everybody to get connected. Second, this is an application that was built by&#13;
&#13;
                people not familiar with building applications. A prototyping tool called Focus built his&#13;
&#13;
                application, but Focus was not meant to run real operational applications. We had this&#13;
&#13;
                massive amount of computing to solve a problem relatively small in computational&#13;
&#13;
                terms, but because the tools involved in the design of them were from a purely&#13;
&#13;
                computer science perspective really poor. But you have to evaluate Operations MIS,&#13;
&#13;
                not in the context of computer science, but in the context of its effect on the&#13;
&#13;
                organization. It enabled people to do things they could never do before. Hire a&#13;
&#13;
                consultant online. Book travel online. Those of us who were computer people hated&#13;
&#13;
                this thing because it was so awful and burnt so much money.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And yet, it worked!&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It worked.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      But if you hated it, was there not an alternative?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  39&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       If we could have mobilized the resources being put into the OPSMIS, yes. But thereâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                no way that IRMD could mobilize those resources. Mike Ruddy sitteth at the right hand&#13;
&#13;
                of Ernie Stern the Father Almighty. Mike could have anything he wanted and he could&#13;
&#13;
                overrule anybody. Nobody could stand up to Mike because he had Ernie. The most&#13;
&#13;
                powerful man in the Bank. The Senior Vice president of Operations could say, â&#128;&#156;Thou&#13;
&#13;
                shalt do this; thou shalt put an IBM 3270 PC in every division in the Bank and I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                care what it costs and youâ&#128;&#153;re going to pay for it.â&#128;? Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no way we could have done&#13;
&#13;
                that!&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was not about technology. This was basically about organizational control, using&#13;
&#13;
                the technology to control the organization. Prior to the implementation of the OPSMIS,&#13;
&#13;
                what you have is a Regional Vice President with his own data talking to the Senior VP&#13;
&#13;
                for Operations and the Senior VP for Operations not being able to compare across&#13;
&#13;
                regions because he has data that isnâ&#128;&#153;t comparable from a time standpoint. It isnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                comparable from a quality standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Even a definitional standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Even a definitional standpoint. So now, this is using technology to standardize the&#13;
&#13;
                information presented from a management control viewpoint.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       In trying to count the ways in which the OPSMIS had a big impact on the organization,&#13;
&#13;
                itâ&#128;&#153;s also important to recognize that the driving force of the OPSMIS was about&#13;
&#13;
                reporting upward. It was driven by the desire of senior management to have&#13;
&#13;
                information. It became a drag on the working level people in the Bank who got nothing&#13;
&#13;
                out of it; they only put stuff in to it, but did not help them me manage their projects. It&#13;
&#13;
                was â&#128;&#156;Big Brotherâ&#128;? looking over my shoulder wanting to know how my project was&#13;
&#13;
                going. OPSMIS was also single-handedly responsible for the huge growth in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  40&#13;
&amp;#12;                mainframe. At the end of 1982, we were spending $1 million a year at a little&#13;
&#13;
                organization called Timeshare in McLean, Virginia for people, who had resources but&#13;
&#13;
                enough computer time from CAD and/or from the Burroughs mainframe. started buying&#13;
&#13;
                time outside. By 1982 we were spending a million dollars a year at Timeshare. Peter&#13;
&#13;
                Hsueh and George and some other people, Jed Schilling, got together. They had this&#13;
&#13;
                idea. - weâ&#128;&#153;ll go out and buy this 3031.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       IBM mainframe â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       . . . put it into the D building, run this stuff in-house, and put in on chargeback.&#13;
&#13;
                Chargeback started in 1983 and it was an idea whose time had come, right? The Bank,&#13;
&#13;
                populated by all these economists, always believes in market economics. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s this&#13;
&#13;
                growing feeling that we can solve our priority dilemmas if we can just put all this on a&#13;
&#13;
                market basis. In â&#128;&#153;83 we start doing chargeback throughout the Bank for all computing&#13;
&#13;
                resources. The Burroughs computer went onto chargeback as did the IBM machine.&#13;
&#13;
                Works like a dream for the IBM computer, which grows and grows. Not only is every&#13;
&#13;
                unit in the Bank being charged to use it; the users donâ&#128;&#153;t even have a choice because&#13;
&#13;
                Ernieâ&#128;&#153;s telling them they have to! And Mikeâ&#128;&#153;s up there building more and more of&#13;
&#13;
                these applications written in Focus. Every time they implement a new application, they&#13;
&#13;
                sort of duplicate the database and make it twice as big! Thatâ&#128;&#153;s really horrible!&#13;
&#13;
                [Laughs]&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What about applications in the mid â&#128;&#153;80s?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This brings up the subject of of decentralization. The basic operating force is the&#13;
&#13;
                demand for the development of applications which canâ&#128;&#153;t be satisfied by the central&#13;
&#13;
                organization and which develops in accordance with standards that has reviews and is&#13;
&#13;
                done in what was considered at that point a professional way. For example, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                       41&#13;
&amp;#12;                applications had to be documented because a programmer might go off and someone&#13;
&#13;
                else had to maintain the application. So the demand grows but the capacity to meet&#13;
&#13;
                those demands doesnâ&#128;&#153;t grow at anywhere near the same rate. You have the&#13;
&#13;
                introduction of languages such as Dee talked about, Focus which a lot of people used as&#13;
&#13;
                a reporting vehicle. You created a small database. You could update the database to&#13;
&#13;
                report out of that. What people wanted most in the Bank was reports. They wanted&#13;
&#13;
                information presented in ways that they felt was more understandable. There was a&#13;
&#13;
                great deal of training on Focus. People went to Focus courses, became Focus&#13;
&#13;
                programmers and Focus grew. The pressures became too much. There was an attempt&#13;
&#13;
                to apply chargeback for applications development so when this was added to the&#13;
&#13;
                chargeback for computing services, in fact, our internal computing was quite&#13;
&#13;
                competitive. The reason that we were able to bring in the IBM mainframe was that we&#13;
&#13;
                could actually provide that service internally at a rate lower than what I could get&#13;
&#13;
                outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Way lower.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, considerably lower. But, when you have a staff member with Bank benefits&#13;
&#13;
                competing with an outside programmer, the economics didnâ&#128;&#153;t match anymore. This&#13;
&#13;
                was not the cheap hardware that you could buy on the secondary market that did the&#13;
&#13;
                same thing. So, it became economically non-viable. The way that problem was&#13;
&#13;
                handled was that the centralized programming staff that were doing applications&#13;
&#13;
                primarily for selected business areas such as Controllers and the Human Resource area&#13;
&#13;
                were decentralized to the the business units. In the mid-â&#128;&#153;80s you now had the&#13;
&#13;
                decentralization of the programmers and the applications development capability goes&#13;
&#13;
                to the business units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 42&#13;
&amp;#12;Dr. Becker:     And you saw this is as a beneficial development?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that it was either beneficial or not beneficial; the forces were such&#13;
&#13;
                that it couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be stopped.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I want to make a couple points. One is that in the IRM concept, decentralization was&#13;
&#13;
                envisioned because the concept itself called for local responsibility. Second, the&#13;
&#13;
                introduction of chargeback in â&#128;&#153;83 was the driving factor that ultimately led to this&#13;
&#13;
                because the Bank was new at chargeback. Here we have, on the one hand, fully loaded&#13;
&#13;
                costs associated with these programmers being recovered including the cost of the&#13;
&#13;
                programmers and the cost of their benefits but also the cost of all the management over&#13;
&#13;
                their head all the way up to the top was all part of the overhead cost that went in to the&#13;
&#13;
                cost of this staff member. So if Iâ&#128;&#153;m a guy in the Transportation Department and I want&#13;
&#13;
                to build a little model â&#128;&#147; a transportation model â&#128;&#147; I have my choice between buying a&#13;
&#13;
                person from CAD or IRMD who bears all of the institutional costs, all of the overhead&#13;
&#13;
                costs that the benefits cost, plus the cost of all of his management and their benefits&#13;
&#13;
                loaded onto them. Or, alternatively, I can hire a consultant myself, in which case, HR&#13;
&#13;
                will pick up all the benefits. Right? The mechanism, the definition of chargeback was&#13;
&#13;
                broken because the benefit load that was everywhere else in the Bank was paid for by&#13;
&#13;
                HR off my books. If I buy it through IRMD because of this desire to try to understand&#13;
&#13;
                the fully loaded cost, I have to pay that cost, twice. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not only that we were not&#13;
&#13;
                competitive. I mean, I suspect itâ&#128;&#153;s probably true that in the case of the computer&#13;
&#13;
                facilities, we enjoy a lot of advantages, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have to pay taxes, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have to&#13;
&#13;
                make a profit, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have to pay to some extent for all the space and utilities and all&#13;
&#13;
                of that sort of stuff . In the case of people stuff, however, all the advantages are stacked&#13;
&#13;
                against us. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no way we can fail to be cheaper than the world at large for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  43&#13;
&amp;#12;                computer cycles. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no way we can ever begin to compete in terms of people for&#13;
&#13;
                exactly the same reason. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the structure of chargeback and so by â&#128;&#153;85, it was a&#13;
&#13;
                hopeless cause. In fact, during â&#128;&#153;84 we were making so much money on the computers&#13;
&#13;
                that we were able to break even as a department but there was this great cry of foul from&#13;
&#13;
                all these self-same economists out there who believe in open markets because weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                commingling the funds.&#13;
&#13;
                Commingling was the hot word in â&#128;&#153;84 and â&#128;&#153;85. Everybody focused on our&#13;
&#13;
                commingling of these funds. We were over recovering for the computers and using it to&#13;
&#13;
                subsidize the fact that we were losing money on the staff. In â&#128;&#153;85 we did what the IRM&#13;
&#13;
                concept had envisioned, which is to decentralize all these people to the units. It was&#13;
&#13;
                like a big raffle. Units were able to take on the staff working on the applications which&#13;
&#13;
                they required or used, George is right. Most of them went to places where they had a&#13;
&#13;
                fairly well developed set of systems, such as Finance, where the accounting systems and&#13;
&#13;
                the treasury systems existed, HR or Economics. The regions, by and large, didnâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
&#13;
                systems in those days, except for the nascent development of the OPSMIS but mostly&#13;
&#13;
                they didnâ&#128;&#153;t import professional programmers.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       They brought in consultants and there were a few staff who had capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So, what then are the organizational implications of the decentralization in terms of&#13;
&#13;
                managing technology?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       You know what, I think one of the most interesting things is that I actually attribute the&#13;
&#13;
                long-term development of the so-called NRS problem to this. We implemented&#13;
&#13;
                chargeback in â&#128;&#153;83 and look what happened. We had a $5 million budget that went like&#13;
&#13;
                this almost over night [big vertical spike], in terms of the amount of money spent on&#13;
&#13;
                computers because of increased demand for computing. The minute we went on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 44&#13;
&amp;#12;                chargeback from â&#128;&#153;83 to â&#128;&#153;85, we jumped from something like $5 million to something&#13;
&#13;
                like $15 million. The staffing requirement to manage that went up at more or less the&#13;
&#13;
                same rate. But, the position control system demanded that we beg for positions in order&#13;
&#13;
                to add staff, During this period we made a deal with the Director of HR, Tony Williams&#13;
&#13;
                to use consultants to do this computing work. We then hired hundreds of consultants.&#13;
&#13;
                Many of them came from places like Tata Burroughs in India. We imported truckloads&#13;
&#13;
                of Indians who were fabulous programmers to make up this gap. Many of these&#13;
&#13;
                programmers are in very important positions in ISG today. Three years later, we&#13;
&#13;
                decentralized all of these consultants into the rest of the Bank. The Bank at large didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                have this NRS problem because mostly they were able to expand their work program&#13;
&#13;
                and their positions. The work they were trying to fulfill was the work program the&#13;
&#13;
                Board and Senior Management was interested in. For example, when we open up a&#13;
&#13;
                lending program in a new country and add positions such as an economist; money is&#13;
&#13;
                added to do the work Here we are with hundreds of people who were decentralized into&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank All of a sudden the Bank has a big problem scattered all over the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                There was money but no positions.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How did the Information Technology Facility come together in â&#128;&#153;86?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       At the end of â&#128;&#153;85 we struggled over the issue of co-mingling and trying to make ends&#13;
&#13;
                meet on chargeback. We were now three years into chargeback. We were buying lots&#13;
&#13;
                of equipment, at a ferocious rate. At the end of â&#128;&#153;85 there was an investigation. There&#13;
&#13;
                were some allegations about the way business was being done; the phrase was â&#128;&#156;certain&#13;
&#13;
                business practices.â&#128;? That investigation led to five people being fired from the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                Some were in IRMD and some were in ADM, in Procurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                45&#13;
&amp;#12;                In my my own view the people who left IRMD were by-and-large guilty of bad&#13;
&#13;
                judgment and not guilty of fraud or misappropriation of funds. The Bank lacked then&#13;
&#13;
                and still lacks good guidance for the staff on how to draw the line in dealing with&#13;
&#13;
                vendors when large amounts of money are involved. Some of these people were&#13;
&#13;
                probably in positions of authority without training or preparation for dealing with&#13;
&#13;
                vendors who are going to earn millions of dollars and who want to fly you off to so and&#13;
&#13;
                so and go to this conference or whatever. Some bad choices were made. In my opinion&#13;
&#13;
                people tried to do the best job they could for the Bank and make things work. The&#13;
&#13;
                following spring the director of IRMD, Mel Ray, left because he had failed to mobilize&#13;
&#13;
                support among senior management for the implementation and funding of his IRM&#13;
&#13;
                strategy. After the launching package there was still millions of dollars to be spent if&#13;
&#13;
                we were going to implement the strategy. There was no commitment from the Bank or&#13;
&#13;
                senior management to spend those millions of dollars. There had been this scandal.&#13;
&#13;
                Although Mel Ray was not in any obvious way touched by the scandal, you canâ&#128;&#153;t ignore&#13;
&#13;
                the fact that it had been on his watch and so he left. Bill Cosgrove, who was the head of&#13;
&#13;
                ADM, went to be the director of HR.&#13;
&#13;
:               The four Assistant Directors, two from ADM and two from IRMD then designed an&#13;
&#13;
                organizational change between the-then ADM and the-then IRMD to create two new&#13;
&#13;
                departments; GSD (General Services Department) and ITF (Information, Technology&#13;
&#13;
                and Facilities Department). There had been a huge increase in computers, including&#13;
&#13;
                personal computers, which doubled the air conditioning load and the electricity power&#13;
&#13;
                load. This effectively doubled the design limits on the buildings.&#13;
&#13;
                Second, ADM was responsible for moves, for moving organizations. The Bank has this&#13;
&#13;
                history of moving people all the time. All of a sudden they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t move an office&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 46&#13;
&amp;#12;                without getting us involved. All the moves were a disaster because coordination wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                good. People would arrive but the computers wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t work. Data communications&#13;
&#13;
                were growing faster than voice communications, Data communications was in IRMD&#13;
&#13;
                and voice communications was in ADM. To some extent itâ&#128;&#153;s the same set of wires and&#13;
&#13;
                people. One of the things we considered at that time â&#128;&#147; it ultimately didnâ&#128;&#153;t work out this&#13;
&#13;
                way â&#128;&#147; the we ought to be routing the data through a centralized ISDN switch to use the&#13;
&#13;
                same technology for the voice and the data.&#13;
&#13;
                Records Management was part of ADM. There was a growing awareness, that among&#13;
&#13;
                all the information needing to be managed, a huge amount was paper in the record&#13;
&#13;
                centers. There was all these tension between these two departments. The four Assistant&#13;
&#13;
                Directors designed a new organization which became ITF.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And GSD.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       That department was formed in â&#128;&#153;86, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Now, in the following year, the decision is made to equip each staff member with a PC,&#13;
&#13;
                is that right?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The following year, after the implementation of ITF, the Bank decided to reorganize.&#13;
&#13;
                We have, by now, maybe 1,000-1,500 personal computers in the Bank. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                reorganized the Bank. The question raised were: â&#128;&#156;Where do the computers go? Who&#13;
&#13;
                owns these computers? Do they go with the staff that are using them?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Is it personal or is it organizational?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Or do we try to track it from one organization to another and which organization does it&#13;
&#13;
                go to. If we split this division into two new divisions with two new bosses, what&#13;
&#13;
                happens to the computers? This, more than anything else, led us to grapple with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                47&#13;
&amp;#12;                â&#128;&#156;PCs for all" thing. Rather than trying to decide where the computers go, letâ&#128;&#153;s take on&#13;
&#13;
                this corporate initiative of equipping all the staff with a computer.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Now what is the impact on information management issues with this decision?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think there are, but youâ&#128;&#153;re still at a point where the PC is a personal productivity tool.&#13;
&#13;
                The degree of interconnection of the PCs in local area network systems.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Itâ&#128;&#153;s still only top management thatâ&#128;&#153;s really sort of connected. . ?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       No, you have All-In-One in operation at this time used by a a fair number of staff. Dee&#13;
&#13;
                is correct in his analysis that the organization driving this. Because making those&#13;
&#13;
                decisions, itâ&#128;&#153;s like Solomon; you split the child in half. But an aspect of supporting this&#13;
&#13;
                decision was that these tools do improve the efficiency of staff. Typing was a small&#13;
&#13;
                factor here as well. This was not something that a senior professional staff would do. I&#13;
&#13;
                can remember the first email I that I had ever got in the Bank, it said, â&#128;&#156;Call me.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                [Laughs] There were a lot of these older staff who didnâ&#128;&#153;t type whereas the newer staff&#13;
&#13;
                knew that typing was a necessary skill. I think there was a little foresight and a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                pragmatism operating here. This was an investment to address an organizational&#13;
&#13;
                problem but it also carried with it the potential for organizational benefits from an&#13;
&#13;
                efficiency and hopefully an effectiveness standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      So, in light of the â&#128;&#153;87 reorganization, the impact on information management was that&#13;
&#13;
                there was a computer for all, that it refocused attention on the information or&#13;
&#13;
                management of information issues?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think we ought to start with Harinder Kohli coming here in â&#128;&#153;86. This is the first time&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;ve had somebody who is an actual operational manager in charge of IT at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      He came in as Director of ITF?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   48&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       He came in as Director of ITF. He had almost a year as Director of ITF before the&#13;
&#13;
                reorganization. One of the first things he did say was, â&#128;&#156;You guys in the IT department&#13;
&#13;
                have been focused on Finance for far too long; the main business of the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
                Operations and I want to put a new stamp on ITF, I want you focused on Operations.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                Second, we had in the spring of 85 adopted the IBM PC as the standard. By â&#128;&#153;86 there&#13;
&#13;
                was a huge clone market out there. One of the managers went to Harinder saying, â&#128;&#156;Oh,&#13;
&#13;
                we have erosion around the edges; people are wanting to buy these clones, these terrible&#13;
&#13;
                clones, and we need you to come down hard on this and reinforce the standard that&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re going to buy the IBM.â&#128;? Harinder said, â&#128;&#156;The hell we are. Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to go buy&#13;
&#13;
                the cheapest thing we can find and get as many of them into Operations as fast as we&#13;
&#13;
                can.â&#128;? Harinder commissioned some guy to buy the cheapest clone he could find, which&#13;
&#13;
                was the ITS Turbo. This became legendary in the Bank as being one of the all-time&#13;
&#13;
                worst decisions.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well, he was part of another major decision as well.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, true. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure that it was such a bad decision but it ended up being a big&#13;
&#13;
                scandal. Anyway, we went bought hundreds of ITS Turbos. They were cheap and&#13;
&#13;
                made in some guyâ&#128;&#153;s garage. One was different from the next. They were really&#13;
&#13;
                horrible to manage but they enabled us to get a lot of computers out in a big hurry. The&#13;
&#13;
                joke about Harinder was that he didnâ&#128;&#153;t realize that nine women couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have a baby in&#13;
&#13;
                one month. He set this department on its ear. He wanted all his computers delivered in&#13;
&#13;
                a week or something. It was some incredibly short schedule. They made quick&#13;
&#13;
                decisions about what to put on these computers. One quick decision was to abandon&#13;
&#13;
                totally embedding the word processor in All-In-One. People wanted to use a word&#13;
&#13;
                processor on the computer. Previously we planned to buy Mass11. There was a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                49&#13;
&amp;#12;                campaign launched. Steve Denning, I think, was the main guy behind it saying, â&#128;&#156;This is&#13;
&#13;
                insane, this Mass11 thing takes nine diskettes in order to get it onto the computer.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                Harinder scrapped that whole idea and changed to WordPerfect. We were going to put&#13;
&#13;
                these computers out. We were going to have printer sharing boxes. We were going to&#13;
&#13;
                have Vterm for All-In-One. Every computer got the same stuff and were put out in a&#13;
&#13;
                big rush. He refocused us on Operations. Harinder also was the first one who sent&#13;
&#13;
                people into the field. He took two or three people and sent them to the country offices.&#13;
&#13;
                They went flying around on airplanes carrying modems, trying to get people able to dial&#13;
&#13;
                into headquarters so they could . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Connecting the Bank to the country offices. He was instrumental in that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, Harinder was the beginning of that. Without him, it never would have happened.&#13;
&#13;
                He was the one who sent a group of us to Indonesia in 1988 where we put in the first&#13;
&#13;
                All-In-One machine into a country office. It revolutionized the way that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                interacted with its country offices because all of a sudden we are able to do work on two&#13;
&#13;
                shifts. They are twelve hours different. They work in the day time and we work in the&#13;
&#13;
                day time. And so, work went on 24 hours a day for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And that was in â&#128;&#153;88?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       That was in â&#128;&#153;88. For the first time, Harinder refocused us on Operations. Historically&#13;
&#13;
                we had been a mainframe focused on the people who did mainframe things. Our&#13;
&#13;
                customers were in Finance and in Economics. No one in the computer organization&#13;
&#13;
                knew anything about what went on in Operations, who were perceived as not using&#13;
&#13;
                computers nor how they would use computers.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       A lot of the emphasis was on the OPSMIS. This was an institutional application that&#13;
&#13;
                used the big iron with the 3270. This was headquarters-based. Harinder started to bring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 50&#13;
&amp;#12;                technology, which looked more like office technology, into the field together with&#13;
&#13;
                communications. Actually having data communications between the field and&#13;
&#13;
                Headquarters was a first. These were point-to-point communications. There was&#13;
&#13;
                Indonesia-to-Washington, Washington-to-Indonesia. I can recall a long time ago the&#13;
&#13;
                people saying one of the nice things about going to a country office is youâ&#128;&#153;re not&#13;
&#13;
                connected to headquarters. You had a telex machine in the old days and that was it.&#13;
&#13;
                Telephone calls sometimes worked and sometimes they didnâ&#128;&#153;t work so you could be&#13;
&#13;
                incommunicado for a period of time. This was starting to break that from a data&#13;
&#13;
                communications standpoint. And now you have electronic mail starting to extend&#13;
&#13;
                beyond headquarters and into the country offices.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       In addition to focusing the Bank on Operations, Harinder was probably the first&#13;
&#13;
                manager we had, who recognized that this was more about information than it was&#13;
&#13;
                about technology. IRMD had gotten into trouble about the way it managed resources,&#13;
&#13;
                the way it managed money. Harinder had not been part of that. He had absolutely no&#13;
&#13;
                regard for the chargeback system or for the nominal rules developed to govern&#13;
&#13;
                chargeback.. Harinder put resources into All-In-One because he believed that All-In-&#13;
&#13;
                One was the vehicle for us to deliver information. There was no money source for the&#13;
&#13;
                investments being made or for the systems, the kind of quasi systems in All-In-One&#13;
&#13;
                Request Services. We should let George talk now about these investments and these&#13;
&#13;
                systems because this is where the Bank began to be transformed.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Do you want to break now or do you want to talk about it now? Itâ&#128;&#153;s up to you.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     We can talk about how the Bank was transformed actually, then this is a good place to&#13;
&#13;
                break because we can turn to something else.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                51&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Transformation starts with electronic mail and then with its use by staff as a primary&#13;
&#13;
                vehicle for communicating operational day-to-day business decisions. It also becomes a&#13;
&#13;
                record of these decisions. It has the aspect of information management. It becomes a&#13;
&#13;
                primary vehicle for making requests and coordinating action in the organization. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                know the details of the growth of this but there were studies done about how email&#13;
&#13;
                permeated the organization. We had The Rand Corporation here at one point â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       â&#128;¦ Several times â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       To look at the growth of this. It became the way people did their business. They came&#13;
&#13;
                to work in the morning, logged into a computer and looked at their mail. This was&#13;
&#13;
                transformational. Previously, you came in and looked at your â&#128;&#156;inâ&#128;? basket. Well, your&#13;
&#13;
                computer was your â&#128;&#156;inâ&#128;? basket now and the amount of paper mail started to decrease,&#13;
&#13;
                not that the paper ever stopped. Some people who didnâ&#128;&#153;t like the machines had the&#13;
&#13;
                secretaries print out emails. But, email was becoming the main communications vehicle&#13;
&#13;
                amongst staff. And on top of this, you had the broadcast kind of dissemination of&#13;
&#13;
                information as well. It took us years to stop the paper daily bulletin but that information&#13;
&#13;
                was on All-In-One, which became the mechanism for broadcasting information about&#13;
&#13;
                Bank-wide activities and news. Then there was Request Services. This feature tripled&#13;
&#13;
                the ordering of coffee and replaced the paper requisition forms. There was a joke; at&#13;
&#13;
                least itâ&#128;&#153;s a joke in my mind. At the time we were phasing out typewriters, we had just&#13;
&#13;
                automated the typewriter repair form, which appeared on the Request Services menu.&#13;
&#13;
                This transformation affected the way people actually did business, how they contacted&#13;
&#13;
                others and shared information, how they made requests and how those requests were&#13;
&#13;
                handled A major change occurred at Headquarters, which gradually permeated into the&#13;
&#13;
                country offices. This changes helped to integrate the organization. Email has the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 52&#13;
&amp;#12;                ability to break down the hierarchy. It gets us into â&#128;&#156;you copy everybody, including the&#13;
&#13;
                President. The Bank developed a culture of long distribution lists, which disseminated&#13;
&#13;
                information to everyone. If a staff member is not happy about something, he jumps two&#13;
&#13;
                or three levels in the hierarchy and sends an email. It changed the way that we do&#13;
&#13;
                business. It also increases the pace of work. People start to ask for computers at home,&#13;
&#13;
                which extend the work day. Years ago, it was thought the work week was going to&#13;
&#13;
                shrink. With the advent of remote access and the ability to be connected to your email&#13;
&#13;
                all the time, it is very common to see people working from home. There are pluses and&#13;
&#13;
                minuses operating here but it has changed the way people work.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Buck:       What exactly were the pluses? Itâ&#128;&#153;s useful also to realize that the&#13;
&#13;
                transformational effect isnâ&#128;&#153;t limited only to the way people work, but was also&#13;
&#13;
                manifested in the way the organization changed. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no way that you could have&#13;
&#13;
                implemented this so-called network organization on these major reorganization changes&#13;
&#13;
                without changing the way information flows. The hierarchical organizations existed&#13;
&#13;
                because there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a way for information to flow. Now, with email, itâ&#128;&#153;s possible to&#13;
&#13;
                have a more dynamic organization.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Shall we break?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Sure, I think itâ&#128;&#153;s a good time.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Thank you.&#13;

&amp;#12;Dr. Becker:     Good morning.       Itâ&#128;&#153;s Friday, November 9th and this is the second set of&#13;
&#13;
                interviews with George W. West and William McDonald [Dee] Buck. Iâ&#128;&#153;m Bill&#13;
&#13;
                Becker with the Business History Group and the George Washington University.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And Iâ&#128;&#153;m Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Oral History program.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Our guests this morning are Mr. West and Mr. Buck. Having talked about the&#13;
&#13;
                All-In-One and how it affected corporate culture and also the importance of&#13;
&#13;
                Harinder Kohli to this effort, we would like to begin today with the following:&#13;
&#13;
                How did the significance of these developments, that is the broad introduction of&#13;
&#13;
                office technology in the workplace, affect the management of electronic&#13;
&#13;
                documents and records and the use of electronic communications? Specifically,&#13;
&#13;
                what steps were taken to develop the in-house technology skills? What effect on&#13;
&#13;
                staff recruitment did all this have? Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Weâ&#128;&#153;re still in a period in which position control is operating. Increasing the&#13;
&#13;
                staff count to deal with new technology issues is still a constraint. Weâ&#128;&#153;re past&#13;
&#13;
                the â&#128;&#153;87 reorganization, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t believe there was any special provision made&#13;
&#13;
                from a Bank-wide standpoint for the technology portion of the Bank, at least, to&#13;
&#13;
                deal with the changes in what was going on. This was all done largely through&#13;
&#13;
                whatever small increases there were on positions and also through the use of&#13;
&#13;
                consultants; long-term. At this point in time there is recognition of the earlier&#13;
&#13;
                concepts that information does need to be managed, that it is not just&#13;
&#13;
                transactions in transaction processing systems but there is a great store of&#13;
&#13;
                information that exists within the Bank that is largely textual in nature, which&#13;
&#13;
                has to be managed and be accessible and available to primarily internal staff.&#13;
&#13;
                There is probably some recognition that there are external audiences for this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              54&#13;
&amp;#12;                information as well. Dee can help discuss the formation of the promotion of the&#13;
&#13;
                IRMD strategy and its information management side.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       If Mel Ray were here, he would have heart failure if youâ&#128;&#153;re calling it the IRMD&#13;
&#13;
                strategy. [Laughs] This was part of his big thing, which was to try to make it&#13;
&#13;
                the IRM strategy. Your question has very interesting overtones, which is the&#13;
&#13;
                effect on the management of electronic records from the introduction of office&#13;
&#13;
                technology.      Particularly post-1987 we began to prepare documents&#13;
&#13;
                electronically through word processing on everybodyâ&#128;&#153;s desk. It decimated the&#13;
&#13;
                electronic records program. Richard Gregory said prior to this introduction of&#13;
&#13;
                technology people typed up their Bank reports on multipart carbon paper and/or&#13;
&#13;
                with multicolor paper things. For example, staff knew that the green copy went&#13;
&#13;
                to Central Files or whatever it was.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      There was color coding?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes. If you happened to find one of those green copies, you just sent it to&#13;
&#13;
                Central Files. Now all of a sudden 50 drafts could be produced electronically.&#13;
&#13;
                If one little word is wrong, another draft is made, which meant that the&#13;
&#13;
                documents are to some extent never finished.        Theyâ&#128;&#153;re all on a private&#13;
&#13;
                individualâ&#128;&#153;s hard drive and they never get in the files! There is no mechanism&#13;
&#13;
                any longer nor is there process management. And on top of this, the upheaval&#13;
&#13;
                generated by the 1987 organizational change had an impact on the information&#13;
&#13;
                about a particular individual who had been working on this country and who had&#13;
&#13;
                a set of files. Now that individual was either no longer working here or was&#13;
&#13;
                working elsewhere in the Bank. His box of material were shuffled around and&#13;
&#13;
                huge amounts of files were lost. The records program was seriously damaged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            55&#13;
&amp;#12;                after these two simultaneous events, the broad introduction of office technology&#13;
&#13;
                to everyone, and the massive 1987 reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What about staff recruitment?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Was staff trained more? Was there an emphasis on in-house training to upgrade&#13;
&#13;
                staff skills at that time?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       There is constant training going on, the upgrading of skills. I was not in the&#13;
&#13;
                department at that point in time but my sense is that you still had the Library&#13;
&#13;
                kind of operation going so there was still dispersed repositories. Going back to&#13;
&#13;
                your comment on the â&#128;&#153;87 reorganization, with the departure of a lot of staff or as&#13;
&#13;
                staff changed jobs, records and historical information of the Bank went in the&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;circular fileâ&#128;?; the trash can.    From a technology standpoint those people&#13;
&#13;
                familiar with it saw the potential for the creation of documents in electronic&#13;
&#13;
                form and actually carrying that through to publication. But we havenâ&#128;&#153;t reached&#13;
&#13;
                that point organizationally because the documents were essentially compound&#13;
&#13;
                documents in that itâ&#128;&#153;s not just text, itâ&#128;&#153;s text; itâ&#128;&#153;s graphics, itâ&#128;&#153;s maps, itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
                combination of things. When you went to the publication process, all of those&#13;
&#13;
                were not together; they were still pieces that had to be put together. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                come a long but weâ&#128;&#153;re still not at the place where all of this comes together&#13;
&#13;
                electronically and then goes to a printing and graphics operation where itâ&#128;&#153;s just&#13;
&#13;
                dissemination of completed documents.        So for actually keeping it in an&#13;
&#13;
                electronic form for storage purposes we just have parts and not the full&#13;
&#13;
                documents.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s very true. Documents did not exist in final form until they were in&#13;
&#13;
                the print shop and the maps were added. Only at the point of printing â&#128;&#147; is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               56&#13;
&amp;#12;                first time that there is actually a final form document. So, the very appealing&#13;
&#13;
                idea that somewhere upstream we could capture these documents in electronic&#13;
&#13;
                form just has never been true       You talk about the introduction of office&#13;
&#13;
                technology in the workplace affecting the management of electronic documents&#13;
&#13;
                and records and the use of electronic communications, and then the effect of that&#13;
&#13;
                on staff recruitment. I donâ&#128;&#153;t understand the question.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:     Meaning were you recruiting staff more skilled in office technology?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We always attempted to hire staff who had technological skills appropriate to&#13;
&#13;
                the kinds of things being done. Of course the kinds of things being done&#13;
&#13;
                evolved and always have done so over time. There is always a bit of a problem&#13;
&#13;
                because the Bank has a perception that we will hire people at the peak of their&#13;
&#13;
                career and expect them to know how to do whatever it is. And yet in this&#13;
&#13;
                particular field, it isnâ&#128;&#153;t as if you went to Oxford 15 years ago and got a PhD in&#13;
&#13;
                Information Technology and that was good for your whole life! Itâ&#128;&#153;s not exactly&#13;
&#13;
                that kind of a field.&#13;
&#13;
Ms Zenni:       Were there budgetary provisions made for these technology skill needs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Messrs. Buck&#13;
&amp; West:         No.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I donâ&#128;&#153;t think there were any special budgetary provisions or training provisions.&#13;
&#13;
                ISG and its predecessors have always assumed that the people who are doing the&#13;
&#13;
                jobs have the technical skills to do them. But these technical skills require&#13;
&#13;
                constant refreshing and updating. Itâ&#128;&#153;s only more recently that there has been&#13;
&#13;
                some recognition that you have to continue to train the staff and to refresh and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              57&#13;
&amp;#12;                renew those skills, some of which are significantly different than what they&#13;
&#13;
                came into the organization with.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think at this particular juncture this was a very important point too. Because&#13;
&#13;
                recall that the PC revolution swept through here as it did everywhere else in the&#13;
&#13;
                mid-â&#128;&#153;80s. Prior to that time the technical skills we had on board were systems&#13;
&#13;
                analysis, systems design, programming with third-generation languages. In the&#13;
&#13;
                mid-â&#128;&#153;80s we make the transition. First of all we have an enormous requirement&#13;
&#13;
                for people with skills around PCs and office tools and communications. And in&#13;
&#13;
                addition to that, even the programming business changed with the introduction&#13;
&#13;
                of these fourth generation and fifth generation languages that require a whole&#13;
&#13;
                different set of skills. So hereâ&#128;&#153;s IRMD, then ITF, with this collection of people&#13;
&#13;
                who have received no training at the hands of the World Bank and who are&#13;
&#13;
                being asked to take on a whole new kind of work, which is a very important&#13;
&#13;
                point. We certainly did not get any help. Itâ&#128;&#153;s important to constantly keep in&#13;
&#13;
                mind that office technology as opposed to information technology was distinct&#13;
&#13;
                at those times.    It was a departmental phenomenon.       In the Center weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                grappling with the problem of how do we help people but at the same time how&#13;
&#13;
                do we pay for the resources needed to help them? How do we transition the old&#13;
&#13;
                resources into the new ones? But not only that, the old resources are being paid&#13;
&#13;
                for with chargeback revenue from mainframe computers and if we try to put&#13;
&#13;
                these people to work trying to support PCs, how are we going to pay for that?&#13;
&#13;
                We canâ&#128;&#153;t make the IBM mainframe users pay for people whose job it is to run&#13;
&#13;
                around and help maintain PCs. The chairman of the IBM Advisory Group&#13;
&#13;
                would have had our head!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       That was me. [Laughter] At least for a period of time.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      What happened to electronic communication at this point?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s expanding at an exponential rate of growth with regard to electronic mail.&#13;
&#13;
                Electronic mail with the attachments of the documents was also growing. It is&#13;
&#13;
                still the All-In-One period but people had developed sets of skills. Out in the&#13;
&#13;
                user community were individuals who could assist staff in using All-In-One to&#13;
&#13;
                do some fairly sophisticated operations. All-In-One had the ability to edit word&#13;
&#13;
                processing documents modification capabilities. That plus the ability to attach&#13;
&#13;
                documents causes electronic communication that is e-mail to mushroom. People&#13;
&#13;
                are transmitting not just the one-page notes; but fairly large documents now&#13;
&#13;
                through the network.        The technology part of the Bank, the ITS/ISG&#13;
&#13;
                predecessors, was able to keep ahead of the curve from a networking standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
                Once we brought the local area networks together capacity was not a problem to&#13;
&#13;
                handle this kind of traffic. You have a mainframe, you load it, load it and load&#13;
&#13;
                it. Response time goes down and people get frustrated. Another increment of&#13;
&#13;
                capacity is added, which is a big cost increment. During my association with the&#13;
&#13;
                network, it was able to keep ahead of that power curve. This was done by&#13;
&#13;
                periodically adding incremental capacity (bandwidth) to handle the growth.&#13;
&#13;
                From a technological standpoint, ISG predecessors handled that issue fairly&#13;
&#13;
                well. Sending electronic documents and consequently the number of people&#13;
&#13;
                using them grew as well.           This was accompanied by the emergence of&#13;
&#13;
                individuals in the units who became â&#128;&#156;expertsâ&#128;? on how to use All-In-One. They&#13;
&#13;
                became the trainers who disseminated knowledge of All-in-One throughout the&#13;
&#13;
                organization. The work of this group of people, known as the All-in-One&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             59&#13;
&amp;#12;                Coordinators, led to almost everyone in the Bank becoming familiar with All-in-&#13;
&#13;
                1 and how to use it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       There is one aspect of this training in All-In-One and use of All-In-One and the&#13;
&#13;
                way All-In-One worked that is worth remarking about. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve made the point&#13;
&#13;
                several times over on the distinction the central mainframe IT organizations and&#13;
&#13;
                the office organization, which created a chasm in those days. For example, if&#13;
&#13;
                you created a document or spreadsheet in your local PC word processing tool,&#13;
&#13;
                which you wanted to send it to someone through electronic mail, it was very&#13;
&#13;
                difficult. Electronic mail system was host-based â&#128;&#147; the mail was actually on a&#13;
&#13;
                big computer in the computer center. It was "IT" as opposed to "OT". It didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                have any way of interacting with the stuff that was on your local PC's hard drive.&#13;
&#13;
                And so we implemented all of these really bizarre shenanigans to enable you, if&#13;
&#13;
                you were a user of the mail system and who by and large didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand this&#13;
&#13;
                distinction, to attach documents to an email message. If you said to All-In-One,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;I want to send a fileâ&#128;?, and ALL-In-One would then ask you for the filename,&#13;
&#13;
                magical stuff would go on to upload these files from your workstation to the All-&#13;
&#13;
                In-One system where they would be transferred to the mail as an attachment.&#13;
&#13;
                Then the receiving person had to go through a similar set of shenanigans with&#13;
&#13;
                bizarre commands, which worked about eight times out of ten. If the least little&#13;
&#13;
                thing was wrong, it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t work right.        It was really a source of pain&#13;
&#13;
                throughout the organization. Staff had no idea how technologically difficult it&#13;
&#13;
                was to try to facilitate uploading information from a workstation hard disk into a&#13;
&#13;
                network because there was no network connection. Years later â&#128;&#147; when we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               60&#13;
&amp;#12;                wanted to introduce Lotus Notes, one of the great selling points was the ease&#13;
&#13;
                with which you could send attachments â&#128;&#147; word processing documents.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Well, let me turn to the next question, then. I think youâ&#128;&#153;ve already alluded to&#13;
&#13;
                some of this, but in 1989 the Board Paper on Information Management and&#13;
&#13;
                Technology Strategy moved from previous concepts in providing a guiding&#13;
&#13;
                framework for the acquisition, use and maintenance of IT. Please discuss the&#13;
&#13;
                outcome and extent of the changes brought about as a result in the 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       One thing I remember very clearly about that strategy thing was the agony on&#13;
&#13;
                the subject of whether or not the Bank should formally adopt as part of its IT&#13;
&#13;
                strategy any aspect of the delivery of IT to member governments â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
&#13;
                interaction with member governments. Historically, the Central IT organization&#13;
&#13;
                had some engagement with the operational side of the Bank where parts of a&#13;
&#13;
                lending operation had an IT component. Of course this was increasing in the&#13;
&#13;
                world at large. Developing countries themselves were interested in applying this&#13;
&#13;
                technology to solve their problems and turned to the Bank for help. Some Task&#13;
&#13;
                Managers would recruit external IT consultants, or some Task Managers would&#13;
&#13;
                come to ITF for help. There was clearly a need to do a greater degree of&#13;
&#13;
                mainstreaming of technology understanding and technology support for&#13;
&#13;
                operational work. And yet, our work in preparation for the presentation of this&#13;
&#13;
                paper to the Board gave us clear signals that we needed to shy away from&#13;
&#13;
                making any strategic statement about the delivery of IT anywhere but internally.&#13;
&#13;
                I think this reflected the general level of dissatisfaction with the technology&#13;
&#13;
                support services being provided internally. It was along the lines of, â&#128;&#156;We need&#13;
&#13;
                to get our own house in order before we start turning our attention to anything&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             61&#13;
&amp;#12;                on a larger scaleâ&#128;?. This had far-reaching implications for us. Subsequently, we&#13;
&#13;
                took that part of the internal organization focused on support for operational&#13;
&#13;
                work and transferred it to operations. The strategy was written. This was&#13;
&#13;
                probably the first occasion when the strategy had been written with a greater&#13;
&#13;
                understanding of the importance of information as opposed to technology. The&#13;
&#13;
                previous work that had been done before this was the IRM Strategy, which I&#13;
&#13;
                would characterize as having been largely IT-centric. It had a lot of technology&#13;
&#13;
                overtones. References to information was only in the sense of data management&#13;
&#13;
                and data models. This IT strategy for the first time focused on the information&#13;
&#13;
                in operations, largely textual information, reports. 1989 was early days for us in&#13;
&#13;
                terms of understanding how to bring about this integration. Even now some&#13;
&#13;
                may argue that we probably still havenâ&#128;&#153;t done it, but I believe that the World&#13;
&#13;
                Bank is way ahead of any other public agency in understanding the requirement&#13;
&#13;
                to integrate technology and information and yet still we grapple with this. This&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Strategyâ&#128;? paper set the foundation for that. It was the first time that we&#13;
&#13;
                formally put that as a goal.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I would agree with Deeâ&#128;&#153;s assessment on this. This was internal learning as&#13;
&#13;
                opposed to deliberate action. It was more strategy than the execution of a plan&#13;
&#13;
                to actually make something happen in an operational sense. The paper also&#13;
&#13;
                compared the kind and level of IT expenditures being made. Where was the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank in comparison to other organizations as to the extent of IT support per&#13;
&#13;
                individual? I remember numbers on the order of $10,000 per person per year&#13;
&#13;
                being spent on IT support and that in comparison to other organizations we were&#13;
&#13;
                somewhere in the middle. My assessment would be that it was important in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               62&#13;
&amp;#12;                setting direction but it didnâ&#128;&#153;t result in an operational work plan that said, â&#128;&#156;Now&#13;
&#13;
                these steps get takenâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     I think that leaps then into this next question.        The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s information&#13;
&#13;
                technology architectural framework for the â&#128;&#153;90s was articulated around two&#13;
&#13;
                main objectives: flexibility and cost effectiveness.      How effective was its&#13;
&#13;
                implementation in meeting the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business needs?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I want specifically to talk about the flexibility and cost effectiveness aspects of&#13;
&#13;
                this. I have mixed emotions about how effective this was. Hywel Davies, who&#13;
&#13;
                actually came a year later, said â&#128;&#156;When there is great uncertainty about the&#13;
&#13;
                systems environment, and great uncertainty about how the world of IT is going&#13;
&#13;
                to unfold, we turned our attention to infrastructure, to building good&#13;
&#13;
                infrastructureâ&#128;?. We were coming out of a time in which the idea of how the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank would approach the creation of corporate information systems was caught&#13;
&#13;
                up in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s own organizational model. The Bank had in â&#128;&#153;87 adopted this&#13;
&#13;
                silo-based organizational model followed by the systems environment.           We&#13;
&#13;
                established Data Administrators associated with each of these silos. Each of&#13;
&#13;
                these Data Administrators created or began to create the systems environment&#13;
&#13;
                for their silo, which was independent of all others. There was an absence of any&#13;
&#13;
                corporate data model. These systems by and large were useful for the business.&#13;
&#13;
                and tailored to what the leadership of each of those outlets felt they needed.&#13;
&#13;
                But, they werenâ&#128;&#153;t corporate in any sense and they werenâ&#128;&#153;t Bank-wide. This laid&#13;
&#13;
                the foundation some years later, actually seven or eight years later, for the&#13;
&#13;
                difficulties we had in launching the Systems Renewal exercise, where we had&#13;
&#13;
                seventeen different definitions of project in the Bank. One key factor in our&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                63&#13;
&amp;#12;                approach to IT architecture at the end of the â&#128;&#153;80s was embodied in this notion of&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;federated IT architecturesâ&#128;?. A lot of arguments went back and forth about the&#13;
&#13;
                federated system, which allowed the administrative group to set its systems up&#13;
&#13;
                the way it wanted, the Finance complex could set its systems up the way it&#13;
&#13;
                wanted and the Operations complex could set its systems up the way it wanted.&#13;
&#13;
                Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the direction we started going. From that time through the early â&#128;&#153;90s,&#13;
&#13;
                there was a lot of struggle and tension. A lot of this was politics between the&#13;
&#13;
                different factions here.&#13;
&#13;
In the first session, George made some points about the Operations MIS and how it had been&#13;
&#13;
                created by the Senior Advisor of Systems and Budget under the Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
                President of Operations, Mike Ruddy. Itâ&#128;&#153;s important and interesting that in 1987&#13;
&#13;
                when Barber Conable reorganized the Bank, he exchanged the two Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
                Presidents. Mr. Moeen Qureshi, who had been the Senior Vice President of&#13;
&#13;
                Finance, became the Senior Vice President of Operations.           And Mr. Stern&#13;
&#13;
                became the Senior Vice President of Finance. When Mike went to Finance, he&#13;
&#13;
                went there initially as a Senior Advisor.      Later he became Director of the&#13;
&#13;
                Accounting Department.&#13;
&#13;
                The important thing here is this particular operational silo had considered it their&#13;
&#13;
                responsibility to create a set of systems, which helped them perform operational&#13;
&#13;
                work. After the organizational change those self-same systems were decreed to&#13;
&#13;
                be financial systems. These went with Mike and Ernie to Finance, where a more&#13;
&#13;
                financial spin was put on them, as systems that enabled us to capture&#13;
&#13;
                information for the accounting system and what not. As a result of their ability&#13;
&#13;
                to set up requirements that enabled the entire Bank to access the accounting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 64&#13;
&amp;#12;                system, they were able to dominate the systems environment throughout the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank in a way that had both very positive and very negative effects. They were&#13;
&#13;
                able to insist that everyone use these systems, of which they had absolute&#13;
&#13;
                control. They were able to deliver some functionality, which the Bank did not&#13;
&#13;
                have prior to then. It made it possible to do things. And yet the systems were&#13;
&#13;
                dreadful. The choice was between having dreadful systems that achieve an&#13;
&#13;
                effect, versus having no systems at all. One has to honor them for having&#13;
&#13;
                created something.     At the same time, there was an enormous amount of&#13;
&#13;
                backlash around the Bank against these systems. And in the early â&#128;&#153;90s â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m not&#13;
&#13;
                sure what year it was â&#128;&#147; they moved from the previous generation of this to a new&#13;
&#13;
                generation called the Cost Accounting System.        The backlash was severe&#13;
&#13;
                throughout the Bank. From an IT architecture perspective, the creation of this&#13;
&#13;
                silo effect in these federated systems laid the foundation for this tension that&#13;
&#13;
                grew up around the systems. In the absence of any corporate architectural vision&#13;
&#13;
                on the building of these, we had warlords. On the systems side Mike had Ernie&#13;
&#13;
                standing behind him, and Ernie was the most powerful man at the Bank and so&#13;
&#13;
                Mike was able to win every argument about this.&#13;
&#13;
                We, in the IT Center were without any ability to influence the systems&#13;
&#13;
                environment, so we focused our energy on infrastructure. In the late â&#128;&#153;80s and&#13;
&#13;
                early â&#128;&#153;90s, the focus of the central IT organization was on trying to build the&#13;
&#13;
                network and putting the network in place. We also had own tensions there as&#13;
&#13;
                well. We had these four different kinds of technical environments that were&#13;
&#13;
                jockeying for position. Interestingly the silo nature of the systems environment&#13;
&#13;
                actually exacerbated the problem because youâ&#128;&#153;d form an allegiance between one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             65&#13;
&amp;#12;                of the sets of technical providers in the Center, who were interested in&#13;
&#13;
                promulgating say the IBM/SNA kind of environment. They thought that was&#13;
&#13;
                the direction we should go. They would form an alliance with one set of system&#13;
&#13;
                providers, in one of the silos, which would create a dipole. Over here there is&#13;
&#13;
                another set of system or technology providers in the Center providing the VAX,&#13;
&#13;
                VMS, Ethernet kind of stuff.       They formed a connection with the Finance&#13;
&#13;
                complex, which created another dipole..       We have these crossing dipoles&#13;
&#13;
                between central organization technology providers and system providers, which&#13;
&#13;
                just leads the Bank further and further into this fragmentation. This is how I&#13;
&#13;
                would characterize what was going on in terms of information technology&#13;
&#13;
                architecture in the early â&#128;&#153;90s.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So flexibility is not a word that you would use?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No, on the contrary, we went way too far with flexibility. We adopted this&#13;
&#13;
                federated scheme, which let everybody do what they wanted. Then we failed to&#13;
&#13;
                set any standards technologically in the Center because each one of the bodies of&#13;
&#13;
                interest in the Center was allied with one of these major groups. We were very&#13;
&#13;
                focused on highly flexible and highly cost effective technology but the big thing&#13;
&#13;
                we could have done to be more cost effective would have been to eliminate two&#13;
&#13;
                or three of them.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       From a technology standpoint, I think that the point that Dee made and itâ&#128;&#153;s in&#13;
&#13;
                your statement here (reads): â&#128;&#156;The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business needsâ&#128;?.              Just that&#13;
&#13;
                terminology itself assumes that one person can say what the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
&#13;
                needs are. We had multiple bodies saying what the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business needs were.&#13;
&#13;
                When you have multiple spokesmen interpreting what those needs are, you have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              66&#13;
&amp;#12;                the silo effect. One of the results of this was there was some standardization&#13;
&#13;
                going on with regard to the so-called â&#128;&#156;institutional systemsâ&#128;? â&#128;&#147; those things that&#13;
&#13;
                came out of the OPSMIS were transplanted into the Finance complex, which&#13;
&#13;
                then started to become institutional in nature. When you had an operational&#13;
&#13;
                travel request, it was an institutional thing. Everyone in the Bank then used the&#13;
&#13;
                same form screens. From a technology standpoint â&#128;&#147; and Iâ&#128;&#153;m reading Mike&#13;
&#13;
                Ruddyâ&#128;&#153;s mind â&#128;&#147; Mike was basically putting onto the screens, the 3270 terminals,&#13;
&#13;
                the paper forms, utilized previously as a means of making the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
&#13;
                processes routine and standard. We did not examine the workflow standpoint&#13;
&#13;
                behind those business processes. The focus was the automation of those forms&#13;
&#13;
                processes and the transaction. Those forms that went into the computer were&#13;
&#13;
                printed and someone signed them and sent them through the mail.. Electronic&#13;
&#13;
                signature only happened about two or three years ago..&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think from a corporate or an institutional standpoint we were not yet able to&#13;
&#13;
                say we knew exactly what the institutional needs were.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     I see. OK.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s important to recognize the symbiotic nature between the difficulties we had&#13;
&#13;
                on the systems side and the difficulties we had on the technology side. Mike&#13;
&#13;
                had a vision for moving towards incremental improvements in the systems that&#13;
&#13;
                he had started building, These formed the foundation for our being able to do&#13;
&#13;
                business that way. And yet that was in a particular technological environment,&#13;
&#13;
                which was cut off from any of these other technological environments. The fact&#13;
&#13;
                that Mike couldnâ&#128;&#153;t really put those systems on every desk was a factor that&#13;
&#13;
                prevented him from being able to really take these systems where he might&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              67&#13;
&amp;#12;                otherwise have been able to. We might have had a very different history if we&#13;
&#13;
                hadnâ&#128;&#153;t had these four different technological environments, but All-In-One was&#13;
&#13;
                in one environment; the OPSMIS and the COS and BAS in a different&#13;
&#13;
                environment; the loans systems were in yet another environment; and the&#13;
&#13;
                document creation and management was done in a fourth environment. People&#13;
&#13;
                were building operational reports and spreadsheets in their local workstation&#13;
&#13;
                environment. From our point of view in the Center, the objective became clear.&#13;
&#13;
                Architecturally; it was to try to integrate all this into one environment, which led&#13;
&#13;
                to this whole Enterprise Network stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     OK, right. The early 1990s saw a doubling in email users in the Bank and more&#13;
&#13;
                emphasis on opening of business communications possibilities and coordination&#13;
&#13;
                with other international organizations. How successful was this effort?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This is earlier than the early â&#128;&#153;90s. 1988, â&#128;&#153;89 and â&#128;&#153;90 were the years in which&#13;
&#13;
                email was doubling every year. I traveled to Europe a number of times in â&#128;&#153;89,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#153;90. We made these connections with OECD and FAO and WHO, as well as of&#13;
&#13;
                course the IMF. OECD was a particularly interesting case because there was so&#13;
&#13;
                much similarity in their technical environment and ours. They were heavy All-&#13;
&#13;
                In-One users; in fact, they were a heavier All-In-One user than we were. We&#13;
&#13;
                had abandoned the idea that we would actually produce documents in All-In-&#13;
&#13;
                One. Instead, the documents were being produced in a desktop work station.&#13;
&#13;
                All over the Bank people built their documents in WordPerfect for DOS on top&#13;
&#13;
                of their workstation. And they did email in All-In-One. OECD was different.&#13;
&#13;
                They actually insisted that you produce your documents in All-In-One using an&#13;
&#13;
                All-in-One word processor. They were a heavier All-In-One user than we were.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 68&#13;
&amp;#12;                They also had a Burroughs mainframe as we did in those days. At this stage&#13;
&#13;
                some parts of the Bank were still heavily in the Burroughs environment. So we&#13;
&#13;
                had a lot in common with OECD. We exchanged directories with them which&#13;
&#13;
                meant you could sit at your workstation and address an email message to&#13;
&#13;
                somebody at OECD without having to do anything particular; their directories&#13;
&#13;
                were embedded with ours.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      But who promoted the directory sharing?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;d say the biggest promoter of it was Marc Nodell.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was a possibility that was seen by the technology staff and acted on.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Which had no little business benefit, I think.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I mean, the amount of business that we did with OECD was not that large.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      What about with the United Nations?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, letâ&#128;&#153;s see. I need to be careful because of my own lack of involvement&#13;
&#13;
                with it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t mean that it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t important. My own sense is that there was&#13;
&#13;
                very little interaction with the United Nations from the central IT Department.&#13;
&#13;
                There was a lot of interaction between DEC (Development Economics), Shaida&#13;
&#13;
                Baidee, and the United Nations because of the exchange of data. And I think&#13;
&#13;
                that there was also interaction with the United Nations by Rick Barry and the&#13;
&#13;
                records person group . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      So there was greater interaction between the Bank and the UN within this&#13;
&#13;
                context?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, in the context of records management and the Access ACCIS Committee&#13;
&#13;
                that Rick participated in. I have to confine my own remembrances to the parts&#13;
&#13;
                of this that I knew about, which were the technological aspects. We had very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             69&#13;
&amp;#12;                little in common with the UN Secretariat. In fact, the UN Secretariat didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                really have much computing capacity in New York at that time; they were&#13;
&#13;
                mostly in Geneva where they had built this International Computer Center. We&#13;
&#13;
                had interconnected our IBM mainframe with the International Computer Center&#13;
&#13;
                (ICC) in Geneva.       But there was not much exchange because the ICC was&#13;
&#13;
                focused on providing IT services sort of for hire to all of the little UN agencies&#13;
&#13;
                that are scattered around Geneva and Vienna and Rome. They would have&#13;
&#13;
                loved to have sold service to us but we had as big a computer center as they did.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       They were still interested in selling services years later.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       They still wanted to sell services to us, but this is just not something that we&#13;
&#13;
                needed.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What about the Internet in these years?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I was the manager that signed us up to get on the Internet in 1991. At the end of&#13;
&#13;
                1990 Harinder Kohli left the department. The new Director was Hywel Davies,&#13;
&#13;
                who had been the Data Administrator in Finance Complex and who had rebuilt&#13;
&#13;
                the systems in Cashiers. I think it was at that point when a lot of this focus&#13;
&#13;
                began in the central department on the infrastructure.        Hywel very much&#13;
&#13;
                understood that because of this federated systems environment, and the wars that&#13;
&#13;
                were going on among the people within this environment, that the right thing for&#13;
&#13;
                the central department to do was to focus on trying to get the network in place.&#13;
&#13;
                Before Hywel came, I had taken responsibility in 1988 for the DEC (Digital&#13;
&#13;
                Equipment Corporation) computers as well as the Burroughs computers. And&#13;
&#13;
                the DEC computers were the ones running on this Ethernet. I have already&#13;
&#13;
                mentioned there was tension between us and our colleagues down the hall in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               70&#13;
&amp;#12;                IBM Facility Center.       They were all using Token Ring and the Banyan&#13;
&#13;
                environment wanted to be on Token Ring and all the DEC stuff and Apple stuff&#13;
&#13;
                was Ethernet.      I tried to bridge this gap between these two technical&#13;
&#13;
                environments by the formation of a little technical group, of the really serious,&#13;
&#13;
                heavy-duty technical guys who were engaged in the network stuff from both&#13;
&#13;
                ends of the hall. I would try to get them into a room and beat some sense into&#13;
&#13;
                them on how to bridge this gap. How can we connect these networks together?&#13;
&#13;
                How can we make one Bank network instead of seven? They had started talking&#13;
&#13;
                to each other on their own â&#128;&#147; I take no credit for that, but I became their&#13;
&#13;
                "management sponsor". Because I was a technical guy at heart, I was able to&#13;
&#13;
                communicate with them about this, to understand it better, I think, than the other&#13;
&#13;
                managers.&#13;
&#13;
                At the risk of being too technical, let me just say that we had seven protocol&#13;
&#13;
                architectures in the Bank at that point. We had the IBM so-called System&#13;
&#13;
                Network Architecture (SNA).        We had a similar thing in the Burroughs&#13;
&#13;
                environment, which was called BNA (Burroughs Network Architecture). We&#13;
&#13;
                had people with Macintoshes everywhere, so there was an AppleTalk network&#13;
&#13;
                layered on top of the Ethernet. We had Novell Netware in three or four places&#13;
&#13;
                around the Bank, including HR. HR people of course were everywhere because&#13;
&#13;
                they were connected with the units they served, so the Novell stuff was&#13;
&#13;
                everywhere in many places. We had DECnet, which was for Digital equipment.&#13;
&#13;
                The central All-in-One systems and all that sort of stuff was on DECnet. We&#13;
&#13;
                had Banyan Vines, which we had established in 1985, and it had sort of gone&#13;
&#13;
                underground during Harinder Kohliâ&#128;&#153;s time because he had told us to focus on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               71&#13;
&amp;#12;                operations. And finally, we had TCP/IP, which was more or less out of the&#13;
&#13;
                UNIX world. It was probably pretty clear to a number of people by the late â&#128;&#153;80s&#13;
&#13;
                that this was the sort of unifying direction that we needed to go. It was non-&#13;
&#13;
                proprietary, and available to everyone. Most of the vendors were beginning to&#13;
&#13;
                flirt with providing TCP/IP as well as their own proprietary architecture. Our&#13;
&#13;
                unifying direction was to try to go in this direction of TCP/IP. All the guys&#13;
&#13;
                engaged in the network work at the technical levels understood the importance&#13;
&#13;
                of this, although they clung tenaciously to their own views about exactly which&#13;
&#13;
                kind of equipment we ought to use and some of the technical details.&#13;
&#13;
                When Hywel came to ITF with the idea that we should focus on infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
                and build a network, I was in love with that idea. I managed to persuade him&#13;
&#13;
                that the vision of this group of people that I was trying to lead was the direction&#13;
&#13;
                that we should go. One of these cases of â&#128;&#156;be careful what you wish for, because&#13;
&#13;
                you may get it.â&#128;? As a technical person all my life, itâ&#128;&#153;s always been the case you&#13;
&#13;
                feel like you know what the Bank should do, â&#128;&#156;if the Bank would only listen to&#13;
&#13;
                me, by golly, I know what we should do,â&#128;? and here, this is like a dream come&#13;
&#13;
                true. Here comes the director and heâ&#128;&#153;s going to listen to me, heâ&#128;&#153;s going to do&#13;
&#13;
                what I want him to do, but now you have to actually deliver! [Laughs] TCP/IP&#13;
&#13;
                was where we wanted to go, and TCP/IP is the language of the Internet. I shall&#13;
&#13;
                try now to connect back to your question about the Internet. It was absolutely&#13;
&#13;
                crystal clear to us that we needed to get the Bank on the Internet. Now by way&#13;
&#13;
                of context, let me just point out in case anybody doesnâ&#128;&#153;t know that at this point&#13;
&#13;
                there was no such thing as the World Wide Web. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t exist. The Internet&#13;
&#13;
                means some protocols, FTP, Telnet, in fact at this point there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                72&#13;
&amp;#12;                something called Gopher, which came later. Internet was not a good vehicle for&#13;
&#13;
                information delivery as it is today. It was exchange of information.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Among largely technical people. This was text information.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We attached the Bank to the Internet in 1991. In those days there was no such&#13;
&#13;
                thing as an ISP.     There werenâ&#128;&#153;t any such people companies.          We actually&#13;
&#13;
                connected through the Southeastern Universities Regional Network (SURAnet),&#13;
&#13;
                which was, I think, out of College Park. Of course it was a very different kind&#13;
&#13;
                of a thing there. It was all sort of self-administered. The National Science&#13;
&#13;
                Foundation had a contract with Merit, which ran the national network for&#13;
&#13;
                everyone. There was not much money involved in it and it really didnâ&#128;&#153;t cost us&#13;
&#13;
                much of anything to do. One of the interesting things was we registered at that&#13;
&#13;
                point for what was called a Class B Network, which is a large body of IP&#13;
&#13;
                addresses, which we still use today. If we had delayed a few years, we would&#13;
&#13;
                never have been able to get that. It was by virtue of our getting in early that we&#13;
&#13;
                were able to establish ourselves in this environment. Anyway, Iâ&#128;&#153;m giving you&#13;
&#13;
                way too much technical stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Itâ&#128;&#153;s very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think what this showed â&#128;&#147; at least to me â&#128;&#147; was that most of the Bank knew&#13;
&#13;
                nothing of this at all. One of the functions of the IT department had been to&#13;
&#13;
                shield the lay users from what was an extremely complex environment. The&#13;
&#13;
                Bank was early in terms of positioning itself to use the Internet and a lot of the&#13;
&#13;
                connections were university connections. But most of it was of a technical&#13;
&#13;
                nature. You had to know what FTP and Telnet and the commands were in order&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                73&#13;
&amp;#12;                to be able to access the information that was available on this network. And&#13;
&#13;
                most Bank staff had no idea of what that was.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So this was the technical people communicating outside the Bank on technical&#13;
&#13;
                matters?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It is interesting. Right from the beginning one of the things that exists on the&#13;
&#13;
                Internet that sometimes is conceptually difficult to explain is Usenet which is&#13;
&#13;
                actually so-called â&#128;&#156;news groupsâ&#128;?. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the discussion groups that existed for&#13;
&#13;
                many years layered on top of the Internet. You could get access to various news&#13;
&#13;
                groups. And it was clear to us right from the beginning that the news groups&#13;
&#13;
                would be very valuable to people. However, the obstacle lay in making it&#13;
&#13;
                possible for people to get at that news group in a way that they can actually use&#13;
&#13;
                it. First of all, there is the layering of all the technical junk that you have to get&#13;
&#13;
                through. You have to get your workstation set up with all this stuff before you&#13;
&#13;
                can even make a connection to it. Then you have to have some software that&#13;
&#13;
                knows how to interact. And none of that existed! If you were a Macintosh user,&#13;
&#13;
                you could do all that.      But, if you were a PC user there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t even a&#13;
&#13;
                newsreader. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t even buy one! Not to mention the fact that you had&#13;
&#13;
                to get all this TCP stuff onto your PC. Even though we were able to put our&#13;
&#13;
                hands on this stuff in 1991, it was 1993 before we could actually begin to deliver&#13;
&#13;
                this to people. And by 1993 people called me up every day, kids whoâ&#128;&#153;ve come&#13;
&#13;
                out of college to work for the Bank and who had their PhD, asking         â&#128;&#156;How do I&#13;
&#13;
                get on the Internet?â&#128;? And my answer was, â&#128;&#156;Technically, itâ&#128;&#153;s a piece of cake for&#13;
&#13;
                us to do thatâ&#128;?. The difficulty was we had no process in place for installing this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   74&#13;
&amp;#12;                nor was there anybody you could call. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a support structure. We&#13;
&#13;
                had to build all of that! We had to build the processes; we had to build the&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;backroomâ&#128;?. There had to be somebody whose job it was to manage all of the&#13;
&#13;
                addressing stuff. Then if you called up, somebody would come to your office to&#13;
&#13;
                put this stuff on your computer, set you up in the central directories with the IP&#13;
&#13;
                address, map your name, and set all this up for you. Once you starting using it,&#13;
&#13;
                if you ran into trouble, there had to be somebody you could call, who would&#13;
&#13;
                come to your office. This was a huge thing for us to put in place!&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And we were operating into in a chargeback environment. The requests were&#13;
&#13;
                being made but the mechanisms to handle those requests . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Meanwhile . . . sorry, not to interrupt you, George, but what was happening&#13;
&#13;
                outside of the Bank in other large-scale organizations. How did we compare&#13;
&#13;
                with them?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think we were ahead.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know of anybody, other than universities who had this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And the military.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And the military, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       But corporate America by and large didnâ&#128;&#153;t have it.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     This is about 1993 weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m still probably â&#128;&#153;91, â&#128;&#153;92. In â&#128;&#153;91, â&#128;&#153;92 when we decided we were going to do&#13;
&#13;
                this, I knew no other organization that was doing it. In fact, we said to each&#13;
&#13;
                other that if we could get this working in the Bank on PCs, now this is the trick I&#13;
&#13;
                guess I need to say. If this had been an entirely Macintosh shop we could have&#13;
&#13;
                done this five times faster. We could have had it all in place by the end of â&#128;&#153;92,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                75&#13;
&amp;#12;                Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure. The difficulty was that the PC is the only operating system that comes&#13;
&#13;
                with the PC that doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have built-in networking. Every other operating system&#13;
&#13;
                has the networking just built right into the computer. If we had been on OS2, if&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;d have been on Macintosh, if weâ&#128;&#153;d have been on UNIX, it would have been&#13;
&#13;
                easy . . . but as it was we were on DOS and later /Windows 3.1, which didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                have any networking. You had to buy something and add on to it. Any time you&#13;
&#13;
                added something to the delicate systems in those days, you tended to make them&#13;
&#13;
                unstable. If you wanted to buy Novell, of course you could hook to a Novell&#13;
&#13;
                network, if you wanted to buy Banyan, you could hook to a Banyan network. If&#13;
&#13;
                you wanted to hook to TCP/IP, you could buy some commercial product to hook&#13;
&#13;
                into TCP/IP. But if you wanted to be on multiple networks, if you wanted to be&#13;
&#13;
                on a Banyan network and on TCP/IP, boy, that was really hard and nobody was&#13;
&#13;
                doing it. We set out to engineer this thing, to make it possible for the Bank to do&#13;
&#13;
                this. That is what we did most of 1992. By 1993 we had some stuff working.&#13;
&#13;
                We went to the LAC Region as the pilot organization. We did pilot tests in&#13;
&#13;
                LAC trying to get this stuff working in â&#128;&#153;93 and â&#128;&#153;94. We had a hard time. At the&#13;
&#13;
                same time that weâ&#128;&#153;re doing this, sort of working on the workstation itself â&#128;&#147; that&#13;
&#13;
                piece of it â&#128;&#147; we were also building this entire backroom infrastructure. Now,&#13;
&#13;
                there is something running called the Network Operations Center in FIRM-H&#13;
&#13;
                and staffed 24 hours a day, We have people with monitors and all that sort of&#13;
&#13;
                stuff to be sure the network is running.      We had to put in place a trouble&#13;
&#13;
                ticketing system to manage all this infrastructure that was all over all these&#13;
&#13;
                buildings and do troubleshooting. We had to put in place the Domain Name&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                76&#13;
&amp;#12;                System, the DNS, which is sort of this world-wide distributed network of&#13;
&#13;
                mapping names onto addresses.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So youâ&#128;&#153;re saying the Bank was doing this before the technology was&#13;
&#13;
                independently available out in the market?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Right. Well, before it was available in an integrated way, you had to buy little&#13;
&#13;
                bits and pieces and glue them together.       Today of course you can buy a&#13;
&#13;
                computer and it has TCP/IP and the tools all integrated in. But in these days that&#13;
&#13;
                wasnâ&#128;&#153;t true. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t true even up until â&#128;&#153;96 or â&#128;&#153;97 that you could get a PC that&#13;
&#13;
                had this stuff built in. There were several aspects to it. There was the work that&#13;
&#13;
                had to be done on the PC itself, the engineering - actually even today we&#13;
&#13;
                engineer the workstation. The ED3 desktop today still has to be engineered&#13;
&#13;
                because there are thousands and thousands of different settings. If you want it to&#13;
&#13;
                be standardized â&#128;&#147; be the same from one workstation to the next â&#128;&#147; you have to&#13;
&#13;
                put the time into it. Let me make a point here that I think will be important for&#13;
&#13;
                everything. Any credibly competent technical person can take a fresh PC out&#13;
&#13;
                the box equipped with a set of CDs and disks and stuff and build a working&#13;
&#13;
                configuration, install all the software and get it working in about three hours.&#13;
&#13;
                People wanted to know, how come it takes us three months to engineer a new&#13;
&#13;
                configuration? The answer was, if a technical person builds one of these things&#13;
&#13;
                in three hours or something, chances are itâ&#128;&#153;ll be 90% of what they need. Over&#13;
&#13;
                the course of the next five or six days, theyâ&#128;&#153;ll make little adjustments here and&#13;
&#13;
                there. Something will go wrong and theyâ&#128;&#153;ll fix it.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And customize it more?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               77&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Theyâ&#128;&#153;ll make a little change here, a little change there. But the important thing&#13;
&#13;
                is that when they would declare it was finished, I would say that itâ&#128;&#153;s at 97% or&#13;
&#13;
                something. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the difference between 97% and 99.9% that takes all the time. I&#13;
&#13;
                can get a computer working in no time, but if something goes wrong, I know&#13;
&#13;
                how to fix it. But, if a Bank staff member is in a hotel room in Kazakhstan and&#13;
&#13;
                the printer driver doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work, he canâ&#128;&#153;t fix it! It has to be right. We have a&#13;
&#13;
                problem with perception in the Bank at large because all of these Bank staff&#13;
&#13;
                members have 12-year-old kids that can take computers out of a box and make&#13;
&#13;
                them run inside of seven or eight hours! If dad is working away and the thing&#13;
&#13;
                crashes or something goes wrong or wontâ&#128;&#153; print, he calls the kid over. The kid&#13;
&#13;
                tinkers around till he manages to fixes it. On the fly, mind you. In the process,&#13;
&#13;
                perhaps something else gets broken but it isn't something that matters to this&#13;
&#13;
                user, or it doesn't show up till the next time he has to perform some operation&#13;
&#13;
                which he does rarely. Now also remember that the kid at this address has a&#13;
&#13;
                computer and the kid in the next house has another computer and those two&#13;
&#13;
                computers have nothing in common with each other; theyâ&#128;&#153;re not at all similar. If&#13;
&#13;
                dad calls the kid to fix the computer, the kid knows everything heâ&#128;&#153;s done.&#13;
&#13;
                But, if that kid had to go to the house next door to fix that computer, itâ&#128;&#153;s going&#13;
&#13;
                to be a whole different kettle of fish because he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t know how itâ&#128;&#153;s set up; he&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t do it. Now, our problem in the Bank is we have 12,000 computers. What&#13;
&#13;
                we used to have in the early â&#128;&#153;90s was that everyone of them was different. If&#13;
&#13;
                youâ&#128;&#153;re the support guy and receive a call from somebody who says the printer is&#13;
&#13;
                not working, you have no idea what youâ&#128;&#153;re going to find! You go in there, there&#13;
&#13;
                have been 50 different people who have worked on this computer and every one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               78&#13;
&amp;#12;                of them has done something different. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve messed with it and theyâ&#128;&#153;ve got&#13;
&#13;
                something or other working. The HR guy was in here last week and he installed&#13;
&#13;
                the HR Query package and he changed the ODBC drivers. I know you probably&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t even know what that means but he did this and he did that and he did the&#13;
&#13;
                other thing and he got his stuff working and he left! In the process heâ&#128;&#153;d blown&#13;
&#13;
                away two or three other things that used to work, right? The user doesnâ&#128;&#153;t even&#13;
&#13;
                know that this is the case. It might be a week and a half later â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;ll try to print&#13;
&#13;
                something out or Iâ&#128;&#153;ll try to do something that I havenâ&#128;&#153;t done for awhile that used&#13;
&#13;
                to work and it wonâ&#128;&#153;t work anymore! And I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on. So Iâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
&#13;
                call somebody to come here. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ll mess around for two or three hours, When&#13;
&#13;
                theyâ&#128;&#153;re finished, theyâ&#128;&#153;ll have broken HR Query! One of the big challenges in&#13;
&#13;
                this 92 time frame was to supply this standardized technology for the Bank We&#13;
&#13;
                began to say to ourselves, â&#128;&#156;We need to standardize this stuff. It needs to be the&#13;
&#13;
                same for every computer. We need to have an installer just like you get from&#13;
&#13;
                Lotus or Microsoft or somebodyâ&#128;?. You put a CD in the thing and you punch a&#13;
&#13;
                button and it puts everything in the World Bank system on your computer.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Do you want to take a break at this point?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Whatever you all want. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not in pain.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     OK, letâ&#128;&#153;s continue on. As the Bank grew more and more dependent on email&#13;
&#13;
                and carried out many of its business activities, how did it address the substantive&#13;
&#13;
                and potential long-term institutional value of the electronic information&#13;
&#13;
                produced?     What policies were put into place in addressing the role of&#13;
&#13;
                information? Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                79&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       What we did from a policy standpoint was probably not all that definitive. I&#13;
&#13;
                would say that we started to collect a lot of information that grew and grew. I&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t think we had any policy with regard to how long we would retain it. We&#13;
&#13;
                may have had some but this was and is still somewhat of an issue within the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank now. We now have a legal requirement that says you retain email for two&#13;
&#13;
                years, but the pronouncement on that is about two years old.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think one of the things that did happen at this point was that the modifications&#13;
&#13;
                to All-In-One to enable you to put important material into the files . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, one modification was the designation of an Official Memorandum. That as&#13;
&#13;
                a policy, you could send or receive something that then would go to a records&#13;
&#13;
                center for inclusion in the official records of the Bank. But that came several&#13;
&#13;
                years after we were well into using All-In-One.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Yes, I recall, around â&#128;&#153;93, in All-In-One, there was something called institutional&#13;
&#13;
                files you could copy to, or there was a feature that asked you if it was official&#13;
&#13;
                mail or unofficial.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Official mail. This was the recognition that this was an electronic document that&#13;
&#13;
                needed to be printed out to go into the paper files, the project files, or whatever files, but&#13;
&#13;
                it was incumbent upon the staff member to do this. The mechanism was put in place to&#13;
&#13;
                do that. In fact, there is a mechanism now within the IRIS system â&#128;&#147; not implemented&#13;
&#13;
                totally across the Bank â&#128;&#147; which is our document management system where the staff&#13;
&#13;
                member working within Lotus Notes can specify that a Notes email or document can go&#13;
&#13;
                into an official file or project file of some sort. So the aspect from a policy standpoint is&#13;
&#13;
                there was at least recognition that some of these documents largely generated via the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   80&#13;
&amp;#12;                electronic mail system needed to have a provision for storage â&#128;&#147; for long-term storage&#13;
&#13;
                and retention.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well, the institutional value was recognized.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Oh, yes, clearly it was recognized that the officially digitalized documents&#13;
&#13;
                needed to be retained. The official business of the Bank was being conducted&#13;
&#13;
                more and more via the electronic mail system As we start to get into Lotus&#13;
&#13;
                Notes mail with attachments, which became more and more easily done, then&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re wholesale into conducting business in the Bank. One of the ways that I&#13;
&#13;
                tend to think about this â&#128;&#147; and this right now is an issue for ISG â&#128;&#147; is that when&#13;
&#13;
                people are at their terminal, most of them are living in Lotus Notes. They may&#13;
&#13;
                go off to Internet Explorer or do processing a transaction for travel or a financial&#13;
&#13;
                transaction but most of the time they are conducting business in Notes mail.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Today.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Today. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s the recognition that whatâ&#128;&#153;s generated in Notes is in fact the&#13;
&#13;
                official work of the Bank. This is where decisions are being made. This is&#13;
&#13;
                where weâ&#128;&#153;re recording in electronic form what is going on. That also creates&#13;
&#13;
                some problems as we go along. In certain cases the keeping of the records is&#13;
&#13;
                one thing but the actual financial controls where you are committing the&#13;
&#13;
                organization electronically via an email memo of some sort is a different thing.&#13;
&#13;
                There is recognition, I think, in the Finance complex of that. I can recall that&#13;
&#13;
                various pronouncements have been made in the last six or seven years that you&#13;
&#13;
                have to be careful as to what you do from an electronic standpoint. These are&#13;
&#13;
                the financial transactions, because there is a capability to modify these records.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 81&#13;
&amp;#12;                So the security controls on these things are somewhat at issue. Less so with&#13;
&#13;
                Lotus Notes but there still is some . . .&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     I think a major issue in any financial institution is the security of the records and&#13;
&#13;
                people from the outside getting into these records.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       There is recognition of this, but this is still something thatâ&#128;&#153;s in process and will&#13;
&#13;
                continue to be as technology changes. The provisioning that this message is an&#13;
&#13;
                official document to the World Bank gets recognized but that at least is the&#13;
&#13;
                point.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if it was late â&#128;&#153;80s or early â&#128;&#153;90s, but it was . . . â&#128;&#153;89, â&#128;&#153;91, â&#128;&#153;92. A lot&#13;
&#13;
                of things were changing around that time. I thought Iâ&#128;&#153;d make one point about&#13;
&#13;
                the official mail thing. Perhaps it was the tension between culture and business&#13;
&#13;
                needs and technology, again. It was important to try to adopt the mail system so&#13;
&#13;
                that it would enable the capture of important electronic references. But doing&#13;
&#13;
                this comes at the expense of our taking a piece of vendor software and making&#13;
&#13;
                major modifications to it and then putting that in place of the Macintosh. This&#13;
&#13;
                particular activity and the ramifications of it is not well-understood outside of&#13;
&#13;
                the technology space. It is a practice that weâ&#128;&#153;ve engaged in all the way back to&#13;
&#13;
                the beginning and that we, the technologist, want very much to stop. We made&#13;
&#13;
                this change to All-In-One and immediately our All-In-One is different from all&#13;
&#13;
                the other All-In-Ones in the world. Very shortly thereafter, Digital comes along&#13;
&#13;
                with a new version of All-In-One, which has all these features that we want and&#13;
&#13;
                itâ&#128;&#153;s more efficient. Eventually Digital will expect all its customers to move to&#13;
&#13;
                the new one and stop supporting the old one. So we migrate to the new version,&#13;
&#13;
                which doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have these those modifications we made. We have to redo it all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  82&#13;
&amp;#12;                on the new version and it takes us six months of time to do. The more we&#13;
&#13;
                modify the vendor product, the more we have this problem that every time the&#13;
&#13;
                new version comes along, we have to redo the work. It interferes with our&#13;
&#13;
                ability to implement what the vendor gives us. Furthermore, as you begin to&#13;
&#13;
                contemplate the transition from something like All-In-One into something like&#13;
&#13;
                Lotus Notes, once again, youâ&#128;&#153;re stuck because the whole Bank expects that&#13;
&#13;
                when you get this new Lotus Notes product, itâ&#128;&#153;s going to come with the same&#13;
&#13;
                facility we had with All-In-One. Where is the official mail? We have to have&#13;
&#13;
                official mail. And whereas All-In-One was the kind of an environment where&#13;
&#13;
                you could do that, you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do that in Lotus Notes even if you wanted to!&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s a bit of a trap, in a way. There is a constant tension about this kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     You canâ&#128;&#153;t get the vendor. I mean youâ&#128;&#153;re buying 12,000 items. You canâ&#128;&#153;t get&#13;
&#13;
                the vendor to make the modifications?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Not a chance. There are some 12,000 units . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       There are some things they might do, but no.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       A 12,000 unit sale on Lotus Notes is tiny. They sell 100,000 licenses to Price&#13;
&#13;
                Waterhouse or something.. The arrogance that the World Bank is accused of&#13;
&#13;
                from time to time is nowhere more manifest than in our interaction with IT&#13;
&#13;
                vendors. We tend to think that we are so special and historically speaking we&#13;
&#13;
                have had treatment from the vendors out of all proportion to the amount of&#13;
&#13;
                money that we pay them. I am thunderstruck by the attention and the special&#13;
&#13;
                treatment, which we demand and get from the vendors. We had trouble with our&#13;
&#13;
                Digital boxes in the middle of this All-In-One stuff. I demanded they replace&#13;
&#13;
                the computer and put a new one in for free. And they did it!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   83&#13;
&amp;#12;Dr. Becker:     Weâ&#128;&#153;re back from our break and Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to turn to the Enterprise Network. In&#13;
&#13;
                1992, the Bank undertook a major project to develop an Enterprise Network and&#13;
&#13;
                provide Bank-wide IT services and infrastructure. How successful was this&#13;
&#13;
                approach and how has it progressed over the years in a) effectively enhancing&#13;
&#13;
                the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business needs and b) moving from a corporate to a global network.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me start it off. In terms of success, this project was highly successful.&#13;
&#13;
                Whatâ&#128;&#153;s not stated here is the degree of difficulties inherent in bringing this&#13;
&#13;
                about. This was not only an engineering design effort but it was also an effort&#13;
&#13;
                that involved the removal of degrees of freedom from independent actors within&#13;
&#13;
                the organization. There were a series of local area networks in operation. The&#13;
&#13;
                purpose of the Enterprise Network, at least conceptually, was to bring all of the&#13;
&#13;
                local area networks into a common framework so that you could communicate&#13;
&#13;
                in a standard way across the Bank. At one point when this effort was going on, I&#13;
&#13;
                was in the Controllers organization, where we had our own network. There&#13;
&#13;
                were also Macintoshes in operation on this network within the Controllers.       It&#13;
&#13;
                was a political as well as a technical problem to bring this together. This was&#13;
&#13;
                not just a technology problem that was imposed by a central organization; this&#13;
&#13;
                was a coordination negotiation process.         The Enterprise Network, sales,&#13;
&#13;
                marketing, whatever labels you want to put on it, this was sales at a retail basis.&#13;
&#13;
                Retail almost to the extent you were at department and vice presidential unit.&#13;
&#13;
                And there were 20 of these in the Bank. It was not a simple process. LAC was&#13;
&#13;
                the guinea pig, if you will, to prove the concept from a technical standpoint and&#13;
&#13;
                there was a willing audience there. There were not necessarily willing partners&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                84&#13;
&amp;#12;                throughout the Bank This took several years to bring it all together. It is now&#13;
&#13;
                together. People forget the past, of the independent kind of activities going on&#13;
&#13;
                and so it was organizational change, technology integration and the changing&#13;
&#13;
                technology as we move along this time spectrum. So the Enterprise Network&#13;
&#13;
                was not a single static technology environment because you now had multiple&#13;
&#13;
                versions of the Enterprise Network (EN). We are now up to ED3. It started out&#13;
&#13;
                as ED, what was it version 1.05 or 1.01?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It started with EN 1.01, 1.02, 1.03 came in relatively quick succession. 1.03 was&#13;
&#13;
                the one we piloted in LAC and then there was a version 1.04 which was done in&#13;
&#13;
                LAC and ITF. Then 1.05 was the first one released Bank-wide.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Right now itâ&#128;&#153;s taken for granted itâ&#128;&#153;s a part of the background. Everyone just&#13;
&#13;
                assumes that The Enterprise Network is there and it operates. Itâ&#128;&#153;s highly visible.&#13;
&#13;
                If there is a problem with the network, everybody knows it.          One of the&#13;
&#13;
                engineering issues was to somehow structure this in a way so that you could&#13;
&#13;
                minimize total blackouts, if you will. That has been done. To most people the&#13;
&#13;
                network means things that they take for granted.        Itâ&#128;&#153;s the communications&#13;
&#13;
                infrastructure thatâ&#128;&#153;s there, that most people donâ&#128;&#153;t even think about. You turn&#13;
&#13;
                your PC on, itâ&#128;&#153;s automatically connected and you communicate.             Itâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
&#13;
                standardized desktop cell. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the image, the standard image that is on each of&#13;
&#13;
                the desktops. From an engineering standpoint, I think the ED3 probably took a&#13;
&#13;
                little bit longer than three months mentioned by Dee.         There was also a&#13;
&#13;
                negotiation process because the last time around IFC was brought into this. IFC&#13;
&#13;
                had its own image, previously.     They were not a part of the standard Bank&#13;
&#13;
                image. So ED3 covers now the Bank as well as the IFC. So itâ&#128;&#153;s not just&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               85&#13;
&amp;#12;                technical. The people side of this is also a major, major factor. From a success&#13;
&#13;
                standpoint â&#128;&#147; and we donâ&#128;&#153;t celebrate success in the Bank very well â&#128;&#147; this is a&#13;
&#13;
                major success. And itâ&#128;&#153;s not recognized. Itâ&#128;&#153;s recognized within the technology&#13;
&#13;
                community, within ISG, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t think itâ&#128;&#153;s recognized within the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And you think that itâ&#128;&#153;s going to help move the Bank from a corporate to a global&#13;
&#13;
                network?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think it has. Right now, the bulk of the Enterprise Network is thought to be in&#13;
&#13;
                downtown Washington, DC.           But the Global Network extends this EN&#13;
&#13;
                worldwide. At one point I was visiting some of the resident missions â&#128;&#147; country&#13;
&#13;
                offices â&#128;&#147; in Africa (this was shortly after the implementation of the satellite&#13;
&#13;
                network covering the Africa and LAC regions) and we installed the-then version&#13;
&#13;
                of the Enterprise Network desktop. This was in â&#128;&#153;98, I believe. They now had&#13;
&#13;
                the same capabilities as people in Headquarters had. In terms of the time&#13;
&#13;
                difference this was an integrating activity from the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s standpoint. The&#13;
&#13;
                people in these country offices felt more a part of the Bank as a result of being&#13;
&#13;
                connected by a satellite network and having the same hardware and software on&#13;
&#13;
                their desktops.    Simple things, the Global Network was not just the data&#13;
&#13;
                communications side; it also incorporated voice communications. 10 years ago,&#13;
&#13;
                you had to go through an international operator to make a call from a country&#13;
&#13;
                office into Headquarters. Staff now pick up the telephone on their desk, dial&#13;
&#13;
                directly, and connect to a counterpart in Headquarters and vice versa. That plus&#13;
&#13;
                videoconferencing brought people closer. Some of the comments I heard were:&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;I feel like Iâ&#128;&#153;m more part of the organizationâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;m better connected to staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                in Headquarters.â&#128;? I think the network had a major impact and I think going&#13;
&#13;
                forward this is going to be the assumed mode of operation.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I even, in a way, have a little bit of difficulty talking about the EN from this&#13;
&#13;
                great big high level because itâ&#128;&#153;s such a rich topic to me. Let me start by saying&#13;
&#13;
                some things about terminology. One of the difficulties weâ&#128;&#153;ve had right from the&#13;
&#13;
                beginning is that the word Enterprise Network means so many different things to&#13;
&#13;
                so many different people. We tend to use this as an umbrella term to capture a&#13;
&#13;
                lot of different meanings. One is the infrastructure put in place. I talked earlier&#13;
&#13;
                about trying to bridge the gap between the Token Ring and Ethernet and moving&#13;
&#13;
                eventually totally to Ethernet within the Bank. There is the backbone and the&#13;
&#13;
                building networks and router and switches and all sorts of technical gismos&#13;
&#13;
                necessary in order to lay the foundation so that every office is connected to&#13;
&#13;
                everything else around the world. In one sense thatâ&#128;&#153;s the Enterprise Network.&#13;
&#13;
                Tthere is second sense which the Enterprise Network uses, which is the term for&#13;
&#13;
                the standardization as it appears through the glass tube. The recognition that&#13;
&#13;
                everybody comes to the electronic world in the Bank through the tube in front of&#13;
&#13;
                their face. They think Information Technology is; this tube.&#13;
&#13;
                Trying the arrange for that to appear the same to everyone with everything that&#13;
&#13;
                this implies includes not only the engineering work that has to go on, but the&#13;
&#13;
                also training of the people and their expectations. What it will mean if I move&#13;
&#13;
                from one office to another. There are even the issues about personal liberty.&#13;
&#13;
                We have people who come from outside accustomed to being able to manage&#13;
&#13;
                their technology environment. They then discover that we wonâ&#128;&#153;t let them install&#13;
&#13;
                thus and such a piece of software. You have to ask somebody to do it for you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                87&#13;
&amp;#12;                Itâ&#128;&#153;s a both cultural phenomenon and an engineering phenomenon Third is the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network as a technical set of technical services, file and print&#13;
&#13;
                services. In that context the Enterprise Network is really a different thing than&#13;
&#13;
                say the Global Network that George has talked about. The guys who build the&#13;
&#13;
                global satellite network would probably be resistant to the idea that the word&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network ought to be applied to the DAMA network. They tend to&#13;
&#13;
                think of the Enterprise Network as the stuff thatâ&#128;&#153;s delivered up the hall. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                the file and print services and stuff like that and we, down at this end of the hall,&#13;
&#13;
                we deliver the Global Network.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Terminologically, from the point of view of business managers around the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
                maybe they would say the Enterprise Network is the place where all the&#13;
&#13;
                applications are and is the foundation for delivery of applications. Perhaps this&#13;
&#13;
                is the important definition of what the Enterprise Network is to the Bank. In that&#13;
&#13;
                regard the Enterprise Network has been very successful at helping us to make it&#13;
&#13;
                possible to put applications in place. Remember the four different technical&#13;
&#13;
                environments or the seven different protocol detectors families that we had&#13;
&#13;
                before we started this work. (Incidentally, I would say, we started in â&#128;&#153;91 rather&#13;
&#13;
                than â&#128;&#153;92 but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t announce it to the Bank until 1992.)             We started&#13;
&#13;
                informally today by talking about the fact that todayâ&#128;&#153;s edition of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                World Today electronic newsletter recalls that on November 4, 1992, â&#128;&#156;ITF&#13;
&#13;
                announces plans for the Enterprise Network to all staff.â&#128;? We in ISG would&#13;
&#13;
                probably tend to regard this as a separate project, something called Desktop&#13;
&#13;
                Reform. From the perspective of Bank customers, Desktop Reform is all part&#13;
&#13;
                and parcel of the Enterprise Network. But to us, this is a very different thing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  88&#13;
&amp;#12;                that was itself a very major, massive effort toward the direction of increased&#13;
&#13;
                standardization. This was the effort that was begun in â&#128;&#153;97 to â&#128;&#147; over a three-year&#13;
&#13;
                phased period â&#128;&#147; replace all the equipment and change the way the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                manages the delivery of the desktop environment. We have mentioned that&#13;
&#13;
                office technology was different from information technology, in the way it came&#13;
&#13;
                into the Bank and in the way it was a decentralized phenomenon â&#128;&#147; Desktop&#13;
&#13;
                Reform was the first time that the Bank had recognized and decided to manage&#13;
&#13;
                that kind of technology as a corporate resource.      It was a recognition that&#13;
&#13;
                computers are provided corporately to individuals in order to do work but it is a&#13;
&#13;
                corporate computer. We stopped calling it a personal computer with desktop&#13;
&#13;
                reform and started calling it the Corporate Computer Program. You donâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
&#13;
                an entitlement to have a piece of technology to do anything you want with. It is&#13;
&#13;
                supplied by the Bank in order to deliver applications, in order to enable you to&#13;
&#13;
                interact with the corporate system, which occurs in a controlled environment&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Shifting from the corporate resource, let me add one thing on this. One of the&#13;
&#13;
                transitions and one of the concerns at one point was that previously the desktop&#13;
&#13;
                computer was a computer that you just turned it on and it was on. The log-in&#13;
&#13;
                process was one thing. Now we have whatâ&#128;&#153;s called a â&#128;&#156;locked down desktop.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                You have to enter your password in order to get into this machine. Previously&#13;
&#13;
                that was not the case and that was a part of increasing control and security. It&#13;
&#13;
                was also something that came with the next version of the operating system, the&#13;
&#13;
                NT Operating System that was one of the progressions in this aspect of control,&#13;
&#13;
                if you will. Perceived centralized control, not being able to do everything that&#13;
&#13;
                you could do previously.       When the shift to NT came in, there was some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               89&#13;
&amp;#12;                concern in the Information Technology Services department as to how would&#13;
&#13;
                people react to having this locked down desktop? It would automatically lock&#13;
&#13;
                itself if you were inactive so you had to log on again. Now itâ&#128;&#153;s taken for granted&#13;
&#13;
                but it was a concern because this was shift from an environment in which there&#13;
&#13;
                was essentially more freedom.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you consider this to be useful for completeness but I just thought&#13;
&#13;
                I would run through the timing of this. We started working on the so-called&#13;
&#13;
                EN1.01 in 1991. There was an IMTPC meeting in late 1991 in which we agreed&#13;
&#13;
                that we would do this.       In the latter part of â&#128;&#153;91 and early â&#128;&#153;92, we were&#13;
&#13;
                negotiating with George over in PBD for the money to do it. Meanwhile, we&#13;
&#13;
                were actively engaged in trying to engineer some of the early stuff and in&#13;
&#13;
                building the infrastructure. Early on we got LAC to agree to be the pilot so the&#13;
&#13;
                sort of EN1.01 was something that was only in the laboratory.         We actually&#13;
&#13;
                tried to take something called EN1.02 over to LAC but it was a dismal failure.&#13;
&#13;
                We totally underestimated the degree of work to make palatable for end users.&#13;
&#13;
                It was way too technical. LAC was very patient with us and very helpful. Steve&#13;
&#13;
                Ball and Mary Jane Bullen, in particular, were our counterparts in LAC. They&#13;
&#13;
                were very patient with us because we were technologists trying to do this.&#13;
&#13;
                Another point about that early version was that we were initially trying to do this&#13;
&#13;
                entirely with the TCP/IP UNIX kinds of things. After EN1.02 we realized that&#13;
&#13;
                we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t do this, that we were going to have to use some commercial LAN&#13;
&#13;
                environment to provide some of the services because those companies â&#128;&#147; and Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
                talking here about companies like Novell and Banyan â&#128;&#147; had spent millions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                90&#13;
&amp;#12;                millions of dollars trying to make it possible for technologically unsophisticated&#13;
&#13;
                end users to use these things and to use these services.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Make them more user-friendly?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes. There was just no way that we could reproduce that work and make it&#13;
&#13;
                UNIX based services user-friendly for Bank staff members. We had to use&#13;
&#13;
                something, which caused a great deal of tension inside ISG, well ITF, in those&#13;
&#13;
                days. If we were going to use a commercial product, was it going to be Banyan&#13;
&#13;
                or Novell or was it going to be the DEC product, which was called Pathworks?&#13;
&#13;
                The advantage of the DEC product was that if offered a great deal of better&#13;
&#13;
                interaction with All-In-One. All-In-One was still the primary vehicle that most&#13;
&#13;
                people used their computer for. That and document preparation. The question&#13;
&#13;
                we agonized about for quite some time was: were we going to abandon Banyan&#13;
&#13;
                Vines and move to Pathworks, which was a whole different kind of local area&#13;
&#13;
                network for which we had neither expertise nor staff trained to use it.          I&#13;
&#13;
                remember Patty Hamsher saying â&#128;&#156;People say that weâ&#128;&#153;re being driven by All-In-&#13;
&#13;
                One and that we have the tail wagging the dog but they fail to understand All-In-&#13;
&#13;
                One is the dogâ&#128;?. Now of course, we all got a lot of fun out of â&#128;&#156;All-In-One is the&#13;
&#13;
                dogâ&#128;?. We made the decision that by golly we were going to go for Pathworks.&#13;
&#13;
                That decision percolated up to Hywel and he made it.       There then ensued an&#13;
&#13;
                effort that went on for six months to try to make this thing work with Pathworks&#13;
&#13;
                on EN1.03 and it didnâ&#128;&#153;t. We could not make this work. We had to go back to&#13;
&#13;
                Banyan and EN1.04, which was a real setback in the engineering and loss of&#13;
&#13;
                time    EN1.04 was piloted in LAC. There was a group of people convened to&#13;
&#13;
                assess the pilot and try to do a cost-benefit analysis on whether or not this was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               91&#13;
&amp;#12;                something we should go forward with This was into â&#128;&#153;94 before we did that.&#13;
&#13;
                After having done the pilots and towards the end of 1994, the Bank experienced&#13;
&#13;
                the scandal with the main complex retrofit.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Hywel Davies was relieved of his command. There was a lot of concern in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank if the main complex retrofit was in some way in trouble, did it mean that&#13;
&#13;
                all of the other things that ITF was doing were equally suspicious? There was a&#13;
&#13;
                lot of suspicion already about the Enterprise Network project because it looked&#13;
&#13;
                like it would cost a lot of money and take a long time to do. At the end of â&#128;&#153;94,&#13;
&#13;
                when the pilot was completed, the Enterprise Network project was put on hold.&#13;
&#13;
                We had already lost time because of this shift in the technology but then we lost&#13;
&#13;
                I would say another whole year when the main complex retrofit scandal erupted&#13;
&#13;
                and the sequence of management changes went on. First Mr. Wessels was asked&#13;
&#13;
                to take the lead as an interim Director for ITF.&#13;
&#13;
Actually ITF was first put under Roger Di Paolo and Mr. Rajagopalan for a short period of&#13;
&#13;
                time. And then Everado Wessels for the remainder of that year, which was for&#13;
&#13;
                several months.     At the end of â&#128;&#153;94, the Organization and Business Practices&#13;
&#13;
                Department was formed, within a new VPU under the management of Shahid&#13;
&#13;
                Husain, who had been the VP in LAC with whom we had interacted with on the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network. The difficulty was that Shahid was impatient about the&#13;
&#13;
                length of time the project was taking, the amount of money being spent, and the&#13;
&#13;
                number of staff involved. He was suspicious because this was just technology&#13;
&#13;
                stuff. I remember he had a meeting with the senior staff of ITF and they went&#13;
&#13;
                around the room. And different people would talk about what they were doing&#13;
&#13;
                and one person after another would say, â&#128;&#156;Well, Iâ&#128;&#153;m doing this on the Enterprise&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                Network, Iâ&#128;&#153;m doing that on the Enterprise Network and Iâ&#128;&#153;m doing this on the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Networkâ&#128;?. This went all around the room and I remember sitting&#13;
&#13;
                there thinking to myself, â&#128;&#156;God, he must be feeling like everybody in this whole&#13;
&#13;
                place is working on the Enterprise Networkâ&#128;?. And Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure thatâ&#128;&#153;s exactly what&#13;
&#13;
                he was feeling so this whole thing got put on hold after the pilot and we were&#13;
&#13;
                into July of â&#128;&#153;95 â&#128;&#147; let me see, am I off by a year? I think July of â&#128;&#153;95 . .Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying&#13;
&#13;
                to remember when OBP was formed. I think OBP was formed at the end of â&#128;&#153;94&#13;
&#13;
                if I have this right. And the MCRP scandal was in â&#128;&#153;94, right?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       It was in 1993. The MCRP blew up during the period of time when I was in&#13;
&#13;
                PBD.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to remember when the Enterprise Network was put on hold and when&#13;
&#13;
                it was resurrected. I believe that it was resurrected in July of â&#128;&#153;95. Mohamed&#13;
&#13;
                Muhsin was brought to OBP in the late summer of â&#128;&#153;95 as Deputy Director of&#13;
&#13;
                OBP under Ian Scott with the specific task of deploying the Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
                Network.. But it was Shahid Husain who brought him in. When Mohamed&#13;
&#13;
                Muhsin first came, Ian Scott, like everybody else, was not sure that we should&#13;
&#13;
                go ahead with the Enterprise Network. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t know what it was; he needed&#13;
&#13;
                to be convinced and he brought in some outside consultants. Mohamed then set&#13;
&#13;
                about to deliver and install it across the whole Bank. I was the guy in charge of&#13;
&#13;
                the group doing the engineering and pilot work. As we approached the end of&#13;
&#13;
                that work, we started to confront some of the issues of trying to deploy across&#13;
&#13;
                the whole Bank. I had dealt with one level of political issue among the technical&#13;
&#13;
                community, but when we got to the point where we were dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
                politics at the departmental and vice-presidential level, around the money, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 93&#13;
&amp;#12;                was a different set of issues. If the MCRP blow up had not occurred and the&#13;
&#13;
                project not stopped and Mohamed Muhsin not been brought in, it would have&#13;
&#13;
                been a whole different thing. Because I could never have done what he did.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Was Ian Scottâ&#128;&#153;s concern about cost or technical feasibility or . . . ?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The combination of cost and benefits and what was it really going to do. I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                think technical feasibility was something that he worried about. It was cost-&#13;
&#13;
                benefit, which was difficult for us to articulate. This was infrastructure, you see.&#13;
&#13;
                And itâ&#128;&#153;s always hard to explain to people. Perhaps itâ&#128;&#153;s easy now to look back&#13;
&#13;
                and say, â&#128;&#156;by 1998, â&#128;&#153;99, weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to deploy SAP on an infrastructure in which&#13;
&#13;
                everybody has a workstation more or less standardized                thatâ&#128;&#153;s network&#13;
&#13;
                connectedâ&#128;?.    There is no way we could have delivered systems, corporate&#13;
&#13;
                systems, on a thousand different flavors of computer and a thousand different&#13;
&#13;
                configurations on seven different network architectures and four different&#13;
&#13;
                technical environments. And yet how do you explain to the managers in 1994 â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                before there even is an ERP â&#128;&#147; that we have to do this foundation if weâ&#128;&#153;re even&#13;
&#13;
                going to be able to go that next step and connect the systems together? I started&#13;
&#13;
                using this model Iâ&#128;&#153;ve used over and over again about the chasm between OT and&#13;
&#13;
                IT.&#13;
&#13;
                The systems environment is all in this IT space. We need to build corporate&#13;
&#13;
                systems and yet every staff member is being equipped with office technology&#13;
&#13;
                thatâ&#128;&#153;s got Word and WordPerfect and Excel on it. We are joining these two&#13;
&#13;
                environments together. The Enterprise network is merging IT and OT, making&#13;
&#13;
                it possible for someone to sit at their desk and to be able to get at all of the&#13;
&#13;
                information. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting was that at the time when weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 94&#13;
&amp;#12;                explain this to people, the World Wide Web doesnâ&#128;&#153;t even exist. Once you&#13;
&#13;
                experience the World Wide Web you understand networking. But before that&#13;
&#13;
                existed, it was just way too technical to try to explain to people why it was&#13;
&#13;
                important for us to do this.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       What they saw, I think was that this was a removal of degrees of freedom that&#13;
&#13;
                they had in their local environment. I was in the Controllers and we had our&#13;
&#13;
                local area network set up. We have our own kind of configurations. We have&#13;
&#13;
                our own technology support staff supporting this organizational unit. And yes&#13;
&#13;
                we are connected into a broader kind of Bank network, but not fully. The&#13;
&#13;
                Controllers had Pathworks as their network. There was a mixed environment of&#13;
&#13;
                Macintoshes and PCs. . One of my jobs was to bring a more uniform&#13;
&#13;
                environment to Controllers. I was actually the major decision-maker that said,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;The Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s organization will go onto the Enterprise Network.â&#128;? But the&#13;
&#13;
                EN was not viewed as access to institutional applications. The Vice-Presidential&#13;
&#13;
                Units viewed EN more as a limitation and of having to conform to an&#13;
&#13;
                institutional standard as opposed to a local standard, which was under local&#13;
&#13;
                control&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So politically it must have been very difficult; an uphill battle.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The political environment was also complicated by the budget, because the&#13;
&#13;
                background here was chargeback. We had our technology staff supporting our&#13;
&#13;
                local network and weâ&#128;&#153;re now going to be brought into the Enterprise Network. I&#13;
&#13;
                understand that the only thing that was going back to the Center at that point in&#13;
&#13;
                time from the desktop was $34 a month or $32 a month for All-In-One.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, no, youâ&#128;&#153;re also paying for the network connection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              95&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       And the network connection.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We were talking about $78 a month to be on the Enterprise Network. People in&#13;
&#13;
                Controllers and other places were saying, â&#128;&#156;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve already bought my local area&#13;
&#13;
                network. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got my Banyan thing, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got my Token Ring and Iâ&#128;&#153;m connected&#13;
&#13;
                to that and what are you going to give me, besides what I already have?â&#128;? And&#13;
&#13;
                the answer was, â&#128;&#156;Not very damn much in the short term. In the long term weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                going to blow you away but in the short term weâ&#128;&#153;ve got to put this in place&#13;
&#13;
                before we can even begin to build the systems. Also we will give you the&#13;
&#13;
                Internet.â&#128;? And the response sometimes was, â&#128;&#156;Well, what do I care about the&#13;
&#13;
                Internet?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a lack of technical understanding. Also it had implications on limiting&#13;
&#13;
                what you could do, or go forward with. OK, weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about corporate&#13;
&#13;
                networking here, but what was happening in global networking?              Did that&#13;
&#13;
                hamper your efforts there?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, the original project plan called for us to go global with the EN, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West        Weâ&#128;&#153;re still a little ways away from that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The concepts on the Global Network began in â&#128;&#153;96.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Because previously what existed were individual connections. From a technical&#13;
&#13;
                standpoint it was point-to-point connections. There was a country office; there&#13;
&#13;
                was Headquarters. You were connecting a country office into Headquarters and&#13;
&#13;
                then you had communication between those two points. We evolved in a couple&#13;
&#13;
                of ways when satellite communications entered into this thing. Basically, the&#13;
&#13;
                Regions were interested in communicating with their country offices. But that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                    96&#13;
&amp;#12;                was still point-to-point. Satellite technology gave us the concept of a regional&#13;
&#13;
                network. This got into what was called mesh connectivity which allowed you&#13;
&#13;
                not only to communicate with Headquarters but to communicate with another&#13;
&#13;
                field office directly. Now that could be done through the telephone but data&#13;
&#13;
                communications was not yet a part of this. We still had the connections to the&#13;
&#13;
                country offices but not this concept of connecting satellite networks together.&#13;
&#13;
                We had the DAMA network in Africa and LAC; the Orion network for ECA,&#13;
&#13;
                and the Asia Regional Network. Those are all connected now into a global&#13;
&#13;
                network. Mr. Wolfensohn can broadcast the annual speech to all the country&#13;
&#13;
                offices. This was not yet the case in the time period that weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about&#13;
&#13;
                before 1995. People were starting to see that the silo applications had their&#13;
&#13;
                problems, which showed up in information. From an information standpoint&#13;
&#13;
                different answers were produced for the same question. Because of people going&#13;
&#13;
                to different databases, different time periods,    and using slightly different&#13;
&#13;
                definitions.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Outside of the technical people was, who had the vision or who saw the&#13;
&#13;
                possibilities of this network?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The Enterprise Network? This quantum leap occurred in â&#128;&#153;96 with the move to&#13;
&#13;
                DAMA. But there had been flailing about on this attempt to implement some&#13;
&#13;
                communication capabilities with country offices going back to â&#128;&#153;92. There were&#13;
&#13;
                these IMTPC meetings where attempts to persuade people to make money&#13;
&#13;
                available addressed the same issue in infrastructure as with the Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
                Network. How do we pay for it? Whoâ&#128;&#153;s going to pay for it? It needs to be a&#13;
&#13;
                corporate decision, rather than an individual unit decision. Between â&#128;&#153;92 and â&#128;&#153;95&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             97&#13;
&amp;#12;                or â&#128;&#153;96, all we were able to do was implement links in cases where we could&#13;
&#13;
                displace an existing voice network at lower cost. If we had a big field office,&#13;
&#13;
                like Nairobi or Jakarta, we could put in a link, a dedicated link, in whether it was&#13;
&#13;
                satellite, or fiber, or whatever it was, whatever was available, because we could&#13;
&#13;
                pay for it by the savings in voice traffic.. We put the Jakarta link in â&#128;&#153;88,&#13;
&#13;
                actually. If there were lot of telephone traffic and a lot of long-distance bills, we&#13;
&#13;
                could put a link in which would lower their long-distance bill, because of the&#13;
&#13;
                installation of a dedicated circuit. We could put four or five voice channels&#13;
&#13;
                across the circuit. The savings in long distance would pay for the link and that&#13;
&#13;
                would give us the data link.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       But it was only the big offices where we could do that. And it really wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the&#13;
&#13;
                big offices where we had the big problem. As Dee was talking earlier about his&#13;
&#13;
                visit to Africa later on, we could really revolutionize the way they did their&#13;
&#13;
                work. We agonized from â&#128;&#153;92 up until â&#128;&#153;95, â&#128;&#153;96 trying to find some way to explain&#13;
&#13;
                what the benefits of this were and cost-justify the kind of investment that was&#13;
&#13;
                necessary to put some kind of capability in place. And it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until the&#13;
&#13;
                DAMA network existed that we were able to solve that, to crack that nut. Weâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
&#13;
                get there I guess later on, because that occurs later on.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Outside of the technical people, whoâ&#128;&#153;s the visionary? Who do you think is the&#13;
&#13;
                visionary? Who saw the possibilities of the network?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       In all modesty, Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to decide whether I qualify as the . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Youâ&#128;&#153;re the technical person, yes.        Weâ&#128;&#153;re talking non-technical within the&#13;
&#13;
                hierarchy. Who bought into this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  98&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Well, Hywel, of course, was the Director who saw it. And he enlisted the power&#13;
&#13;
                of Ernie Stern. Ernie may not have understood what we were doing or why we&#13;
&#13;
                were doing it but he trusted Hywel. Hywel said, â&#128;&#156;I need you to back thisâ&#128;? and&#13;
&#13;
                Ernie said, â&#128;&#156;OK, youâ&#128;&#153;ll get the moneyâ&#128;?. Now, whether Ernieâ&#128;&#153;s saying to Hywel&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;youâ&#128;&#153;ll get the moneyâ&#128;? actually translated into anybody in PBD believing that&#13;
&#13;
                we needed to do this, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know that that actually worked. We were still&#13;
&#13;
                jumping through hoops with George. Of course George and various people in&#13;
&#13;
                PBD bought into to it on a conceptual level what we wanted to do and why we&#13;
&#13;
                wanted to do it. But we â&#128;&#147; all of us â&#128;&#147; still needed to adhere to the discipline of&#13;
&#13;
                preparing a plan and writing the cost-benefit to justify it. It was very hard&#13;
&#13;
                because the benefits were going to occur downstream from subsequent&#13;
&#13;
                investments. We werenâ&#128;&#153;t going to get any real direct cost savings out of doing&#13;
&#13;
                this nor any measurable benefits from laying down infrastructure. You were&#13;
&#13;
                going to get benefits from the things you could put on top of the infrastructure. I&#13;
&#13;
                would say in the end it became almost a leap of faith. Would you agree with&#13;
&#13;
                that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes. What Mohamed Muhsin was able to do when he came into this was to&#13;
&#13;
                bridge the gap on the cost effectiveness by cutting a deal, if you will, with PBD&#13;
&#13;
                to have the institution absorb a portion of the costs.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Temporarily, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Temporarily. I mean there was a future bill to be paid. But in the initial stages&#13;
&#13;
                the pill that you had to swallow from a cost standpoint was made a little bit&#13;
&#13;
                smaller.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                99&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Good point.       Very imaginative, Mohamed Muhsinâ&#128;&#153;s approach.               This&#13;
&#13;
                encapsulates his entire history: â&#128;&#156;He found a way. He always finds a wayâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       He saw that this was a concern and the way to overcome that concern. The&#13;
&#13;
                organizational units had to buy into this across the board, that is agree. Even&#13;
&#13;
                with this agreement considerable work remained. To make documents available&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#147; all of the documents that had to be scanned â&#128;&#147; then they were made available to&#13;
&#13;
                people via the Enterprise Network. The Bank reports then became available by&#13;
&#13;
                the Enterprise Network, which was just a part of your basic cost. Now, it was&#13;
&#13;
                not full cost recovery by any stretch of the imagination but it was a service that&#13;
&#13;
                became available to everyone in the Bank.        Even in the early days of the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network there were large numbers of documents that became&#13;
&#13;
                electronically available.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And then that builds a constituency as people begin to see the value of this kind&#13;
&#13;
                of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       One of the things that really helped us turn the corner was the introduction of&#13;
&#13;
                Mosaic in â&#128;&#153;93. By â&#128;&#153;94, the World Wide Web began to have a serious impact in&#13;
&#13;
                the world at large. The World Bank was on the web pretty early, both internally&#13;
&#13;
                and externally. Our early Intranet was pretty good. Everybody will remember&#13;
&#13;
                the blue, the blue bars and the picture that changed every time you went into the&#13;
&#13;
                web. It came in for a lot of criticism from different people but I thought it was&#13;
&#13;
                quite good as a first effort (and I say that as someone who had nothing to do&#13;
&#13;
                with it).&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       One of the other things from an Internet access standpoint that helped us was&#13;
&#13;
                universal access. Not so much now, but a year or two ago, people would ask,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              100&#13;
&amp;#12;                â&#128;&#156;does everyone within the organization have access to the Internet?â&#128;? Everyone&#13;
&#13;
                in the Bank from day one, when it was made available, had Intranet access. this&#13;
&#13;
                was a kind of a corporate policy vis-Ã -vis access to external information.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       This was a very interesting decision process. As we go along I got out of it for a&#13;
&#13;
                while and Mohamed Muhsin delivered. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what kinds of dialogue&#13;
&#13;
                took place after my time, but I was very aware that if I ask the senior&#13;
&#13;
                bureaucracy of the Bank any of these questions, I will get answers that I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                like and donâ&#128;&#153;t believe in. So Iâ&#128;&#153;m not going to ask. And I may someday get fired&#13;
&#13;
                for having done this or done but the right thing to do is provide the Internet to&#13;
&#13;
                everyone. I actually was even more Libertarian than we ended up being. In the&#13;
&#13;
                end we did do some censorship of some stuff. News groups associated with&#13;
&#13;
                games or sex or any of that stuff were not made available on the internal&#13;
&#13;
                network. I heard that Shahid Husain got involved in access issues early on after&#13;
&#13;
                I was out of it. At the beginning we decided, right from the get go, that we&#13;
&#13;
                would make all of this stuff available to everyone. We weren't going to try to&#13;
&#13;
                figure out who could have access to the Internet and who couldnâ&#128;&#153;t and/or could&#13;
&#13;
                do any of that stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Organizational changes or fine tunings were frequent throughout the â&#128;&#153;90s. From the&#13;
&#13;
                mid-â&#128;&#153;90s onwards, the Bank became increasingly more decentralized administratively&#13;
&#13;
                and geographically.     Please discuss the effects on the management of information&#13;
&#13;
                technology in supporting the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s changing business needs. For instance, the ability&#13;
&#13;
                to communicate electronically both internally and externally and the demand for robust,&#13;
&#13;
                global communication network linkages. And the role of the Bank as information&#13;
&#13;
                provider as its products are highly information intensive and worldwide in character,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              101&#13;
&amp;#12;                leading to more exploitation of its documents and data and a demand for better tools to&#13;
&#13;
                do so, e.g. multiplicity of databases, data interfaces, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, we have I think a propitious blending of technological capabilities and&#13;
&#13;
                organizational directions.         The ability to implement communications&#13;
&#13;
                infrastructure on a global basis matches very closely this decentralization. The&#13;
&#13;
                implementation of the global network via satellites and the integration of those&#13;
&#13;
                networks. That comes within a two-to-three year period of time. The DAMA&#13;
&#13;
                network is the first. Not that we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have point-to-point communications&#13;
&#13;
                with the country offices but now we have the ability to treat those from a&#13;
&#13;
                regional and more of a letâ&#128;&#153;s say a global basis than we did before.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think you should stop and define the DAMA network and the MOU and all of&#13;
&#13;
                that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West        DAMA is Demand Assigned Multiple Access. It was implemented in the military and&#13;
&#13;
                was a proven technology. We also had discovered at that time that as a result of the&#13;
&#13;
                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s status as an international organization, a specialized agency of the UN, that we&#13;
&#13;
                could have signatory capabilities under the Intelsat kind of arrangements which allowed&#13;
&#13;
                us to obtain concessional rates on satellite transponder capacity via our link through the&#13;
&#13;
                UN. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was our agreement with the United&#13;
&#13;
                Nations that we would exercise some of the entitlements which the UN had under the&#13;
&#13;
                international agreements which created IntelSAT.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What year would you say this is?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This is in the â&#128;&#153;90, â&#128;&#153;95, â&#128;&#153;96 period of time. We made arrangements with the UN&#13;
&#13;
                and signed an agreement with them that allows us to obtain transponder&#13;
&#13;
                capacity. Intelsat had excess capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               102&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Think of it this way, the Intelsat is an international consortium at the time agreed&#13;
&#13;
                to by all the governments. There was a provision in Intelsatâ&#128;&#153;s charter that the&#13;
&#13;
                United Nations in its role as a peace-keeping force would have access to&#13;
&#13;
                bandwidth with, Intelsat band width. And so, always, from the formation of&#13;
&#13;
                Intelsat there was an ability for the UN to get access. But the UN never used it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, they did use it for some peace-keeping operations.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, OK. But they made very little use of it, then. And it was Vili Brajoviec, I&#13;
&#13;
                guess, who discovered . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Actually a consultant, John Tierney â&#128;&#147; who had worked at the UN and who then&#13;
&#13;
                worked for us and is still working at the Bank as a consultant with the&#13;
&#13;
                communications technology staff made us aware of this. There were two kinds&#13;
&#13;
                of hurdles here. One was actually not a hurdle but made it much more attractive&#13;
&#13;
                from a cost effectiveness standpoint, i.e., getting the concessional rates. The&#13;
&#13;
                other hurdle, which had been recognized earlier on, was that in order to operate&#13;
&#13;
                a satellite ground station communications facility within a country you had to&#13;
&#13;
                have the permission of the country to install this facility. There had been some&#13;
&#13;
                not-so-successful attempts earlier on to get agreements with countries to&#13;
&#13;
                implement what was then called VSAT terminology technology â&#128;&#147; Very Small&#13;
&#13;
                Aperture Terminal technology â&#128;&#147; basically the satellite communication. We had&#13;
&#13;
                the DAMA network with the UN Intelsat low cost, combined with a need for&#13;
&#13;
                communications, a business need in Africa where there was very poor local&#13;
&#13;
                communications infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Small offices, not big.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Some, a few are big.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                103&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       We cherry-picked the big ones. Meaning: for the large offices with lots of voice&#13;
&#13;
                traffic, we were able to cost justify obtaining dedicated terrestrial links, as&#13;
&#13;
                mentioned before, on the basis of savings in voice expenses. But this technique&#13;
&#13;
                would only work for offices large enough to be experiencing a substantial&#13;
&#13;
                amount of voice telephone expense.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, a few big offices but most of them are small. We have a satellite that&#13;
&#13;
                covers both Latin America and Africa and also going up a little bit into the&#13;
&#13;
                Middle East. We now have a potential for implementing a satellite network that&#13;
&#13;
                will give us communications into Central and South America, Africa and a little&#13;
&#13;
                bit in the Middle East. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve got a real strong demand coming out of Africa,&#13;
&#13;
                but less demand in LAC. Organizationally, LAC could be considered a reluctant&#13;
&#13;
                dragon because they could contract for independent satellite connections and in&#13;
&#13;
                some cases fiber.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Or terrestrial connections.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes. At least into Mexico City there is still a terrestrial fiber link. The real&#13;
&#13;
                business demand and need is within the Africa region. It was proving the&#13;
&#13;
                technological capability, getting the UN agreement and having the sponsorship&#13;
&#13;
                from the Africa region that enabled us to connect to Africa. We also added the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network upgrade of the country offices and the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
                local area networks in these offices into our contract with the Africa region.&#13;
&#13;
                This was a major undertaking, which I actually had a part in. We signed a&#13;
&#13;
                contract with the Africa region to implement this. It was our staff supplemented&#13;
&#13;
                by some technology staff in Africa that accomplished this. An RFP was let and&#13;
&#13;
                MCI, now MCI WorldCom MCI, was contracted to do the actual physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            104&#13;
&amp;#12;                implementation of the ground stations in the countries. Missions were sent out&#13;
&#13;
                to negotiate with the governments and to obtain their permission to install these&#13;
&#13;
                ground stations. The combination of country directors, resident representatives&#13;
&#13;
                and the technology staff from the then ITS department was able to convince the&#13;
&#13;
                PTTs that this would not infringe upon their capabilities at all and would&#13;
&#13;
                actually be good for the country and good for the Bank. We said it would only&#13;
&#13;
                be used for Bank business, not competing, because we were actually taking a&#13;
&#13;
                small portion of revenue away from the PTT by doing our voice&#13;
&#13;
                communications now through the satellite and not through the PTT. So there is&#13;
&#13;
                a lot of dialogue going on here. Because the African countries had minimal&#13;
&#13;
                communications, implementing the DAMA network was a big jump in business&#13;
&#13;
                capability for them and it met a demand actually coming from the country&#13;
&#13;
                offices to Headquarters. Technologically, it worked. It was installed pretty&#13;
&#13;
                much on schedule; in fact, I remember one of our first connections was into&#13;
&#13;
                Mozambique.      Mr. Wolfensohn was then president and this was actually a&#13;
&#13;
                connection to a Distance Learning Center, which was part of the resident&#13;
&#13;
                mission.    Mr. Wolfensohn was in Montreal at the first global knowledge&#13;
&#13;
                conference there. We made a video connection from Montreal to Washington&#13;
&#13;
                and connected Washington via satellite into Mozambique. And we have the&#13;
&#13;
                Ministers in Mozambique speaking to Mr. Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       There is an interesting organizational and evolution of the culture of IT issue&#13;
&#13;
                that is important to point out. Itâ&#128;&#153;s this evolution between our having dealt&#13;
&#13;
                country-by-country in the past via point-to-point links in to the idea of using the&#13;
&#13;
                satellite that comes up in â&#128;&#153;96. I mark this as the beginning of the recognition â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               105&#13;
&amp;#12;                perhaps we should have recognized it with the Enterprise Network â&#128;&#147; but with&#13;
&#13;
                the global network we recognized finally that weâ&#128;&#153;ve moved into an era where&#13;
&#13;
                we needed corporate decision making. And this is such stark contrast in this&#13;
&#13;
                particular case because we can lay a footprint across Africa and Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
                The technology enables us to share the satellite bandwidth in such a way that&#13;
&#13;
                when Africa sleeps, LAC can use it. When LAC is not there, Africa can use it.&#13;
&#13;
                It was the only way on earth to get bandwidth into these infrastructure-poor&#13;
&#13;
                countries particularly in Central Africa, in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is no&#13;
&#13;
                other way on earth that we could communicate. We were able to do it for an&#13;
&#13;
                average cost across all of these 30 offices within our range. But one of the&#13;
&#13;
                sticking points was some of these offices in Latin America were able to get&#13;
&#13;
                terrestrial links to the United States, and at prices competitive with the average&#13;
&#13;
                rate that we were able to generate corporately. The argument was that the&#13;
&#13;
                Argentina field office can get a fiber connection back to Washington which&#13;
&#13;
                wonâ&#128;&#153;t have the satellite hop and will be as fast and as capable and will cost&#13;
&#13;
                about the same amount. Maybe less, maybe more, depending on whom you talk&#13;
&#13;
                to.&#13;
&#13;
                The important point wasnâ&#128;&#153;t whether it was more expensive or a less expensive&#13;
&#13;
                or even, more capable or less capable. The point is if as an institution we use&#13;
&#13;
                this DAMA technology across both Africa and LAC we -- the institution -- can&#13;
&#13;
                supply technology to all of our country offices. If we don't all pull together and&#13;
&#13;
                do it as a corporate entity, then yes, Argentina can do it but there is no way that&#13;
&#13;
                we can put technology into Ouagadougou.          It just canâ&#128;&#153;t happen.    Itâ&#128;&#153;s this&#13;
&#13;
                recognition â&#128;&#147; that IT is a corporate issue â&#128;&#147; thatâ&#128;&#153;s beginning towards the mid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               106&#13;
&amp;#12;                â&#128;&#153;90s. It is not an individual unit issue and we have to be able to make decisions&#13;
&#13;
                that span whole regions. We had known for five years that satellite technology&#13;
&#13;
                might be the only way we could reach Africa. But the concept of the need for a&#13;
&#13;
                corporate decision about satellites having a footprint over countries in three&#13;
&#13;
                different regions and the attempt to get decisions made about costing and budget&#13;
&#13;
                for that had been the obstacle.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting, on the budgetary side within the LAC region, in contrast to some&#13;
&#13;
                other regions, the country office budget authority was much stronger than it was&#13;
&#13;
                in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Much more entrepreneurial.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Entrepreneurial, and a lot of budgetary decision-making authority with the&#13;
&#13;
                Country Director as opposed to centrally within the Region. This was much&#13;
&#13;
                harder sell in LAC than it was in Africa. LAC had alternatives. Whereas,&#13;
&#13;
                Africa basically had nothing in the way of alternatives. This was the magic&#13;
&#13;
                bullet, if you will. A silver bullet for Africa and there were multiple weapons&#13;
&#13;
                for the LAC side.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     So you have to centralize certain technologies.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, but this was the nice marriage that I felt that the technology was allowing.&#13;
&#13;
                The centralized technology allowed the decentralized organizational direction.&#13;
&#13;
                The budgetary standpoint was that when you took this on a larger basis â&#128;&#147; the&#13;
&#13;
                regional basis â&#128;&#147; you had more ways to allocate costs and thus it made it easier to&#13;
&#13;
                handle administratively. For Africa, average costs were used. You could adjust&#13;
&#13;
                the prices depending upon the office size if you wanted to. But it was just easier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              107&#13;
&amp;#12;                to handle. This made it affordable for the small office. Whereas previously the&#13;
&#13;
                cost justification for the small office wasnâ&#128;&#153;t there as Dee has said.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We couldnâ&#128;&#153;t justify this technology on the basis of displacing the voice traffic&#13;
&#13;
                because they didnâ&#128;&#153;t make many long-distance calls. They had terrible voice&#13;
&#13;
                communications because they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get reliable connections, which meant&#13;
&#13;
                not much money was spent on voice communications. We were unable to say,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Well, theyâ&#128;&#153;re spending $7,000 a month in Ouagadougou so letâ&#128;&#153;s put in a data&#13;
&#13;
                link.â&#128;? Theyâ&#128;&#153;re not spending anything. We do some interesting comparisons&#13;
&#13;
                these days comparing what weâ&#128;&#153;re delivering and the cost weâ&#128;&#153;re providing, with&#13;
&#13;
                what the local offices would be able to get if they went to commercial providers&#13;
&#13;
                and itâ&#128;&#153;s just stunning.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       An interesting footnote on this is with the recent privatization of Intelsat, the&#13;
&#13;
                kind of concessionary signatory rates we had, transitioned into a much more&#13;
&#13;
                market-based rate structure. We still have good negotiators and hopefully the&#13;
&#13;
                market conditions will permit us to keep rates low. But the concessional rate for&#13;
&#13;
                the initial Africa/LAC satellite portion of the global network is fading, itâ&#128;&#153;s going&#13;
&#13;
                away.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Shall we break now and then can do another session and talk about the&#13;
&#13;
                exploitation of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s documents?&#13;

McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                108&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Good morning. Today is November 15th, 2001. Weâ&#128;&#153;re back for our third&#13;
&#13;
                session covering the evolution of technology in the World Bank with Mr. West&#13;
&#13;
                and Mr. Buck. We will begin by following up with our question in the last&#13;
&#13;
                session which dealt with the organizational changes and fine tunings throughout&#13;
&#13;
                the â&#128;&#153;90s, from the mid-â&#128;&#153;90s onward. In the context of the Bank becoming&#13;
&#13;
                increasingly more decentralized first administratively and geographically, we&#13;
&#13;
                covered in the first segment the global telecommunication network linkages.&#13;
&#13;
                Now, we would like you to talk about the role of the Bank as information&#13;
&#13;
                provider in the context of multiplicity of databases, data interfaces, etc., since its&#13;
&#13;
                products are highly information intensive and worldwide in character leading to&#13;
&#13;
                more exploitation of documents and data and certainly a demand for better tools&#13;
&#13;
                to do so. Would you like to take this?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, let me start. This is a period of time when parts of the Bank start to&#13;
&#13;
                recognize that there is an external audience as well as an internal audience.&#13;
&#13;
                Some of that awareness already existed with regard to databases such as the&#13;
&#13;
                external debt data which was a major publication of the Bank. I would say the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank was the sole source of providing external data information. But I think&#13;
&#13;
                during this period of time â&#128;&#147; and itâ&#128;&#153;s not so much within the information&#13;
&#13;
                technology part of the Bank, but within the Development Economics area of the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank â&#128;&#147; that we started to accumulate databases from other organizations. Some&#13;
&#13;
                of those existed previously, but were maintained by other organizations. They&#13;
&#13;
                were brought into the Bank on a more systematic and organized basis. Within&#13;
&#13;
                the Operations complex, people started to think about what was then called the&#13;
&#13;
                Africa Live Database, an accumulation of socio-economic data that would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  109&#13;
&amp;#12;                underpin the economic and sector work done within a Region. People were also&#13;
&#13;
                thinking about making this data easily accessible and widely available to the&#13;
&#13;
                relevant Bank staff, largely economists but also to sector specialists. There was&#13;
&#13;
                a growing recognition of both an internal audience and external sources of&#13;
&#13;
                information as well as the need to bring these together to allow easy access as&#13;
&#13;
                well as dissemination. There was also a growing recognition of the importance&#13;
&#13;
                of information in the way that we work and its importance of the economic and&#13;
&#13;
                sector work underpinning the lending of the Bank. This fitted into the Advisory&#13;
&#13;
                Services work the Bank does as well. . This recognition came mainly from&#13;
&#13;
                Development Economics, Operations and from other parts of the Bank. The&#13;
&#13;
                technology part of the Bank was the facilitator for this from an infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
                and a software standpoint. That information is becoming, I wonâ&#128;&#153;t say a line of&#13;
&#13;
                business, but at least something that can help get the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s message across.&#13;
&#13;
                But it was done in a stovepipe fashion. There were attempts to integrate this,&#13;
&#13;
                but then you get into the multiple databases, the interfaces, the issues of&#13;
&#13;
                maintaining current information and the like. I know I at least became more&#13;
&#13;
                aware of the exploitation of information, documents and publications from the&#13;
&#13;
                technology side of the Bank. Dee, maybe you can â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The subject of multiplicity of databases and data interfaces triggers in me something we&#13;
&#13;
                have not mentioned yet. This question is positioned at about 1994/95. We have talked&#13;
&#13;
                at some length about the decentralization of application development that went on in&#13;
&#13;
                1985. What happened in those intervening 10 years was the application development&#13;
&#13;
                community coalesced around some specific collections of information, which began to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             110&#13;
&amp;#12;                aggregate these collections of people into units and created very well defined&#13;
&#13;
                communities of interest, if you will. George referred to Development Economics,&#13;
&#13;
                which is maybe the one area that has been mostly the same throughout the whole&#13;
&#13;
                history going back to the â&#128;&#152;70s. But there are other areas and I just quickly made a little&#13;
&#13;
                list of them. This may turn out to be important later on when we start talking about the&#13;
&#13;
                formation of ISG. Historically, Finance was a huge user of information technology,&#13;
&#13;
                which tended to form into a group in Treasury. At different times they were&#13;
&#13;
                organizationally separate groups, as Treasury itself was. These groups tended to follow&#13;
&#13;
                evolutions in the organization of Treasury. Sometime toward the end of this period they&#13;
&#13;
                coalesced into one group in Treasury. In the Controllers organization, where again&#13;
&#13;
                George was, the IT organization on some occasions mapped the organizational structure&#13;
&#13;
                so that there were some groups in Loans and some in Accounting. By this time I think&#13;
&#13;
                there was a Loan Systems group and an Accounting Systems group. In Operations&#13;
&#13;
                there was a systems group attached to a variety of different central organizational units.&#13;
&#13;
                Wherever the policy base of Operations was, thatâ&#128;&#153;s where the systems group was.&#13;
&#13;
                There was a systems group in Development Economics, in HR; and in in PBD, now&#13;
&#13;
                CRM. There was also a group in GSD and then the central IT group in OBP, so there&#13;
&#13;
                were ten or eleven of these different groups. The important thing is that each one of&#13;
&#13;
                these groups built systems independently of the others. They built interfaces. They&#13;
&#13;
                were competing for the hearts and minds of the users. Our intention in the&#13;
&#13;
                decentralization of these application development groups had been to put them closer to&#13;
&#13;
                the business; they were very successful at that. But, by 1995, this created a severe&#13;
&#13;
                problem in that every one of these groups was trying to define its own data, build its&#13;
&#13;
                own interfaces, build its own systems, and even in some cases run its own hardware.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 111&#13;
&amp;#12;                These groups were totally independent, as if they were isolated fiefdoms. The&#13;
&#13;
                multiplicity of databases and data interfaces in 1995 was a severe problem. We referred&#13;
&#13;
                earlier in the discussion to the enormous impact of the collection of systems originally&#13;
&#13;
                called the Operations MIS and then later the MIS and later the Accounting Systems had&#13;
&#13;
                on the development of systems in general in the Bank. At the time those systems were&#13;
&#13;
                developed, there was no other Bank-wide system which had a mechanism for data entry&#13;
&#13;
                in the local unit. That is, there were mainframe systems with people in the backroom&#13;
&#13;
                that put cards in the machines and stuff. But in terms of having a computer device in&#13;
&#13;
                every division of the Bank that was actually putting transactions into a central&#13;
&#13;
                computer, the only system that did that was the OPSMIS, later MIS and later BAS. As&#13;
&#13;
                these new systems came into being in all these other units, there was no way the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                was going to invest in building a parallel infrastructure for doing this. What happened&#13;
&#13;
                was the Accounting Department owned the interface that presented itself to users on&#13;
&#13;
                this system and as a result had an enormous controlling power over what other kinds of&#13;
&#13;
                systems could be presented to end customers. Other organizations had ideas about how&#13;
&#13;
                to build things that would be beneficial to the Bank but had no effective way to deliver&#13;
&#13;
                those until later when we had something like an Enterprise Network. Or alternatively,&#13;
&#13;
                when we had All-In-One, some people resorted to using the All-In-One interface&#13;
&#13;
                because it was ubiquitous. But at the time this thing started, we didnâ&#128;&#153;t even have PCs&#13;
&#13;
                everywhere. There was no way for people to connect to actual customers for their&#13;
&#13;
                systems. This was one of the big reasons why the accounting systems were at the center&#13;
&#13;
                of a lot of this power struggle that was going on. Many of these other groups had ideas&#13;
&#13;
                about things they wanted to deliver to customers and functionality they wanted to&#13;
&#13;
                implement. For example the General Services Department had a strong desire to make&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   112&#13;
&amp;#12;                it easier for people to buy things, to have a procurement system to deliver to end&#13;
&#13;
                customers. But, GSD canâ&#128;&#153;t do it without the cooperation of the Accounting Department&#13;
&#13;
                because the Accounting Department owns the interface. As a result the Procurement&#13;
&#13;
                Division System had to write [code] according to the specifications laid down by the&#13;
&#13;
                Accounting Department. They had to follow the rules set by Accounting.&#13;
&#13;
                Another example is systems that were being built in Operations to do project&#13;
&#13;
                planning. Staff time planning: the same thing was true; they had no effective&#13;
&#13;
                vehicle for delivering this. In fact a large amount of time in Operations in the&#13;
&#13;
                early â&#128;&#153;90s was spent on trying to build their own mechanism for delivering&#13;
&#13;
                things through PCs and getting people to hook up a separate connection outside&#13;
&#13;
                of the existing connections to create a vehicle to deliver what they then called&#13;
&#13;
                the Task Managerâ&#128;&#153;s Workstation. Much of the lack of success was due to the&#13;
&#13;
                difficulty of trying to solve not only the very difficult systems problems of&#13;
&#13;
                building the required functionality but also at the same time having to deal with&#13;
&#13;
                this infrastructure level.&#13;
&#13;
                Because the Accounting Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s systems were so dominant, some of the&#13;
&#13;
                other systems ended up by trying to forge alliances and gather information out&#13;
&#13;
                of those systems. For example in PBD, where they had no data of their own and&#13;
&#13;
                had no mechanism to get to customers, they arranged to get this information&#13;
&#13;
                from the Accounting systems, which helped to create this spaghetti of all these&#13;
&#13;
                systems talking to each other. People in Operations had to get data out of the&#13;
&#13;
                Accounting systems. People in the Accounting systems had to get data out of&#13;
&#13;
                the task planning systems in Operations. Budget people had to get data from&#13;
&#13;
                Accounting. Accounting had to get data from Budget. Accounting had to get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               113&#13;
&amp;#12;                data from HR. HR had to get data from somebody else. And so by this time&#13;
&#13;
                when we did a count a year or two later we had â&#128;&#147; I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember the exact&#13;
&#13;
                number â&#128;&#147; 65 systems and over 100 databases that were exchanging information&#13;
&#13;
                by 10, 15, 20 different mechanisms overnight. There was FTP, file transfers, the&#13;
&#13;
                Message Handling System by Finance as well as the transfer tapes from place to&#13;
&#13;
                place. We had every kind of machinery on earth trying to move all of this data&#13;
&#13;
                around between all these systems overnight so that individual groups could&#13;
&#13;
                continue to maintain their own individual systems and data. Furthermore, since&#13;
&#13;
                they had been built independently, every one of these systems had their own&#13;
&#13;
                conceptual definition of the data elements. An item-like project, which is a very&#13;
&#13;
                important concept in the Bank had â&#128;&#147; this is not an exaggeration â&#128;&#147; had 17&#13;
&#13;
                different definitions in 17 different databases.      For some people, for some&#13;
&#13;
                purposes, a project was a thing which might be in various stages from just&#13;
&#13;
                conceptual all the way through to completion. For other people a project was&#13;
&#13;
                only a thing, which had a project number or a loan number. But it was true that&#13;
&#13;
                there were 17 definitions of this one data element.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Another example of this are country codes. You had country codes from the&#13;
&#13;
                beginning of when the Bank started in business. Country codes were imbedded&#13;
&#13;
                in project identification codes and imbedded in loan numbers. The first loan&#13;
&#13;
                numbers of the Bank were a numeric sequence and then the country code and&#13;
&#13;
                the alpha country code lost its meaning. But as time went on, country names&#13;
&#13;
                changed. In addition to country codes there were also currency codes. So there&#13;
&#13;
                were multiple versions of country codes. And there are sector codes; in fact&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s an exercise going on right now in the Bank to revise the sector codes and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             114&#13;
&amp;#12;                then sub-sector codes. People now even think that some of the sector codes are&#13;
&#13;
                not even sectors by the common definition of a sector. That creates a very large&#13;
&#13;
                problem from an information-processing standpoint. The result is you have to&#13;
&#13;
                rewrite the history to make it consistent for current analysis. The same thing&#13;
&#13;
                occurs with organizational codes, our own codes for the organizational units.&#13;
&#13;
                Now this is an organization that is constantly changing One of the things that I&#13;
&#13;
                helped to initiate when I was in the Planning and Budgeting Department was the&#13;
&#13;
                Unique Organizational Identifier, which is now in use. If an organizational&#13;
&#13;
                element didnâ&#128;&#153;t change but just moved location the coding of it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t change.&#13;
&#13;
                The same concept now applies to the UPI, which is the Universal Personal&#13;
&#13;
                Identification number. Prior to that you had a staff I.D. and a retirement I.D.&#13;
&#13;
                You also had a Social Security number. You had all of these data elements with&#13;
&#13;
                the proliferation of codes and keeping track of this created what Dee described&#13;
&#13;
                and an internal industry of people whose job was keeping the same information&#13;
&#13;
                in sync.   All of these file transfers and updates were required for consistency.&#13;
&#13;
                Even with all this effort we still had problems of consistency.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The complexity of this systems environment and the need to understand the&#13;
&#13;
                semantic content of these different databases were so difficult that it created a&#13;
&#13;
                whole industry of people who knew how to get into these systems and knew&#13;
&#13;
                what the semantic differences were between the databases and were therefore&#13;
&#13;
                able to reconcile the data. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t ask the same question to a system in&#13;
&#13;
                Operations and a system in Budget and a system in Accounting and expect to get&#13;
&#13;
                the same answer because the definition of the data elements was different. You&#13;
&#13;
                had to understand what was in and what was out of each number. There was a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             115&#13;
&amp;#12;                whole industry of people able to do this to some level of detail. There were two&#13;
&#13;
                or three masters that were widely recognized as the sort of the kings of this . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The data gurus.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, the data gurus. Mackie [Charlie McCaskill] and Connie Denario. These&#13;
&#13;
                were people (one of whom retired recently) that were acknowledged to truly&#13;
&#13;
                understand not only what the current state was but also what the prior history&#13;
&#13;
                was and the evolution of the data. When you did analytical work, you actually&#13;
&#13;
                had to involve those people.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     And where were these people located?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Throughout the organizations. Some of them were within the Planning and&#13;
&#13;
                Budgeting area.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Actually they moved around at different times during the wars of who had&#13;
&#13;
                control of what.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       One of the things thatâ&#128;&#153;s not recognized is that the whole economics of&#13;
&#13;
                reconciliation is a high cost for an organization to pay to ensure that the data that&#13;
&#13;
                it deals with is consistent. The reconciliation activity is a price the Bank paid&#13;
&#13;
                for the evolution. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not saying that could have been done differently. But in&#13;
&#13;
                retrospect we paid a very high price for a multiplicity of databases and trying to&#13;
&#13;
                keep these things in synchronization.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Now we move on, again to the Bank as a knowledge-based and knowledge-&#13;
&#13;
                producing institution, producing information in a multitude of forms. How&#13;
&#13;
                successful was the Information Management Architecture (IMA) framework&#13;
&#13;
                model in seeking to provide a coherent plan throughout the Bank? Mr. Buck.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  116&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       I have to answer this on multiple levels. First, in a way Iâ&#128;&#153;m interpreting the last&#13;
&#13;
                question and this question as being similar questions about two different&#13;
&#13;
                categories of information. The previous question was about structured&#13;
&#13;
                information and this question is largely about unstructured information. I would&#13;
&#13;
                say that the Bank was ahead on the intellectual analysis of the degree to which it&#13;
&#13;
                was important for the Bank to solve the unstructured data issues, to recognize&#13;
&#13;
                the relationship between the structured and unstructured data, and to recognize&#13;
&#13;
                that they needed to be treated in a single framework. And I give a lot of credit,&#13;
&#13;
                well initially, to Flavia Fonseca for her intellectual leadership in this area. In the&#13;
&#13;
                case of this particular document, the IMA, of course you also have to pay&#13;
&#13;
                homage to Clem Steyer, who had a lot to do with this. The thinking that went&#13;
&#13;
                into this document by that set of people and some others such as Ramesh Siva&#13;
&#13;
                and Patty Hamsher was fabulous. Now, if you ask me what impact did it&#13;
&#13;
                ultimately have?      It laid a foundation which enabled ITS and ISG to&#13;
&#13;
                communicate internally and to try to set strategies and form tactics for&#13;
&#13;
                approaching the problem. It did not make it possible for us to solve the problem&#13;
&#13;
                nor could we claim success from the time this was written. Although the IMA&#13;
&#13;
                produced a lot of learning and products, some parts of which are still in use, the&#13;
&#13;
                effort to attack the problem by the top-down approach laid out in the IMA did&#13;
&#13;
                not succeed. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very interesting and I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether either of the parties&#13;
&#13;
                involved would agree with this analysis of the situation but Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to&#13;
&#13;
                hypothesize that from the early â&#128;&#153;90s Flavia Fonseca began to approach the&#13;
&#13;
                problem of helping the Bank manage unstructured information in a bottom-up&#13;
&#13;
                grassroots way. The approach was rooted in the way divisions worked by trying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  117&#13;
&amp;#12;                to understand their problems and trying to formulate a strategy for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                The way the divisions managed project files, the problems they had with black&#13;
&#13;
                books [loose-leaf notebooks used to file documents].       The File Improvement&#13;
&#13;
                Program or actually even before that with RAMIP (Records and Archives&#13;
&#13;
                Management Improvement Program) marked the beginnings of trying to&#13;
&#13;
                conduct what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always characterized as guerrilla warfare.        Flavia was a&#13;
&#13;
                master of doing that. And from that time, the early â&#128;&#153;90s until the day she retired,&#13;
&#13;
                Flavia had a vision. and knew where she was going. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t matter how many&#13;
&#13;
                times we changed the people that were her boss or what those people thought; in&#13;
&#13;
                a way, she managed to persuade them. That was one side of the coin. Then&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s the other side of the coin. In about 1993 or thereabouts, Clem Steyer,&#13;
&#13;
                whom I regard as one of the best systems developers and one of the best analysts&#13;
&#13;
                of information we ever had, returned from Finance, where he had been. Hywel&#13;
&#13;
                Davies put Clem in charge of trying to build a system. Clem and Flavia and&#13;
&#13;
                other people worked together on the IMA. Clem tried to approach this problem&#13;
&#13;
                from the top down instead of Flaviaâ&#128;&#153;s way of doing it from the bottom up. This&#13;
&#13;
                is one of Flaviaâ&#128;&#153;s many periods. During this particular period Clem wanted to&#13;
&#13;
                apply the same techniques to solving this problem that he had successfully&#13;
&#13;
                applied his whole life to solving other problems. He analyzed the problem,&#13;
&#13;
                broke it down, and did functional decomposition.         Clem set a strategy for&#13;
&#13;
                solving it, which was sound. But this problem is hard. To solve it the way Clem&#13;
&#13;
                wanted to solve it would have required the organization to have more will than it&#13;
&#13;
                had. Clemâ&#128;&#153;s obstacle always â&#128;&#147; Clem came out of the Air Force â&#128;&#147; was that he&#13;
&#13;
                was accustomed to being able to find somebody that had enough stars on their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               118&#13;
&amp;#12;                shoulder that could make a decision and was willing to make a decision to&#13;
&#13;
                allocate resources. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the way the Bank works. The Bank doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                even know how it allocates resources in the general sense! So, for a period of&#13;
&#13;
                years, Clem tried to solve this intractable problem.&#13;
&#13;
                Also, Clemâ&#128;&#153;s approach to this problem was perhaps inconsistent with the culture&#13;
&#13;
                of the organization. There were a lot of stakeholders. As long as we were in&#13;
&#13;
                sort of a chargeback environment and itâ&#128;&#153;s their money weâ&#128;&#153;re dealing with, you&#13;
&#13;
                need to spend a lot of time stroking these stakeholders and being sure that their&#13;
&#13;
                opinions are sought and being sure that they feel involved. This was not Clemâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                way of working. He wanted somebody to give him a problem. He had the&#13;
&#13;
                intellect; the resources, and the smart people. Clem could solve this problem; he&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t need to go talk to all those people. But he did need to go talk to all those&#13;
&#13;
                people because they were shooting at him from across the road. Everybody was&#13;
&#13;
                shooting at Clem because he hadnâ&#128;&#153;t paid attention to stroking the stakeholder&#13;
&#13;
                community. When the crunch came on the money, nobody was on his side.&#13;
&#13;
                Ultimately, the project to approach this from the top down was never completed.&#13;
&#13;
                It was put on hold. Whether it would have worked or not, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know. I think&#13;
&#13;
                if I had to pick somebody in the world to build it, Iâ&#128;&#153;d pick Clem Steyer, OK.&#13;
&#13;
                But his approach rooted in his experience was probably not appropriate for the&#13;
&#13;
                kind of political situation he faced.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was internally developed software [known as the Electronic Document&#13;
&#13;
                Management System (EDMS)]. There was no commercial package available&#13;
&#13;
                that incorporated all of the elements to deal with the bringing together of this.&#13;
&#13;
                This was also a centralized approach. This is where the â&#128;&#156;starsâ&#128;? came in that Dee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               119&#13;
&amp;#12;                talked about in that you had to have the organization willing to go along with a&#13;
&#13;
                way of doing business. The organization of the Bank has always been, well, I&#13;
&#13;
                need this column over here or I need this additional piece of information. That&#13;
&#13;
                was where Clem ran into problems. Some of the design work done by the&#13;
&#13;
                central system â&#128;&#147; and this not a simple problem â&#128;&#147;was well beyond what was&#13;
&#13;
                available commercially. They solved some very difficult problems. Ultimately&#13;
&#13;
                they may have won some of the battles, the tactical battles. But organizationally&#13;
&#13;
                this was not a package that had a major impact on the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       A lot of the work that got done [in the EDMS] was reused in IRIS. Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting that&#13;
&#13;
                IRIS continued to evolve all during this time. IRIS started as a way to help manage&#13;
&#13;
                divisional files electronically after the File Improvement Program began to put in place&#13;
&#13;
                the ability for divisions just to scan paperwork, final form documents, including paper&#13;
&#13;
                coming from outside the Bank, capture it, and manage it at a divisional level. Now&#13;
&#13;
                hereâ&#128;&#153;s where I have so much regard for Flaviaâ&#128;&#153;s brilliance. The records program in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank, which we manage, has been under fire from a budget point of view for as long as&#13;
&#13;
                Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been here. Itâ&#128;&#153;s always something that somebodyâ&#128;&#153;s willing to sacrifice because itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                nobodyâ&#128;&#153;s sacred cow but ours. Everybody needs it. The institution needs it. And yet,&#13;
&#13;
                when push comes to shove, it keeps getting cut. When Flavia began to try to solve&#13;
&#13;
                some of these problems, she recognized that there would never be enough money to do&#13;
&#13;
                this program right. There would never be enough money to run all those record centers&#13;
&#13;
                and catch up, let alone get ahead. Flaviaâ&#128;&#153;s brilliance was in her recognition that in the&#13;
&#13;
                absence of any kind of electronic document management system, every division in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank had people filing information in black books. They had to solve this problem at&#13;
&#13;
                the local divisional level anyway. No matter what we did. They had no tools [to file&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                120&#13;
&amp;#12;                electronically], but they had all this paper coming in from borrowers and paper&#13;
&#13;
                generated locally to manage. In addition, they had to manage this continuity of task&#13;
&#13;
                managers and division chiefs coming and going. All of this was managed manually.&#13;
&#13;
                They werenâ&#128;&#153;t doing a very good job. My observation is that Flavia recognized that if&#13;
&#13;
                we could give them a tool to help them manage the documents, we could shift the whole&#13;
&#13;
                records burden onto them. That is, if we could get them to use the tool [IRIS] provided&#13;
&#13;
                by us for document management and profiling â&#128;&#147; not as something they were doing for&#13;
&#13;
                the records program but as something they were doing in order to manage the local&#13;
&#13;
                paper â&#128;&#147; then we could capture the records for free [and also close the local records&#13;
&#13;
                centers]! We shifted the whole burden right onto the local units, which was a stroke of&#13;
&#13;
                genius. Otherwise we were dead in the water in terms of ever being able to get caught&#13;
&#13;
                up in a records program.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Was there any resistance to this?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes. One of the elements of resistance was that we felt it was important for the&#13;
&#13;
                operational divisions to identify a specific individual who would then get a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                training in how to use this tool we they were going to get. Part of what we&#13;
&#13;
                wanted to do was to be sure they did a good job of profiling the documents so&#13;
&#13;
                they could find them the next week or later. We wanted them to send somebody&#13;
&#13;
                to school for initially 30 days to learn how to do this and then that personâ&#128;&#153;s full-&#13;
&#13;
                time job was going to be to manage this. The resistance we got even up to today&#13;
&#13;
                has been that it requires the divisions to reshuffle the work in their own area.&#13;
&#13;
                They tended to spread support staff around and allocated the responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
                over time to however they did it. This requirement from us made them have to&#13;
&#13;
                shuffle the work, which was a bit of a problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                121&#13;
&amp;#12;                Second, as this thing evolved, operational divisions differed in the degree of&#13;
&#13;
                their understanding and appreciation of how important this may or may not be to&#13;
&#13;
                them in terms of doing their work. Those units who felt that it was essential for&#13;
&#13;
                them to have management of the local paper embraced this warmly. Others&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t.   Halfway through this program, we really needed this to become a&#13;
&#13;
                corporate program. We really need for everybody to buy this. And furthermore,&#13;
&#13;
                they would have to pay for it. Flavia, being the master of guerrilla warfare as&#13;
&#13;
                she was, started this all off on a shoestring. Whenever she took a loss, she sold&#13;
&#13;
                it in any way she could to get it started. Frankly she would never have gotten it&#13;
&#13;
                off the ground if she didnâ&#128;&#153;t do that.      We had no effective way to apply&#13;
&#13;
                chargeback principles to information. Information in the Bank has always been&#13;
&#13;
                free. This problem went back to the beginning of the â&#128;&#153;90s. The only vehicle we&#13;
&#13;
                had for mobilizing resources to do any of this work was chargeback, which was&#13;
&#13;
                not really very appropriate for this kind of stuff particularly when people are&#13;
&#13;
                accustomed to getting it for free. They never paid for the Record Centers or for&#13;
&#13;
                the local Information Centers. So why all of a sudden do they have to pay for&#13;
&#13;
                IRIS? Weâ&#128;&#153;re saying, â&#128;&#156;this is better, itâ&#128;&#153;ll help you manage the problems that you&#13;
&#13;
                have anyway; on the other hand you are going to have to pay us.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This is an endemic problem that the organization has faced. This was being sold&#13;
&#13;
                on what I will call the retail basis. This was on a unit-by-unit basis. So you had&#13;
&#13;
                a division chief who felt that this was worthwhile. That they were willing to pay&#13;
&#13;
                for some hardware which was I believe $20 thousand . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Per division.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, per division.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              122&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Plus the training?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Plus the training. But in one sense, the training was of an individual that was&#13;
&#13;
                already on their payroll. So the aspect of an incremental charge â&#128;&#147; they had to&#13;
&#13;
                agree to modify the work that the individual was doing â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       And they had to have the will, too, to do it that way as opposed to just hiring&#13;
&#13;
                somebody and then â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, this was a long-term investment. Trying to convince on a unit-by-unit&#13;
&#13;
                basis that this system actually has benefit â&#128;&#147; as opposed to the SAP approach&#13;
&#13;
                which said, â&#128;&#156;this is a corporate decision, that this is the way the institution is&#13;
&#13;
                going to function.â&#128;? â&#128;&#147; has been a problem that the organization has had since the&#13;
&#13;
                beginning with regard to the use of technology. The corporate approach â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
&#13;
                stars on the shoulderâ&#128;? approach: this is the ability to say that organizationally&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;ve looked at it and this is what makes sense for the organization, as opposed&#13;
&#13;
                to either an idea originating within the Information Technology side of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                or within the business side of the Bank. And trying to bring it from the ground&#13;
&#13;
                up.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      I have two questions in light of what you have both said.           First, records&#13;
&#13;
                management was such that there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t enough corporate recognition of the&#13;
&#13;
                importance of managing and keeping records as such?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Absolutely true, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think that intellectually they may have understood this. But understanding it&#13;
&#13;
                intellectually and then providing a budgetary provision for it as well as positions&#13;
&#13;
                which was how you actually funded programs up until â&#128;&#153;92. These were two&#13;
&#13;
                different things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               123&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       The senior managers were confronted continually with more good ideas than&#13;
&#13;
                they had money. Bear in mind that during the course of this period of time&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re also confronting in the Bank a massive change in the world at large,&#13;
&#13;
                including the collapse of the Soviet Union. So here we are trying to grapple&#13;
&#13;
                with these massive problems in the world. We were also under a lot of pressure&#13;
&#13;
                from our stakeholders about the amount of money the Bank was spending and&#13;
&#13;
                pressure on the budget. Senior managers were confronted with people saying,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Well we need more money in order to manage the paper in the backroom.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                Well, there just wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really a lot of patience for that. Itâ&#128;&#153;s understandable; we&#13;
&#13;
                always have budget pressures.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And probably always will. So the choices were between trying to develop a&#13;
&#13;
                lending program for new members as opposed to implementing a records&#13;
&#13;
                management system or a system that makes it much easier for people to access&#13;
&#13;
                the information in process and historical documents of the organization. The&#13;
&#13;
                decision: you work on the most immediate problem.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Has that changed somewhat today?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think so. Iâ&#128;&#153;d say in the aftermath of the reorganization it took quite some time&#13;
&#13;
                for the Bank to recognize that the records had really gotten into a lot of trouble.&#13;
&#13;
                Actually when the Wapenhans Report came out, which I think was in â&#128;&#153;92, the&#13;
&#13;
                problem â&#128;&#147; the fact that the management of our own information was really not in&#13;
&#13;
                very good shape â&#128;&#147; was brought into sharper relief. Year after year more things&#13;
&#13;
                would happen to raise the temperature on this issue. Somewhere between â&#128;&#153;95&#13;
&#13;
                and now, somewhere in that range, the temperature on this particular issue began&#13;
&#13;
                to heat up significantly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               124&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      How is IRIS handling records from the day the Bank opened for business until&#13;
&#13;
                the â&#128;&#152;90s when it started being really active in records management?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think we need to separate IRIS from the so-called Image Bank. Now letâ&#128;&#153;s first&#13;
&#13;
                get all the caveats out here about the underlying technologies. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not the&#13;
&#13;
                expert on this stuff; there are people who know a hundred times more than I do.&#13;
&#13;
                My understanding of this is that the underlying technologies behind IRIS and the&#13;
&#13;
                ImageBank are the same. There is a big documents store. It used to be in one&#13;
&#13;
                form. Itâ&#128;&#153;s now in another form. The difference is that the IRIS system focuses&#13;
&#13;
                on providing a local scanner in the local division so that people can put stuff into&#13;
&#13;
                cabinets â&#128;&#147; documents stores . . .&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      The non-electronic . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No, theyâ&#128;&#153;re electronic. Document stores that are, can I say, owned locally and&#13;
&#13;
                managed locally in some way. Whereas the ImageBank was a program that took&#13;
&#13;
                place in the Internal Documents Unit where they systematically scanned selected&#13;
&#13;
                Bank reports. These were officially published Bank reports from different series&#13;
&#13;
                going back not all the way back to 1948 but to some time in the â&#128;&#153;70s. These&#13;
&#13;
                scanned reports were placed in a central store available internally as ImageBank&#13;
&#13;
                or externally on CD as World Development Sources.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       My simple conception of this is that the ImageBank dealt with the final form&#13;
&#13;
                current and historical documents and documents that were published. Most of&#13;
&#13;
                them were available internally by ImageBank. Although this may be a slight&#13;
&#13;
                misconception, I consider IRIS to be for work in process.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       IRIS is also final form documents. Only final form documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                125&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       But it includes emails. My distinction on work in process is there is a project&#13;
&#13;
                that is ongoing, OK? And that project is work in process.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       OK, that part is true.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       In building the project file for that project you produce documents. IRIS takes&#13;
&#13;
                those documents into a common data store that is accessible to multiple people.&#13;
&#13;
                IRIS is able to get documents in both from a scanning standpoint which are&#13;
&#13;
                largely documents not in electronic format and from external sources,&#13;
&#13;
                borrowers, whoever as well as documents produced internally, including Notes&#13;
&#13;
                email with attachments. So that in one sense itâ&#128;&#153;s not in process. But you use the&#13;
&#13;
                project as an organizing element for collection [for work that is in process].&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think youâ&#128;&#153;re right. IRIS was intended initially for project files. Initially it&#13;
&#13;
                dealt solely with documents that were scanned. In IRIS3 we added the ability to&#13;
&#13;
                move email traffic directly into IRIS without having to first print it out and then&#13;
&#13;
                scan it, which was an objection that people originally had. We do not yet have a&#13;
&#13;
                mechanism to take a document that we are creating in Word and move the&#13;
&#13;
                electronic form of it into IRIS. One of the other major elements of a document&#13;
&#13;
                management program is the ability to manage documents that are in preparation,&#13;
&#13;
                such as Word documents. You create a draft; you want to circulate it for&#13;
&#13;
                comments. You want to then make changes to it. You want to manage the&#13;
&#13;
                versions. You want to keep track of who has it and check it out for changes and&#13;
&#13;
                stuff. We donâ&#128;&#153;t do any of that at the moment. This is a very difficult problem&#13;
&#13;
                for which commercial products are evolving. A conscious decision was made&#13;
&#13;
                with IRIS that we would focus entirely on final form documents, that is to say&#13;
&#13;
                documents that donâ&#128;&#153;t change. Documents put in electronically â&#128;&#147; which are other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 126&#13;
&amp;#12;                than scanned â&#128;&#147; are documents that come out of Notes. There is email and also&#13;
&#13;
                Activity Rooms which can place documents into IRIS. Conceptually, the so-&#13;
&#13;
                called InfoClient, which is a term that I guess we havenâ&#128;&#153;t introduced yet, is a&#13;
&#13;
                piece of software for profiling that [could] live on every workstation in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.    And the idea is that, for example, if you have a Notes database,&#13;
&#13;
                discussion database or an Activity Room, and you want to take documents that&#13;
&#13;
                are in your Activity Room and put them into IRIS, the InfoClient pops up and&#13;
&#13;
                asks you for information about the document so that it can store information&#13;
&#13;
                about the document into the Information Warehouse, which is a separate&#13;
&#13;
                database of metadata. The InfoClient also produces the metadata for IRIS. It&#13;
&#13;
                puts that metadata into the Information Warehouse and then puts the documents&#13;
&#13;
                into IRIS.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Moving onto governance of information technology.          By 1995, information&#13;
&#13;
                governance â&#128;&#147; or how IT and IM decisions were made and enforced on a Bank-&#13;
&#13;
                wide or corporate level â&#128;&#147; was recognized as a critical issue in the Bank. Please&#13;
&#13;
                discuss the steps taken to deal with this issue around â&#128;&#153;96, for instance the&#13;
&#13;
                creation of the Information Technology Services (ITS) information management&#13;
&#13;
                group, and then Mohamed Muhsinâ&#128;&#153;s appointment and the departmental review&#13;
&#13;
                and the review of information technology at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This issue was recognized probably even before â&#128;&#153;96. I can recall that Charlotte&#13;
&#13;
                Jones-Carroll and I headed up a group that dealt with the governance issue with&#13;
&#13;
                regard to information technology.        I know that ITS staff and CAOs were&#13;
&#13;
                involved in that activity.         A paper was produced.    The Internal Audit&#13;
&#13;
                Department had made recommendations to senior management.            Actually I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            127&#13;
&amp;#12;                believe Price Waterhouse conducted a study and made recommendations similar&#13;
&#13;
                to those contained in the document produced by the group that Charlotte and I&#13;
&#13;
                headed up. That was another activity. I believe in â&#128;&#153;96 there was also a study&#13;
&#13;
                which was on the fringes of governance. When you weigh the Ernst &amp; Young&#13;
&#13;
                study which . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No, not yet. No but you are thinking about probably Coopers Lybrand, when we&#13;
&#13;
                had Lynne Knapp.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Lynne Knapp, who was I guess, a VP at Coopers Lybrand, came to address this&#13;
&#13;
                issue of information governance In addition, we had various consultants come&#13;
&#13;
                to advise us. I remember Peter Keene talking to the various people who were&#13;
&#13;
                stakeholders in this area. The recognition of the need for central direction was&#13;
&#13;
                clear but the organization had not acted on it. All of this was preliminary&#13;
&#13;
                ground; everyone agreed on the problem. In fact, there was a Harvard case&#13;
&#13;
                study, which was the precursor to the appointment of the CIO. That study&#13;
&#13;
                documented the fragmentation and the consequences of the fragmentation within&#13;
&#13;
                the organization.      This case study was another part of the foundation for&#13;
&#13;
                establishing the need for a stronger governance structure. The Bank did not&#13;
&#13;
                have a CIO.         This was a common position outside of the Bank.       It was&#13;
&#13;
                recognized that a central authority was needed to be able to say this is what the&#13;
&#13;
                institution needs from an overall bank-wide standpoint. When Mr. Wolfensohn&#13;
&#13;
                first came, he talked about the need for better control. I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall exactly&#13;
&#13;
                what his words were but it was . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Something about spending a $100 million, hiding information from each other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             128&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Yes. So this had gotten to the top of the organization. Now, the actual creation&#13;
&#13;
                of the Information Technology Services Department, I believe that existed prior&#13;
&#13;
                to â&#128;&#153;96, didnâ&#128;&#153;t it? [NOTE: OPB was in existence from Jan â&#128;&#153;94-Feb â&#128;&#153;96] Maybe&#13;
&#13;
                you can come in here on that because I come into ITS in â&#128;&#153;96.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I would like to discuss the main points of the history of the development of the&#13;
&#13;
                development of governance. Back in the CAD days â&#128;&#147; I talked about this in our&#13;
&#13;
                first session â&#128;&#147; there was the Computer Priorities Committee and then later on&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s was the IMCC, the Information Management Coordination Committee.&#13;
&#13;
                When IRMD was formed, a committee was created called IRAC (Information&#13;
&#13;
                Resources Advisory Committee), which consisted of the so-called data&#13;
&#13;
                administrators appointed from the federated areas of the Bank in charge of the&#13;
&#13;
                data. IRAC lasted as long as IRMD lasted. When ITF was formed, shortly after&#13;
&#13;
                the formation of and coincident with the reorganization of the Bank, it was&#13;
&#13;
                suggested that two new committees be formed. One committee was called&#13;
&#13;
                ITAC, the Information Technology Advisory Committee, and the other one was&#13;
&#13;
                called the IMTPC, Information Management Technology Policy Committee.&#13;
&#13;
                The IMTPC was supposed to be a senior committee chaired by a Vice President&#13;
&#13;
                and composed of Directors and Vice Presidents.        And ITAC was a more&#13;
&#13;
                technical committee that was supported by a group of advisory groups.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The ITAC and advisory group side of this focused on more technical areas and&#13;
&#13;
                on chargeback. The IMTPC was supposed to focus on big policy matters. I&#13;
&#13;
                would say the IMTPC never really worked. Fundamentally, we could never get&#13;
&#13;
                senior people to come or if they came, they glazed over whenever we talked to&#13;
&#13;
                them. Instead, they would send their local representative who was the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            129&#13;
&amp;#12;                person that sat on ITAC, who was likely to be a technical person. In January&#13;
&#13;
                1994 we formed OBP, the Organization and Business Practices Department,&#13;
&#13;
                which was an attempt to coalesce the technology with the organization design.&#13;
&#13;
                There was an expectation that we were going to do business process&#13;
&#13;
                reengineering and whatnot. During that time ITAC continued to function. We,&#13;
&#13;
                actually I formed this, formed yet another committee called the IS Managers&#13;
&#13;
                Group, which had the objective of trying to â&#128;&#156;redesign IT in the Bankâ&#128;?. Members&#13;
&#13;
                were drawn from all of the senior players in every group around the Bank that&#13;
&#13;
                had an IT function, together with all the CIFs CAOs. During the days of OBP,&#13;
&#13;
                those were the two groups that met. ITAC met on chargeback subjects and on&#13;
&#13;
                the PC distribution issues, which was the institutional workstation program and&#13;
&#13;
                central fund for trying to keep the computers up to date. Governance was one of&#13;
&#13;
                seven groups we had planned to form to focus on specific areas of the way IT&#13;
&#13;
                ran in the Bank and to try to make recommendations on how to change those&#13;
&#13;
                areas of IT. At the same time, OBP was also focusing on trying to bring about&#13;
&#13;
                change in other parts of the Bank. It probably isnâ&#128;&#153;t really our task here to&#13;
&#13;
                analyze what did and didnâ&#128;&#153;t happen with OBP particularly in terms of its&#13;
&#13;
                attempts to do process change for other parts of the Bank. Obviously, there are&#13;
&#13;
                a lot of mixed opinions about whether or not that was effective. After the death&#13;
&#13;
                of Mr. Preston, Mr. Wolfensohn decided he wanted to change the Bank. This&#13;
&#13;
                appetite for change had been significantly stoked up by the work done during&#13;
&#13;
                the OBP time, despite the fact, an enormous amount of money was spent and&#13;
&#13;
                very little measurable success was seen.     One area where we made some&#13;
&#13;
                progress in was in trying to apply some of these principles to IT. One of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            130&#13;
&amp;#12;                areas was IT governance, led by George and Charlotte. Another was customer&#13;
&#13;
                support, led by Teresa Tidwell, to improve IT support. George led one that we&#13;
&#13;
                called it DT1 and another one we called DT2. These were design teams: Design&#13;
&#13;
                Team One and Design Team Two.            Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting that at the time Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Wolfensohn came on board a lot of the work underway in OBP ended up being,&#13;
&#13;
                how shall I say, overtaken by events. Mr. Wolfensohn had his own agenda for&#13;
&#13;
                change, which he wanted to control it himself. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t want this OBP gang&#13;
&#13;
                down there doing it. Mr. Husain was the Vice President who was in charge of&#13;
&#13;
                this area and â&#128;&#147; as Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure you have discovered â&#128;&#147; there were tensions that grew&#13;
&#13;
                up and Mr. Husain ultimately left. Mr. Wolfensohn is the first President who&#13;
&#13;
                really focused on applying IT to solving the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s problems. He was aware&#13;
&#13;
                that we had no CIO nor effective information technology. One of the comments&#13;
&#13;
                in the report by the external auditor was that the systems area was in some&#13;
&#13;
                disarray. He [Mr. Wolfensohn] asked Price Waterhouse to do a specific study&#13;
&#13;
                on the subject of whether we should have a CIO. At the same time, we were&#13;
&#13;
                doing the IRM governance work, which came back with the recommendation for&#13;
&#13;
                a CIO. Also at the same time the Internal Auditor issued a report that said the&#13;
&#13;
                systems area was in chaos and central, strong central governance was needed.&#13;
&#13;
                Peter Keene was brought in by Ian Scott and he said the same thing. Then all of&#13;
&#13;
                this was piped up to Shahid Husain, who asked us to hire Lynne Knapp, a board&#13;
&#13;
                member and senior partner at Coopers. Lynne Knapp did a study on the same&#13;
&#13;
                subject very quickly. She recommended you do need some senior executive in&#13;
&#13;
                IT, although she actually didnâ&#128;&#153;t think we should call it CIO. In the fall of â&#128;&#152;95&#13;
&#13;
                there was an agreement out of this preponderance of opinions that we really&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            131&#13;
&amp;#12;                needed to do something in this area. At the same time Mr. Wolfensohn reached&#13;
&#13;
                out to his friend Lou Gerstner and asked IBM (Lou Gerstner), to send some&#13;
&#13;
                people here, to look at whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on here, and to tell us, tell Mr. Wolfensohn&#13;
&#13;
                what we should do. The decision was made. In fact the President even said to&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank-at-large â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to hire a CIO.â&#128;? He set the task for Shahid, who&#13;
&#13;
                gave the task to Ian Scott and Richard Gregory, who hammered out a little job&#13;
&#13;
                description which was not very good in my opinion. They gave this to Egon&#13;
&#13;
                Zender, which is an international recruiting firm, and told them to find us a CIO.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Husain, reportedly told them, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to recruit a World Bank Vice&#13;
&#13;
                President here; donâ&#128;&#153;t bother bringing us any Americans.â&#128;? The politics of the&#13;
&#13;
                constituency of Vice Presidencies and the nationality is a sensitive issue with&#13;
&#13;
                the. Nevertheless, if you think about trying to recruit a CIO in 1995 and you&#13;
&#13;
                remove Americans, it cuts a pretty wide swath out of the available candidates.&#13;
&#13;
                We wanted a senior person with an understanding and knowledge of information&#13;
&#13;
                management, not just technology. We wanted somebody who was going to lead&#13;
&#13;
                us forward. It was difficult.. In the end, there were around 13, 14 candidates&#13;
&#13;
                that they brought in for interviews.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      But there was no thought of internally recruiting anyone?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       At the same time there were some internal candidates who were either persuaded&#13;
&#13;
                to put their hat in the ring or who chose to put their hat in the ring and others&#13;
&#13;
                whose hat was put into the ring even though they didnâ&#128;&#153;t want their hat in the&#13;
&#13;
                ring. There were I think four internal candidates and very capable people.. But&#13;
&#13;
                these people interested in having the job had either a history in the Bank or an&#13;
&#13;
                association with various parts of the IT history, which created the perception&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              132&#13;
&amp;#12;                that they might be weighed down with their own history. It would be hard&#13;
&#13;
                enough for somebody to come in and try to straighten this out.         If it was&#13;
&#13;
                somebody already part of all of the politics, it might be a disadvantage. By the&#13;
&#13;
                end of that year, and maybe by the spring or January, it was clear we had spent a&#13;
&#13;
                number of months trying to recruit the CIO. The President was on record to the&#13;
&#13;
                whole Bank saying we were going to have one. What follows now is my own&#13;
&#13;
                interpretation of events. Mr. Sven Sandstrom, who was the boss of all of these&#13;
&#13;
                people, was in a jam because we had now spent four or five months looking for&#13;
&#13;
                a CIO. The fact was that we had short listed the candidates to a handful who&#13;
&#13;
                might be able to do the job, but none of whom were really World Bank Vice&#13;
&#13;
                President material. The alternative that they found was to say, â&#128;&#156;Look here,&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;ve got his guy [Mohamed Muhsin] who we recruited from Africa who is the&#13;
&#13;
                deputy director of OBP who has made a fabulous success out of the task we set&#13;
&#13;
                for him, who has respect from everyone in the whole place, who delivers on&#13;
&#13;
                everything that he promises ...â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Who is not American.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Who is not American. â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦ who is very low key. And who has run this whole&#13;
&#13;
                thing with IBM.â&#128;? And the IBM people are, of course, feeding back, too. This&#13;
&#13;
                guy is really good. So they decided that â&#128;&#147; now Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking out of school here;&#13;
&#13;
                this is not a matter of record â&#128;&#147; they decided that they were going to make&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed Muhsin CIO.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      They, meaning?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Sven, and perhaps Jim. The difficulty was that we had this committee searching&#13;
&#13;
                for the CIO. The committee had agreed on several things. First of all, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             133&#13;
&amp;#12;                wanted a guy who was strong in information technology and information&#13;
&#13;
                management. Here we have Mohamed Muhsin, who is not a candidate, who is&#13;
&#13;
                the chair of the committee for selection of the CIO, and who has no experience&#13;
&#13;
                in IT.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Heâ&#128;&#153;s a chartered accountant.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       How to appoint Mohamed Muhsin to the job when heâ&#128;&#153;s the chair of the&#13;
&#13;
                committee and he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have the skills that we said we were looking for nor is&#13;
&#13;
                he on the list! [Laughs] They decided instead to say, â&#128;&#156;OK, look, technology&#13;
&#13;
                permeates everything we do. Our problems are serious problems of coordination&#13;
&#13;
                and communication among all these units. Finding one person who will come&#13;
&#13;
                here as a silver bullet isnâ&#128;&#153;t really the way this is going to work. Everybody has&#13;
&#13;
                to coordinate and cooperate. So we will not have a CIO. â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re going make&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed Muhsin the director of ITS, of the Department. â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to&#13;
&#13;
                break up OBP.â&#128;? In fact OBP had ceased to exist. Out of it came two pieces and&#13;
&#13;
                a fraction. One piece was the organization design staff, which was called the&#13;
&#13;
                Institutional Change Group, ICG. The second piece was ITS, which became the&#13;
&#13;
                Information Technology Services Department. The third little fractional unit&#13;
&#13;
                was an office of a VP of Information, which was included in the MOC code list&#13;
&#13;
                included for a brief period of time. There were only three employees: Ian Scott,&#13;
&#13;
                who was going to retire in a couple of weeks; Guido Deboeck, who had been&#13;
&#13;
                declared redundant and was serving out his time; and me, waiting for the CIO.&#13;
&#13;
                When the decision was made that we werenâ&#128;&#153;t going to have a CIO, we decided&#13;
&#13;
                to give Mohamed Muhsin additional responsibilities for coordinating technology&#13;
&#13;
                across all of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             134&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      And his title will be?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Director.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Director of ITS, OK? In the spring of 1996, Mohamed became director. I came&#13;
&#13;
                over to work for Mohamed.          George came from Controllers to work for&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed. We became part of the front office along with a couple of other&#13;
&#13;
                people. Returning to the question [about governance] again, one of the first&#13;
&#13;
                things we did â&#128;&#147;the ITS Managers Group continued to exist right up to this time&#13;
&#13;
                and in fact even met a few times after that. We remade the governance structure&#13;
&#13;
                as soon as we formed ITS. We kept ITAC but changed its composition. Prior to&#13;
&#13;
                this, ITAC had evolved into being almost entirely dominated by the CAOs,&#13;
&#13;
                Chief Administrative Officers, of the Bank because they were interested in&#13;
&#13;
                finances, the way the money was spent, chargeback, rates, etc. The CAOs&#13;
&#13;
                became the ones who dominated ITAC, backed up by their technology staff. So&#13;
&#13;
                you would have a CAO come and sitting right behind him would be the&#13;
&#13;
                technology guy from that area. And if we had any discussion on anything that&#13;
&#13;
                had to do with money the CAOs would pipe up and we had any discussion on&#13;
&#13;
                anything else, the technology guys would pipe up. There was nobody in the&#13;
&#13;
                room who would speak about what the business requirements were. All we&#13;
&#13;
                could talk about was technology or money. And so we remade ITAC and we&#13;
&#13;
                were going to invite people from the business side to be part of ITAC. The&#13;
&#13;
                other thing we did was we formed a thing called the Information Management&#13;
&#13;
                Group, the IMG. This was the next attempt after the IMTPC to recruit a senior&#13;
&#13;
                level group to come in and advise Mohamed Muhsin in fulfillment of this&#13;
&#13;
                requirement that he was supposed to try to coordinate across the whole place on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                           135&#13;
&amp;#12;                the subject of IT in the absence of a CIO. And we formed the IMG and they met&#13;
&#13;
                only a handful of times over the next 18 months, but on some critical issues.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       On the Director level . . . Even though the IMG met a few times, my sense is&#13;
&#13;
                that this period began to bring things together. There was more consensus in&#13;
&#13;
                these groups, with more of a business orientation and less technical in its nature.&#13;
&#13;
                Because you had to have a consensus with regard to a single direction as&#13;
&#13;
                opposed to individual groups satisfying what they saw as their own&#13;
&#13;
                requirements. The appointment of Mohamed and the reconstituted governance&#13;
&#13;
                structure was our first step in saying centrally, â&#128;&#156;This is the directionâ&#128;? to the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank and make it stick. The mode of operation was collaboration, coordination,&#13;
&#13;
                information sharing. And laying down a case for why this direction was â&#128;&#156;the&#13;
&#13;
                directionâ&#128;?; it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t just someone saying, â&#128;&#156;Follow me because I have the right&#13;
&#13;
                way to do this.â&#128;? A fair amount of effort went into these few meetings to present&#13;
&#13;
                the case and present the direction and arrive at the consensus.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      OK, shall we break now and then we can continue with the Departmental&#13;
&#13;
                Review when Mohamed was appointed?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, I think that the course of the next year and a half after this is very&#13;
&#13;
                important.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Thank you so much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
End Side A&#13;
Side B&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Weâ&#128;&#153;re continuing on with Mohamed Muhsinâ&#128;&#153;s appointment in spring of â&#128;&#153;96 as&#13;
&#13;
                Director of ITS. And now we would like you to talk about the Departmental&#13;
&#13;
                Review, and the review of information technology at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                136&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       OK. Mohamed Muhsin had been asked to take a position that involved a greater&#13;
&#13;
                degree of coordination of the various parts of the Bank. The formation of IMG&#13;
&#13;
                was a manifestation of that. However, earlier today we talked about the systems&#13;
&#13;
                environment that existed and the fragmentation of the systems development&#13;
&#13;
                community and more important the abysmal state that the data was in within the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t possible to get one consistent view of any element of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                situation,   There were also legendary blowups that occurred at senior&#13;
&#13;
                management level when different senior managers would be presented with&#13;
&#13;
                different data when there would be a conversation with the President about some&#13;
&#13;
                weighty matter involving a borrower and the current state of play between the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank and the borrower. Mohamed Muhsin had probably been given marching&#13;
&#13;
                orders from his boss to see how to attack this very difficult problem. This&#13;
&#13;
                problem was difficult because it was principally not a technical problem; it was&#13;
&#13;
                a political problem. It was matter of control and the hegemony of these various&#13;
&#13;
                players and tensions were high and people, the managers involved were â&#128;¦there&#13;
&#13;
                was a lot of emotion.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me add one point as background. One of the ideas that was floated in this&#13;
&#13;
                period of time was outsourcing some of the IT functions. So in the background&#13;
&#13;
                you have the potential for what was considered not to be a core service of the&#13;
&#13;
                institution being contracted out to commercial organizations. Which just added&#13;
&#13;
                further to the tension that existed at that point in time.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very important point. Actually that goes all the way back before this&#13;
&#13;
                time into the OBP days because one of the things that Shahid Husain and Ian&#13;
&#13;
                Scott had done was to bring a whole host of people in here and talk about the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            137&#13;
&amp;#12;                subject of outsourcing to see whether this was a sensible thing for us to do&#13;
&#13;
                because many people were doing it in the world. Mohamed Muhsin decided that&#13;
&#13;
                the way to approach the subject of the systems dilemma was by commissioning&#13;
&#13;
                a study, which for various reasons came to be known as the Information&#13;
&#13;
                Architecture Study.     In the end, nobody who understands what information&#13;
&#13;
                architecture is would probably characterize what we ended up doing as a study&#13;
&#13;
                of information architecture. But we did call it that at the outset. We floated an&#13;
&#13;
                RFP; we recruited an outside firm. Ernst &amp; Young won this particular bid to&#13;
&#13;
                come in and study in effect our systems environment. The managers involved&#13;
&#13;
                with the development groups around the Bank by and large welcomed this&#13;
&#13;
                because each manager engaged in the most serious and heated interactions&#13;
&#13;
                firmly believed that he or she was right and other people were wrong. These&#13;
&#13;
                consultants were going to straighten everything out. Put that guy to death, you&#13;
&#13;
                know? [Laughs] .&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed Muhsin was of course at the center of this and did his customary&#13;
&#13;
                masterful job of trying to steer these consultants to address the important issues,&#13;
&#13;
                which were not so much the petty grievances between these organizational sub-&#13;
&#13;
                units, but the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s inability to get control of its data and to formulate systems&#13;
&#13;
                that were corporate. The set of recommendations that came from Ernst &amp;&#13;
&#13;
                Young at the end were that we needed to buy a commercial off-the-shelf ERP&#13;
&#13;
                package able to perform most of the sort of administrative side of the work that&#13;
&#13;
                we did at the Bank. We had already done an ERP implementation for the HR&#13;
&#13;
                function.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      ERP is?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               138&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Enterprise Resource Planning.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, this is SAP and Oracle Financials and PeopleSoft and those kinds of things.&#13;
&#13;
                Ernst &amp; Young also recommended that we needed to make other changes,&#13;
&#13;
                including once again the creation of a CIO, which would be done by coalescing&#13;
&#13;
                all of the systems units together in the center.. The way it was couched at the&#13;
&#13;
                time was that we would bring them together at least for the duration of the&#13;
&#13;
                creation of a new set of systems. But we left open the possibility that these new&#13;
&#13;
                systems might in time revert back to the business units in an environment&#13;
&#13;
                characterized by much stronger data administration, information administration&#13;
&#13;
                and central control over corporate systems but that they might be&#13;
&#13;
                organizationally decentralized. That was, I would say, somewhat left open&#13;
&#13;
                although we tended to emphasize this a lot in trying to deal with the political&#13;
&#13;
                backlash of a proposal for all practical purposes to centralize everything. This&#13;
&#13;
                took place from the summer of â&#128;&#153;96 up until November, December. During&#13;
&#13;
                December and January of â&#128;&#153;97, these proposals went to the IMG and&#13;
&#13;
                subsequently went to an assembled group of Vice Presidents. There was a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                difference of opinion among the various parts of the Bank about whether this&#13;
&#13;
                was the right thing to do. I believe Mohamed Muhsin had the direct backing of&#13;
&#13;
                the Managing Directors and the President and could have forced this issue at any&#13;
&#13;
                point from January onward. He could have forced it and gotten a position and&#13;
&#13;
                had it made come true. But he wanted to bring these other folks along. He put&#13;
&#13;
                an enormous amount of energy into trying to deal with the objections. He&#13;
&#13;
                listened carefully to what peopleâ&#128;&#153;s concerns were and tried to modify the&#13;
&#13;
                proposals so that we could in fact satisfy everyone as best we could and go and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             139&#13;
&amp;#12;                get everybody on board with the proposal that we attack the systems in a&#13;
&#13;
                centralized way.&#13;
&#13;
                Now, one of the things that happened at this particular point in time was the&#13;
&#13;
                President, the new President, had now been here for a year. The new President&#13;
&#13;
                had convinced himself that he needed to remake the Bank. This is the beginning&#13;
&#13;
                of the Strategic Compact.          Of course, your program will learn about the&#13;
&#13;
                Strategic Compact from far more knowledgeable people than me.                My&#13;
&#13;
                perception of this is that during the early part of 1997, there was a lot of talk&#13;
&#13;
                about the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s ideas for remaking the Bank and about how a proposal was&#13;
&#13;
                going to be formulated for the Strategic Compact.         In anticipation of the&#13;
&#13;
                development of that proposal the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office hired KPMG to do what was&#13;
&#13;
                called the â&#128;&#156;cost-effectiveness review.â&#128;? It was, in my view, a kind of quid pro&#13;
&#13;
                quo from the President. If heâ&#128;&#153;s going to ask the Board for $250 million or&#13;
&#13;
                whatever the number was going to be, he wanted to be absolutely certain that he&#13;
&#13;
                was on solid ground in terms of the internal cost-effectiveness of the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
                that he had done everything that he could to insure that we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t â&#128;&#147; that he&#13;
&#13;
                couldnâ&#128;&#153;t â&#128;&#147; be accused of asking for more money when we hadnâ&#128;&#153;t cleaned up our&#13;
&#13;
                own house. So he launched the cost-effectiveness review to look at, I think it&#13;
&#13;
                was five areas, one of which was IT.          Now the context here you have to&#13;
&#13;
                recognize is that coming out of ITS, which had been commissioned to take a&#13;
&#13;
                central coordinating and leadership role, had been a study which looked at IT.&#13;
&#13;
                ITS had just finished coming up with a set of recommendations and had&#13;
&#13;
                agonizingly gone through all of the discussion of that with the IMG and VPs.&#13;
&#13;
                When right on its heels comes the cost-effectiveness review aimed at looking at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             140&#13;
&amp;#12;                IT. Looking at exactly the same stuff, but now coming from the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                office. We couldnâ&#128;&#153;t exactly say, â&#128;&#156;Well, we just did that.â&#128;? We had to just buy&#13;
&#13;
                into it, subscribe to it, and so the cost effectiveness review â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to let&#13;
&#13;
                George of course talk about this because he was the central figure in this â&#128;&#147; but&#13;
&#13;
                my view of what happened here was that we had yet another set of consultants&#13;
&#13;
                in to review more or less that same stuff and who by the time this was all over&#13;
&#13;
                made more or less the same set of recommendations. They said, â&#128;&#156;there was just&#13;
&#13;
                a study by Ernst &amp; Young. What they [Ernst &amp; Young] said, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the stuff, do&#13;
&#13;
                that. Coalesce all these systems groups and you will save a lot of money.&#13;
&#13;
                Rebuild these systems and get rid of this spaghetti and these 100 databases and&#13;
&#13;
                65 systems and replace them all with one sort of central system and you will&#13;
&#13;
                save a lot of money. Create a central organization headed by a CIO and you will&#13;
&#13;
                save a lot of money, because youâ&#128;&#153;ll be able to reduce the headcount by a&#13;
&#13;
                substantial amount. Furthermore, there are proposals on the table for a variety&#13;
&#13;
                of other things that needed to be done.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me add on to that the cost-effectiveness review. This was a study to validate the&#13;
&#13;
                projected cost savings that the Bank could contribute to the Strategic Compact in its&#13;
&#13;
                request for additional funding. In the IT area, one of the things that was different from&#13;
&#13;
                the prior studies was the comparison of the Bank to outside organizations. So, now we&#13;
&#13;
                have some statements by KPMG that say that the Bank is really a fairly cost-effective&#13;
&#13;
                organization. In fact this was based on a comparison of their databases of external&#13;
&#13;
                organizations largely in the financial area. Even though they were not an exact match,&#13;
&#13;
                we were close from their standpoint. They endorsed us by saying that weâ&#128;&#153;re actually a&#13;
&#13;
                reasonably well-run organization. But the way we spend our money shows we have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               141&#13;
&amp;#12;                issues; weâ&#128;&#153;re spending much more in the maintenance area than other comparable&#13;
&#13;
                organizations. So if we do bring things together under an ERP implementation, one of&#13;
&#13;
                the endorsement s of the prior recommendations, weâ&#128;&#153;ll be able to shift our spending on&#13;
&#13;
                IT and actually save money. This was a revalidation activity of what had gone on&#13;
&#13;
                beforehand. But itâ&#128;&#153;s also one, which says that things arenâ&#128;&#153;t really all that bad from an&#13;
&#13;
                IT standpoint in the Bank. You guys are using the funds that have been provided fairly&#13;
&#13;
                effectively. Of course they did much more than just look at the IT part of it but I think&#13;
&#13;
                we got a reasonably good bill of health. One of the things that became somewhat&#13;
&#13;
                problematic later was their forecast of the savings that could be achieved by the&#13;
&#13;
                centralization of staff and some of the other things. But I think on the whole when we&#13;
&#13;
                got through the SAP implementation, ISG did deliver on its commitments for savings&#13;
&#13;
                close to what had been forecast even by the cost-effectiveness review. This element â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                that comparison to outside organizations â&#128;&#147; was new and it turns out to be a very positive&#13;
&#13;
                part of the study for ISG.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Throughout most of the discussion there were supposed to be ten hypotheses&#13;
&#13;
                that in the end will end up being eleven according to my count. Some of the&#13;
&#13;
                proposals included a creation of CIO, consolidation of all the systems groups&#13;
&#13;
                and rebuilding the systems according to along the lines recommended by Ernst&#13;
&#13;
                &amp; Young. Another recommendation addressed the IT infrastructure (for which&#13;
&#13;
                we had a proposal on the table) to heavily standardize the technology. We had&#13;
&#13;
                recommended how helpful this would be in controlling costs and KPMG&#13;
&#13;
                endorsed those recommendations as well.         The way the cost-effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
                review was supposed to play out was that the recommendations from the five&#13;
&#13;
                big groups were coalesced. Then they were supposed to pick a small number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               142&#13;
&amp;#12;                those that were really going to be hard to do in phase two of the cost-&#13;
&#13;
                effectiveness review. Recommendations made by the sub-teams, which were&#13;
&#13;
                not selected for this phase two focus, were still supposed to be done by the&#13;
&#13;
                individual groups. None of ours made it into the phase two recommendations&#13;
&#13;
                but we did go on and do a lot of these things. Perhaps even more important,&#13;
&#13;
                though, is our strong coupling with the work going on there enabled us to&#13;
&#13;
                influence the proposals for the Strategic Compact. The resources that were&#13;
&#13;
                anticipated to be needed for the ERP implementation, or the remaking of the&#13;
&#13;
                systems, became a part of the Strategic Compact. I cannot overemphasize that I&#13;
&#13;
                think this is the single most important factor in our being successful at doing&#13;
&#13;
                this. At the end of 1996 we were telling the Bank that we needed to spend â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                Ernst &amp; Young said we needed to spend â&#128;&#147; $55 million to remake the systems.&#13;
&#13;
                In the absence of the Strategic Compact, I just cannot imagine that we would&#13;
&#13;
                have been given the money that we needed. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t get the $55 million; we&#13;
&#13;
                got $39 million. But it is only because of the Strategic Compact occurring at&#13;
&#13;
                that point in time that we were able to get $39 million. There is no way on earth&#13;
&#13;
                in the absence of the Strategic Compact that anybody would have given us $55&#13;
&#13;
                million. So this was so fortuitous for us. We came with a proposal and we had a&#13;
&#13;
                President who is interested in applying technology to solving development&#13;
&#13;
                problems. It was not because of his interest in IT; but because of his interest in&#13;
&#13;
                development. He saw us as an information engine, an organization founded on&#13;
&#13;
                knowledge. He saw what other Presidents hadnâ&#128;&#153;t seen. He was willing to go to&#13;
&#13;
                bat at the Board to get the money to reshape the Bank in a number of different&#13;
&#13;
                ways.    One of which was a heightened focus on knowledge and on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              143&#13;
&amp;#12;                information â&#128;&#147; the treasure trove of information â&#128;&#147; we have about how&#13;
&#13;
                development was done. He was willing to include the remaking of the systems&#13;
&#13;
                as one of the main pillars of the Strategic Compact. Enormous credit goes to&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Wolfensohn. But in my mind even more credit goes to Mohamed Muhsin&#13;
&#13;
                for finding the path through all of this to find the resources to do this work.&#13;
&#13;
                Somebody in another organization asked, â&#128;&#156;How did we do it?â&#128;? and I would have&#13;
&#13;
                to say, â&#128;&#156;This was from heaven.â&#128;? I donâ&#128;&#153;t know what else to say. A juxtaposition&#13;
&#13;
                of the stars.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Thereâ&#128;&#153;s another element associated with Mr. Wolfensohn, I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s probably&#13;
&#13;
                worthwhile mentioning here.        Mr. Wolfensohn came from the corporate&#13;
&#13;
                environment. Mr. Wolfensohn had contacts with Lou Gerstner and other CEOs&#13;
&#13;
                of organizations that are producers and major users of technology, not just&#13;
&#13;
                manufacturers but major users of technology. He saw that these organizations&#13;
&#13;
                are using technology to transform their organizations. The question became,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;How can we use technology to do development work and use it to improve how&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank actually works?â&#128;? It was propitious that he was the President at the&#13;
&#13;
                time when technology is actually able to deliver on promises that have been&#13;
&#13;
                made for a long time but only where thereâ&#128;&#153;s been partial success and partial&#13;
&#13;
                delivery. Not only was he receptive but he was also a pusher of this, a major&#13;
&#13;
                advocate for the use of technology within the organization, which was in&#13;
&#13;
                combination with the groundwork that already laid. I can recall one of the&#13;
&#13;
                meetings that he held where he had a table full of books. He said, â&#128;&#156;You know&#13;
&#13;
                all of these books are Bank studies; I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got an original question, but I&#13;
&#13;
                find thereâ&#128;&#153;s already been a study on it.â&#128;? The Bank is extremely good at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             144&#13;
&amp;#12;                analysis part, but the action part, the ability to move something, make something&#13;
&#13;
                happen is where it was lacking. Not that what was done analytically was a&#13;
&#13;
                simple thing to accomplish, but the will or effort to actually take that next step is&#13;
&#13;
                a major element in getting us beyond just understanding the problem and&#13;
&#13;
                agreeing on the problem statement that is put into action as a solution.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I very strongly agree with what you just said. I just want to add one little&#13;
&#13;
                element which is that how fortunate for us that at that point in time, we have a&#13;
&#13;
                President who is something of a visionary and wants to see some action on this&#13;
&#13;
                and we have the guy who is in charge of ITS/ISG who happens to an&#13;
&#13;
                implementer. Unlike any of these other leaders weâ&#128;&#153;ve had, Mohamed Muhsin is&#13;
&#13;
                not a visionary. Heâ&#128;&#153;s not a guy whoâ&#128;&#153;s got a grounding in IT, who has some&#13;
&#13;
                vision of where he wants to go. Heâ&#128;&#153;s a guy who builds things, who implements&#13;
&#13;
                things.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And he gets it done.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Gets things done.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       He delivers.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       He delivers. His focus was entirely on it. He was perfectly content for the&#13;
&#13;
                President to set the vision. He was also remarkable in the extent to which heâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                willing to listen to these outside consultants, the KPMGs, the Ernst &amp; Youngs. I&#13;
&#13;
                have so little patience with these outside consulting firms. We hire them; they&#13;
&#13;
                come in. They run in here with twelve junior kids just out of high school and&#13;
&#13;
                look like theyâ&#128;&#153;re 12 years old, who come in, pick our pocket and tell us stuff&#13;
&#13;
                back to us that we tell them. Mohamed Muhsin will get them in the room and&#13;
&#13;
                listen raptly to what they say and heâ&#128;&#153;s so interested and heâ&#128;&#153;s so grateful to them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 145&#13;
&amp;#12;                and at the same time he manages to make them say what he wants them to say.&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s just so amazing to watch when he does that.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      To follow on with what we were just discussing, we have moved from&#13;
&#13;
                technology to information to building a knowledge bank. In June â&#128;&#153;95 Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Wolfensohn became the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s ninth President and almost immediately&#13;
&#13;
                introduced a number of reforms. The Board approved the Strategic Compact in&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#153;97 with greater emphasis on harnessing information for development and&#13;
&#13;
                building a knowledge bank. Please discuss the mission of the newly reorganized&#13;
&#13;
                ITS formulated in FY â&#128;&#153;97 and its role in supporting the Knowledge Bank vision&#13;
&#13;
                i.e., Systems Renewal, Enterprise Network extension, etc. Also, what spurred on&#13;
&#13;
                the formation of the Information Solutions Group going from ITS to ISG and&#13;
&#13;
                how did it fit in the with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s agenda on policy strategy and standards&#13;
&#13;
                affecting information technology?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well let me start for a little bit and Dee can jump in here. The formation of ISG&#13;
&#13;
                is mid-â&#128;&#153;97; I believe itâ&#128;&#153;s either July or August â&#128;&#153;97. And that is the point in time&#13;
&#13;
                where the CIO position is created. Mohamed Muhsin was appointed as the CIO.&#13;
&#13;
                It is also the point in which we bring together in ISG the applications&#13;
&#13;
                development units and some of the support staff in the major groups within the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank that had been located in and reported to the business units. Controllers,&#13;
&#13;
                GSD, HR â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       PBD.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       PBDâ&#128;¦ These come into â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               146&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Yes, OPSMIS â&#128;¦come into ISG. This brought together and implemented some&#13;
&#13;
                of the prior recommendations. We had for the first time a CIO appointed and&#13;
&#13;
                ISG created, a move from ITS to ISG.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Weâ&#128;&#153;re in the business plans for FY â&#128;&#153;97 which were actually developed in late&#13;
&#13;
                FY â&#128;&#153;96. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting is that as early as say December of â&#128;&#153;96, it was clear&#13;
&#13;
                to us that ISG was going to be formed. We were meeting with the IMG and&#13;
&#13;
                with the Vice Presidents to go over the recommendations first of the Ernst &amp;&#13;
&#13;
                Young report and then later discussions about the KPMG report. It was clear&#13;
&#13;
                that there was senior management support at the Managing Director level and&#13;
&#13;
                perhaps even the Office of the President for doing this. Mohamed Muhsin&#13;
&#13;
                continued to pay attention to obtain support for this idea, even from people who&#13;
&#13;
                on the surface were opposed to it or felt that they might not be. It was very&#13;
&#13;
                interesting that it was an entire six months before we, the Bank, actually acted&#13;
&#13;
                on this recommendation while all the time Mohamed Muhsin was consensus&#13;
&#13;
                building and coalition building by reaching out to the different parties involved&#13;
&#13;
                and trying to address their concerns. We ended up leaving out Development&#13;
&#13;
                Economics, the Economics Group, Shaida [Baidee] and Treasury for different&#13;
&#13;
                reasons in each case.&#13;
&#13;
                In the case of Treasury, they had very isolated systems not so connected to&#13;
&#13;
                everything else, which could not be said of the Controller systems, where the&#13;
&#13;
                management of the loans and the management of the accounting systems had&#13;
&#13;
                strong interactions with everything that was going on in mainline operations.&#13;
&#13;
                Thatâ&#128;&#153;s not true of Treasury. Nobody but Treasury is involved in these isolated&#13;
&#13;
                systems which manage the investments and the cash and try to mobilize capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             147&#13;
&amp;#12;                Second, it was extremely critical that their systems continue to function. We&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t have responsibility for those systems; they ran them themselves. If we&#13;
&#13;
                took over these systems at a time when we were trying to do all these other&#13;
&#13;
                things there was a risk that there would be a hiccup in these systems and there&#13;
&#13;
                was a lot of money involved. These systems were running OK, Furthermore,&#13;
&#13;
                the Managing Director of Finance at that time was Jessica Einhorn who had&#13;
&#13;
                come out of Treasury an area that she had a lot of affinity for. I think that this&#13;
&#13;
                may have also been somewhat political. Our recognition of the importance of&#13;
&#13;
                these financial systems of the Treasury, and the importance of keeping them&#13;
&#13;
                running I think helped to make her feel perhaps more comfortable in letting us&#13;
&#13;
                coalesce other parts of the Finance Complex. In the case of Economics I think&#13;
&#13;
                the situation is different. There the work that is done is so much more statistics&#13;
&#13;
                and analysis than it is actual systems development. There are people there who&#13;
&#13;
                are statisticians or data analysts who happen also to be programmers. In a way it&#13;
&#13;
                doesnâ&#128;&#153;t make a lot of sense to make those people part of the IT community.&#13;
&#13;
                Also, Shaida has her own constituency in that area and there just wasnâ&#128;&#153;t really&#13;
&#13;
                any percentage in trying to deal with trying to consolidate that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The numbers are also relatively small.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, itâ&#128;&#153;s not big money, itâ&#128;&#153;s I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, $8 million, and it is not a big&#13;
&#13;
                problem. Whereas this tension that existed between the people who were in&#13;
&#13;
                Operations, the people who were in Accounting and HR and GSD and PBD&#13;
&#13;
                around the same kind of information, that was where the big problem was. It&#13;
&#13;
                was very important, the time that Mohamed Muhsin spent, those six or seven&#13;
&#13;
                months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              148&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Yes, exactly. And there was a mission strategy formulated at that time for FY&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#153;97 whereby he talks about standardizing and standardization and so on and so&#13;
&#13;
                forth.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. West:       Yes, itâ&#128;&#153;s the five-step program which is the standardization of the environment,&#13;
&#13;
                the global network, expansion of the global network, client support, and&#13;
&#13;
                knowledge sharing. Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting at that period of time, as well, in â&#128;&#153;96, the&#13;
&#13;
                Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s organization is going through its own centralization. We had talked&#13;
&#13;
                earlier about having an IT group in the Loan Department, an IT group in the&#13;
&#13;
                Accounting Department and an IT group providing a central kind of operation;&#13;
&#13;
                those were all brought together in â&#128;&#153;96 in Controllers. In fact, I led the group that&#13;
&#13;
                did the study that recommended the centralization. And just as an aside, one of&#13;
&#13;
                the reasons why you could centralize then was Mike Ruddy had left the Bank. If&#13;
&#13;
                he had still been there, he would not have given up his developmental unit, his&#13;
&#13;
                IT resources. Basically the direction for creating an orderly environment and&#13;
&#13;
                expanding the capability to communicate to the field, to standardize and manage&#13;
&#13;
                the infrastructure, the Enterprise Network, upgrades on that, all this were&#13;
&#13;
                ongoing in this period as well. And in client support we extended the hours of&#13;
&#13;
                operation for a centralized help desk instead of a single day-shift. Much was&#13;
&#13;
                happening in this period of time prior to the formation of ISG. The work of the&#13;
&#13;
                prior studies, the efforts at consolidation and systemization of the organization,&#13;
&#13;
                all of that was in process.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I want to pick up on the thread of the five programs, particularly the technology&#13;
&#13;
                standardization. We tend to forget what the environment was like. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve said&#13;
&#13;
                here several times that one of the things that made the desktop environment, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                149&#13;
&amp;#12;                PCs, intractable is that they were bought by the local units and not managed in&#13;
&#13;
                any kind of central way right up to this time. This was still a serious problem.&#13;
&#13;
                As we mentioned, one of the KPMG recommendations was for proceeding with&#13;
&#13;
                some ideas that were on the table that were just being kicked around at that&#13;
&#13;
                point, which turned into an initiative called Desktop Reform. In 1997, we went&#13;
&#13;
                to the newly formed â&#128;&#147; there is â&#128;&#156;kind of got a "chicken and eggâ&#128;? problem about&#13;
&#13;
                what we talk about first here. I'm going to digress a moment. We were talking&#13;
&#13;
                about governance before. We also reformed governance at the exact time that&#13;
&#13;
                ISG was created. ITAC ceased to exist. A new committee called the ITSB, the&#13;
&#13;
                Information Technology Services Board was formed. I think either the last&#13;
&#13;
                meeting of ITAC or the first meeting of ITSB was devoted to approval of so-&#13;
&#13;
                called the Desktop Reform proposal, which was the next iteration of the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network and the replacement of all of the personal computers in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.    More important than simply replacing the hardware was a whole new&#13;
&#13;
                model for the way computers were provided. The so-called Corporate Computer&#13;
&#13;
                program, where the computers were provided by ISG. You donâ&#128;&#153;t buy them&#13;
&#13;
                yourself anymore. You want a computer, you get it from us. We give you a&#13;
&#13;
                standard computer equipped with standard software.      As George pointed out&#13;
&#13;
                earlier in one of our other sessions, the computers are locked down. They have&#13;
&#13;
                a precise configuration and youâ&#128;&#153;re not authorized to â&#128;&#147; the computer wonâ&#128;&#153;t let&#13;
&#13;
                you â&#128;&#147; modify this configuration. You have to have a particular code to be an&#13;
&#13;
                administrator of the computer before it will allow you to modify the&#13;
&#13;
                configuration. A lot of ITS information gets downloaded from the network. All&#13;
&#13;
                of that was put on the table in â&#128;&#153;97. We laid out a three-year plan for Desktop&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            150&#13;
&amp;#12;                Reform consisting of three phases. A couple of months ago we just finished the&#13;
&#13;
                end of Phase Three. Itâ&#128;&#153;s one of the most remarkable technological things Iâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                seen happen in the Bank. The fact that we were able to project something three&#13;
&#13;
                years in advance and actually do it was really remarkable, because things change&#13;
&#13;
                so much that you even forget. It was in 1997 that we went forward with the&#13;
&#13;
                proposal to implement what we had agreed to in the cost-effectiveness review,&#13;
&#13;
                which was this Desktop Reform and this next version of the Enterprise Network.&#13;
&#13;
                In 1996 we were grappling with the question of where do we go with the&#13;
&#13;
                Enterprise Network.       We had implemented EN1.05 which was based on&#13;
&#13;
                Windows and we had to move to this next version of Windows. We had to&#13;
&#13;
                decide what to do as Microsoft had various Windows platforms, Windows NT&#13;
&#13;
                and Windows â&#128;&#153;95. In the meantime, despite the fact that the Enterprise Network&#13;
&#13;
                was a great step forward in terms of standardization, the units still had their own&#13;
&#13;
                kind of version of it, so we werenâ&#128;&#153;t yet very standardized. It was with the&#13;
&#13;
                implementation of this next set of things, the Corporate Computer program,&#13;
&#13;
                EN2, Desktop Reform, that we really achieved these standardization promises&#13;
&#13;
                we made with KPMG. George mentioned earlier that one of the difficulties that&#13;
&#13;
                came back to bite us two years later was that in the conversation we had with&#13;
&#13;
                leadership in the Bank about the benefits weâ&#128;&#153;d be able to bring, there was some&#13;
&#13;
                double counting of the benefits. We had made some proposals first in the Ernst&#13;
&#13;
                &amp; Young study and later in the KPMG study, saying that we would - well now,&#13;
&#13;
                let me approach it a little differently - "if we can do the Systems Renewal&#13;
&#13;
                initiative and the things that are in the Ernst &amp; Young study we will save $10&#13;
&#13;
                million in ISG and $11 million in Operations." Independently the KPMG work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               151&#13;
&amp;#12;                arrives and we say, â&#128;&#156;If we do the things that are in this cost-effective review,&#13;
&#13;
                these are the amounts of money we can save.â&#128;? Some of those are the same&#13;
&#13;
                thing, that is to say, standardization of the systems groups is only going to save&#13;
&#13;
                the money once. But what ended up happening was that in the formulation of&#13;
&#13;
                this in CRM, the money got put in as double-counted. We were going to save it&#13;
&#13;
                twice. Somehow they thought that the KPMG cost-effectiveness review [said]&#13;
&#13;
                we were going to save $10 million and independently, if we did Systems&#13;
&#13;
                Renewal, weâ&#128;&#153;d save another $10 million. A lot of it was the same money. And,&#13;
&#13;
                furthermore, a lot of the savings that was supposed to come was supposed to&#13;
&#13;
                come in the units.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The business units, not in ISG.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Finally, one other element of this which needs to be said is that at the time we&#13;
&#13;
                made the proposals for savings which could be achieved in the systems units by&#13;
&#13;
                coalescing everything, as George pointed out. Before this actually happened,&#13;
&#13;
                Controllers did an organizational change of their own. The new head of that&#13;
&#13;
                consolidated group of Controllers took a lot of the savings. That is to say they&#13;
&#13;
                consolidated and reduced head count in Controllers before the people ever came&#13;
&#13;
                to ISG. So what we had expected to be able to do had already been done. The&#13;
&#13;
                savings had accrued to Controllers and then they gave us the unit that had been&#13;
&#13;
                consolidated.   But weâ&#128;&#153;re now on the hook to get the savings that we had&#13;
&#13;
                promised.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Would you like to add anything more on the Systems Renewal Initiative, which&#13;
&#13;
                is really at the heart of the Strategic Compact?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              152&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Let me add one thing that comes in this period of time as well and that is the&#13;
&#13;
                knowledge vision and the start of work on supporting the Knowledge Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                This was a totally new kind of agenda that did not require primarily technology&#13;
&#13;
                support. Technology was maybe 20 per cent of it. The real work on Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
                Management was with those business units generating, using and massaging the&#13;
&#13;
                information. And the first network that coalesced and started to make demands&#13;
&#13;
                on ITS was the Human Development Network. We were then asked to support&#13;
&#13;
                this activity which was really an un-funded mandate, if you will, but something&#13;
&#13;
                that matched the vision of the Knowledge Bank.                We undertook the&#13;
&#13;
                development of the Knowledge Bank and we devoted least five, six, maybe&#13;
&#13;
                more staff to this activity . There were also servers and other things that wound&#13;
&#13;
                up being involved, such as trying to build the basic tools.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      This was at the time when they launched the Networks in September of â&#128;&#153;97?&#13;
&#13;
                Are we talking about this time?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think some of this may have been in â&#128;&#153;97. We were in the R Building.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, I would say this is â&#128;&#153;96 and â&#128;&#153;97, yes. When the new President came, he&#13;
&#13;
                had his own change agenda and one of the first things he did was to form these&#13;
&#13;
                two big task forces led by Vice Presidents on how to make the Bank more&#13;
&#13;
                effective. Coming out of those task forces was the idea to create what were&#13;
&#13;
                initially called colleges and later called networks. And so, it was perhaps a full&#13;
&#13;
                year in the making. He came in mid-â&#128;&#153;95, right?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      June â&#128;&#153;95.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s mid -â&#128;&#153;96 at the time I think when the HD network starts getting formed.&#13;
&#13;
                Chit Tharnthong and Ramesh Siva and those guys start working on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              153&#13;
&amp;#12;                Knowledge Bank during the latter half of â&#128;&#153;96 and the early part of â&#128;&#153;97 It was&#13;
&#13;
                very interesting because the lessons we learned about building the technology&#13;
&#13;
                underpinnings of a knowledge program, we learned the hard way, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
                We learned by making mistakes.         They built what they called the KMS&#13;
&#13;
                (Knowledge Management System). Intellectually it was fabulous work that they&#13;
&#13;
                did. But they quickly realized that the difficulty was you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t really manage&#13;
&#13;
                a bunch of web pages that had information of this kind. It was beastly difficult;&#13;
&#13;
                you had to go through all of these shenanigans and you had to have people&#13;
&#13;
                somewhere who knew how to do this and kind of hammer out this HTML. They&#13;
&#13;
                quickly realized even in terms of the technology underpinnings if they could get&#13;
&#13;
                the networks to focus on what were the objects which were knowledge objects,&#13;
&#13;
                we still had this incredibly difficult problem of how do we make that stuff&#13;
&#13;
                available on the web. How do we let people sit at their desk, create some&#13;
&#13;
                document, which represents Bank knowledge, and provide that into the&#13;
&#13;
                machinery in such a way that it was available to the rest of the Bank? Without&#13;
&#13;
                having had some human being take this document and go through it and put&#13;
&#13;
                HTML tags in it? How do you put this into a search engine? How do you make&#13;
&#13;
                it possible to capture a keyword associated with it? How do you profile the&#13;
&#13;
                document? How do you capture the metadata? How do manage all of that?&#13;
&#13;
                How do you manage the documentâ&#128;&#153;s aging? They started out just kind of&#13;
&#13;
                hammering a bunch of stuff together in Human Development and quickly&#13;
&#13;
                learned some really wonderful lessons. Again, I think fairly early in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
                way the world itself was evolving with these subjects, I think once again the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank was fortunate in being pretty far along.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              154&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       One of the other lessons that learned here is that this was a different world.&#13;
&#13;
                This was not the world of â&#128;&#156;gather the requirements, fully design it and&#13;
&#13;
                implement it.â&#128;?      This was some of the aspects of the rapid application&#13;
&#13;
                development: prototype, try it, but not try and fully design this thing overall. It&#13;
&#13;
                is a highly complex problem; we are still having some of these issues. This is a&#13;
&#13;
                major change for the organization. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s an Intranet, too, and I can recall&#13;
&#13;
                when we shifted buildings over to the S Building and were grappling with the&#13;
&#13;
                annual update of the Intranet and the Extranet, as well. The Extranet tended to&#13;
&#13;
                get a new face at the time of the Annual Meetings.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Actually, we should use the word â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m the one that said it but Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to&#13;
&#13;
                correct myself.    We shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t refer to our presence on the Internet as the&#13;
&#13;
                Extranet. Actually, George mentioned Chit and Ramensh were the authors of a&#13;
&#13;
                of a paper on the way the Bank should approach networks and have a presence&#13;
&#13;
                in the network world. They wrote this paper, this service judging paper, which&#13;
&#13;
                laid out a set of definitions that have come to be, I think, more or less, adopted&#13;
&#13;
                by everyone now. I donâ&#128;&#153;t mean to imply that they made up these words for the&#13;
&#13;
                world, but they were early adopters of the words, which came to have this&#13;
&#13;
                meaning throughout the world, which is that I think we tend to use the word&#13;
&#13;
                Extranet to describe an external presence to which we invite the participation of&#13;
&#13;
                closed committees. Not the entire 200 million Internet users, but hereâ&#128;&#153;s a set of&#13;
&#13;
                material and discussion groups and whatnot where we have people inside and&#13;
&#13;
                outside the Bank who are able to interact in one of these Extranet communities.&#13;
&#13;
                We tend to use the word Internet, â&#128;&#156;our Internet presenceâ&#128;?, to mean that part of&#13;
&#13;
                our external face that we make available to 200 million or whatever the number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               155&#13;
&amp;#12;                is this week. And then of course Intranet. So what we were revamping and&#13;
&#13;
                have revamped several times is our external web presence as distinct from the&#13;
&#13;
                so-called Extranet.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      So how did the formation of ISG come about? And, how did it fit with the&#13;
&#13;
                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s agenda on policy, strategy and standards affecting information&#13;
&#13;
                technology?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I guess my answer to that is this is the coalescing of all of these ideas with the&#13;
&#13;
                organization construct that manages it.            We talked about the governance&#13;
&#13;
                activities. We talked about strategy from a five-phase program standpoint of&#13;
&#13;
                standardization, the global network and client support, knowledge sharing. I&#13;
&#13;
                forgot what the fifth one is but . . . those are . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Business systems.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Business systems, OK.         Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the SAP, the Enterprise Business Systems.&#13;
&#13;
                Standardization runs across the board here. We talked about the idea of Buy vs.&#13;
&#13;
                Build being recommended a few years earlier. Previously, if you recall, we&#13;
&#13;
                were talking about internal programmers developing systems supporting the&#13;
&#13;
                business units of the Bank. Now weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about buying commercial off-&#13;
&#13;
                the-shelf software. The ERP implementation that allows us to use standard&#13;
&#13;
                business models and not to have to create the code that matches an internal&#13;
&#13;
                business process but to adopt the best practice business process.        And the&#13;
&#13;
                standardization on the desktop, i.e. that everyone has the same image, everyone&#13;
&#13;
                has the same piece of hardware, standard software that we can manage. This all&#13;
&#13;
                comes together with an organization, ISG, to manage and oversee it and carry it&#13;
&#13;
                forward.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              156&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      How would you describe information technology governance today in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
                How far have we come?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting, the transition from the last question to this question, because you&#13;
&#13;
                were asking before how do we fit with the evolution of the Bank. Our evolution&#13;
&#13;
                matched their evolution. At the risk of repeating myself, I want to take this&#13;
&#13;
                question in the context of the evolution throughout corporate America and&#13;
&#13;
                perhaps the world of the recognition of IT as being a corporate strategic issue.&#13;
&#13;
                Our evolution and the evolution of IT governance map very closely onto that&#13;
&#13;
                emerging recognition, that we have to look at IT corporately as opposed to&#13;
&#13;
                departmentally or regionally, or what have you. Should we adopt a global&#13;
&#13;
                approach to the communications network or a regional one. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about&#13;
&#13;
                that right?&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Yes, weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       OK, well I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s an example and there are other examples. Actually we&#13;
&#13;
                talked earlier today about IRIS, which is another example where there was this&#13;
&#13;
                issue of this growing awareness that we need to be able to make corporate&#13;
&#13;
                decisions. And Systems Renewal is yet another one of those.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How does the Information Policy Council, formed in September of 2000,&#13;
&#13;
                enhance that?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Thatâ&#128;&#153;s actually kind of a culmination of the growing awareness. I think of the&#13;
&#13;
                Information Policy Council as being an outgrowth of recognition that we got a&#13;
&#13;
                lot better decision-making about corporate systems by the formation of a group&#13;
&#13;
                around the business process owners. It was a lesson that came home hard to us&#13;
&#13;
                during the Systems Renewal. As somebody who is part of IT, Iâ&#128;&#153;m suspicious of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 157&#13;
&amp;#12;                my own perceptions of this area. Historically, we believe that we have always&#13;
&#13;
                reached out to the business people, trying to get them to pay attention to this&#13;
&#13;
                stuff and that we canâ&#128;&#153;t attract their interest. At the same time I think perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s a perception among the business people that maybe we didnâ&#128;&#153;t reach out&#13;
&#13;
                as much as we thought we did.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Or earlier.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       There is room for plenty of different points of view about this. But it was clear&#13;
&#13;
                to everyone there needed to be more participation from people who were in&#13;
&#13;
                control of business processes in the application of technology to automating&#13;
&#13;
                those business processes. We werenâ&#128;&#153;t successful as a Bank in causing that to&#13;
&#13;
                happen until Systems Renewal. In fact, we were not even successful at the&#13;
&#13;
                beginning of Systems Renewal. I regard Systems Renewal as having been&#13;
&#13;
                extremely successful when measured in terms of delivery on time, delivery&#13;
&#13;
                according to plan. Even if it â&#128;&#147; I mean certainly it did â&#128;&#147; run over budget in terms&#13;
&#13;
                of the change of management activities.       Certainly there was much backlash&#13;
&#13;
                about the systems and the weaknesses in the user interface and perhaps some&#13;
&#13;
                choices we made. By and large the whole thing had been very successful. One&#13;
&#13;
                of the things that perhaps was not successful was the fact that we had a very&#13;
&#13;
                difficult time in the early stages getting the business sponsors to focus on the&#13;
&#13;
                blueprinting phase. When the time comes in the evolution of all of this to get&#13;
&#13;
                business people in to say, â&#128;&#156;how do we want these systems to work?â&#128;? that was&#13;
&#13;
                where everything went off the rails. We had to pay them to come in and even&#13;
&#13;
                with our paying them to come and to do it, even with our paying for their time&#13;
&#13;
                we were not able to attract peopleâ&#128;&#153;s attention. Itâ&#128;&#153;s so much a part of the fabric of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                158&#13;
&amp;#12;                IT everywhere. People are too busy to pay attention until the systems have&#13;
&#13;
                come out. Once theyâ&#128;&#153;ve come out, then theyâ&#128;&#153;ve got all the time to complain&#13;
&#13;
                about the fact that the systems donâ&#128;&#153;t really meet their requirements. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure&#13;
&#13;
                there were things we could have done better. When everything gets compressed&#13;
&#13;
                and we end up having to get all of the code written in a very small period of time&#13;
&#13;
                because the business people continue to change the requirements up until the last&#13;
&#13;
                minute and the price that was paid for that, because the absolute end date was&#13;
&#13;
                fixed.   The price that was paid was in training development and change&#13;
&#13;
                management. You clearly canâ&#128;&#153;t do those things until you write the code. And&#13;
&#13;
                you canâ&#128;&#153;t write the code until you have the specifications pinned down from the&#13;
&#13;
                business people. We ended up compressing the schedule; the price that was paid&#13;
&#13;
                was on effective training.&#13;
&#13;
                Sorry, I got a little bit off the topic here, but the lesson we learned in the middle&#13;
&#13;
                of all of this is that we canâ&#128;&#153;t do this without active involvement from these&#13;
&#13;
                business sponsors. Somewhere in the middle of the effort, Fayez Choudhury,&#13;
&#13;
                the Director of Accounting, now the Controller, who â&#128;&#147; recall earlier comments&#13;
&#13;
                about the degree to which the Accounting Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s control of information&#13;
&#13;
                systems prior to systems renewal was regarded by many other people as being a&#13;
&#13;
                stranglehold on the systems â&#128;¦ The Accounting Departmentâ&#128;&#153;s perception of this&#13;
&#13;
                probably is that they were in their role as the Controller able to ensure that the&#13;
&#13;
                systems did a good job fulfilling their obligations, the Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s obligations.&#13;
&#13;
                However they perceived it, they certainly were not initially in favor of what&#13;
&#13;
                ultimately became the Systems Renewal. We were well into it before, despite&#13;
&#13;
                all of Mohamed Muhsinâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to try to build bridges and build consensus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 159&#13;
&amp;#12;                with everyone, Fayez stopped lobbing grenades at us and actually got in there&#13;
&#13;
                and started providing the benefit of his considerable intellectual gifts and his&#13;
&#13;
                support and advice to try and make the thing a success. When he did and when&#13;
&#13;
                Achim von Heynitz and Kathy Sierra came in and tried to make it a success,&#13;
&#13;
                boy, that was when it really took off. And so a lesson from that was that you&#13;
&#13;
                had to have these people in up to their eyeballs. By the end of the systems&#13;
&#13;
                renewal, they were in it up to their eyeballs! Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what evolved into the&#13;
&#13;
                Information Policy Council.        Itâ&#128;&#153;s just those business sponsors.    Mohamed&#13;
&#13;
                Muhsin is a very inclusive guy and he brought other important people that had a&#13;
&#13;
                stake, and so now the Information Policy Council is exactly that; the business&#13;
&#13;
                process owners controlling the agenda. You know people think that the IT&#13;
&#13;
                organization doesnâ&#128;&#153;t want that. They think that we are anxious to try to drive&#13;
&#13;
                this from the technological perspective, but thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the case. They are our&#13;
&#13;
                drivers; they are our clients. They are the business.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      OK, now would you like to talk about chargeback?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, I think weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about it a lot already. Itâ&#128;&#153;s actually interesting because&#13;
&#13;
                I believe that one of the recommendations in the KPMG study was to simplify&#13;
&#13;
                chargeback.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well what impact does it continue to have on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s experience with&#13;
&#13;
                technology?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We havenâ&#128;&#153;t yet talked about the Master Service Level Agreement, which is an&#13;
&#13;
                important topic. I think that we have made a material shift coming into this year&#13;
&#13;
                in the approach to the funding of IT. Now this work started I would say in 1998,&#13;
&#13;
                might have been â&#128;&#153;99. It was the first time that we said to the ITSB and to others&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                160&#13;
&amp;#12;                that weâ&#128;&#153;ve managed to get ourselves into a situation in which the mechanisms&#13;
&#13;
                we use to fund IT, information and technology, are inappropriate to the role that&#13;
&#13;
                we want IT to play as a corporate matter. George referred earlier to the fact that&#13;
&#13;
                we were trying to sell IRIS door-to-door. We were in to this situation because in&#13;
&#13;
                order to get this thing going forward, Flavia had built it up in this guerrilla&#13;
&#13;
                warfare fashion from the ground up and sold it to â&#128;&#147; we had maybe 3,000 users.&#13;
&#13;
                But where we were trying to sell each individual CAO, each individual region&#13;
&#13;
                on the idea that they needed to do document management, some of them werenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                going to buy it, particularly in those very constrained budget times a couple&#13;
&#13;
                years ago. We couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get forward with that, and we had no way of funding&#13;
&#13;
                what was effectively a corporate initiative.      We managed to get corporate&#13;
&#13;
                attention focused on Systems Renewal, primarily because of our fortuitous&#13;
&#13;
                juxtaposition of events with the Strategic Compact. We got the money. Here&#13;
&#13;
                we were in â&#128;&#152;00, ready with another set of initiatives to take us into the next step.&#13;
&#13;
                The business sponsors by-and-large were in support of putting more money into&#13;
&#13;
                further building these systems. But again, we donâ&#128;&#153;t really know quite how to&#13;
&#13;
                approach that from a corporate funding point of view. We did very well, I think,&#13;
&#13;
                in standardizing the base-level infrastructure, but there were still a whole set of&#13;
&#13;
                issues around the way the money works for that. People are paying us. And&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re generating sub-optimal behavior in a lot of cases. People are wanting to&#13;
&#13;
                play games with the system.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How did chargeback modify organizational behavior?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       People will always try to find ways to reduce their bill. Here we are in an&#13;
&#13;
                organization that is dominated by economists. Giles Hopkins is fond of saying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                161&#13;
&amp;#12;                that economists will always game this thing. Whichever argument theyâ&#128;&#153;re trying&#13;
&#13;
                to make, they will argue cross-subsidization when it suits their purposes or they&#13;
&#13;
                will argue leveraging the benefits of organizational decision-making when it&#13;
&#13;
                suits their interest. We continued to fight with these things, right up until the&#13;
&#13;
                beginning of this year. When we agreed to the rates for I think it was FY â&#128;&#153;99,&#13;
&#13;
                we had a very difficult time with the ITSB on the rates. In part, because we had&#13;
&#13;
                to go to them with some changes in the way the rate structure worked for&#13;
&#13;
                Central Help Desk support. And the ITSB felt that we were putting a bunch of&#13;
&#13;
                stuff on chargeback previously institutionally funded. Now, in fact we werenâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                doing that, but it was symptomatic of the Bank-wide view that we were always&#13;
&#13;
                playing games with this chargeback stuff. Every time we had to take a budget&#13;
&#13;
                cut, we raised our rates in order to solve the problem. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t true and in fact&#13;
&#13;
                we took over $11 million worth of budget cuts over the period from â&#128;&#153;97 to â&#128;&#153;99.&#13;
&#13;
                Furthermore, chargeback was incredibly complex when you tried to dig into it.&#13;
&#13;
                Whenever we would invite people to look at the books, they would think that it&#13;
&#13;
                would be a good thing to do; but the minute they would look at it. they would&#13;
&#13;
                start saying that we were playing games, again because of its complexity. Part&#13;
&#13;
                of the reason the history of all this money and the organizational shifts in IRMD,&#13;
&#13;
                GSD, ITF. Then we consolidated all the systems groups, did Systems Renewal,&#13;
&#13;
                and cut all this stuff.    There was a set of institutional money around the&#13;
&#13;
                information programs running the Record Centers and the Libraries and all that.&#13;
&#13;
                There were three different colors of money: the BB administrative budget which&#13;
&#13;
                some parts of our organization got money for; chargeback money; and managed&#13;
&#13;
                overhead money, which we had for some things. These different kinds of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              162&#13;
&amp;#12;                money werenâ&#128;&#153;t fungible with one another. There were some things you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                buy with some kinds of money.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       We complicated that with capital budget, too.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       There was also the capital budget. Coming into that argument about the Central&#13;
&#13;
                Help Desk was a recognition by us and by the ITSB that we really needed to&#13;
&#13;
                step back and take a big look at this whole thing. CRM was asked to lead this&#13;
&#13;
                effort. They brought a consultant from outside, Joan Beltzer from Credit Suisse&#13;
&#13;
                in Geneva to lead this effort for CRM and work with us. We formed committees&#13;
&#13;
                and we studied it and we looked at how the money worked and made a set of&#13;
&#13;
                recommendations for simplification of the whole chargeback system. Basically,&#13;
&#13;
                the idea was to recognize that there was a set of services of IT services that&#13;
&#13;
                needed to be provided to every employee of the Bank as a part of the cost of&#13;
&#13;
                doing business for which there was no benefit whatever to having that be on any&#13;
&#13;
                kind of a chargeback basis.        The way the money actually flowed was an&#13;
&#13;
                independent matter from whether or not this was a subject of local manager&#13;
&#13;
                discretion. The important point was there was no choice. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t choose&#13;
&#13;
                to have or not have electronic mail or an office suite or a telephone. That was&#13;
&#13;
                what we came to call Basic Services. And everybody got it. Furthermore, in the&#13;
&#13;
                analysis of this, we recognized that truthfully this stuff has very low long-run&#13;
&#13;
                marginal cost. The increment associated with one more unit of this is virtually&#13;
&#13;
                zero. Itâ&#128;&#153;s going to cost us a certain amount of money to deliver 12,000 units of&#13;
&#13;
                this. And whether itâ&#128;&#153;s 12,100 or 12,700 or 11,800 doesnâ&#128;&#153;t matter a bit to us.&#13;
&#13;
                The only piece of that that physically matters is the number of actual computers&#13;
&#13;
                we have to buy. But beyond that, the marginal cost is almost zero.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            163&#13;
&amp;#12;                What we came to recognize is that at the beginning of the year, we needed to&#13;
&#13;
                agree inside the Bank that weâ&#128;&#153;re going to deliver more or less 12,000, or 11,000&#13;
&#13;
                thousand units or whatever the number is. And this is the set of services that the&#13;
&#13;
                business people think need to be in there as well as the level of service. Then&#13;
&#13;
                we agree on what the price for that is and what the cost for that is in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                And then we set that money aside, however we do that. Whether the money&#13;
&#13;
                actually sits with them, or sits with CRM or sits with us is a different issue.&#13;
&#13;
                Then independent of that, there is the so-called Optional Services, which&#13;
&#13;
                includes luxury things. If you want to have a big monitor, if you want to have&#13;
&#13;
                caller ID on your telephone or you want to have matters of choice . . .&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       On top of the standard.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Including things like long-distance telephone. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s your usage space. The&#13;
&#13;
                pass-through stuff. And cell phones fall into that category. There was not really&#13;
&#13;
                much value added from us getting in the middle of this whole cell phone thing.,&#13;
&#13;
                which was to be able to get a cell phone and pay for it with your â&#128;&#156;Pâ&#128;? card.&#13;
&#13;
                Those are the so-called Optional Services, which are are matters of management&#13;
&#13;
                discretion. We ended up putting the whole computer thing in there too. The&#13;
&#13;
                actual box. The actual piece of hardware because the truth is, you get the basic&#13;
&#13;
                service but you have to supply a computer. What was actually happening is&#13;
&#13;
                people would have a desktop here, a desktop there, a laptop for this guy,&#13;
&#13;
                something at home for somebody. We ended up making it an option. You pay a&#13;
&#13;
                discretionary basis for each piece of hardware that you get. But you get a set of&#13;
&#13;
                accounts and stuff like that, that goes with the person. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s part of Basic&#13;
&#13;
                Services. But the actual piece of hardware, you choose whether you want&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                desktops or laptops or ultra-lites or whatever. Then there was a third set of&#13;
&#13;
                things, which was the Corporate Services. Weâ&#128;&#153;ll come back to this.&#13;

McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                          165&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Good morning, Iâ&#128;&#153;m Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
                Today is November 29, 2001. Weâ&#128;&#153;re back here for our fourth session on the&#13;
&#13;
                evolution of technology applications at the World Bank with Messrs. William&#13;
&#13;
                McDonald (Dee) Buck and George W. West. Also with me is Professor Becker&#13;
&#13;
                from the Business History Group and George Washington University. In the&#13;
&#13;
                last session we were talking about the chargeback and its effect on modifying&#13;
&#13;
                organizational behavior. Mr. Buck covered ISGâ&#128;&#153;s Optional Services and was&#13;
&#13;
                talking about Corporate Services, so we will ask him to continue on with that.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We were talking about the recognition in the Bank that the services we provide&#13;
&#13;
                in chargeback are not all uniformly discretionary and chargeback as a&#13;
&#13;
                mechanism for the transfer of resources from operational units to backline units&#13;
&#13;
                who were providing services might work better if we had a better understanding&#13;
&#13;
                of the relationship between discretion and the provision of these services. We&#13;
&#13;
                chose to divide all our service goals into four parts, if you will, including Basic&#13;
&#13;
                Services provided to all staff and Optional Services, which are completely&#13;
&#13;
                within manager discretion.         I was about to talk about Corporate Services.&#13;
&#13;
                Before starting that Iâ&#128;&#153;ll just briefly mention the fourth category called Custom&#13;
&#13;
                Services. Custom Services are intended to represent relationships between the&#13;
&#13;
                central IT organization and consumer organizations, front-line organizations that&#13;
&#13;
                may require special purpose assistance from us for which theyâ&#128;&#153;re willing to pay.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       One good example would be the Health Services Department which has a Health&#13;
&#13;
                Services application that requires a high degree of confidentiality and operates&#13;
&#13;
                on an independent server. We set up an agreement with the Health Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               166&#13;
&amp;#12;                Department to provide the infrastructure support for that application and the&#13;
&#13;
                server it resides on, which would be a Custom Service.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       The structure of the Basic Services arrangement calls for local units to provide&#13;
&#13;
                some degree of local support; that is, they have people on their own staff who&#13;
&#13;
                assist the local working people with the use of the technology. We can enter&#13;
&#13;
                into custom arrangements with individual Vice Presidencies under which we&#13;
&#13;
                provide that service on their behalf on a contract basis.. They can choose to do&#13;
&#13;
                it themselves or to contract with us to do it and we do that for a quite a number&#13;
&#13;
                of organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Another example would be with the Finance Complex, Treasury Department,&#13;
&#13;
                which runs applications that are unique to that part of the Bank where we&#13;
&#13;
                provide the infrastructure services for them. We have a comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
                We operate the server farm, if you will, and have procedures in place. They are&#13;
&#13;
                a much smaller unit and the comparative advantage is just not there and in the&#13;
&#13;
                last couple of years theyâ&#128;&#153;ve come I think to seeing this (ISG infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
                support) as an advantage.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Another distinction that may be useful is that you may think of Basic Services as&#13;
&#13;
                services we provide to an individual, a set of accounts and an ability to work.&#13;
&#13;
                Optional Services also by and large are services to individuals. Custom Services&#13;
&#13;
                are in general services we deliver to an entire Vice Presidency. A service level&#13;
&#13;
                agreement, a particular agreement that we enter into, stipulates what they get,&#13;
&#13;
                what they pay, what the service levels are and what they can expect. Now, that&#13;
&#13;
                leads us to the third category, which is called Corporate Services. Earlier in the&#13;
&#13;
                discussion I was talking about the realization over the last few years of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              167&#13;
&amp;#12;                evolution of IT as a vehicle for strategic advantage in the organization. Not only&#13;
&#13;
                here but everywhere else in the world. George and I both made reference to one&#13;
&#13;
                of the challenges weâ&#128;&#153;ve had over the last five years is trying to arrange for&#13;
&#13;
                senior management to make corporate decisions about the application of IT to&#13;
&#13;
                the entire organization, the entire enterprise, in cases where local optimization,&#13;
&#13;
                local autonomy, local decision-making wasnâ&#128;&#153;t necessarily in the best interests of&#13;
&#13;
                the organization. The provision of a service category called Corporate Services&#13;
&#13;
                in the Master Service Level Agreement is aimed directly at this aspect. These&#13;
&#13;
                are services that the corporate body, the enterprise, decides upon, makes&#13;
&#13;
                decisions upon and makes investments in. The most obvious of these was&#13;
&#13;
                Systems Renewal where the institution at large made a decision that we were&#13;
&#13;
                going to invest in a corporate-wide information system that would benefit&#13;
&#13;
                everyone. From a chargeback perspective thereâ&#128;&#153;s little to be gained by levying a&#13;
&#13;
                charge on each individual person. You have to somehow arrange for the money&#13;
&#13;
                to flow to the people that have to deliver the services that need to be done. If&#13;
&#13;
                youâ&#128;&#153;re in Corporate Resource Management, you probably are also interested in&#13;
&#13;
                ensuring that the cost of providing those services is appropriately placed on the&#13;
&#13;
                end-user units in some way so that we can accurately measure what it costs to&#13;
&#13;
                deliver, say, the South Asia work program, including all of the overhead&#13;
&#13;
                involved with the systems. So in some way you want the costs to show up there&#13;
&#13;
                but chargeback probably isnâ&#128;&#153;t the right way to do that.&#13;
&#13;
                So, with this set of realizations, Corporate Services is that set of principally&#13;
&#13;
                information systems and information delivery vehicles provided as infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
                but paid for through some corporate allocation. There is a lot of similarity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              168&#13;
&amp;#12;                conceptually between Corporate Information Services and Basic Information&#13;
&#13;
                Services, the Basic Services that we started with. In both cases thereâ&#128;&#153;s not much&#13;
&#13;
                management discretion. The difference is that Basic Services are first of all&#13;
&#13;
                quite uniform. The dialogue we have with the institution about the level of&#13;
&#13;
                Basic Services we are going to provide tends to be one of level-setting. What&#13;
&#13;
                level of richness of the environment is appropriate for us to provide? At what&#13;
&#13;
                point do we cease to add value to individual staff in proportion to the costs?&#13;
&#13;
                And do we get into â&#128;&#156;gold-platingâ&#128;?, or something? The World Bank wants to&#13;
&#13;
                provide a suitable environment but not a rich environment. In the Corporate&#13;
&#13;
                Services, the dialogue is different. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s an endless amount of things that we&#13;
&#13;
                could probably invest in. But we have to invest in the most important of those.&#13;
&#13;
                The kind of discussion we have with the corporate customer is very different.&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s one of priority setting. It is characterized by business sponsors in individual&#13;
&#13;
                units who want the corporate body to invest in better systems for the conduct of&#13;
&#13;
                our business process.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      That are more aligned with the strategy of the institution, if you will?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       It can be, yes, although sometimes itâ&#128;&#153;s very backroom in nature. For example,&#13;
&#13;
                investments in better ledger systems.      You can argue that they benefit the&#13;
&#13;
                institution at large or you can argue that they benefit principally the Accounting&#13;
&#13;
                Department. But they are a necessary part of doing business. Nevertheless, we&#13;
&#13;
                are called upon to decide whether or not we are going to invest in improvements&#13;
&#13;
                to the accounting system as contrasted with improvements in the operational&#13;
&#13;
                systems that support management and lending. Or whether weâ&#128;&#153;re going to&#13;
&#13;
                invest in better systems for the management of document creation for frontline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                169&#13;
&amp;#12;                staff building a memorandum to the President, or something. So itâ&#128;&#153;s the nature&#13;
&#13;
                of the dialogue and the specificity of the interests. If we have a conversation&#13;
&#13;
                about whether or not to make investments in better budgeting systems, this is not&#13;
&#13;
                a conversation we can have with the totality of the Bank. You canâ&#128;&#153;t walk into&#13;
&#13;
                an ordinary operational division and have a conversation about whether or not&#13;
&#13;
                we should make investments in the budgeting system because they donâ&#128;&#153;t know&#13;
&#13;
                enough about it. The locality of understanding of the systems is very narrow;&#13;
&#13;
                whereas when you contrast that with the Basic Services where you can have a&#13;
&#13;
                conversation about whether or not we should provide laptops to anyone in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank â&#128;&#147; everybody has an opinion. Therefore the way we approach trying to get&#13;
&#13;
                resolution on the issue is different. In Basic Services we are aiming to get a&#13;
&#13;
                cross-section of the Bank represented in a Committee called the ITSB&#13;
&#13;
                (Information Technology Services Board) who on behalf of the end-user&#13;
&#13;
                population of the Bank try to arrive at whatâ&#128;&#153;s the right balance between better&#13;
&#13;
                tools for individual productivity vs. cost. Whereas in a different committee, the&#13;
&#13;
                Information Policy Council, we have this dialogue about the relative priority of&#13;
&#13;
                systems investments that we could make to improve our business process in&#13;
&#13;
                which the advocate for improvement in a particular business process is not ISG,&#13;
&#13;
                but the business sponsor who provides the service to the institution by way of&#13;
&#13;
                technology. So you see these are quite different in a way although from the&#13;
&#13;
                perspective of the relevance of chargeback, theyâ&#128;&#153;re quite similar. In both cases,&#13;
&#13;
                what really makes sense is for the institution to decide how much it wants to&#13;
&#13;
                invest and how itâ&#128;&#153;s going to arrange for the funding to flow and then just to set&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             170&#13;
&amp;#12;                that money aside. And we need to get out of the business of â&#128;&#156;onesy, twoseyâ&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                monthly billing kind of nonsense.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       One complicating factor in this, and I think Dee has put the emphasis in the right&#13;
&#13;
                place, is that it is essentially the business units of the Bank that collectively, at a&#13;
&#13;
                high level, are determining priorities and matching that with institutional&#13;
&#13;
                priorities. ISG gets into this in a way, also, in that when there are institutional&#13;
&#13;
                issues such as SAP, upgrades to SAP, which then cut across the Bank, these are&#13;
&#13;
                also thrown into the mix of things that have to be decided from a Bank-wide&#13;
&#13;
                investment perspective and an institutional priority standpoint because these are&#13;
&#13;
                not low-cost changes. When the Bank invests in an upgrade to a large-scale&#13;
&#13;
                ERP system, such as SAP, these investments are normally in the $1 million&#13;
&#13;
                category. The business units then have to see that that upgrade fits in from a&#13;
&#13;
                priority standpoint with the other competing interests.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;d like to return to your original question, which was how this modifies&#13;
&#13;
                organizational behavior. I think whatâ&#128;&#153;s happened here is we went off on a&#13;
&#13;
                tangent to try to explain the Master Service Level Agreement which is an&#13;
&#13;
                important to understand. The reason for implementing the Master Service Level&#13;
&#13;
                Agreement was to change organizational behavior. In the course of the last&#13;
&#13;
                several years organizational behavior has been â&#128;&#147; Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure what word Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
                looking for â&#128;&#147; there is a pathology to this. When people begin to operate in a&#13;
&#13;
                local level under budget pressure in ways that seem to them to be conserving&#13;
&#13;
                resources but in the global view are in fact not conserving resources, weâ&#128;&#153;ve been&#13;
&#13;
                very concerned about that.         A couple of examples of behavior that are&#13;
&#13;
                illustrative of this point. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been the case over the course of the last â&#128;&#147; I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   171&#13;
&amp;#12;                know â&#128;&#147; maybe even ten years that organizations are actively trying to manage&#13;
&#13;
                their financial resources during the course of the year to protect against running&#13;
&#13;
                out of money. Near the end of the year it turns out they have extra resources and&#13;
&#13;
                thus there is this enormous frenzy to try to spend the rest of the money because&#13;
&#13;
                of the presumption that if you consistently under-spend allocated resources,&#13;
&#13;
                theyâ&#128;&#153;ll be taken away from you. Over the course of the last ten years people&#13;
&#13;
                have seen technology as an ideal location for flushing those resources at the end&#13;
&#13;
                of the year. They buy laptops; they buy equipment. To a large measure our&#13;
&#13;
                moving towards the Corporate Computer program has cut that off because&#13;
&#13;
                buying equipment is no longer a vehicle for them to use this as a way to flush&#13;
&#13;
                their resources. Flush is probably the wrong word here. I mean â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      To use up.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Use up, use up. Another area is in usersâ&#128;&#153; organizations in the last few years&#13;
&#13;
                there has been a lot of argument back and forth about the way we measured the&#13;
&#13;
                number of units of service that we provide. Take for example these Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
                Network connections that we have. For some time we used to measure how&#13;
&#13;
                many of those you were charged for on the basis of how many outlets there were&#13;
&#13;
                in the wall. That created behavior in which people would try to minimize the&#13;
&#13;
                number of those outlets that they were being charged for by various kinds of&#13;
&#13;
                dodges. There was a flurry of activity about outlets in conference rooms, for&#13;
&#13;
                example. People would ask us to put an outlet in a conference room in advance&#13;
&#13;
                of some meeting and then after the meeting was over theyâ&#128;&#153;d call us to remove it&#13;
&#13;
                out to avoid being billed for it! My point here is that overall thatâ&#128;&#153;s wasteful of&#13;
&#13;
                resources. And yet you can understand on a local level why they donâ&#128;&#153;t want to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              172&#13;
&amp;#12;                pay for that outlet. At one point we agreed to outfit all the conference rooms&#13;
&#13;
                with outlets and roll that cost into the cost of everyoneâ&#128;&#153;s services. But you know&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s a limit to how much of that you can do as that results in the overall costs&#13;
&#13;
                continuing to rise and people then start asking about whatâ&#128;&#153;s embedded in these&#13;
&#13;
                costs and how we can reduce them.&#13;
&#13;
                A third example is after we had grappled with this issue about the number of&#13;
&#13;
                outlets in the wall we then, with agreement from everyone, changed the&#13;
&#13;
                algorithm. We would measure the number of people that were in the Human&#13;
&#13;
                Resources system and would bill for that many people. We would recalibrate&#13;
&#13;
                the cost per unit based on the expected number of people we thought there&#13;
&#13;
                would be. So there was an apparent price increase because the number of&#13;
&#13;
                people was lot less than the number of outlets. Instead of billing for 12,000&#13;
&#13;
                outlets we were billing for 8,000 people but for the same aggregate amount of&#13;
&#13;
                money. Then the behavior that emerged was people argued about whether or&#13;
&#13;
                not we would charge for short-term consultants, part-time staff. â&#128;&#156;Oh, I have this&#13;
&#13;
                consultant and he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t really use this or that or the other. All he really wants&#13;
&#13;
                is a mail account. Canâ&#128;&#153;t we just get a mail account and not get an Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
                Network Account?â&#128;? Or, â&#128;&#156;He brings his own laptop in.â&#128;? Again, we start having&#13;
&#13;
                these kinds of conversations with people trying to optimize on the margin not&#13;
&#13;
                recognizing that all that really happens is if we optimize this is the relative&#13;
&#13;
                proportion of the total costs moves around among the units. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a fixed cost to&#13;
&#13;
                do the work and so what weâ&#128;&#153;re arguing about is if I can successfully argue that&#13;
&#13;
                you shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t charge me for this unit then in effect the cost of that just moves to&#13;
&#13;
                other people and they behave the same way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               173&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       I think one interpretation is that you are in an organization that is composed&#13;
&#13;
                primarily of economists.      And Iâ&#128;&#153;m not an economist so I can talk about&#13;
&#13;
                economists. [Laughs] And here pricing mechanisms and marginal costs are&#13;
&#13;
                stock in trade!&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Right, and markets.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       And markets. These people are experts in these areas. So how it appears from&#13;
&#13;
                the technology perspective is that when you set up a system to deal with an&#13;
&#13;
                entire organization in an equitable manner, there is always gaming of the&#13;
&#13;
                systems to try and achieve some marginal advantage. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what Dee has been&#13;
&#13;
                talking about.    I do see a kind of trend here; there is less of that as a result of&#13;
&#13;
                standardization, as a result of more consistent pricing and now as a result of this&#13;
&#13;
                Master Service Level Agreement.           In the past, the business units with&#13;
&#13;
                technology expertise were providers of services themselves.           And with the&#13;
&#13;
                appointment of the CIO and the consolidation and the support side, I see the&#13;
&#13;
                trend that the Vice Presidential Units are moving toward the basic support, at&#13;
&#13;
                least, to be provided by the Center.       The technology support staff may be&#13;
&#13;
                physically located in the business units but they would be staffed by or would be&#13;
&#13;
                part of the ISG community as opposed to being administratively assigned to the&#13;
&#13;
                Region or a Vice Presidential Unit. I see that kind of trend continuing and with&#13;
&#13;
                that going on, there will be less local optimization from a budget standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
                There will be less of â&#128;&#156;I can do it cheaper. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got the staff here. I donâ&#128;&#153;t need&#13;
&#13;
                the central support.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Now as I think, as George says, that there is very much a growing perception&#13;
&#13;
                that thereâ&#128;&#153;s no comparative advantage in local units doing this and that itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 174&#13;
&amp;#12;                duplicative. And particularly now that the Master Service Level Agreement is&#13;
&#13;
                in place, there is less room for gaming the system. We just agree to spend X&#13;
&#13;
                number of dollars in order to provide a certain level of service. We need to have&#13;
&#13;
                the argument at the beginning of the year as to where weâ&#128;&#153;re going to set that&#13;
&#13;
                level of service because that has a material effect on costs and it is a corporate&#13;
&#13;
                decision informed by staff perceptions â&#128;&#147; front-line operating staff perceptions â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                of the effect on marginal investments in better technology on their productivity.&#13;
&#13;
                Once weâ&#128;&#153;ve decided on that, the cost is pretty much fixed for the year unless&#13;
&#13;
                thereâ&#128;&#153;s a significant increase in the number of staff. So, letâ&#128;&#153;s donâ&#128;&#153;t argue about&#13;
&#13;
                it; letâ&#128;&#153;s just set that money aside and agree what kind level of service weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                going to provide. Now in order to do that you have to be clear about is that over&#13;
&#13;
                a long period of time there has not been a huge amount of trust in the central&#13;
&#13;
                organizationâ&#128;&#153;s ability to do this cost-effectively. Thus it is a reasonable question&#13;
&#13;
                for our clients to ask: â&#128;&#156;How can we be sure that this amount of money that ISG&#13;
&#13;
                says is necessary in order to deliver â&#128;&#147; 9,000 units, or whatever the number is â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                how can we be sure that thatâ&#128;&#153;s a reasonable amount of money? How can we be&#13;
&#13;
                sure that youâ&#128;&#153;re not asking for 20% more money than another organization&#13;
&#13;
                would require in order to do the same work?â&#128;? Although we would love it if we&#13;
&#13;
                were so highly regarded and so well loved that everybody would just take our&#13;
&#13;
                word for it, we understand thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the case! And so, one of the things that has&#13;
&#13;
                to happen is a benchmark exercise, a comparison exercise, market-based, so that&#13;
&#13;
                senior managers in particular can have confidence that the Bank is getting a&#13;
&#13;
                level of service for the amount of money it spends comparable to what could be&#13;
&#13;
                gotten outside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                175&#13;
&amp;#12;                This obviously leads to the whole question of outsourcing. IT organizations in&#13;
&#13;
                general have kind of a knee-jerk reaction anytime anyone talks about&#13;
&#13;
                outsourcing. But I would say that at least at the management level in ISG we&#13;
&#13;
                are not afraid of outsourcing. It would be hard for the Bank in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
                personnel difficulties if we did that, but we have consistently tried to tap into the&#13;
&#13;
                market and find â&#128;&#147; weâ&#128;&#153;ve asked over and over again for organizations to come in&#13;
&#13;
                here and give us a cost for what it would be for them to do to take this over.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Say that again â&#128;&#147; what kind of services are you talking about? Basic Services?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Basic Services, along with infrastructure services.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       We want to be sure that if there is somebody outside the Bank who can do this&#13;
&#13;
                for less money than the Bank, for a comparable level of service, or can deliver a&#13;
&#13;
                higher level of service for the same amount of money, we want to know! The&#13;
&#13;
                result of knowing that was true would be either we would choose to outsource&#13;
&#13;
                the service or alternatively, we would know we had to do a better job! It would&#13;
&#13;
                be a senior management decision whether or not to outsource it. In fact, we&#13;
&#13;
                have also put on the table from time to time that our willingness to go forward&#13;
&#13;
                with outsourcing but that according to what we have been able to determine in&#13;
&#13;
                the marketplace, it will be at higher cost. At this moment the institution cannot&#13;
&#13;
                get â&#128;&#147; weâ&#128;&#153;re confident that the institution cannot get â&#128;&#147; the services that are being&#13;
&#13;
                delivered today at a lower cost than we are delivering them. The principal&#13;
&#13;
                reasons are: we donâ&#128;&#153;t pay taxes; we donâ&#128;&#153;t have to make a profit. An outside&#13;
&#13;
                organization probably has to pay more for facilities and square feet and all of&#13;
&#13;
                that kind of stuff. So, you take all of those things into account if we canâ&#128;&#153;t beat&#13;
&#13;
                the outside market we really ought to be out of business. But the fact is we can.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 176&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       Let me add onto that. Looking at outsourcing has been a constant activity for&#13;
&#13;
                probably the last ten years at least. In fact, I was associated with the first kind of&#13;
&#13;
                benchmarking exercise that brought in an external firm to compare the data&#13;
&#13;
                center and operations. We brought in an external outfit to look at the IBM and&#13;
&#13;
                DEC operations ...&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think we were doing benchmarking back in the mid-to-late â&#128;&#153;80s ...&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Thatâ&#128;&#153;s correct. This was done by IAD (Internal Auditing Department) as an&#13;
&#13;
                outside independent body.          They did a comparison that looked at the ISG&#13;
&#13;
                pricing, looked at the cost and did a comparison of the internal service&#13;
&#13;
                costs/prices with external providers. Basically what has happened over time is,&#13;
&#13;
                as the technology services have become commodity services, we have&#13;
&#13;
                contracted out for those and not used internal staff. In fact, I donâ&#128;&#153;t recall what&#13;
&#13;
                the percentages are but the first IT service that was outsourced was the Telex&#13;
&#13;
                and Fax operations.       Now the Bank does have a number of contractual&#13;
&#13;
                outsourced arrangements, such as the security services, food services and things&#13;
&#13;
                of that nature.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Travel services.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Travel services. We have tended to evaluate the provisioning of technology&#13;
&#13;
                services on an ongoing basis and where internal analysis has said that we can get&#13;
&#13;
                this done through a contractual arrangement at a lower-cost and with the same-&#13;
&#13;
                quality. We moved in that direction. All of the break/fix operation is contracted&#13;
&#13;
                out. The pulling of wires and cables is contracted out. Some of the staff in our&#13;
&#13;
                Network Operation Centers are contract staff. All of the computer operators are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  177&#13;
&amp;#12;                contract staff. The Help Desk is contracted out. So, contracting and outsourcing&#13;
&#13;
                has been an ongoing operation.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       So, 35-40% of the staff here that is being used to provide basic services is&#13;
&#13;
                already contracted out.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      35%?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       35-40%, somewhere in that range, and this continues. I think of everything in&#13;
&#13;
                terms of stacks. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a character defect. But the lowest levels of the stack are&#13;
&#13;
                always being commoditized. They are more mature, better understood. People&#13;
&#13;
                know how to do them. So we keep chipping away at the bottom, which means&#13;
&#13;
                the level at which we contract out keeps rising.          At the very top are the&#13;
&#13;
                functionality increases going on and raising the level. So there is this moving&#13;
&#13;
                window. Itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting that the net area continues to increase. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not that we&#13;
&#13;
                are out of the business of delivering the services on the bottom. We still have to&#13;
&#13;
                deliver cable and telex. We still have to operate the computers. We still have to&#13;
&#13;
                pull low voltage wiring and wire the outlets in the building and all of that kind&#13;
&#13;
                of stuff. We used to pay Bank staff to do this, but now we contract this all out.&#13;
&#13;
                It still has to be done and it still has to be paid. Instead, the Bank staff are doing&#13;
&#13;
                the things at the top. And the things at the top continue to get higher. But we&#13;
&#13;
                tend to do more things.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Higher in the sense of more technical? They require better-trained people?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, thereâ&#128;&#153;s an aspect here. I think a portion of the top is also applying the&#13;
&#13;
                technology in the Bank context of knowing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business and knowing&#13;
&#13;
                the technology and making that marriage as to the effective use of technology in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  178&#13;
&amp;#12;                the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s operating environment. I think that is an area where an outside&#13;
&#13;
                contractor does not have any comparative advantage.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Also that when I say â&#128;&#156;topâ&#128;? Iâ&#128;&#153;m thinking that youâ&#128;&#153;re right, thereâ&#128;&#153;s something&#13;
&#13;
                about technological sophistication but there is also something about closeness to&#13;
&#13;
                the business. Ten years ago we had no web pages. Now we have lots of people&#13;
&#13;
                building and delivering information through the web. This is a whole new field.&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s a whole new set of understanding and, yes, there were people outside the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank and inside the Bank who know how to do this. Such people are in short&#13;
&#13;
                supply and command a lot of money. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no reason to think that the Bank is&#13;
&#13;
                better at it than other people, although by and large we do have quite good&#13;
&#13;
                people. But since weâ&#128;&#153;re competing in the same pool, thereâ&#128;&#153;s no reason to think&#13;
&#13;
                that somebody from the outside can hire people less expensively than we can&#13;
&#13;
                hire them. So thereâ&#128;&#153;s no real advantage for us. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no commoditization of&#13;
&#13;
                that.   The spectrum between these things is constantly moving and weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                constantly exploring how to outsource more things. So far, our approach: has&#13;
&#13;
                been to try to chip away at the bottom as opposed to trying to outsource the&#13;
&#13;
                whole lot. As you know there are organizations in the world that have done that,&#13;
&#13;
                particularly in the â&#128;&#153;90s when there was the perception that this was a very cost-&#13;
&#13;
                effective thing to do. So we were constantly looking at it, wanting to be ready to&#13;
&#13;
                answer the question. Wanting to be ahead of the question in fact. Able to say,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Hereâ&#128;&#153;s the analysis that weâ&#128;&#153;ve done.â&#128;? All comes back to the question of, â&#128;&#156;How&#13;
&#13;
                do you satisfy senior management?â&#128;? At the beginning of the year when you say,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;This is how much it costs to do thisâ&#128;?, how do you arrange for senior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              179&#13;
&amp;#12;                management to have a level of comfort that the Bank is getting its moneyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                worth? That the Bank is making prudent use of its resources?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Moving onto SAP. In early 1998 SAP was selected as the vendor to replace&#13;
&#13;
                over 60 fragmented information and business systems. We would like for you&#13;
&#13;
                both to discuss how this came about.          What are the advantages and&#13;
&#13;
                disadvantages of such a system, and what impact did this have on the way ISG&#13;
&#13;
                activities are managed delivered?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me start. Earlier we had talked about a number of base-level studies done.&#13;
&#13;
                There was the Ernst &amp; Young study and even the cost-effectiveness review. The&#13;
&#13;
                Bank had been a developer of its own internal systems and had built custom&#13;
&#13;
                developed systems to meet its own internal processes. Basically the studies&#13;
&#13;
                concluded it was better to buy a system â&#128;&#147; which was the kind of common&#13;
&#13;
                knowledge that existed in the outside world and what the consultants were&#13;
&#13;
                saying as well. Better to buy than to build. This message kept coming across in&#13;
&#13;
                multiple ways.     Some of the existing problems documented in a Harvard&#13;
&#13;
                Business School case study were that when you had the stovepipe systems,&#13;
&#13;
                custom-built systems, the answers that you got to the same questions wound up&#13;
&#13;
                being slightly different. The cost was confusion and embarrassment because&#13;
&#13;
                some of this information went to the Board and things of that nature. The case&#13;
&#13;
                was being built for buying a system to integrate many of the stovepipe&#13;
&#13;
                applications and to use or recognize standard business practices in the external&#13;
&#13;
                world.    A preliminary part of this was done with the implementation of&#13;
&#13;
                PeopleSoft. in the Human Resources area, where the home grown multiple&#13;
&#13;
                systems were replaced with PeopleSoft. That was a precursor. In fact, the time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            180&#13;
&amp;#12;                came when PeopleSoft was considered to be an enterprise resource planning tool&#13;
&#13;
                and ERP system. When the decision was made to consolidate 65 systems and&#13;
&#13;
                100 databases, some people said, â&#128;&#156;Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s a no-brainer. PeopleSoft, youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                got PeopleSoft and you just kind of continue that.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                Well, that was not done. A detailed analysis was done bringing together all&#13;
&#13;
                elements of what would be consolidated from a business standpoint. Then there&#13;
&#13;
                was an evaluation and a Request for Proposals from qualified firms. Now a lot&#13;
&#13;
                of homework was done in terms of preparation for this activity. A standard&#13;
&#13;
                Bank evaluation was done of both the technical factors and proposals from&#13;
&#13;
                multiple vendors. I canâ&#128;&#153;t recall, I think there was SAP â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Oracle, PeopleSoft, these were the three main ones.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, these are the three main ERPs analyzed. This was a&#13;
&#13;
                consolidation to bring together a lot of the business units. This was a part of, I&#13;
&#13;
                would say, an integration effort. Even though it was initiated within ISG, this&#13;
&#13;
                was also a part of the Strategic Compact, with institutional funding. There was a&#13;
&#13;
                heavy corporate aspect to this; it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t just an ISG kind of effort, although I&#13;
&#13;
                think we were certainly the catalyst in bringing the organization to this.&#13;
&#13;
                Business people were involved in the analysis and not just technical people.&#13;
&#13;
                What came out of that was the selection of SAP. It shocked some people that&#13;
&#13;
                this was the choice. Now I may be wrong on this â&#128;&#147; and this was done on a&#13;
&#13;
                technical basis â&#128;&#147; but one of the stories that goes with this was, â&#128;&#156;The Bank has&#13;
&#13;
                always been very good at modifying systems to meet its own unique business&#13;
&#13;
                needs. SAP allows you the ability to bend their system a little bit. But you bend&#13;
&#13;
                it too far and the cost goes way up, so that youâ&#128;&#153;re back into what is effectively a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               181&#13;
&amp;#12;                custom-developed system.â&#128;? The desire to implement what were considered&#13;
&#13;
                well-defined, known, proven business processes came with the SAP modules.&#13;
&#13;
                SAP was a bit more rigid than the other systems, which is not to say that was the&#13;
&#13;
                reason for selection. But it fit in with the goal that if weâ&#128;&#153;re going to standardize,&#13;
&#13;
                letâ&#128;&#153;s standardize and select from the proven business models within SAP that&#13;
&#13;
                most meet our needs. Now that gets us to the point of SAP.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And, what are the advantages and disadvantages of such a system?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure Iâ&#128;&#153;m going to cover all these and Dee, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure, will add much more&#13;
&#13;
                to it. The basic advantage was the attempt to realize how to have consistent&#13;
&#13;
                information accessible to all parties and integrated across the board. Now the&#13;
&#13;
                integration of this information previously was quite literally a nightmare. This&#13;
&#13;
                was spaghetti interfaces, system-to-system, file transfers; all of this was a very&#13;
&#13;
                complex operation and had different timings so you got different answers. The&#13;
&#13;
                advantage was SAP brought the information together â&#128;&#147; it brought the&#13;
&#13;
                organization together â&#128;&#147; from an information standpoint. And that was the major,&#13;
&#13;
                major advantage.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      It must have had some disadvantages that came along with it?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, the disadvantages are that this is a massive change. There were something&#13;
&#13;
                like 90 business process changes that were included. The training effort was&#13;
&#13;
                extremely intensive. The number of changes and the extent of the changes were&#13;
&#13;
                such that this was something that had to be done as a kind of a jump-off-the-cliff&#13;
&#13;
                exercise. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t parallel this system with the old system and run both in&#13;
&#13;
                parallel and transition. It was a kind of a â&#128;&#156;you bet the firm on thisâ&#128;? situation.&#13;
&#13;
                The best way to do that was to implement it at the start of the fiscal year. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 182&#13;
&amp;#12;                disadvantage of doing that was we conducted a massive training exercise during&#13;
&#13;
                the last quarter, the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, cut over on July&#13;
&#13;
                1st and then people go on vacation.       We now have a major change being&#13;
&#13;
                implemented worldwide where a lot of people trained have gone off on home&#13;
&#13;
                leave and wonâ&#128;&#153;t come back to implement their training until September.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      What impact did the implementation of SAP have on the way ISG activities&#13;
&#13;
                were managed and delivered, or, are managed and delivered?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Before we go on I want to make a couple of points related to your initial&#13;
&#13;
                questions. One, I would like to emphasize as much as we can the term â&#128;&#156;Systems&#13;
&#13;
                Renewalâ&#128;? as opposed to the tool, SAP. Itâ&#128;&#153;s, I think, become unfortunate in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank that we focus so much on what tool we chose. Second, I want to connect&#13;
&#13;
                this discussion with the last discussion about consistently contracting out the&#13;
&#13;
                bottom layers as they become mature. I think whatâ&#128;&#153;s actually happening here is&#13;
&#13;
                that building of administrative systems is a mature business and that there are&#13;
&#13;
                people out there who have made a living out of doing it very well, SAP, Oracle,&#13;
&#13;
                BondBahn â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       PeopleSoft, too.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s no longer sensible for an organization like the Bank to go off and hand&#13;
&#13;
                hammer its own systems. There are people who can do it much better and in&#13;
&#13;
                effect what has happened here is weâ&#128;&#153;ve contracted out the building and&#13;
&#13;
                maintenance of these systems to SAP.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     But itâ&#128;&#153;s a very high-end activity.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, recall that what we consider high-end keeps moving up the stack, right?&#13;
&#13;
                Years ago, when we started to contract out low-voltage wiring, we thought that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                183&#13;
&amp;#12;                building the accounting system was a very high-end activity. Now we say to&#13;
&#13;
                ourselves, â&#128;&#156;Well, how difficult is it?      Everybody has a general ledger.&#13;
&#13;
                Everybody has spreadsheets. Everybody has transactions.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Accounts payable, accounts receivable.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, this is not that high-end, right? We used to think that our personnel and&#13;
&#13;
                payroll system had to be hand-crafted because we have these people from all&#13;
&#13;
                over the world and we have to pay them in multiple currencies and we have&#13;
&#13;
                different kinds of tax arrangements and yet after all you have a salary, you have&#13;
&#13;
                so much time worked and you have some deductions, you know?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The other side of this is that the external environment has changed. You have&#13;
&#13;
                multi-national corporations who operate in multiple countries and deal in&#13;
&#13;
                multiple currencies and these ERP systems know how to do that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       All right now, a third thing was finally the great recognition by the Bank that&#13;
&#13;
                there is a very high cost to being different. How much does it cost us to be&#13;
&#13;
                different from the rest of the world? And do we really need to be different from&#13;
&#13;
                the rest of the world? If the Fortune 500 companies can do business in this way,&#13;
&#13;
                then why canâ&#128;&#153;t the Bank? Should we really pay a lot of money to be different?&#13;
&#13;
                And if we can get senior managers or even mid-level mangers to understand the&#13;
&#13;
                cost associated with doing things in a unique World Bank way then perhaps we&#13;
&#13;
                can make effective decisions about whether or not we should do that. A system&#13;
&#13;
                like SAP or any of the others really does help you to focus on why the business&#13;
&#13;
                processes of the Bank do or do not need to be different than anyone elseâ&#128;&#153;s. It&#13;
&#13;
                may be that we can change the way we do in order to save a huge amount of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             184&#13;
&amp;#12;                money and redeploy that money into fighting poverty instead of doing general&#13;
&#13;
                ledgers different than anybody else in the world.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Let me add on this point here. There was a message here conveyed to the&#13;
&#13;
                organization, largely by Dr. Michael Hammer, whom we brought in, that I think&#13;
&#13;
                was essential and I also think itâ&#128;&#153;s a message that needed to be repeated multiple&#13;
&#13;
                times. That message was that Systems Renewal, SAP, whatever you wanted to&#13;
&#13;
                call it, whatever label you put on it, was not a technology project. This was not&#13;
&#13;
                the implementation of an integrated computer system. It was about transforming&#13;
&#13;
                an organization, changing our business processes, establishing a base from&#13;
&#13;
                which we can make further changes. The technology is required but technology&#13;
&#13;
                is not the essence and core of what Systems Renewal was all about and what&#13;
&#13;
                implementing SAP was all about. And this, I think, is what Deeâ&#128;&#153;s point is.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Can we say that it was actually managing information?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No. I think we should use the word â&#128;&#156;systemsâ&#128;? and we should think about&#13;
&#13;
                systems not in terms of computers but in terms of people and business process.&#13;
&#13;
                The machines are there in order to help automate, speed-up and grease the&#13;
&#13;
                wheels of people systems. We recognized our people systems were fouled up,&#13;
&#13;
                that we needed to change the way the people systems worked, the way we&#13;
&#13;
                worked. The key was to change the systemic flow of things, the way business&#13;
&#13;
                was done. In addition, we could have better computer systems to assist us. But&#13;
&#13;
                itâ&#128;&#153;s the change of the business process, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the key thing.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This may be slightly far-fetched but one way of looking at organizations is as&#13;
&#13;
                networks of conversations. And I think that Systems Renewal and changing the&#13;
&#13;
                business processes and making these more consistent, easier to follow, more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             185&#13;
&amp;#12;                      accessible was a means of attempting to change some of the conversations, the&#13;
&#13;
                      networks of conversations that represent how the Bank actually works.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:             I come to my fourth point very much along the lines which George has said. In&#13;
&#13;
                      the late â&#128;&#153;90s.   Many organizations went through various kinds of business&#13;
&#13;
                      process reengineering exercises, despite the fact that re-engineering came to&#13;
&#13;
                      have this overtone as an excuse for massive downsizing. There was, at the core&#13;
&#13;
                      of this, some really legitimate requirements to change the way the organizations&#13;
&#13;
                      did business and focus on the process. The Bank had attempted to do this in the&#13;
&#13;
                      mid-â&#128;&#153;90s. Although it had the indispensable support of senior managers, that&#13;
&#13;
                      process did not go the way we wanted it to go. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s really curious about this&#13;
&#13;
                      change is that all the literature tells you that this kind of a change canâ&#128;&#153;t be done&#13;
&#13;
                      in the computer department. It has to be brought about by line managers. It is&#13;
&#13;
                      an enormous testimony to Mohamed Muhsinâ&#128;&#153;s gift that he was able to transform&#13;
&#13;
                      this into a corporate-wide initiative, with sponsorship from a number of Vice&#13;
&#13;
                      Presidents who came to own it as the business sponsors.&#13;
&#13;
                      There was a transformational period sometime in 1999 when I remember there&#13;
&#13;
                      was a meeting of some of the business sponsors and they forgot to invite ISG.&#13;
&#13;
                      When that happened, youâ&#128;&#153;d think that we would be unhappy, but we were not.&#13;
&#13;
                      We were thrilled because that meant they owned it! This had changed from&#13;
&#13;
                      being a computer thing to being a business process thing. After all is said and&#13;
&#13;
                      done, there are many people who will complain bitterly about the SAP&#13;
&#13;
                      implementation â&#128;&#147; thatâ&#128;&#153;s what they called it â&#128;&#147; about Systems Renewal. But itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                      that which, in the long run, will prove that this has been successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                186&#13;
&amp;#12;                I want to say a word or two about success and what went wrong. George said&#13;
&#13;
                earlier and I totally agree that you have to pick the metric you use to measure&#13;
&#13;
                success. For me, the measure of success here will be when senior managers can&#13;
&#13;
                come together in the same room with information provided by their staff about&#13;
&#13;
                the state of play in the Bank and agree on what the numbers are. That there is&#13;
&#13;
                not an entirely different set of analysis going on based on different numbers.&#13;
&#13;
                Instead, there is one consistent set of corporate data out of which everything is&#13;
&#13;
                drawn.    That is the single success of SAP, the single success of Systems&#13;
&#13;
                Renewal. Longer term, we will get all of the user interface issues straightened&#13;
&#13;
                out. We did have some problems because we made one or two pretty bad&#13;
&#13;
                choices. I think that the desire for the business process change to insist upon&#13;
&#13;
                staff members doing their own data entry was the right choice. But coupling&#13;
&#13;
                that with the desire that they use the system provided by SAP with its interface&#13;
&#13;
                in order to do the data entry was, I think, a mistake. In retrospect, I think we&#13;
&#13;
                should have taken the time to build some user-friendly front end to the things&#13;
&#13;
                that front line staff had to use. Because, after all, effectively the Travel system&#13;
&#13;
                was the only [SAP module that most staff used]. Now thatâ&#128;&#153;s been done. A&#13;
&#13;
                second thing that went wrong was not, I think, so much a mistake as it was a&#13;
&#13;
                property of the necessary transition we had to go through in order to get this to&#13;
&#13;
                be a corporately owned â&#128;&#147; instead of an IT-owned â&#128;&#147; initiative. In the early stages&#13;
&#13;
                in 1998 when we were doing blueprinting and trying to figure out what the new&#13;
&#13;
                processes would be, this was still from the perspective of people in the front&#13;
&#13;
                line; this was still low-grade noise coming out of the back room guys doing IT&#13;
&#13;
                stuff. We couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get people to pay attention to the blueprinting exercise when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               187&#13;
&amp;#12;                it was going on. Blueprinting is that part of the process in which the business&#13;
&#13;
                staff has to come together with the IT folk and figure out how the process ought&#13;
&#13;
                to work. What exactly is it that weâ&#128;&#153;re doing today? And how do we need to&#13;
&#13;
                change that in order to have a smooth flow of process?&#13;
&#13;
                Because we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get people to focus on things during the blueprinting stage,&#13;
&#13;
                the whole project slipped. By the time people began to pay attention, we were&#13;
&#13;
                well into implementation and system test. People were saying, â&#128;&#156;No, no, we&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t want it to work that way, Oh no, we have to figure out how to do this&#13;
&#13;
                differently!â&#128;? So theyâ&#128;&#153;re back in the back trying to hammer this together, trying&#13;
&#13;
                to make it be what they want it to be at the last minute. The deadline for cutover&#13;
&#13;
                couldnâ&#128;&#153;t shift. What happened was that the schedule got compressed at the end&#13;
&#13;
                and all of the training had to be done in the last couple of months. Training and&#13;
&#13;
                documentation which had been scheduled to be a much longer process bore the&#13;
&#13;
                brunt of the compression in the schedule that occurred because the business staff&#13;
&#13;
                were not able or willing to pay the attention at that time. I think that is endemic&#13;
&#13;
                to this kind of process. People donâ&#128;&#153;t pay attention until they have to or until itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                too late. A lot of things went wrong because they had this fixed and immutable&#13;
&#13;
                deadline for cutover. Partly derived from the Y2K, partly self-imposed, partly&#13;
&#13;
                as George said, because it was an important point in the business cycle. The&#13;
&#13;
                result was we paid such short shrift to the training and gave individual staff&#13;
&#13;
                members an interface that was very difficult to use. The third thing I think went&#13;
&#13;
                wrong, again something that we knew that would be likely to go wrong and&#13;
&#13;
                Michael Hammer had said would go wrong, is that nothing shines a bright light&#13;
&#13;
                on bad process like an ERP implementation. We had a lot of bad data and a lot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                188&#13;
&amp;#12;                of bad process that we were making up for with human intervention. The&#13;
&#13;
                minute you automate all that and ask a computer to do it, suddenly you realize&#13;
&#13;
                all the bad things that have been going on. We had a couple of examples in our&#13;
&#13;
                accounts payable process.          We had people who had been doing accounts&#13;
&#13;
                payable for 20 years who had all kinds of knowledge in their head and all kinds&#13;
&#13;
                of little 3x5 cards in their desk drawer, which were used to make up for the fact&#13;
&#13;
                that we had bad data and bad process for the hiring and retention of contractual&#13;
&#13;
                services, consultants and contractors. The accounting people knew where to&#13;
&#13;
                send the check. They knew the addresses we had in the databases were wrong.&#13;
&#13;
                They knew that this guy was really working for that company. They were&#13;
&#13;
                making up for the bad data. The minute we cut all that over to SAP, we had a&#13;
&#13;
                scandal in The Washington Post because we werenâ&#128;&#153;t paying our consultants and&#13;
&#13;
                our contractors, because the process was bad â&#128;&#147; or put another way: we had an&#13;
&#13;
                inefficient people-intensive system to make up for bad process and bad data, but&#13;
&#13;
                the minute we automated, those faults came to the surface.&#13;
&#13;
                Another example of this was the whole business of Trust Funds. We all knew,&#13;
&#13;
                or a lot of people knew, that there were rules associated with individual Trust&#13;
&#13;
                Funds about what kinds of charges could be made against those resources. And&#13;
&#13;
                yet there was no mechanism in place to enforce any of that so people played a&#13;
&#13;
                little loose with the rules. All of a sudden we have systems that are going to&#13;
&#13;
                enforce a set of rules that people have been unaccustomed to having to live with.&#13;
&#13;
                Suddenly after we go live on the system, there were three or four people that had&#13;
&#13;
                to travel, they had to get this done. So people posted transactions anywhere they&#13;
&#13;
                could get them to stick. They had to get a payment. People would do these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             189&#13;
&amp;#12;                transactions and they had a brand new system and they didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand it. It&#13;
&#13;
                had a bad interface or at least a steep learning curve. We had a whole lot of&#13;
&#13;
                transactions that were misplaced and had to be re-posted at mid-year.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The typical example was you had Trust Funds funding but you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t use that&#13;
&#13;
                funding and therefore you charge that expense to the administrative budget with&#13;
&#13;
                the intention of straightening it out later. Well, this created problems. The focus&#13;
&#13;
                on the data was extreme here because the system really put the spotlight on it&#13;
&#13;
                and it became very obvious. As Dee said the non-payment of vendors was from&#13;
&#13;
                address files not being correct. This was a case where people were prepared to&#13;
&#13;
                live with it for a little bit but when theyâ&#128;&#153;re not paid for an extended period, they&#13;
&#13;
                complain. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what got to the press.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I guess thereâ&#128;&#153;s a risk here. Iâ&#128;&#153;m trying to think in terms of somebody reading this&#13;
&#13;
                five years from now. I know that thereâ&#128;&#153;s been criticism inside the Bank that we,&#13;
&#13;
                in ISG, are portraying this as a great success even though other people felt that it&#13;
&#13;
                was very painful and not a success. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to be saying that we didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                have any problems with the systems. We did have problems. A system change&#13;
&#13;
                of this magnitude will always uncover difficulties and yet the number of actual&#13;
&#13;
                system problems, I think, was remarkably low and the stability and the service&#13;
&#13;
                levels of this SAP system were everything we had hoped for. It was rock solid.&#13;
&#13;
                We have not had failures of the infrastructure; we have not had failures of the&#13;
&#13;
                system. We have had some bugs, we did have some bugs, but the number of&#13;
&#13;
                bugs in the implementation was, I think, remarkably low.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     What other organizations use the SAP system? What has been the history of the&#13;
&#13;
                system before it came to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                190&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       SAP is used by thousands of organizations. It is dominant.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       SAP at the time was the largest ERP in the world.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     It is German?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       German, yes. But for, I would say, seven or eight years, itâ&#128;&#153;s been really a&#13;
&#13;
                dominant player in this field. I would say that the three biggest players in this&#13;
&#13;
                are SAP, which has its roots in the manufacturing area, Oracle, whose roots are&#13;
&#13;
                in the financial side and PeopleSoft, which has roots in the HR side.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I wanted to go back and emphasize one of the points that Dee mentioned here.&#13;
&#13;
                The problems associated with SAP were mainly on the user use of the system. I&#13;
&#13;
                can recall that previously â&#128;&#147; and this was endemic â&#128;&#147; when custom-developed&#13;
&#13;
                systems had been implemented in the Bank, especially on mainframes, we ran&#13;
&#13;
                into capacity issues, we ran into response time issues. We either had to upgrade&#13;
&#13;
                the mainframe or the server associated with the application. There was always a&#13;
&#13;
                mismatch of some sort between the workload generated by the new system and&#13;
&#13;
                the infrastructure that supported it.   What we wound up doing was tuning the&#13;
&#13;
                application and modifying the infrastructure hardware support. That did not&#13;
&#13;
                happen with the SAP implementation. The other thing that needs to be looked at&#13;
&#13;
                here â&#128;&#147; and this is a portion of the assessment of success â&#128;&#147; is that this was a&#13;
&#13;
                worldwide implementation of a centralized system. That was 70-plus locations&#13;
&#13;
                worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Eighty?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure of the exact number of the time of implementation. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure itâ&#128;&#153;s 80&#13;
&#13;
                now. A worldwide implementation that actually worked. Dee is right; there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             191&#13;
&amp;#12;                were problems, but the Bank continued to function. There were some hiccups in&#13;
&#13;
                there but the Bank continued to work with this system.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       One of the great stories that occurred during this time derives from when&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed formed a group of external CIOs and VPs and whatnot from outside&#13;
&#13;
                organizations which had been through this or who understood about ERP&#13;
&#13;
                implementations to advise him. He would bring them in from time to time and&#13;
&#13;
                have a little conversation about where we were and what was going on and they&#13;
&#13;
                would try to help him to prepare for the kinds of bumps that we might run into.&#13;
&#13;
                At one point he was asking people in the room what they thought the likelihood&#13;
&#13;
                was of our being able to do this.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Pull this off.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       To pull this off without difficulty and one of the people who I believe was a very&#13;
&#13;
                senior person, maybe it was IBM, Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure who this person was with, but he&#13;
&#13;
                said,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Tell me again how many modules of SAP youâ&#128;&#153;re doing?â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Seven.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;And youâ&#128;&#153;re trying to do this worldwide? In 70 locations? In developing&#13;
&#13;
                countries?â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Yes,â&#128;? Mohamed said.&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Well, OK, in that case, I would say that the likelihood of youâ&#128;&#153;re being able to&#13;
&#13;
                pull this off is zero,â&#128;? the guy replied. â&#128;&#156;There is no possibility of your doing&#13;
&#13;
                this,â&#128;? he said. And we proved him wrong! But I am sure that Mohamed had&#13;
&#13;
                some sleepless nights. This was a guy who really understood this stuff and he&#13;
&#13;
                said, â&#128;&#156;This is the most complicated implementation of SAP Iâ&#128;&#153;ve ever heard of.&#13;
&#13;
                Nobody will succeed at doing something like this without trouble.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              192&#13;
&amp;#12;                Of course, we knew of organizations that had tried to implement SAP and had&#13;
&#13;
                had to pull it out like Dell, for example. They had tried to implement SAP on a&#13;
&#13;
                large scale but not a worldwide scale. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve been in here and talked to us&#13;
&#13;
                about their difficulties with it. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re not using SAP as we thought.&#13;
&#13;
                I want to say one more thing. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve made a list of points. I have one more point&#13;
&#13;
                and that is I want to echo â&#128;&#147; I think George already said this â&#128;&#147; I want to echo how&#13;
&#13;
                proud I was of the conduct of the selection process for this package. I was not&#13;
&#13;
                involved in it. I had nothing whatever to do with it so I can be as proud as I&#13;
&#13;
                want. As George said, we went into this [RFP evaluation], we had a body of&#13;
&#13;
                expertise on PeopleSoft; PeopleSoft was one of the candidate systems. And we&#13;
&#13;
                went into this [evaluation] and I was one of the people who thought, â&#128;&#156;Boy, this&#13;
&#13;
                is a waste of time, you know, weâ&#128;&#153;re going to end up going with PeopleSoft&#13;
&#13;
                because we have this expertise; we know how it works. We already have an&#13;
&#13;
                implementation. Itâ&#128;&#153;s silly for us to look at something else, you know because&#13;
&#13;
                the costs are going to be higher.â&#128;? And yet, a group of people went at this with a&#13;
&#13;
                degree of intellectual honesty that I am in awe of. They did, I think, a fabulous&#13;
&#13;
                job of looking at the pros and cons of all of these things. And really being harsh&#13;
&#13;
                and intellectually honest about the trade-offs associated with going to something&#13;
&#13;
                other than PeopleSoft. I know that going into this whole thing I and some other&#13;
&#13;
                people had a kind of an attitude about SAP. I did not want us to go with SAP.&#13;
&#13;
                And more importantly, other people who were much closer to it and who had&#13;
&#13;
                much more to do with it also had this feeling that we didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be with&#13;
&#13;
                SAP. And yet at the end of the day, the [evaluation team] took this intellectually&#13;
&#13;
                honest look and concluded that this was where we needed to be. This was the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              193&#13;
&amp;#12;                most cost-effective decision for the Bank.. I looked at the work done and was&#13;
&#13;
                convinced that they had done something that I have, as I said, a lot of pride in. I&#13;
&#13;
                have a lot of pride in the way the ISG staff involved did this work.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       There were also staff outside of ISG who involved in the evaluation. This&#13;
&#13;
                turned out to be I think a pure intellectual exercise. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s always judgment&#13;
&#13;
                associated with this thing. But they came out with something that was a surprise&#13;
&#13;
                to a lot of people, myself included.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      OK would you like to break now?&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Just one quick question on SAP. In selecting SAP, were there any political&#13;
&#13;
                considerations in that SAP is not an American company?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so at all. I donâ&#128;&#153;t there was a shred of that going on.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I would concur with that as well. I think this was a straight technical cost&#13;
&#13;
                evaluation taking into account capabilities of the packages and our needs as an&#13;
&#13;
                organization.&#13;
&#13;
[End of Side A]&#13;

[Side B Begins Here]&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Moving on to the CDF (Comprehensive Development Framework).                     As&#13;
&#13;
                information technology evolved at the Bank, it moved from being a backroom&#13;
&#13;
                function to information management to building a Knowledge Bank. When the&#13;
&#13;
                CDF was first introduced in January â&#128;&#153;99 it transformed the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s culture and&#13;
&#13;
                its relationship with clients, partners, and stakeholders as its holistic approach&#13;
&#13;
                provided a new set of challenges, increased connectivity and wider access to&#13;
&#13;
                information technologies crucial to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s strategy. Please discuss how the&#13;
&#13;
                ISG team met the challenges of global networking, video conferencing, distance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               194&#13;
&amp;#12;                learning. Today we have about 30 Distance Learning Centers around the world,&#13;
&#13;
                the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s website, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think itâ&#128;&#153;s interesting that you couch this in terms of the CDF. We saw the&#13;
&#13;
                Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s focus on the Comprehensive Development Framework as being yet&#13;
&#13;
                another of his farsighted initiatives which in a way had its root in the capabilities&#13;
&#13;
                provided by a technologically enabled world. You couldnâ&#128;&#153;t begin to think about&#13;
&#13;
                how you would implement a CDF holistic approach among all of the&#13;
&#13;
                stakeholders in a country development environment unless there was a global&#13;
&#13;
                technology for it. But our focus on implementing global networking, video&#13;
&#13;
                conferencing, distance learning, all of these sorts of things were, to me, not&#13;
&#13;
                motivated by the CDF decision. I remember in probably â&#128;&#153;98 we wrote a strategy&#13;
&#13;
                document for Mohamed in which we arrayed a number of institutional corporate&#13;
&#13;
                initiatives in progress against various other technological initiatives underway in&#13;
&#13;
                ISG. We tried to say that these are the things that senior management says are&#13;
&#13;
                important for the Bank to do. Increased partnership, CDF â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think decentralization is also a major â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, decentralization of the Bank. There were a whole array of initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
                Then we looked at the things that were we were doing that were supportive of&#13;
&#13;
                those initiatives.   Of course the Global Network is supportive of almost&#13;
&#13;
                everything that weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to do. So, it isnâ&#128;&#153;t a reaction to CDF. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an&#13;
&#13;
                enabling technology that is required for all of the things that are corporate&#13;
&#13;
                initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      These efforts were spurred on by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 195&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       By the set of strategic objectives that the President set, including CDF.     But&#13;
&#13;
                also, I think, to me, the focus that he has brought to distance learning, for&#13;
&#13;
                example, is almost a different one of his intellectual initiatives than the CDF. I&#13;
&#13;
                believe it even pre-dates the CDF. He was after us to get on with this Global&#13;
&#13;
                Distance Learning, I think even in â&#128;&#153;97. In any case, we had begun the effort to&#13;
&#13;
                extend the Enterprise Network to the global environment as early as â&#128;&#153;95. We&#13;
&#13;
                were beginning to do it in â&#128;&#153;95, â&#128;&#153;96. But it was largely motivated by an ability to&#13;
&#13;
                do the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s internal administrative work better. Maybe this is a good time to&#13;
&#13;
                reinforce this business about the four different kinds of ways that what we do&#13;
&#13;
                helps to enable the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work. There are the services that we provide that&#13;
&#13;
                enable individual staff members to work, to produce documents and to write&#13;
&#13;
                reports and all that sort of stuff. People have to be able to find information.&#13;
&#13;
                Then there is the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s internal business process which the corporate services&#13;
&#13;
                help us to do: the accounting systems, the payroll, the lending process and all of&#13;
&#13;
                that. All of these business processes are supported by technology. Then third,&#13;
&#13;
                there is the conduct of the business with our immediate customers and&#13;
&#13;
                stakeholders that technology enables us to have an interaction with.          The&#13;
&#13;
                technology enables a government to get access to data about its position. It&#13;
&#13;
                enables us to conduct a flow of statistics between the Bank and the government&#13;
&#13;
                that enables us to get the data kept in the economic and social databases. It&#13;
&#13;
                enables the donors to keep track of what kind of resources they are providing&#13;
&#13;
                and where those resources are going. There are all these kinds of interactions&#13;
&#13;
                that are at the boundary between the Bank and the countries, the stakeholders,&#13;
&#13;
                the owners. And then fourth, there is another area, which is the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s role in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              196&#13;
&amp;#12;                helping the countries themselves to adopt technology as a means to&#13;
&#13;
                development: to apply technology to their internal processes to collect taxes or&#13;
&#13;
                do a census or set up customs or education or whatever it is.     We had largely&#13;
&#13;
                been focused on the first two of these or possibly even the first three before Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Wolfensohn came along. Itâ&#128;&#153;s Mr. Wolfensohn who has put so much emphasis&#13;
&#13;
                on the last two and who has recognized that ISG is a weapon he can wield&#13;
&#13;
                through Mohamed to try to attack some of these problems which historically the&#13;
&#13;
                central IS organization had nothing to do with. We were not engaged in any of&#13;
&#13;
                the dialogue about how to promote the information economy in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Wolfensohn's focus on this and his interaction with Mohamed about it&#13;
&#13;
                started in â&#128;&#153;97 and he is trying to enable Mohamed to have dialogue with the&#13;
&#13;
                Regional Vice Presidents about how technology could be brought to bear on&#13;
&#13;
                some of these problems. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been very transformational for us. But I think it&#13;
&#13;
                pre-dates the CDF. Itâ&#128;&#153;s almost as though we have a leader for the first time who&#13;
&#13;
                has this on his radar screen. His interest is not in whether we can do a better job&#13;
&#13;
                of running the general ledger or whether we can keep better track of the budget&#13;
&#13;
                numbers. The President has â&#128;&#147; I wonâ&#128;&#153;t say no interest in that â&#128;&#147; but I think&#13;
&#13;
                appropriately his focus is outward. His dialogue with Mohamed is not about&#13;
&#13;
                these things that weâ&#128;&#153;ve been struggling with for years. Mr. Wolfensohn is five&#13;
&#13;
                years ahead, which meant a bit of a challenge for us. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a challenge in how we&#13;
&#13;
                change our focus. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a challenge in skills for us. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a political challenge&#13;
&#13;
                inside the Bank because there are not really enough resources to do all this&#13;
&#13;
                work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               197&#13;
&amp;#12;                Now the President is perfectly capable of having dreams about things that&#13;
&#13;
                should be done for which there is not an appropriate level of resources.&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed is the kind of guy who when the President says, â&#128;&#156;I want 30 Distance&#13;
&#13;
                Learning Centers up by April,â&#128;? Mohamed salutes and says, â&#128;&#156; Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to go&#13;
&#13;
                try to do it.â&#128;? In this regard I also want to honor Le Vu who is the head of the&#13;
&#13;
                Global Communications organization and ideally suited to work under&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamedâ&#128;&#153;s leadership on this because heâ&#128;&#153;s so much like Mohamed in this&#13;
&#13;
                regard. He just will turn heaven and earth; he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have a nickel to do this&#13;
&#13;
                with but he just goes out there and delivers. They built this Global Network,&#13;
&#13;
                which is the key underpinning to all of that, and they built these Global Distance&#13;
&#13;
                Learning Centers opportunistically. Mr. Wolfensohn visits some country, has a&#13;
&#13;
                dialogue with some leader, and they reach an agreement that, by golly, this&#13;
&#13;
                countryâ&#128;&#153;s going to have a Global Distance Learning Center, He comes back and&#13;
&#13;
                the word percolates down over here that, Le Vu, youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to go build another&#13;
&#13;
                Global Distance Learning Center in this country, for which we have no money&#13;
&#13;
                and we have to go make some arrangements.                Internal administrative&#13;
&#13;
                arrangements for the conduct of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s internal business have not been set&#13;
&#13;
                up with this in mind so they have had to be very imaginative in the ways in&#13;
&#13;
                which they approach this. The countries want us to do this work, to figure out&#13;
&#13;
                what equipment needs to be bought, to purchase it, to deliver it, to work with the&#13;
&#13;
                vendors, and put it all together. But to a large extent thatâ&#128;&#153;s not what the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                does. The Bank has been set up for 50 years to watch over a countryâ&#128;&#153;s shoulder&#13;
&#13;
                and make them do the work. We lend them the money and we review the&#13;
&#13;
                documents, the bidding process and we ensure that it goes â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              198&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      You mean in an advisory capacity?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       In an advisory capacity. Here we are, I think, breaking new ground, which has&#13;
&#13;
                been very difficult. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been very difficult to both deliver on the incredibly&#13;
&#13;
                intense schedule that the President has been setting forth while at the same time&#13;
&#13;
                inventing new business process as we go, working with the Legal Department,&#13;
&#13;
                working with Procurement, working with the Regions on just whatâ&#128;&#153;s an&#13;
&#13;
                appropriate way to do this. Such that the Bank doesnâ&#128;&#153;t step over the line â&#128;&#147; or&#13;
&#13;
                whatever these imaginary lines are â&#128;&#147;about whatâ&#128;&#153;s our role and what the&#13;
&#13;
                governmentâ&#128;&#153;s role is.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Some of this has been necessitated by the fact that the core here is the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                Global Network. This is where standardization comes into play in that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                is actually specifying the equipment.       Since the Global Distance Learning&#13;
&#13;
                Centers are riding on top of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s network, it turns out that itâ&#128;&#153;s easier for us&#13;
&#13;
                to specify the equipment that goes into these centers.         Weâ&#128;&#153;ve actually got&#13;
&#13;
                designs done from scratch for Distance Learning Centers and can incorporate&#13;
&#13;
                the different models available into an existing resident mission or separate site.&#13;
&#13;
                Thatâ&#128;&#153;s where some aspects of difficulties with the countries occur because under&#13;
&#13;
                a standard loan or credit the procurement is done under the international&#13;
&#13;
                competitive bidding rules.         What weâ&#128;&#153;re coming in with is a standard&#13;
&#13;
                configuration of hardware that the Bank installs and that normally the country&#13;
&#13;
                pays for.     Itâ&#128;&#153;s different from the standard lending operation that we're&#13;
&#13;
                accustomed to. And the history of standardization, the expansion of the Global&#13;
&#13;
                Network, the continuing increase in functionality and capabilities here, all work&#13;
&#13;
                to support a vision that says, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re global but weâ&#128;&#153;re integrated.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 199&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Thereâ&#128;&#153;s another aspect of the Global Distance Learning that I feel remiss in not&#13;
&#13;
                having mentioned. We are very much partners in this with WBI (World Bank&#13;
&#13;
                Institute). Iâ&#128;&#153;ve characterized it as if weâ&#128;&#153;re in the driverâ&#128;&#153;s seat and I think we&#13;
&#13;
                would like to portray this as WBIâ&#128;&#153;s being in the driverâ&#128;&#153;s seat and weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                supporting them.. I do think that in the early stages that Mohamed was tapped&#13;
&#13;
                by the President to be very much in a leadership position about this. And I think&#13;
&#13;
                to his credit Mohamed always recognizes that there are a lot of other players&#13;
&#13;
                involved. At the time Vinod Thomas headed WBI and theyâ&#128;&#153;re close working&#13;
&#13;
                colleagues. From the beginning Mohamed has really worked hard to ensure that&#13;
&#13;
                this is first an EDI- [Economic Development Institute, the precusor of WBI],&#13;
&#13;
                then a WBI-led initiative. We also need to recognize that although we in the&#13;
&#13;
                technology department focus a lot on the technology, this can never be&#13;
&#13;
                successful without the sort of the higher-level pedagogical kind of influence that&#13;
&#13;
                WBI brings.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The content.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       And so, Iâ&#128;&#153;m just mindful of the fact that this is going in to some record and I&#13;
&#13;
                would at least like to be accurate that this isnâ&#128;&#153;t entirely an ISG thing.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       In fact, thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing that ISG does that it does for itself. Itâ&#128;&#153;s an organization&#13;
&#13;
                that is an element of a larger organization and weâ&#128;&#153;re here to support the&#13;
&#13;
                business.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     To enable.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       To enable. Now that doesnâ&#128;&#153;t say we donâ&#128;&#153;t have initiatives that we think can&#13;
&#13;
                move the organization forward.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       You also mentioned the websites here. This is another . . .&#13;

&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Proliferation of the websites.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Proliferation, also the growing recognition that this is an important part of what&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank is. And how we appear to the rest of the world. I think probably it&#13;
&#13;
                was during one of the Annual Meetings in 97 when the President, in his address&#13;
&#13;
                said that we were going to increase the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s electronic presence, that we were&#13;
&#13;
                going to change the way the Bank interacted with the world. This was prior to&#13;
&#13;
                CDF and it was the signal to us to put a lot of attention on the external website.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Was it in â&#128;&#153;96 when he talked about building a Knowledge Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Might have been â&#128;&#153;96.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Thatâ&#128;&#153;s when he talked about building a Knowledge Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I was thinking it was â&#128;&#153;97, but it might have been â&#128;&#153;96, because I think that was&#13;
&#13;
                the hallmark for us to â&#128;&#147; we had already started to do a lot work on the internal&#13;
&#13;
                work network.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And he said something to the effect that, â&#128;&#156;If the Bank wasnâ&#128;&#153;t going to change,&#13;
&#13;
                change will be thrust upon it.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think the whole thing about the website, both the external and the internal sites&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#147; and people donâ&#128;&#153;t talk about it in these terms â&#128;&#147; but itâ&#128;&#153;s establishing an&#13;
&#13;
                organizational identity to an electronic community.        People have come to&#13;
&#13;
                understand that you need a website that is â&#128;&#156;seductiveâ&#128;? in getting your message&#13;
&#13;
                across. Itâ&#128;&#153;s both a necessary and additional activity on top of everything else&#13;
&#13;
                you do and have done previously from external affairs relations, press releases,&#13;
&#13;
                all of that kind of thing. Itâ&#128;&#153;s another way to get your message across and&#13;
&#13;
                establish your identity for an external audience and internally as well. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                201&#13;
&amp;#12;                basically some of the rationale for the proliferation. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not in the game if I&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t have a website.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      But how do we mirror whatâ&#128;&#153;s happening worldwide? I mean it is a virtual&#13;
&#13;
                world. And there is such a demand.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       As Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said before, we come to the same set of questions that others come to.&#13;
&#13;
                Sometimes I think that weâ&#128;&#153;ve come to these questions earlier than some others&#13;
&#13;
                and sometimes I think that we agonize about them longer. We maybe take&#13;
&#13;
                longer to come to closure on them. Perhaps because of the kind of debate we&#13;
&#13;
                have in the Bank. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure quite why that is.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Well, your stakeholders are different than in the private sector. You have these&#13;
&#13;
                governments that are in fact the stakeholders whereas in the private sector, itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                not as clear-cut who the stakeholders are. I mean theyâ&#128;&#153;re more amorphous and&#13;
&#13;
                management has more control, I think. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s why thereâ&#128;&#153;d be more debate&#13;
&#13;
                here.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Also, the measures of success are a lot clearer in the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     Right.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Here is another area in which I think ISGâ&#128;&#153;s role has been dicey. We â&#128;&#147; like any&#13;
&#13;
                other organization â&#128;&#147; created an external presence on the Internet from the IT&#13;
&#13;
                organization initially. And like every other organization, it starts off looking&#13;
&#13;
                like something put out by the IT organization and then migrates through a time&#13;
&#13;
                when the external presence is organized along the internal organizational lines&#13;
&#13;
                of the entity.    In a way you can measure the maturity of an organizationâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                Internet presence by the degree to which it presents a unified picture of the&#13;
&#13;
                organization, which does not reflect its internal organizational structure. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             202&#13;
&amp;#12;                ability of an organization to do that is hard won because initially each individual&#13;
&#13;
                part of the organization wants to have its own identity manifest to the outside&#13;
&#13;
                world. We went through that. You know, this organization, that organization,&#13;
&#13;
                the other organization within the Bank wanted to have an external web presence&#13;
&#13;
                and tell their story.    And the first victory you win as an organization is&#13;
&#13;
                recognition that you only want to have one web set site and one brand. Our&#13;
&#13;
                brand is the World Bank. Our brand is not the Environment Department or the&#13;
&#13;
                economists or the Accounting Department. Itâ&#128;&#153;s the World Bank. What you end&#13;
&#13;
                up doing is having a single site but itâ&#128;&#153;s really composed of the individual&#13;
&#13;
                offerings of the organizations. When you make the transition to having a site&#13;
&#13;
                thatâ&#128;&#153;s topical on the kinds of the things oriented to what the audience wants to&#13;
&#13;
                see instead of what the individual organizations want to put out, then I think you&#13;
&#13;
                begin to make this transition to a kind of modern, mature website. And I think&#13;
&#13;
                we did that some time in around â&#128;&#153;98. When they remade the external website,&#13;
&#13;
                Mike Potashnik was recruited from the education sector to take control of the&#13;
&#13;
                external website. He recruited some people who set to work to a large extent&#13;
&#13;
                building consensus, building bridges with the various organizations within the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank. Our early efforts had not been successful. In fact, we went through a&#13;
&#13;
                period of time in which there grew to be a lot of tension between ISG and&#13;
&#13;
                External Affairs. Initially, External Affairs was, very naturally, very consumed&#13;
&#13;
                with the kinds of work that they had always done and they had only a certain&#13;
&#13;
                amount of resources and they had many challenges and problems.           And here&#13;
&#13;
                come the electronic guys, here comes ISG saying, â&#128;&#156;You have a whole new set of&#13;
&#13;
                businesses you have to do. A whole new set of responsibilities.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               203&#13;
&amp;#12;                â&#128;&#156;Well, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have any money and we donâ&#128;&#153;t have any time, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have&#13;
&#13;
                any people to do that. Go away!â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                Of course they were very conflicted about it because at the same time that they&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t really have the resources and whatnot to take this on. It was clear that&#13;
&#13;
                this was very much an important element in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s message. There was a&#13;
&#13;
                period of time in which there was some struggle back and forth and I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                know enough about it to characterize that struggle. But I think there came a&#13;
&#13;
                time and I again have to point to Mohamed and say, â&#128;&#156;Hereâ&#128;&#153;s a guy whoâ&#128;&#153;s always&#13;
&#13;
                looking for a way to be in partnership with somebody else in the driverâ&#128;&#153;s seat.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                He recognized that we really needed to be the junior partner to External Affairs&#13;
&#13;
                in the presentation of the external website. And his recognition of that in an&#13;
&#13;
                early stage and his clamping down on our own people and saying, â&#128;&#156;Look, our&#13;
&#13;
                task is to help them to, first of all embrace this responsibility that they have and&#13;
&#13;
                to take ownership of it and not to be in constant fights with them even if they&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t at the outset totally understand everything that they have to doâ&#128;? enabled&#13;
&#13;
                that transition to get made in â&#128;&#153;98 or so. And I think weâ&#128;&#153;ve done a pretty good&#13;
&#13;
                job of it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       One of the aspects of maintaining an external presence is this is a job requiring&#13;
&#13;
                constant updating. We tend to have not only the addition of ongoing data and&#13;
&#13;
                the updating of information as you go along, but thereâ&#128;&#153;s a big website out there&#13;
&#13;
                in terms of the content now , which also has to be topical and the like. But to&#13;
&#13;
                keep people coming back, normally thereâ&#128;&#153;s a once a year kind of â&#128;&#156;new lookâ&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                associated with the website, which tends to be around Annual Meeting time. So&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                204&#13;
&amp;#12;                itâ&#128;&#153;s a new line of business. Itâ&#128;&#153;s clearly recognized now that External Affairs has&#13;
&#13;
                the responsibility for at least how that identity appears to the external world.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve gone through quite a few people over the course of the last five years&#13;
&#13;
                to try to embrace this responsibility. There are very good people in there.&#13;
&#13;
                Theyâ&#128;&#153;re very focused on it now and very much in charge, so we, again, have got&#13;
&#13;
                ourselves into a supporting role. We have very tight relations with them, but&#13;
&#13;
                they are in the driverâ&#128;&#153;s seat, just as it should be. I think we have a really terrific&#13;
&#13;
                external web presence now. Not that there arenâ&#128;&#153;t many things that we have left&#13;
&#13;
                to do. Some of the challenges that we have to face are the management of the&#13;
&#13;
                delivery of information, which is by nature very dynamic, and constantly&#13;
&#13;
                changing. Through a static â&#128;&#147; I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to use the word portal because it has a&#13;
&#13;
                different meaning â&#128;&#147; but through a static window and with the ability to manage&#13;
&#13;
                this dynamic information. Keep track of everything to enable all the different&#13;
&#13;
                parts of the organization that have a role in portraying information to make it&#13;
&#13;
                possible for them to update their information. A lot of work is going on in that&#13;
&#13;
                way and a lot of it coming from ISG. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s also the recognition of the need&#13;
&#13;
                for commonality of information between the internal delivery of information and&#13;
&#13;
                the external delivery of information. We began thinking that there was a body&#13;
&#13;
                of information that was outside and a body of information that was inside.&#13;
&#13;
                Sometime in the late â&#128;&#153;90s we realized that really is the wrong way to look at it.&#13;
&#13;
                We needed to look at it as whether this piece of information should be reflected&#13;
&#13;
                on the outside, on the inside, or both? Itâ&#128;&#153;s a property of a piece of information&#13;
&#13;
                whether or not it shows up outside. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not the case that we have an external&#13;
&#13;
                website and an internal website. Conceptually, what we want is a body of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                   205&#13;
&amp;#12;                information, some parts of which should be visible outside, and other parts not&#13;
&#13;
                visible outside. Weâ&#128;&#153;re still, to some extent taking baby steps, I think, albeit&#13;
&#13;
                again paying homage to people like Flavia Fonseca and Ramesh Siva and other&#13;
&#13;
                people who understand this stuff.     My sense is that the Bank has a better&#13;
&#13;
                understanding intellectually of whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on here than most other&#13;
&#13;
                organizations that I talk to.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      In endeavoring to ensure business continuity under unusual circumstances e.g.&#13;
&#13;
                the Y2K millennium bug, including security related circumstances as in the&#13;
&#13;
                wake of September 11, how adequately has the ISG team addressed these&#13;
&#13;
                challenges? And is there a need for a reevaluation of its services also in the&#13;
&#13;
                event of disaster recovery?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, let me start. And youâ&#128;&#153;re getting a biased answer here because I was&#13;
&#13;
                responsible for the Y2K effort in the Bank. The Bank was aware of the Y2K&#13;
&#13;
                problems very early on, back in â&#128;&#152;96, â&#128;&#153;97, I think. The focus was on actually&#13;
&#13;
                getting people to pay attention. This was a coordinated effort, which started to&#13;
&#13;
                occur before the consolidation effort and the appointment of Mohamed as the&#13;
&#13;
                CIO and continued on after that. And it was after that that I became responsible&#13;
&#13;
                for it. The Y2K activity involved all parts of the Bank, but we were the focal&#13;
&#13;
                point to begin with.      It involved the General Services Department and it&#13;
&#13;
                involved every organizational unit in the Bank that developed computer&#13;
&#13;
                applications on their own and that included Treasurers and Health Services and a&#13;
&#13;
                number of others. So we had General Services Department plus myriad other&#13;
&#13;
                departments. We were also coordinating with IFC, which had its own activity,&#13;
&#13;
                and coordinating with external parties. This was primarily a guidance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            206&#13;
&amp;#12;                coordination effort. We could dictate what was done within ISG but we had to&#13;
&#13;
                use letâ&#128;&#153;s say collaborative methods to ensure that others within the Bank were&#13;
&#13;
                doing their part. And this was not just information systems. We also had to&#13;
&#13;
                look at the physical infrastructure systems as well and most of these were the&#13;
&#13;
                responsibility of GSD.      The impetus for this effort was within ISG. As we&#13;
&#13;
                moved along in this activity, we developed our own database. We brought&#13;
&#13;
                together the inventory of both hardware and application systems. Assessments&#13;
&#13;
                were made as to whether the applications and hardware were compliant. The&#13;
&#13;
                first meeting that I went to was back in early â&#128;&#153;97 with Clem Steyer, who had the&#13;
&#13;
                initial responsibility for this. The meeting was with the Treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s Department&#13;
&#13;
                and number of others.       The initial feedback given was, â&#128;&#156;We donâ&#128;&#153;t have a&#13;
&#13;
                problem; weâ&#128;&#153;re OK.â&#128;? As it turned out â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;? as in the World Bank or â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       No, this was as in the Treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s Department, which had its development staff.&#13;
&#13;
                They said, â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re OK. This is not an issue for us. Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to deal with&#13;
&#13;
                this.â&#128;? As people started to look at the systems and make the assessments, it&#13;
&#13;
                turned out we were not OK. Things had to be changed. The realization came&#13;
&#13;
                early that our All-In-One mail system was not going to be Y2K compliant. It&#13;
&#13;
                was an old system. The vendor was not going to make it Y2K compliant. We&#13;
&#13;
                were in the transition to Notes, but we werenâ&#128;&#153;t there yet. We had to look at the&#13;
&#13;
                desktops operating systems and many more things on the servers. This caused&#13;
&#13;
                us to bring together the information that has since been needed in other areas&#13;
&#13;
                into a consolidated inventory of applications.    A consolidated inventory of&#13;
&#13;
                hardware and a monitoring mechanism that reported on a monthly basis where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                            207&#13;
&amp;#12;                we were in bringing the systems, etc. into Y2K compliance.            There were&#13;
&#13;
                procedures that were developed. Essentially we adopted and modified external&#13;
&#13;
                proven procedures for the testing and the stages that the systems went through.&#13;
&#13;
                SAP was a part of this. SAP was implemented on July 14th of 1999, six months&#13;
&#13;
                before Y2K. We formed a group to do integrated testing with the Finance&#13;
&#13;
                Complex. We advanced the dates on our servers to take us through the Y2K&#13;
&#13;
                rollover period and then actually onto February 28th. The testing done was&#13;
&#13;
                across the Bank was on the application systems and hardware. It was a major&#13;
&#13;
                activity that brought together all parts of the Bank that had a stake in this. We&#13;
&#13;
                had done planning before the rollover period itself. We formed a team and&#13;
&#13;
                staffed it around the clock for just prior to New Years and through until â&#128;&#147; I think&#13;
&#13;
                it was about January 3, 2000 â&#128;&#147; before we said, â&#128;&#156;OK we can take things back&#13;
&#13;
                down to a normal operation.â&#128;? And fortunately, along with a large number of&#13;
&#13;
                other organizations, we came through this without any problems.&#13;
&#13;
                Part way into the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s own Y2K activity there was a realization that the&#13;
&#13;
                borrowers may have some issues as well. The question was what were our risks&#13;
&#13;
                from a Y2K standpoint to the projects that our clients have implemented and are&#13;
&#13;
                implementing? There was coordination with the regions on this, initially with&#13;
&#13;
                the resident missions, the country offices as to their contact with governments&#13;
&#13;
                and their readiness. We worked with External Affairs on alerting the world to&#13;
&#13;
                this. The Bank had a presence, had a stake in this as an organization. Early on,&#13;
&#13;
                Mohamed said, â&#128;&#156;ISG can handle, the internal [transition] and we can handle our&#13;
&#13;
                country offices but for the support for the developing countries, we need&#13;
&#13;
                assistance.â&#128;? This activity, which we had taken on initially working through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               208&#13;
&amp;#12;                resident missionsâ&#128;&#153; country offices, was shifted over to the InfoDev program.&#13;
&#13;
                This is where Carlos Braga and company came in. They received some external&#13;
&#13;
                funding. The UK saw this as a real challenge and potential disaster if actions&#13;
&#13;
                werenâ&#128;&#153;t taken. They provided, I think, 10 million pounds for this. The U.S.&#13;
&#13;
                Government came through with, I think, $10 million U.S. and fund raising&#13;
&#13;
                efforts were initiated to bring in additional funding.        I think the Italians,&#13;
&#13;
                Canadians, Swiss and others came in with funding. Those funds were used for&#13;
&#13;
                creating a guide for developing countries. They also provided grant funds for an&#13;
&#13;
                initial planning grant, to a maximum of $100 thousand. There was also a small&#13;
&#13;
                implementation grant up to $500 thousand.       This was seed money. I think in&#13;
&#13;
                total about $36 million was donated to this effort. At one point I participated in&#13;
&#13;
                the external transition as well as working on the internal project. I went to&#13;
&#13;
                Vietnam and China for Y2K seminars with those countries.               Government&#13;
&#13;
                officials were provided briefings by a series of people knowledgeable in the&#13;
&#13;
                field; then the grant activities were carried on through the InfoDev. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
                had not only the internal role of insuring that our computing infrastructure and&#13;
&#13;
                our physical infrastructure were together but it also was, I think, a major catalyst&#13;
&#13;
                in terms of providing guidance and funds to developing countries, getting the&#13;
&#13;
                message out, coordinating with the UN. Now, large kudos should go to Carlos&#13;
&#13;
                Braga and the InfoDev people on this. Y2K was a major undertaking and it&#13;
&#13;
                went well.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I have little to add to this. George carried this whole load and I didnâ&#128;&#153;t even have&#13;
&#13;
                to think about it, except for working sixteen hours over the New Yearâ&#128;&#153;s holiday.&#13;
&#13;
                I was there as part of one of the rollover groups. A sequence of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                209&#13;
&amp;#12;                senior IT leadership come in to do a shift with a team so I was there the night&#13;
&#13;
                that we rolled over.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       We had testing going on in the field offices also. We developed test procedures&#13;
&#13;
                where we brought down the servers in the field offices during that period. They&#13;
&#13;
                were tested prior to coming back up and we monitored this with each of the&#13;
&#13;
                country offices reporting in to us. The only hiccup we had there was at one of&#13;
&#13;
                the country offices someone had difficulty getting in to the Headquarters office.&#13;
&#13;
                They were about three or four hours late in reporting and we were wondering&#13;
&#13;
                what was going on there.           There was also a strong liaison with the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
                Government in this activity. I recall attending monthly meetings with Mr. John&#13;
&#13;
                Koskinen and company, who is now a City Administrator in the DC&#13;
&#13;
                Government.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Was this part of the U.S. Government Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Council on Y2K?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, yes.    We were an ex officio participant in that and I attended those&#13;
&#13;
                meetings. So we were well represented. Not only on an international level but&#13;
&#13;
                also with the U.S. Government with whom we coordinated.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well, in the event of disaster as in bombings, or in the face of natural disasters,&#13;
&#13;
                what happens to business continuity and security under these unusual&#13;
&#13;
                circumstances?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, let me start and Dee, you jump in here. I think security has always been a&#13;
&#13;
                concern. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been something that we havenâ&#128;&#153;t talked about in a public forum.&#13;
&#13;
                And even prior to, I guess it was post-Y2K, these were always concerns that we&#13;
&#13;
                had about the aspects of security from hackers externally, from disruptions by&#13;
&#13;
                protesters at the Spring Meetings and Annual Meetings. Early on we mobilized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               210&#13;
&amp;#12;                around events to ensure that the degree of monitoring we were doing, not only&#13;
&#13;
                of our external website but of our entire infrastructure, was at a level that we&#13;
&#13;
                could easily detect any issues or problems. The same thing occurs in the virus&#13;
&#13;
                area. I mean any potential external disruption is a cause for concern. Now&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;re organized internally; weâ&#128;&#153;re a 24/7 operation, so what weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about&#13;
&#13;
                here is increasing the level of monitoring and awareness around points in time&#13;
&#13;
                when we think there are potential external threats.&#13;
&#13;
                One area of concern is what we call the DMZ, where we have servers that are&#13;
&#13;
                accessible by external parties. Weâ&#128;&#153;re constantly monitoring that. On a monthly&#13;
&#13;
                and even daily basis, thereâ&#128;&#153;s internal monitoring that is going on. There are&#13;
&#13;
                intrusion detection operations as well. In the past there had been periodic hiring&#13;
&#13;
                of an external party to see if they could break in to our systems. We also&#13;
&#13;
                coordinated with IFC on their activities in this area and coordinated with the&#13;
&#13;
                IMF and IFC around the key events as well, Annual Meetings and special&#13;
&#13;
                meetings of that nature. September 11th is post my time but some of the base&#13;
&#13;
                that has been built proved useful and what September 11th caused is for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                to look again at the need for an external hot site in addition to the kind of backup&#13;
&#13;
                arrangements that we have right now in the H and J Buildings. This is in&#13;
&#13;
                process of being reviewed as we speak.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       As I had something to do with that; I can maybe say something about it.&#13;
&#13;
                Historically, one of the ways of looking at the question of contingency planning,&#13;
&#13;
                disaster protection is determining what kind of an event are you trying to protect&#13;
&#13;
                against? And of what scale of an event are you trying to protect against? We&#13;
&#13;
                historically focused on an event that would incapacitate a building. If for some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                211&#13;
&amp;#12;                reason we were to lose the H Building, where most of the computers have been&#13;
&#13;
                located, most of the switching equipment is located, most of the connections to&#13;
&#13;
                the country offices are located, what would our response be? What would be&#13;
&#13;
                our capacity to recover from that? We had a set of equipment in another&#13;
&#13;
                building two blocks away which would enable us to recover to some extent from&#13;
&#13;
                the loss of this one building. But the thing that troubled us and it kept being&#13;
&#13;
                raised over the course of the last ten years was: is that far enough away? Is&#13;
&#13;
                there a concern that we would be the victim of some kind of an event that would&#13;
&#13;
                incapacitate both buildings? And if you try to analyze this situation objectively,&#13;
&#13;
                you ask yourself, â&#128;&#156;What are the threats that we are trying to protect against?&#13;
&#13;
                What kinds of events could occur?â&#128;? And, â&#128;&#156;What is the likelihood of those&#13;
&#13;
                threats materializing?â&#128;? We not only did this analysis ourselves, we had other&#13;
&#13;
                professional firms come in to analyze it. Most recently, in April 2001, we had&#13;
&#13;
                Marsh &amp; McLennan, who specializes in this area, come in to evaluate this.&#13;
&#13;
                What is the likelihood on a 100-year basis of a flood of the Potomac that would&#13;
&#13;
                reach both buildings? Or, earth movement that would bring down the buildings?&#13;
&#13;
                Or, God forbid, a meteor hitting us. There was all kinds of analysis of the kinds&#13;
&#13;
                of events that could result in incapacity of both buildings. And this extends to&#13;
&#13;
                things like, â&#128;&#156;Are these things on separate power grids? Could we have some&#13;
&#13;
                kind of a problem in which the power would go out â&#128;&#147; not an unreasonable thing&#13;
&#13;
                to happen â&#128;&#147; that would take out both buildings? Or water main problems.â&#128;? So&#13;
&#13;
                this was looked at very thoroughly. Before September 11th, we thought a lot&#13;
&#13;
                about accidents.     We thought about trucks that could spill chemicals in the&#13;
&#13;
                street, or whatever.     One of the things that probably hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been so much&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              212&#13;
&amp;#12;                thought about before September 11th was an intentional biological or chemical&#13;
&#13;
                or projectile attack against a whole area.      In April 2001, after realistically&#13;
&#13;
                looking at all of the categories of threats and the kinds of occurrences which&#13;
&#13;
                could extend beyond a single building and take out both buildings, the only&#13;
&#13;
                threat that we concluded, that Marsh &amp; McLennan concluded, that we were still&#13;
&#13;
                a bit vulnerable on was a particular kind of water main problem. So we took&#13;
&#13;
                steps to do something about that. After September 11th, we decided to go back&#13;
&#13;
                and look at this again but with a view to whether it is possible for people to do&#13;
&#13;
                things intentionally that would extend to multiple city blocks? And of course,&#13;
&#13;
                the answer is, â&#128;&#156;Yes. Yes, you could release biological materials in downtown&#13;
&#13;
                Washington, DC that could make it impossible for us to get to both of these&#13;
&#13;
                buildings.â&#128;? So thereâ&#128;&#153;s an effort going on now at some cost to implement a&#13;
&#13;
                capacity for us to continue the operations at some distance from downtown. But&#13;
&#13;
                now, you start saying, â&#128;&#156;Well, OK, if some single building can be destroyed, then&#13;
&#13;
                the next step is multiple city blocks.â&#128;? Beyond that you say, â&#128;&#156;Is it possible that&#13;
&#13;
                the entire Washington DC area could be wiped out?â&#128;? When you get to that level&#13;
&#13;
                of concern, you start talking about a comet hitting the earth in this area or a&#13;
&#13;
                nuclear explosion or that kind of thing. Accompanying that kind of a threat is a&#13;
&#13;
                huge loss of life, probably. At that point youâ&#128;&#153;re actually talking about an&#13;
&#13;
                entirely different thing. Youâ&#128;&#153;re not talking about business continuity. Youâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
&#13;
                talking about the survival of the institution at all, the survival of the economy of&#13;
&#13;
                this country and of the world. And you have to ask yourself a different set of&#13;
&#13;
                questions about what you want the Bank to be able to do in that kind of an&#13;
&#13;
                eventuality, I think. Anyway, that discussion is going on. We are looking hard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                213&#13;
&amp;#12;                at opening a capacity to have some reproduction of our ability, of our capacity&#13;
&#13;
                of the H Building, in a place 30 to 50 miles away, probably 20 to 30 miles away.&#13;
&#13;
                We are not at the present putting forward a proposal to protect ourselves against&#13;
&#13;
                a total area-wide disaster: the comet, the nuclear explosion. Weâ&#128;&#153;re not going to&#13;
&#13;
                invest the kind of money needed to protect against that kind of thing. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
                much larger number. Weâ&#128;&#153;re going to put what these eventualities are on the&#13;
&#13;
                table with senior management but I think at the moment our recommendation is&#13;
&#13;
                that we should protect ourselves against the multiple block kind of a problem&#13;
&#13;
                and prepare for getting 20 miles away. But not try to protect ourselves against&#13;
&#13;
                the nuclear strike. Do you want to talk about security? We talked about disaster&#13;
&#13;
                protection.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      OK, the security aspect of it.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       There are a couple of points here that may be need to be brought up. These&#13;
&#13;
                points will lead us to things like the directive on Disclosure of Information and&#13;
&#13;
                the issues about the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s particular character as an organization overseen by a&#13;
&#13;
                Board of Executive Directors who are representatives of their governments that&#13;
&#13;
                sits on the premises of the Bank but who are not members of the Bank. And the&#13;
&#13;
                concerns that particular issue raises for us. Also, our evolution in terms of our&#13;
&#13;
                understanding of the challenges of sharing information: transparency versus&#13;
&#13;
                protecting confidentiality and integrity of our information. We are like a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                other organizations in that as our understanding of how to address the business&#13;
&#13;
                challenges matures our understanding of how to apply technology to it changes.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Weâ&#128;&#153;re talking now specifically about the security of information in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                214&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Yes. In a world in which we are increasingly building electronic bridges with&#13;
&#13;
                everyone else, we are increasingly one big fabric of information. We face the&#13;
&#13;
                challenges of both becoming a modern organization that enables us to share&#13;
&#13;
                information with our stakeholders across our boundaries and to conduct business&#13;
&#13;
                as a global organization composed of people who are more or less loosely&#13;
&#13;
                connected to the Bank. That is, we employ consultants, increasingly, to do work&#13;
&#13;
                and those consultants have to participate in the forming of reports and the access&#13;
&#13;
                to information, but they may never be physically present in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                buildings.    Weâ&#128;&#153;ve mentioned the CDF before.            Increasingly we are in&#13;
&#13;
                partnership with everyone else and forming the country system strategy for a&#13;
&#13;
                particular country and the implementation of that.          All of this presents&#13;
&#13;
                challenges for us. How do we set up the technology in such a way that itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                possible for us to share what needs to be shared and protect what needs to be&#13;
&#13;
                protected? Initially, the way that organizations did this in the â&#128;&#153;90s was to set up&#13;
&#13;
                these perimeters, the so-called "fire walls".   Our stuff is on the inside of this&#13;
&#13;
                wall and we build this wall around it. Other material is outside the wall. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                increasingly come to understand that this is a very weak model. I want to&#13;
&#13;
                contrast that view, that picture in your mind, of this wall around our electronic&#13;
&#13;
                frontier with our directive on social disclosure of information.       Our policy&#13;
&#13;
                framework for the sharing of information is partly manifest in the document&#13;
&#13;
                classification schema that we have left over from the â&#128;&#153;50s in which we&#13;
&#13;
                categorize information in the Bank as Public, Official Use Only, Confidential&#13;
&#13;
                and Strictly Confidential. The definition of information which is for Official&#13;
&#13;
                Use Only is that it may be shared with everyone who is a member of the World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               215&#13;
&amp;#12;                Bank staff and with no one else. This is a definition that has its roots in a world&#13;
&#13;
                in which all information was in paper form and it was in filing cabinets. The&#13;
&#13;
                general perception was that if it was in a filing cabinet inside the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                premises, it was perfectly sensible for us to say, â&#128;&#156;Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s not Confidential;&#13;
&#13;
                therefore anybody can walk up to the filing cabinet and look at it.â&#128;? In fact we&#13;
&#13;
                didnâ&#128;&#153;t really think that anybody would look at it. Only people who had a reason&#13;
&#13;
                or some interest in it would look at it. But there was no particular reason for us&#13;
&#13;
                to apply greater security to it. Contrast that with the modern world. Nowadays,&#13;
&#13;
                itâ&#128;&#153;s possible for people to sit in their office and scan all the documents in the&#13;
&#13;
                whole place to quickly assemble the entire project file for a sensitive operation&#13;
&#13;
                and send that out by email to The New York Times. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a trivial matter to do if&#13;
&#13;
                these documents are available to everyone in the Bank. Furthermore, recall that&#13;
&#13;
                I was trying to parallel that with this whole issue of building the wall around our&#13;
&#13;
                electronic fence, this fence around our internal versus external. Bear in mind&#13;
&#13;
                that the internal network is available to anyone who has access to the buildings.&#13;
&#13;
                That is to say, if you have a pass to walk in the door, Professor Becker, then you&#13;
&#13;
                have access to our internal network.&#13;
&#13;
                Therefore, the proposition that we can protect information under the disclosure&#13;
&#13;
                rules to only be available to World Bank staff by putting up this electronic&#13;
&#13;
                boundary around our internal network is just not true. The set of people who&#13;
&#13;
                have access to our internal network is not congruent with the set of people who&#13;
&#13;
                the policy says ought to have access to it. You canâ&#128;&#153;t simply say, â&#128;&#156;If we make&#13;
&#13;
                documents available on the internal network we therefore are in compliance&#13;
&#13;
                with the policy that only Bank staff can see them.â&#128;? In fact, we reckon that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               216&#13;
&amp;#12;                probably something on the order of 25,000 people have access to our internal&#13;
&#13;
                network and only something like 40% of those people are actually Bank staff&#13;
&#13;
                members. Moreover the rule itself doesnâ&#128;&#153;t make any sense. The set of people&#13;
&#13;
                who ought to have access to a document that is in preparation includes not only&#13;
&#13;
                Bank staff but people who are external parties working on that document: -&#13;
&#13;
                consultants, stakeholders in the government, other international organizations&#13;
&#13;
                that weâ&#128;&#153;re in partnership with. We need a much richer understanding of what it&#13;
&#13;
                is weâ&#128;&#153;re trying to protect and from whom and what the rules are that we need to&#13;
&#13;
                apply to protect that information. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a very difficult, challenging situation.&#13;
&#13;
                The directive on Disclosure of Information has just been revamped. Naturally,&#13;
&#13;
                the focus of that work is on which types of formal documents ought to be&#13;
&#13;
                available to the stakeholders and to which stakeholders. In actuality, that makes&#13;
&#13;
                it all the more difficult for us because, of course, the information doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                organize itself very naturally under these document types. If weâ&#128;&#153;re obliged to&#13;
&#13;
                share economic or environmental assessments but weâ&#128;&#153;re not supposed to share&#13;
&#13;
                country assistance strategies and somebody takes a document out of the middle&#13;
&#13;
                of one of these strategies and scans it, is it a secret or is it not? I mean the&#13;
&#13;
                confidentiality of the information hasnâ&#128;&#153;t really much to do with the form in&#13;
&#13;
                which itâ&#128;&#153;s been brought together, if you see what I mean. So we had a whole&#13;
&#13;
                new set of challenges, here. Both electronic challenges and conceptual.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      In addressing the content side of information, Mr. West, is there anything youâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
                like to add to the security of information content?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think Dee has outlined it pretty well. It does cause the questions of what has&#13;
&#13;
                come up in the context of whatâ&#128;&#153;s accessible to the EDs. I can recall back in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             217&#13;
&amp;#12;                days of the OPSMIS when the data in that system was not accessible to EDs&#13;
&#13;
                because that was work in process. I think that further work in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
                evolution of the Information Disclosure needs to be done to take into account â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
                not just the electronic aspects of this but also the aspects of partnership. What is&#13;
&#13;
                it that you share with partners as opposed to what do you keep internally? I&#13;
&#13;
                mean this has even come up in the context of the Archives because I believe&#13;
&#13;
                they have agreed to roll back the non-disclosure period. It used to be 30 years&#13;
&#13;
                and now its 20. And it will probably come down even more in the future.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How do events such as September 11th affect disclosure of information from&#13;
&#13;
                letâ&#128;&#153;s say our client governmentâ&#128;&#153;s perspective?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think that we are aware that we live in a world that has a lot of potential&#13;
&#13;
                dangers. Our awareness of that has been heightened by September 11th. But I&#13;
&#13;
                think that more than September 11th, it is the events at the World Trade&#13;
&#13;
                Organization meeting [in Seattle in 1999] that was really a wake up call for us.&#13;
&#13;
                Almost anyone who is in our business will tell you that there the only way to&#13;
&#13;
                protect information that is in computer systems is to encase them in concrete and&#13;
&#13;
                send them to the bottom of the ocean. If you connect these computers to&#13;
&#13;
                networks, then if some senior manager asks, â&#128;&#156;Is it possible for us to provide&#13;
&#13;
                100% percent protection?â&#128;? weâ&#128;&#153;d have to say, â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;? We would always have to&#13;
&#13;
                say, â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;? On the other hand, letâ&#128;&#153;s contrast this with the way you live your life&#13;
&#13;
                in your house. You have a lock on your front door. And you know very well&#13;
&#13;
                that there are 500,000 locksmiths in this country that can open your front door in&#13;
&#13;
                a matter of seconds if they want to. And you count on the fact that by and large&#13;
&#13;
                they donâ&#128;&#153;t want to.      They have professional associations, they have their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                218&#13;
&amp;#12;                accreditation, they have their concern about their reputation and most of all they&#13;
&#13;
                mostly donâ&#128;&#153;t want to get into your house because thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing in there they&#13;
&#13;
                want. Youâ&#128;&#153;re comfortable; you can sleep at night even though you know that&#13;
&#13;
                you donâ&#128;&#153;t have 100% security. You have enough security for the world you live&#13;
&#13;
                in. The same thing is true of the Bank. We had to set the bar at a certain level.&#13;
&#13;
                Not 100%, but at a level that was appropriate for the kinds of threats that we&#13;
&#13;
                expected to have to endure. I think what happened was that in Seattle we&#13;
&#13;
                recognized that the bar had been raised. Whereas before that, we thought, well,&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re a pretty benign organization, you know, we donâ&#128;&#153;t have any trade secrets.&#13;
&#13;
                Weâ&#128;&#153;re very much in the business of trying to publish what we do. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
&#13;
                relatively small amount of stuff that we try to keep secret. Truthfully there&#13;
&#13;
                arenâ&#128;&#153;t that many people interested in getting at it. And in particular, the kind of&#13;
&#13;
                people who have the skills to get across electronic boundaries are not the kind of&#13;
&#13;
                people who are very interested in . . .â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      The type of information that we have.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes. So we were able to put the bar at a certain level and be confident that we&#13;
&#13;
                were OK. All of a sudden, after Seattle, with the anti-globalization movements,&#13;
&#13;
                we were suddenly a target for a set of people who perhaps could mobilize the&#13;
&#13;
                skills in some misguided zeal towards bringing down some paragon of&#13;
&#13;
                globalization. We had to worry about a whole new class of threats.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This was not so much because they were interested in the information. They&#13;
&#13;
                were interested in disrupting the operations of the organization. And that was&#13;
&#13;
                what Seattle was all about. That was a wake up call for us and I think the April,&#13;
&#13;
                2000 Meetings â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               219&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      The Spring meetings here in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       The Spring meetings, the April spring meetings. We were monitoring the April&#13;
&#13;
                16th website along with the physical security people. At one point you could go&#13;
&#13;
                into the I Building [where ISG is located] but a day later there were&#13;
&#13;
                demonstrators blocking the entrances into the building. But we had prepared&#13;
&#13;
                and we knew what was going on from people attempting to get in. And in&#13;
&#13;
                certain cases, we actually blocked what we considered to be suspicious activity.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       But I think, the message here is in our understanding of the threat; the threat has&#13;
&#13;
                changed over the last couple of years. It puts some new pressures on ISG.&#13;
&#13;
                Because on the one hand we have these changed threats and on the other hand&#13;
&#13;
                we have an increasingly global environment. The old way of doing business&#13;
&#13;
                with this security perimeter business was that your access to information was&#13;
&#13;
                very much a property not who you were but of where you were. If you were&#13;
&#13;
                located inside the Bank buildings, no matter who you were, you could get access&#13;
&#13;
                to information. If you were outside the Bank building, no matter whether you&#13;
&#13;
                were Bank staff or not, you couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get access very well. We had some not&#13;
&#13;
                very satisfying technological capabilities for Bank staff that were traveling&#13;
&#13;
                overseas and not being able to access information. By and large they were very&#13;
&#13;
                awkward and troublesome.           Also we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have good ways of making it&#13;
&#13;
                possible for the Minister of Finance of this or that country to be able to get&#13;
&#13;
                access to the same information which the EDs could get access to. Mostly&#13;
&#13;
                people didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand why that was so. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t make sense in some ways.&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s because we have relatively primitive mechanisms, technologically speaking,&#13;
&#13;
                to implement a very rich and complex real-world environment. We have quite a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               220&#13;
&amp;#12;                lot of work to do in this area to change it from a world in which what you can&#13;
&#13;
                get access to is dependent on where you are to change to a world in which what&#13;
&#13;
                you can get access to as a function of who you are. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s to say, what your job&#13;
&#13;
                is, what your role is with respect to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       What Dee is talking about is role-based access, something the Bank is wrestling&#13;
&#13;
                with right now.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       As a retiree, as an external consultant Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been doing a technology assessment&#13;
&#13;
                for Mohamed. One of the focuses of which is, what are the chief challenges, the&#13;
&#13;
                two or three big challenges that weâ&#128;&#153;ll confront over the next few years? And&#13;
&#13;
                this whole issue of security is number one on my list. We talked about one&#13;
&#13;
                aspect of it; there are other aspects of it, too â&#128;&#147; digital signatures in the world in&#13;
&#13;
                which things are increasingly being signed electronically. There are all sorts of&#13;
&#13;
                aspects of this security environment which the Bank like everyone else is going&#13;
&#13;
                to have to adapt over the next few years. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a big challenge and a big issue.&#13;

McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  221&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Good morning. This is December 4, 2001 and Professor Becker and I are here for our&#13;
&#13;
                fifth session covering a retrospective on the evolution of technology applications at the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank with Messrs. William McDonald (Dee) Buck and George W. West. We finished&#13;
&#13;
                talking in our fourth session about ensuring business continuity and security of business&#13;
&#13;
                under unusual circumstances related to technology. Let me begin my asking you the&#13;
&#13;
                following. First, in your opinion, how have perceptions about technology changed over&#13;
&#13;
                the years in the Bank and how different are they from other large-scale organizations?&#13;
&#13;
                And second, how much are these changed perceptions due to the top leadership in ISG?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, let me start. The perceptions on how technology has changed over the years, I&#13;
&#13;
                think, is one in which from the time I entered the Bank, technology was clearly&#13;
&#13;
                regarded as a backroom support activity. And other than telephones â&#128;&#147; which were not&#13;
&#13;
                part of the original mandate of the then-Computing Activities Department â&#128;&#147; technology&#13;
&#13;
                did not affect the lives of a good part of the Bank staff. Currently, everyone is using&#13;
&#13;
                standard hardware and software and is connected electronically to everyone else in the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank, which is now taken for granted. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a part of the background that everyone&#13;
&#13;
                assumes is there and only shows up when there is a breakdown.            So I think the&#13;
&#13;
                perception is that â&#128;&#156;I need technology to do my job nowâ&#128;?. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not a backroom activity&#13;
&#13;
                now; it may be performing backroom functions in certain areas but every member of the&#13;
&#13;
                staff uses technology one way or another to do parts and pieces of their work and in&#13;
&#13;
                some cases technology is their job. So itâ&#128;&#153;s moved from the periphery to the mainstream&#13;
&#13;
                within the Bank. How is this different from other large-scale organizations? I think&#13;
&#13;
                that weâ&#128;&#153;re right there with everyone else. Technology is performing some of the same&#13;
&#13;
                functions that it used to do but itâ&#128;&#153;s also performing new functions and itâ&#128;&#153;s performing&#13;
&#13;
                them in different ways.       I also think itâ&#128;&#153;s been a leveler within the organization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              222&#13;
&amp;#12;                Previously, paper memos were only sent to certain people. E-mail now is ubiquitous&#13;
&#13;
                and anyone can send a message to anyone else in the organization, and does. If&#13;
&#13;
                someone has a complaint it can go to the President. Now this doesnâ&#128;&#153;t say that the&#13;
&#13;
                President is going to read it, but someone in the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office is going to read it.&#13;
&#13;
                So, I think it has had a major impact. Other organizations, I think, have experienced&#13;
&#13;
                similar kinds of change.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      And how much of these perceptions are also due to the top leadership in ISG?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think the top leadership has played a major role in bringing this technology to the&#13;
&#13;
                organization in a cost-effective manner and in a manner that has been accepted.&#13;
&#13;
                Technology brings change. Some people for whatever reasons are not as amenable to&#13;
&#13;
                change as others. But I think that the leadership within the organization has been right&#13;
&#13;
                in step in bringing senior management along and basically creating the environment in&#13;
&#13;
                which the technology could be and was accepted in the organization. I think a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                this is because the way technology was framed and introduced in the Bank. It was not&#13;
&#13;
                delivered in a manner that caused a great deal of pushback.         We did have some&#13;
&#13;
                resistance to SAP but that resistance has been overcome. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t mean that there&#13;
&#13;
                arenâ&#128;&#153;t some people saying SAP could do things better, and should do things better. I&#13;
&#13;
                would say a lot of credit goes to Mohamed during this last five-, six-year period for&#13;
&#13;
                positioning ISG and working with the senior management and the other VPUs within&#13;
&#13;
                the organization, to create the technology environment that we have now and which is&#13;
&#13;
                used by everyone on a daily basis.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think that there are two or three interrelated forces at work in the evolution, in&#13;
&#13;
                peopleâ&#128;&#153;s perceptions about IT, information and technology. One is the evolution of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              223&#13;
&amp;#12;                area in the world at large, the technological revolution and the extent to which people in&#13;
&#13;
                their daily lives are exposed to it and have come to expect it to be part of their lives.&#13;
&#13;
                Certainly, as George said, in the â&#128;&#153;70s that was not the case. Most people had nothing to&#13;
&#13;
                do with computers, would never use one, never touched one, didnâ&#128;&#153;t expect to ever use&#13;
&#13;
                one, had a fundamental mistrust of them and correspondingly had some level of distrust&#13;
&#13;
                with that part of the Bank that was charged with bringing computers to the Bank. Over&#13;
&#13;
                time thatâ&#128;&#153;s evolved quite independently of what is going on in the Bank. It just has&#13;
&#13;
                happened and the internet phenomenon â&#128;¦we were talking off the record a little while&#13;
&#13;
                ago about people in their own households beginning to supply digital music to their&#13;
&#13;
                kids. All of this is happening to everyone at the same time, taken together with the&#13;
&#13;
                natural evolution of the Bank staff. As the older staff like George and I leave and the&#13;
&#13;
                newer staff come along, these are all people that grew up with computers and so there&#13;
&#13;
                are all those kinds of changes that are going on. Independent of that, there is a set of&#13;
&#13;
                things that have been done in the Bank by the technology folks to try to improve the&#13;
&#13;
                degree of acceptance. I, at least, am very fond of this taxonomy of looking at the way&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank uses technology in terms of the technology being supplied to individuals, the&#13;
&#13;
                technology we supply for business process and the technology we supply for interaction&#13;
&#13;
                with our stakeholders, our borrowers and donors. Then, there is the aspect of what I&#13;
&#13;
                think is the digital divide question, which is the role of the Bank in trying to foster&#13;
&#13;
                information economics, if you will. The use of technology in the governments we&#13;
&#13;
                serve, or the countries we serve.&#13;
&#13;
                I think an important lesson that ISG learned somewhere in the â&#128;&#153;90s was that nobody&#13;
&#13;
                was going to pay attention to us as a vehicle for change until we could get the basic&#13;
&#13;
                technology right, until we could provide computers that worked on an ongoing basis, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               224&#13;
&amp;#12;                well as telephones, and networks that were up, servers were that were up, until people&#13;
&#13;
                began to feel that the technology was going to be there when they needed it. Our&#13;
&#13;
                reputation as a technology provider was terrible. One of the things that the current&#13;
&#13;
                leadership, Mohamed, did in his early years here was to focus very hard on trying to get&#13;
&#13;
                the base-level infrastructure to work right. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure that you can separate the&#13;
&#13;
                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s reaction to these two evolving things and tease them apart and say this is&#13;
&#13;
                attributable to that and that is attributable to this, but I think that they were independent&#13;
&#13;
                forces working. As regards the systems, I think until we began to make some strides on&#13;
&#13;
                getting the personal infrastructure part working, the delivery of personal services&#13;
&#13;
                working, we had no credibility on the systems. Once we got that working, then we&#13;
&#13;
                began to have some credibility in talking about business process and were able to attack&#13;
&#13;
                this problem of the ERP implementation and the changing of the fundamental business&#13;
&#13;
                process. We gained some credibility to sit down at the table with the business process&#13;
&#13;
                owner and talk about ways in which technology can be applied to business process&#13;
&#13;
                problems.    Having now done that even with all the upheaval it caused and the&#13;
&#13;
                difficulties that we have talked about, it generates yet another level of credibility which&#13;
&#13;
                gets us a seat at the table to talk about how we begin to conduct better dialogue with our&#13;
&#13;
                borrowers and take that next step to actually talking about helping the Bank, to have the&#13;
&#13;
                conversation about what its role should be and trying to solve these dilemmas in the&#13;
&#13;
                digital divide, and what have you. I mean, how do we help governments solve some of&#13;
&#13;
                the same problems that all large organizations including the Bank have had to confront&#13;
&#13;
                in the western or the northern world I guess I should say?        One other point that you&#13;
&#13;
                asked was how different are we from other large-scale organizations?&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                 225&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       The evolution of technology in the world, of course is happening to everyone, but I&#13;
&#13;
                think there are some areas in which we are different. The World Bank IT organization&#13;
&#13;
                came to the realization that this was not simply about technology but was much more&#13;
&#13;
                about information.     I think that we were earlier than many other organizations in&#13;
&#13;
                recognizing the relationship there. Not to say that we have set the world on fire in being&#13;
&#13;
                able to solve those problems, not to say that we arenâ&#128;&#153;t still grappling with them and are&#13;
&#13;
                still taking baby steps. However, we came to realize the importance of this perhaps&#13;
&#13;
                earlier than most other organizations and certainly earlier than most of the public sector&#13;
&#13;
                informational organizations that I have any interaction with, the United Nations and the&#13;
&#13;
                governments and supranational agencies. As far as the technology itself is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
                though, I think that our problems are the same as everyone elseâ&#128;&#153;s.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      In moving forward, ambitious goals are set calling for the strengthening of ISGâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                capacity to achieve, including the opportunity to share its expertise beyond its internal&#13;
&#13;
                customers. Please describe some of the highlights of these challenges, i.e. enabling the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank to pursue social and economic development through e-business; helping the&#13;
&#13;
                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients with the challenges of e-government; enabling the Bank to promote the&#13;
&#13;
                use of ICT (information and communications technology) for poverty reduction and&#13;
&#13;
                sustainable development?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       These are good questions. They have all the right words in them. Again, I say in my&#13;
&#13;
                view we have these four echelons of challenges and these are in the last two echelons.&#13;
&#13;
                First, the conduct of our business with our customers and then with respect to our role at&#13;
&#13;
                promoting stronger economies of these countries, recognizing that may be very much a&#13;
&#13;
                function of the degree to which they can apply technology tools to solving their own&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               226&#13;
&amp;#12;                problems. Just as we have to do. As everyone has to do. As regards to ISGâ&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
&#13;
                â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Some of the things we are talking about here relate to taking what we have learned with&#13;
&#13;
                regard to our providing an internal service and expanding that to the clientele outside&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank. I know that the Mexican government came in and asked for some assistance.&#13;
&#13;
                I believe that ISG has engaged in a dialogue with them with regard to the kinds of&#13;
&#13;
                activities that weâ&#128;&#153;ve undertaken to make our environment stable and make our systems&#13;
&#13;
                support the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business. Pursuing social and economic development and this is for&#13;
&#13;
                some specific ministries within the Mexican government that discussions have been&#13;
&#13;
                held with. ISG has not done that on a large scale. We have â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      In China?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       In China.    This had more to do with the Global Distance Learning activities, the&#13;
&#13;
                establishment of a Global Distance Learning site in Ningxia Province that Mohamed&#13;
&#13;
                has actually visited and that has been I believe from a design standpoint at least a basis&#13;
&#13;
                for extending Global Distance Learning in multiple provinces within China. To that&#13;
&#13;
                extent, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Global Network, which was designed to support our internal&#13;
&#13;
                business, was then was extended to the Global Distance Learning centers and to the&#13;
&#13;
                specific examples of what we just talked about. There have been staff who have talked&#13;
&#13;
                with other development agencies about our activities, whether itâ&#128;&#153;s in SAP, whether itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                in global networking. We are a part of the UN community and periodically exchange&#13;
&#13;
                information with them. Regarding helping the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients with the challenges of e-&#13;
&#13;
                government, I think that there has been ongoing dialogue on at least what we know&#13;
&#13;
                about e-government. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know to what extent that this is incorporated into our&#13;
&#13;
                lending activities. I know that there is a great deal of ICT work embedded within the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               227&#13;
&amp;#12;                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending operations. There is also an aspect of that within the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Advisory&#13;
&#13;
                Services. I think weâ&#128;&#153;re in that business in at least ISG, not on a formal basis, but there&#13;
&#13;
                are opportunities and work is going on here. We face the problem, or ISG faces the&#13;
&#13;
                problem, of supporting the internal clients but then we have the demand from external&#13;
&#13;
                parties for sharing our information, knowledge and experience. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve done this on a&#13;
&#13;
                limited basis and I think the demand for that will increase as we go along. Dee, whatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                your view?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think this is a very fuzzy area at the moment, because I think George is absolutely&#13;
&#13;
                right. If you look at the span of the last 15 years, there has always been some degree of&#13;
&#13;
                demand for ISG or its predecessor organizations to be involved somehow in supporting&#13;
&#13;
                operational work. And yet we always had a very difficult time doing that primarily&#13;
&#13;
                because we are funded to provide a particular level of service and when we cross the&#13;
&#13;
                boundary away from providing purely internal service and begin to try to get involved&#13;
&#13;
                in the delivery of external service, it raises all kinds of issues for us. What kinds of&#13;
&#13;
                expertise do we have to have? What kinds of transformations do we need to make in&#13;
&#13;
                the skill levels in the staff? Are we really recruiting the right people to do this? And&#13;
&#13;
                then there are a whole set of budget issues. I think this is an area that is in flux. In part,&#13;
&#13;
                you were getting at this earlier with your questions, that because of the success that&#13;
&#13;
                ISG, and in particular the leadership of ISG, has had in increasing its credibility, there is&#13;
&#13;
                an increasing call for ISG to get involved in this kind of work. At the same time it is an&#13;
&#13;
                increasing area of importance, an area in which the Bank doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have any focus in a&#13;
&#13;
                particular area. Leaving us out of it, we do have Mohsen Khalilâ&#128;&#153;s group over in CIT&#13;
&#13;
                trying to puzzle out what their role ought to be and how it ought to be positioned and&#13;
&#13;
                how their role and our role ought to be coalesced. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why I say this is kind of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                  228&#13;
&amp;#12;                muddy area at the moment because almost everyone realizes that there is a growing&#13;
&#13;
                need to extend that into areas beyond our internal administrative responsibilities, that&#13;
&#13;
                ISG has a growing credibility in this area, that the work weâ&#128;&#153;re doing with distance&#13;
&#13;
                learning has demonstrated â&#128;&#147; as George pointed out â&#128;&#147; an ability to extend Mohamedâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                well-earned reputation for being able to deliver when asked. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t know how it is&#13;
&#13;
                going to play out. The way the question is couched here, it says, â&#128;&#156;ambitious goals are&#13;
&#13;
                set calling for strengthening of ISGâ&#128;&#153;s capacity.â&#128;? We have ambitious goals that call for a&#13;
&#13;
                strengthening of ISGâ&#128;&#153;s delivery without any increased capacity, and I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s what&#13;
&#13;
                worries me. If, in fact, we were to take on challenges like this, it has some implications&#13;
&#13;
                for resources. I am not aware of any growth in resources. The challenge for us will be,&#13;
&#13;
                how can we continue to deliver the basic services, continue to keep the trains running&#13;
&#13;
                on time, which is how we earned this credibility. But whatever credibility we have&#13;
&#13;
                earned, and Iâ&#128;&#153;m imagining some poor task manager out in Operations reading this&#13;
&#13;
                transcript and saying, â&#128;&#156;What do they mean, earned?â&#128;? We still have many problems, but&#13;
&#13;
                we have earned some credibility for an ability to keep the trains running. We canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
                sacrifice that in order to go chase after something that weâ&#128;&#153;re not really historically&#13;
&#13;
                resourced to do. And yet thereâ&#128;&#153;s a crying need. This is an area that is in transition. I&#13;
&#13;
                donâ&#128;&#153;t know how it will play out.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Now, to sum up, how would you characterize the evolution of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                standardization efforts using word processing systems, from pre-PC to todayâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                standards. What are the lessons learned and what are the concerns?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t confine it just to word processing systems. I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s a small part&#13;
&#13;
                of it. There actually was more standardization when we were in the mainframe phase&#13;
&#13;
                because it just allowed for it. In fact, some of the mainframe mechanisms, procedures,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               229&#13;
&amp;#12;                processes, have come around again to be implemented in non-mainframe areas. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                a recognition that it was easier to have standardization procedures in the mainframe&#13;
&#13;
                environment. But as the technology shifted from the mainframe to multiple servers and&#13;
&#13;
                I donâ&#128;&#153;t know the numbers but they may have six hundred servers worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure what it is.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s a big number in any event; three or four per country office, plus Washington. The&#13;
&#13;
                efforts to standardize have allowed ISG to manage a very complex technology&#13;
&#13;
                environment. Without the standardization the staffing would have to have grown to a&#13;
&#13;
                point where it couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have happened, it wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have been allowed by management.&#13;
&#13;
                Technology is always changing. When you are trying to standardize you have to be&#13;
&#13;
                nimble enough to move with change technology. Our efforts at standardizing had to be&#13;
&#13;
                balanced with some degree of flexibility that allowed the changes that always come.&#13;
&#13;
                We do have some of that within the environment. We have on the desktop a single&#13;
&#13;
                manufacturerâ&#128;&#153;s machine of a single model. That, I think, is a major achievement and it&#13;
&#13;
                does allow for supporting 10,000 people with a relatively small number of staff. So, I&#13;
&#13;
                think the standardization has been the way in which ISG has been able to gain control&#13;
&#13;
                over a large environment that most staff donâ&#128;&#153;t understand the complexity of. It is not&#13;
&#13;
                only standardization of the desktop, but beyond the physical wall itâ&#128;&#153;s the wiring within&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank, the number of protocols, servers, etc. Dee, in an earlier interview talked&#13;
&#13;
                about seven different communications protocols that have been reduced to a single&#13;
&#13;
                standard protocol. Standardization, I think, has been a key element in moving ISG into&#13;
&#13;
                the position that it now has within the Bank. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if I have answered your&#13;
&#13;
                question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             230&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      Yes you have. The next part of the question is, what are the lessons learned, and what&#13;
&#13;
                are the remaining concerns, if there remain any?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I think that one of the lessons learned here is when you go from an environment where&#13;
&#13;
                there are high degrees of freedom where anyone can select their own technology, that is&#13;
&#13;
                make their own hardware and software choices, you have a large-scale public relations&#13;
&#13;
                people problem. Making a declaration that this is the standard and you have to abide by&#13;
&#13;
                it is extremely difficult. You have to convince people that what you are doing is what&#13;
&#13;
                makes sense. Not only for the organization as a whole, but for their own specific area.&#13;
&#13;
                Itâ&#128;&#153;s about people and people using technology. What we have learned here is that this&#13;
&#13;
                is not just about technology. Management must recognize that technology exists in an&#13;
&#13;
                environment where people have vested interests and strong views â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      The organizational culture.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Itâ&#128;&#153;s organizational culture, itâ&#128;&#153;s the mix and technology is a part of it. But you donâ&#128;&#153;t use&#13;
&#13;
                technology without people. No organization this size has the power to just say, â&#128;&#156;this is&#13;
&#13;
                just the way itâ&#128;&#153;s going to beâ&#128;? without explaining â&#128;&#156;whyâ&#128;? and taking the time to engage in&#13;
&#13;
                dialogue to bring people along. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a lesson that we continue to learn. At the same&#13;
&#13;
                time, there is the pressure to move and get it done, make it happen. So, thatâ&#128;&#153;s an&#13;
&#13;
                ongoing concern and that concern doesnâ&#128;&#153;t go away.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m looking at this question, where it falls, and the end of the last question. In some&#13;
&#13;
                ways, you suggested that you were interested in this as a sort of summing up and the&#13;
&#13;
                specific focus on standardization is an interesting and kind of curious connection with&#13;
&#13;
                this sort of summing up.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Is it good or bad?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                231&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. Buck:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure. It may be the right way to look at it but I was reflecting as George was&#13;
&#13;
                talking about how to approach this subject of sort of summing up, what weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked&#13;
&#13;
                about.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well, if you have something to add on standardization, please feel free to do so.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       You triggered a thought; let me jump in here. What weâ&#128;&#153;re talking about here is not&#13;
&#13;
                standardization. Standardization is something we understand from the technology side&#13;
&#13;
                of this thing and to a limited degree you can present standardization as a means of&#13;
&#13;
                achieving objectives. I think what we have to do in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environment is not to&#13;
&#13;
                talk about standardization, per se, but to talk about meeting the specific needs of the&#13;
&#13;
                various client groups in the organization as a whole. That, I think, has been done; not&#13;
&#13;
                through just standardization, itâ&#128;&#153;s been done through a whole series of activities. Our&#13;
&#13;
                five-step kind of program, standardization of the kind of desktop environment was a&#13;
&#13;
                part of it. I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether that relates to your thinking or not.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       If you look over this span of history that we have covered, one of the characteristics that&#13;
&#13;
                perhaps would be an interesting statistic to know is how much computing capacity per&#13;
&#13;
                employee, how much reliance is there on technology today compared to the degree of&#13;
&#13;
                reliance that we had?      When we began this series of interviews I gave you some&#13;
&#13;
                statistics about the size of that first computer we had that served the whole Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
                Fund and everything that we were doing and contrasting that with the very complex&#13;
&#13;
                technical environment that we supply today. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not only the Bank, itâ&#128;&#153;s everywhere.&#13;
&#13;
                And I think that all of the questions about the role of ISG and the role of technology in&#13;
&#13;
                supporting the way we do work and the evolution of the way work is done not only in&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank and everywhere else calls for a very different approach, a very different&#13;
&#13;
                environment than we had when George and I joined the Bank. And itâ&#128;&#153;s in that way that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                232&#13;
&amp;#12;                I think the standardization subject comes up. I would say that whatâ&#128;&#153;s happened is that&#13;
&#13;
                we are trying to manage an enormous degree of complexity in order to make it possible&#13;
&#13;
                for people to do work more effectively, more productively. People have attempted to&#13;
&#13;
                measure it. They seem to believe that all of this technology has had some impact on&#13;
&#13;
                productivity, that the Bank is able to do things that it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t able to do then. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
                speculated on that as we have gone through and talked about the ways people use&#13;
&#13;
                technology, interacting with country offices, country dialogue, the extent to which&#13;
&#13;
                people are able to sit at their desk and do analysis that they couldnâ&#128;&#153;t possibly have done&#13;
&#13;
                before. There are both good and bad effects of this. We tend to nowadays rewrite&#13;
&#13;
                reports 80 times instead of seven times. We tend to debate things endlessly at all levels&#13;
&#13;
                of the organization through electronic mail. We tend to spend so much more of our&#13;
&#13;
                time reading mail and there are all kinds of ways like that where technology has&#13;
&#13;
                affected the way we do work.&#13;
&#13;
                But at the end of the day the point I wanted to make was that there is a stupendous&#13;
&#13;
                complexity associated with the technical environment that supplies this capability.&#13;
&#13;
                ISGâ&#128;&#153;s job is to try to manage that complexity in such a way that it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t touch the&#13;
&#13;
                lives of the ordinary Bank staff member any more than necessary. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve managed to&#13;
&#13;
                standardize the technology environment that we supply to people and use that&#13;
&#13;
                standardization as a way to reduce the complexities that they have to deal with when&#13;
&#13;
                they travel in groups into a developing country and try to conduct some appraisal&#13;
&#13;
                mission and they all sit in the hotel room at night and try to exchange information with&#13;
&#13;
                one another and their computers. I think theyâ&#128;&#153;re able to do that better than they were&#13;
&#13;
                able to do it seven or eight years ago despite the fact that the complexity of tools that&#13;
&#13;
                they are employing is a lot higher. So, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               233&#13;
&amp;#12;                As a way of summing up, this stands out to me as a key factor in looking at whatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                evolved over this 25-year span is the extent to which technology is a part of the doing of&#13;
&#13;
                work, the complexity of that technology and the success at masking that technology.&#13;
&#13;
                We had a whole department focused on trying to manage one computer in 1971. That&#13;
&#13;
                one computer was, as Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said over and over again, was not sophisticated or complex.&#13;
&#13;
                And now we supply, depending on what you count, certainly thousands, tens of&#13;
&#13;
                thousands of computers. All of which are incredibly complex by those standards. And&#13;
&#13;
                yet the organization has managed to adapt to that. And has grown to depend upon it.&#13;
&#13;
                Completely.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      My next question is about the World Bank Presidents, and you have already touched&#13;
&#13;
                upon Mr. Wolfensohn a great deal and his role in moving technology in the Bank, but, I&#13;
&#13;
                will, nevertheless, still ask it. Having had long and distinguished careers in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
                you also had the opportunity to work under many different World Bank Presidents.&#13;
&#13;
                Who would you consider to have been, generally speaking, the most effective? Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been five Presidents: McNamara, Clausen, Conable, Preston and Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
                It depends on what your criteria for effectiveness is. Mr. McNamara clearly grew the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank and made it a major player in the development game and actually changed what&#13;
&#13;
                the development game was. It was infrastructure before I think he arrived on the scene.&#13;
&#13;
                He brought it into social sectors and did a whole bunch of things. So the effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
                in terms of bringing the organization to a level where it had played a greater role, I think&#13;
&#13;
                he was there. Conable, Clausen, less so. Mr. Conable, of course, presiding over the&#13;
&#13;
                reorganization, which was a major trauma for the organization. Mr. Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s period&#13;
&#13;
                was when we started to face the issues in the early- and mid-â&#128;&#153;80s of the changes in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                234&#13;
&amp;#12;                nature of lending of the organization and where growth became more difficult. Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Preston, I think actually started the transformation and renewal of the Bank. But,&#13;
&#13;
                because of his death that was not carried forth.          But I think he started the&#13;
&#13;
                transformation. Mr. Wolfensohn, I guess as we talked before, from an effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
                standpoint, I think Mr. Wolfensohn has been extremely effective with external â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      â&#128;¦image of the Bank â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       â&#128;¦external relations and image of the Bank, with the external partnerships, with the&#13;
&#13;
                recognition of the importance of these relationships. I think he has taken on the issues&#13;
&#13;
                of corruption, which were not openly discussed, in prior administrations. I think his&#13;
&#13;
                interest in technology has clearly fostered a relationship with ISG and Mohamed that&#13;
&#13;
                has allowed information technology and communications to move more from the&#13;
&#13;
                periphery into the mainstream, into the center.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Your personal opinion in assessing each one is good enough, and you have covered all&#13;
&#13;
                five of them.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       OK.&#13;
&#13;
Ms Zenni:       Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I have some of the same feelings George has. My opinions of this are also tempered by&#13;
&#13;
                one factor which may not be quite so much the case with George. In the early years of&#13;
&#13;
                my time at the Bank, I was a very focused technical guy, down in the bits and the bytes.&#13;
&#13;
                I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t care less what was going on, on the topic of the President. I wonâ&#128;&#153;t say that I&#13;
&#13;
                was so far removed from it that I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know who the President of the Bank was. But&#13;
&#13;
                now that being said, my own perceptions are I have no experience at the Bank before&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. McNamara but I believe his role in expanding the Bank and changing it and his&#13;
&#13;
                focus on analytics had a lot to do with the growth not only of the Bank but of CAD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              235&#13;
&amp;#12;                (Computing Activities Department). The creating of computing capacity and all of that&#13;
&#13;
                stuff. So, I think that was very important. I was not perhaps in a position to be able to&#13;
&#13;
                evaluate so well Mr. Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s contributions. However, speaking just as a guy who was&#13;
&#13;
                observing and listening in the hallways, the general perception, I think, was that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Clausenâ&#128;&#153;s Presidency was not the most effective. Mr. Conable came at a time when I&#13;
&#13;
                had become part of the management team so I was more directly affected by the&#13;
&#13;
                changes in policies. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure Mr. Conable hates the fact that heâ&#128;&#153;s most remembered for&#13;
&#13;
                the reorganization. By and large I thought one of the things that he did that contributed&#13;
&#13;
                to change in the Bank was this interchanging of these two key Senior Vice Presidents&#13;
&#13;
                and shaking the place up a bit. But I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the sense of great motion during that&#13;
&#13;
                time. I think a lot of energy was on introspection.&#13;
&#13;
                I had very high regard for Mr. Preston. I really thought he was a great leader. He was&#13;
&#13;
                very inspiring to me and I think as George said that I credit him also with wanting to&#13;
&#13;
                change the Bank and I think there was a fair amount of trust in Mr. Preston and I may&#13;
&#13;
                be just projecting onto other people, but those are feelings that I had. I liked him a lot.&#13;
&#13;
                If you ask me who has been most effective, of course I have to judge the world through&#13;
&#13;
                the technology eyes.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Yes, absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       And so thereâ&#128;&#153;s no question that Jim Wolfensohn has had more effect on the technology.&#13;
&#13;
                Also, I think that he has had more of a transformational effect than any President that&#13;
&#13;
                Iâ&#128;&#153;ve ever seen. He has a lot of ideas, he has a lot of personal charisma; he has&#13;
&#13;
                boundless optimism for our abilities to do things. Heâ&#128;&#153;s never seen a problem that he&#13;
&#13;
                doesnâ&#128;&#153;t think the World Bank could solve. And should solve. If I have a criticism of&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Wolfensohn it is exactly the same thing I think that is his strength.      He has this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                236&#13;
&amp;#12;                great capacity to see problems he thinks the Bank can solve and he goes after all of&#13;
&#13;
                them. And so this knock that he constantly gets from the staff of the Bank is that he&#13;
&#13;
                canâ&#128;&#153;t focus on some particular area, that we donâ&#128;&#153;t have a corporate strategy, that our&#13;
&#13;
                strategy is to do everything. As our friend Giles Hopkins says, the essence of strategy is&#13;
&#13;
                deciding what you want to do or won't do. In my experience this is not a strength of&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Wolfensohn. But after all is said and done, I think he has been a transformational&#13;
&#13;
                leader and I revere what he has done. Also, as George said, I donâ&#128;&#153;t think he enjoys the&#13;
&#13;
                trust that Mr. Preston had, partly because he is mercurial, partly because he has a strong&#13;
&#13;
                temper, partly because he has, with the greatest of respect, a big ego. I have always had&#13;
&#13;
                the impression that Mr. Wolfensohn is partly motivated by his strong feelings about&#13;
&#13;
                what he wants to achieve. Part of that has to do with how I think with how Mr.&#13;
&#13;
                Wolfensohn himself will appear in history books.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      The legacy part.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes. And I think he sees a problem in a global warming or something and he thinks the&#13;
&#13;
                World Bank should go and try to solve that problem because we have this fabulous&#13;
&#13;
                capability for solving problems. And I canâ&#128;&#153;t help but think that occasionally in the back&#13;
&#13;
                of his mind that you know heâ&#128;&#153;d like to be the guy who solves this big problem. Pick a&#13;
&#13;
                big problem; heâ&#128;&#153;d like to be the guy to solve it! And you know this is not all bad. I&#13;
&#13;
                think the world needs people like that and the World Bank needs a leader like that. But&#13;
&#13;
                he does come in for some complaining among the staff.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      O.K. Having had the opportunity to work with many different staff, in your opinion,&#13;
&#13;
                who stands out as having made significant contributions in handling technology and&#13;
&#13;
                information technology at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       George West [laughs] .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               237&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       And Dee Buck.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Well, my short answer that if we come down to one person, the person who stands out&#13;
&#13;
                the most is Mohamed. I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s extremely interesting because Mohamed is not a&#13;
&#13;
                technologist.    Heâ&#128;&#153;s a person who has seen what needed to be done from an&#13;
&#13;
                organizational standpoint and mobilized the technology staff to meet that need and he is&#13;
&#13;
                continuing to do it. So, I would say that in my mind Mohamed clearly is the person that&#13;
&#13;
                stands out in this area.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I want to name a couple names. Of course, I agree with George about Mohamed,&#13;
&#13;
                transforming ISG and earning this credibility and focusing on delivering and all that&#13;
&#13;
                sort of stuff. I canâ&#128;&#153;t say enough about Mohamed. I regard him as a mentor, and friend&#13;
&#13;
                and he certainly is at the head of my list.   But there are some other people I want to&#13;
&#13;
                mention. I think Harinder Kohli deserves a lot of credit for recognizing that we needed&#13;
&#13;
                to turn the attention of the IT organization from its classical focus on the finance and&#13;
&#13;
                economics aspects of the Bank where computers historically have a lot of role in&#13;
&#13;
                solving operational problems and recognizing that â&#128;&#147; we still arenâ&#128;&#153;t there, but I mean, at&#13;
&#13;
                least recognizing â&#128;&#147; that the Bank is in a position to do development. Another person&#13;
&#13;
                that I want to look back on and comment about is Peter Hsueh. I donâ&#128;&#153;t even know that&#13;
&#13;
                weâ&#128;&#153;ve talked about Peter Hsueh.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we have.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I think that heâ&#128;&#153;s a guy who did a lot of good while he was here. I was going to mention&#13;
&#13;
                some people but a lot of people that I was about to mention are people learned their&#13;
&#13;
                craft at the knee of Peter Hsueh. I think Le Vu is very much shaped by Peter Hsueh as&#13;
&#13;
                was Ben Hu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              238&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      What did Peter Hsueh . . .?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       He came here from RCA in 1972, I think. Did a stint in the Sulfur Software Group, did&#13;
&#13;
                a stint in the User Services working for George, then was assigned to start up the IBM&#13;
&#13;
                Facilities Center which he did. There was a vacuum and he moved over and took on in&#13;
&#13;
                addition what was the Office Systems area for a while.           Then he took over the&#13;
&#13;
                Communications Division at the time of the reorganization. And took on the telephones&#13;
&#13;
                and solved all those problems. He was at the helm of Communications when we began&#13;
&#13;
                to build the Global Network and actually was instrumental in the first couple of satellite&#13;
&#13;
                links that we got before the major push that Mohamed brought. In Peterâ&#128;&#153;s day, we were&#13;
&#13;
                only able to afford to cherry-pick the big offices where we could offset a lot of the voice&#13;
&#13;
                telephone expense. But, nevertheless the very first piece that we first put in which I&#13;
&#13;
                think was in Ghana I think was on Peterâ&#128;&#153;s watch. Subsequently Peter, I think, became&#13;
&#13;
                kind of the leader of ITS, the ITS part of OBP for a while until Mohamed came. And&#13;
&#13;
                Peter left shortly after Mohamed came. During the time he was here, he had a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                effect. And I think he taught a lot people a lot of things. So, I think heâ&#128;&#153;s somebody that&#13;
&#13;
                needs to be mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Very effective in use of the chargeback.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true. People like Ben Hu and Le Vu, learned a lot from Peter Hsueh about&#13;
&#13;
                how to operate in a chargeback environment.          Who else do I want to mention?&#13;
&#13;
                Actually, I think I want to mention Flavia Fonseca. I think that she didnâ&#128;&#153;t come in here&#13;
&#13;
                initially at a very senior level and yet, as we mentioned in the third interview, I think&#13;
&#13;
                she brought a vision about the way in which we needed to merge the information and&#13;
&#13;
                technology together and a way in which the Bank ought to try to solve some of its&#13;
&#13;
                information problems. She brought that vision and she worked at that vision all the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                239&#13;
&amp;#12;                time she was here under a whole succession of different bosses. And it always felt to&#13;
&#13;
                me that no matter who you put in charge of Flavia, and told them that your job was to&#13;
&#13;
                manage Flavia, Flavia, managed whoever was her boss. And continued to make&#13;
&#13;
                progress on her agenda, and I think she deserves a lot of credit.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Now we get to the very personal questions. What do you see as your contribution to the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank? Mr. West?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       OK. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve worked in multiple parts of the Bank. And I feel good about a number of&#13;
&#13;
                things. I think working in the early part of my career in the-then Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
                Department; I guess it was IRMD at the point in time that I left. I think that this was a&#13;
&#13;
                kind of a formative period for the Computing Activities Department. This was not all&#13;
&#13;
                sweetness and light. This was a hard period of time where I think Merv Muller, who&#13;
&#13;
                had been with IBM and at the University of Wisconsin, was brought in as an outside&#13;
&#13;
                computing professional and formed a professional computing organization in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                So I think that that period of time, when I worked in the then-Computing Activities&#13;
&#13;
                Department, was a case of trying to work with various parts of the user community and&#13;
&#13;
                a number of advances were made.&#13;
&#13;
                I think I brought computer-generated microfiche into the Bank. That was something the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank had not seen before so I think in that area I made a contribution. I think my time&#13;
&#13;
                in Operations, both as a program coordinator and as the Resident Representative of Sri&#13;
&#13;
                Lanka, was a good period of time for me, actually working in Operations. Working at&#13;
&#13;
                the time of the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in Sri Lanka where I was stationed and&#13;
&#13;
                helping to utilize the funds mobilized for reconstruction of Sri Lanka afterwards was a&#13;
&#13;
                period where I felt I played a role in helping both the Bank and the country in its efforts.&#13;
&#13;
                They still have some problems there; all their problems are not solved. When I worked&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                240&#13;
&amp;#12;                in Finance I worked with the Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s Department. I was there when Jules Muis&#13;
&#13;
                entered. I actually drafted his first letter of representation, which the Bank had never&#13;
&#13;
                seen before.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Heâ&#128;&#153;s very proud of that.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I understand from someone I talked to that heâ&#128;&#153;s doing the same thing in his new&#13;
&#13;
                organization.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Yes, in the European Union.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Yes, so working in Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s with Steven Eccles, I worked on Trust Funds, trying to&#13;
&#13;
                bring Trust Funds together. At least in the early â&#128;&#153;90s, I felt I contributed to the&#13;
&#13;
                organization.     The work on Financial Information Systems included actually&#13;
&#13;
                centralizing the information technology function within the Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s organization.&#13;
&#13;
                The IMIS system started prior to my work in the Planning and Budgeting Department&#13;
&#13;
                but it actually came to be used, I think, quite effectively within the Planning and&#13;
&#13;
                Budgeting area when I was there; this is now the Corporate Resource Management&#13;
&#13;
                department. I was a part of the team that put that introduced Dollar Budgeting into the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      That was in â&#128;&#153;93 wasnâ&#128;&#153;t it?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       That was in â&#128;&#153;93. I also had a period of time in which I was a part of the team that&#13;
&#13;
                revised the compensation system for the Bank, back in â&#128;&#153;89. So, that was a six-month&#13;
&#13;
                assignment but a fairly intense one and I felt like we improved the compensation system&#13;
&#13;
                at that point in time. Oh, I also worked on financial controls. I worked on the initial&#13;
&#13;
                introduction of COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) into the Bank, another&#13;
&#13;
                of Julesâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives. I was responsible for supervising an organization that dealt with&#13;
&#13;
                financial controls and we developed the methodology for control self-assessment that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              241&#13;
&amp;#12;                was introduced as part of COSO by CTR (Controllers). This is where I worked. And&#13;
&#13;
                then coming back into ISG in 1996. I was a part of the CIO front office team that&#13;
&#13;
                existed in the early days of ISG. This was prior to the appointment of Mohamed as the&#13;
&#13;
                CIO. I worked with Dee and Giles Hopkins and we were a core unit â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;brain trustâ&#128;? is&#13;
&#13;
                not the right word â&#128;&#147; but we were least a support group for bringing together some of the&#13;
&#13;
                ideas that became the strategy for ISG. Regarding work on global communications, we&#13;
&#13;
                had had a couple satellite links that Dee had mentioned just earlier. I think the DAMA&#13;
&#13;
                (Demand Assigned Multiple Access) link was there but we didnâ&#128;&#153;t actually have broad-&#13;
&#13;
                based support. The Africa Region was the major client and the reluctant dragon was the&#13;
&#13;
                Latin America Region because the satellite footprint sat over both of those regions. I&#13;
&#13;
                worked with the communications team, Le Vu, Vili Brajovic, Gyanchander Gongireddy&#13;
&#13;
                and Hajrudin Beca, to bring this forward and actually get the first DAMA satellite links&#13;
&#13;
                into Africa. I helped not just from the technology side but also worked with the Region&#13;
&#13;
                and that project was expanded from creating a satellite link to also upgrading each of&#13;
&#13;
                the offices to the then-Enterprise Network 2.5 base with new desktops, new local area&#13;
&#13;
                network servers and the like. Oh, you can throw in Y2K for ISG; I headed that effort.&#13;
&#13;
                So I think there are a lot of things that I feel very good about having worked on and&#13;
&#13;
                contributed to in the 28-Â½ years that I spent at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck, what do you see as your contribution to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I have a much less rich and varied career than George. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been pretty much in the&#13;
&#13;
                central IS organization for the whole of my career at the Bank and the first part of it was&#13;
&#13;
                principally technical. In actual fact, I am personally proud of some of the things that&#13;
&#13;
                happened in that time. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that in terms of the degree of its contribution to&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank that it deserves much mention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                                242&#13;
&amp;#12;Ms. Zenni:      It certainly doesnâ&#128;&#153;t minimize the importance of the work.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Well, if youâ&#128;&#153;re a technical guy, you take great joy in doing work which is of good&#13;
&#13;
                quality and yet the long run effect on the Bank was not that large.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure I share that assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       But letâ&#128;&#153;s move on. I really only want to touch on two or three main points. One is the&#13;
&#13;
                work on the Enterprise Network. I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been associated with the Enterprise&#13;
&#13;
                Network (EN) from the first time that phrase was used, right through to the present.&#13;
&#13;
                There was one stretch when I was outside the central department and during the time&#13;
&#13;
                that it was first being rolled out but I think that I may safely lay claim to having had a&#13;
&#13;
                lot of effect on this piece of the technology infrastructure. I think that I may safely&#13;
&#13;
                claim to have managed the initial engineering of it and the laying down of the technical&#13;
&#13;
                framework, the infrastructure thatâ&#128;&#153;s all in the background. Not to say I did all the&#13;
&#13;
                technical work. There were a lot of brilliant technical people working with me on this&#13;
&#13;
                and yet I feel some responsibility for that and I take a great deal of pride in that. One&#13;
&#13;
                small aspect of that which Iâ&#128;&#153;ll mention is I will always feel good about being the guy&#13;
&#13;
                who put the World Bank on the Internet, who took the decision and signed the paper&#13;
&#13;
                and took the risk. So I think the EN is, for me, one of the big things that Iâ&#128;&#153;ll remember&#13;
&#13;
                about my time at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                The second area, desktop reform is very much related to the EN. This was a project that&#13;
&#13;
                was three or four years in the doing to heavily standardize the desktop environment,&#13;
&#13;
                replace all the computers, get them all up to spec, get them installed with the EN and all&#13;
&#13;
                that kind of stuff, worldwide. And I feel much more in this area as if I was a manager&#13;
&#13;
                charged with the execution of a product, of a project, which I felt in the end was done&#13;
&#13;
                reasonably well. In the case of the EN, I felt as though I was kind of more in the role of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                               243&#13;
&amp;#12;                the intellectual leader. In the case of the desktop reform, I donâ&#128;&#153;t claim that role for&#13;
&#13;
                myself. Actually, I donâ&#128;&#153;t claim it for the EN, either. But desktop reform actually grew&#13;
&#13;
                out of some work â&#128;&#147; I have to give credit to Karl Jahr for something we call, â&#128;&#156;Karlâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                Fantasyâ&#128;? or â&#128;&#156;Karl Livesâ&#128;? something, what was it?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       I remember the initial discussions with Karl.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember; â&#128;&#156;the dream projectâ&#128;? that was what we were calling it, I think.&#13;
&#13;
                Anyway, he had some ideas and frankly, typical for Karl, they were a little bit over the&#13;
&#13;
                top, but the principal idea here was that a massive standardization, that aspect of it, a&#13;
&#13;
                massive standardization could be a very effective way of our attacking these desktop&#13;
&#13;
                problems. In the end a project grew out of this that we had endorsed by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
                governance mechanisms in â&#128;&#153;97 and set out on this pathway that went all the way up&#13;
&#13;
                until this past January [2001]. The project, over that long period of time, pretty much&#13;
&#13;
                adhered exactly to what we had planned in 1997. The project was delivered pretty&#13;
&#13;
                much right on time, involved tens of millions of dollars over a long period of time and&#13;
&#13;
                Iâ&#128;&#153;m very proud of the way we did desktop reform.&#13;
&#13;
                I am proud of the role that I had in the formative time that George mentioned, from the&#13;
&#13;
                time that ITS was formed through the creation of the CIO and the work we did in trying&#13;
&#13;
                to set that organization up and get it moving and establish a strategy. I have to give&#13;
&#13;
                credit to other people â&#128;&#147; Giles Hopkins, in particular, I think â&#128;&#147; for articulating this&#13;
&#13;
                strategy that we all talked about among ourselves about how to set the right set of&#13;
&#13;
                directions for this new organization. And whatever role I played in that I feel good&#13;
&#13;
                about. I think Iâ&#128;&#153;ll stop there.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      How would you look back on your careers at the Bank, and what has it personally&#13;
&#13;
                meant to you serving such a unique institution?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              244&#13;
&amp;#12;Mr. West:       The Bank has been my career. I mean, I came to the Bank after having worked in the&#13;
&#13;
                private sector for several years. I was in, I think, my early 30s at that point. So the&#13;
&#13;
                Bank really has been my career. I think it did not take long before I was invested, not&#13;
&#13;
                just in the technology part where I entered, but also in the mission of the Bank. I felt&#13;
&#13;
                the indoctrination; I guess this was the introduction courses where people like Gene&#13;
&#13;
                Rotberg talked.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       Everybody remembers Gene Rotberg! [Laughs]&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     I interviewed him a couple years ago.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       This gave me really a good feeling about being a part of this kind of organization. Any&#13;
&#13;
                profession is basically about caring for a set of ongoing concerns. The Bank has given&#13;
&#13;
                me an opportunity to work in multiple areas and address concerns that all organizations&#13;
&#13;
                have. In the end it comes down to people. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity&#13;
&#13;
                to work in an organization with the people that I have worked with such as Dee and the&#13;
&#13;
                others that we have mentioned here. Looking back, 28Â½ years is a very short period of&#13;
&#13;
                time. But itâ&#128;&#153;s been an extraordinary period for me.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Mr. Buck?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       I have bought a house in Arizona and my wife is out there now and I was out there for&#13;
&#13;
                Thanksgiving and we were invited to the neighborâ&#128;&#153;s house for Thanksgiving dinner and&#13;
&#13;
                sat around the table with a bunch of folks. Very nice people who live in a small town in&#13;
&#13;
                a faraway desert, far from the centers of power of the United States. I had a chance&#13;
&#13;
                maybe to talk just a little about what we do here. It made me proud. Iâ&#128;&#153;m glad to have&#13;
&#13;
                been associated with the World Bank. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve come into a time now when the World&#13;
&#13;
                Bank is more in the news and perhaps unfavorably portrayed more frequently than in&#13;
&#13;
                the past and than we would like. I think we were not often in the news before but when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                             245&#13;
&amp;#12;                we were it was generally in a kind of a favorable way. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s not so true anymore&#13;
&#13;
                and so I guess I find myself from time to time in public settings having to explain to&#13;
&#13;
                people what it is that the World Bank does and what it stands for and the kind of an&#13;
&#13;
                organization it is. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always been proud to be part of the Bank. During a stretch in&#13;
&#13;
                the â&#128;&#153;80s when the Bank was grappling with the so-called NRS issues, non-regular staff&#13;
&#13;
                and all of that, I remember one of the questions that came up at one point was earlier on&#13;
&#13;
                the Bank had had a reputation as an organization that rewarded staff quite handsomely.&#13;
&#13;
                We had a generous benefit package and we had at least in the early years, the&#13;
&#13;
                remuneration that the Bank staff got was at least by American standards quite generous.&#13;
&#13;
                But that had kind of eroded over time and by the late â&#128;&#153;80s, we were no longer really&#13;
&#13;
                paying people so much more than what was customary and in particular in the IT area,&#13;
&#13;
                when it was hot. We had a lot of these consultants here who were not really making a&#13;
&#13;
                lot more money than they could make anywhere else. They had no benefits package.&#13;
&#13;
                They had no pension. They had ill-treatment from the Bank and â&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Becker:     No stock options.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Buck:       No stock options, certainly. Although that was more of an issue in the late â&#128;&#153;90s. But,&#13;
&#13;
                the question came up, why do these people stay here? If it used to be that they were&#13;
&#13;
                here because we paid them well. But thatâ&#128;&#153;s not the case anymore. And yet, despite the&#13;
&#13;
                fact that you could say that some of them even feel as though theyâ&#128;&#153;re being abused, they&#13;
&#13;
                continue to want to work here. Of course you have to acknowledge that some part of&#13;
&#13;
                this is just due to human inertia. People get started somewhere and it takes a lot of&#13;
&#13;
                energy to change and move somewhere else. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always thought that one of the things&#13;
&#13;
                that kept people here, particularly in our field, is the opportunity to work with some of&#13;
&#13;
                the brightest people I know. Iâ&#128;&#153;m always struck when I go elsewhere and have a chance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McDonald Buck/George West Oral History Interview                                              246&#13;
&amp;#12;                to contrast the environment of the Bank with other places. Iâ&#128;&#153;m always struck by the&#13;
&#13;
                level of intellectual depth and the richness of the environment here. I think thatâ&#128;&#153;s the&#13;
&#13;
                reason that people stay here and it certainly is one of the big reasons that Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always&#13;
&#13;
                stayed here. It is a challenging environment in many ways. Some good ways and some&#13;
&#13;
                not-so-good ways.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      OK. Is there anything else either of you would like to add?&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Thank you for the opportunity to do this.&#13;
&#13;
Ms. Zenni:      Well, thank you both for a most invaluable contribution to the historical record and the&#13;
&#13;
                Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Oral History program.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. West:       Thank you.&#13;

            William M. Buck and George W. West held on November 7, 9,
            15, 29, and December 4, 2001

        <abstracts>
            In November and December 2001, William
            M. Buck and George W. West were interviewed on behalf of the
            World Bank Group Archives oral history program by William H.
            Becker and Marie T. Zenni. During his tenure at the Bank
            from 1974 to 2001, Mr. Buck worked in the following areas:
            as a systems programmer (1974-1983); as manager in the
            computing technology center (1984-1991) and for the
            enterprise network project (1992-1994); as a business
            process change consultant (1995-1996); as the principal
            information officer and advisor (1996-2000); and as chief
            technology officer (2000-2001). As for Mr. West, his World
            Bank tenure lasted from 1972-2001 and he worked in the
            following areas: as a computer systems specialist
            (1972-1975); in the department of computing activities, user
            services division, as chief (1975-1982); in the South Asia
            regional office as a program coordinator (1982-1987); in Sri
            Lanka as a resident representative (1987-1988); in policy
            planning and research as a systems advisor (1988-1990); in
            the planning and budgeting department, budget policy and
            systems division, as chief (1990-1993); in the office of the
            vice president and controller as an advisor (1993-1996); and
            in the information systems group as an advisor (1996-2001).
            Their transcript concerns a retrospective on the evolution
            of technology at the World Bank, from its fragmented
            information and business systems to its contractors for
            information technology jobs, such as the use of a vendor to
            implement SAP in the late 1990s as a business management
            software solution.
