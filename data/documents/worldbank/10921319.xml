&#13;
The Economic Development Institute (EDI), in partnership with the University of Maryland&#13;
Business School conducted a Core Course on infrastructure finance in Washington, D.C.,&#13;
from June 15-26, 1998. A total of 67 participants from 16 countries attended the course,&#13;
including government officials, private executives, and financiers. The course covered several&#13;
topics, including: strategies for risk mitigation, capital market financing opportunities,&#13;
strategies for project appraisal, cash flow analysis, and legal issues. The methods of&#13;
instruction used were formal presentation, study groups, and simulated case studies.&#13;
&#13;
An evaluation was conducted by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) using an end-of-course&#13;
questionnaire. Fifty-six of the 67 participants (83.6%), completed the evaluation. The&#13;
questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first was a survey of participants' opinions of the&#13;
course content and delivery. Respondents were asked to rate aspects of the course, such as&#13;
relevance, thoroughness, training materials and quality of instruction. The second section&#13;
attempted to gauge the increase of knowledge gained from the course. This was done using&#13;
a set of self-assessment questions. Both sections used a 6-point Likert type scale that&#13;
ranged from 1 = minimum to 6 = maximum.&#13;
&#13;
Respondents had varied educational levels and professional backgrounds. They held either&#13;
Ph.D.s (14 of 56 respondents), MBAs (12), Masters other than MBAs (15) or Bachelors (11).&#13;
Two-thirds of respondents worked in the public sector and one-third worked in the private&#13;
sector. Thirty-three of the respondents had less than 5 years experience in infrastructure and&#13;
finance and/or development. Fourteen had between 5 and 15 years experience and 8&#13;
respondents had over 15 years experience. Ten of the 54 respondents were women. Results&#13;
from the evaluation are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  One aspect of the course received especially favorable responses. The question&#13;
        asked if the course provided participants with new information. Sixty-nine percent&#13;
        (N=55) of respondents indicated that this aspect of the course fulfilled or exceeded&#13;
        their expectations. The mean score for this item was 4.87, which was the highest&#13;
        mean of the evaluation. However, written comments revealed that a few topics were&#13;
        considered too theoretical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  One specific indicator received a relatively high average mean score (mean=4.64).&#13;
        This item addressed the selection of readings and supporting materials. Trainers may&#13;
        wish to use the same or similar materials again in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  One noted weakness was the depth of the course content. Respondents gave this&#13;
        criteria a mean score of 4.17, the lowest recorded. This would indicate that&#13;
        participants may benefit from additional course time, or from a more advanced&#13;
        starting point for the course.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lTwo lower than average scores were observed that related to course delivery. One was&#13;
 on the usefulness of the practice exercises (mean=4.24) and the other was the&#13;
 degree to which trainers communicated their messages well (mean=4.28). When&#13;
 looking for areas to improve this course, organizers may focus on these two aspects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe evaluation highlighted a notable difference between the responses from Bachelor&#13;
 degree holders and Ph.D. holders on the question, "Was this course a worthwhile use&#13;
 of your time?". For respondents with Bachelor degrees (N=11), the average mean&#13;
 score was 4.36, while for Ph.D. holders (N=14), the average mean score was 4.93.&#13;
 Considering the specific needs of participants with Bachelor degrees, or changing to a&#13;
 more narrowly focused target audience may improve overall satisfaction rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lPre/post course mean scores were used to estimate participants' knowledge of&#13;
 selected topics before and after the course. The largest gain in perceived knowledge&#13;
 was in "the ability to appreciate the importance of clear systems of risk identification&#13;
 and allocation". This item had a pre-course mean of 3.33 and a post-course mean of&#13;
 5.25. The gain was 1.93, or 57.9 percent. Written comments also suggested a high&#13;
 degree of satisfaction with the instructor of this topic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThere were some limitations to this evaluation. First, the design of the pre/post self-&#13;
 assessment measures only the perceived level of knowledge at either time. It does&#13;
 not measure the actual level of knowledge gain. For this, a pre/post course cognitive&#13;
 test must be done. Also, this evaluation only captures the respondents' reactions&#13;
 upon completion of the course. Some time after the course, when attempts are made&#13;
 to put the lessons learned into practice, respondents' opinions may change.&#13;

            The Economic Development Institute
            (EDI), in partnership with the University of Maryland
            Business School conducted a core course on infrastructure
            finance in Washington, D.C., from June 15-26, 1998. A total
            of 67 participants from 16 countries attended the course,
            including government officials, private executives, and
