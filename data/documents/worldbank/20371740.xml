Strengthening Networks: Using Organizational Network&#13;
Analysis to Promote Network Effectiveness, Scale,&#13;
and Accountability&#13;

   Networks are emerging as an important delivery mechanism for sustainable development; however, reli-&#13;
   able network diagnostics are necessary to ensuring accountability and quality to donors and stakehold-&#13;
   ers and to monitoring, evaluating, and learning from networks. In this brief, the authors examine cur-&#13;
   rent practice around networks for development. They describe â&#128;&#156;organizational network analysis,â&#128;&#157; a tool&#13;
   applied by Pactâ&#128;&#153;s Capacity Building Services Group1 in multiple international settings, which can help&#13;
   identify opportunities and improve network effectiveness. The authors conclude by emphasizing that a&#13;
   networked approach can provide innovative solutions to todayâ&#128;&#153;s development challenges.&#13;

  Around the world, donors and nongovernmental             costs, risks, and benefits associated with network sup-&#13;

&amp;#12;  Types of Networks&#13;
&#13;
  Many networks defy easy categorization, as they tend to fulfill multiple roles. The ambiguity of the term â&#128;&#156;networkâ&#128;&#157; makes it dif-&#13;
  ficult to pin down its precise meaning. It could mean friends, large organizations, routers along the backbone of the Internet, or&#13;
  as network researcher Duncan Watts points out, neurons firing in the brain. Here is a list of network types of particular interest&#13;
  to capacity building for development:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Representative networks are the most formal type of network associated with WBI work. These are often legally recognized,&#13;
     bounded groups of similar organizations or individuals that coordinate to take advantage of scale. Examples of representative&#13;
     networks include chambers of commerce, InterAction, and the American Medical Association.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Action networks are groups of organizations and/or individuals that coordinate in order to achieve a strategic goalâ&#128;&#148;be it to&#13;
     scale up learning, providen services, or advocate on a policy issue. Action networks often include diverse groups of organiza-&#13;
     tions and/or individuals. Examples of action networks include the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability (ANSA)-Africa,&#13;
     Net Impact, and the Impact Alliance.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Knowledge exchange and social networks are the most informal type of network for capacity development. These networks are&#13;
     primarily trust based and are intended to increase an individualâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;social capitalâ&#128;&#157; by facilitating connections, diffusing infor-&#13;
     mation, and increasing knowledge. Examples of knowledge exchange and social networks include Knowledge Management for&#13;
     Development (KM4D), Linked-In, Facebook, and the WBI Alumni Group.&#13;

working through networks without realizing it. Others                 organizations or individuals) and links (flows of col-&#13;

agers and their program constituents aware of what                    deeper information about interactions across networks&#13;
constitutes a network (see box).                                      and about key actors within networks. These include&#13;

            Networks are emerging as an important
            delivery mechanism for sustainable development; however,
            reliable network diagnostics are necessary to ensuring
            accountability and quality to donors and stakeholders and to
            monitoring, evaluating, and learning from networks. In this
            brief, the authors examine current practice around networks
            for development. They describe &#145;organizational network
            analysis,&#146; a tool applied by pact&#146;s capacity building
            services group in multiple international settings, which can
            help identify opportunities and improve network
            effectiveness. The authors conclude by emphasizing that a
            networked approach can provide innovative solutions to
            today&#146;s development challenges.
