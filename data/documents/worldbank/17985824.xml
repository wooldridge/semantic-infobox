&amp;#12;                   Interview with Ernest Stern&#13;
                          The World Bank&#13;
                         January 5, 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did Operations look to you when you first came in?&#13;
&#13;
You must have identified your strong and weak areas.&#13;
&#13;
A:   You attribute more rationality to these processes than&#13;
&#13;
actually exists. And it was a long time ago.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's what historians do.    We impose rationality on a&#13;
&#13;
chaotic universe. Why don't you just kind of walk us through&#13;
&#13;
a little bit.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I would be misleading you if I tried to lead you through&#13;
&#13;
this in any kind of systematic fashion.      Of course I knew how&#13;
&#13;
the office operated, but only quite generally.      I had been a&#13;
&#13;
Regional Vice President for less than two years.&#13;
&#13;
     If I can characterize what I did, I would say I&#13;
&#13;
transformed the office from a quality-control center into a&#13;
&#13;
chief operating officer's office. We tried to develop the&#13;
&#13;
Vice Presidents into a management team for Operations, which&#13;
&#13;
was concerned with the whole gamut of operations issues from&#13;
&#13;
career development and personnel issues to budget, to&#13;
&#13;
relations to reseach and policy formulation and to the&#13;
&#13;
systemic issues in operations themseÂ·lves.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   From an Operations point of view, you must have roughly&#13;
&#13;
prioritized the problems in your mind.    To be an operational&#13;
&#13;
officer you have to have a sense of what you need to do&#13;
&#13;
immediately.    Now, you had a pretty good view of that.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 2&#13;
Earlier, you mentioned that there was some mushiness out&#13;
&#13;
there in the organization as far as the loan policy was&#13;
&#13;
concerned.&#13;
&#13;
A:   There was a lot of mushiness out there.   But I can't&#13;
&#13;
tell you which of a dozen possible subjects at the time we&#13;
&#13;
took in any order of priority. The office continued to&#13;
&#13;
provide a review function for projects going to the Board but&#13;
&#13;
the focus shifted from procedural to substantive issues. We&#13;
&#13;
tried to strengthen and systematize the operational&#13;
&#13;
framework. We tried to improve the forecasting of&#13;
&#13;
disbursements by developing disbursement profiles by sector&#13;
&#13;
and country based on actual experience so that estimates of&#13;
&#13;
disbursements -- which influenced our borrowing requirement&#13;
&#13;
and our liqudity position -- were not simply somebody's&#13;
&#13;
wishful thinking but we were never able to break project&#13;
&#13;
staff of their excessive optimism. Invariably, they argued&#13;
&#13;
that this particular project would defy all past experience.&#13;
&#13;
We tried to get the managers to focus on supervision and&#13;
&#13;
implementation problems by holding regular problem project&#13;
&#13;
reviews and requiring managers to be more systematic in&#13;
&#13;
correcting project problems identified in their portfolios.&#13;
&#13;
In a related area, we focused on the serious deficiencies of&#13;
&#13;
our borrowers to comply with audit covenants under loan&#13;
&#13;
agreements. That led to proposals   (not very well executed I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 3&#13;
&#13;
must say) for strengthening audit training and the auditing&#13;
&#13;
profession in the member countries, which had been identified&#13;
&#13;
as a major cause of the problem.&#13;
&#13;
     We tried to streamline the procurement process by&#13;
&#13;
raising limits, which had not been raised for a long time,&#13;
&#13;
below which simplified procedures could apply.    We also&#13;
&#13;
introduced the Statement of Expenditures and Revolving&#13;
&#13;
Accounts, designed to accelerate disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
     There was a lot of housekeeping to be done on the&#13;
&#13;
operational side. The Bank had grown very rapidly and not&#13;
&#13;
much attention had been paid to either systems or management.&#13;
&#13;
I thought it was timely to consolidate and to devote more&#13;
&#13;
attention to common understandings of and response to&#13;
&#13;
problems; to strengthen the management of operations instead&#13;
&#13;
of treating the problem of each unit, or each project, as&#13;
&#13;
unique.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank's personnel system also was very weak and there&#13;
&#13;
was limited senior management support for improvements. With&#13;
&#13;
the very active support of the VP Personnel and&#13;
&#13;
Administration, we initiated improved practices in&#13;
&#13;
Operations, some of which later became Bankwide. We&#13;
&#13;
introduced regular meetings with the Operations Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents to discuss staff performance and identify&#13;
&#13;
candidates for promotion. We also jointly reviewed annual&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 4&#13;
merit increases and regularly selected staff and managers for&#13;
&#13;
rotation. We developed unit based training systems which was&#13;
&#13;
a rather neglected area in the Bank. But we did not make&#13;
&#13;
adequate progress in this. I introduced the first Operations&#13;
&#13;
wide senior management Retreat. The first couple were a&#13;
&#13;
little stiff, because they were new to the group and in fact&#13;
&#13;
a good number of people did not know each other well, but&#13;
&#13;
they came to be well accepted and helped to foster a team&#13;
&#13;
spirit. In true Bank fashion "Retreats" quickly became very&#13;
&#13;
popular at every level of management, until Mr. Conable, who&#13;
&#13;
expressed doubts about their utility, objected to the cost of&#13;
&#13;
holding retreats off-site.&#13;
&#13;
     On the management side, we also made great strides in&#13;
&#13;
the area of budgeting. Even within the constraints of an&#13;
&#13;
excessively complex and distorted budget system, we greatly&#13;
&#13;
simplified the process and reduced the burden on staff.&#13;
&#13;
     I don't know whether you know the details of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
budget process but we used to keep accounts in units called&#13;
&#13;
"staff weeks." Nobody knew what the monetary value of a staff&#13;
&#13;
week was since there was no differentiation between a staff&#13;
&#13;
week of the most junior professional and the most senior. But&#13;
&#13;
it was a unit of measurement, and all associated costs were&#13;
&#13;
described as ratios to the staffweeks, e.g. a travel ratio, a&#13;
&#13;
secretarial support ratio etc. Immense amounts of time, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 5&#13;
&#13;
emotions, used to be spent on arguing about these "cost&#13;
&#13;
coefficients." It was the most arid exercise imaginable&#13;
&#13;
because the data did not reflect costs; they were not&#13;
&#13;
controllable by managers; and there were no benchmarks of&#13;
&#13;
"normal" costs. I soon stopped taking the system too&#13;
&#13;
seriously and refused, at the Operations level, to discuss&#13;
&#13;
budgets or work programs in terms of these cost coefficients.&#13;
&#13;
I told the President to allocate whatever budget he, on the&#13;
&#13;
advice of the Budget office, thought was appropriate for&#13;
&#13;
Operations and I would allocate it among the Regions and OPS.&#13;
&#13;
I promised, in return, that he would never get a budget&#13;
&#13;
appeal from me or any of my units, and that Operations always&#13;
&#13;
would submit its final budget proposal within the approved&#13;
&#13;
guidelines. Mr.Clausen was receptive to this approach. In&#13;
&#13;
turn, the Operations Vice Presidents received their&#13;
&#13;
allocation (but this was in dollars, not staff years) based&#13;
&#13;
on work done by my budget officer (Mr. Ruddy) and asked to&#13;
&#13;
return with their work programs. This saved a lot of time&#13;
&#13;
compared to the approach of having everyone submit their work&#13;
&#13;
proposals without guidance on budget totals and then have to&#13;
&#13;
argue the total down with every line manager subsequently. As&#13;
&#13;
a result we were able to avoid lengthy budget discussions&#13;
&#13;
that took place in other parts of the Bank. If adjustments to&#13;
&#13;
the budget envelopes were needed, they were made based on&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 6&#13;
past performance and work plans, rather than debating the&#13;
&#13;
magnitude of "staffweek" coefficients or whether somebody&#13;
&#13;
needed another secretary.&#13;
&#13;
     Eventually, the "staff-week" budget system broke down&#13;
&#13;
and the Bank now is on dollar budgeting.   The simplification&#13;
&#13;
of the approach in Operations, did not go far enough, but it&#13;
&#13;
was a step in the right direction. With a central budget&#13;
&#13;
office which was very conservative, and never developed the&#13;
&#13;
details on how a simplified system could work Bank-wide,&#13;
&#13;
there were limits to how far a single unit could go.&#13;
&#13;
     To sum all this up, we tried to introduce modern&#13;
&#13;
management practices in Operations&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This "staff-week" system sounds like a labor theory of&#13;
&#13;
value but&#13;
&#13;
A:   It wasn't even as sensible as that. A staff week, mind&#13;
&#13;
you, was not one week of a person's time. It was one week of&#13;
&#13;
staff time -- regardless of the level of staff involved. if&#13;
&#13;
something cost 10 staff weeks, it could be 10 staff weeks of&#13;
&#13;
a department director, which is X, or 10 staff weeks of the&#13;
&#13;
lowerst research assistants, which could beY. There was&#13;
&#13;
absolutely no way to know. And neither leave nor other&#13;
&#13;
benefits were accounted for. So staff weeks had no cost&#13;
&#13;
equivalence or relevance at the unit level nor did they&#13;
&#13;
reflect skill use.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 7&#13;
Q:   Did that date from the beginning of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.    I believe this was McNamara's contribution. I don't&#13;
&#13;
know if he personally developed it, but it certainly emerged&#13;
&#13;
in his period.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's fascinating. It was the first attempt at any kind&#13;
&#13;
of cost control in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A:   True, but it really didn't control costs. Nobody knew&#13;
&#13;
exactly how much a staff week cost. Anyhow, that's all gone&#13;
&#13;
now but it took a long time to fade. I take some credit for&#13;
&#13;
helping the process along.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you, in effect, imposed a dollar budgeting scheme&#13;
&#13;
while they were still using staff weeks?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. I had to. Although short of a Bank-wide reform, the&#13;
&#13;
two systems co-existed uncomfortably. People used to come in&#13;
&#13;
and argue, "My coefficient for supervision is 9.2 staff&#13;
&#13;
weeks."    I didn't know what to do with thatÂ·.   Am   I supposed&#13;
&#13;
to say that's too much, or too little? Who knows?       The&#13;
&#13;
debates were endless.    There were coefficients for&#13;
&#13;
supervision, travel, project preparation, clerical support. A&#13;
&#13;
lot of people spent a lot of time applying coefficients to&#13;
&#13;
arrive at a dollar figure for the budget. But I was not that&#13;
&#13;
patient since the coefficients were merely historical&#13;
&#13;
relations of dubious relevance and the staff weeks had no&#13;
&#13;
relation to costs.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 8&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So you pushed these administrative details lower in the&#13;
&#13;
hierarchy while you concerned yourself primarily with dollar&#13;
&#13;
allocations.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, basically the Vice Presidents and I decided to&#13;
&#13;
focus on how much output could be produced for a given dollar&#13;
&#13;
budget. Essentially, I said "Here's the budget envelope, now&#13;
&#13;
put together a work program."&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would it be possible to say that you implemented a&#13;
&#13;
program of controls which was consistent with the theory of&#13;
&#13;
the '72 reorganization, because it pushed these things down&#13;
&#13;
further?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes. But even today the process of delegating budget&#13;
&#13;
authority down to the line managers is not yet complete.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's very interesting.    Now, when you implemented a&#13;
&#13;
better control system and a better evaluation system, that&#13;
&#13;
doesn't make everybody happy, does it?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What happened?    What went wrong?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it made some people unhappy. I don't know that&#13;
&#13;
anything went wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Out in the Regions for instance. They must not have been&#13;
&#13;
overjoyed with this?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It varied.   Some Vice Presidents supported these kinds&#13;
&#13;
of changes and the direction of decentralization of details&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 9&#13;
&#13;
while focussing more centrally on the strategic issues.&#13;
&#13;
Others didn't.   We always had a very mixed bag.    There were&#13;
&#13;
some who still saw me as the new boy on the block and a&#13;
&#13;
pain-in-the-neck; there were some who supported it and&#13;
&#13;
participated effectively.     There were also some who believed&#13;
&#13;
in it and tried hard, but didn't do it very well.&#13;
&#13;
     The Bank's Vice Presidents and, indeed, its managers in&#13;
&#13;
general were never selected on the basis of any proven&#13;
&#13;
managerial track record. The person who replaced me in South&#13;
&#13;
Asia, David Hopper, was a very good agricultural economist&#13;
&#13;
but he didn't care much about management. The person who ran&#13;
&#13;
Latin America, Mr. Barletta, who later became President of&#13;
&#13;
Panama, was a very nice person, a good economist and very&#13;
&#13;
knowledgeable about Latin America but, like Hopper,&#13;
&#13;
management was not his strong suit.&#13;
&#13;
     There were others in Operations who welcomed the&#13;
&#13;
delegation of authority and the efforts to standardize and&#13;
&#13;
systematize. For instance, the people who did the financial&#13;
&#13;
planning projections welcomed the standardization of&#13;
&#13;
disbursement profiles.    I also believe that the tightening up&#13;
&#13;
on supervision and follow-up on projects in difficulty,&#13;
&#13;
generally was welcomed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, as an operating officer, what did you do when you&#13;
&#13;
got resistance to this?     What could you do?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Stern (1/5/95), Page 10&#13;
A:   You can't do much beside advocate and persuade because&#13;
&#13;
it's hard to fire people.        I did, in my years at the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
fire two Vice Presidents, but it's difficult at that or any&#13;
&#13;
other level.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As VP for Operations, when did you get a sense that you&#13;
&#13;
had the Operations that you wanted? When did you feel it was&#13;
&#13;
running in a Stern fashion?&#13;
&#13;
A:   You've got to understand what this job was. We are not&#13;
&#13;
the private sector. Corporate culture was weak; corporate&#13;
&#13;
strategy was diffuse; personnel management was very much in a&#13;
&#13;
public sector mode; individual agendas were strong. So&#13;
&#13;
getting cohesion and concensus takes a lot of persuasion, a&#13;
&#13;
lot of education and a lot of constant maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, the channels through which one operates aren't&#13;
&#13;
always effective because you can't talk to the staff directly&#13;
&#13;
on a consistent basis. I had to work through managers who&#13;
&#13;
might or might not be fully convinced, no matter what they&#13;
&#13;
say or don't say in a meeting. It's a slow process. To this&#13;
&#13;
day, the dissemination of management changes is very slow.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gone to full dollar budgeting but there still&#13;
&#13;
are units which budget in staff weeks.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Really?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We now have delegated the budget firmly down to the Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents,    ~or   sure.   It's their budget now; it's their&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 11&#13;
&#13;
business plan.   But there are Vice Presidents who don't&#13;
&#13;
delegate it down any further. They sit on large contingency&#13;
&#13;
funds in their front office and dribble out the budget funds.&#13;
&#13;
That complicates unit management and responsiveness,&#13;
&#13;
frustrates staff and shows a distrust of subordinate&#13;
&#13;
managers.&#13;
&#13;
     It does take a long time to get things done here, but,&#13;
&#13;
by and large, I thought we had made good progress in a number&#13;
&#13;
of areas. We established more explicit discipline associated&#13;
&#13;
with our lending, and a more standardized set of allocation&#13;
&#13;
criteria with a more explicit component for country&#13;
&#13;
performance assessment. We'd improved personnel management.&#13;
&#13;
     Although these accomplishments were notable, the most&#13;
&#13;
interesting development during this period was the growth of&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending. The Bank gradually took a seat at the&#13;
&#13;
policy table and participated in discussions of the general&#13;
&#13;
policy framework.   This was new to the Bank and took a lot of&#13;
&#13;
time. We tried to do it as a team, learn from what happened&#13;
&#13;
in Latin America, South Asia, or Africa.   Mr. McNamara was&#13;
&#13;
very interested in these operations. He also was very much&#13;
&#13;
involved in sector and country allocations, and he reviewed&#13;
&#13;
every project that went to the Board.   No President has done&#13;
&#13;
that since.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you began to tighten the system of control and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Stern (1/5/95), Page 12&#13;
&#13;
evaluation of performance, did information arise that&#13;
&#13;
highlighted problem areas that you had not seen before?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Sure.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of those areas?&#13;
&#13;
A:   For instance, pulling the portfolio supervision reviews&#13;
&#13;
into my office helped to emphasize the importance of&#13;
&#13;
effective implementation. It helped managers to develop&#13;
&#13;
action plans to remedy problems and established a basis for&#13;
&#13;
monitoring the follow-up. It revealed that staff and managers&#13;
&#13;
kn.ew they had bad   projects-~   projects which had received very&#13;
&#13;
poor implementation ratings -- yet hadn't done anything about&#13;
&#13;
them. Project completion dates were extended routinely even&#13;
&#13;
though there were no or little disbursement. We established&#13;
&#13;
operational directives which limited the number of extensions&#13;
&#13;
we could give to loans and gradually cleaned out averaged&#13;
&#13;
loans which were tying up funds which could be used&#13;
&#13;
elsewhere. Poor project design was not readily recognized.&#13;
&#13;
There is great reluctance in the Bank to call a loss a loss.&#13;
&#13;
Very few people feel comfortable saying "this thing just&#13;
&#13;
won't work. Sorry, mistake."&#13;
&#13;
     Shortly thereafter, Lew Preston arrived and he said the&#13;
&#13;
Bank is the most undermanaged institution he had ever seen.&#13;
&#13;
On the whole, I think that's still true. However, in the&#13;
&#13;
earlier period, I think the Bank was woefully undermanaged.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 13&#13;
Q:   Right.    And it was growing rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
A:   And it was growing rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Hmmmm.    The main thrust of the McNamara strategy was on&#13;
&#13;
growth and expansion of the mission.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Aside from policy issues, which we can leave aside for a&#13;
&#13;
moment, the things that surfaced were management strains. The&#13;
&#13;
size of the Bank and the scope of its activity had outgrown&#13;
&#13;
its management practices. Yet management was not seen as an&#13;
&#13;
important internal priority, nor was management ability seen&#13;
&#13;
as an important criterion for promotion. And although Mr.&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was   very interesed in management issues, he relied&#13;
&#13;
heavily on the budget as a management tool. In the best of&#13;
&#13;
systems that is not enough; and we did not have the best of&#13;
&#13;
systems.&#13;
&#13;
     Also, as the volume of business grew, the Board became&#13;
&#13;
increasingly concerned that all countries be treated equally.&#13;
&#13;
There was more emphasis on how Bank policies were applied;&#13;
&#13;
more demand for reviews of individual sectors; more emphasis&#13;
&#13;
on learning through evaluation and dissemination of the&#13;
&#13;
experience.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What was your relationship to the Board at that time?&#13;
&#13;
A:   In the late '70s?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Up to the end of McNamara, let's say.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I think my relation with the Board has always been&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 14&#13;
&#13;
pretty good. In McNamara's time, he dominated      relationships&#13;
&#13;
with the Board. He was rarely away for long and made it his&#13;
&#13;
business to be back for Board meetings whenever possible.&#13;
&#13;
That changed with his successors. As a result, Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents got to chair Board meetings. Also, Board&#13;
&#13;
committees proliferated. So, after McNamara, I got more&#13;
&#13;
directly involved in Board meetings than I had been before,&#13;
&#13;
but I think the relationship was always pretty good.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you talk a little bit now about how that changes&#13;
&#13;
under Clausen? What happens now?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, you have a very different person.     Clausen was not&#13;
&#13;
a fighter like McNamara, he was not as aggressive&#13;
&#13;
substantively or as dominant. Also, he was not as well&#13;
&#13;
connected to the political establishment, the Executive and&#13;
&#13;
the Congressional establishment, as McNamara had been. He&#13;
&#13;
wasn't a Washington insider and, unlike McNamara, he didn't&#13;
&#13;
have a development agenda of his own.      I didn't know McNamara&#13;
&#13;
before he came to the Bank, but I imagine that by the time he&#13;
&#13;
arrived he had a pretty clear idea of what he wanted to do.&#13;
&#13;
That wasn't true with Clausen.     He saw himself more as a&#13;
&#13;
manager, relying on   t~e   Bank's professional staff to develop&#13;
&#13;
substantive issues and proposals. He was much more willing to&#13;
&#13;
let his senior managers do their thing as long as they&#13;
&#13;
consulted with him on major issues.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 15&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What did he tell you when he came on board?        Did you&#13;
&#13;
have a sit-down with him and go over what you were doing?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I don't remember a single comprehensive review session.&#13;
&#13;
In the usual Bank fashion, we had prepared very large&#13;
&#13;
briefing books. No President ever read through them. The new&#13;
&#13;
President was brought up to date gradually on ongoing&#13;
&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, it was also that the Bank was still geared to&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's style.&#13;
&#13;
A:   We did sit down and talk about what Operations was all&#13;
&#13;
about.   I'm sure we went over some of the briefing material.&#13;
&#13;
Early on, Mr. Clausen created a President's Council.       He was&#13;
&#13;
used to a more structured approach to senior management than&#13;
&#13;
McNamara.     McNamara was more selective.   If he wanted to talk&#13;
&#13;
about agriculture, he called three or four people that dealt&#13;
&#13;
directly with that area. Clausen was more hierarchical. He&#13;
&#13;
expected his senior staff to handle most of the details.&#13;
&#13;
     McNamara also had senior management meetings, but those&#13;
&#13;
were not seen as a collegial decision-making body.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.     Everyone knew who made the decisions.&#13;
&#13;
A:   There wasn't any question about that.     Clausen also knew&#13;
&#13;
that he was going to make the final decision, but he was much&#13;
&#13;
more participatory, more influenced by the debates in the&#13;
&#13;
President's Council, and he was very patient. Ultimately&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 16&#13;
though, he had no problem with saying "This is how we are&#13;
&#13;
going to do it."    His management style was just different. He&#13;
&#13;
was more concerned with staff motivation and morale. He&#13;
&#13;
introduced extensive staff surveys to the Bank because he&#13;
&#13;
thought it was important to morale and to help identify&#13;
&#13;
management issues. He wanted to establish a better internal&#13;
&#13;
communications system based on his experience at the Bank of&#13;
&#13;
America.    The World Bank didn't have an internal&#13;
&#13;
communications system.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, you did have one, but it was very informal.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, well, it was the local grapevine. It wasn't a&#13;
&#13;
management initiated communication system.&#13;
&#13;
     Clausen was also interested in some of the management&#13;
&#13;
issues.    He promoted the development of career planning for&#13;
&#13;
future managers, and he expressed serious interest in our&#13;
&#13;
computer technology improvements.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So was he accustomed to having a chief operating officer&#13;
&#13;
so that he could deal with external matters while the chief&#13;
&#13;
operating officer ran things on a day to day basis.&#13;
&#13;
A:   He certainly was very comfortable with the Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidency structure. He had no problem delegating authority&#13;
&#13;
to the senior staff. He expected you to report. He didn't&#13;
&#13;
want to be surprised, but he certainly had no interest into&#13;
&#13;
going into McNamara's depth of detail. But, you should be&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 17&#13;
&#13;
aware that the Senior VP Operations was not the equivalent of&#13;
&#13;
a CEo in a corporation. Not all of the tools needed to serve&#13;
&#13;
the clients were in Operations. Operations was one business&#13;
&#13;
function - the largest and the most important to the&#13;
&#13;
borrowers - but the other functions also reported directly to&#13;
&#13;
the President.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In the President's Council sessions was he good at&#13;
&#13;
synthesizing what was being said? Did he listen to the debate&#13;
&#13;
and was he interested in having the debate? He must have&#13;
&#13;
brought these debates to some closure.     Was he good at this?&#13;
&#13;
How far did he get involved in the substance of the things?&#13;
&#13;
A:   His meetings tended to be long.     He wasn't very good at&#13;
&#13;
shutting people up; he was too polite and too patient to&#13;
&#13;
terminate debate even when the issues had been well defined.&#13;
&#13;
Yet, sometimes he became impatient and then he could shut a&#13;
&#13;
discussion down very effectively. In the final analysis,      I&#13;
&#13;
think it's fair to say that, after those discussions, he&#13;
&#13;
really relied on the senior officers who were responsible for&#13;
&#13;
the core areas -- management, finance, and operations. I&#13;
&#13;
don't think a lot of formal decisions were taken in the&#13;
&#13;
President's Council.&#13;
&#13;
     Clausen did meet with a subset of people -- a kind of&#13;
&#13;
executive committee --   to do career planning, discuss a&#13;
&#13;
World Development Report or consider strategic or complex&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 18&#13;
&#13;
issues.    This group included the two Senior Vice Presidents,&#13;
&#13;
the General Counsel, and the VP, Administration and&#13;
&#13;
Personnel, supplemented by others depending on the topic.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So your role was strengthened under Clausen?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Definitely.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Because he delegated a lot of the details to you.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes -- to me and to others. Certainly my influence&#13;
&#13;
increased a lot under Clausen.    I don't know that I did much&#13;
&#13;
more than I did before, but relatively it was more important&#13;
&#13;
since the President was involved in fewer issues and in less&#13;
&#13;
detail.&#13;
&#13;
     Not only was Clausen relatively uninvolved with project&#13;
&#13;
work, but he also did not deal as directly with the Board;&#13;
&#13;
relying more on staff to handle questions. Until Preston&#13;
&#13;
came, the Senior Vice Presidents attended every Board&#13;
&#13;
meeting,   (depending on the subject -- Finance, Economics or&#13;
&#13;
Operations) and sat next to the President.    Mr. McNamara&#13;
&#13;
frequently supplemented staff responses; Mr. Clausen left&#13;
&#13;
that pretty much to the Senior VPs.&#13;
&#13;
     And since we had also reorganized a bit, between&#13;
&#13;
Economics and the Operational Policy Staff, I was drawn more&#13;
&#13;
into policy discussions with the Board than before.     And I&#13;
&#13;
was much more involved in Board discussions dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
budget since Operations was a large component of the budget&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Stern (1/5/95), Page 19&#13;
&#13;
and the work program i.e. the volume and distribution of&#13;
&#13;
lending, always was of great interest.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now that McNamara was    gone,~   who was the Bank's point man&#13;
&#13;
in its relationships with Congress?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We had a difficult time with the IDA negotiations after&#13;
&#13;
Bob left. Our influence on The Hill and with the&#13;
&#13;
Administration, under the Republican Administration, was&#13;
&#13;
greatly diminished.   Mr. McNamara may not have been&#13;
&#13;
universally loved on The Hill,     but he was a widely known and&#13;
&#13;
respected figure. He had good contacts on both sides of the&#13;
&#13;
aisle. Mr. Clausen, while no stranger to Congress, had quite&#13;
&#13;
different relations. They derived from his position at the&#13;
&#13;
Bank of America; McNamara as a former Secretary of Defense&#13;
&#13;
and a close friend of the Kennedy's had been more of an&#13;
&#13;
insider. In addition, our relationship with Treasury&#13;
&#13;
deteriorated a bit under the Reagan Administration.&#13;
&#13;
     The Reagan Administration questioned the Bank's very&#13;
&#13;
purposes. They undertook a basic study of the institution&#13;
&#13;
which, to their surprise, concluded that the Bank served the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. interest. Nonetheless,    the~senior   Treasury officers were&#13;
&#13;
skeptical and not very supportive. It was a very difficult&#13;
&#13;
political time. The assumption that the Bank acted in the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. interest, which had been accepted for a long time, was&#13;
&#13;
under attack. The administration felt that the Bank was too&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 20&#13;
&#13;
involved in activities which should be handled by the private&#13;
&#13;
sector; that it did not pay sufficient attention to its&#13;
&#13;
mandate to be a lender of last resort.      They didn't want the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to become involved in too many areas.&#13;
&#13;
     Politically, it was a very rocky time in our relations&#13;
&#13;
with the   u.s.   Government. While Clausen had been appointed by&#13;
&#13;
a Democratic Administration, he was a California Republican.&#13;
&#13;
However, he wasn't part of Reagan's inner circle.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   A couple of other questions about Operations.      Were you&#13;
&#13;
trying to consciously change the mix of people in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
You said you introduced a new concept of career line&#13;
&#13;
development. Were you trying to shift the nature of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
personnel in any way?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.     I don't think so. That wasn't the objective of the&#13;
&#13;
career development stream.     We tried to give more weight to&#13;
&#13;
management skills in the selection of managers.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It was performance centered?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes; It wasn't a skill mix problem. Now, operationally&#13;
&#13;
during this period, the biggest thing, obviously, was the&#13;
&#13;
emergence of the debt crisis.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yeah.    We want to talk about that.    Can we talk about&#13;
&#13;
the structural adjustment lending first? It's introduction&#13;
&#13;
coincided more or less with your arrival here in this office.&#13;
&#13;
It took up a good deal of your time, and remained an area&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 21&#13;
where you had a lot of influence.&#13;
&#13;
How did you see this addition to the Bank's tool kit?     Did&#13;
&#13;
you think that this was a response to the oil crisis, which&#13;
&#13;
necessitated a closer look at the policy framework of these&#13;
&#13;
countries?   Or did you think that this was a welcomed long-&#13;
&#13;
term and necessary enlargement of the Bank's agenda and&#13;
&#13;
mandate?&#13;
&#13;
A:   We proposed structural adjustment lending three years&#13;
&#13;
before the debt crisis started. And yes, it did arise out of&#13;
&#13;
the oil crisis, and its impact on the developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
It was the beginning of defining concerns with the structural&#13;
&#13;
aspects of balance of payments adjustments rather than&#13;
&#13;
focusing solely on the macro-economic aspects. The concept&#13;
&#13;
that structural problems were at the core of the balance of&#13;
&#13;
payment difficulties facing many developing countries was not&#13;
&#13;
common then. The solution to balance of payments problems was&#13;
&#13;
generally believed to be macroeconomic adjustments. Our&#13;
&#13;
original concept was to help countries take action in advance&#13;
&#13;
of a deterioration in the balance of payments. In addition,&#13;
&#13;
the Bank had rarely made quick disbursing financing available&#13;
&#13;
because it was not the Bank's task to provide balance of&#13;
&#13;
payments support. And we went to great lengths to continue to&#13;
&#13;
emphasize the difference between balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
financing - which the IMF provided - and the financing of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 22&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment. To provide a loan for general import&#13;
&#13;
financing,   to encourage and support policy changes, was quite&#13;
&#13;
a new concept in the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     There were a lot of factors involved.    It was a period&#13;
&#13;
when balance of payments problems were looming.     The oil&#13;
&#13;
price increases had changed the import capacity and the&#13;
&#13;
economic prospects of the oil importing countries&#13;
&#13;
dramati~ally.   Commodity prices were depressed. Although there&#13;
&#13;
was substantial global liquidity -the result of having to&#13;
&#13;
recycle the increaseÂ· in revenues of the oil exporters - some&#13;
&#13;
countries were experiencing serious external financing&#13;
&#13;
problems. Moreover, it was clear that the volume of external&#13;
&#13;
borrowing could not be sustained and that major changes in&#13;
&#13;
domestic production, prices and exports would be required.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank, although it identified some of these problems in&#13;
&#13;
its country economic reports, was not well placed to deal&#13;
&#13;
with those kinds of issues at the operational level. It was a&#13;
&#13;
period when project finance was not the appropriate tool to&#13;
&#13;
help deal with the central issue facing the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries. Aggregate capital flows became much more important&#13;
&#13;
and the commercial banks became a major source of external&#13;
&#13;
capital by sovereign risk lending. The share of financing by&#13;
&#13;
the official institutions dropped sharply in the middle&#13;
&#13;
income countries. While macro-economic issues became the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (1/5/95), Page 23&#13;
&#13;
primary concern, and general sovereign-risk lending the&#13;
&#13;
principal type of financing, the Bank didn't have a seat at&#13;
&#13;
the policy table. It was consulted sometimes by oil exporters&#13;
&#13;
about how to handle their sudden increase in revenues, and&#13;
&#13;
occasionally by major oil importers about the problems facing&#13;
&#13;
them but it was not systemic. Nor did the Bank have any&#13;
&#13;
instruments to assist with these problems and its country&#13;
&#13;
analytical work did not provide an adequate basis for&#13;
&#13;
advising on the policy distortions which, at the national and&#13;
&#13;
sectoral level, impeded a rapid response to the changed&#13;
&#13;
external circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
     Here, to get back to an earlier question, my experience&#13;
&#13;
in AID was relevant. This absence of a basis for policy&#13;
&#13;
discussions with central policy makers had been a growing&#13;
&#13;
concern with the policy staff and, indeed, with Hollis&#13;
&#13;
Chenery. In other areas, such as income distribution, labor&#13;
&#13;
utilization and the capital intensive bias of the incentive&#13;
&#13;
structure, or price distortions affecting productivity in&#13;
&#13;
agriculture or industry, the inability to follow up in an&#13;
&#13;
operationally relevant way was felt increasingly. It was a&#13;
&#13;
view I shared strongly - that the Bank needed to be more&#13;
&#13;
directly involved in operationally relevant economic advise&#13;
&#13;
and take account of the policy framework in deciding on its&#13;
&#13;
volume of lending to a country. AID was never able to insist&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern {1/5/95), Page 24&#13;
&#13;
on very strict or precise conditionality in most countries&#13;
&#13;
because, to a very large extent, allocations were determined&#13;
&#13;
by political and foreign policy factors. Seriously linking&#13;
&#13;
AID allocations to policy change was difficult. But AID&#13;
&#13;
always had a seat at the table with the senior policy makers&#13;
&#13;
simply because it was a representative of a major power with&#13;
&#13;
a large assistance program. Discussions with a Finance&#13;
&#13;
Minister on specific issues were routine. At the Bank, on the&#13;
&#13;
other hand, while there were occasionally meetings with the&#13;
&#13;
Finance Minister and other core policy makers, much of the&#13;
&#13;
contact was with line ministries. Even when there were&#13;
&#13;
discussions of larger policy issues, based on an economic&#13;
&#13;
report on the country, with the Finance Minister, these&#13;
&#13;
tended to be general, with little link to the scale or&#13;
&#13;
composition of the lending.&#13;
&#13;
     And, it was becoming increasingly clear that successful,&#13;
&#13;
sustainable projects required improvements in sectoral&#13;
&#13;
policies and the incentive framework.&#13;
&#13;
     This was also the period when evaluation became&#13;
&#13;
important. Our studies revealed patterns of economy-wide&#13;
&#13;
issues {prices, access to credit, fiscal policy) adversely&#13;
&#13;
affecting project performance, but which could not be dealt&#13;
&#13;
with at the project level or even with the sectoral ministry&#13;
&#13;
concerned. And this, in turn; led the Bank to consider the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 25&#13;
&#13;
value of more comprehensive reviews of country portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
     All these strands contributed to our decision in 1978 to&#13;
&#13;
propose structural adjustment lending.&#13;
&#13;
     Looking back,   I don't think anybody could have&#13;
&#13;
articulated how adjustment lending was going to evolve in the&#13;
&#13;
1980's.   The initial memorandum only sketched it out&#13;
&#13;
generally.   We did not have any idea of what it was going to&#13;
&#13;
do to the Bank.   Some of the issues that were raised in that&#13;
&#13;
memo -- such as higher political profile for the Bank and its&#13;
&#13;
potential costs -- did materialize but we certainly did not&#13;
&#13;
foresee how fundamentally the involvement in structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending would change the Bank and is operational&#13;
&#13;
culture. Nor did we foresee the scope of the benefits to&#13;
&#13;
developing countries of our work on structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
issues or the role which would derive from that in the debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis.&#13;
&#13;
     The introduction of Stuctural Adjustment Lending in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was controversial for many different reasons.      Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors were concerned that we were infringing on the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
that we did not have the staff capacity to deal with these&#13;
&#13;
issues; that the Bank should stick to its fundamental role of&#13;
&#13;
project financing. They were also uncomfortable about the&#13;
&#13;
potential political risks, the changes it implied in our&#13;
&#13;
relations with borrowers and the possibility of increased&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 26&#13;
risk to the Bank's repayment record.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That was mainly the Part I countries.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, although there weren't many strong Part II country&#13;
&#13;
supporters.   As you know, before the debt crisis, there were&#13;
&#13;
very few takers for this product.   Nonetheless, the debates&#13;
&#13;
in the Board continued for a couple of years.   Many of the&#13;
&#13;
staff, particularly the project staff, did not like&#13;
&#13;
Structural Adjustment Lending either. They saw it as the&#13;
&#13;
culmination of McNamara's campaign to reduce the role of the&#13;
&#13;
technical staff. And indeed, over time, structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending boosted the role of the economists greatly -- more&#13;
&#13;
than intended perhaps. And project staff saw adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending as a "soft option" both compared to the precision&#13;
&#13;
required in projects (at least those with a physical&#13;
&#13;
component) and to the ability to measure results. They also&#13;
&#13;
doubted that the Bank would be willing to enforce its&#13;
&#13;
conditions. Partly these reactions were based on a romantic&#13;
&#13;
view of project financing. There were plenty of project&#13;
&#13;
conditions which were not met; the quantification of benefits&#13;
&#13;
often was inaccurate and, by this time, substantial lending&#13;
&#13;
was not for physical works.&#13;
&#13;
     Structural adjustment lending was a product that evolved&#13;
&#13;
more or less along the main lines that were intended, but in&#13;
&#13;
much greater depth and with a much wider scope than anybody&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 27&#13;
&#13;
had foreseen. The earliest operations were primitive by later&#13;
&#13;
standards - both in the precision with which objectives were&#13;
&#13;
stated and in the scope of the policy issues addressed. Our&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the scale of distortions was weak, as was&#13;
&#13;
our analytical base about sectoral policy problems. And,&#13;
&#13;
because of our lack of experience, we did not appreciate how&#13;
&#13;
difficult it was - politically and administratively - for&#13;
&#13;
countries to implement necessary policy changes.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:   It's related in a way to the changes you are introducing&#13;
&#13;
in Operations.    It reflects a view of systemic problems.&#13;
&#13;
There's a pattern coming out.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Certainly a fundamental point was that our project work&#13;
&#13;
was suffering because we (the Bank) were not dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
right people. Generally, those who were responsible for&#13;
&#13;
project design and implementation     -- the people we dealt&#13;
&#13;
with -- were not the people who decided on the policy&#13;
&#13;
framework which determined electricity prices, prices for&#13;
&#13;
agricultural products, fuel taxes, irrigation water charges,&#13;
&#13;
or the market system for agricultural or industrial output.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, on the fundamental issues of domestic resource&#13;
&#13;
mobilization,    (efficiency issues), the allocation and the&#13;
&#13;
pricing of scarce resources,    (role of markets and incentives)&#13;
&#13;
and the framework for private investment, we were not talking&#13;
&#13;
to the decisions-makers. Loan agreements often could not be&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (1/5/95), Page 28&#13;
&#13;
met (due to lack of counterpart funds or changes in the&#13;
&#13;
administered price structure, or import controls), because&#13;
&#13;
these issues were outside the scope of the projects and as a&#13;
&#13;
systemic issue with the central policy makers.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Why were the borrowers reluctant to participate in SALs&#13;
&#13;
at first?&#13;
&#13;
A:   That was very puzzling at the time and, of course, a bit&#13;
&#13;
embarrassing considering the controversy in the Board, with&#13;
&#13;
shareholders and among staff. We saw a major set of problems,&#13;
&#13;
and we had formulated a new lending instrument against a good&#13;
&#13;
deal of opposition and in the face of a fair amount of&#13;
&#13;
skepticism and only to find few clients interested. The only&#13;
&#13;
explanation I think was that governments are generally little&#13;
&#13;
interested in the major and painful policy changes before&#13;
&#13;
they face a crisis. Originally, we had conceived of&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment lending as a prophylactic approach -&#13;
&#13;
preventing balance of payments problems - and believed that&#13;
&#13;
attraction of quick disbursing loans would suffice to&#13;
&#13;
interest governments to act. We were wrong. Remember, this&#13;
&#13;
was a period of substantial world liquidity, so those&#13;
&#13;
countries which could have been eligible for structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending weren't necessarily short of money because&#13;
&#13;
they could borrow on market terms from commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
     In short, the governments were not willing to deal with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 29&#13;
structural problems which they themselves had not fully&#13;
&#13;
identified because there wasn't a crisis yet. That was the&#13;
&#13;
fundamental point. Furthermore, their own analyses of these&#13;
&#13;
issues were still pretty embryonic -- their analytical&#13;
&#13;
capacity was not then what it is today -- and neither were we&#13;
&#13;
as well equipped as we are today to spell out the issues, the&#13;
&#13;
policy concerns and the costs of the policy distortions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Maybe we should talk about Africa at this time.   This&#13;
&#13;
also occurred roughly at the time when you came into this&#13;
&#13;
office. At the 1979 Annual Meeting, the African Governors&#13;
&#13;
asked the Bank to do an assessment.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes. we responded promptly. The first report was done by&#13;
&#13;
Stanley Please, and this was followed by a report by Elliot&#13;
&#13;
Berg.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did you welcome the Africans' request. Was this&#13;
&#13;
something that you had perhaps even promoted?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No. I didn't engineer it.   Those early reports, both the&#13;
&#13;
original Stanley Please report and then Berg's report,&#13;
&#13;
improved our understanding of Africa.      I think it set in&#13;
&#13;
motion a chain of events which eventually led to the Special&#13;
&#13;
Program for Africa (SPA)    -- the very successful effort to&#13;
&#13;
improve coordination among donors in support of a clearer set&#13;
&#13;
of priorities in individual countries        and Africa&#13;
&#13;
Revisited, which is the latest report in the series focussing&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 30&#13;
&#13;
on Africa's problems.   Even then,   (in 1979/80) it was widely&#13;
&#13;
accepted that Africa's progress was far from satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
The world's problems hit Africa the worst.    The oil crisis,&#13;
&#13;
commodity price declines, and droughts hit them the hardest.&#13;
&#13;
The early Bank reports didn't emphasize governance issues as&#13;
&#13;
much as we do today, but implementation capacity and&#13;
&#13;
institutional weaknesses certainly were addressed. This was&#13;
&#13;
the beginning of a series of studies which explored why&#13;
&#13;
external assistance was not having the desired results in&#13;
&#13;
Africa. Looking back, it was really the beginning of a&#13;
&#13;
healthy process of discussion and thinking.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   It seems to me that there are two problems that come up&#13;
&#13;
right at this time -- the debt crisis and the African&#13;
&#13;
situation. Both could reflect problems in the economic&#13;
&#13;
analysis.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, actually the debt crisis broke in the Fall of 1983&#13;
&#13;
and its full scope was probably not clear for another year or&#13;
&#13;
so â&#128;¢. But in neither case do I think there was much wrong with&#13;
&#13;
the economic analysis per se. What these reports started to&#13;
&#13;
do was to highlight the non-economic aspects of African&#13;
&#13;
development.   We had not taken a very different approach to&#13;
&#13;
Africa in our operations than we took elsewhere. These&#13;
&#13;
reports, and those that followed, focussed on the fragile&#13;
&#13;
political structures in Africa, the embryonic nature of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 31&#13;
African political systems and that they were not really well&#13;
&#13;
equipped to develop consensus on economic issues.&#13;
&#13;
     The weaknesses of African institutions had certainly&#13;
&#13;
been known for quite some time. However, the implications of&#13;
&#13;
this widespread weakness had not been appreciated fully. The&#13;
&#13;
very large presence of expatriate advisors in Africa&#13;
&#13;
reflected the great paucity of local technical skills, but&#13;
&#13;
also an unfortunate habit of the donors, maintained for too&#13;
&#13;
long, to do things for the Africans.   They were not prepared&#13;
&#13;
to rely on the domestic abilities - weak though they were -&#13;
&#13;
and consequently reduced the sense of accountability and&#13;
&#13;
increased dependence. One of the early reports on Africa&#13;
&#13;
already identified the problem of too many expatriates and&#13;
&#13;
too much technical assistance; today, that problem is more&#13;
&#13;
widely recognized and understood.&#13;
&#13;
     The Africa reports encouraged people to consider the&#13;
&#13;
need to build Africa's economies from the bottom up. You&#13;
&#13;
couldn't substitute for domestic capacity by foreign&#13;
&#13;
advisors, functioning at the top. It was not the economic&#13;
&#13;
advice that was wrong.   It was how that advice was being&#13;
&#13;
applied in local conditions. How were aid flows used? What&#13;
&#13;
kind of projects did they start? What institutions were built&#13;
&#13;
and how were they nurtured? The importance of these issues&#13;
&#13;
was not well understood in the early days of the Africa work,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Stern (1/5/95), Page 32&#13;
&#13;
by us and by the whole donor community.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      In a sense, of course, many of these concerns had been&#13;
&#13;
present already.       I remember the discussions that went on&#13;
&#13;
when all these countries became independent, when people&#13;
&#13;
said, well, how are they ever going to manage?       But somehow&#13;
&#13;
they have been forgotten in the meantime.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I.donâ&#128;¢t know that the illusion of success lasted very&#13;
&#13;
long.       Many inherited existing and functioning institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This was particularly true in East Africa--Tanzania, Uganda,&#13;
&#13;
and Kenya. These places started with a pretty good&#13;
&#13;
administrative structure, civil service, etc.       On the west&#13;
&#13;
side, the French also left behind a decent administrative&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure.       These institutions worked well at the&#13;
&#13;
beginning, but they began to deteriorate. Tanzania essenially&#13;
&#13;
ran its institutions into the ground; Uganda ended up with&#13;
&#13;
Idi Amin who left no administrative systems in place.&#13;
&#13;
Certainly people were aware of these problems before the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's reports; but the reports helped to understand why&#13;
&#13;
simply providing money and expatriate advisors was not&#13;
&#13;
enough; indeed why sometimes it even was counterproductive.&#13;
&#13;
The institutional infrastructure was too weak to absorb aid&#13;
&#13;
effectively; to adapt the advise, the project designs, the&#13;
&#13;
technology, to local conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I   (Mr. Kraska) still remember coming to you with these&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (1/5/95), Page 33&#13;
proposals for structural adjustment loans in Africa and your&#13;
&#13;
response was that SALs were not created for Africa.&#13;
&#13;
     I always found this position a bit hypocritical. On the&#13;
&#13;
one hand, we had Elliott Berg and sons of Berg identifying&#13;
&#13;
all these policy, institutional, and governance problems, yet&#13;
&#13;
we didn't use the tools we had to deal with these things. We&#13;
&#13;
didn't make the most of our seat at the table.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I do not think that position was hypocritical. I&#13;
&#13;
still am pretty skeptical of the utility of structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending in Africa - precisely because of the&#13;
&#13;
reasons we have been talking about. I think structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending was designed as a tool which works in an&#13;
&#13;
economy where you have reasonable functioning institutions,&#13;
&#13;
an effective civil service, and an economy with at least some&#13;
&#13;
of the tools to manage fiscal and monetary policy and a&#13;
&#13;
banking system. The Africa Region was attracted to the quick&#13;
&#13;
disbursing aspect of adjustment lending and seriously&#13;
&#13;
underestimated, even ignored, the difference in time between&#13;
&#13;
a loan which disburses in 18-24 months and the need to build&#13;
&#13;
institutions in addition to changing policies.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You don't have to have the other kinds of conditions?&#13;
&#13;
A:   These are, of course, matters of degree. But, I still&#13;
&#13;
believe that SALs are a very poor tool to build institutions&#13;
&#13;
from scratch, or to implement civil service reform. I think&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 34&#13;
the record is very clear on that. And, I think it is clear to&#13;
&#13;
me - and I know to others - that the very extensive use of&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment lending in Africa -- after the post&#13;
&#13;
1987 team in Operations was more permissive than I -- was&#13;
&#13;
neither very effective on the macro side nor very germane to&#13;
&#13;
the institutional issues. It became precisely what we had not&#13;
&#13;
wanted it to become, general balance of payments support and&#13;
&#13;
the long-term dependence that implies. It is true, however,&#13;
&#13;
that some of the structural adjustment loans to Africa were,&#13;
&#13;
in fact, useful in some countries. The depth of the policy&#13;
&#13;
distortions turned out to be very grave --in agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
trade, subsidy payments, interest rates and credit -- and in&#13;
&#13;
some cases adjustment lending helped to bring about needed&#13;
&#13;
changes. Nevertheless, it has been very hard for African&#13;
&#13;
governments to implement SAL conditions or to sustain&#13;
&#13;
adjustment programs. It was hard for the governments to sell&#13;
&#13;
it domestically; to develop a concensus. There's no easy&#13;
&#13;
means of dissemination. The private entrepreneurial sector&#13;
&#13;
was small. The agricultural sector, and the poor, inchoates&#13;
&#13;
and not very articulate participants in the political&#13;
&#13;
process. It often was hard to get the Parliament or the other&#13;
&#13;
Ministries on board. The implementation problems were&#13;
&#13;
different than elsewhere.   While SALs did some useful things&#13;
&#13;
in Africa, particularly when the crisis got deeper and the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 35&#13;
&#13;
balance of payments problems got larger, I remain convinced&#13;
&#13;
that structural adjustment lending is better suited to more&#13;
&#13;
advanced economies with more developed economic systems.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I thought we could go into the debt crisis at this&#13;
&#13;
point.   And I've read one of the other interviews, in which&#13;
&#13;
you say that you saw this coming yourself. Why did so few&#13;
&#13;
people see this coming?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I am not sure I ever put it that way. But, just last&#13;
&#13;
week, the Mexican peso hit rock bottom, and all of the&#13;
&#13;
intelligent people in New York -- professionals in the&#13;
&#13;
financial markets -- claimed to have been misled. "They told&#13;
&#13;
us they weren't going to devalue,"   they said. I don't think&#13;
&#13;
it took a lot of foresight to see that the Mexican peso was&#13;
&#13;
overvalued.   The current account deficit was large and&#13;
&#13;
unsustainable and short-term foreign borrowing was increasing&#13;
&#13;
sharply. If the fundamentals are out of line, and no remedial&#13;
&#13;
action is taken, any overvalued currency will crack sooner or&#13;
&#13;
later.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I've never known a Finance Minister who said two months,&#13;
&#13;
one month, one week, one day in advance, "I'm going to&#13;
&#13;
devalue tomorrow night."   Yet, the entire financial community&#13;
&#13;
claimed that they didn't know there was a problem.   The debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis was the same way. In those days, nobody believed that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 36&#13;
countries could go bankrupt -- Walter Wriston of Citibank was&#13;
&#13;
famous for that assertion.   Nobody knew what that meant, but&#13;
&#13;
many people accepted it as an article of faith.   Debt service&#13;
&#13;
ratios exceeded 25 percent, - a level previously thought to&#13;
&#13;
have been an upper limit - but no one seemed to care.&#13;
&#13;
Everyone expected exports to continue growing more rapidly&#13;
&#13;
than debt service and debt to be eroded by inflation. It was&#13;
&#13;
a classic speculative bubble.&#13;
&#13;
     The world was very liquid in the late 70's, and&#13;
&#13;
everybody was looking for places to invest funds. The&#13;
&#13;
developing countries were willing to borrow instead of&#13;
&#13;
adjusting their consumption to their reduced purchasing power&#13;
&#13;
and they seemed to offer respectable returns. All the&#13;
&#13;
traditional analytical benchmarks got swept away. "Old&#13;
&#13;
fashioned, " they said.&#13;
&#13;
     In retrospect, I don't think that the origins of the&#13;
&#13;
debt crisis were very complex, although there were several&#13;
&#13;
contributing factors. There was a concerted attack by the G-7&#13;
&#13;
on inflation. The concerted nature of the attack came as a&#13;
&#13;
surprise. And the effort was successful. Bankers had&#13;
&#13;
discovered the floating lending rate which shifted the&#13;
&#13;
interest rate risk from the lender to the borrower. I don't&#13;
&#13;
think it was fully understood - certainly not by the&#13;
&#13;
borrowers - what this implied in a non-inflationary&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 37&#13;
environment with relatively high real interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
Interest rates which, in real terms had been zero or negative&#13;
&#13;
on fixed interest loans, became positive. At the same time,&#13;
&#13;
the anti-inflationary policies slowed growth and reduced&#13;
&#13;
demand for exports from developing countries. Consequently,&#13;
&#13;
commodity prices turned down.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You had sensed this coming from the late '70s forward?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, although I was hardly alone. But the mood was all&#13;
&#13;
in the other direction.&#13;
Q:   No one was asking the Bank for help?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Before the debt crisis broke, cautionary comments about&#13;
&#13;
debt service capacity really were ignored and so were efforts&#13;
&#13;
to improve resource allocation, particularly in the oil-&#13;
&#13;
exporting countries. When Mexico got in trouble, it was&#13;
&#13;
initially seen as a liquidity problem to be handled by the&#13;
&#13;
IMF rather than a structural issue. It was seen as a&#13;
&#13;
temporary balance of payments issue. When discussions started&#13;
&#13;
on concerted financing for Mexico, the Bank was invited but&#13;
&#13;
it was pretty proforma. We were not expected to play a major&#13;
&#13;
role in the negotiations .and we did not. Our financial flows&#13;
&#13;
derived exclusively from project disbursements. And since the&#13;
&#13;
pace of the disbursements was not under our control, it was&#13;
&#13;
neither a catalyst for, nor a suitable component of, the&#13;
&#13;
overall financing package. We did not have the basis for the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 38&#13;
&#13;
quick disbursing lending in support of policy reforms.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   They didn't invite you because they wanted no help at&#13;
&#13;
that point?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.    !n those days, the discussions were based on the&#13;
&#13;
premise that Mexico's debt crisis was a liquidity problem,&#13;
&#13;
not a structural problem.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In your own view it was not a liquidity problem, but a&#13;
&#13;
structural problem.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.     And so it was.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What did you try to _do in response to that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Analysis of the causes of the crises started early. And&#13;
&#13;
as the full scale of the problem emerged, and alternative&#13;
&#13;
solutions.were explored, it became clearer that more than a&#13;
&#13;
cash flow problem was at issue. This was still long before&#13;
&#13;
the debates on the proper sequencing of policy change and,&#13;
&#13;
indeed, well before the full scope of the policy distortions&#13;
&#13;
was well understood. We started in Mexico with a&#13;
&#13;
collaborative effort to liberalize the trade regime -&#13;
&#13;
reducing tariffs and quantitative restrictions - and a number&#13;
&#13;
of sectorally focused policy operations. David Knox was Vice&#13;
&#13;
President of the Latin America region then, and Pieter&#13;
&#13;
Bottelier the economist in the country department did an&#13;
&#13;
outstanding job in working with the. government to begin to&#13;
&#13;
address these structural issues.    However, it took about a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           Stern (1/5/95), Page 39&#13;
&#13;
year and a half of collaborative research and negotiations to&#13;
&#13;
persuade the Mexicans to begin to open up their economy, and&#13;
&#13;
to increase competition in order to enhance productivity.&#13;
&#13;
These measures were part of a series of policy actions&#13;
&#13;
necessary to improve the efficiency of the economy and&#13;
&#13;
enhance, over time, their creditworthiness.&#13;
&#13;
     It was in this period that Structural Adjustment Lending&#13;
&#13;
became an operational tool. The issues the Bank sought to&#13;
&#13;
address in those days - trade liberalization, price&#13;
&#13;
decontrol, the internal market, the foreign investment&#13;
&#13;
framework, energy pricing - became topics of discussion&#13;
&#13;
between the Bank and the IMF, and with the U.S. Government.&#13;
&#13;
The U.S. Government played a major role in the debt crisis&#13;
&#13;
from the outset because of the massive systemic risk to the&#13;
&#13;
banking system, particularly in the U.S. and Japan.&#13;
&#13;
Gradually, the Bank's SAL commitments -- size, timing and&#13;
&#13;
conditionality -- became a key part of the refinancing&#13;
&#13;
effort.&#13;
&#13;
     This put greater leverage behind our conditions as our&#13;
&#13;
participation in the total financing package became&#13;
&#13;
increasingly important to the commercial banks. Initially the&#13;
&#13;
focus was on the money; but gradually the substance of our&#13;
&#13;
conditionality was seen as important and became preconditions&#13;
&#13;
for releases of cmm:n-=rcial bank funds.   SAL~   also drew us into&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 40&#13;
&#13;
the top group of people who were trying to manage the debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis in the major governments and central banks. We were&#13;
&#13;
part of the Baker Plan and Brady Plan packages. The Bank was&#13;
&#13;
also drawn into discussions with the CEOs of the commercial&#13;
&#13;
banks who were arranging the refinancing, and later the debt&#13;
&#13;
reductions. When we used our guarantee authority -- for the&#13;
&#13;
first time since the Bank's early days --we became involved&#13;
&#13;
in the pricing of guarantees and the associated loans.&#13;
&#13;
     These substantive issues, which involved the Treasury&#13;
&#13;
Secretary, and the Chairman of the Fed; G-7 Finance&#13;
&#13;
Ministries and Central Banks, and the commercial banks forced&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and Fund into closer cooperation. Initially, this&#13;
&#13;
caused some friction. It was hard for the Fund to accept&#13;
&#13;
another institution into discussions it had seen as its&#13;
&#13;
preserve, particularly since the staff of the Bank did not&#13;
&#13;
have the experience with the discipline and discretion these&#13;
&#13;
delicate issues often required.   And it took a while for the&#13;
&#13;
Fund to accept the importance of the structural factors and&#13;
&#13;
their effect on productivity, competitiveness and the&#13;
&#13;
sustainabiity of the balance of payments equilibrium. Their&#13;
&#13;
outlook changed over time. The Bank staff had an equally&#13;
&#13;
difficult time in adjusting to the collaboration. They were&#13;
&#13;
less disciplined analytically and often felt very free to&#13;
&#13;
explore alternative designs - even when negotiations on a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern {1/5/95), Page 41&#13;
&#13;
package already were in progress. And, in the beginning, they&#13;
&#13;
had an inadequate appreciation of the importance of&#13;
&#13;
stabilization. Sometimes they seemed to offer borrowers the&#13;
&#13;
softer option. But their attitudes and approach also changed&#13;
&#13;
over time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did Clausen become more hands-on in this period, dealing&#13;
&#13;
with the banks and so on?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, Mr. Clausen believed in delegation. But this was a&#13;
&#13;
subject of considerable interest to him and one about which&#13;
&#13;
he knew a great deal. In those days, from time to time, we&#13;
&#13;
did a lot of telephoning around to persuade banks to join the&#13;
&#13;
refinancing package or the rescheduling package. Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Clausen's contacts with senior bankers was useful there, as&#13;
&#13;
was his understanding of the objectives of the commercial&#13;
&#13;
banks - And he was deeply involved in the discussions with&#13;
&#13;
the Treasury and the trilateral discussions between Treasury,&#13;
&#13;
the Fund and the Bank.   I did a fair amount of that as well.&#13;
&#13;
By then there was a group of us who handled those matters,&#13;
&#13;
including a number of people from Finance -- Joe Wood, David&#13;
&#13;
Bock, and one or two others. They were involved in the&#13;
&#13;
reschedulings from the Bank's financial perspective. They&#13;
&#13;
spent a lot of time on these issues, particularly when we&#13;
&#13;
started to use guarantees, and they handled the technical&#13;
&#13;
aspects of negotiations with the banks. Our involvement in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 42&#13;
&#13;
the debt problem substantially changed our relations with the&#13;
&#13;
financial community. Up to then, our relations were primarily&#13;
&#13;
with our underwriting firms supplemented by the occasional&#13;
&#13;
cofinancing arrangement with commercial banks. In the debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis, the World Bank was dealing with a group of people in&#13;
&#13;
the U.S., Europe and Japan with major exposure to developing&#13;
&#13;
country sovereign debt.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This was also when the B-loansÂ· 'came out.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Mr. Clausen always was a great fan of co-financing.   And&#13;
&#13;
as you know, co-financing has always attracted the interests&#13;
&#13;
of financial minds in commercial banking, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
u.s.   and Japan. It was seen by the private banks as an&#13;
&#13;
inexpensive way of reducing the risk of sovereign risk&#13;
&#13;
lending to developing countries. But, it never really worked&#13;
&#13;
because the World Bank never offered any real security to the&#13;
&#13;
commercial banks. We were reluctant to share our preferred&#13;
&#13;
creditor status by associating commercial bank lending&#13;
&#13;
legally with ours (a formal cross default clause). The&#13;
&#13;
informal arrangements we offered only committed us to make&#13;
&#13;
"best efforts" in case of rescheduling. When the debt crisis&#13;
&#13;
broke, it proved generally impossible to protect the co-&#13;
&#13;
financed loans. The commercial banks understood pretty well&#13;
&#13;
the limited "enhancement" we were offering.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     They could pretend that you offered security?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Stern (1/5/95), Page 43&#13;
&#13;
A:      No.   We never gave the commercial banks any comfort&#13;
&#13;
other than a "best effort" to exempt them from rescheduling.&#13;
&#13;
This was a time of high liquidity before the debt crisis, and&#13;
&#13;
commercial banks were not shy about taking on risk. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
had always been trying to get the commercial banks to co-&#13;
&#13;
finance World Bank projects, but      it never became very big&#13;
&#13;
business. After the debt crisis broke,      we were unable to&#13;
&#13;
protect any of our co-financed loans. So that was the end of&#13;
&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
        We did for a while, put a B-loan program in place which&#13;
&#13;
involved payment sharing with the banks. But this was badly&#13;
&#13;
designed - it gave away too much since we agreed to go pari&#13;
&#13;
passu in payments with the commercial banks.      This clearly&#13;
&#13;
was a mistake of mine. We tried too hard to develop a more&#13;
&#13;
attractive co-financing package and we went too far. I&#13;
&#13;
stopped the program before it got too far. We did persuade a&#13;
&#13;
few Central banks to reduce capital requirements for banks on&#13;
&#13;
co-financed loans - but in general, it had little impact.&#13;
&#13;
        During the debt crisis -- particularly when the emphasis&#13;
&#13;
was on refinancing -- there was a lot of pressure on Japan to&#13;
&#13;
assist. Their Export-Import Bank substantially liberalized&#13;
&#13;
their financing terms for loans in support of Bank programs&#13;
&#13;
or projects --      for example, such funds were untied. They&#13;
&#13;
made major contributions to refinancing packages in Mexico,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 44&#13;
&#13;
Argentina and Indonesia. It was considered co-financing with&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank, and accounted for that way by us and by them,&#13;
&#13;
but it was co-financing in the loosest possible sense. The&#13;
&#13;
loans financed Bank-supported programs, but there were no&#13;
&#13;
legal links to our loans.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did the debt crisis affect the Bank's relationship&#13;
&#13;
with Treasury?   Baker was obviously playing a very big role&#13;
&#13;
in this issue.&#13;
A:    During the debt crisis, the Bank and the Treasury had&#13;
&#13;
very good relations, particularly once our adjustment&#13;
&#13;
financing and guarantee operations made us important&#13;
&#13;
components of the financing packages.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I thought that, initially, the U.S. showed very little&#13;
&#13;
interest in the debt crisis.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I am not sure that's right because the crisis was&#13;
&#13;
concentrated in Latin America, so the U.S. was interested in&#13;
&#13;
that angle from the beginning. And there was perceived to be&#13;
&#13;
a systemic risk to the banking system in the U.S. -- and&#13;
&#13;
indeed elsewhere. Mr. Baker was an activist on the subject&#13;
&#13;
and he welcomed a larger, more direct role by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     The first debt deal in which we played a large role was&#13;
&#13;
Chile.' s. They had a good economic program but a poor&#13;
&#13;
political reputation. It was the first time we used (or&#13;
&#13;
proposed to use) the Bank's guarantee.    We had used our&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 45&#13;
&#13;
guarantee authority once before in a small way in an iron ore&#13;
&#13;
mine project in Brazil. We extended a guarantee which Brazil&#13;
&#13;
had gotten from the European Coal and Steel Community from&#13;
&#13;
nine years to ten years so they could obtain longer maturity&#13;
&#13;
financing.   It's an interesting twist because the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
Articles of Agreement actually assumed that we would be&#13;
&#13;
operating mostly on the basis of guarantees. But guarantees&#13;
&#13;
had not been used since the very early days. I had always&#13;
&#13;
been attracted to guarantees as a means of mobilizing private&#13;
&#13;
capital -- and so we had proposed to resurrect it as part of&#13;
&#13;
our co-financing approach. The proposal for Brazil was&#13;
&#13;
approved because it was very small, but in general, there was&#13;
&#13;
a good deal of opposition to guarantees. Although under&#13;
&#13;
Articles, we have to charge the face value of a guarantee&#13;
&#13;
against our capital, just as a loan, there were many people&#13;
&#13;
who feared the risk of guarantees based on national&#13;
&#13;
experiences where guarantees had been issued off balance&#13;
&#13;
sheets. Others opposed guarantees on the grounds that it&#13;
&#13;
would be a less effective way of influencing project design&#13;
&#13;
or implementation or provide technical assistance to our&#13;
&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
     It was very hard for the commercial banks, led by&#13;
&#13;
Manufacturers Hanover, to put a deal together for Chile. We&#13;
&#13;
considered, together with Manufacturers Hanover, the use of&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 46&#13;
our guarantee of a portion of the roll-over financing. The&#13;
&#13;
U.S. was very dubious about the use of our guarantee&#13;
&#13;
authority because they felt the banks ought to bear the risk&#13;
&#13;
of the refinancing. I remember a long luncheon we had with&#13;
&#13;
Mr. de Larosiere, Managing Director of the Fund, Mr.McCouch&#13;
&#13;
from Manny Hanny, and Mr. Mulford, the Undersecretary of the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. Treasury.   Mulford was extremely skeptical. His line was&#13;
&#13;
."Why can't the market take care of this? Why should the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank share in the risk?" But the bankers were very emphatic&#13;
&#13;
that without official enhancement the financing could not be&#13;
&#13;
arranged. Later that day, Mr. Mulford agreed that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
could issue a guarantee for the commercial banks' financing.&#13;
&#13;
That was the first time we used that structure. Subsequently,&#13;
&#13;
we used it in two Mexican reschedulings.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This idea is coming from your office?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Nothing comes from one person. But I was an advocate of&#13;
&#13;
the use of guarantees, made it an instrument we could discuss&#13;
&#13;
with the commercial banks as an instrument to keep banks in&#13;
&#13;
the refinancing package - which became increasingly difficult&#13;
&#13;
-- and in persuading the U.S. Government. There was a special&#13;
&#13;
team in Finance to help deal with debt related issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You mentioned the relationships with Treasury and I have&#13;
&#13;
an old friend that I knew when he was an economic historian,&#13;
&#13;
named Al Fishlow.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Stern (1/5/95), Page 47&#13;
A:   Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When the Fishlow situation broke I was sort of stunned.&#13;
&#13;
Would you like to talk a little bit about that?&#13;
&#13;
A:   You mean, how he almost became chief economist?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Al was a very capable person. He was well connected with&#13;
&#13;
the group we were talking about the last time -- the&#13;
&#13;
development economists outside the Bank. He was very&#13;
&#13;
knowledgeable about Latin America and had a very good&#13;
&#13;
reputation. However, the external world had changed markedly&#13;
&#13;
and Al was seen as too radical for the Bank. A good deal of&#13;
&#13;
opposition developed to him.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Where did that opposition come from?&#13;
&#13;
A:   From the new U.S. Administration.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This happened even before McNamara left?&#13;
&#13;
A:   No.    We had gone through a list of candidates while&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was still here. He favored Al but he made no&#13;
&#13;
appointment. He believed, correctly in my view, that the&#13;
&#13;
appointment should be the prerogative of his successor. So,&#13;
&#13;
when Tom Clausen arrived, the candidate list was ready, and I&#13;
&#13;
guess Clausen knew Fishlow from California. They had a common&#13;
&#13;
interest in Latin America where the Bank of America was very&#13;
&#13;
active; so it wasn't just a name to him. And undoubtedly,&#13;
&#13;
McNamara conveyed his preference to Clausen.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Stern (1/5/95), Page 48&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Can someone use that as a defining incident in a power&#13;
&#13;
relationship, or is it just an aberration?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Defining incident for whom?&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Of a   part~cular   power relationship between a significant&#13;
&#13;
donor and the institution?&#13;
&#13;
A:     It happens.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Are there any other similar incidents that you can think&#13;
&#13;
of?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Well, senior outside appointments are not that frequent.&#13;
&#13;
But, for instance, the Japanese have a strong view whenever&#13;
&#13;
we appoint the Director of our Tokyo office, who always is a&#13;
&#13;
Japanese, or when we appoint a new Vice President for Co-&#13;
&#13;
financing, who has always been Japanese.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Do they get their way?&#13;
&#13;
A:     For these positions - generally.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    When you had to find someone to replace Fishlow, did the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. get deeply involved? Was Anne Krueger on the original&#13;
&#13;
list of candidates?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes, I am pretty sure she was. She certainly was in the&#13;
&#13;
same professional league. To tell you the truth, I never knew&#13;
&#13;
what the ideological difference between the two was supposed&#13;
&#13;
to be ..&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Someone did.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Someone presumed they did. What it was, I don't know.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 49&#13;
&#13;
But to answer your question - I don't think the U.S. retained&#13;
&#13;
an interest in the appointment process after the Fishlow&#13;
&#13;
incident.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did it make any difference in terms of the operation of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I don't know.   I've never seen Al operate in this&#13;
&#13;
context so it's hard to say.   There is a large administrative&#13;
&#13;
component to the job which not everyone from the academic&#13;
&#13;
side is comfortable with. I have no idea how Al would have&#13;
&#13;
reacted. Anne cetainly left strong opinions about her&#13;
&#13;
management behind her.&#13;
&#13;
     I never understood that either.   It is true that she was&#13;
&#13;
a very determined woman with strong opinions. But I think&#13;
&#13;
those are virtues. She was a very good analyst. She&#13;
&#13;
restructured the research program, after Chenery's 12 years&#13;
&#13;
tenure. Chenery's research style stressed quantitative,&#13;
&#13;
macroeconomic modeling much more than Anne's did.&#13;
&#13;
     And the research priorities changed, and as Anne tried&#13;
&#13;
to make research more operationally relevant, some people on&#13;
&#13;
the economic staff felt alienated. A lot of people complained&#13;
&#13;
about her management style. But in my view, Anne did a lot.&#13;
&#13;
She was a great asset to have around during this period when&#13;
&#13;
we focused increasingly on adjustment operations, trade&#13;
&#13;
liberalization, macroeconomic conditionallity, and relations&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             Stern (1/5/95), Page 50&#13;
with the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The changes she introduced, did they fit together with&#13;
&#13;
the things you were doing in order to get control of&#13;
&#13;
operational policy?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yes. Anne and I had a very good working relationship.&#13;
&#13;
We tended to think alike about many issues -- the&#13;
&#13;
conditionality and the relevance of research.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Compared to Chenery, she was much more proactive from an&#13;
&#13;
operational perspective.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Absolutely.         Except for a few big countries, Chenery&#13;
&#13;
tended to look at countries as part of patterns of&#13;
&#13;
development. Anne was much more interested in dealing with&#13;
&#13;
the nuts and bolts of actual national economic systems.&#13;
&#13;
That's certainly true.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   We've described a situation in which you've got an awful&#13;
&#13;
lot on your plate at this point. When does the environmental&#13;
&#13;
issue really get on your scope?         Can you fix that relative to&#13;
&#13;
the change in leadership?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I don't know.         McNamara had an environmental&#13;
&#13;
advisor.        When was that?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I   72 â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
A:   ~is        name was Lee or something?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   James Lee. He appointed him after his Stockholm speech.&#13;
&#13;
A:   This issue had been around for a while and it became&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Stern (1/5/95), Page 51&#13;
&#13;
more important as time went by. Gradually, we put more rules&#13;
&#13;
in place to make sure that our projects did not degrade the&#13;
&#13;
environment. But, in McNamara's time, we did not go beyond&#13;
&#13;
this damage limitation approach. The systemic issues --&#13;
&#13;
national environmental plans and national environmental&#13;
&#13;
legislation were not yet part of the operational framework.&#13;
&#13;
We were not very proactive.&#13;
&#13;
     During Clausen's period, some of these bigger Bank&#13;
&#13;
projects got a high level of external attention. But I don't&#13;
&#13;
believe that we fully understood the scale of the problem,&#13;
&#13;
both in terms of the public relations and the substantive&#13;
&#13;
issues. Barber Conable was much more proactive and open on&#13;
&#13;
this subject.   I think he took it on, in part because of the&#13;
&#13;
criticism and, being more politically sensitive, he wanted to&#13;
&#13;
be sure we dealt with it. However, he also was genuinely&#13;
&#13;
sensitive to the issue.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Between,   '81 and '86, did you introduce any kind of&#13;
&#13;
changes as far as the review of projects?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   During that period, we consistently tightened up&#13;
&#13;
procedures. Operational guidance on resettlement issues, on&#13;
&#13;
the treatment of indigenous people, on the environmental&#13;
&#13;
impact of dams, were formulated during this period. Some of&#13;
&#13;
these operational guidelines were seen as the most advanced&#13;
&#13;
at the time, and were models used by the regional banks. At&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 52&#13;
&#13;
that time, a lot of people felt that they went too far, but&#13;
&#13;
some are still seen as fully appropriate today. However,&#13;
&#13;
while we expanded the Environment Department, we had not&#13;
&#13;
added environmental staff to the regional staffs, to enhance&#13;
&#13;
their capacity to identify environmental issues early on in&#13;
&#13;
project design.   I don't mean to suggest that we were&#13;
&#13;
innocent of the problems, but the Bank was slow in&#13;
&#13;
recognizing the environment as a special subject requiring&#13;
&#13;
special staff, special skills, and special supervision. It&#13;
&#13;
was seen more as an issue which could be left to the&#13;
&#13;
operating staff, if the policy framework was appropriate. We&#13;
&#13;
were too slow to understand fully the complexities of&#13;
&#13;
environmental policy.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   If you look back over the programs up through '87, which&#13;
&#13;
of those programs have been the most successful in reducing&#13;
&#13;
poverty?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Certainly McNamara was very much into what we are doing&#13;
&#13;
today -- primary education, health, population, urban issues.&#13;
&#13;
He considered these areas the foundation of a successful&#13;
&#13;
poverty-oriented policy --   and so they are.&#13;
&#13;
     A lot of poverty-oriented work was done during&#13;
&#13;
McNamara's time. He was very much interested in the building&#13;
&#13;
blocks -- population, health, education, nutrition, urban&#13;
&#13;
redevelopment. McNamara was very aware that the basic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (1/5/95), Page 53&#13;
&#13;
objective of development was to reduce poverty. He is the one&#13;
&#13;
who developed the concept of absolute poverty, which is still&#13;
&#13;
used as a benchmark. We started with relative poverty and the&#13;
&#13;
equity issue. But, McNamara in one of his speeches, developed&#13;
&#13;
the concept of absolute poverty, defined as people who were&#13;
&#13;
below a minimal living standard. It built on the "basic human&#13;
&#13;
needs"concept which was very popular at the time. So the&#13;
&#13;
analytical focus on poverty reduction were put in place&#13;
&#13;
during Mr. McNamara's period. I do not believe Mr. Clausen&#13;
&#13;
changed that explicitly but there is no doubt that the debt&#13;
&#13;
crisis shifted the Bank's attention to structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
     Nonetheless, the focus on poverty, its causes, and&#13;
&#13;
approaches to its alleviation had its own momentum. We&#13;
&#13;
produced a WDR on primary education (a subject Mr. Clausen&#13;
&#13;
attached a great deal of importance to); and work on other&#13;
&#13;
factors of special relevance to low income groups continued.&#13;
&#13;
But the roots were in the earlier period.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You have now implemented a lot of programs to tighten&#13;
&#13;
control and evaluate policies. What did you consider the most&#13;
&#13;
successful of those programs?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Among the poverty programs?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Yes.   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, I, I think I have two candidates for poverty&#13;
&#13;
programs which won't appear on any of the Bank's press&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       Stern (1/5/95), Page 54&#13;
&#13;
 releases.Â· One very important thing we have done for poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and poverty reduction is adjustment lending, because, no&#13;
&#13;
matter what anybody says, development was financed on the&#13;
&#13;
backs of the poorest segments of the population, namely the&#13;
&#13;
rural population.   They got nowhere near fair terms of trade.&#13;
&#13;
They were manipulated -- whether it was in Africa through the&#13;
&#13;
marketing boards, or in India through the controls of the&#13;
&#13;
grain movements. Every country had a different system, but&#13;
&#13;
.the net result always was the same--large amounts of income&#13;
&#13;
were diverted from the poorest parts of the population by&#13;
&#13;
keeping the prices of their products articially low. At the&#13;
&#13;
same time, subsidies and social services benefitted the&#13;
&#13;
better off. Breaking the pattern, getting world market prices&#13;
&#13;
 for farmers, redirecting budgetary expenditures, has made a&#13;
&#13;
major difference to the rural areas and to the well-being of&#13;
&#13;
countless people.&#13;
&#13;
      By addressing those price distortions, we have done a&#13;
&#13;
good deal to promote investment, entrepreneurial activity,&#13;
&#13;
small scale enterprises and employment opportunities by&#13;
&#13;
reducing or eliminating the strong bias toward capital-&#13;
&#13;
 intensive investments. We helped many countries onto a&#13;
&#13;
pattern of sustainable growth, with a much broader&#13;
&#13;
participation by people in that growth. But I realize that&#13;
&#13;
 this isn't the common view.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                      Stern (1/5/95), Page 55&#13;
     The second program that I think has been the most&#13;
&#13;
successful is the restructured extension service program.&#13;
&#13;
That program has benefitted more farmers per dollar,    (and&#13;
&#13;
even in absolute terms) than any other.   I believe that it&#13;
&#13;
has had a hugely positive impact on the income of&#13;
&#13;
participating farmers in India, Africa, Indonesia and&#13;
&#13;
elsewhere and has changed fundamentally our conception of how&#13;
&#13;
public services can be delivered effectively.&#13;
&#13;
     Certainly there were many other activities of great&#13;
&#13;
importance. Simply putting the poverty issue on the map has&#13;
&#13;
done a tremendous amount. We can see it in a number of&#13;
&#13;
countries where the percentage of people in absolute poverty&#13;
&#13;
has dropped as the economy grew because of complementary&#13;
&#13;
measures by governments. We contributed the understanding of&#13;
&#13;
the population issue and the spread of family planning&#13;
&#13;
programs. We highlighted the importance of social safety&#13;
                                           '&#13;
nets, while substantially improving the targetting of&#13;
&#13;
subsidies on the neediest. Many nations increased their&#13;
&#13;
capacity to deliver social services to the poorest more&#13;
&#13;
effectively.&#13;

            On December 16 and 29, 1994, and January
            5, 1995, Ernest Stern was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske,
            Louis Galambos, and David Milobsky. During his tenure at the
            World Bank from 1968 to 1995, Mr. Stern worked in the
            following areas: for the Pearson commission as deputy to the
            executive secretary and staff director (1968-1972); in the
            office of the vice president as senior advisor for
            development policy (1972-1974) and as director (1974-1975);
            as vice president in the South Asia regional office
            (1975-1978) and in operations (1978-1980); as senior vice
            president in operations (1980-1987) and in finance
            (1987-1991); as a member of the policy committee (1987-1991)
            and as managing director (1991-1995). He helped supervise
            the preparation of the landmark first World Development
            Report in 1977. He discusses at length the United States
            International Cooperation Administration (ICA) and its
            subsequent change to the Agency for International
            Development (AID). His transcript also concerns the budget
            office, the staff association, and congressional approval.
