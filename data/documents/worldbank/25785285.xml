National Ratin and Award Scheme for&#13;
Sanitation for Indian Oties&#13;
Ministy of Urban Development, Government of Indi a                                    T&#13;
Goal&#13;
In order to rapidly promote sanitation in urban areas of the country (as provided for in the&#13;
National Urban Sanitation Policy and Goals 2008), and to recognize excellent performance in&#13;
this area, the Government of India intends to institute an annual rating award scheme for cities.&#13;
The award is based on the premise that improved public health and environmental standards&#13;
are the two outcomes that cities must seek to ensure for urban citizens. In doing so,&#13;
governments in states and urban areas will need to plan and implement holistic city-wide&#13;
sanitation plans, thereby put in place processes that help reach outputs pertaining to safe&#13;
collection, confinement and disposal (including conveyance, treatment, and/ or re-use without&#13;
adverse impacts on the environment in and around the cities). It may be noted that the awards&#13;
will not recognize mere inputs, hardware or expenditure incurred in urban sanitation but&#13;
assess how these lead to achievements of intermediate milestones toward the final result of&#13;
100 percent safe disposal of wastes from the city on a sustainable basis. Cities will need to&#13;
raise the awareness of city stakeholders (households, establishments, industries, municipal&#13;
functionaries, media, etc.) since improved sanitation can ensure improved public health and&#13;
environmental outcomes only if considerable changes in behavior and practice take place&#13;
across the spectrum of society.&#13;
Concept of Totally Sanitized Cities&#13;
A totally Sanitized City will be one that has achieved the outputs or milestones specified in the&#13;
National Urban Sanitation policy, the salient features of which are as follows:&#13;
* Cities must be open defecation free.&#13;
* Must eliminate the practice of manual scavenging and provide adequate personnel&#13;
protection equipment that addresses the safety of sanitation workers.&#13;
* Municipal wastewater and storm water drainage must be safely managed.&#13;
* Recycle and reuse of treated wastewater for non potable applications should be&#13;
implemented wherever possible.&#13;
*  Solid waste collected and disposed off fully and safely.&#13;
*  Services to the poor and systems for sustaining results.&#13;
N C&#13;
*Improved public health outcomes and environmental standards.              TOWARDS CITY WIDE SANITATION&#13;

ï»¿Rating and Categorization of Cities&#13;

indicators of outputs, processes and outcomes, as presented in Table 1.&#13;

AThe marks for the above indicators will be&#13;
revised every two to three years. Over time, indicators about more stringent&#13;
conditions e.g. no-urination, or spitting in open/public spaces, etc. will be introduced as indicators.&#13;
The weights accorded to each category and specific indicators will also be revised. ** In this context, bigger&#13;
cities may consider instituting good practice systems that comply with ISO (International Standards Organization) and/or BIS&#13;
(Bureau of Indian Standards) process systems.&#13;
On the basis of the above rating scheme, cities will be placed in different categories as presented in Table 2.&#13;
National rating survey data will utilize these categories for publication of results.&#13;

achievements may also be given special or&#13;

may also be considered for category-wise awards.&#13;
