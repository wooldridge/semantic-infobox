THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA&#13;
ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
l. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Slovenia is a former republic of Yugoslavia which became an independent state in 1991.&#13;
The country is situated on the south-eastern fringes of the Alps, bordered by Austria in the north,&#13;
Italy in the west, Hungary in the east, and Croatia in the south. Slovenia is one of the smallest&#13;
countries in Europe; with an area of 20,250 square kilometers it is about half the size of&#13;
Switzerland. The country has a population of about two million people and a relatively low&#13;
population density of about 97 persons per square kilometer, similar to France and about half that&#13;
of Great Britain. The capital city, Ljubljana, with a population of about 300,000, is the country's&#13;
largest city. The second largest city is Maribor, with a population of about 105,000 inhabitants.&#13;
2.    Economic Environment. With a per capita income of about US$7,000 in 1994, Slovenia&#13;
is the most prosperous country in the Central and East European region. The Slovene economy&#13;
is oriented towards services and manufacturing, with the service sector accounting for about 55&#13;
percent of total output, and industry accounting for about 30 percent. The economy relies heavily&#13;
on trade, with exports and imports each averaging over 60 percent of Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP) in recent years. Trade with the European Union accounts for about 60 % of Slovenia's&#13;
external trading volume.&#13;
3.    Slovenia's overall macroeconomic performance in recent years has been quite positive:&#13;
real GDP grew by 5.5 % and 5.0 % in 1994 and 1995 (estimate), respectively, compared to 1.0&#13;
% in 1993. Inflation was 8.6 % per annum in 1995. The recovery in investment and GDP has&#13;
been accompanied by current account surpluses of about 3 % of GDP in 1994 and 1995. Reserves&#13;
now comprise more than 4.5 months of imports.&#13;
4.    Slovenia, as one of the successors of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,&#13;
inherited that republic's portfolio of Bank loans of projects located within its boundaries. Of&#13;
these, only one loan for the Slovene Coast Water Supply and Sanitation Project remains ongoing.&#13;
Slovenia became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 1992, and a&#13;
member of the World Bank Group in February 1993, as a successor to membership of the former&#13;
Yugoslavia. Last year's staff report on Article IV consultations was discussed at the IMF Board&#13;
on September 1, 1995. Close cooperation has been maintained with IMF staff.&#13;
5.    The Bank's program of assistance to Slovenia focuses on the core of the Government's&#13;
structural reform program, i.e. reform of the enterprise and banking sectors and on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
environment. The Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL), the first and only&#13;
loan approved since independence, supports the Government's efforts in privatization of socially-&#13;
owned enterprises, governance reform of State-owned enterprises, bank restructuring and&#13;
privatization, enhancement of the regulatory framework for banking, labor market adjustment, and&#13;
strengthening of the social safety net. Overall implementation of the program supported by the&#13;
EFSAL progressed well, and the second tranche was released in December 1995. In addition, an&#13;
Investment Recovery Loan is currently under preparation by the Bank and is expected to be&#13;
negotiated soon.&#13;
6.    Because of its relatively high per capita income, and growing access to other sources of&#13;
international finance, the scope for World Bank support is being tailored to a few key areas where&#13;
the Slovenes consider the Bank's inputs to be particularly helpful (i.e. banking and environment).&#13;
A limited Country Assistance Strategy was included in the EFSAL President's Report dated June&#13;
22, 1993.&#13;
7.    In March of 1993 the Slovenian Government requested the Bank to cooperate in preparing&#13;
the Slovenia - Environment Project and to help fund an Air Pollution Abatement Program in major&#13;
Slovenian cities as well as a Geographical Information System. The Slovenia - Environment&#13;
Project is in line with the Bank's assistance strategy to focus on high-priority projects with strong&#13;
economic returns. Air pollution has been the highest priority area for the Slovenian Government&#13;
in the field of environmental protection. In addition, the project helps the country to develop and&#13;
strengthen an institution, the EcoFund, that will be active in dealing with environmental issues&#13;
in other sectors as well. Moreover, the project serves as a catalyst for activities to improve the&#13;
country's environment. European agencies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (EBRD) and the European Union (EU), are currently supporting the improvement&#13;
of Slovenia's environment to bring the country's environmental performance in line with Western&#13;
European countries. The EU, the British Know How Fund, the Austrian Government, USAID&#13;
and other bilateral and international donors have supported the preparation of this project.&#13;
8.    Documents and detailed information concerning the sector and the project are available in&#13;
the Project Files (Anne L1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A.    The Energy Sector in Slovenia&#13;
9.    Around two thirds of Slovenia's fossil fuel requirements are met by imports. Slovenia has&#13;
about 75 million tons of proven reserves of brown coal, 243 million tons of lignite and 35&#13;
thousand tons of uranium.  Oil and gas reserves are negligible.  Total primary energy&#13;
consumption was 6.24 million tons oil equivalent (mtoe) in 1988. Until 1992, it dropped by 18%&#13;
to 5 mtoe, mostly as a result of economic contraction in the wake of the transition to a market&#13;
economy, which needed to reorient itself after independence. Of 1992 total primary energy&#13;
consumption (after losses, which account for 40%) 38% went to industry, 38% to households and&#13;
small enterprises, and 23 % to the transport sector. Enterprises in the power subsector have been&#13;
reorganized into three separate groups: seven independent power generation enterprises; a holding&#13;
company (ELES) which owns the transmission grid and the distribution enterprises; and the&#13;
nuclear power plant (KRSKO) which is 50% owned by ELES and 50% by Croatia. The&#13;
enterprises for transmission and distribution of natural gas have also been reorganized and the&#13;
socially-owned shares of these enterprises are being privatized. A draft law on Production,&#13;
Transmission, and Distribution of Energy is near completion, and is currently being aligned with&#13;
European Union (EU) legislation. Two studies on the legal, regulatory, and institutional&#13;
framework of the power sector and on the regulatory framework of the gas subsector are nearly&#13;
completed.&#13;
10.   The Government has been implementing its "Strategy for Rational Use and Supply of&#13;
Energy in Slovenia" which calls for a 7 % real annual increase in power prices for the next few&#13;
years, with a view of achieving 80 % of average EU prices by 1998 and parity by the year 2000.&#13;
Power prices were increased twice in 1994 by a total of 25.2 % in nominal terms, and once in&#13;
April 1995, by 15 % in nominal terms. The Government increased power prices again in August&#13;
1995 by 7 % in nominal terms. As a result, Slovene power prices for industry and household are&#13;
currently at 73 % and 65% of the average EU prices, respectively. (The current power price&#13;
levels for industry are equal to those in France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Greece and higher&#13;
than in Sweden. Power prices for households are at the same level as those in Sweden.)&#13;
Enterprises in the power subsector and transmission and distribution of natural gas have been&#13;
reorganized, with the intent of eventual privatization. This process has started in the hydropower&#13;
sector.&#13;
B.    The Environment in Slovenia&#13;
11.   Slovenia's extensive areas of natural beauty, its well-preserved towns and cities, and its&#13;
location have made it a popular destination for tourists. Tourism is expected to grow rapidly over&#13;
the next decades as western Europeans seek new destinations and as Central and Eastern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Europeans enjoy rising incomes. Slovenia has abundant natural resources and a relatively&#13;
unspoiled environment. About 53 % of its territory is forested, well above the European average&#13;
of 33 %. The country has one national park, Triglav in the Julian Alps, which provides habitat&#13;
to several endangered species, including the ibex and the capercaillie. There are plans for several&#13;
more national parks in areas of particular natural beauty or to protect the habitat of endangered&#13;
species such as the European brown bear.&#13;
1.    Air Pollution&#13;
12.   Air pollution in towns and cities is the environmental problem causing the greatest health&#13;
and economic damage in Slovenia. In Slovenia, households and district heating plants still rely&#13;
heavily on mostly domestically produced high-sulfur brown coal to provide space heat and hot&#13;
water. Since few furnaces are equipped with air pollution control devices, the burning of coal&#13;
leads to high ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PMo,, particles equal to or below 10&#13;
microns in diameter) and sulfur dioxide in local air basins during the winter months. The worst&#13;
affected cities and towns include Maribor, Zagorje, Celje, Trbovlje, Hrastnik, Ljubljana&#13;
(inlcuding, among others, Domzale and Kamnik), Crna, Kranj, Ptuj, Krsko, Rogaska Slatina and&#13;
Jesenice.&#13;
13.   During the heating season -- which lasts from October to April -- peak 24-hour ambient&#13;
concentrations of PM1O can reach over 250 micrograms per cubic meter, and of sulfur dioxide&#13;
over 400 micrograms per cubic meter in the most polluted towns'. These levels considerably&#13;
exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) 24-hour guidelines of 125 micrograms per cubic&#13;
meter for both PM,O and sulfur dioxide2. (Slovenia has adopted the WHO standards for its own&#13;
air quality regulations.) Furthermore, 1-hour concentrations can easily exceed 1,000 micrograms&#13;
per cubic meter compared with the WHO guideline of 350 micrograms per cubic meter. However,&#13;
since non-heating season concentrations of PM,O and sulfur dioxide are very low -- 24-hour&#13;
concentrations average about 12 micrograms per cubic meter for PM,0 and about 25 micrograms&#13;
per cubic meter for sulfur dioxide -- annual averages are not especially high. Even in the worst&#13;
polluted cities and towns, annual averages for PM,o range between 20-70 micrograms per cubic&#13;
meter, and for sulfur dioxide between 30-75 micrograms per cubic meter, compared with the&#13;
I Fine particulate pollution is caused mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels, and typically contains a mixture of&#13;
soot, and sulfate and nitrate particles. Fine particles almost certainly pose a greater threat to health than larger&#13;
particles, since they are more likely to be toxic and can be breathed deeply into the lungs.&#13;
2 These levels also exceed European Union standards, which are 250 for PM,0 and between 250 and 350 for sulfur&#13;
dioxide depending on associated levels of PM,o.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
WHO standards of 50 micrograms per cubic meter for each. Nitrogen dioxide is not yet a&#13;
problem anywhere in Slovenia. Even in the worst-polluted cities, annual, 24-hour, and 1-hour&#13;
averages are well below levels thought to damage health, and nowhere exceed the WHO (or&#13;
European Union) guidelines3. Levels of nitrogen dioxide are likely to increase, however, as car-&#13;
ownership increases.&#13;
14.   Although annual averages are not particularly high, PM1O and sulfur dioxide in the ranges&#13;
found in Slovenia's most polluted cities and towns almost certainly cause considerable damage to&#13;
health. According to the best scientific evidence, most health damage from exposure to sulfur&#13;
dioxide is caused by brief exposures to high ambient concentrations (peak exposures), rather than&#13;
by long-term exposures to low annual means. For PMIO, both long-term and peak exposures can&#13;
damage health.&#13;
15.   Furthermore, recent epidemiological evidence has found associations between excess&#13;
mortality and exposures to PMIO at annual averages as low as 18 micrograms per cubic meter&#13;
(Dockery, et. al., 1993). These studies suggest that there may be no safe threshold levels below&#13;
which health damage does not occur and that the effects are linearily related to ambient&#13;
concentrations. The associations are strongest for inhalable particles (PM10), fine particles (equal&#13;
to or below 2.5 microns in diameter), and for sulfate particles4, and less strong for total suspended&#13;
particulates or sulfur dioxide.&#13;
16.   Annex L2  contains estimates of the reductions in mortality and morbidity that could be&#13;
expected from reducing air pollution in Maribor, one of the initial beneficiaries of the proposed&#13;
Bank loan, based on dose-response functions developed in North America and Western Europe.&#13;
17.   Point sources of air pollution. About 86 % of Slovenia's emissions of sulfur dioxioe&#13;
come from coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Slovenia's largest power plant, in&#13;
Sostanj, was responsible for almost half the country's total sulfur dioxide emissions in 1991.&#13;
However, emissions from this facility have been declining by 50 % since a flue gas desulfurization&#13;
unit (FGD) became operational in May 1995.&#13;
3  The European Union annual limit value for nitrogen dioxide is 200 micrograms per cubic meter. The EU has&#13;
not adopted a 24-hour or hourly standard. WHO has not suggested an annual guideline, but does have guidelines&#13;
of 150 and 400 micrograms per cubic meter for 24 hours and I hour respectively.&#13;
4  Sulfate particles are formed from sulfur dioxide. Reducing sulfur dioxide concentrations will also reduce this&#13;
damaging form of particulate matter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
18.   Although emissions from the Sostanj thermal power plant are still large, they do not cause&#13;
significant health damage. Because the tall stacks emit the sulfur dioxide far above the valley&#13;
floor where most people live and because the power plant supplies heat to households in the&#13;
nearby towns, air quality near the power plant is actually quite good. Concentrations of sulfur&#13;
dioxide and especially of PM1o are better than the national averages in the nearby town of Velenje.&#13;
The emissions of sulfur dioxide do damage the nearby forests, however, and contribute to long-&#13;
range acid depositions. A World Bank study estimated this damage to equal about 4 million DM&#13;
per year. However, reducing emissions from the Sostanj power plant below the 50 % reduction&#13;
already planned by installing a second FGD would cost about 17.5 million DM per year compared&#13;
to benefits of about 2 million DM (for more detail see Ayres and Dixon, 1995). Slovenia can&#13;
achieve significant health benefits, and at the same time reduce its countrywide emissions of sulfur&#13;
dioxide -- and acid depositions -- by investing instead in the replacement of polluting fuels by gas&#13;
in households and district heating plants.&#13;
19.   Two other large power plants, Ljubljana and Trbovlje, together were responsible for 13&#13;
% of total sulfur dioxide emissions in 1991. Still both power plants had reduced emissions&#13;
considerably over 1990 levels primarily by substituting imported low-sulfur coal (sulfur content&#13;
under 0.4 %) for the indigenous product (sulfur content up to 3 %). Emissions from Ljubljana&#13;
were 33 % lower in 1991 than 1990 and emissions from Trbovlje were 14 % lower.&#13;
2.    Water Pollution&#13;
20.   Nearly all Slovenia's drinking water comes from uncontaminated underground aquifers and&#13;
requires no treatment. However, in regions with intensive agricultural and livestock operations,&#13;
there is evidence that nitrates and pesticides sometimes leach into the groundwater. Levels at&#13;
most sampling points have remained below the European Union standards for drinking water.&#13;
However, concentrations appear to be increasing and there is concern that some aquifers may&#13;
become unusable for drinking water if this trend is not reversed. Industrial effluents have also&#13;
occasionally contaminated drinking water supplies. At present, neither bacteriological nor toxic&#13;
metal contamination of drinking water pose major problems.&#13;
21.   In most parts of the country there are abundant reserves of groundwater for the future.&#13;
However, there is a shortage of groundwater to serve the coastal towns, particularly during the&#13;
busy summer months. Slovenia is now exploring options to supply drinking water to the coast&#13;
from distant aquifers or to use surface water sources which must be treated.&#13;
22.   As in most countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Slovenia disposes much of its&#13;
domestic and industrial wastewaters directly into surface waters without treatment. As a result,&#13;
most of the country's rivers contain contaminated stretches downstream of municipal and&#13;
industrial sources. Slovenia's most polluted river, the Sava, flows through the most heavily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
populated areas, collecting municipal and industrial wastewater from the country's largest and&#13;
most industrial cities. The country's cleanest river, the Soca, originates in the Julian Alps and&#13;
flows through the lightly inhabited mountain region for most of its length.&#13;
23.   While surface water contamination is not currently a priority in Slovenia, it is likely to&#13;
become so in the future as water-based recreational activities, such as boating, fishing, and&#13;
swimming, increase. There is also a concern that contaminated surface waters may seep into&#13;
underground aquifers making them unfit for drinking water.&#13;
3.    Solid Wastes&#13;
24.   Disposal of solid and hazardous wastes will likely become a priority in the future. Landfill&#13;
capacity is extremely scarce, and local resistance is making it difficult to develop new capacity&#13;
for the future. Substantial illegal and uncontrolled dumping has taken place in the past. A master&#13;
plan for collecting and disposing of municipal and hazardous solid wastes is currently being&#13;
prepared with the assistance of the European Union.&#13;
4.    Administrative and Regulatory Framework&#13;
25.   When Slovenia achieved indepedence in 1991, the Ministry of Environment and Physical&#13;
Planning (MEPP) was a small organization with a staff of only five people. Still, between 1991&#13;
and 1993 the Ministry of Environment drafted a comprehensive Environmental Protection Act and&#13;
gained Parliamentary approval for it in June 1993. The implementation of this Act is placing&#13;
severe strains on the capacity of the Ministry. The Ministry will therefore need to establish&#13;
priorities and timetables to efficiently allocate resources for developing and implementing key&#13;
regulations and other measures.&#13;
26.   The policy-making team that will be primarily responsible for this work now consists of&#13;
16 members. Nonetheless, this team is greatly over-extended and is likely to become more so as&#13;
it starts to coordinate its work with other Government ministries and as it takes on new&#13;
responsibilities, especially in the context of the country's objective of joining the European Union&#13;
within a few years. The Ministry strengthened the permanent staff of the Ministry at a senior&#13;
level by appointing a secretary-general and managers responsible for financial matters and plans&#13;
to add staff for organizational matters (covering both the operations of the Ministry and its&#13;
affiliated bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Pollution Inspectorate).&#13;
27.   With an increasing number of projects under its management, including the proposed&#13;
Slovenia Environment Project, the Ministry recognizes the need to establish a Project&#13;
Implementation Team. Since the Environmental Fund of Slovenia (EcoFund) will be responsible&#13;
for identifying, appraising and implementing environmental projects, this Project Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Team will reside within the EcoFund and strengthen all of its activities. The staff of the Team will&#13;
include specialists in project management, procurement and financial management.&#13;
28.   In the past, many responsibilities in the field of environmental protection were devolved&#13;
to municipal and district governments or were fragmented between different Ministries and&#13;
agencies. A single Environmental Protection Agency has been established to coordinate and&#13;
oversee the detailed implementation of the regulatory framework specified in the Environmental&#13;
Protection Act. Unfortunately, the merger of the component organizations which make up the&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency caused severe disruption and demoralization among its staff,&#13;
partly as a result of a clash of cultures between senior staff trained under the old system and&#13;
younger but less experienced staff who are better attuned to the new role and responsibilities of&#13;
the Agency. The Ministry has plans to (a) establish an appropriate organizational structure for&#13;
the Agency; (b) define responsibilities and modes of operation; (c) develop appropriate links with&#13;
other Ministries and local governments; and (d) recruit and train additional staff to carry out the&#13;
Agency's functions.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
29.   The proposed Project would includes two major components: (a) the Air Pollution&#13;
Abatement Component; and (b) the Geographical Information System Component.&#13;
a.    Air Pollution Abatement Component. The Air Pollution Abatement Program&#13;
(APAP) assists households and boilerhouse operators in polluted cities in Slovenia&#13;
to convert all boilerhouses and households burning polluting fuels or heating&#13;
systems (coal, wood, other solid fuels, heavy fuel oil; short: polluting fuels) to use&#13;
cleaner fuels or heating systems (natural gas, district heating, liquid petroleum gas,&#13;
low sulphur oil, heat pumps, solar energy; short: cleaner fuels). The APAP&#13;
provides loans to households and boilerhouse operators to cover 80 % of the&#13;
conversion costs. A pilot phase for the APAP was completed in Maribor, the&#13;
second largest city in Slovenia, during the autumn of 1995. Based on lessons&#13;
learnt from this pilot phase, the APAP will become a self-sustaining revolving loan&#13;
fund (similar to the successful Slovenia housing fund) that will finance similar&#13;
projects in other polluted cities in Slovenia.&#13;
b.    Geographical Informatin Systm CoQmonen. The objective of the Geographical&#13;
Information System Component (GIS) is to collect, organize, and manage&#13;
information for improved development and land-use planning, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
areas that are experiencing rapid development.  It would also motivate&#13;
municipalities to build local GIS centers as a part of the national GIS&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
These components are described in detail below:&#13;
B.    Air Pollution Abatement Component (World Bank Loan of DM 30 MUlion equivalent)&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
30.   Maribor is Slovenia's second largest city, with a population of about 105,000 people living&#13;
in about 39,500 households. Although Maribor has both natural gas and district heating&#13;
distribution systems, over one-third of the households and boilerhouses burn coal or wood to&#13;
provide space heating and hot water. An additional 20 % of boilerhouses use high sulfur fuel oil&#13;
for energy. As a result, concentrations of particulates and sulfur dioxide are high during the&#13;
heating season, damaging health and the environment.&#13;
31.   Concern about local levels of air pollution prompted the Maribor City Council to adopt&#13;
regulations in 1992 designed to achieve the progressive conversion of all heating systems,&#13;
boilerhouses and households burning polluting fuels to uses of cleaner fuels. These regulations&#13;
set strict standards on smoke emissions from heating systems and boilers in heavily polluted areas&#13;
of the city, implying that household and large boilers currently burning coal, wood, or heavy fuel&#13;
oil should be converted if they were replaced or significantly modified.&#13;
32.   Since then, levels of air pollution have fallen but this has largely been the consequence of&#13;
a sequence of warm winters. The rate of conversions from polluting to cleaner fuels has been&#13;
disappointing with about 200 households a year converting from coal or wood to gas or other&#13;
cleaner fuels. Hence, the local administration and the national environmental authorities have&#13;
been exploring options for accelerating the transition to cleaner fuels.&#13;
33.   A market survey was carried out in North Maribor to investigate the costs of and possible&#13;
barriers to fuel conversion. This concluded that the technical and economic potential for&#13;
conversions5 was very high. The critical barrier to conversion was the high initial capital cost&#13;
required, for example, for connections to the gas pipeline and for the installation of gas-fired&#13;
heating equipment. (Details of the survey results are shown in Anne 11 Tabkl A3-1.3). To help&#13;
Conversion analyses often distinguish technical potential from economic potential. Technical potential is a&#13;
broader concept and includes all households that could reasonably consider converting their space heating system&#13;
to gas firing regardless of the relative cost of doing so. Economic potential is a subset of technical potential and&#13;
includes only those which are likely to convert.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
users switch to gas, the city provided low-interest loans through a local bank for a period. This&#13;
program was successful, but the limited funds available meant that the demand for loans greatly&#13;
exceeded the supply.&#13;
34.   In 1995 the Ministry of Environment promulgated a set of national emission standards for&#13;
small boilers and heating systems similar to those which had been introduced earlier in Maribor.&#13;
In order to accelerate the rate of conversions from polluting to cleaner fuels, the Ministry has&#13;
encouraged the EcoFund to introduce a program of conversion loans covering all of the most&#13;
polluted towns and cities in the country. To assist the EcoFund in their preparations for&#13;
negotiation, consultants prepared three alternate estimates of the potential loan volumes to finance&#13;
conversions of home heating systems to cleaner fuels in the six most polluted Slovenian cities.&#13;
The three alternate methods were selected to recognize the uncertainty in the data supporting any&#13;
single method. Assuming 75 % of total loan funding from the World Bank, the alternatives would&#13;
require WB loans of DM32.1 million, DM34.9 million and DM41.8 million. Based on these&#13;
findings, the study concluded that the Ecofund could plausibly expect to use a World Bank loan&#13;
of DM30.0 million to finance conversion in six cities over the next five years.&#13;
35.   Hence, the Bank's role in this Project has been to help develop an institutional mechanism&#13;
to assist in financing conversion without relying upon interest rate subsidies. This will enable the&#13;
program to be extended to all urban areas suffering from poor air quality. In turn the availability&#13;
of finance for conversion on reasonable terms will allow the environmental authorities to introduce&#13;
stricter air pollution controls and thus to accelerate the reduction in high levels of air pollution to&#13;
which many urban residents are exposed.&#13;
2.    Objective&#13;
36.   The objective of the Air Pollution Abatement Component is to reduce ambient&#13;
concentrations of PM1o and sulfur dioxide along with the health damage associated with exposure&#13;
to air pollution. The Project is designed to achieve this objective by providing loans to&#13;
households and boilerhouse operators to convert to clearner fuels from polluting fuels. An initial&#13;
phase in Maribor to establish the mechanism for administering the loans and to observe the rate&#13;
of conversion when such loans are made available has been completed. Thus, loans under the&#13;
Project will be offered for household and boilerhouse conversions in urban areas with&#13;
unacceptable levels of air pollution.&#13;
3.    Description&#13;
37.   The proposed Project, through the Air Pollution Abatement Program (APAP), will provide&#13;
fuel conversion loans to about 6,500 households and about 65 boilerhouse operators during the&#13;
three years over which the Bank loan will be disbursed. These loans will be used to finance the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
conversion of heating and hot water systems currently using polluting fuels to the use of cleaner&#13;
fuels. Taking account of the recycling of repayments to fund new loans, it is estimated that the&#13;
Project will finance the conversion of at least 12,000 households and 120 boilerhouses over a&#13;
period of 8 years.&#13;
38.   A pilot for the APAP was undertaken during the autumn of 1995 in order to test the&#13;
demand for conversion loans and to develop the institutional procedures for the full program.&#13;
Loans for the conversion of 193 households and 5 boilerhouses, amounting to approximately DM&#13;
1.5 million, were approved in a period of 3 months, despite the fact that the pilot occurred at the&#13;
beginning of the heating season so that many households had already made commitments for the&#13;
current year. A detailed evaluation of the pilot phase carried out in February 1996 showed that&#13;
the arrangements for handling loan applications and disbursements are satisfactory, though some&#13;
minor adjustments have been proposed and agreed. The EcoFund is now making the necessary&#13;
operational arrangements to extend the APAP to all of the urban areas to be covered by the&#13;
Project.&#13;
39.   The Air Pollution Abatement Program will operate as follows:&#13;
(a)   The Slovene EcoFund has established and will manage the Air Pollution Abatement&#13;
Program (APAP) drawing upon its own resources and the proceeds of the Bank loan.&#13;
Eligible cities would include those suffering from serious air pollution as listed below --&#13;
Annex J1A provides details on ambient air quality for 1990-95 in these towns and cities.&#13;
The list of eligible towns and cities will be reviewed in the course of a mid-term evaluation&#13;
of the component 12 months after the Project becomes effective. The following air basins&#13;
would be included in the APAP: Maribor, Zagorje, Celje, Trbovlje, Hrastnik, Ljubljana&#13;
(inlcuding, among others, Domzale and Kamnik), Crna, Kranj, Ptuj, Krsko, Rogaska&#13;
Slatina and Jesenice.&#13;
(b)   The EcoFund has sub-contracted the loan administration (processing of loan applications&#13;
for heating conversions, loan disbursement, and the administration of loan repayments) to&#13;
a commercial bank (financial agent). Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM) was selected&#13;
as the financial agent following a competitive procedure acceptable to the Bank. This&#13;
financial agent will be paid according to a fixed schedule of fees6. The EcoFund has&#13;
prepared an operating manual for the selected bank covering, inter alia, the eligibiity&#13;
of households and boilerhouse operators for sub-loans under the APAP, terms and&#13;
conditions of loan repayment, penalties for late payment, and the handling of&#13;
6   The Slovene Housing Fund, which makes loans to households acquiring their apartments under the privatization&#13;
program, provides a successful model for the operation of the APAP. Details of the schedule of fees are given&#13;
in Annex Table A4.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
defaults. This document is acceptable to the Bank. The Financial Administration&#13;
Agreement with the financial agent covered the pilot program already completed in&#13;
the autumn of 1995 and has been revised to cover the whole Program. The&#13;
performance of the financial agent will be assessed during the mid-term review. If this&#13;
performance is judged to have been unsatisfactory, then a new agent will be selected to&#13;
handle the remainder of the program on the basis of a competitive procedure acceptable&#13;
to the Bank. The auditors of the EcoFund will carry out a regular audit of the financial&#13;
position of the loan fund. The auditors of the financial agent will also carry out a regular&#13;
audit of the performance of the financial agent in processing loan applications and&#13;
administering repayments.&#13;
(c)   Sub-borrowers may borrow up to 80 % of the required conversion costs. Sub-loans will&#13;
be denominated in DM and loan accounts maintained in DM but all transactions will be&#13;
in the Slovenian Tolar equivalent of the relevant DM amount at the NKBM buying rate&#13;
prevailing on the day of the transaction. The sub-borrowers will, thus, carry the foreign&#13;
exchange risk on World Bank funds. This is normal practice in Slovenia where DM loans&#13;
for the purchase of cars and durables are a standard feature of bank lending to households.&#13;
(d)   Sub-loans will initially carry a DM interest rate of R+2 %, where R is the variable,&#13;
LIBOR-based interest rate charged by the Bank on DM single currency loans, and 2&#13;
percentage points is the initial interest margin to cover the fees and other expenses&#13;
incurred by the EcoFund. For the purposes of the analysis in this paper, the World Bank&#13;
LIBOR-based interest rate (R) has been taken as 4.75 %. The interest rate paid by sub-&#13;
borrowers will be adjusted every 6 months so that it reflects the interest rate R charged by&#13;
the World Bank for the current 6 month period. There are no subsidies implicit in the&#13;
design or operation of the APAP. With a fixed interest margin of about 2% over its cost&#13;
of funds, the financial projections for the APAP suggest that the EcoFund would generate&#13;
a substantial net surplus on income account over the life of the project. However, a larger&#13;
interest margin is required initially to cover the start-up costs of the APAP, to reduce the&#13;
period during which there is a deficit on income account, and to provide reserves against&#13;
unforeseen costs and/or losses. It has been agreed that the interest margin will be&#13;
reviewed annually and that it will be adjusted downwards to ensure that the net surplus on&#13;
income account over the life of the APAP does not exceed DM 1 million.&#13;
(e)   The term of the sub-loans will depend on the nature of the conversion. Sub-loans for&#13;
boilerhouse conversions will have a term of up to 10 years. Loans to households will have&#13;
a maximum term of up to 6 years, though sub-borrowers may chose to repay their loans&#13;
over a shorter period if they wish. The sub-loan conditions have been designed so that&#13;
monthly payments should not amount to more than 5 % of the after-tax monthly income of&#13;
a household with two wage-earners -- the typical situation. These terms would be more&#13;
attractive than those offered by Slovene banks, since Slovene banks currently offer loans&#13;
for home improvements at a real interest rate of about 14 % (in SIT) for a maximum of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
three years.&#13;
(f)    All sub-loans will be insured or guaranteed against default either by an insurance company&#13;
in the case of household loans or by municipalities (or other guarantors or insurance in&#13;
accordance with normal banking practice) in the case of boilerhouse loans. Thus, the&#13;
EcoFund, through the APAP, is taking no credit risk and the default rate on loans is&#13;
assumed to be zero -- again this follows the practice adopted by the Slovene Housing&#13;
Fund. The contract with the financial agent specifies the actions to be taken by the agent&#13;
in respect of delinquent accounts before the sub-loan is declared in default and the&#13;
insurance or guarantee is invoked. The cost of undertaking these steps ensures that the&#13;
financial agent has an incentive to bring delinquent accounts up to date as rapidly as&#13;
possible. Further, it provides an incentive for the agent to collect monthly payments via&#13;
payroll deduction. This is the standard method of servicing housing and consumer loans&#13;
in Slovenia and the mechanisms are well established and operates efficiently.&#13;
(g)   Household sub-borrowers will be responsible for paying the sub-loan insurance fee -- set&#13;
at 1.84 % of the sub-loan value for loan terms up to 3 years and 2.5 % of the sub-loan&#13;
value for loan terms of 3-6 years under the present insurance agreement -- to the insurance&#13;
company through the financial agent when their sub-loan is approved. In addition, they&#13;
will pay a one-time sub-loan origination fee of DM 75 (about 1.5% of the average sub-&#13;
loan value) to the financial agent. Boilerhouse operators will pay a onetime sub-loan&#13;
origination fee of DM 150 to the financial agent. In addition, they will be responsible for&#13;
the cost of providing a satisfactory guarantee or sub-loan insurance.&#13;
(h)   Sub-borrowers will pay to the financial agent annual sub-loan administration fees of DM&#13;
55 for household conversion sub-loans and DM 115 for boilerhouse conversion sub-loans.&#13;
(i)    Taking account of sub-loan origination and insurance/guarantee fees the total annualized&#13;
cost of the fuel conversion sub-loans to households would be equivalent to an interest rate&#13;
of 7-8 % per year, depending upon the sub-loan term chosen by the sub-borrower.&#13;
(j)    Based on the results of the market survey in Maribor and cost estimates prepared by&#13;
consultants it has been assumed that the average sub-loan size over the 4 years of the&#13;
project will be DM 5,000 for household conversion sub-loans and DM 120,000 for&#13;
boilerhouse conversion sub-loans. These estimates are averages over the total sub-loan&#13;
portfolio since conversion costs differ substantially according to the type of fuel currently&#13;
used, the fuel chosen for the new installation, and the size of the boiler required -- see&#13;
Annex i1L Tabk 3A14. They allow for a low rate of inflation (2-3 % p.a.) in DM over&#13;
the period of the project.&#13;
(k)   The proceeds of the Bank loan in support of the Air Pollution Abatement Program will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
drawn down over a period of 4 years to finance 75 % of funds lent under the program.&#13;
The EcoFund will finance the remaining 25 % of funds lent from its own resources. In&#13;
preparing the financial analysis it has been assumed that the interest rate charged on the&#13;
funds provided by the EcoFund will be the same as that charged on the Bank loan. These&#13;
funds will be repaid in 10 equal installments starting after the lending program ends, i.e.&#13;
in year 9.  As specified in the agreement with the financial agent, any reserves&#13;
accumulated by the APAP -- whether on capital or income account -- will earn an interest&#13;
rate equal to the DM LIBOR rate. The EcoFund has also agreed to provide working&#13;
capital of DM 500,000 to finance the deficit on income account that will arise in the early&#13;
years of the Program. This float will be repaid as soon as the APAP has established&#13;
adequate reserves on its income account.&#13;
40.   The results of surveys and of the pilot in Maribor have shown that households and&#13;
boilerhouse operators are likely to respond strongly to the APAP loan program. The sub-loan&#13;
terms have been structured so that the typical household borrower would have to make a down&#13;
payment of the equivalent of about DM 1,250 and pay about DM 60 per month over a period of&#13;
6 years to service an APAP loan which covers 80% of the conversion costs. In the market&#13;
surveys carried out in Maribor during Project preparation, households were asked the maximum&#13;
they would be willing to pay for a down payment and per month for the costs of converting to a&#13;
cleaner fuel. About 60 % of households indicated they would be willing to pay a maximum of&#13;
DM 1,000 for a down payment and about DM 110 as a monthly payment. The slightly higher&#13;
down payment is offset by the lower monthly payment over a period of only 6 years, so that it is&#13;
reasonable to assume that the response to the loans will be at least as high as that indicated by the&#13;
survey. The experience of the Maribor Gas Company, the Maribor District Heating Company,&#13;
and a local loan program organized in Celje support this conclusion. Hence, in preparing the&#13;
economic and financial analysis of the program it has been assumed that at least 50 % of the&#13;
households eligible to obtain conversion loans will actually do so within a period of 4 years.&#13;
Since the municipalities eligible for APAP sub-loans have a total population of over 750,000, the&#13;
EcoFund considers that the demand for sub-loans will exhaust the funds available within a period&#13;
of 3 years.&#13;
41.   The EcoFund, working with municipal authorities in the towns and cities covered by the&#13;
program, will be responsible for developing and carrying out a public information and marketing&#13;
campaign designed to encourage potential gas or district heating users to convert. This would&#13;
provide information on the costs of alternative heating systems, the environmental benefits of&#13;
using cleaner fuels, and the availability of loans to finance heating conversion. The costs of this&#13;
campaign would be met out of the budget set aside for the APAP's operating expenses and&#13;
financed initially by the working capital provided by the EcoFund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
C.    Geographical Information System Component (World Bank Loan of DM4.6 Million&#13;
equivalent)&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
42.   In 1991, the Government of Slovenia decided to establish and develop  a national&#13;
Geographical Information Center (GIC) within the MEPP to manage a Geographical Information&#13;
System (GIS). The GIS will comprise existing and new databases, containing basic geographic,&#13;
geological, topographic, economic and land ownership information and other databases-- the key&#13;
information to be used for future land-use planning in the country. The GIS component of the&#13;
proposed Project will assist in developing the GIC. The Project will focus primarily on priority&#13;
areas in the Koper, Maribor and Ljubljana regions, which are the regions in Slovenia undergoing&#13;
the most rapid development. The Project will also partially support other municipalities, which&#13;
are in parallel starting to develop geoinformation infrastructure and are in the context of the&#13;
national geoinformation infrastructure.  The GIS will be owned by the Government, and&#13;
administered by the GIC. The GIC will implement, operate and control the GIS computer&#13;
network. The GIC will provide fee-based services to all users.&#13;
2.    Objectives&#13;
43.   The main objective of the GIS component of the Project is to collect, organize, and manage&#13;
information for development and land-use planning, particularly in areas of Slovenia that are&#13;
experiencing rapid development. The project will provide hardware and software, technical&#13;
assistance, consultant services and training. The project will develop standards for establishing&#13;
data sets of basic geometry, land cadastre and other necessary data sets. The project will develop&#13;
the GIC of MEPP as a metadatabase server and standardized procedures of delivering information&#13;
and data to users. The project will establish procedures of use of these data in the field of land&#13;
use planning and environment protection. The information organized and managed by the GIC&#13;
would be used, inter alia, to:&#13;
a.    support, monitor and enforce the "Environmental Protection Act" passed in June&#13;
1994, and the associated environmental impact regulatory policies and procedures;&#13;
b.    support the current and the pending "Spatial Planning and Construction Building&#13;
Act" and the associated environmental/construction policies and procedures;&#13;
c.    facilitate domestic and international investments in Slovenia by making the spatial&#13;
planning and development approval processes quicker, more transparent, and less&#13;
arbitrary;&#13;
d.    increase reliability, acceptance and creditability of land cadastres;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
e.    facilitate the enforcement of regulatory processes and procedures;&#13;
f.    help develop and enforce a system of taxation or royalty and of the collection or&#13;
leasing for the use of natural resources and properties.&#13;
3.    Description&#13;
44.  The GIS component of the Project includes:&#13;
a.    The establishment of a central Geographic Information Center (GIC) in Ljubljana.&#13;
The GIC will establish a computer supported metadatabase system to be able to&#13;
distribute information on spatial databases to users. The GIC will contain a scalable&#13;
server (UNIX type), computer hardware and software for data capturing and&#13;
editing, and network systems to support high speed communications with other&#13;
regions of Slovenia (ethernet routers and modems).&#13;
b.    The establishment of a market development group to promote the use of the GIS,&#13;
to provide training (in the use of GIS), to raise market awarness on exchange of data&#13;
and to provide assistance to regional administrations, government agencies and&#13;
departments, and domestic and foreign industrial, commercial and service users.&#13;
c.    The establishment of formal standards (in line with international standards) on data&#13;
collection, use and maintenance of data and a quality assurance compliance group&#13;
to ensure that the information system operates in accordance with international&#13;
standards for data communication, data processing, etc.&#13;
d.    The establishment of a local training center, in cooperation with an experienced&#13;
international geomatics organization, with the authority to grant certifications in GIS&#13;
that are internationally recognized. The training center will operate in cooperation&#13;
with local universities. The purpose of the training center is to develop local&#13;
expertise in the operation of GIS.&#13;
45.  Project Scope. The MEPP has identified three priority areas and, within those areas,&#13;
development "islands," which comprise the areas in Slovenia expected to be under the greatest&#13;
development pressure in the future. During its first phase, the GIS will cover only the&#13;
development "islands." The priority areas are:&#13;
a.    Koper area. This coastal area is expected to experience rapid growth over the&#13;
next decades as the planned highway between Koper and Ljubljana is completed,&#13;
and as foreign investment flows into the duty-free zones created around the city.&#13;
The Koper authorities have already established a GIS for the region and have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
gained experience in the technical, marketing, financial, and data collection areas&#13;
of GIS. About 60 % of the data for this region has already been collected,&#13;
processed, and entered into the database. Proceeds from the proposed loan will be&#13;
used to complete this work and to integrate it into an interactive graphic GIS&#13;
database system.&#13;
b.    Maribor and Ljubljana areas, selected because these two cities are the two largest&#13;
urban and industrial areas in Slovenia.&#13;
c.    Other municipalities like Novo Mesto, Nova Gorica and Kranj are financing&#13;
similar projects within the strategy of National Geoinformation Infrastructure&#13;
(NGII). GIC will support them by partially investing in the communication&#13;
network and also in hardware and software and databases to speed up the process&#13;
and to spread the NGII. MEPP funds will be used in these other municipalities.&#13;
46.  These priority areas comprise about 40 % of the land area in Slovenia. Tie development&#13;
"islands" cover about 10 % of the priority areas or about 4 % of the territory of S!ovenia. The&#13;
cost of covering all the priority areas will be much higher, but would not provide significantly&#13;
higher benefits. It is expected that the municipalities included in the project will invest additional&#13;
funds to speed up the use of the GIS.&#13;
D.   Project Costs&#13;
47.  The total cost of the Environment Project is estimated at about DM 55.4 million, including&#13;
taxes and duties. No physical or price contingencies have been included for the APA component&#13;
since this will operate as a line of credit, but inflation has been allowed for, in estimating the&#13;
average conversion costs and loans for household and boilerhouse conversions as described in&#13;
paragraph 390). For the GIS compoment, the total project cost of DM 5.4 include physical&#13;
contingencies (of 3%) and price contingencies (of 10% of the local base cost and 2% of the&#13;
foreign exchange cost). The foreign exchange component is estimated at about DM 34.6 million,&#13;
including contingencies, or about 62% of the Project cost. (For detailed cost estimates, see&#13;
Annex L.) The total Project cost includes the following:&#13;
(a)   APA Component. The Project cost estimates include approximately 6,500 sub-&#13;
projects to households of an average size of DM 6,250 each and about 65 sub-&#13;
projects of boilerhouse operators of an average size of DM 150,000 each. The&#13;
funds provided by the EcoFund would cover for the costs of labor, material,&#13;
equipment and small associated civil works for the conversions.&#13;
(b)   GIS Component.  The Project cost estimates include the costs of computer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
hardware and software for expanding and upgrading the Slovene Geographical&#13;
Information System, consulting services for collecting and inputting data, training&#13;
of the MEPP staff in GIS operations, and consultant services, including both&#13;
international and national consultants to assist the GIS staff of MEPP in&#13;
information collection, management and decision making. It is estimated that the&#13;
GIS Component would cost about DM5.4 million of which about DM4.6 million&#13;
would be covered by the World Bank loan. Funds from the World Bank loan&#13;
would cover the costs of (i) foreign consulting services required for management&#13;
of the projects and in the field of standardization, data collection and strategic&#13;
decision making, (ii) local consulting services required for detailed definition and&#13;
development of standards and procedures, (iii) data collection, (iv) software and&#13;
hardware, and (v) training.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
48.  The proposed Bank loans of a total of DM 34.6 million will finance 60 % jf the total cost&#13;
of APA Component, and about 84% of the total cost of GIS Component. For the APA&#13;
Component, the beneficiaries would provide 20 % of the conversion cost as owner equity; the&#13;
EcoFund would contribute 25 % of the debt financing and the World bank loan would be used&#13;
for 75 % of the debt financing. The MEPP would finance 16% of the GIS Component (see&#13;
Annex 3.2 for details).&#13;
F.   Environmental Impact&#13;
49.  The Project would result in improved air quality in Maribor and other polluted cities and&#13;
reduced damage to health of their inhabitants. A safety audit has been carried out of the natural&#13;
gas utilities in Maribor and other towns to ensure that their operational procedures and safety&#13;
standards are satisfactory. This audit found these were at least as good as, and in some cases&#13;
more stringent than the standards in West European countries. The natural gas companies will&#13;
work closely with households and boilerhouse operators to assure that gas appliances are installed&#13;
and operated safely and that gas leaks or other problems are attended to by professionals rapidly&#13;
and effectively. With regard to Bank Guidelines, the project has been classified as a Category&#13;
C Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   The Borrowers and Beneficiaries&#13;
1.    The APA Component&#13;
50.  The borrower of the World Bank loan for the APA component would be the Environmental&#13;
Fund of Slovenia (EcoFund). A Project Implementation Team (PIT), within the EcoFund, would&#13;
be responsible for administering the APAP.&#13;
51.  Introduction. The EcoFund was founded on the day of enactment of the Environmental&#13;
Protection Act (July 2, 1993) and its operation was formally defined under Statutes passed by the&#13;
Slovenian Government based on article 86 of the above Act on July 25, 1994. These Statutes&#13;
are the basis for the Fund's existence and outline its objectives, a description of the organization,&#13;
operations, and financial issues. The Fund is designed as a legally and administratively&#13;
independent institution. It has been created by and under the direction of the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Physical Planning that gives continued policy guidance for the Fund's&#13;
operations. An Advisory Committee of the Parliament serves to review the Fund's activities.&#13;
52.  Operations of the EcoFund. Two main areas of Fund operations are (i) the provision of&#13;
loans to environmental investments at low interest rates that cover the Fund's operating costs but&#13;
don't generate profits (basic area of operation); and (ii) activities the Fund carries out on behalf&#13;
of others that are expected to generate profits (financial intermediation). Basic Fund operations&#13;
are guided by the environmental priorities of the MEPP. According to the Statutes of the Fund,&#13;
credits will be concentrated on state and municipal environmental services, and -wfllbe provided&#13;
directly from the Fund and secured by state and municipal guarantees. Internally the EcoFund&#13;
is governed by a Board of Directors and a Director under whom there will be three principal&#13;
areas: Project Preparation, Project Implementation and Finance.  Expert consultants in&#13;
accounting and environment will be utilized in the early stages of the EcoFund before&#13;
determining if full time assistance is required. Local commercial banking institutions will&#13;
administer the EcoFund's loans.  They will process the borrowers' applications, loan&#13;
disbursements and repayments.&#13;
53. Financial Status of the EcoFund. The EcoFund was capitalized by initial share capital&#13;
in the amount of SIT 10 million (US$ 86,000, DM 129,000); and the portfolio of loans&#13;
previously managed by the MEPP. Currently, the EcoFund capital is estimated at SIT 2,032&#13;
million (US$ 16.8 million, DM 25.2 million). The following table shows the balance sheet of&#13;
the EcoFund as of December 31, 1994.&#13;

54.  In 1995, additional outstanding receivables from loans in the amount of 1,177 million SIT&#13;
according to paragraph 4 of article 108 of the Environmental Protection Law were transferred&#13;
to the Fund. Additional assets of 35 million SIT from special taxes for unlawful land use and&#13;
708 million SIT from proceeds under the privatization law were obtained by the Fund. In total,&#13;
the EcoFund received 1,920 million SIT (around US$ 16 million or DM 23 million) in 1995.&#13;
On its annual meeting in 1996, the Board of Directors of the Fund will make a decision on the&#13;
allocation of this money.&#13;
55.   Presently, all shares are held by the Republic of Slovenia, however, other parties can gain&#13;
ownership up to 33 % of the capital by buying new shares (the new shares don't come with the&#13;
right to manage the EcoFund). The EcoFund has received additional substantial commitments&#13;
(by, fo. example, the Environmental Protection Act) that could increase substantially the capital&#13;
base of the fund before 1998, according the Board of Directors of the Fund. This money is&#13;
anticipated to come mainly from proceeds from privatization, retroactive fees on "illegal"&#13;
construction, concessions for waste management services and the state budget.&#13;
56.  Beneficiaries. The beneficiaries of the Air Pollution Abatement Component of the Project&#13;
would be households and boilerhouse operators or operators (among them also institutions like&#13;
schools, hospitals and companies), who receive loans under the APAP to convert from polluting&#13;
fuels to cleaner fuels. These households and boilerhouse operators would benefit directly from&#13;
a reduction in their heating costs, including the time and inconvenience involved in operating&#13;
coal and wood fired facilities. All residents of polluted cities -- including those not taking loans&#13;
-- will benefit from improvements in ambient air quality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
2.    The GIS Component&#13;
57.  The borrower would be the Republic of Slovenia through Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Physical Planning (MEPP). Beneficiaries would be the MEPP and the towns and regions&#13;
involved in the GIS process.&#13;
B.   The World Bank Loans&#13;
58.  The Bank loans totaling DM 34.6 million would be made to (i) the EcoFund for the APA&#13;
Component (DM30 million) with the guarantee of the Republic of Slovenia and to (ii) the&#13;
Republic of Slovenia, represented by the MEPP for the GIS Component (DM 4.6 million).&#13;
59. The World Bank loans will be London Inter-Bank Rate (LIBOR)-based single currency&#13;
loans denominated in DM with a maturity of 15 years with 5 years grace period for level&#13;
repayment of principal. The lending rate is reset every six month and consist of a Base Rate and&#13;
a Total Spread. This is announced by the Bank in January and July each year, and will apply to&#13;
all debt service (of such a Single Currency Loan) periods commencing in the semester in which&#13;
it is announced. The Repayment dates for single currency loans are the 15th day of&#13;
December and June for the APA Component and the 15th day of August and February for&#13;
the GIC Component.&#13;
C. Management and Implementation&#13;
60.   The Project would be implemented over a five-year period (1996 to 2000). The EcoFund&#13;
would have overall responsibility for implementing the APA Component. The MEPP through&#13;
GIC would implement the GIS Component.  The EcoFund has established a Project&#13;
Implementation Team (PIT) which consists of the senior EcoFund staff with substantial&#13;
experience in Project implementation, including Bank-financed projects. The Director of the&#13;
EcoFund would be responsible, as Project Director, for the implementation of the APA&#13;
Component. He would be assisted by three assistant directors of the EcoFund, who would be&#13;
responsible for supervising the financial agent (para 39 (b)) subcontracted to handle sub-loan&#13;
administration; procurement; financial matters and general administration. A small PIT in the&#13;
MEPP would be responsible for the implementation of the GIS Component. During&#13;
negotiations, the EcoFund and the MEPP have confirmed that, as conditions of effectiveness&#13;
of the World Bank loans, they will strengthen their respective PIT and will have appointed&#13;
staff for the PITs whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment&#13;
are satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
61.   The Project would require about 41 weeks of Bank supervision during the four years of&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
D.   Procurement&#13;
62.   The procurement arrangements are shown in Table 1.5 of the Project Implementation Plan&#13;
(PIP)(Anne  j2).  Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines dated January 1995, and Consultant Guidelines dated August 1981. A&#13;
component-by-component summary of the procurement arrangements is given below:&#13;
(a)   Air Pollution Abatement Component. During the life of the Project, the EcoFund&#13;
would make approximately 6,500 sub-loans to households and 65 sub-loans to&#13;
boilerhouse operators from the proceeds of the World Bank loan. The average&#13;
size of the sub-loans to households would be DM 5,000 each and to boilerhouse&#13;
operators DM 120,000 each covering labor, material and equipment. The Bank&#13;
has established that the labor, material and equipment needed for the conversion&#13;
are available from several sources in Slovenia and that there is sufficient&#13;
competition among suppliers. The Bank has also established that households&#13;
normally compare prices from several sources and take into account the quality&#13;
and performance of equipment. Consequently, the households would be allowed&#13;
to procure the necessary labor, equipment and material using these practices.&#13;
Private operators of boilerhouses follow established commercial practices for&#13;
purchases. These commercial practices involve obtaining quotations from several&#13;
suppliers and purchasing the equipment on the basis of its price and performance.&#13;
Public operators of boilerhouses are subject to and would follow the tendering&#13;
procedure provided for in the Public Procurement Decree of May 1993. The&#13;
financial agent, that would, together with the EcoFund, verify that the prices&#13;
obtained both by the households and the boilerhouse operators reflect current&#13;
market prices.&#13;
(b)   Geographical Information System Component. For the GIS Component, the&#13;
MEPP would procure computer hardware and software using the following&#13;
procurement methods: International Shopping (2 packages at a total estimated cost&#13;
of about DM 300,000); Direct Contracting because of upgrading and compatibility&#13;
(4 packages at a total estimated cost of about DM 300,000); consultant services&#13;
including six assignments, at an estimated cost of DM 4.7 million; and funds of&#13;
the MEPP of DM 500.000 to support other municipalities. The MEPP, which has&#13;
nominated a GIS expert to be the component manager, would nominate a small&#13;
PIT, supported by Ministry of Finance and hired consultants, to perform&#13;
procurement activities for this component.&#13;
E.   Disbursements&#13;
63.   The World Bank loan for the proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
of five years (1996 - 2000). This is possible because of the strong implementation capacity of&#13;
the EcoFund, including the PIT and the financial agent (FA). The Project completion date would&#13;
be December 31, 2000 and the closing date would be June 30, 2001. A summary of the&#13;
disbursement plan is included as Table 1.6 of the PIP. A detailed disbursement plan is also&#13;
included in the PIP (Annex  2).&#13;
64.   To facilitate timely project implementation, the EcoFund would establish, maintain and&#13;
operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in Deutsche Mark. During&#13;
the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to DM&#13;
4 million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level&#13;
of DM 5 million, the initial allocation my be increased up to the authorized allocation of DM 6&#13;
million by submitting the relevant application for withdrawal. Replenishment applications should&#13;
be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well&#13;
as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
65.   Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for goods and&#13;
services up to DM 400,000 equivalent per sub-loan for which detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures will be reviewed and kept by PIT and made available for the required audit as well&#13;
as to Bank supervision missions.&#13;
F.   Auditing&#13;
66.   Separate accounts, maintained by the financial agent on behalf of the EcoFund for the&#13;
APA component and by the Ministry of Finance for the GIS component, will be used to record&#13;
all Project expenditures from local and foreign funds. These accounts, including the SOEs as&#13;
well as the Special Account will be audited each year by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The auditors' reports would be received in the Bank within six months of the end of each&#13;
financial year. In this context, the EcoFund will require the financial agent to carry out an audit&#13;
of the APAP-related activities. This information will be part of the Annual Audit Report. In&#13;
addition, the EcoFund will have its accounts audited annually within 6 months after the&#13;
completion of each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank and transmit&#13;
the results of the audit to the Bank. The arrangements for accounting and auditing have&#13;
been agreed upon during negotiations (details are discussed in the PIP in Annex L2).&#13;
G.   Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
67.   The PIT will establish monitoring procedures in collaboration with the financial agent for&#13;
the APA Component and a small PIT in the MEPP will do the same for the GIS Component.&#13;
These monitoring procedures were prepared and tested in the Maribor pilot phase and have been&#13;
submitted to the Bank as the Operational Manual for review. The PIT will also prepare semi-&#13;
annual descriptive and financial reports on each Project component including objectives and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
activities (beginning from the date of Loan Effectiveness). These progress reports will be based&#13;
on similar semi-annual reports from the financial agent for The APA Component and the MEPP&#13;
for the GIS Component. Annual reporting will include a three-year-rolling financial forecast with&#13;
projected income statements, balance sheets and fund-flow statements for the EcoFund&#13;
operations. A mid-term review of the Project will be carried out by January/February 1998.&#13;
The PIP shows the detailed plan for Project reporting and annual supervision. Annex 3 3 shows&#13;
a draft list of Monitoring indicators and forecasts which have been agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
H.   Status of Project Preparation&#13;
68.   The pilot phase of the Air Pollution Abatement Program has been successfully completed&#13;
and its results used to update the financial projections for the program and the economic analysis&#13;
of its costs and benefits. The review of the pilot phase confirmed that the potential demand for&#13;
sub-loans is such that about 6,500 household heating systems and about 65 boilerhouses will be&#13;
converted during the first 3-4 years of the APAP. A financial agent, satisfactory to the Bank and&#13;
in good standing with the Bank of Slovenia, has been appointed to ensure sound financial&#13;
management and the timely flow of funds to and from the beneficiaries. For the GIS Component,&#13;
decisions on the type of GIS technology to be used and the consultant assignments needed have&#13;
been made, and procurement documents (especially technical specifications) are under&#13;
preparation. Implementation responsibilities have been defined and the implementation staff are&#13;
in place. The PIP includes a detailed description of the project implementation responsibilities.&#13;
L.    Financial Aspects of the Air Pollution Abatement Program&#13;
69.   A financial analysis of the APAP has been carried out for an eight-year loan program, for&#13;
the years 1996-2003. The volume of lending in each year is determined partly by the anticipated&#13;
demand for sub-loans and partly on the amounts of funds available from repayments once the&#13;
World Bank loan has been fully disbursed. The World Bank loan (DM 30 million) will&#13;
supplement the EcoFund's own resources of DM 10 million. Thus, until the Bank loan is fully&#13;
disbursed, the lending program is financed 75% from the Bank loan and 25% (DM 10 million)&#13;
from the EcoFund. The analysis further assumes that the APAP is wound up as soon as the loans&#13;
that it has extended and those that it has received are repaid. The detailed financial projections&#13;
are shown in Annex 42 Talek A4-2.2.&#13;
70.   For simplicity, the financial analysis has been carried out on a semi-annual basis by&#13;
assuming that loan and other disbursements occur at the end of the 6 month period in which they&#13;
are booked. The analysis shows that except for temporary shortfalls (para 71) the APAP can&#13;
easily cover operating expenses and other costs with an interest margin of 2 % per annum.&#13;
71.   The financial analysis projects capital reserves and accumulated income balances for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
APAP as if the program were to be operated as a completely independent entity. The analysis&#13;
indicates that the program will have ample reserves to meet repayment obligations on the World&#13;
Bank and EcoFund loans. In only two years -- years 4 and 5 -- does the total level of reserves&#13;
at the end of the year fall below the loan service and repayment obligations for the following&#13;
year. Since the bulk of sub-loans have a short loan period, annual cash flow from loan&#13;
repayments is high relative to loan service and repayment obligations. The consequence is that&#13;
the level of reserves relative to loan service and repayment obligations can easily be maintained&#13;
by making appropriate adjustments to the volume of new lending in any year. Thus, subject to&#13;
the provisions in paragraph 72 below, the APAP should increase the liquidity of the EcoFund&#13;
and will not pose any threat to its financial stability.&#13;
72.   For the first 2 or 3 years of its operations, the APAP might have an accumulated loss on&#13;
its pro-forma income account. Under the scenario of stable interest rates analysed in the main&#13;
financial projections this accumulated loss will never exceed DM 300,000. However, there is&#13;
a very small risk of a temporary mismatch between borrowing and lending rates if interest rates&#13;
rise very suddenly because of the timing of the Bank's notification of its LIBOR-based interest&#13;
rate for the current 6 month period. This takes place 15 days after the beginning of the period&#13;
based on the LIBOR rate on the first day of the period. Administratively, the financial agent may&#13;
require up to 15 days to recalculate loan repayments, notify sub-borrowers of the sums payable,&#13;
and to arrange for the appropriate payroll deduction in the case of household borrowers. Under&#13;
the worst case scenario this will involve a 1 month delay in adjusting the payments made by sub-&#13;
borrowers and even this can be avoided by making a provisional adjustment in the lending rate&#13;
which will be corrected one month later once the true rate for the period has been fixed. Simple&#13;
experiments with the financial model have indicated that financing of up to DM 0.5 million will&#13;
provide ample reserves to cover the accumulated deficit on income account and any possible&#13;
income shortfall arising from a brief mismatch of borrowing and lending rates. The EcoFund&#13;
has undertaken to make available financing of DM 0.5 million to cover the accumulated loss on&#13;
income account for the Air Pollution Abatement Program. This amount represents about 2 % of&#13;
EcoFund's equity and can easily be accommodated.&#13;
73.   Retroactive rmfancing will be available in an aggregate amount not exceeding the&#13;
equivalent of DM 3,000,000, for Subloans under the APA-Program before March 7, 1996, but&#13;
after July 1, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    APA Component: Economic Analysis and Benefits&#13;
74.   In the towns and cities average ambient concentrations of particulates and sulfur dioxide&#13;
during the heating season exceed those during the non-heating season by at least 20 micrograms&#13;
per cubic meter and the differential exceeds 40 micrograms per cubic meter for the most heavily&#13;
polluted areas. Hence, if all of the units burning polluting fuels are converted to cleaner fuels,&#13;
average annual concentrations should decline by at least 10 micrograms per cubic meter and the&#13;
decline may be as high as 20 micrograms per cubic meter in some areas. This will benefit all&#13;
of those living in the air basins affected by the emissions of smoke and sulfur dioxide that will&#13;
be eliminated as a result of the project. The likelihood that they will suffer from occasional or&#13;
chronic respiratory diseases induced or exacerbated by exposure to particulates and sulfur dioxide&#13;
will be greatly reduced. Households and boilerhouse operators which convert their heating&#13;
systems will also benefit from improvements in the efficiency and quality of service of their&#13;
heating systems as well as from reductions in the time and effort required to operate them.&#13;
75.   The range of alternative approaches to reducing air pollution in urban centers in Slovenia&#13;
is limited. Some towns have encouraged or required coal distributors to switch to low sulfur coal&#13;
for use in households, small boilers and district heating plants -- for example, Trbovlje. This&#13;
has resulted in a substantial decline in average sulfur dioxide levels, but has had little or no&#13;
impact on particulate levels, which are the main source of health damage. It might be possible&#13;
to substitute smokeless solid fuels (based on anthracite) for local coal or wood, but this will&#13;
involve the development of new distribution or production arrangements since smokeless solid&#13;
fuels are not currently available in Slovenia. In any case, there is a clear preference for heating&#13;
systems using cleaner fuels among households and those responsible for small boilers, as they&#13;
eliminate the dirt and inconvenience associated with handling solid fuels, and are economically&#13;
and financially attractive.&#13;
76.   The economic analysis of the Project focuses on its impact in Maribor because the&#13;
necessary data required to carry out a full assessment of the costs and benefits were only&#13;
available for this city. However, it is reasonable to conclude that the results of this analysis are&#13;
representative of the net benefits of the Project over all of the towns and cities covered, as will&#13;
be explained below. The estimation of the environmental benefits focuses on the contribution&#13;
of lower pollution to the health of the population of Maribor. Reducing ambient exposure to&#13;
particulates and sulfur dioxide will lower the incidence of respiratory and other diseases and&#13;
reduce mortality associated with chronic conditions that are provoked or exacerbated by air&#13;
pollution. Taking account of these health benefits of reducing pollution implies that the Project&#13;
has a very high rate of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
77.   In addition to the impact of the project on health, the reduction in air polhltion will bring&#13;
other benefits (not quantified or included in the economic analysis) such as lower costs of&#13;
maintenance for buildings and equipment, improvements in the attractiveness of the town for both&#13;
visitors and local residents, and less damage to vulnerable ecosystems including forests. There&#13;
is ample evidence that people are willing to pay significant sums (relative to their income) in&#13;
order to enjoy the benefits of greater visibility and cleanliness associated with lower air pollution&#13;
quite independently of any expected health benefits. Hence, the rates of return reported for the&#13;
Project are very much a lower bound on the true rates of return taking account of all of the&#13;
environmental benefits.&#13;
78.   Using dose-response functions developed in North America and Western Europe and&#13;
summarized by Bart Ostro in Estimating the Health Benefits of Air Pollutants, health benefits&#13;
from reducing annual ambient concentrations by 10-20 micrograms per cubic meter should be&#13;
between 10-20 million DM per year (see Annex 2-.Iablk A2-1. 1). Epidemiological evidence&#13;
increasingly suggests that health impacts due to exposure to PM,o occur at ambient levels well&#13;
below current international standards and are approximately linear with exposure levels (see&#13;
Dockery, et. al., 1993). The evidence is less clear for sulfur dioxide. For the purposes of the&#13;
Program analysis, we have assumed that no threshold levels exist for either PM1O or sulfur&#13;
dioxide. If threshold levels exist for sulfur dioxide, then the health benefits from the Project will&#13;
be smaller.&#13;
79.   Even without the health benefits, there will be significant benefits from the conversion&#13;
to cleaner fuels. The fuel, operating and capital costs of alternative systems are substantially&#13;
higher for coal and wood than for natural gas, LPG, or district heat (see Annex  -1 Tabk 3A14).&#13;
As a result !ouseholds and boilerhouse operators have been steadily converting their systems&#13;
from coal ol wood to these fuels whenever major maintenance expenditures or replacement are&#13;
required (even before the introduction of the air quality regulations), provided that they have&#13;
access to the networks. Thus, the Project will have the effect of accelerating this conversion&#13;
process, bringing forward both the economic and the environmental benefits of conversion. The&#13;
combination of environmental benefits and savings on current running costs are more than&#13;
sufficient to justify an accelerated program of conversion although this means that many heating&#13;
systems will be converted before they are due for replacement.&#13;
80.   The following presents the impact of the Project on different groups in schematic form:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Groups                            Costs                   Benefits&#13;
Maribor Gas Company          Network expansion    Revenues from gas/heat sales&#13;
Maribor District Heating     Network 0 &amp; M&#13;
Wholesale gas&#13;
Air Pollution Abatement      Conversion costs      Borrower down payments&#13;
Administrative costs   Loan repayments&#13;
Households/Boilerhouse       Down payments         Savings on alternative&#13;
Loan payments          (capital, fuel, 0 &amp; M, time)&#13;
Fuel charges          Consumer surplus&#13;
Gas heating 0 &amp; M&#13;
Residents of Maribor                               Reduced mortality and&#13;
Cleanliness and amenity *&#13;
*     These benefits are positive and substantial, but no attempt has been made to estimate them&#13;
81.   Since different weights have not been attached to costs or benefits accruing to different&#13;
agents, it is possible to cancel out items which occur on both the cost and the benefit side. As&#13;
a result, the presentation of costs and benefits is as follows:&#13;
Costs                           Benefits&#13;
Network expansion               Savings on alternative heating&#13;
Network 0 &amp; M                   (fuel, 0 &amp; M, time costs)&#13;
Gas/heat purchases              Consumer surplus&#13;
Conversion costs                Reduced mortality and morbidity&#13;
Administrative costs            Cleanliness and amenity benefits&#13;
Heating system 0 &amp; M&#13;
In this schematic presentation, the consumer surplus is the conventional benefit triangle arising&#13;
because the full cost of providing a standard level of heating by gas or district heat is less than&#13;
the full cost of the same level of heating provided by an alternative fuel'.&#13;
82.   For the reasons give above, the detailed economic analysis of the program has been&#13;
carried out for Maribor. The economic rate of return excluding health benefits on the program&#13;
will be similar in other urban areas where the program will operate. The magnitude of the health&#13;
7  In fact, boilerhouses operating heavy fuel oil systems have lower costs than gas systems, so that in this case there&#13;
is a loss of consumer surplus rather than a benefit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
benefits is proportional to (a) the population of the town or city where the conversions occur, and&#13;
(b) the impact of the program on levels of air pollution in the town or city. Smaller towns --&#13;
such as Hrastnik, Trbolvje, and Zagorje -- tend to have worse air pollution that is strongly linked&#13;
to emissions from residential heating, so the smaller population is partly offset by the larger&#13;
impact of the program on average levels of exposure. Rough calculations suggest that the health&#13;
benefits are significant for these smaller towns but that the overall economic rates of return fall&#13;
in the range 15-25%. On the other hand, the overall economic rate of return for a lending&#13;
program in Ljubljana (with a population of 350,000) will be substantially higher than that for&#13;
Maribor. It is not possible to compute a sensible average rate of return for the project since this&#13;
will depend on the take-up rate for loans in different towns and cities. However, Ljubljana is&#13;
likely to account for a large share of loans, so that it is reasonable to conclude that the ultimate&#13;
economic rate of return on the Project will be at least as large as that for Maribor.&#13;
83.   The anticipated conversion path of the program in Maribor is shown in Annex 31 Tabl&#13;
A3-1.7. It is estimated that by the year 2000, about 2,600 more households and about 40 more&#13;
boilerhouses now using coal, wood, or heavy fuel oil will convert to cleaner fuels with the&#13;
Project than without the Project.&#13;
84.   The costs and benefits of the Project are shown in Annex 31 Tabk A3-1.8. Two&#13;
alternative scenarios have been made in estimating the environmental health benefits of the&#13;
Project. The starting points for each scenario are the estimated reductions in exposure to PM1O&#13;
and SO2 that will occur if all residential use of coal, wood and heavy fuel oil were eliminated8.&#13;
The project decline in levels of air pollution for each scenario was then obtained by estimating&#13;
emissions from the use of different fuels for residential heating given the projected level of&#13;
conversions and comparing this with the decline in emissions that will occur if the use of the&#13;
polluting fuels ceased immediately. Version 1 of the estimated health benefits, which represents&#13;
the best estimate on the available evidence, is based on a scenario in which the annual mean level&#13;
of PM1O and of sulfur dioxide will fall by 20 micrograms per cubic meter if all use of the&#13;
polluting fuels is discontinued. Version 2, which provides a lower bound for the plausible impact&#13;
of the Project, is based on a scenario in which the annual mean level of PM10 and of sulfur&#13;
dioxide will fall by only 10 micrograms per cubic meter on the same assumption. With either&#13;
of these assumptions, the Project has a large positive net present value at a discount rate of 12&#13;
% (assumed cost of capital in Slovenia). The internal rate of return (IRR) of the Project under&#13;
Version 1 is estimated to be 69 %, and under Version 2 the IRR is estimated to be 40 %.&#13;
85.   To be sure, there is considerable uncertainty as to how to value the expected reductions&#13;
in mortality and morbidity. For the purposes of this analysis, we have used estimates developed&#13;
8 These reductions were estimated by examining the average difference between average levels of pollution during&#13;
the heating and non-heating seasons over a number of years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
in the United States based on the costs of health care, wage rates, and the willingness to pay to&#13;
reduce the risk of death. Although we have adjusted these values to reflect differing income&#13;
levels between Slovenia and the United States, these are not likely to represent precisely Slovene&#13;
valuations. However, since we have selected values from the lower end of the U. S. range, the&#13;
health benefits in this analysis, after adjustment to Slovenian income levels, are intended to be&#13;
underestimates of the full environmental benefits of the Project. Annex 21 Tablk A2-1.1 shows&#13;
reductions in numbers of cases of illness and death expected in Maribor due to exposure to air&#13;
pollution, as well as the estimated economic value of these reductions.&#13;
86.   Even if the health benefits and the consumer surplus of the Project are excluded, the Air&#13;
Pollution Abatement component has an internal rate of return of 11 %. A price elasticity for&#13;
heating services of -0.25 has been used to compute the consumer surplus element of the benefits9.&#13;
Since there is considerable uncertainty about the appropriate value of this parameter, the final&#13;
column in AnTx1 labk A3-1.8 shows the net benefits excluding both the health benefits and&#13;
the consumer surplus.&#13;
87.   In summary, the Project component generates very large environmental benefits because&#13;
it reduces the damage to human health caused by air pollution. It has extremely high internal&#13;
rates of return when these benefits are taken into account. If all environmental benefits are&#13;
excluded, the Project generates acceptable internal rates of return. It is a clear example of a&#13;
"win-win" Project which produces both economic and environmental gains.&#13;
9      This value is at the low end (in absolute terms) of the range of estimates of the long run response of&#13;
household energy demand to changes in energy prices. Since heating costs dominate total energy&#13;
consumption in Slovenia, it is reasonable to base the analysis on such estimates. The range of elasticities for&#13;
household energy demand is typically -0.25 to -0.40.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
B.    Benefits of GIS Component&#13;
88.   The primary benefits of the Project include:&#13;
a.    Vastly improved information on which to base land-use decisions. Access to this&#13;
information will lead to more transparent, consistent, and speedy decision-making,&#13;
with resultant reductions in costs for individuals, firms, and governmental bodies.&#13;
The GIS database will be the primary database for environmental impact analysis&#13;
and for baseline information against which to judge changes in environmental&#13;
quality.&#13;
b.    The establishment of standards for data collection, data use and the maintenace of&#13;
databases as well as a quality assurance compliance group to ensure that the GIC&#13;
infornation system operates in accordance with international standards.&#13;
C.    Increased international and domestic confidence in land and geographical related&#13;
information which will likely have a significant impact on the short and long-term&#13;
economic development of Slovenia.&#13;
C.    Risks&#13;
1.    APA Component&#13;
89.   There are four types of risk that arise in the context of the Air Pollution Abatement&#13;
Component. These are:&#13;
a.    The take-up rate for conversion loans may be smaller than anticipated, in which&#13;
case the benefits from reduced air pollution relative to the outcome with no&#13;
project will be lower than expected while the APAP will have to cover its fixed&#13;
costs from a lower volume of lending.&#13;
b.    The average cost of conversion may be higher than estimated, in which case the&#13;
number of loans extended by the APAP from the fixed resources available to it&#13;
will be lower. In this case, again, the benefits from reduced air pollution will be&#13;
lower, while the costs incurred to generate these benefits will be higher. From&#13;
a financial point of view, there is no additional risk to the APAP under this&#13;
scenario since it will be able to disburse its loan funds more quickly with the&#13;
result that there will be a larger financial surplus when the APAP is wound up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
c.    The financial position of the APAP might be undermined by defaults on its loans,&#13;
since a zero default rate has been assumed in estimating an appropriate interest&#13;
margin between its lending and borrowing rates. This assumption is justified on&#13;
the basis that all of the Fund's loans will be insured or guaranteed against default,&#13;
so that the default risk is being absorbed by insurance companies or other&#13;
guarantors (such as municipalities in the case of boilerhouse conversions). Thus,&#13;
any significant number of actual defaults could arise from some systemic problem&#13;
in the financial position of insurance company or other guarantors. The EcoFund&#13;
has undertaken enquiries to establish that the insurance company offering the&#13;
guarantees is financially sound, but there is little more that can be done in the&#13;
framework of the project to eliminate systemic financial risk.&#13;
d.    The other potential threat to the financial position of the APAP arises from a&#13;
mismatch in interest rate movements so that its borrowing rate rises while its&#13;
lending rate does not adjust rapidly enough to preserve its net interest margin.&#13;
Since the Loan will be a single currency loan linked to LIBOR interest rates for&#13;
DM deposits, the APAP's borrowing rate will be subject to variations in line with&#13;
short term money market rates. However, this risk has been almost eliminated&#13;
by adopting the formula that the interest rate on APAP loans will be the World&#13;
Bank lending rate plus the agreed interest margin. The only remaining exposure&#13;
arises because, as discussed in Section IV.I above, the Bank does not notify&#13;
borrowers of the relevant interest rate on LIBOR-based single currency loans until&#13;
after the relevant period has begun. At worst, this might mean that sub-loan&#13;
repayments were not adjusted to an increase in the lending rate until one month&#13;
after the increased interest rate came into effect. Since LIBOR rates are, by their&#13;
nature, readily observable, the EcoFund will apply a provisional interest rate&#13;
based on the Bank's standard formula to avoid any difficulty arising from this&#13;
notification delay.&#13;
90.   The market survey carried out in Maribor during the preparation of the project suggests&#13;
that the projected rates of conversion from coal, wood or heavy fuel oil, to cleaner fuels are&#13;
conservative. However, as a further measure to reduce any risks arising from delays in&#13;
conversion, the Government has agreed to enforce stricter emissions regulations, which have&#13;
been introduced recently. In addition, the municipalities and the EcoFund have agreed to&#13;
institute public relations campaigns to publicize the individual and environmental benefits of fuel-&#13;
switching as well as the availability of loans from the APAP. This publicity has been tested in&#13;
Maribor under the pilot program funded by the EcoFund and will be fine-tuned in the light of&#13;
experience.&#13;
91.   Even if the conversions do proceed more slowly than expected, the impact on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
economic rate of return will be small. Since the non-environmental costs and benefits are closely&#13;
linked, the economic rate of return excluding environmental benefits will be only slightly lower.&#13;
For a 'delays' scenario in which the conversions in Maribor take 6 years rather than 4 years, the&#13;
economic rate of return will still be 11 %, the same as with the main case examined. The&#13;
financial projections under this scenario show that the APAP has a smaller but acceptable surplus&#13;
when it is wound up and that there should be no problem in maintaining adequate reserves.&#13;
92.   An alternative 'high cost' scenario assumes that average conversion costs are 20% higher&#13;
than assumed in the main analysis. Since the 'main case' figures were based upon extensive and&#13;
detailed work on likely conversion costs undertaken by consultants during the preparation of the&#13;
project, such cost overruns are highly unlikely. Under this scenario the economic rate of return&#13;
without environmental benefits will still be 11 %.&#13;
93.   Over the past 20 years LIBOR DM interest rates for 3 and 6 month deposits have varied&#13;
in a range from 3 % to 12 % with a median annual average rate of about 6 %. The current rate&#13;
of 3.7 % is, therefore, low by historical standards and must be expected to rise, so that the&#13;
Bank's lending rate for single currency DM loans will rise with it. The interest rate charged for&#13;
all APAP loans will be adjusted at semi-annual intervals in accordance with the agreed formula.&#13;
This means that the worst possible outcome will be a very sharp rise in LIBOR DM rates which&#13;
is quickly reflected in the World Bank's interest but there is a delay of one month before this&#13;
higher rate is reflected in the rate charged to existing borrowers. In such circumstances, the&#13;
average interest rate margin received by the APAP will be temporarily below the standard level&#13;
of 2% used to compute its lending rate. On the other hand, the APAP will benefit if interest&#13;
rates fell sharply afterwards as has often been the case. Gradual changes in interest rates, either&#13;
up or down, will have little impact on its position.&#13;
94.   To simulate the impact of such turbulence in international financial markets, the financial&#13;
position of the APAP has been examined for a worst case scenario. This follows the interest&#13;
movements that occurred in the early 1980s when LIBOR DM interest rates rose from 6.5% in&#13;
1979 to 8.6% in 1980 and to 11.8% in 1981 before falling back to 8.7% in 1982 and 5.7% in&#13;
1983. It is assumed that the interest rate increases occur in years 3 and 4 of the project when the&#13;
APAP is most vulnerable because it has been unable to build up reserves. The simulations show&#13;
that the APAP will be able to cope with such turbulence comfortably by temporarily drawing&#13;
upon its working capital of DM 0.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
2.    GIS Component&#13;
95.   The main risks affecting successful implementation of the GIS Component arise from the&#13;
lack of the qualified GIS staff; different sets of standards for collection and transfer of GIS data;&#13;
and lack of legislation and regulation to enforce the desired standards and administrative&#13;
procedures for GIS. These risks will be mitigated by requiring as a condition of effectiveness&#13;
of this component, that qualified staff have been hired, and that regulations to enforce desired&#13;
standards have been adopted.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
96.   The following actions are required to assure successful implementation of the Project and&#13;
attainment of the broader Project objectives.&#13;
97.   Air Pollution Abatement Component. Prir to negotiations, the EcoFund has fulfilled the&#13;
following conditions:&#13;
(i)    Arrangements to establish and make operational the Air Pollution Abatement&#13;
Program.&#13;
(ii)   Design, translation and submission of the existing Project Agreement between the&#13;
EcoFund and the financial agent for the APA Component. The Agreement takes&#13;
into consideration that the financial agent should take over part of the&#13;
responsibilities in the area of handling the loans and disbursements.&#13;
(iii)  Establishment of a Draft Operational Manual for the APA Component. The&#13;
manual includes eligibility criteria for loans; payroll deductions; loan agreements;&#13;
administrative procedures including forms and applications; certifications by the&#13;
Gas Company or the District Heating Company regarding availability of&#13;
connections; strategies for public relation campaigns, etc.&#13;
98.   Duxing negotiations, assurances were given that:&#13;
(i)   The EcoFund will make available, from its own resources, funds for 20 % of the&#13;
sub-project costs of the APAP program. These funds will carry an interest rate&#13;
and maturities similar to those on the World Bank sub-loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
(ii)   The EcoFund will make available from its own resources funds to cover potential&#13;
deficits of the APAP which might occur particularly during the early years of&#13;
APAP implementation but are not expected to exceed DM 0.5 million. This will&#13;
be about 2% of EcoFund's equity and can easily be accommodated.&#13;
(iii)  The EcoFund will have its accounts audited annually within 6 months after the&#13;
completion of each fiscal year by a qualified auditor acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
transmit the results of the audit to the Bank.&#13;
99.   Conditions of Effectiveness (APAP Component):&#13;
The EcoFund, in close cooperation with the financial agent, will strengthen the&#13;
Project Implementation Team (PIT), as necessary, with appropriately qualified&#13;
staff to manage all aspects of the APAP. After two additional staff, graduated&#13;
from one of the project related fields, will have been appointed for the PIT, this&#13;
condition will have been met.&#13;
100. Conditions of Effectiveness (GIS Component):&#13;
The MEPP will set up and strengthen a small PIT to implement the GIS&#13;
Component. After additional staff, graduated from one of the project related&#13;
fields, will have been appointed for the PIT, this condition will have been met.&#13;
101.  Subject to the above, the proposed operation provides a suitable basis for a loan of DM&#13;
30.0 million to the EcoFund with the guarantee of the Republic of Slovenia and for a loan of DM&#13;
4.6 million to the Republic of Slovenia (MEPP).&#13;

ANNEX 2-1&#13;
HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
Health and economic benefits. Table A2-1.1 gives estimates of how many fewer deaths&#13;
and cases of respiratory illness will occur per year in Maribor with a decline in ambient&#13;
concentrations of PM1o and sulfur dioxide, and the economic value of these declines. We have&#13;
calculated the health benefits using dose-response functions developed in the United States and&#13;
Western Europe. These dose-response functions have been computed for incremental changes in&#13;
annual ambient concentrations in PMIo and sulfur dioxide, and are linear. The property of&#13;
linearity allows us to estimate annual health damage due to changes in annual ambient pollution&#13;
levels, although most health damage in Maribor (and any city where coal is a primary fuel for&#13;
space heating) occurs during the winter months. The population affected is 105,400 people,&#13;
including about 24,000 people below age 14.&#13;
To provide a sense of the economic impacts associated with the health damages, we have&#13;
assigned a monetary value to each category of health damage. Ideally, these would reflect the&#13;
total cost to the affected individual, which includes both direct costs, such as the costs of seeing&#13;
a doctor, buying medication, and lost wages, (referred to as the cost of illness), and indirect costs,&#13;
such as pain, discomfort, and restrictions in non-work activities. The value of the indirect costs&#13;
is the maximum amount the affected individual (or potentially affected individual) would be&#13;
willing to pay to prevent or eliminate the health effect, (known as willingness to pay or just&#13;
WTP).&#13;
Here, we have used values derived from studies carried out in the United States and&#13;
Western Europe. In the United States, studies have shown that individuals are willing to pay&#13;
about US$3 to reduce the risk of death by one in one million. Aggregated over a large&#13;
population, this amounts to about US$3 million per death avoided. Here we have arbitrarily used&#13;
a much more conservative figure of US$1 million as the value of a statistical life. The cost of a&#13;
respiratory hospital admission is simply the cost of the illness, comprised of US$26,900 for an&#13;
average of 10 days in the hospital and US$1,270 for lost wages. The values of all other illnesses&#13;
linked to exposure to PM1O and sulfur dioxide are based on this cost of illness approach.&#13;
The United States values have been adjusted to reflect differences in per capita income&#13;
between Slovenia and the United States. The most recent data show per capita income in Slovenia&#13;
to be US$6,310 and of United States per capita income to be US$23,240. Therefore, in this&#13;
analysis, Slovenia values are 27.15 percent of United States values.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Key Assumptions, Fuel Use, Emissions, and Ambient Air Quality,&#13;
Conversion Rates, and Costs and Benefits of the Project&#13;
This Annex contains the following tables:&#13;

1991-93&#13;
Table A3-1.2 Heating conversion potential in Maribor&#13;

Table A3-1.4 Key assumptions used in calculating the costs and benefits of converting to natural&#13;
gas or district heating&#13;
Table A3-1.5 PM1O and SO2 emissions in tonnes per Mtoe of fuel&#13;
Table A3-1.6 Fuel use, emissions, and ambient air quality for Maribor&#13;
Table A3-1.7 Anticipated conversions to clean fuels in Maribor with and without the project&#13;
Table A3-1.8 Costs and benefits of the project&#13;
Details on the tables follow.&#13;
Key assumptions. The economic analysis of the project is based on a comparison of costs&#13;
and benefits, with and without the project. Table A3-1.4 shows the key assumptions used to&#13;
calculate the economic benefits of the project, including fuel use and costs, operating and&#13;
maintenance costs and capital costs. Anticipated conversions of existing facilities with and&#13;
without the project for four alternative heating systems are shown in table A3-1.7. Table A3-1.4&#13;
shows the annualized capital cost of alternative heating systems, assuming an interest rate of 6.5&#13;
percent, (column I) to highlight the difference in annualized capital costs between a natural gas&#13;
or a district heating system and the alternatives'. The annual savings (costs) are shown in column&#13;
T. The table also shows the consumer surplus produced with the gas or the district heating system&#13;
-- the amount consumers would be willing to pay in excess of what they actually have to pay for&#13;
their heat. Finally, the table shows the expenses the gas and district heating companies will incur&#13;
to meet the increased demand.&#13;
Fuel use, emissions, and ambient air quality. Table A3-1.6 shows fuel use, emissions,&#13;
and ambient air quality for Maribor. For the analysis, we assume that heating season ambient air&#13;
concentrations of PM,0 and sulfur dioxide fall close to non-heating season averages once dirty fuel&#13;
fuel users convert to cleaner fuels. In Maribor, concentrations of PM1o and sulfur dioxide average&#13;
l     The cost benefit analysis (Table A3-1.8) treats all capital costs as sunk costs, so the savings on capital&#13;
costs are not included as part of the benefits of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-1                                                                       2&#13;
about 65 micrograms per cubic meter during the heating season, and about 20 during the non-&#13;
heating season; the annual average is about 40 micrograms per cubic meter. Since there are no&#13;
other major sources of emissions which could account for the difference between winter and&#13;
summertime concentrations, we can assume that almost all the difference is due to the use of dirty&#13;
fuels. Eliminating the use of these fuels for space heating should lower wintertime PM,o and&#13;
sulfur dioxide concentrations to the levels prevailing during the other months of the year, and&#13;
therefore should reduce annual averages by at least 20 micrograms per cubic meter (Version 1).&#13;
We have also shown results for a smaller decline in ambient concentrations of 10 micrograms per&#13;
cubic meter (Version 2).&#13;
Improvements in ambient air quality are proportional to reductions in emissions from the&#13;
burning of coal, gas-oil, and heavy fuel oil. The improvements shown in Table A3-1.6 are&#13;
relative to what would occur without the project. For example, in 1998, the annual ambient air&#13;
concentration of PM1O is 11 micrograms per cubic meter lower than without the project, assuming&#13;
the decline in PM,O concentrations once the project is fully implemented is 20 micrograms per&#13;
cubic meter (Version 1).&#13;
Conversion rates. Table A3-1.7 shows anticipated conversions in Maribor by fuel type&#13;
for the Air Pollution Abatement Component with and without the project. For example, with the&#13;
project, 1,500 more households and 24 more boiler houses now using coal, wood, or heavy fuel&#13;
oil would convert to clean fuels by the year 1997 with the project than without the project.&#13;
Costs and benefits. Table A3-1.8 shows the costs and benefits of the project. These are&#13;
based on the difference of what would occur with and without the project. With the project,&#13;
annual gas network expansion costs would be 700,000 DM higher in 1995 than without the&#13;
project. This is computed as follows: with the project, network expansion costs are 3 million&#13;
DM, or 1 million per year from 1995-97. Without the project, the network will still expand, but&#13;
more slowly: without the project network expansion costs are 300,000 DM per year. With the&#13;
project, network expansion costs are 700,000 DM higher than without the project for 3 years from&#13;
1995-97. From 1998-2004 they are 300,000 less, since these costs would have been incurred&#13;
anyway. The present value of this stream of costs at an interest rate of 12 percent is 707,000 DM.&#13;
The calculations for all the cost categories are carried out the same way.&#13;
Benefits include (i) avoided fuel, and operating and maintenance costs of the old systems,&#13;
(ii) consumer surplus, and (iii) health benefits. (The savings on running costs per household or&#13;
boiler house are shown in Table A3-1.4, column H). The benefits represent the difference of&#13;
what would occur with the project versus without the project.&#13;
To truncate the analysis at 20 years, it is necessary to assume that the number of&#13;
unconverted systems after the final period is identical for both the with project and without project&#13;
cases. Because we assume that the difference is eliminated in the final year, there is a large&#13;
negative conversion cost in that year. Since the conversion of heating systems on its own has a&#13;
positive net present value, this end-of-period adjustment must be less than the present value of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-1                                                                             3&#13;
benefits that would arise from a continuing difference between the number of converted systems&#13;
under the two cases. Thus, the analysis understates the true net benefits of the project.&#13;
Health benefits are presented for two assumptions.  Under Version 1, ambient&#13;
concentrations of both PMIo and sulfur dioxide fall by 20 micrograms per cubic meter. Under&#13;
Version 2, ambient concentrations fall by only 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Table A3. 1 shows&#13;
in detail the assumptions used to calculate the health benefits.&#13;

ANNEX 3-2&#13;
REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA&#13;
ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was tentatively agreed upon with the EcoFund and&#13;
the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MEPP) during appraisal and finalized during&#13;
negotiations. The PIP is the result of the joint efforts of the staff of the EcoFund, the MEPP and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
1.    The Project&#13;
A.   Project Objectives&#13;
2.    The objectives of the Environment Project are to:&#13;
(i)   significantly reduce the urban air pollution in Slovenian towns with the highest&#13;
pollution levels with a view to reducing and eliminating damage to health being&#13;
sustained by the urban population; and&#13;
(ii)  assist the MEPP in developing standardized data sets and procedures to strengtheland&#13;
use planning and environmental management capabilities.&#13;
B.   Project Description&#13;
3.    The proposed project has two components:&#13;
(i)   Air Pollution Abatement (APA) Component. Under this component, the project&#13;
will provide sub-loans to households and boilerhouse owners/operators in the most&#13;
polluted areas of Slovenia, to procure the equipment, materials, labor and small&#13;
works needed to convert heating systems which use polluting fuels (coal, wood, other&#13;
solid fuels, and heavy fuel oil) to the use of clean fuels (natural gas, LPG, district&#13;
heating, heat pumps, and solar heating).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                     5&#13;
(ii)   Geographical Information System (GIS) Component. This component will&#13;
include the development and implementation of the expansion of the Slovenian&#13;
Geographical Information Center. The project will provide computer hardware and&#13;
software and technical assistance, including consultant services, and training.&#13;
4.    The total project cost is about DM 55.4 million, of which DM 34.6 million will be financed&#13;
through loans from the World Bank to the EcoFund for the Air Pollution Abatement Component&#13;
(DM 30 million, Guarantee from the Republic of Slovenia) and the Government for the GIC&#13;
component to be implemented by the MEPP (DM 4.6 million). The project will be implemented&#13;
over a period of five years by the EcoFund and the MEPP.&#13;
II.   Implementation Arrangements&#13;
A.   Organization Responsible for the APA - Component&#13;
5.    The borrower for the project will be (i) the Slovenian EcoFund (Ekolosko Razvojni Sklad&#13;
Republike Slovenije) for the Air Pollution Abatement Component (APA Component) and (ii) the&#13;
MEPP for the GIC component.&#13;
6.    Air Pollution Abatement Component. The EcoFund has set up a Project Implementation&#13;
Team (PIT) (see the Chart "Organization of Project Implementation" in Figure I of Annex 3-2) for&#13;
preparation and implementation of the APA Component. The team consists of the Director of the&#13;
EcoFund, three Assistant Directors, and a general secretary. The PIT will be assisted by additional&#13;
consultants when needed. The Director of the EcoFund will be the project director and head of the&#13;
PIT. He will be responsible for project implementation, including coordination with other agencies&#13;
involved in implementing the project, for management of the loan funds, and for cooperation with&#13;
the World Bank. Two additional staff will be hired before August 1996. The PIT will have the&#13;
following responsibilities:&#13;
Implementation:&#13;
-     Organize information campaigns for informing households and boilerhouse&#13;
owners/operators about availability of loan funds;&#13;
-     Supervise processing of appliations for sub-loans and sub-project implementation;&#13;
-     Monitor project expenditures and costs, and loan repayments;&#13;
-     Ensure the timely preparation and submission to relevant government institutions and&#13;

Select a financial agent (FA) for the administration of EcoFund loans (this has been&#13;
done already for a Pilot Program in Maribor);&#13;
Prepare and execute a Financial Administration Agreement between EcoFund and&#13;
the Financial Agent. This also has been done already for a Pilot Program in Maribor.&#13;
Modifications to expand the agreement to the full APA component have been agreed&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
Prepare, in close collaboration with the FA, a proforma sub-loan agreement between&#13;
EcoFund and the beneficiaries, covering conditions of the loans (guarantees, loan&#13;
repayment, procurement, disbursements, auditing, reporting, etc.), and to monitor and&#13;
evaluate the implementation of these loan arrangements (this has been done already&#13;
for a Pilot Program in Maribor);&#13;
Participate in the financing of APAP loan beneficiaries (providing loans);&#13;
Coordinate project implementation with the FA and monitor and evaluate the loan&#13;
administration;&#13;

B.   Financial Agent (FA) for the APA Component&#13;
7.    While the EcoFund PIT would have the overall responsibility for the implementation of this&#13;
component, the services of a commercial bank would be engaged as a Financial Agent. In close&#13;
cooperation with the Bank, Nova Kreditna Banca Maribor (NKBM) was selected as a FA and&#13;
discharged its responsibilities satisfactorily during the pilot phase of the program that operated from&#13;
September to November 1995 in Maribor. It has been agreed during negotiations that NKBM will&#13;
continue to act as the FA for the project. The responsibilities of the FA, who should continue to be&#13;
in good standing with the Bank of Slovenia, would be as follows:&#13;
Prepare an information sheet, including the eligibility criteria for the sub-loans and&#13;
a sub-loan application form and its distribution to potential beneficiaries, households&#13;
and boilerhouse owners/operators;&#13;
Receive sub-loan applications, reviewing them against the pre-agreed eligibility&#13;
criteria and approving the sub-loan applications or rejecting them for not meeting the&#13;
eligibility criteria, such as the applicant's ability to provide 20% of the sub-project&#13;
cost and his or her ability to repay the loan amount;&#13;
-     Sign sub-loan agreements; monitor their execution;&#13;
-     Receive purchase orders, invoices and vouchers from the beneficiaries, review them&#13;
for accuracy and, with the help of the PIT, for compliance with the procurement&#13;
procedures, and make payments to suppliers;&#13;
-     For sub-loans to households, submit to the PIT Statements of Expenditures based on&#13;
the purchase orders, invoices and vouchers and submit them to the EcoFund for&#13;
reimbursement;&#13;
-     For sub-loans to boilerhouse owners/operators, submit to the PIT the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures based on the contracts or the purchase orders, invoices and vouchers,&#13;
and submit them to the EcoFund for reimbursement.&#13;
-     Maintain sub-loan accounts, and payment documents, and make them available, upon&#13;
request, to the PIT, the World Bank staff and auditors.&#13;
-     Prepare and submit a quarterly report to the PIT on the number of applications&#13;
received; number of sub-loans granted; number of sub-loans rejected, reasons for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                     8&#13;

(a)   For households, the term of the loan will be up to 6 years;&#13;
(b)   For boilerhouse owners/operators, the term will be up to 10 years.&#13;
9.    The sub-loan amounts would cover 80 % of the conversion costs. The Bank loan would&#13;
finance 75 % of the volume of lending (up to DM30 million) and the EcoFund EcoFund would&#13;
finance 25 %. The PIT has prepared an Operational Manual which includes detailed eligibility&#13;
criteria for loans, administrative procedures including forms for applications, and the procedure&#13;
for certification by the natural gas company or the district heating company regarding availability&#13;
of connections, payroll deductions, loan agreements, etc.&#13;

Annex 3-2                                                                       12&#13;
III.   Project Costs and Financing&#13;
A.    Project Costs&#13;
17.   The estimated cost by project component is shown in Table 1.3. Detailed yearly project costs&#13;
are also shown in Table 1.4. Cost tables for both components are shown in Tables Al and A2.&#13;
18.   Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)   Base Costs. Cost estimates for the APAP are based on the results of the pilot phase&#13;
of the program and on market surveys carried out to estimate the potential of&#13;
converting households and district heating plants from coal to gas in Maribor. These&#13;
studies were financed by the Bank's Dutch Trust Fund for Central and Eastern&#13;
Europe. The cost estimates for the GIC component are based on previous purchases&#13;
by the MEPP of GIS computer hardware and software.&#13;
(b)   Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies of 3 % or DM 0.2 million have&#13;
been included in the GIC component. Price contingencies for the GIC component&#13;
are estimated at DM 0.2 million equivalent to 10% of the local base cost and 2%&#13;
of the foreign exchange cost. No contingencies are included in the costs of the APA&#13;
component since this will operate as a line of credit, though an allowance for&#13;
inflation has been included in estimating the average loan sizes and thus the number&#13;
of loans that can be financed from the funds made available under the Project.&#13;
(c)   Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
about DM 34.6 million (DM 30 million for the APA Component and DM4.6 million&#13;
for the GIC component).&#13;
B.    Detailed Financing Plan&#13;
19.   The proposed Bank loans of total DM 34.6 million would finance approximately 62 % of the&#13;
total project costs. The EcoFund, final borrowers, and the MEPP would finance the balance of the&#13;
project costs (about DM 20.8 million), including duties and taxes. The Financing Plan is shown in&#13;
Tables 1.1 and 1.2 below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Notes: Numbers may not add up due to rounding&#13;
a/     Figures in parentheses are the amounts financed by the Bank Loans.&#13;
b/     Other includes: procurement by households by local shopping (DM20.0 million); procurement by private&#13;
boilerhouse owners/operators using established commercial practices (at least three price quotations) and by&#13;
public boilerhouse owners/operators using public procurement regulations (DM10 million)&#13;
C/    Includes Intemational Shopping (DM300,000), and Direct Contracting (DM300,000).&#13;
d/     Procurement according to Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (DM4.0 million)&#13;
21.   APA Component. During project implementation, EcoFund would make approximately&#13;
6,500 sub-loans to households and 65 sub-loans to boilerhouse owners/operators. Of the total&#13;
estimated cost of DM 50 million for the component, the Bank loan will cover DM 30 million or&#13;
about 60%. 20% of the sub-loans will be funded by the EcoFund, 20% by the beneficiaries. A&#13;
yearly sub-loan schedule is in Table A3.&#13;
22.   Households and boilerhouse owners/operators will procure the needed equipment, materials,&#13;
labor and associated civil works, in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines dated January 1995,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
(a)    Households. Individual contracts for heating equipment and materials for households&#13;
should generally not exceed DM 12,500. The Bank has established that the labor,&#13;
material and equipment that would be required by households to convert their heating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                      17&#13;
systems to cleaner fuels are available within Slovenia from several sources to ensure&#13;
sufficient competition. The Bank has also established that normally households buy&#13;
prudently by comparing prices obtained from several sources and taking into account&#13;
the quality and performance of the equipment. Consequently, the households would&#13;
be allowed to procure the necessary labor, equipment and materials using these&#13;
practices of several sources.&#13;
(b)   Boilerhouse owners/operators. A brief assessment of the public and private&#13;
procurement practices and market in Slovenia of heating equipment for larger&#13;
boilerhouses has confirmed that there is significant competition in Slovenia for the&#13;
supply of the heating equipment of all sizes. Both foreign made and locally&#13;
manufactured heating equipment is easily available through various competitive&#13;
sources in Slovenia. The private operators of boilerhouses follow established&#13;
commercial practices for their purchases, which include obtaining several quotations&#13;
from suppliers and purchasing the equipment on the basis of its price and&#13;
performance. Consequently, the private operators of boilerhouses would be allowed&#13;
to use the established commercial practices, subject to their obtaining at least three&#13;
quotations.  The public operators of boilerhouses are subject to the Public&#13;
Procurement Decree of May 29, 1993. This Decree provides for tendering for&#13;
contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of DM 6,000 or more for a minimum of&#13;
three quotations per tender. This practice has been found acceptable for use by the&#13;
public operators of boilerhouses for their purchases under the project. No sub-loan&#13;
under this component is expected to exceed DM 250,000.&#13;
23.   The FA would manage the flow of funds from EcoFund to beneficiaries (households and&#13;
boilerhouse owners/operators). The FA and the EcoFund would ensure that prices obtained by the&#13;
beneficiaries following the above-mentioned procurement methods reflect current market prices.&#13;
24.   GIC component. The Component includes GIS computer hardware and software packages&#13;
(DM730,000); local consultants (DM1,260,000 aggregate); and five large consultant assignments&#13;
to be procured internationally (DM3.96 million). These packages would be procured in accordance&#13;
with the following procurement methods:&#13;
(a)   Procurement of Goods&#13;
(i).  International Shopping based on comparison of price quotations obtained&#13;
from at least three suppliers in two different countries for contracts estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of more than DM30,000 but less than DM250,000 each&#13;
(aggregate DM 300,000).&#13;
(ii). Direct Contracting would be used for four packages (estimated to cost&#13;
DM300,000). The justification for direct contracting is upgrading of existing&#13;
GIS software and compatibility with the existing equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                       18&#13;
(b)   Procurement of Consultant Services&#13;
The Component includes six assignments at a total cost of up to DM 4.72 million. One of&#13;
the assignments includes the engagement of the services of local GIS experts (up to&#13;
DM1,260,000 aggregate). For the remaining assignments, experienced consulting firms&#13;
would be shortlisted and invited to submit proposals.&#13;
25.   A list of packages, along with their cost and proposed procurement methods, and an&#13;
implementation plan and schedule are shown in Table A4.&#13;
26.   Review of Procurement Documents by the Bank.  The Bank would review the&#13;
procurement documents as follows:&#13;
APA-Component&#13;
for the first two loans to be made to households: quotations or pro forma invoices;&#13;
for the first two contracts to be concluded with owners/operators of boilerhouses.&#13;
GIS-Component&#13;
for the first international shopping contract;&#13;
for all direct contracts;&#13;
for all consultancy assignments and training (see para. 24).&#13;
27.   Procurement of Consultant Services and Training. In the case of consulting services and&#13;
training, all TORs and selection procedures would apply to all consulting contracts above DM75,000&#13;
and for amendments to consulting contracts that raise the contract value to DM75,000 or above for&#13;
individual consultants. All assignments of a critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank,&#13;
would also be subject to the Bank's prior review. The Bank's standard bidding documents would&#13;
be used for the recruitment of consultants, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have&#13;
agreed to as necessary for purposes of the project.&#13;
28.   Since the project does not have an ICB package, no General Procurement Notice would be&#13;
published. Slovenia has in force a Procurement Decree and a public procurement law is under&#13;
preparation. A country procurement assessment has not been carried out for Slovenia.&#13;
29.   Implementation. The EcoFund PIT and the PIT within the MEPP would be responsible&#13;
for ensuring that procurement under the respective components is being carried out in accordance&#13;
with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines. The EcoFund PIT includes staff who have experience&#13;
in procurement in Bank-financed projects. In addition, two members of the EcoFund PIT attended&#13;
a World Bank-organized implementation seminar which included several presentations on&#13;
procurement. The seminar was held in Budapest in January 1995. The Ministry of Finance will&#13;
assist the PIT in the MEPP in procurement and disbursement. These arrangements are regarded fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                       19&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
D.   Disbursement Arrangements and Schedules&#13;
30.   Disbursements. The proposed project is expected to be disbursed over a period of five&#13;
years. The closing date would be June 30, 2001. A summary of the disbursement plan is shown in&#13;
Table 1.6 below.&#13;
Table 1.6 Disbursements by year (DM Million)&#13;
IBRD FY                   1997        1998       1999       2000        2001&#13;
Annual                     9.5        11.5         8.1        3.4        2.1&#13;
Cumulative                 9.5        21.0        29.1       32.5       34.6&#13;
31.   Under the APA Component, the sub-loans would finance up to 80% of the costs of&#13;
subprojects. In terms of sub-loans of the EcoFund, World Bank funds would cover over 75% and&#13;
EcoFund financing 25%.&#13;
32.   Flow of Funds under the Project. The EcoFund PIT, which includes a financial expert&#13;
(who has been trained in disbursement procedures), would be responsible for making payments to&#13;
suppliers of goods and services under the APA Component, for withdrawing funds from the loan,&#13;
for managing and replenishing the Special Account, and for keeping up-to-date and accurate project&#13;
accounts. The use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) would be allowed for contracts of less than&#13;
DM 400,000 each. For these contracts, there would be no need of sending supporting documents&#13;
(i.e., the Contract/Purchase Order, Invoices, Shipment Document, Payment Certificates or Receipts)&#13;
to the World Bank. Only a Statement of Expenditures, based on the supporting documents, would&#13;
be sent to the World Bank, along with a Withdrawal Application. The supporting documents would&#13;
be kept in Slovenia, and would be made available to the Bank staff and auditors upon request for&#13;
verification and audit. To facilitate timely project implementation, EcoFund would establish,&#13;
maintain and operate under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account. The&#13;
authorized allocation of the Special Account would be initially DM 4 million. However, when the&#13;
aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of DM 6 million, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of DM5 million by submitting the&#13;
relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every&#13;
three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting&#13;
documents.&#13;
33.   Under the APA Component, the beneficiaries will submit purchase order, invoices, vouchers&#13;
and receipts to FA. The FA would verify these documents and prepare Statements of Expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2                                                                     20&#13;
and submit them to the PIT for verification and payment. The FA would have the option of paying&#13;
the suppliers from its resources and then ask the PIT for reimbursement through the SOEs or ask the&#13;
PIT to pay the suppliers directly on the basis of the information that would be provided in the SOEs.&#13;
The FA would ensure that it maintains in its files all the supporting documents, along with a copy&#13;
of the SOE. The PIT would check the SOE, make payment to the FA or to suppliers directly at FA's&#13;
request from the Special Account and would use the SOE for preparing and submitting withdrawal&#13;
applications to the World Bank for disbursements of funds against the SOEs.&#13;
34.   For the GIS-Component, the MEPP will submit the signed contracts for goods and&#13;
consultants to the Ministry of Finance. This unit would make payments to suppliers and use the&#13;
contracts, purchaser orders, invoices, bills, shipping documents, payments receipts, etc., for&#13;
preparing SOEs for obtaining funds from the Loan Account.&#13;
E.    Audits and Reporting&#13;
35.   Project Audits. Project Accounts for both Components, the Special Account, the EcoFund&#13;
accounts in general, and the APAP records of the financial agent will be audited by an independent&#13;
auditor, acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank" (March 1992). EcoFund will&#13;
provide to the Bank (within six months of the end of each financial year), an audit report of the&#13;
Project accounts for the APA component and the Ministry of Finance for the GIC component of such&#13;
scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion on disbursements&#13;
against certified statements of expenditures (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether&#13;
the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications. In&#13;
addition, the EcoFund will prepare financial forecasts.&#13;
36.   Furthermore, in its contract with the selected FA, the EcoFund will ensure that the auditors&#13;
would cover in their audit the APAP-related records and that they would report on their findings as&#13;
part of their Annual Audit Report.&#13;
37.   Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PITs will prepare semi-annual descriptive and&#13;
financial reports on each respective project component, objective and activity (beginning from the&#13;
date of Loan Effectiveness). The reports will describe: (a) current status; (b) deviations, if any, from&#13;
the implementation plan; and (c) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken.&#13;
These reports will be based on the quarterly status reports to be submitted by the FA for the APA&#13;
Component and by the Ministry of Finance for the GIC component. Bank supervision will be based&#13;
on the semi-annual progress reports.&#13;
38.   The EcoFund will regularly review the selected FA's APAP-related performance and will&#13;
report to the Bank on the same by September 30 (covering the period January to June) and March&#13;
31 (covering the period July to December) each year.&#13;

            Slovenia - Environment Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Environment
            Project are to: 1) reduce ambient concentrations of
            particulate matter (for particles of less than 10 microns in
            diameter) and sulfur dioxide along with the health damage
            associated with exposure to air pollution; and 2) collect,
            organize and manage information for development and land-use
            planning, particularly in areas of Slovenia that are
            experiencing rapid development. The project consists of two
            major components: 1) an air pollution abatement component
            which will provide fuel conversion loans to about 6,500
            households and about 65 boilerhouse operators during the
            three years over which the Bank loan will be disbursed.
            These loans will be used to finance the conversion of
            heating and hot water systems currently using polluting
            fuels to the use of cleaner fuels; and 2) a geographical
            information system (GIS) component which will include the
            following: (a) the establishment of a central Geographical
            Information Center; (b) the establishment of a market
            development group to promote the use of GIS, to provide
            training (in the use of GIS), to raise market awareness on
            exchange of data and to provide assistance to regional
            administrations, government agencies and departments, and
            domestic and foreign industrial, commercial and service
            users; (c) the establishment of formal standards (in line
            with international standards) on data collection, use and
            maintenance of data and quality assurance compliance group
            to ensure that the information system operates in accordance
            with international standards; and (d) the establishment of a
            local training center in order to develop local expertise in
            the operation of GIS.
