  Box 1.â&#128;&#130; Regional: Index of Web-based Access to Judicial Information&#13;
&#13;
  Since 2004, the Centro de Estudios de Justicia de las AmÃ©ricas (CEJA) has been developing an annual&#13;
  report on the accessibility of judicial information on the Internet. The objective of this initiative is to analyze&#13;
  the progress, backsliding and current challenges to the justice systems in the countries of the Americas&#13;
  regarding the provision of different types of information via electronic means to citizens and the degree&#13;
  of transparency of the courts and public prosecutorsâ&#128;&#153; offices. The index is developed by examining 25&#13;
  indicators to evaluate judicial branches and 19 indicators in the case of public prosecutors. This CEJA&#13;
  project has made it possible to monitor the degree of progress in web-based access to information pro-&#13;
  vided by the judicial branches and public prosecution offices of the 34 member states of the Organization&#13;
  of American States (OAS), as well as to compare their evolutionâ&#128;&#148;and in some cases, devolutionâ&#128;&#148;over&#13;
  the past years. The indicators examined include aspects such as:&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Existence of a website.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Publishing and updating of rulings and regulations.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Publishing of statistics on cases filed, resolved and pending.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Publishing of the Courtsâ&#128;&#153; agenda.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Budget, salaries, background, assets and income, and disciplinary matters on relevant officials.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Publishing of bidding and procurement information for contracts.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Access and information regime.&#13;
&#13;
  The 2007 report lists Costa Rica, Brazil, Chile, Canada and Argentina at the top of the ranking, as the&#13;
  countries with the largest quantity of information in the Web. At the other end are Belize, Guatemala,&#13;
  Surinam, Guyana and Haiti, countries that in some cases have no information at all in the Internet. For&#13;

        Challenges in the&#13;
        Relationship between&#13;
        the Judiciary and Society&#13;
&#13;
    In Latin America there is an important divide                consolidating the existing gap between the judi-&#13;
    between society and Justice, which, among oth-               cial institutions and society, is caused by two key&#13;
    er reasons, is explained by the culture of secrecy           factors. On the one hand, there is a severe defi-&#13;
    and opacity which has characterized the judi-                cit in the media in terms of their capacity to re-&#13;

    regarding the operation of the administration                In many cases, journalists and editors lack ade-&#13;
    of justice, and a marked interference from oth-              quate training to cover the activity of the courts&#13;
    er political powers in the work of judges. As a              andâ&#128;&#148;an even more complex issueâ&#128;&#148;to explain&#13;
    result, citizens in the regionâ&#128;&#153;s countries have an           to society the legal issues that they address in&#13;

       Box 2.â&#128;&#130; Chile: Public Procurement Law&#13;
&#13;
       Chileâ&#128;&#153;s Public Procurement Law (Law 19.886) became effective in 2004. The law includes the three gov-&#13;
       ernment branches and may be applied to the execution of support actions, implementation of works,&#13;
       public works concessions, the contracting of studies, and advisory and consulting services, among others.&#13;
&#13;
       Furthermore, the law set up the Public Procurement Directorate, to manage the electronic procurement&#13;
       system â&#128;&#156;ChileCompraâ&#128;&#157; (www.chilecompra.cl). All state agencies (including the Judiciary) have the obli-&#13;
       gation to publish announcements of intended purchases and service contracts in this portal. Likewise,&#13;
       starting in April 2007, all bidding processes related to the Judiciary are published and updated on its&#13;
       website, www.poderjudicial.cl.&#13;
&#13;
       Finally, the law regulates conflicts of interest in government procurement, requiring that officials partici-&#13;

       Box 5.â&#128;&#130; Argentina: Transparency and participation in judge appointment arrangements&#13;
&#13;
       In 2002, in the midst of a deep institutional crisis in Argentina, the Supreme Court of Justice was severely&#13;
       questionedâ&#128;&#148;both by political actors and citizensâ&#128;&#148;because of its irregular performance over the previous&#13;
       decade during President Carlos Menemâ&#128;&#153;s administration. At that time, the Court had been expanded,&#13;
       with the number of Justices increasing from five to nine (it is worthwhile noting that Article 99 in the&#13;
       Argentine Constitution grants the President of the Republic powers to appoint the members of the&#13;
       Supreme Court of Justice).&#13;
&#13;
       Shortly after taking office in 2003, President NÃ©stor Kirchner asked Congress to impeach the President&#13;
       of the Supreme Court and several of its members. At the same time, through Decree 222/03, he imple-&#13;
       mented a series of measures that restricted his powers to appoint new Supreme Court justices. The&#13;
       reforms implemented by President Kirchner may be divided into three groups. First, he limited his dis-&#13;
       cretionality in the selection of candidates to fill vacancies in the Court; provided for diversity, in gender,&#13;
       specialization and regional affiliation; and made it mandatory for candidates to fulfill objective guidelines&#13;
       regarding qualifications. Secondly, he defined a series of requirements linked to nominations, such&#13;
       as: a) the establishment of time limits to cover the vacancies in the Court; b) the obligation of publicly&#13;
       disclosing the background of the candidates; and c) a greater ethical scrutiny of the candidates (requir-&#13;
       ing a statement of financial disclosure, professional, commercial, and taxpaying background). Finally,&#13;
       an opportunity for participation was introduced, allowing citizens to provide their input and opinions&#13;
       regarding the proposed candidates.&#13;
&#13;
       Subsequently, Decree 588/03 extended the application of the above rules to the appointments of the&#13;
       National Attorney General and National Public Defender (Ombusdman), and for the appointment of&#13;
       judges to head the lower federal courts.&#13;
&#13;
       In line with the reforms implemented by the Executive, the Senate reformed its rules to improve the&#13;
       process whereby it approves judicial appointments. Mainly, they established that: a) hearings should be&#13;
       held during these processes with public participation; b) civil society involvement in the process should&#13;
       be promoted; c) once the hearings are completed, the Appointments Committee is required to issue an&#13;
       opinion; and d) senatorsâ&#128;&#153; individual decisions are disclosed through nominal voting.&#13;
&#13;
       The enforcement of these changes in the appointment of new judges caused a major impact, which was&#13;
       most evident in the case of the National Supreme Court. It resulted in an improved image of the Court&#13;
       vis-Ã -vis society, granting it greater legitimacy derived from the broad consensus on the appointed can-&#13;
       didates. Additionally, the changes contributed to consolidating the Courtâ&#128;&#153;s institutional strength, giving&#13;
       its members more authority and independence. This was reflected in decisions that were often divergent&#13;
       from the interests of the Executive, breaking with the general trend of agreement with the Executive that&#13;
       had characterized the body when it was formed by judges appointed through the previous procedure.&#13;
&#13;
       Finally, it may be noted that several provinces echoed these reforms and modified their own procedures&#13;
       to appoint judges to their higher courts, replicating to a greater or lesser extent the evolution of the&#13;
       national justice system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          It is important that appointments be mer-             dards and the profile of the judges required.&#13;
     it-based, result from public competition, and              The assignment of scores must be made pursu-&#13;

     Finally, it is fundamental for these processes        reforms described here falls to various actors,&#13;
to be open to the participation of civil society           depending on the respective institutional ar-&#13;

dates. A greater involvement by civil society              jorities required. However, the bodies respon-&#13;
in the judge appointment process enables the               sible for the nomination and appointment of&#13;
scrutiny of citizens.                                      judges can easily self-limit their powers and thus&#13;
     Although these guidelines cannot ful-                 generate instances of participation and improve&#13;

  Box 6.â&#128;&#130; Colombia: Participation in the appointment of judges to the Constitutional Tribunal&#13;
&#13;
  The Constitutional Tribunal is the senior constitutional law court in Colombia. It has nine members who&#13;
  serve for eight years and cannot be reelected. In early 2009, six of the current justices will have completed&#13;
  their term. Each of the six new members will be selected by the National Senate, from a list of three&#13;
  candidates submitted by Colombiaâ&#128;&#153;s President, the Supreme Court of Justice and the State Council.&#13;
&#13;
  Given the impact that the Constitutional Tribunal has had in recent years, a group of Colombian private&#13;
  organizations created ElecciÃ³n Visible (Visible Election), as a citizen oversight coalition to provide monitor-&#13;
  ing and social oversight for the process of selecting the new justices. Their main objective is to demand&#13;
  from the nominators and elector that the eighteen candidates which form the six three-member slates&#13;
  have the best qualities, probity, and independence in exercising judgment; that political agreements&#13;
  play no role in their selection; that there be no filler candidates and that they are all the best possible&#13;
  candidates to fill their positions. Using dynamic resources on their website, the coalition provides citizens&#13;
  with information on the process to select the judges, the importance of the Constitutional Tribunal and&#13;
  the profile and background of the new candidates, among other issues.&#13;
&#13;
  ElecciÃ³n Visible will play a role both at the stage of identification and nomination of candidates by the&#13;
  President, the Supreme Court of Justice and the State Council as well as in the phase of election of the&#13;
  candidates by the Senate. Within the framework of the project, the signing of â&#128;&#156;ethics covenantsâ&#128;&#157; with the&#13;
  nominating agencies has been promoted, in order to ensure transparency in the process of nomination&#13;
  of the candidates and enable society to participate. The Supreme Court, for example, agreed to adopt&#13;
  the transparency measures proposed by the coalition.&#13;

       Box 7.â&#128;&#130; Argentina: Access to Judgesâ&#128;&#153; Financial Disclosure Statements through the Public Ethics Law&#13;
&#13;
       Argentina passed the Public Ethics Law (No. 25.188) in 1999, regulating the exercise of public office. In&#13;
       the Argentine system it is possible to access data such as personal assets by viewing publicly available&#13;
       financial disclosure statements, and in this way also learn the income of public officials. The Public Ethics&#13;
       Law is applicable to all state officials but for several years the Supreme Court considered that it did not&#13;
       apply to the members of the Judiciary. In 2000, the Court issued Ruling 1/2000, excluding the enforce-&#13;
       ment of the Public Ethics Law from the area of the National Judicial Branch.&#13;
&#13;
       It was only in 2005â&#128;&#148;by means of resolution 562/05â&#128;&#148;that the Judicial Council decided to enforce the&#13;
       law with the members of the National Judiciary. That same year, the Supreme Court issued Ruling 30/05,&#13;
       adopting the resolution of the Judicial Council. Nonetheless, access to the financial disclosure statements&#13;
       filed by judges remained extremely difficult, since the rules were not enforced. Finally, in 2007, the Judicial&#13;
       Council regulated the Public Ethics Law (Resolution 734/07), establishing by rule the disclosure of income&#13;
       and asset disclosure statements filed by members of the Judiciary.&#13;
&#13;
       According to the existing regulations, those interested in learning about the assets of judges are required&#13;
       to apply to the chair of the Judicial Council and will gain access to them, with no further proceedings&#13;
       required. The new resolution removed the existing restrictions, which established that the request needed&#13;
       first to be considered by the judge whose assets where being reviewed and it was then decided whether&#13;
       to accept or reject viewing applications in light of any objections raised by the filer.&#13;
&#13;
       It is now provided that â&#128;&#156;any individual [â&#128;¦] will be able to consult and obtain copy of the Public Annex&#13;
       of the Comprehensive Financial Disclosure Statement before the Chair of the National Judicial Council.&#13;
       Applications must be answered in a period of no more than ten business days, without possibility for&#13;
       extension.â&#128;&#157; The ruling adds that â&#128;&#156;once the applicant has made the inquiry, the Chair of the National&#13;
       Judicial Council will inform the judge or official that an application regarding their statement has been&#13;
       processed, also revealing the identity of the applicant.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
       Furthermore, once a year the Council is required to produce a list of the officials and judges required&#13;
       to file financial disclosure statements; publish an updated list of those who have filed their statement or&#13;
       failed to do so; and keep records of the applications for access to assets and income information that&#13;
       have been received. Finally, a list of the information in the statements that would be exempted from dis-&#13;
       closure was considered, but it was decided to include this data as part of a reserved annex, because it is&#13;
       considered â&#128;&#156;sensitive data.â&#128;&#157; Among this sensitive data are the names and surnames of spouses, partners,&#13;
       or minor dependent children, including their relationship and occupation; the names and surnames of&#13;

  Argentina: â&#128;&#156;Court Rulings Within Citizens Reachâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
  Since 2006, AsociaciÃ³n por los Derechos Civiles (ADC) has prepared an annual supplement regarding the&#13;
  most prominent Supreme Court rulings that is published by over twenty national and regional newspapers,&#13;
  with an average total run of 700,000 issues. The main objective is to familiarize readers with the operation&#13;
  of the Supreme Court and learn about the impact of its decisions on citizen rights. This initiative, spon-&#13;
  sored by Argentinaâ&#128;&#153;s Association of Press Entities (ADEPA), also contains an editorial on the performance&#13;
  of the Supreme Court in that year, and graphics on the issues resolved, major data regarding the court,&#13;

  United States: Coverage of Court Cases&#13;
  The prominent work of journalist Linda Greenhouse, from The New York Times, is one of the best examples&#13;
  of a good coverage of a Supreme Court. Recently retired, for many years Greenhouse wrote in-depth&#13;
  articles detailing the relevant and controversial aspects of the issues before the Court. It should be noted&#13;
  that her work was made easier by the fact that at the beginning of every year, the U.S. Supreme Court&#13;
  announces the list of cases it will examine during the period, which allows for study and analysis of the&#13;
  issues beforehand. Her notes not only covered the political and constitutional angles of the cases, but&#13;
  also the human stories behind each of them. Her work was supplemented by the excellent use of images&#13;
  and graphics that contributed not only to capturing the attention of readers, but to explaining in a simple&#13;
  way issues such as the position of each judge regarding the legal and ideological controversies behind&#13;
  the cases, or how the thinking of the Court had evolved over time.&#13;
&#13;
  Regional: Justice and the Media&#13;
  The relationship between the Judicial Branch and the media is a phenomenon that in recent years has&#13;
  received growing attention in many Latin American countries. The failure of judges to communicate their&#13;
  decisions, especially in cases that are complex or have a major public impact, is compounded by the lack&#13;
  of capacity among much of the media to cover judicial issues. This combination of deficits affects the&#13;
  legitimacy of the Judicial Branch and the citizen perception of the justice system. In Peru, for example,&#13;
  the Association of Judges for Justice and Democracy and the Peruvian Press Council supported a proj-&#13;
  ect designed to establish communication channels between the justice system and journalists, enabling&#13;
  the media to understand how the Judiciary operates, but also opening up spaces for judges to better&#13;
  understand the work of the media. For more information see www.justiciaviva.org.pe.&#13;
&#13;
  In Argentina, similar initiatives were started which involved NGOs focused on the justice sector and&#13;
  journalists, and as well as various Judiciaries. Poder Ciudadano, FORES, CIPPEC and ADC have each&#13;
  developed different programs of action oriented toward improving the relationship of the media with&#13;
  the Judiciary. These activities include conducting research, developing manuals on the Judicial Branch&#13;
  for journalists, and organizing discussion workshops. In 2007, the Argentine Journalists Forum (Foro de&#13;
  Periodismo Argentino, FOPEA) signed an agreement with the National Supreme Court to improve citizenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  access to judicial information. The agreement includes developing joint training activities and seminars&#13;
  to analyze the journalistic and communications issues involved in disseminating the work of the courts.&#13;

  Box 11.â&#128;&#130; Argentina: Participation of NGOs in Corruption Cases&#13;
&#13;
  Over the last fifteen years, the Argentine courts have received hundreds of complaints linked to acts of&#13;
  corruption by public officials of various administrations. Still, very few have ended with convictions for&#13;
  those involved. This has contributed to a sense among citizens that there is an unspoken impunity that&#13;
  protects those who get rich in government at the expense of taxpayers. In that context, the ineffective-&#13;
  nessâ&#128;&#148;and in some cases, connivanceâ&#128;&#148;of the Judiciary in resolving such crimes has led to a loss of trust&#13;
  by citizens in in judicial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
  In the face of the above scenario, the Civil Association for Equality and Justice (AsociaciÃ³n Civil por la&#13;
  Igualdad y la Justicia, ACIJ) and the Center for Research and Prevention of Economic Crime (Centro de&#13;
  InvestigaciÃ³n y PrevenciÃ³n contra la Criminalidad EconÃ³mica, CIPCE) launched an initiative designed&#13;
  to gain access to judicial investigations of corruption of national government officials being processed&#13;
  by the Federal Courts of the City of Buenos Aires, where around 80 percent of these types of cases are&#13;
  concentrated. First, they conducted a study of a sample of fifty corruption cases. The preliminary results&#13;
  were alarming: the study found that the average duration of a corruption investigation is fourteen years,&#13;
  counted from the date in which the complaint is filed until its conclusion. Of even greater concern, it was&#13;
  also detected that only a few cases reached the final phase of oral trial, which demonstrates the limited&#13;
  effectiveness of the justice system to handle corruption investigations.&#13;
&#13;
  Secondly, ACIJ and CIPCE tried to gain access to the case files of investigations into corruption crimes,&#13;
  since one of the main problems is that courts systematically deny journalists and NGOs access to such&#13;
  information. The purpose of gaining access to the court files is twofold. On the one hand, the objective&#13;
  is to establish jurisprudence that recognizes such a right for NGOs and journalists. In the event these&#13;
  practices cannot be reverted by means of simple requests to the court authorities, one available resource&#13;
  is strategic litigation on access to information. This needs to be carried out by NGOs and the media.&#13;
&#13;
  On the other hand, having obtained access to the case files, the intention is to gather and analyze all&#13;
  relevant information in order to identify the structural failures by the Judiciary and oversight agencies in&#13;
  carrying out investigations of corruption cases. Simply knowing that the investigations take on average&#13;
  fourteen years is an indicator of the existence of delays, training problems, bottlenecks, and/or other&#13;
  structural problems that prevent their satisfactory processing.&#13;
&#13;
  Although the project is still being executed, it has already achieved some promising results. Recently, the&#13;
  Second Division of the National Criminal and Correctional Federal Appellate Court decided to accept the&#13;
  requests for access to files made by ACIJ and CIPCE, based on the provisions of the international treaties&#13;
  signed by the Republic of Argentina. In effect, the American Convention on Human Rights establishes&#13;
  the publicity of the whole criminal process as a rule, and the United Nations and Inter-American Conven-&#13;
  tions against Corruption, in turn, stipulate that civil society organizations should be ensured an active&#13;
  role in the fight against corruption. This precedent is a valuable first step towards NGOs and journalists&#13;
  gaining effective access to information in cases of investigations of corruption. For more information, see&#13;

       Box 12.â&#128;&#130; Mexico: TV Channel on Judicial Issues&#13;
&#13;
       In July 2006, the Judicial Branch in Mexico began broadcastings from the Judicial Channel, a TV signal&#13;
       that is broadcast by cable providers to the whole country. This innovative initiative emerged in response&#13;
       to requests made by several sectors of society in the National Consultation on a Comprehensive Reform&#13;
       of the Justice System of Mexico, carried out in 2004 and 2005. The findings of this consultation showed&#13;
       that the Federal Judiciary needed to find a better way to ensure transparency in its decisions.&#13;
&#13;
       The creation of the channel was seen by the judicial authorities as a crucial way to reflect, in simple and&#13;
       understandable terms, what the Judiciary is, what it does, and how and to what end it performs its duties&#13;
       through the bodies that make it up. For this reason the Judicial Channel was created, with the objective&#13;
       of disseminating directly and without intermediary the daily workings of the various agencies that make&#13;
       up the Judiciary, such as the Supreme Court of Justice of the Federation, the Federal Judicial Council,&#13;
       Collegiate and Unitary Circuit Courts and the Electoral Tribunal of the Federationâ&#128;&#153;s Judicial Branch, and&#13;
       thus contribute to the strengthening and renewal of a strong legal culture in the country.&#13;
&#13;
       The Judicial Channel has diverse programming, including the live broadcast of the plenum of the Supreme&#13;
       Court Justices, some sessions of the Electoral Tribunal and relevant hearings that are held by various&#13;
       lower courts. There are also segments dedicated to Law schools, and programs with news and interviews&#13;
       related to the judicial profession. Among other major discussions, the Judicial Channel carried the debate&#13;
       on the constitutionality of the Federal Telecommunications (LFT) and Radio and Television Laws (LFRT).&#13;

  Box 15.â&#128;&#130; Costa Rica: New Code of Penal Procedure&#13;
&#13;
  The new Code of Penal Procedure in Costa Rica represents a model of penal procedure with accusatory&#13;
  characteristics. The applicable provisions establish, in principle, a reasonable regulation of the right of&#13;
  television coverage during a trial while also taking into account the protection of other interests that may&#13;
  be in conflict with coverage. Article 330 establishes the principle of publicity of the trial as the rule but also&#13;
  allows the total or partial holding of the trial behind closed doors in the event that a number of situations&#13;
  present themselves: a) when coverage directly affects the privacy or physical safety of any of the parties&#13;
  involved; b) when it seriously affects state security or the interests of justice; c) when it places in danger&#13;
  an official, private, commercial, or industrial secret, the undue disclosure of which is penalized; d) when&#13;
  contemplated in a specific rule; and e) when deposing an individual and the tribunal deems publicity&#13;
  inconvenient, particularly in the cases that involve of sex offenses or statements by minors. Once the&#13;
  cause for not making public the proceedings is no longer relevant, the rules expressly stipulate that the&#13;
  public will again be allowed to enter the room and the chairperson of the proceedings will briefly report&#13;
  what has transpired if the tribunal so decides it. What is innovative is the content of the following article,&#13;
  which regulates the relationship between the principle of publicity and the presence of the media in the&#13;
  courtroom: Art. 331-Participation of the Media: â&#128;&#156;To inform the public of the events in the courtroom,&#13;
  radio and television broadcasters may install in the courtroom equipment for recording, photography,&#13;
  radio broadcasting, filming or other mediums. The court will determine, in each case, the conditions&#13;
  under which such powers will be exercised. It will, however, through a well founded resolution, have the&#13;
  power to prohibit such installation when it hinders the development of the debate or affects any of the&#13;
  interests mentioned in the previous article.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
  If the offender, the victim or somebody who has to provide evidence expressly request that these com-&#13;
  panies not record their image and voice, the tribunal will uphold their rights.&#13;

       Mexico&#13;
       Between April and July 2008, Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s Supreme Court of Justice conducted a series of six public hearings&#13;
       in the framework of a case that examined the constitutionality of abortion. In a process that stirred a major&#13;
       debate in Mexican society, the Court analyzed the reforms introduced in 2007 by the Federal Districtâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       Legislative Assembly, allowing free access to abortion at the simple request of women in Mexico City&#13;
       during the first quarter of pregnancy. The hearings were held to hear the positions of the groups in favor&#13;
       and against the law. Both the hearings and the sessions of the Court were recorded and are availableâ&#128;&#148;not&#13;
       only in video format but also as transcripts and summariesâ&#128;&#148;on a website set up by the Supreme Court&#13;
       to allow for an adequate monitoring of the case by citizens. Using this mechanism, the Court adequately&#13;
       informed society of the development of the process that was followed in order to resolve a sensitive issue&#13;

       three levels of government involved in its solution and it comprises the population of the two most highly&#13;
       populated districts in the countryâ&#128;&#148;the Court resorted to public hearings to gather information from the&#13;
       various stakeholders, listen to the damaged parties, and analyze possible solutions. A series of meetings&#13;
       were held between 2006 and 2008, where, for example, the Court ordered the development of education&#13;
       and public information programs on the issue, and studies of the environmental impact produced by all&#13;
       the companies operating in the affected areas were required. Likewise, the Court requested that the 44&#13;
       companies publish details regarding what substances they are discharging into the river, whether systems&#13;
       were in place for the treatment of pollutants, and whether the companies held insurance to guarantee&#13;
       the redress of potential damages. In all cases, the public and the media filled the courtroom. Finally, in&#13;
       July 2008, the Court handed down its sentence, ordering a long list of comprehensive measures to repair&#13;
       and prevent environmental damage.&#13;

  Box 17.â&#128;&#130; Argentina: The Use of Amicus Curiae by the Supreme Court&#13;
&#13;
  This mechanism, which also exists in some superior courts of a number of Argentine provincesâ&#128;&#148;such as,&#13;
  for example, the Superior Tribunal of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (Section 22, Law 402)â&#128;&#148;was&#13;
  accepted by the National Supreme Court in 2004. Basing its application on national and international&#13;
  rules, the Court underlined that â&#128;&#156;it considered appropriate that, in the pending cases before its court and&#13;
  in which matters of institutional import or public interest are examined, intervention should be authorized&#13;
  as Friends of the Court, to third parties that have a recognized competence on the issue examined and&#13;
  demonstrate an unequivocal interest in the final resolution of the caseâ&#128;&#157; (Resolution 28/2004).&#13;
&#13;
  Given the great number of cases that, generally, are heard by the provincial higher courts, it should be&#13;
  noted that the use of the Amici is not recommended for all cases, but only in those that deal with ground-&#13;
  breaking issues because of their legal, social, economic, or political implications.&#13;
&#13;
  Publicity and transparency in the operation of the courts is a fundamental requirement for the effectiveness&#13;
  of the concept of Amicus curiae. The Argentine Federal Court, for example, has, since 2006, published&#13;
  on its website the cases which, due to their constitutional significance, are eligible for a third party pre-&#13;
  sentation. This is a simply implemented system. In this case it was provided by means of a resolution (an&#13;
  administrative rule issued by the Court itself) although it should be noted that in other cases (for example,&#13;
  in the Argentine province of RÃ­o Negro) it has been implemented by a law passed in the local Legislature.&#13;

       The Legal Defense Institute and the Law School of The Catholic University of Peru joined efforts to create&#13;
       the Consortium Justicia Viva (Live Justice), an endeavor designed to monitor the situation of the Judiciary&#13;
       in order to be better equipped to advocate for the fundamental changes necessary to rehaul the justice&#13;
       system in this Andean country. The Consortium conducts a comprehensive monitoring of the operation&#13;
       of all the instances of the Judiciary, combining the research typical of academic institutions with proposals&#13;
       for political and institutional reforms. It also has a website that contains a large number of publications&#13;
       and documents analyzing the justice system. For more information, see www.justiciaviva.org.pe.&#13;

&#13;
  Currently, judicial observatories are a tool designed and used by civil society to exercise oversight of the&#13;
  regionâ&#128;&#153;s Judiciaries. They operate under different formats and their composition is heterogeneous. There&#13;
  are observatories created by civil society groups, universities and research centers, or by a coalition of a&#13;
  number of these groups. They also differ in terms of objectives. While some are aimed at overseeing all&#13;
  the activities of the Judiciary, others only cover a specific judicial body. Their thematic coverage also var-&#13;
  ies, since they may focus on a concrete areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, family courtsâ&#128;&#148;or comprise all law specialties.&#13;

  Box 20.â&#128;&#130; Peru: Social Audit of the Judiciary&#13;
&#13;
  Since 2005, The Commission of Andean Jurists (ComisiÃ³n Andina de Juristas, CAJ) is developing a So-&#13;
  cial Audit project in the nine main Supreme Courts of Justice in Peru, with the purpose of strengthening&#13;
  judicial independence and improving the legitimacy of the bodies responsible for the administration of&#13;
  justice. This project promotes an open and transparent justice system that includes citizens in its activities,&#13;
  especially in the processes of evaluation of judicial decisions. In addition, it hopes to generate a flow of&#13;
  consistent and ongoing information from the Judicial Branch towards citizens.&#13;
&#13;
  The project was implemented by creating Justice System Social Audit Committees (ComitÃ©s de Audi-&#13;
  torÃ­a Social al Sistema de Justicia, CASSJ), operated mainly by university students with the logistic and&#13;
  infrastructure support of public and private universities. The CASSJ were trained to make contact with&#13;
  judges willing to be audited by civil society (known as â&#128;&#156;transparent judgesâ&#128;&#157;), who, on a voluntary basis,&#13;
  agreed to disclose both personal information as well as information relating to professional performance&#13;
  in their jurisdiction. Currently, approximately 65 judges at various levels (first instance, appeals and superior&#13;
  court) have joined the project.&#13;
&#13;
  Among the main outcomes of the project is the development of a databank containing information&#13;
  on the background of the judges who supported the initiative; publication on the Internet of copies of&#13;
  all the sentences and resolutions they have passed; and the creation of discussion forums on the most&#13;
  important issues of the justice system.&#13;

    judges should respect the same standards in terms           the courts. For example, the use of Amici curiae&#13;

&amp;#12;About the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice&#13;
Governance is one of seven priority themes in the World Bank Instituteâ&#128;&#153;s recently launched renewal strat-&#13;
egyâ&#128;&#148;a strategy that responds to client demand for peer-to-peer learning by grounding WBIâ&#128;&#153;s work in the&#13;
distillation and dissemination of practitioner experiences. The Institute is committed to building knowledge&#13;
and capacity on the â&#128;&#156;how toâ&#128;&#157; of governance reforms, with emphasis on supporting and sustaining multi-&#13;
stakeholder engagement in bringing about such reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WBIâ&#128;&#153;s Governance Practice works with partners, including networks of country and regional institutions, to&#13;
develop and replicate customized learning programs. Its programmatic approach aims at building multi-&#13;
stakeholder coalitions and in creating collaborative platforms and peer networks for knowledge exchange.&#13;
&#13;
The Practice focuses on three thematic areas: governance of extractive industries, procurement reform,&#13;
and access to information. A fourth program supports anti-corruption programs for Parliamentarians, the&#13;
Judiciary and the Private Sector. A Mobilizing Stakeholders for Reform group links stakeholder groups in&#13;
support of these priority areas, documents and codifies knowledge, and builds capacity in cross-cutting&#13;
areas. And lastlyâ&#128;&#148;but importantlyâ&#128;&#148;a Leadership Development Program focuses on strengthening the ca-&#13;
pacity of potential leaders to harness the energies of stakeholder groups and to and channel these efforts&#13;
toward reform.&#13;

            Access to information and transparency in
            the judiciary : a guide to good practices from Latin America
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Current research conducted from a
            political science and law perspective has documented a broad
            participation of the judiciary in the process of public
            policy development, in the recognition and protection of
            rights, and in controlling other state powers. This document
            includes a compilation of practices intended to promote
            access to information and transparency in the various areas
            of operation of the justice system, in particular the
            judiciary, promoting an operation that is more democratic,
            and open to citizens. To this end, the authors approached
            the analysis by taking into account two dimensions: access
            to information and transparency regarding the administrative
            functioning of the judiciary, as well as its jurisdictional
            functions. The potential for access to information and
            transparency reforms to help reverse that situation are
            highlighted. Section one gives executive summary, section
            two gives introduction. Sections three and four include an
            introduction to the context in which the judiciary operates
            in Latin America, identifying the most relevant challenges
            it faces. Section five analyzes access to various categories
            of information related to the administrative operation of
            the judiciary. Section six deals with information categories
            related to the jurisdictional operation of the judiciary.
            Section seven concludes.
