            logjam in Colombia

        <abstracts>
            Many developing countries suffer from
            logjam in the courts, a condition that tends to reduce the
            effectiveness of bankruptcy law in relieving financial
            distress. Colombia's bankruptcy reform provides some
            useful lessons for these countries. In particular, it shows
            that when traditional court procedures are hard to change,
            an alternative is to legally empower another entity to
            handle the entire process. The author explains how it was
            done in Colombia.
