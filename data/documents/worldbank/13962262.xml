IFe   finance Corporation&#13;
      \/,v{yld 8ar,k Group&#13;
&amp;#12;I.       OVERVIEW&#13;
International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an intemational organization, established in 1956, to further economic growth in its&#13;
developing member countries by promoting private sector development. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which&#13;
also comprises the Intemational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the Intemational Development Association&#13;
(IDA), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the Intemational Centre for Settlement of Investment&#13;
Disputes (ICSID). It is a legal entity separate and distinct from IBRD, IDA, MIGA, and ICSID, with its own Articles of&#13;
Agreement, share capital, financial structure, management, and staff. Membership in IFC is open only to member countries of&#13;
IBRD. As of June 30, 2008, IFC's entire share capital was held by 179 member countries.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's principal investment products are loans and equity investments, with smaller debt securities and guarantee portfoliOS.&#13;
IFC also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or&#13;
through loan participations, underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project finance, corporate lending and resource&#13;
mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial products and advisory services to private businesses in the developing world to&#13;
increase their chances of success. It also advises govemments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of&#13;
private enterprise and foreign investment. Unlike most multilateral development institutions, IFC does not accept host&#13;
govemment guarantees of its exposures. IFC raises virtually all of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance of&#13;
debt obligations in the international capital markets, while maintaining a small borrowing window with IBRD. Equity&#13;
investments are funded from net worth. During the year ended June 30, 2008 (FY08), IFC had an authorized borrowing&#13;
program of up to $6.0 billion, including $1.0 billion to allow for possible prefunding during FY08 of the funding program for the&#13;
year ending June 30, 2009 (FY09).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's capital base and its assets and liabilities, other than its equity investments, are primarily denominated in US dollars. IFC&#13;
seeks to minimize foreign exchange and interest rate risks by closely matching the currency, rate bases, and maturity of its&#13;
liabilities in various currencies with assets having the same characteristics. IFC manages any non-equity investment related&#13;
residual currency and interest rate risks by utilizing currency and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.&#13;

The Management Discussion and Analysis contains forward looking statements which may be identified by such terms as&#13;
"anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans" or words of similar meaning. Such statements involve a number of&#13;
assumptions and estimates that are based on current expectations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties beyond IFC's&#13;
control. Consequently, actual future results could differ materially from those currently anticipated.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.      FINANCIAL SUMMARY&#13;
Basis of preparation of IFe's consolidated financial statements&#13;
&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of IFe conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US&#13;
GAAP).&#13;
&#13;
Up to and including the year ended June 30, 1999, IFe prepared one set of financial statements and footnotes, complying with&#13;
both US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, principally due to material differences&#13;
between US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and&#13;
Hedging Activities, as amended (collectively SFAS No. 133), and its counterpart in IFRS, lAS No. 39, Financial Instruments&#13;
Recognition and Measurement, it has not been possible for IFe to satisfy the requirements of both US GAAP and IFRS via one&#13;
set of financial statements since the year ended June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
IFe is actively monitoring developments related to accounting standards and the primary basis for preparation of its&#13;
consolidated financial statements, all with a view to the necessary systems and controls to manage its various lines of&#13;
business. IFe will present its consolidated financial statements for FY09 in accordance with US GAAP. IFe continues to plan&#13;
to transition from US GAAP to IFRS and plans to re-evaluate the timetable for this transition during FY09. During FY08, IFe&#13;
has implemented new accounting pronouncements that have expanded the use of fair values in its FY08 consolidated financial&#13;
statements, broadly consistent with its planned overall approach to the transition to IFRS. The changes are discussed in more&#13;
detail in Notes A and X to IFe's FY08 consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Unless stated otherwise, discussions of financial performance herein refer to income after: (i) expenditures for advisory&#13;
services; (ii) expenditures for performance-based grants (PSG); and (iii) grants to IDA (operating income). Operating income&#13;
excludes the effects of net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value.&#13;
The effects of net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value are&#13;
discussed in Section VII.&#13;

&amp;#12;Financial performance summary&#13;
&#13;
As disclosed more fully in Note Y to IFe's FY08 consolidated financial statements and in Section VII, Results of Operations,&#13;
IFe has restated previously reported results. Where applicable in the Management's Discussion and Analysis, references to&#13;
prior period information have also been restated.&#13;
&#13;
From year to year, IFe's operating income is affected by a number of factors, principally income generated from its equity&#13;
investment portfolio (principally dividends, realized capital gains on equity sales and, beginning in FY08, unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on equity investments); the magnitude of provisions for losses against its loans and guarantees; impairment of equity&#13;
investments; loans in nonaccrual status; and recoveries of interest on loans formerly in nonaccrual status. A significant part of&#13;
IFe's liquid assets trading portfolio is invested in fixed income securities, including asset-backed securities, which are also&#13;
subject to external market factors that affect the value of such securities, adding variability to operating income. Net income&#13;
comprises operating income together with net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments&#13;
accounted for at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
IFe has been profitable since its inception in 1956, and recorded operating income for FY08 of $1 ,438 million, as compared&#13;
with $2,589 million for the year ended June 30, 2007 (FY07), and $1,409 million for the year ended June 30, 2006 (FY06).&#13;
Operating income in FYOB while $1,151 million lower than the record high reported in FY07, reflects strong contributions across&#13;
each of IFe's main product lines: loans, equities, debt securities, and treasury operations in a challenging global economy. IFe&#13;
reported net income in FYOB, including net unrealized gains on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair&#13;
value, of $1,547 million, as compared with $2,490 million for FY07 and $1,264 million for FY06.&#13;
&#13;
IFe's operating and net income for the past five fiscal years ended June 30, are presented below:&#13;

&#13;
Business overview&#13;
&#13;
In partnership with private investors, IFC assists in financing the establishment, improvement, and expansion of private sector&#13;
enterprises by making investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC seeks&#13;
to bring together domestic and foreign private capital and experienced management and thereby create conditions conducive&#13;
to the flow of private capital (domestiC and foreign) into productive investments in its developing member countries. In this&#13;
way, IFC plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional funding from other investors and lenders through parallel loans, loan&#13;
partiCipations, partial credit guarantees, securitizations and risk sharing facilities (resource mobilization). In addition to project&#13;
finance, corporate lending and resource mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial products and advisory services to private&#13;
businesses in the developing world with a view to fulfilling its developmental mission. IFC also advises member governments&#13;
on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and t:&gt;reign investment.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's strategiC priorities comprise: (i) strengthening the focus on frontier markets, including small and medium enterprises and&#13;
agribusiness; (ii) building long-term partnerships with emerging players in developing countries; (iii) addressing climate change,&#13;
and environment and social sustainability activities; (iv) addressing constraints to private sector growth in infrastructure, health,&#13;
and education; and (v) developing local financial markets through institution building, the use of innovative financial products&#13;
and mobilization. IFC's strategic pillars are aligned with World Bank Group priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Investments&#13;
IFC's investments are normally made in its developing member countries. The Articles of Agreement mandate that IFC shall&#13;
invest in productive private enterprise. The requirement for private ownership does not disqualify enterprises that are partly&#13;
owned by the public sector if such enterprises are organized under local commercial and corporate law, operate free of host&#13;
government control in a market context and according to profitability criteria, and/or are in the process of being totally or&#13;
partially privatized.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's main investment activity is project and corporate finanCing. This encompasses "greenfield" projects, expansions, and&#13;
modernizations. IFC also provides financing to selected companies for ongoing investment programs. In addition, IFC&#13;
facilitates financing through financial intermediaries, covering project and general purpose lending and specialized lending&#13;
products such as leasing, trade, and mortgage finance. These financial intermediaries function either as IFC's borrower, on-&#13;
lending to private sector companies at their own riSk, or as IFC's agent, identifying companies for direct loans from IFC.&#13;
&#13;
IFC applies stringent tests of enterprise soundness, project viability, additionality, and developmental impact in determining the&#13;
eligibility of projects for its investments.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investment cycle can be divided into twelve main stages:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Business development&#13;
       Early review&#13;
       Appraisal (due diligence)&#13;
  ·    Investment review&#13;
  ·    Negotiations&#13;
  ·    Public notification&#13;
  ·    Board of Directors' review and approval&#13;
  ·    Commitment&#13;
  ·    Disbursement&#13;
  ·    Project supervision&#13;
  ·    Evaluation&#13;
  ·    Closing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC carefully supervises its projects to monitor project performance and compliance with contractual obligations and with IFC's&#13;
internal policies and procedures. IFC's Board of Directors (Board or Board of Directors) is informed of such matters and of&#13;
recommended courses of action at regular intervals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS. PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO                 5&#13;
&amp;#12;Advisory services&#13;
IFe has historically delivered its mission primarily through loans, equity investments, and debt securities. As a result of an&#13;
enhanced focus on frontier markets and achievement of sustainable development impact, the demands on IFe for associated&#13;
advisory work have increased significantly. Advisory services are an important and growing part of IFe's business, contributing&#13;
significantly to IFe's additionality by improving the business enabling environment for the private sector as well as the&#13;
capabilities of private firms and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
IFe's advisory services cycle can be divided into six main stages:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       ·   Business development&#13;
       ·   Early review&#13;
           Appraisal&#13;

Loans&#13;
Loans generally have the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
      Term: typically amortizing with final maturities of up to 12 years&#13;
      Currency: primarily in major convertible currencies, principally US dollar, and to a lesser extent, Euro, Swiss franc,&#13;
      and Japanese yen, but with a growing local currency loan portfolio&#13;
  ·   Interest rate: typically variable (or fixed and swapped into variable)&#13;
  ·   Pricing: reflects such factors as market conditions and country and project risks; variable rate loans are generally&#13;
      tied to the 6-month UBOR index in the relevant currency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's loans traditionally have been made in major currencies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
countries, based on client demand and on IFC's ability to hedge loans in these currencies through the use of mechanisms such&#13;
as cross-currency swaps or forward contracts. Fixed-rate loans and loans in currencies other than US dollars are normally&#13;
transformed, using currency and/or interest rate swaps, into US dollar variable rate loans.&#13;
&#13;
There has been a growing demand for IFC to offer local currency products. IFC typically offers local currency products in other&#13;
currencies where it can hedge the local currency loan cash flows back into US dollars using swap markets. Beginning in FY08,&#13;
IFC has further enhanced its local currency loan product to provide clients with the flexibility of having variable-rate local&#13;
currency loans funded prior to loan disbursement. IFC's disbursed loan portfolio at June 30, 2008 includes $1.7 billion of loans&#13;
denominated in Russian ruble, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah, Brazilian real, and Mexican peso.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's disbursed loan portfolio totaled $15.3 billion at June 30, 2008 ($12.7 billion at June 30, 2007). The carrying value of&#13;
IFC's loan portfoliO (comprising the disbursed loan portfolio together with fair value adjustments, the unamortized SFAS No.&#13;
133 transition adjustment, unamortized deferred loan Origination fees, net, and net of reserves against losses) grew 21.7% to&#13;
$14.4 billion at June 30, 2008 ($11.8 billion at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Loans comprise 73% of the disbursed investment portfolio as of June 30, 2008 (78% at June 30, 2007) and 63% of the&#13;
carrying value of the investment portfolio (76% at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2008, 69% (73% at June 30, 2007) of IFC's disbursed loan portfolio was US dollar-denominated.&#13;

&amp;#12;Equity investments&#13;
IFe's equity investments are typically in the form of common or preferred stock which is not mandatorily redeemable by the&#13;
issuer or puttable to the issuer by IFe and are usually denominated in the currency of the country in which the investment is&#13;
made.&#13;
&#13;
IFe's disbursed equity portfolio totaled $4.3 billion at June 30, 2008 ($2.9 billion at June 30, 2007), an increase of 46%.&#13;
&#13;
The carrying value of IFe's equity investment portfolio (comprising the disbursed equity portfolio, net of impairment write-&#13;
downs, together with fair value adjustments, unrealized gains on equity investments held by consolidated variable interest&#13;
entities (VIEs) and, prior to FY08, adjustments to investments accounted for under the equity method), grew 126% to $7.3&#13;
billion at June 30, 2008 ($3.2 billion at June 30, 2007). IFe adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB)&#13;

Liabilities (SFAS No. 159) and SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157) effective July 1, 2007. As a result,&#13;
the carrying value of the equity portfolio on July 1, 2007 increased by $3.2 billion, reflecting unrealized gains on equity&#13;
investments at that time. At June 30, 2008, the carrying value of equity investments included $3.0 billion of unrealized gains.&#13;
In addition, unrealized gains on IFe's equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment and, in FY07 only, unrealized&#13;
gains on equity investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $3.7 billion at June 30, 2008 ($6.5 billion at June&#13;
30,2007). Accordingly, the total fair value of IFe's equity portfolio was $11.0 billion at June 30,2008 ($9.7 billion at June 30,&#13;
2007).&#13;
&#13;
The adoption of SFAS No. 159 and SFAS No. 157 is described in more detail in Notes A and X to IFe's FY08 consolidated&#13;

&#13;
Debt securities&#13;
Debt securities are typically in the form of bonds and notes issued in bearer or registered form, securitized debt obligations&#13;
(e.g., asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other collateralized debt obligations) and preferred shares,&#13;
which are mandatorily redeemable by the issuer or puttable to the issuer by IFe.&#13;

securities on IFe's consolidated balance sheet as appropriate depending on their characteristics. Quasi-equities include&#13;
subordinated or convertible loans, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, and certain common or preferred&#13;
shares with put and/or call features. At June 30,2008, IFe's disbursed quasi-equity portfolio totaled $3,424 million ($2.725&#13;
million at June 30, 2007). of which $2.679 million was classified as loans ($2,416 million at June 30, 2007). $69 million was&#13;

&amp;#12;Resource mobilization&#13;
Resource mobilization is defined as financing from entities other than IFC that becomes available to clients due to IFC's direct&#13;
involvement in raising resources. IFC finances only a portion, usually not more than 25%, of the cost of any project. All IFC-&#13;
financed projects, therefore, require other financial partners. IFC mobilizes such private sector finance from other entities&#13;
through participations, parallel loans, partial credit guarantees, securitizations, and risk sharing facilities.&#13;
&#13;
B~loans&#13;
The principal direct means by which IFC mobilizes such private sector finance is through the sale of participations in its loans&#13;
(B-Ioans), known as the ~Ioan program. Through the B-Ioan program, IFC has worked primarily with commercial banks but&#13;
also with nonbank financial institutions in financing projects since the early 1960s.&#13;
&#13;
Whenever it participates a loan, IFC will always make a loan for its own account (an A-loan), thereby sharing the risk alongside&#13;
its loan participants. IFC acts as the lender of record and is responsible for the administration of the entire loan, including the S-&#13;
loan. IFC charges fees to the borrower at prevailing market rates to cover the cost of the syndication of the ~Ioan.&#13;
&#13;
B-Ioan commitments were $3,250 million in FY08 ($1,775 million in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
Structured finance&#13;
Structured finance comprises partial credit guarantees, securitizations and risk sharing facilities. Structured finance&#13;
commitments, net, defined as the amount of financing with a risk position equal to, or senior to, that of IFC's risk participation in&#13;
the transaction, totaled $1,403 million in FY08 ($2,083 million in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
Parallel loans&#13;
Loans from other finanCial institutions that IFC helped raise for clients and received a fee, but for which IFC is not the lender of&#13;
record, arranged by IFC in FY08 were $40 million ($29 million in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
Resource mobilization ratio&#13;
The resource mobilization ratio is defined as:&#13;
&#13;
                     Loan participations + parallel loans + non-IFC investment portion of structured finance&#13;
                             Commitments (IFC investments + IFC portion of structured finance)&#13;
&#13;
For each dollar that IFC committed, IFC mobilized (in the form of B-Ioans, parallel loans, and the    non~IFC   portion of structured&#13;
finance) $0.42 in FY08 ($0.47 in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
Client risk managementproducts&#13;
IFC provides derivative products to its clients to allow them to hedge their interest rate, currency or commodity price&#13;
exposures. IFC intermediates between its developing country clients and derivatives market makers in order to provide IFC's&#13;
clients with full market access to risk management products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Advisoty services&#13;
Advisory services are an important and growing part of IFC's business. Advisory services contribute significantly to IFC's&#13;
additionality by improving the business enabling environment for the private sector as well as the capabilities of private firms&#13;
and service providers. IFC provides such services to promote sustainable private sector investment in developing countries.&#13;
Through this work, which is funded in partnership with governments and other donors, IFC contributes to development where&#13;
opportunities for development may be limited. Beginning in FY07, IFC's advisory services are organized into five business&#13;
lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Business Enabling Environment: to improve the business environment that will allow projects to be viable.&#13;
       Access to Finance: to expand on the availability of financial services to micro and small businesses and low-&#13;
       income households.&#13;
  ·    Corporate Advice: to improve the business capability of private sector companies (particularly in countries&#13;
       where IFC currently has limited opportunities to provide investment finance).&#13;
       Environment and Social Sustainability: to improve the sustainability of IFC clients and through them&#13;
       demonstrate innovative environmental and social business models to the market.&#13;
  ·    Infrastructure: to improve access to basic services in road infrastructure, telecommunications, water, energy&#13;
       utilities, health, and education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's expenditures for advisory services totaled $123 million in FY08 ($96 million in FY07 and $55 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   projects in FY07), with funding of $306 million ($386 million in FY07). The average planned duration of advisory service&#13;
   projects now exceeds 24 months, unchanged from FY07. The average size of new projects exceeds $1 million, unchanged&#13;
   from FY07.&#13;
&#13;

Liquid assets&#13;
&#13;
IFe invests its liquidity in highly rated fixed and floating rate instruments issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by,&#13;
governments, government agencies and instrumentalities, multilateral organizations, and AM-rated corporate issuers; these&#13;
include mortgage- and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and other unconditional obligations of banks and financial&#13;
institutions. IFe manages the market risk associated with these investments through a variety of hedging techniques including&#13;
derivatives, principally currency and interest rate swaps and financial futures.&#13;
&#13;
IFe's liquid assets are invested in six separate portfolios, internally named PO through P4 and P6. The P6 portfolio was&#13;
created in FY08 in support of IFe's local currency lending capabilities. The P6 portfolio contains the proceeds of liquidity&#13;
raised in local currency prior to disbursement and is managed against various local indices. At June 30, 2008 this portfolio&#13;
contained short-term Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Mexican peso holdings.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
&#13;
The major source of IFC's borrowings is the international capital markets. Under the Articles of Agreement, IFC may borrow in&#13;
the public markets of a member country only with approvals from that member and also the member in whose currency the&#13;
borrowing is denominated. IFC borrowed $6.3 billion during FY08 ($2.8 billion in FY07 and $1.8 billion in FY06). The significant&#13;
growth in borrowings in FY08 when compared to FY07 reflects the growth of investment portfolio commitments in FY08. In&#13;
addition, IFC's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase and/or redemption of debt obligations issued by IFC. During&#13;
FY08, IFC repurchased and retired $43 million of outstanding debt ($16 million in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
IFC diversifies its borrowings by currency, country, source, and maturity to provide flexibility and cost-effectiveness. In FY08&#13;
IFC borrowed in nine currencies and in final maturities ranging from 1 to 30 years. Outstanding market borrowings have&#13;
remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to almost 30 years, with a weighted average remaining contractual&#13;
maturity of 8.7 years at June 30, 2008 (9.8 years at June 30,2007). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities&#13;
due to the existence of call features in certain of IFC's borrowings. IFC has a developmental role in helping open up new&#13;
domestic markets to foreign issuers in its member countries. In this role, IFC was the first non-resident institution to borrow in&#13;
the domestic market in Brazil in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
Market borrowings are generally swapped into floating-rate obligations denominated in US dollars. As of June 30, 2008, IFC&#13;
had gross payables from borrowing-related currency swaps of $12.2 billion ($8.8 billion at June 30,2007) and from borrowing-&#13;
related interest rate swaps in the notional principal amount of $7.7 billion ($6.7 billion at June 30, 2007). After the effect of&#13;
these derivative instruments is taken into conSideration, 98% of IFC's market borrowings at June 30. 2008. (98% at June 30.&#13;
2007), were variable rate US dollar-denominated. IFC's mandate to help develop domestic capital markets can result in&#13;
providing local currency funds for onlending to its clients rather than being swapped into US dollars. At June 30. 2008, $0.4&#13;
billion of non-US dollar-denominated market borrowings in Chinese renminbi and C.FA franc were used for such purposes. In&#13;
addition, the proceeds of the Brazilian real borrowing in FY08 funded a non-investment portfolio loan as opposed to being&#13;
swapped into US dollars.&#13;
&#13;
The weighted average cost of market borrowings after currency and interest rate swap transactions was 2.8% at June 30. 2008&#13;
(5.0% at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO              13&#13;
&amp;#12;Capital and retained earnings&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2008, IFC's net worth (presented as Total Capital in IFC's consolidated balance sheet) amounted to $18.3&#13;
billion, up from the June 30, 2007 level of $14.0 billion. At June 30, 2008, net worth comprised $2.4 billion of paid-in capital,&#13;
unchanged from June 30, 2007, $13.2 billion of retained earnings ($11.2 billion at June 30, 2007), and $2.7 billion of&#13;
accumulated other comprehensive income ($0.4 billion at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
As of June 30, 2008 and 2007, IFC's authorized capital was $2.45 billion, of which $2.37 billion was subscribed. Over 99% of&#13;
this was paid in ($2.37 billion at June 30, 2008, $2.37 billion at June 30, 2007). IFC has agreed to defer the payment dates for&#13;
certain member countries. Pursuant to these arrangements, less than $1 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June&#13;
30, 2008 ($1 million at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Designations ofretained earnings&#13;
In the year ended June 30, 2004 (FY04), IFC began a process of designating retained earnings to increase its support of&#13;
advisory services and, subsequently, for performance-based grants (year ended June 30, 2005 (FY05)), grants to IDA (FY06),&#13;
the Global Infrastructure Project Development Fund (FY08), and Micro Equity Funds in IDA Countries (FY08). The levels and&#13;
purposes of retained earnings designations are set based on Board-approved principles, which are applied each year to&#13;
assess IFC's financial capacity and to determine the maximum levels of retained earnings designations.&#13;
&#13;
Amounts available to be designated are determined based on IFC's annual operating income in excess of $150 million,&#13;
contemplating the financial capacity and priorities of IFC, and are approved by IFC's Board of Directors. ExpendibJres for the&#13;
various approved designations are recorded as expenses in IFC's consolidated income statement in the year in which they&#13;
occur, and have the effect of reducing retained earnings designated for this specific purpose.&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2008, retained earnings comprised $12.4 billion of undesignated retained earnings ($10.6 billion at June 30, 2007),&#13;
$0.4 billion of retained earnings designated for advisory services ($0.4 billion at June 30, 2007), $0.2 billion of retained&#13;
earnings designated for PBG ($0.2 billion at June 30, 2007), $0.1 billion of retained earnings designated for the Global&#13;
Infrastructure Project Development Fund ($0 at June 30, 2007) and $0.1 billion for micro equity funds for Small and Medium&#13;
Enterprise Development in IDA countries ($0 at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Advisorv services&#13;
As of June 30, 2007, IFC's Board of Directors had approved designations in the cumulative amount of $580 million of IFC's&#13;
retained earnings for advisory services. On September 27,2007, IFC's Board of Directors approved an additional designation&#13;
of $170 million of IFC's retained earnings. This designation of retained earnings was noted with approval by the Board of&#13;
Governors on October 22,2007. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006 (FY06), IFC had incurred cumulative expenditures for&#13;
advisory services of $38 million. IFC incurred expenditures for advisory services of $55 million in FY06, $96 million in FY07,&#13;
and $123 million in FY08. Retained earnings designated for advisory services at June 30,2008 totaled $438 million.&#13;
&#13;
On August 7,2008, IFC's Board of Directors approved a further designation of $100 million of IFC's retained earnings for&#13;
advisory services, which is expected to be noted with approval by the Board of Governors and thereby concluded in FY09.&#13;
&#13;
Grants to IDA&#13;
In order to encourage the growth of productive private enterprise in countries that are members of both IFC and IDA, on August&#13;
7,2006, IFC's Board of Directors approved the designation of $150 million for grants to IDA. On February 27,2007, IFC&#13;
disbursed $150 million in grants to IDA and recorded an expense of $150 million in its FY07 consolidated income statement.&#13;
On September 27,2007, IFC's Board of Directors approved the designation of $500 million for a private sector development&#13;
grant program for the IDA 15 replenishment. This designation of retained earnings was noted with approval by the Board of&#13;
Governors on October 22,2007. On March 18,2008, IFC and IDA signed an agreement whereby IFC agreed to provide a&#13;
grant to IDA in the amount of $500 million for IDA to use in providing financing in the form of grants in addition to loans, all in&#13;
furtherance of IFC's purpose as stated in its Articles of Agreement. Accordingly, IFC recorded a grant expense in the amount&#13;
of $500 million in its FY08 consolidated income statement. The grant was disbursed to IDA on July 1, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's Board has approved, in principle, an indicative program for grants to IDA for the IDA 15 replenishment of up to $1,250&#13;
million funded by designations of retained earnings from FY08 through the year ending June 30, 2010 (FY10). This amount is&#13;
subject to availability of IFC funds and Board approval in each year. On August 7,2008, IFC's Board of Directors approved the&#13;
designation of an additional $450 million for grants to IDA; this designation is expected to be noted with approval by the Board&#13;
of Governors and thereby concluded in FY09, leaving a remaining indicative program of up to $800 million.&#13;

&amp;#12;Performance-based grants&#13;
As of June 30, 2007, IFe's Board of Directors had approved designations of $250 million of IFe's retained earnings for&#13;
performance-based grants, targeted at specific industries in developing countries, particularly furthering IFe's frontier strategy&#13;
by opening new opportunities to generate developmental impact. IFe incurred expenditures for performance-based grants of&#13;
$35 million in FY06, $0 in FY07, and $27 million in FY08. thereby reducing the amount of retained earnings designated for&#13;
performance-based grants at June 30, 2008 to $188 million.&#13;
&#13;
Other&#13;
On September 27,2007, IFe's Board of Directors approved the designations of $100 million for a Global Infrastructure Project&#13;
Development Fund, and the designation of $100 million for micro funds for Small and Medium Enterprise development in IDA.&#13;
As of June 30, 2008, no amounts have been expensed related to these designations.&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings approved by IFe's Board of Directors on September 27,2007 were noted with approval by&#13;
the Board of Governors on October 22, 2007.&#13;

&amp;#12;V.       ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
In executing its sustainable private sector development business, IFe assumes various kinds of risks. IFe's management has&#13;
defined a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, within which it recognizes four main risk groupings: strategic&#13;
risk, credit risk, financial risk, and operational risk.&#13;
&#13;
Active management of these risks is a key determinant of IFe's success and its ability to maintain a stable capital and earnings&#13;
base, and is an essential part of its operations. As part of its enterprise risk management framework, IFe has adopted several&#13;
key financial and exposure policies and a number of prudential policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT ARCHITECTURE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY08 enterprise risk highlights&#13;
After the stand-alone Risk Management Vice Presidency was established in FY07, the risk management function in IFe&#13;
continued to be enhanced in FY08 through rationalization and expansion of existing functions and in some cases,&#13;
establishing new capacity for additional functions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  16       IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;Plans and steps taken in this regard include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Establishing a new Market and Risk unit, which has enhanced IFC's pricing capabilities for its liquid asset&#13;
           portfolios and which will, among other things, look into the development and implementation of a Corporate Value&#13;
           at Risk measurement system for IFC.&#13;
       ·   Expanding IFC's operational risk assessment and management capabilities beyond investment operations, in&#13;
           particular the launch of a corporate integrity due diligence process to encompass all of IFC's business lines,&#13;
           further strengthening its strategic risk management.&#13;
           Streamlining and strengthening operating processes and enhancing reporting effectiveness and accountability&#13;
           through an ongoing Business Process Review.&#13;
       ·   Strengthening internal controls especially around accounting and financial reporting, advisory service activities,&#13;
           and information technology expenditures.&#13;
           Working toward enhanced and harmonized reporting of all risk metrics and uses of delegated authorities from&#13;
           the Board. As of July 1, 2008, an integrated risk reporting unit was established to coordinate and provide an&#13;
           overall risk profile of the Corporation.&#13;
       ·   Completing the design framework for a Corporate-wide compilation of all IFC's policies and procedures,&#13;
           including risk and financial management policies for IFC activities and operations. The framework will provide&#13;
           for easy dissemination across the Corporation alongside its decentralization efforts.&#13;
           Preparing a framework for, and anticipating, potential financial risks in IFC member countries or general&#13;
           portfolio deterioration.&#13;
       ·   Using an economic capital approach for capital adequacy, capital allocation and internal risk management&#13;
           purposes as well as for setting general loan loss reserves. This approach brings IFC in line with industry best&#13;
           practice in the measurement of risk&#13;
           Enhancing risk/return metrics and other corporate tools for risk-rating and active portfolio management&#13;
           including economic capital allocation, improved risk rating systems and associated principles that allow for&#13;
           greater decentralization and accountability for pricing, performance measurement and portfolio management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC has been experiencing strong growth in all its businesses and is focused on implementing its strategic objective of&#13;
becoming a client-driven organization, providing global knowledge and local expertise with decentralized dedsion making. In&#13;
parallel, IFC has stepped up its efforts to maintain asset quality, enhanced the independence of its risk management function,&#13;
and reaffirmed the enterprise-wide nature of its mandate.&#13;
&#13;
In FY08, IFC increased risk management staffing and placed key credit risk managers and other risk oversight disciplines in&#13;
the Asia regional hub in order to improve the timeliness and quality of the risk decision process. This decentralization of the&#13;
risk function is now propagated to the other regions. The comprehensiveness of the risk process at IFC necessitates reviews&#13;
of economic and social risks, corporate governance standards, and integrity risk of clients, in addition to the more traditional&#13;
credit quality and operational concerns.&#13;
&#13;
This program became operational at the beginning of FY08, and based on lessons learned, IFC is now progressing to&#13;
decentralize further in FY09, and risk management resources will be deployed to other regional hubs as needed. IFC believes&#13;
that the move to put key decision risk makers in the regions will significantly improve the quality of its enterprise risk&#13;
management coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines strategic risk as the potential reputation, finanCial, and other consequences of a failure to achieve its strategic&#13;
mission and, in particular, its sustainable development mandate.&#13;
&#13;
The overall management of strategic risk is effected through the definition and implementation of an annual strategy for&#13;
meeting IFC's mission and guidelines for its investment operations, advisory services, and treasury activities. The strategy is&#13;
developed with Senior Management by the Operational Strategy Department, and is approved by the Board of Directors. The&#13;
Independent Evaluation Group conducts ex post evaluations of the implementation of IFC's strategy on an ongoing basis.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's commitment to quality enterprise risk management, particularly on the environment and social front, continues to gain&#13;
acceptance with our strategic partners, as the "Equator Principles" announced in FY05 have now become an established&#13;
standard for financial institutions engaged in finance in the emerging markets. Responsibility for managing these economic&#13;
and social risk principles, both internally and in liaison with other financial institutions rests with the Environment and Social&#13;
Development Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO              17&#13;
&amp;#12;In addition, IFC is focused on ensuring that the evolving principles of corporate governance are accepted and practiced by our&#13;
clients, and great emphasis is placed on developing these standards as part of IFC's development activities. Responsibility for&#13;
managing corporate governance both internally and within our clients' operations rests with the Corporate Governance&#13;
Department.&#13;
&#13;
More broadly, the responsibility for the management of the integrity risk associated with the selection of clients and partners&#13;
and its review aspects rests with the operational departments. Support and knowledge sharing are provided by the Business&#13;
Risk Department.&#13;
&#13;
The key guiding principles and policies established as part of the framework for managing strategic risk are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Guiding principles for IFC's operations&#13;
  Catalytic role: IFC will seek above all to be a catalyst in facilitating productive investments in the private sector of its&#13;
  developing member countries. It does so by mobilizing financing from both foreign and domestic investors from the&#13;
  private and public sectors.&#13;
&#13;
  Business partnership: (FC functions like a business in partnership with the private sector. Thus, (FC takes the same&#13;
  commercial risks as do private institutions, investing its funds under the discipline of the marketplace.&#13;
&#13;
  Additionality: IFC participates in an investment only when it can make a special contribution not offered or brought to&#13;
  the deal by other investors.&#13;
&#13;
  Environmental and social policies&#13;
  The Corporation has developed a comprehensive set of Guidelines and Safeguard Policies to promote&#13;
  environmentally and socially responsible private sector investments. Project sponsors are given the Safeguard&#13;
  Policies for environmental and social issues to review prior to conducting their assessments, as well as the&#13;
  environmental, health, and safety guidelines specific to the particular industry, sector, and type of project.&#13;
&#13;
  When making investments, IFC applies its standards to the project and project performance is monitored against&#13;
  those standards. Projects are expected to comply with the applicable policies and guidelines, as well as applicable&#13;
  local, national, and international laws.&#13;
&#13;
  fFC sanctions procedures&#13;
  In FY07, IFC established a set of procedures to sanction parties involved in IFC projects committing corrupt,&#13;
  fraudulent, collusive, coercive or obstructive practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY08 strategic risk highlights&#13;
IFC's Environmental and Social Policies have become widely recognized as best practice when 12 international commercial&#13;
banks adopted them in the form of the Equator Principles. To date, more than 60 leading international financial institutions&#13;
have adopted these principles.&#13;
&#13;
As of January 1, 2007, (FC adopted a stricter enforcement of its approach to combating fraud and corruption related to newly&#13;
initiated investment financing, as well as advisory services. In conjunction with its sister organizations in the World Bank&#13;
Group, and as part of this new approach, IFC adopted new and expanded definitions of fraud and corruption, which were&#13;
harmonized with other multilateral development institutions. A process for sanctions and debarment of customers committing&#13;
these bad acts has been established. The enhanced emphasis on combating fraud and corruption does not change the high&#13;
expectations IFC has always held for its staff, clients and projects, including due diligence and commitment to good corporate&#13;
governance.&#13;
&#13;
Credit risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines credit risk as the potential reduction in value of on- and off-balance sheet assets due to a deteriorating credit profile&#13;
of its clients, the countries in which it invests, or a financial counterparty. Credit risk is incurred in two areas of IFC's&#13;
operations: (i) in its investment operations, where IFC provides loans, invests in debt securities and equity investments,&#13;
provides guarantees and acts as a derivatives counterparty for clients in its developing member countries, and (ii) in its&#13;
treasury and portfolio management operations, where credit risk is incurred with counterparties in IFC's liquid asset, borrowing,&#13;
asset-liability management, and portfolio management activities. As part of its mandate, IFC is prohibited from accepting host&#13;

&amp;#12;government guarantees of repayment on its investments and, therefore, incurs commercial and sovereign risk on its&#13;
investments.&#13;
&#13;
Until June 30, 2008, IFC's Risk Management and Financial Policy Department had oversight responsibility for overall financial&#13;
risk management and, in addition, monitored and controlled credit risk arising in IFC's treasury activities. Effective July 1,&#13;
2008, this responsibility was assumed by a combination of the Financial Operations and Credit Review Departments. With&#13;
respect to IFC's credit risk exposures to clients in developing countries, the Credit Review Department plays a key role. At&#13;
origination of new investments, the Credit Review Department analyzes information obtained from the investment departments&#13;
and provides an independent review of the credit risk of the transaction. After commitment, the quality of IFC's investment&#13;
portfolio is monitored according to supervision principles and procedures defined in the Operational Policies and Procedures.&#13;
Responsibility for the day-to-day monitoring and management of credit risk in the portfolio rests with the portfolio management&#13;
units of individual investment departments. Their assessments are subject to quarterly review, on a sample basis, by the Loss&#13;
Provisioning Division of the Controller's and Budgeting Department and by the Credit Review Department.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's investment portfolio is subject to a number of operational and prudential limits, including limitations on single project/client&#13;
exposure, single country exposure, and segment concentration. Similarly, credit policies and guidelines have been formulated&#13;
covering treasury operations; these are subject to annual review and approval by the Finance and Risk Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, IFC has adopted the following key financial policies and guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
  Investment operations&#13;
  1. IFC does not normally finance for its own account more than 25% of a project's cost.&#13;
  2. An equity investment in a company does not normally represent more than 35% of the company's total share capital,&#13;
     provided further that IFC is not the single largest shareholder. UntillFC resumes presentation of its financial statements in&#13;
     accordance with IFRS, IFC's equity investment in a company will not normally represent more than 20% of the company's&#13;
     total share capital.&#13;
  3. Total investment in a single obligor, net of specific reserves on loans, may not exceed 4% of IFC's net worth plus general&#13;
     reserves on loans.&#13;
  4. Equity plus quasi-equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 3% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves on&#13;
     loans.&#13;
  5. Straight equity investments in a single obligor may not exceed 1.5% of IFC's net worth plus general reserves on loans.&#13;
  Portfolio management&#13;
  1. Review trigger levels ranging from 2.5% to 10% of net worth plus general reserves on loans are set for each country's&#13;
     outstanding portfoliO, net of specific reserves on loans, based on the size of its economy and its risk rating. Higher trigger&#13;
     levels may be set by the Finance and Risk Committee. IFC's exposure to a country may not normally exceed 20% of net&#13;
     worth plus general reserves on loans.&#13;
  2.IFC lender of record exposure in a country (outstanding) may not exceed 10% of a country's total long-term external debt&#13;
     for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and 5% for all other countries. Exceptions for countries with low levels of external&#13;
     debt may be made by the Finance and Risk Committee. Lower trigger levels are set for certain countries.&#13;
  3. IFC's total exposure (outstanding net of specific reserves on loans) to a single risk sector (Le., business sectors that are&#13;
     heavily influenced by a single, identifiable, world price index) may not exceed 12% of net worth plus general reserves on&#13;
     loans. Lower review trigger levels are set for single sectors, and individually for the finance and insurance sector, based&#13;
     on IFC's net worth piUS general reserves on loans and the country exposure level.&#13;
  4. IFC's committed exposure in guarantees that are subrogated in local currency is limited to $300 million for currencies for&#13;
     which there are no adequate currency and interest rate risk hedging instruments as determined by IFe's Treasury&#13;
     Department at the time of commitment. There is a sublimit of $100 million for an individual currency under this limit.&#13;
  Treasury operations&#13;
  1. Counterparties are subject to conservative eligibility criteria, currently restricted to banks and financial institutions with a&#13;
     minimum credit rating of A (with a mark-to-market agreement) or M· (without a mark·to-market agreement) by leading&#13;
     international credit rating agencies.&#13;
  2. Exposures to individual counterparties are subject to concentration caps. For derivatives, exposure is measured in terms&#13;
     of "worst case" potential exposure based on simulations of market variables. Institution-specific limits are updated monthly&#13;
     based on changes in counterparty size or credit status.&#13;
  3. To limit exposure, IFC signs collateral agreements with counterparties that require the posting of collateral when net&#13;
     exposure exceeds certain predetermined thresholds, which decrease as a counterparty's credit rating deteriorates. IFC&#13;
     also requires that A+ and lower rated counterparties should not have more than 30% of total net-oJ-collateral exposures.&#13;
  4. Because counterparties can be downgraded during the life of a transaction, the agreements provide an option for IFC to&#13;
     terminate all swaps if the counterparty is downgraded below investment grade or if other early termination events occur&#13;
     that are standard in the market.&#13;
  5. For exchange-traded instruments, IFC limits credit risk by restricting transactions to a list of authorized exchanges,&#13;
     contracts and dealers. and bv olacina limits on the Corooration's DOsition in each contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                   IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO               19&#13;
&amp;#12;FY08 credit nsk highlights&#13;
The global credit cycle has been positive since the year ended June 30,2003 (FY03) fueled by high levels of liquidity and&#13;
economic growth, and characterized by low yields and spreads. In contrast, FY08 has been characterized by significant&#13;
volatility in credit markets. In spite of these developing uncertainties, the quality of IFC's investment portfolio, as measured by&#13;
the aggregate risk level, remained relatively stable during FY08. The quality of the loan portfolio improved marginally, while the&#13;
quality of the equity portfolio marginally deteriorated. Changes to the global economic and credit environment could impact&#13;
IFC's credit risks going forward.&#13;
&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more&#13;
than 60 days unless management anticipates that collection of interest is expected in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
The amount of non accruing loans as a percentage of the disbursed loan portfolio, a key indicator of loan portfolio performance,&#13;
decreased to 2.4% at June 30, 2008 (3.0% at June 30, 2007). The principal amount outstanding on nonaccrualloans totaled&#13;
$369 million at June 30, 2008, a decrease of $9 million (2%) from the June 30, 2007, level of $378 million.&#13;
&#13;
Total reserves against losses on loans at June 30,2008, increased to $848 million ($832 millon at June 30, 2007), mainly&#13;
driven by an increase of general loan loss reserves due to strong loan portfolio growth in FY08. This is equivalent to 5.5% of&#13;
the disbursed loan portfolio as compared with 6.5% at June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
The five-year trend of nonaccruing loans is presented below:&#13;

&#13;
IFC operates under the assumption that the guarantee portfolio is exposed to the same idiosyncratic and systematic risks as&#13;
IFC's loan portfolio and the inherent, probable losses in the guarantee portfolio need to be covered by an allowance for loss.&#13;
The allowance at June 30,2008, was $17 million ($16 million at June 30,2007), based on the year-end portfolio, and is&#13;
included in payables and other liabilities on IFC's consolidated balance sheet. The increase in allowance for the year, $1&#13;
million for FY08 ($2 million decrease for FY07), is included in the provision for (release of provision for) losses on loans and&#13;
guarantees in the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has not suffered credit losses on its exposures to derivatives counterparties in its treasury operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial risk&#13;
IFC defines financial risk in three components: (a) the potential inability to realize asset values in its portfolio sufficient to meet&#13;
obligations to disburse funds as they arise (liquidity risk); (b) the potential inability to access funding at reasonable cost (funding&#13;
risk); and (c) a deterioration in values of financial instruments or positions due to changes in market variables such as interest&#13;
and exchange rates and the volatility thereof (market risk).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
      20            IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;Key financialpolicies and guidelines&#13;
IFC operates under a number of key financial policies and guidelines as detailed below, which have been approved by its&#13;
Board of Directors:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  1.   Disbursed equity plus quasi-equity investments (net of impairment write-downs) may not exceed 100% of net&#13;
       worth.&#13;
&#13;
  2.   Minimum liquidity (liquid assets plus undrawn borrowing commitments from IBRD) must be sufficient at all times&#13;
       to cover at least 45% of IFC's estimated net cash requirements for the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
  3.   Loans are funded with liabilities having the same characteristics in terms of interest rate basis and currency and,&#13;
       for fixed rate loans, duration except for Board-approved new products involving asset-liability mismatches. IFC&#13;
       maintains a minimum level of liquidity, consisting of proceeds from external funding, that covers at least 65% of&#13;
       the sum of: (i) 100% of committed but undisbursed straight senior loans; (ii) 30% of committed guarantees; and&#13;
       (iii) 30% of committed client risk management products.&#13;
&#13;
  4.   IFC is required to maintain a minimum level oftotal resources (including paid-in capital, total loss reserves and&#13;
       retained earnings, net of designations) equal to total potential losses for all on- and off-balance sheet exposures&#13;
       estimated at levels consistent with the maintenance of a AAA rating. For FY08, IFC's capital adequacy policy&#13;
       also requires a minimum ratio of capital to risk weighted assets of 30%.&#13;
&#13;
  In addition, under IFC's Articles of Agreement, as long as IFC has outstanding borrowings from IBRD, IFC's leverage,&#13;
  as measured by the ratio of IFC's outstanding debt (borrowings plus outstanding guarantees) to IFC's net worth (using&#13;
  subscribed capital), may not exceed 4.0 to 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Liquidity risk&#13;
The primary instruments for maintaining sufficient liquidity are IFC's liquid asset portfolios:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  ·    PO, which is generally invested in short-dated deposits, money market funds, and tri-party repos, reflecting its use&#13;
       for short-term funding requirements.&#13;
       P1, which is generally invested in: (a) foreign sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed and supranational fixed income&#13;
       instruments (rated AA- or better); (b) US Treasury or agency instruments; (c) asset-backed securities rated AAA&#13;
       by at least two rating agencies and/or other AAA rated notes issued by Corporations; (d) interest rate futures and&#13;
       swaps to manage currency risk in the portfolio, as well as its duration relative to benchmark; and (e) cash&#13;
       deposits.&#13;
  ·    P2, which is generally invested in US Treasuries, other sovereign and agency issues and mortgage-backed&#13;
       securities.&#13;
  ·    P3, which comprises a global fixed income portfolio and a mortgage-backed securities portfolio (managed by&#13;
       extemal managers).&#13;
       P4, which is an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio (managed by external managers).&#13;
  ·    P6, which is invested in short-term local currency money market instruments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY08 liquidity nsk highlights&#13;
At June 30, 2008, IFC's liquidity level stood at $14.6 billion, 96% of the sum of (i) 100% of committed but undisbursed straight&#13;
senior loans; (ii) 30% of committed guarantees; and (iii) 30% of committed client risk management products ($13.3 billion, and&#13;
95% at June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Funding risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC's primary objective with respect to managing funding risk is, through the adoption of the key financial policies described&#13;
above, to maintain its triple-A or AAA/Aaa credit ratings and, thereby, maintain access to market funding as needed at the&#13;
lowest possible cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY08 funding nsk highlights&#13;
During FY08, IFC raised $6.3 billion ($2.8 billion in FY07) of funding at sub-LlBOR rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS. PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO              21&#13;
&amp;#12;Market risk&#13;
&#13;
IFe's exposure to market risk is minimized by adopting the matched-funding policy noted above and by using derivative&#13;
instruments to convert assets and liabilities into floating rate US dollar assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
Investment operations&#13;
Interest rate and currency exchange risk associated with fixed rate and/or non-US dollar lending is hedged via currency and&#13;
interest rate swaps that convert cash flows into variable rate US dollar flows.&#13;
&#13;
Exposures to market risk resulting from derivative transactions with clients, which are intended to facilitate clients' risk&#13;
management, are minimized by entering into offsetting positions with highly rated market counterparties.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolios&#13;
The PO, P1 and P3 portfolios are managed to variable rate US dollar benchmarks, on a portfolio basis. To this end, a variety of&#13;
derivative instruments are used, including short-term, over-the-counter foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest&#13;
rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. IFe also takes both long and short positions&#13;
in securities in the management of these portfolios to their respective benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The primary source of market risk in the liquid asset portfolios is the P2 and P4 portfolios, which, in contrast, are managed to a&#13;
three-year duration US dollar benchmark, with additional flexibility to deviate from the benchmark. P2 represents the portion of&#13;
IFe's capital not disbursed as equity investments, and the benchmark reflects the chosen risk profile for this uninvested capital.&#13;
P4 represents an outsourced portion of the P2 portfolio. In addition, the P1 and P3 portfolios contain a degree of market risk&#13;
(e.g., spread risk).&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities&#13;
Access to funding is maximized, and cost is minimized, by issuing debt securities in various capital markets in a variety of&#13;
currencies, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable in multiple currencies, or&#13;
borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a reference interest rate, or one&#13;
or more foreign exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
Market risk associated with fixed rate obligations and structured instruments entered into as part of IFe's funding program is&#13;
generally mitigated by using derivative instruments to convert them into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with the&#13;
matched-funding policy.&#13;
&#13;
Asset-liabIlity management&#13;
While IFe's matched-funding policy provides a significant level of protection against currency and interest rate risk, IFe can be&#13;
exposed to residual market risk in its overall asset and liability management. This residual market risk is monitored by the&#13;
Asset-Liability Management group within the Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
Residual currency risk arises from events such as changes in the level of non-US dollar loan loss reserves. This risk is&#13;
managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending currency and hedging the exposure when the net asset or&#13;
liability position exceeds $5 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
Residual interest rate risk may arise from two main sources:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Assets that are fully match-funded at inception, which can become mismatched over time due to write-downs,&#13;
       prepayments, or rescheduling; and&#13;
       Differing interest rate reset dates on assets and liabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This residual risk is managed by measuring the sensitivity of the present value of assets and liabilities in each currency to each&#13;
basis point change in interest rates, with an action trigger of $50,000 for a one basis point parallel move in the yield curve.&#13;
&#13;

  22       IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;FY08 market risk highlights&#13;
Total liquid asset returns (comprising interest. realized and unrealized gains and losses. and foreign currency transaction gains&#13;
(losses» were $473 million in FY08 ($618 million in FY07 and $444 million in FY06). of which $93 million was attributable to&#13;
the PO. P1 and P3 portfolios ($187 million in FY07 and $378 million in FY06). $345 million was attributable to the P2 and P4&#13;
portfolios ($306 million in FY07 and $66 million in FY06). and. beginning in FY08. $35 million was attributable to the P6&#13;
portfolio ($0 in FY07 and $0 in FY06). The overall market environment in FY08 and. in particular. the resulting impact on the&#13;
performance of IFC's asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities portfolios are discussed in more detail in "Results of&#13;
Operations·&#13;
&#13;
Foreign currency transaction losses on non-trading activities for FY08 included in net income were $39 million ($5 million in&#13;
FY07 and $6 million gains in FY06). Foreign currency transaction gains on investments in debt securities accounted for as&#13;
available-for-sale for FY08 included in Other Comprehensive Income were $85 million ($22 million in FY07 and $0 in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operational risk&#13;
&#13;
IFC defines operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, systems and processes. These&#13;
include both internal and external events. whether caused by a lack of controls. documentation. or contingency planning, or ~&#13;
breakdowns in information systems, communications. physical safeguards. business continuity. supervision. transaction&#13;
processing, or in the execution of legal. fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. As such. operational risk covers the risks&#13;
emanating from the manner in which an entity is operated as opposed to the way it is financed.&#13;
&#13;
Consistent with the Basel II Capital Adequacy guidelines. IFC is developing a matrix framework to analyze operational risk by&#13;
identifying. for each area (people. systems and processes), which risks IFC will: (i) manage internally. as part of its ongoing&#13;
business; (ii) alleviate through contingency planning; or (iii) transfer to third parties, whether by subcontracting. outsourcing.&#13;
hedging. or insurance.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibility for the development of the framework for managing and monitoring operational risk and contingency planning for&#13;
emergency recoveries now rests with the Operational Risk Division of the Business Risk Department. In respect of insurable&#13;
operational risk. IFC's Insurance Services Division, also part of the Business Risk Department. performs insurance reviews to&#13;
identify underlying risks and assess the adequacy of existing insurance policies and limits.&#13;
&#13;
IFC seeks to mitigate the risks it manages internally by maintaining a comprehensive system of internal controls that is&#13;
designed not only to identify the parameters of various risks but also to monitor and control those areas of particular concern.&#13;
&#13;
Key components of this effort are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Key components of operational risk management&#13;
  ·     Since FY07. IFC's Operational Risk Division has been developing assessments and measuring areas of operational&#13;
        risk in IFC, using well-defined market practices and tools.&#13;
        IFC has adopted the COSO' control framework and a control self-assessment methodology to evaluate the&#13;
        effectiveness of its internal controls in all significant business operations. In addition. the COBI'(-I methodology is&#13;
        used to supplement the COSO review of the information technology function. The program includes compliance&#13;
        testing of key internal controls. ensuring the reliability of external financial reporting and has been applied to Donor&#13;
        Funded Operations as well.&#13;
        The Internal Audit Department of the World Bank Group performs ongoing independent review of the effectiveness&#13;
        of IFC's internal controls in selected key areas and functions.&#13;
        To promote data integrity. the Corporation has formulated a Data Management Policy. This policy is enforced by&#13;
        the Information Quality Group within the Controller's Department and through a network of Departmental Data&#13;
        Stewards.&#13;
        IFC has a New Products/Initiatives Assessment Group. with representation from key business and support&#13;
        functions. to ensure that processes and controls are in place to manage the risks in new products and initiatives&#13;
        before they are executed.&#13;

  1. COSO refers to the Intemal COntrol-Integrated Framework formulated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission,&#13;
  which was convened by the US Congress in response to the well-publiclzed irregularities that occurred in the financial sector in the United States during the&#13;
  late 19805.&#13;
  2. COBIT refers to COntrol Objectives for Infomnation and Related Technology, first released in 1996. updated to the 3rdedition released in July 2000,&#13;

&amp;#12;FY08 operahonai risk highlights&#13;
IFC continues to focus on its preparedness to react to an emergency situation that could disrupt its normal operations. During&#13;
FY08, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  ·    Added applications and capabilities to back-up facilities available for its key strategic financial and support systems&#13;
       and continued extensive testing thereof.&#13;
  ·    Reinforced and extended home computing arrangements for essential staff in all departments, as part of IFC's&#13;
       contingency planning.&#13;
  ·    Conducted awareness training for Washington, DC-based departments and larger country offices, covering business&#13;
       continuity in general and pandemic preparedness in particular.&#13;
  ·    Established Emergency Management Teams in all regions; conducted emergency simulation exercises, in&#13;
       cooperation with IBRD, in its Washington, DC offices and in the regional hub offices; and held emergency&#13;
       management workshops in the larger country offices in each region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC is continuing a multiyear effort to analyze and develop enhanced methodologies for measuring, monitoring and managing&#13;
operational risk in its key activities. During FY08, IFC has:&#13;
&#13;
  ·    Developed a framework for IFC's strategic and operational risk functions within the expanded Business Risk&#13;
       Department.&#13;
  ·    Completed an operational risk review of the Advisory Services operations with recommendations for further risk&#13;
       management improvements.&#13;
  ·    Made strategic plans to formalize and expand operational risk review activities across IFC's other business lines.&#13;
  ·    Initiated the development of various operational risk tools, such as Risk and Control Self Assessments and Key Risk&#13;
       Indicators, to be piloted during FY09.&#13;
  ·    Conducted events to promote and raise awareness of operational risk management, including inviting experts from&#13;
       extemal organizations to share experiences and market practices on operational risk-related topiCS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In FY08, IFC continued its voluntary practice of conducting an annual assessment of its internal controls over external financial&#13;
reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over external finanCial reporting described in COSO. Based upon&#13;
this assessment, management believes that IFC maintained effective internal control over external financial reporting&#13;
presented in conformity with US GAAP, as of June 30, 2008. As a result of changes in applicable auditing standards,&#13;
beginning with FY06, management has not sought the attestation to its published assertion on internal controls previously&#13;
provided by IFC's external auditors. IFC has adopted a risk-based internal control initiative, in conjunction with the annual&#13;
assessment of its internal controls based on the COSO framework, which serves as the basis for IFC's annual management&#13;
assertion. Furthermore, IFe is implementing improvements to internal controls and procedures over the accounting for&#13;
derivative instruments associated with the investment portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
IFC is looking to resume the external auditors' attestation as to internal controls in conjunction with the transition from US&#13;
GAAP to IFRS. The form and timing of such an attestation will depend partly on the precise requirements which will be set in&#13;
this respect through an expected revision to the applicable US auditing standard (AT501), and on discussions with IFC's new&#13;
external auditors who have been appointed effective July 1, 2008. In the meantime, IFC is vigorously pursing both its own&#13;
enhanced risk-based internal controls initiatives and continued full compliance with the COSO framework.&#13;

&amp;#12;VI.      CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#13;
The Notes to IFC's FY08 consolidated financial statements contain a summary of IFC's significant accounting policies,&#13;
including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Certain of these policies are considered to be "critical"&#13;
to the portrayal of IFC's financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments,&#13;
some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies include: (i) determining the level of the&#13;
allowance for losses in the loan portfolio; (ii) determining the fair value of certain equity investments, debt securities, loans and&#13;
liquid assets which are accounted for at fair value on IFC's consolidated balance sheet with no quoted market prices; and (iii)&#13;
for equity investments carried at cost less impairment, determining the level of impairment of such equity investments.&#13;
Additional information about these policies can be found in Notes A, P and X to the FY08 consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans&#13;
&#13;
IFC considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that IFC will be unable to&#13;
collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. The reserve against losses for impaired loans reflects&#13;
management's judgment of the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. The&#13;
reserve against losses for loans includes an estimate of probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not speCifically&#13;
identifiable. The reserve is established through periodic charges to income in the form of a provision for losses on loans.&#13;
Loans written off, as well as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded through the reserve.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of the adequacy of reserves against losses for loans is highly dependent on management's judgment about&#13;
factors such as geographical concentration, industry, regional and macroeconomic conditions, and historical trends. Due to the&#13;
inherent limitation of any particular estimation technique, management utilizes a capital pricing and risk framework to estimate&#13;
the probable losses on loans inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable. This Board-approved framework uses&#13;
actual loan loss history and aligns the loan loss provisioning framework with IFC's capital adequacy framework.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans is separately reported in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of IFC's total&#13;
loans. Increases or decreases in the reserve level are reported in the income statement as provision for losses or release of&#13;
provision for losses on loans, and guarantees. The reserve against losses on loans relates only to the Client Services segment&#13;
of IFC (see Note R to the FY08 consolidated financial statements for further discussion of IFC's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
Equity impairment&#13;
&#13;
IFC assesses all equity investments for impairment each quarter. When impairment is identified and is deemed to be other&#13;
than temporary, the equity investment is written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis in the equity&#13;
investment. IFC has elected to assume that all impairments shall be deemed to be other than temporary. Impairment losses&#13;
are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity investment until it is sold. IFC has determined that all equity&#13;
impairments are deemed to be other than temporary.&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of financial instruments with no quoted market prices&#13;
&#13;
As part of its compliance with SFAS No. 133, SFAS No. 157, and SFAS No. 159, IFe reports atfairvalue all of its derivative&#13;
instruments, all of its liquid asset trading securities and certain borrowings, loans, equity investments and debt securities. In&#13;
addition, certain features in various investment agreements contain embedded or standalone derivatives that, for accounting&#13;
purposes, are separately accounted as either derivative assets or liabilities, including puts, caps, floors, and forwards.&#13;
Beginning in FY08, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 157, IFC classifies all financial instruments accounted for at fair value as&#13;
Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 as described in more detail in Note X to IFC's FY08 consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Many of IFC's financial instruments accounted for at fair value have a ready market valuation. The fair values of the financial&#13;
instruments with no quoted market prices are generally estimated using independent commercial pricing services, where&#13;
available, and complex pricing models of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Management makes numerous&#13;
assumptions in developing priCing models, including the appropriate discount rates, interest rates, and related volatility and&#13;
expected movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in assumptions could have a significant impact on the&#13;
amounts reported as assets and liabilities and the related unrealized gains and losses reported in the income statement. The&#13;
fair value computations affect both the Client Services and Treasury segments of IFC (see Note R to the FY08 consolidated&#13;
financial statements for further discussion of IFC's business segments).&#13;
&#13;
Additional information can be found in Notes A, P and X to the FY08 consolidated financial statements.&#13;

&amp;#12;Pension and other postretirement benefits&#13;
&#13;
IFC participates, along with IBRD and MIGA, in pension and postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of their&#13;
staff members. All costs, assets and liabilities associated with the plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA based&#13;
upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. The underlying actuarial assumptions used to determine the&#13;
projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets and funded status associated with these plans are based on financial&#13;
market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions.&#13;

&amp;#12;VII.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
The overall market environment has a significant influence on IFe's financial performance. While emerging markets and IFe&#13;
have faced very favorable conditions since FY03, the environment changed significantly in FY08, with heightened uncertainty&#13;
replacing the stability of recent years. The current environment is marked by increased risk aversion, acute liquidity strains in&#13;
international financial markets and elevated commodity and food prices. To date, the impact has been strongest in the United&#13;
States. The developed markets and emerging markets have so far weathered the deterioration relatively well, although equity&#13;
markets in some countries where IFe has significant investments have dropped sharply in recent months. The changing&#13;
environment is likely to entail implications for IFe's financial performance.&#13;
&#13;
The main elements of IFe's net income, comprehensive income and influences on the level and variability of operating and net&#13;
income from year to year, are:&#13;

&amp;#12;Restatement of FY07 consolidated financial statements&#13;
&#13;
On November 21,2007, IFe decided to restate the audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended June&#13;
30, 2007. On February 13, 2008, IFe issued its restated consolidated financial statements for the three years ended June 30,&#13;
2007.&#13;
&#13;
As disclosed in Note X to IFe's FY08 consolidated financial statements, historically, IFe had not bifurcated certain embedded&#13;
derivatives or accounted for certain derivatives associated with its loans, debt securities and equity investments. These&#13;
comprise put options, call options, income participation features, prepayments, warrants and loan conversion features. IFe has&#13;
determined that, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, certain of these should have been accounted for as derivatives, resulting in&#13;
the recording of derivative assets and liabilities, measured at fair value. This application of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a&#13;
restatement of previously reported results. This restatement, necessary to correct the historical application. resulted in an&#13;
increase in reported retained earnings at July 1, 2004 of $24 million. and the following changes in reported net income for the&#13;
periods presented in the restated consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007:&#13;
&#13;
         - a decrease in net income of $106 million for the year ended June 30. 2007;&#13;
         - a decrease in net income of $14 million for the year ended June 30, 2006; and&#13;
           a decrease in net income of $1 million for the year ended June 30. 2005.&#13;
&#13;
IFe also determined that. in accordance with SFAS No 115, certain loans in the amount of $94 million at June 30, 2007 should&#13;
have been reclassified as debt securities. IFe further determined that the carrying value of debt securities should have been&#13;
decreased by $16 million at June 30, 2007 (increased by $56 million - June 30, 2006) to reflect fair value at the respective&#13;
dates. These applications of SFAS No. 115 resulted in a restatement. necessary to correct the historical application. of&#13;
previously reported net income and other comprehensive income for the periods presented in the restated consolidated&#13;
financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007:&#13;
&#13;
         - a decrease in net income of $22 million for the year ended June 30, 2007;&#13;
         - a decrease in other comprehensive income of $50 million for the year ended June 30, 2007; and&#13;
         - an increase in other comprehensive income of $56 million for the year ended June 30. 2006.&#13;
&#13;
This Management's Discussion and AnalysiS incorporates the effects of the restatement of IFe's FY07 consolidated financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
&#13;
The following paragraphs detail significant variances between FY08 and FY07 (as restated). and FY07 (as restated) and FY06&#13;
(as restated), covering the periods included in IFe's FY08 consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note A to IFe's&#13;
FY08 consolidated financial statements. certain amounts in FY07 and FY06 have been reclassified to conform to the current&#13;
year's presentation. Where applicable, the following paragraphs reflect reclassified prior year comparative information. Such&#13;
reclassifications had no effect on operating income, net income or total assets.&#13;
&#13;
FY08 versus FY07 (as restated)&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
IFe's income before expenditures for advisory services. expenditures for PBG. grants to IDA and net unrealized gains (losses)&#13;
on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value for FY08 was $2.088 million. Expenditures for advisory&#13;
services for FY08 totaled $123 million, expenditures for PBG totaled $27 million, and grants to IDA totaled $500 million,&#13;
resulting in operating income for FY08 of $1 ,438 million.&#13;
&#13;
FY08 operating income continues to be robust. particularly with respect to income from equity investments. Realized gains on&#13;
equity investments totaled $1,396 million in FY08. IFe has recorded a charge for equity impairment write-downs of $140&#13;
million in FY08. The overall quality of the loan portfolio at the end of FY08 has marginally improved from the end of FY07. As&#13;
a result, specific loan loss reserves decreased but the general loan loss reserve increased due to very strong portfolio growth.&#13;
IFe has recorded a small provision for losses on loans and guarantees of $38 million in FY08. Income from liquid asset trading&#13;
activities has, in absolute terms, been relatively robust in FY08 at $473 million, despite the recent "credit crunch" in the United&#13;
States and its adverse impact on the value of certain asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities held in some of&#13;
IFe's liquid asset portfolios. Performance versus benchmark suffered, though, and losses on asset-backed securities and&#13;
mortgage-backed securities totaled $474 million in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  28       IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
Income from loans and guarantees&#13;
IFC's primary interest eaming asset is its loan portfolio. Income from loans and guarantees for FY08 totaled $1,065 million,&#13;
compared with $1,062 million in FY07, an increase of $3 million.&#13;
&#13;
The growth in the loan portfolio and the overall change in average interest rates during FY08, when compared with FY07,&#13;
contributed $21 million to the increase in income from loans. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual&#13;
status, net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $5 million higher in FY08, compared to&#13;
FY07. Income from IFC's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, was $22 million lower in FY08 than&#13;
in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
Commitment and financial fees were $21 million higher than in FY07, principally reflecting growth attributable to strong&#13;
commitments and disbursements. Unrealized losses on loans accounted for at fair value were $18 million lower than in FY07,&#13;
and other income from loans was $4 million lower in FY08 than in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio decreased by $604 million from $2,292 million in FY07 to $1,688 million in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
IFC generated realized gains on equity investments, including recoveries of previously written-off equity investments and net of&#13;
losses on sales of equity investments, for FY08 of $1,396 million, as compared with $1,941 million for FY07, a decrease of&#13;
$545 million. Total realized gains on equity investments in FY08 from 15 investments generated individual capital gains in&#13;
excess of $20 million and comprised 62% of the FY08 gains, compared to 13 investments that generated individual capital&#13;
gains in excess of $20 million and comprised 76% of the FY07 gains. During FY07, IFC sold its shares in Banca Comerciala&#13;
Romana SA and recorded a capital gain in the amount of $833 million. IFC continued to sell equities and take some limited&#13;
gains in investments where IFC's developmental role was complete, and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been&#13;
met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income totaled $428 million, as compared with $385 million in FY07. Consistent with FY07, a significant amount of&#13;
IFC's dividend income in FY08 was due to retums on IFC's joint ventures in the oil, gas and mining sectors accounted for&#13;
under the cost recovery method, which totaled $59 million in FY08, as compared with $64 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
Unrealized gains on equity investments in FY08 pursuant to IFC's adoption of SFAS No. 159 effective July 1, 2008, tolaled $12&#13;
million in FY08. Income from investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $19 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
Income from debt securities&#13;
Income from debt securities increased to $163 million in FY08 from $27 million in FY07, an increase of $136 million. Realized&#13;
gains on debt securities were $103 million higher than in FY07, and the impact of the growth in the debt securities portfolio and&#13;
the change in the overall interest rate environment contributed $36 million to the increase. Dividends from preferred shares&#13;
classified as debt securities were $3 million lower in FY08 when compared to FY07.&#13;
&#13;
Provision for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
As noted above. the quality of IFC's loan portfolio improved marginally during FY08. IFC recorded a provision for losses on&#13;
loans and guarantees of $38 million in FY08 ($43 million release in FY07), including $1 million in respect of guarantees ($2&#13;
million release in FY07). On June 30, 2008, IFC's total reserves against losses on loans were 5.5% of the disbursed loan&#13;
portfolio (6.5% at June 30. 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading&#13;
activities, and a small currency translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities,&#13;
increased from $13.3 billion at June 30, 2007, to $14.6 billion at June 30, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS. PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO               29&#13;
&amp;#12;Income from liquid asset trading activities totaled $473 million in FY08 ($618 million in FY07). In FY08, the P1, P2, P3 and P4&#13;
portfolios underperformed their respective benchmarks and the PO portfolio outperformed its benchmark. In FY07, the PO and P3&#13;
portfolios outperformed their respective benchmarks, while the P1, P2 and P4 portfolios underperformed their respective&#13;
benchmarks. The main cause of the underperformances when compared to benchmark in FY08 was the poor performance of the&#13;
holdings of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Weak housing data in the United States led to lower valuations of&#13;
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. Announcements of widespread credit losses and write downs fueled systemic risk&#13;
concems in the global banking system and led to widespread deleveraging and a general flight b quality. Losses on asset-&#13;
backed and mortgage-backed securities in FY08 totaled $474 million. IFC's asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities are&#13;
rated "triple-A" by at least one rating agency. United States Treasury paper rallied sharply and prices br all credit paper&#13;
regardless of the intrinsic credit quality suffered substantially. Gains on other non-asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities&#13;
were $278 million in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
The P1 portfolio generated a loss of $10 million in FY08, a retum of (0.06)%. In FY07, the P1 portfolio generated a retum of $211&#13;
million, or 4.61 %. The P3 portfolio, managed against the same variable rate target as the P1 portfolio, retumed $30 million in&#13;
FY08, or 3.13%, $29 million lower than the $59 million, or 5.82%, retum in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
The P2 and P4 portfolios retumed $332 million (5.71%) and $13 million (2.90%) in FY08, respectively, as compared to $247&#13;
million (4.54%) and $20 million (5.17%) in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's PO portfolio eamed $73 million in FY08, a total retum of 4.44%, as compared to $81 million (5.52%) in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
Income from IFC's P6 local currency liquidity portfolio totaled $35 million in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
IFC's charges on borrowings decreased by $19 million, from $801 million in FY07 to $782 million in FY08, largely reflecting the&#13;
decreased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY08 and FY07. The weighted average cost of IFC's&#13;
borrowings outstanding from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, fell during the year from 5.0% at&#13;
June 30, 2007 to 2.8% at June 30, 2008. The size of the borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before&#13;
fair value adjustments, increased by $4.0 billion in FY08 from $15.6 billion at June 30, 2007, to $19.6 billion atJune 30, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Other income&#13;
Other income of $113 million for FY08 was $14 million higher than in FY07 ($99 million).&#13;
&#13;
Other expenses&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 14% from $482 million in FY07 to $549&#13;
million in FY08, principally reflecting the significant increase in business volumes and associated Board- approved&#13;
administrative budget increases and staff complement in country offices in FY08 when compared to FY07. Administrative&#13;
expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses attributable to IFC's reimbursable program and&#13;
jeopardy projects ($33 million in FY08, as compared with $34 million in FY07). IFC recorded an expense from pension and&#13;
other postretirement benefit plans in FY08 of $3 million, as compared with $15 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services in FY08 totaled $123 million, $27 million or 28% higher than expenditures for advisory&#13;
services of $96 million in FY07. The increase reflects the continued growth in demand for such services.&#13;
&#13;
Performance-based grants&#13;
Expenditures for PBG were $27 million in FY08 ($0 in FY07).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Grants to IDA&#13;
During FY07, IFC recorded a grant to IDA of $500 million, as compared with $150 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  30       IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;Netincome&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A. and X to IFC's FY07 consolidated financial statements, IFC elected to early adopt SFAS&#13;
No. 159 and account for a limited population of financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and bsses on such&#13;
financial instruments being reported in net income, namely: (i) all swapped market borrowings; and (ii) all equity investments in&#13;
which IFC has greater than 20% holdings and/or equity and fund investments which, in the absence of SFAS No. 159, would&#13;
be required to be accounted for under the equity method. All other non-trading derivatives, including stand-alone and&#13;
embedded derivatives in the loan, equity and debt security portfolios continue to be accounted for at fair value in accordance&#13;
with SFAS No. 133. Prior to July 1, 2007, IFC had designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities as fair&#13;
value hedges. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships was recorded in net unrealized gains and losses&#13;
on non-trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 159 and SFAS No.133 on net income in FY08 and FY07 can be summarized as follows (US$&#13;
millions):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The largest component of net unrealized gains and losses on other financial instruments in FY08 was on derivatives&#13;
associated with equity investments, principally put options, stock options, and warrants. As emerging markets equities&#13;
experienced declines in FY08, IFC's put options, warrants, and conversion features entered into in part as an exit strategy&#13;
became more valuable, resulting in unrealized net gains of $110 million. Such unrealized gains are highly concentrated, with&#13;
five derivatives accounting for $103 million, or 94% of the unrealized gains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other comprehensive income&#13;
Unrealized gains and losses on equity investments and debt securities&#13;
IFC's investments in debt securities and, effective July 1, 2007, IFC's equity investments that are listed in markets that provide&#13;
readily determinable fair values at fair value are classified as available-for-sale, with unrealized gains and losses on such&#13;
investments being reported in other comprehensive income until realized. When realized, the gain or loss is transferred to net&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
On July 1, 2007, IFC reflected unrealized gains on such equity investments totaling $2,925 million as a cumulative effect of the&#13;
adoption of SFAS No. 157 on accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity&#13;
investments and debt securities being reported in other comprehensive income are significantly impacted by (i) the global&#13;
environment for emerging markets equities; and (ii) the realization of gains on sales of such equity investments and debt&#13;
securities.&#13;
&#13;
During the first half of FY08, IFC recorded net unrealized gains on equity investments of $943 million in other comprehensive&#13;
income. As the global environment for emerging markets became more challenging in the second half of FY08, IFC recorded&#13;
net unrealized losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income of $1 ,421 million, a net unrealized loss totaling&#13;
$4 78 million in FY08.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  IFC 2008 FINANCIALS. PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO             31&#13;
&amp;#12;The net change in unrealized gains on equity investments and debt securities in other comprehensive income can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs on benefit plans&#13;
As a result of adopting SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&#13;
(SFAS No. 158), IFC recognizes the funded status of each of its plans on its consolidated balance sheet. The funded status of&#13;
each plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. On June 30,&#13;
2007, IFC recorded a net asset of $648 million for the plans. Additionally, IFC recorded a credit of $246 million in accumulated&#13;
other comprehensive income. During each subsequent year, changes in the funded status of these plans will be recognized in&#13;
other comprehensive income, to the extent they are not recognized in net income under periodic benefit cost for the year.&#13;
During FY08, IFC experienced a decrease in the current value adjustment for unrecognized net periodic pension cost of $206&#13;
million in FY08, primarily reflecting the excess of expected returns over actual retums on plan assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FY07 (as restated) versus FY06 (as restated)&#13;
&#13;
Operating income&#13;
IFC's income before expenditures for advisory services, PBG, grants to IDA and net unrealized gains (losses) on non-trading&#13;
financial instruments for FY07 was $2,835 million. Expenditures for advisory services for FY07 totaled $96 million and grants&#13;
to IDA totaled $150 million, resulting in operating income for FY07 of $2,589 million.&#13;
&#13;
The record operating performance in FY07 was mainly attributable to significant equity income (principally capital gains and&#13;
dividends). In addition, there was a continued overall improvement in the quality of the loan and equity investment portfolio, as&#13;
measured by portfolio impairment and portfolio risk levels, although at a slower pace than in FY06. The aggregate risk level&#13;
within the portfolio has been reduced principally due to: (i) the successful restructuring or rescheduling of problem projects; (ii)&#13;
the growth in the outstanding portfolio in new investments with better risk ratings; (iii) the write-off of investments with worse&#13;
risk ratings than the average risk rating of the portfolio; and (iv) an overall improvement in country risk ratings. This&#13;
improvement began during the latter stages of FY03 and has continued through FY07. Additionally, IFC's liquid asset&#13;
portfolios yielded significant positive contributions to IFC's operating income, totaling $618 million in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
A more detailed analysis of the components of IFC's operating income follows.&#13;
&#13;
Income from loans and guarantees&#13;
IFC's primary interest earning asset is its loan portfolio. Income from loans and guarantees for FY07 totaled $1,062 million,&#13;
compared with $804 million in FY06, an increase of $258 million, or 32%.&#13;
&#13;
The growth in the loan portfolio and the overall increase in average interest rates during FY07, when compared with FY06,&#13;
contributed $201 million of the increase in interest income. Recoveries of interest on loans being removed from non-accrual&#13;
status, net of reversals of income on loans being placed in nonaccrual status, were $12 million lower in FY07, compared to&#13;
FY06. Income from IFC's participation notes, over and above minimum contractual interest, was $24 million higher in FY07&#13;
than in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Commitment and financial fees, after the effects of deferring and amortizing net loan origination fees, were $45 million higher&#13;
than in FY06, principally reflecting growth attributable to strong commitments and disbursements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Income from equity investments&#13;
Income from the equity investment portfolio increased by $1,078 million from $1,228 million in FY06 to a record $2,306 million&#13;
in FY07.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  32       IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO&#13;
&amp;#12;IFC generated realized capital gains on equity sales, including recoveries of previously written-off equity investments and net of&#13;
losses on sales of equity investments, for FY07 of $1,941 million, as compared with $928 million for FY06, an increase of&#13;
$1,013 million. During FY07. IFC sold its shares in Banca Comerciala Romana SA and recorded a capital gain in the amount&#13;
of $833 million. Total realized capital gains on equity sales from 13 investments generated individual capital gains in excess of&#13;
$20 million and comprised 76% of the FY07 gains (before write-offs and losses on sales), compared to 11 investments that&#13;
generated individual capital gains in excess of $20 million and comprised 42% of the FY06 gains. IFC continued to take&#13;
advantage of buoyant markets throughout most of FY07 to sell equities and take some limited gains in investments where&#13;
IFC's developmental role was complete, and where pre-determined sales trigger levels had been met.&#13;
&#13;
Dividend income was also significantly higher in FY07 at $385 million, as compared with $323 million in FY06. Consistent with&#13;
FY06, a significant amount of IFC's dividend income in FY07 was due to returns on IFC's joint ventures in the oil, gas and&#13;
mining sectors accounted for under the cost recovery method, which totaled $64 million in FY07, as compared with $86 million&#13;
in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Income from LLPs, certain LLCs, and other investments accounted for under the equity method totaled $19 million in FY07&#13;
($56 million in FY06).&#13;
&#13;
Income from debt securities&#13;
Income from debt securities increased to $27 million in FY07 from $7 million in FY06, an increase of $20 million. Realized&#13;
gains on debt securities were $1 million higher than in FY06, and the impact of the growth in the debt securities portfolio and&#13;
the change in the overall interest rate environment contributed $10 million to the increase. Dividends from preferred shares&#13;
classified as debt securities were $9 million higher in FY07 when compared to FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Release of provision for losses on loans and guarantees&#13;
As noted above, the quality of IFC's loan portfolio continued to improve during FY07 although at a slower pace than in FY06&#13;
and FY05. IFC recorded a release of provision for losses on loans and guarantees of $43 million in FY07 ($15 million provision&#13;
in FY06), including $2 million in respect of guarantees ($5 million provision in FY06). On June 30, 2007, IFC's total reserves&#13;
against losses on loans were 6.5% of the disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio excluding unamortized deferred net loan&#13;
origination fees and the unamortized SFAS No. 133 transition adjustment (8.3% at June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities&#13;
Income from liquid asset trading activities comprises interest from time deposits and securities, net gains and losses on trading&#13;
activities, and a small currency translation effect. The liquid assets portfolio, net of derivatives and securities lending activities,&#13;
increased from $12.7 billion at June 30,2006, to $13.3 billion at June 30, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset income totaled $618 million in FY07 ($444 million in FY06). In a year when US interest rates were relatively stable,&#13;
although higher on average than in FY06, IFC has been able to increase the level of absolute income from its liquid asset&#13;
portfolios. In FY07, the PO and P3 portfolios outperformed their respective benchmarks, while the P1, P2, and P4 portfolios&#13;
underperformed their respective benchmarks. In FY06, all of IFC's liquid asset portfolios oUl&gt;erformed their respective&#13;
benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
The P1 portfolio generated income of $211 million in FY07, a return of4.61%. In FY06, the P1 portfolio generated a return of&#13;
$288 million, or 5.20%. The P3 portfolio, managed against the same variable rate target as the P1 portfOlio, returned $59 million&#13;
in FY07, or 5.82%, $16 million higher than the $43 million, or4.31%, return in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
The P2 and P4 portfolios returned $247 million (4.54%) and $20 million (5.17%) in FY07, respectively, as compared to $64 mllion&#13;
(1.38%) and $2 million (0.35%) in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
IFC's PO portfolio earned $81 million in FY07, a total return of 5.52%, as compared to $47 million (4.48%) in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
Charges on borrowings&#13;
IFC's charges on borrowings increased by $198 million, from $603 million in FY06 to $801 million in FY07, largely reflecting the&#13;
increased US dollar interest rate environment, when comparing FY07 and FY06. Charges on borrowings in FY07 included $8&#13;
million in respect of interest expense on secured borrowings ($6 million in FY06). The weighted average cost of IFC's&#13;
borrowings outstanding from market sources, after the effects of borrowing-related derivatives, rose during the year from 4.9%&#13;
at June 30, 2006 to 5.0% at June 30, 2007. The size of the borrowings portfolio, net of borrowing-related derivatives and before&#13;
the effects of SFAS No. 133, increased by $0.3 billion in FY07 from $15.3 billion at June 30, 2006, to $15.6 billion at June 30,&#13;
2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO               33&#13;
&amp;#12;Other income&#13;
Other income of $99 million for FY07 was $10 million lower than in FY06 ($109 million).&#13;
&#13;
Other expenses&#13;
Administrative expenses (the principal component of other expenses) increased by 11 % from $436 million in FY06 to $482&#13;
million in FY07, principally reflecting the significant increase in business volumes and staff complement in country offices in&#13;
FY07 when compared to FY06. Administrative expenses include the grossing-up effect of certain revenues and expenses&#13;
attributable to IFe's reimbursable program and jeopardy projects ($34 million in FY07, as compared with $37 million in FY06).&#13;
IFe recorded expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans in FY07 of $15 million, as compared with $28&#13;
million in FY06.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services&#13;
Expenditures for advisory services in FY07 totaled $96 million, $41 million or 75% higher than expenditures for advisory&#13;
services of $55 million in FY06. The increase reflects the continued growth in demand for such services.&#13;
&#13;
Grants to IDA&#13;
During FY07, IFe transferred $150 million to IDA, recording an expense of $150 million.&#13;
&#13;
Net income&#13;
As more fully disclosed in Notes A, 0 and P to IFe's FY07 consolidated financial statements, prior to July 1,2007, IFe had&#13;
designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges. IFe generally matrnes the terms of its&#13;
derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying borrowing hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates,&#13;
interest rates, and other features. However, differing valuation methodologies are applied to the derivative and the hedged&#13;
financial instrument. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships was recorded in net gains (losses) on non-&#13;
trading financial instruments, in net income.&#13;
&#13;
The effects of SFAS No. 133 on net income in FY07 and FY06 can be summarized as follows (US$ millions):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Net gains (losses) on non-trading financial instruments largely comprises the difference between the change in fair value of&#13;
derivative instruments and the change in fair value of the hedged item under designated hedging relationships and the fair&#13;
value of derivative instruments for which hedge accounting has not been elected in relation to borrowings and lending&#13;
activities.&#13;

&#13;
Board of Directors&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with its Articles of Agreement, members of IFC's Board are appointed or elected by their member governments.&#13;
These Directors are neither officers nor staff of IFC. The President is the only management member of the Board, serving as a&#13;
non-voting member and as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established several Committees including:&#13;
&#13;
    Committee on Development Effectiveness&#13;
    Audit Committee&#13;
    Budget Committee&#13;
    Personnel Committee&#13;
·   Ethics Committee&#13;
·   Committee on Governance and Administrative Matters&#13;
&#13;
The Board and its Committees function in continuous session at the principal offices of the World Bank Group, as business&#13;
requires. Each Committee's terms of reference establish its respective roles and responsibilities. As Committees do not vote&#13;
on issues, their role is primarily to serve the full Board in discharging its responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Committee&#13;
&#13;
Membership&#13;
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board. Membership on the Committee is determined by the Board,&#13;
based upon nominations by the Chairman of the Board, following informal consultation with the Directors. In addition,&#13;
membership of the Committee is expected to reflect the economic and geographic diversity of IFC's member countries. Other&#13;
relevant selection criteria include seniority, continuity, and relevant experience. Some or all ofthe responsibilities of individual&#13;
Committee members are performed by their alternates or advisors. Generally, Committee members are appointed for a two-&#13;
year term; reappointment to a second term, when possible, is desirable for continuity. Audit Committee meetings are generally&#13;
open to any members of the Board who may wish to attend, and non-Committee members of the Board may partiCipate in the&#13;
discussion. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee may speak in that capacity at meetings of the Board with respect&#13;
to discussions held in the Audit Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Key fl7sponsibilities&#13;
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board to assist it in the oversight and assessment of IFC's finances and accounting,&#13;
including the effectiveness of financial policies, the integrity of financial statements, the system of internal controls regarding&#13;
finance, accounting and ethics (including fraud and corruption), and financial and operational risks. The Audit Committee also&#13;
has the responsibility for reviewing the performance and recommending to the Board the appointment of the external auditor,&#13;
as well as monitoring the independence of the external auditor and meeting with the external auditor in executive session. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                   IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO              35&#13;
&amp;#12;Audit Committee participates in oversight of the intemal audit function, including reviewing the responsibilities, staffing and the&#13;
effectiveness of internal audit. The Committee also reviews the annual internal audit plan and meets with the Auditor General&#13;
in executive session. In the execution of its role, the Committee discusses with management, the external auditors, and the&#13;
internal auditors financial issues and policies which have a bearing on IFC's financial position and risk-bearing capacity. The&#13;
Audit Committee monitors the evolution of developments in corporate governance and the role of audit committees on an&#13;
ongoing basis and revised its terms of reference in FY04.&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
The Audit Committee communicates regularly with the Board through distribution of the following:&#13;
&#13;
    The minutes of its meetings.&#13;
    Reports of the Audit Committee prepared by the Chairman, which document discussions held. These reports are&#13;
    distributed to the Directors, Alternates, World Bank Group Senior Management and Vice Presidents of IFC.&#13;
    "Statement(s) of the Chairman" and statements issued by other members of the Committee.&#13;
    The Annual Report to the Board, which provides an overview of the main issues addressed by the Audit Committee over&#13;
    the year.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committee's communications with the external auditor are described in the Auditor Independence section, below.&#13;
&#13;
Executive sessions&#13;
Members of the Audit Committee may convene in executive session at any time, without management present. Under the&#13;
Committee's terms of reference, it meets separately in executive session with the external and internal auditors.&#13;
&#13;
Access to outside resources and to management&#13;
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee receives a large volume of information, which supports the preparation of the&#13;
financial statements. The Audit Committee meets both formally and informally throughout the year to discuss financial and&#13;
accounting matters. Directors have complete access to the management of IFC. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses&#13;
with management the quarterly and annual financial statements. The Committee also reviews with the external auditor the&#13;
financial statements prior to their publication and recommends them for approval to the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
The Audit Committee has the capacity, under exceptional circumstances, to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal,&#13;
accounting or other advisors as deemed appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Code of Ethics&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group strives to foster and maintain a positive work environment that supports the ethical behavior of its staff.&#13;
To facilitate this effort, the World Bank Group has a Code of Professional Ethics in place. The Code (Code of Professional&#13;
Ethics - Living our Values) applies to all staff (including managers, consultants, and temporary employees) worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
The Code is available in nine languages on the World Bank Group's Web site, www.worldbank.org. Staff relations, conflicts of&#13;
interest, and operational issues, including the accuracy of books and records, are key elements of the Code.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the Code, an essential element of appropriate conduct is compliance with the obligations embodied in the Principles&#13;
of Staff Employment, Staff Rules, and Administrative Rules, the violation of which may result in disciplinary action. In accordance&#13;
with the Staff Rules, senior managers must complete a confidential financial disclosure instrument with the Office of Ethics and&#13;
Business Conduct.&#13;

&amp;#12;Guidance for staff is also provided through programs, training materials, and other resources. Managers are responsible for&#13;
ensuring that internal systems, policies, and procedures are consistently aligned with the World Bank Group's ethical goals. In&#13;
support of its efforts on ethics, IBRD offers a variety of methods for informing staff of these resources. Many of these efforts are&#13;
headed by the following groups:&#13;
&#13;
    The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct provides leadership, management and oversight for the World Bank Group's&#13;
    ethics infrastructure including the Ethics Help Line, a consolidated conflicts of interest disclosure! resolution system,&#13;
    financial disclosure, ongoing training to both internal and external audiences, and communication resources.&#13;
    The Department of Institutional Integrity is charged with investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within the World&#13;
    Bank Group. The Department also investigates allegations of misconduct by World Bank Group staff, and trains and&#13;
    educates staff and clients in detecting and reporting fraud and corruption in World Bank Group-funded projects. The&#13;
    Department reports directly to the President and is composed of professionals from a range of disciplines including&#13;
    financial analysts, researchers, investigators, lawyers, prosecutors, forensic accountants, and World Bank Group staff with&#13;
    operational experience.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group has in place procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received regarding&#13;
accounting, internal controls and auditing matters.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group offers both the Ethics Help Line and a Fraud and Corruption hotline run by an outside firm staffed by&#13;
trained specialists. This third-party service offers numerous methods of communication in addition to a toll-free hotline in&#13;
countries where access to telecommunications may be limited. In addition, there are other methods by which the Department&#13;
of Institutional Integrity may receive allegations, including directly by email, anonymously, or through confidential submission&#13;
through its Web site, as well as the postal service and telephone.&#13;
&#13;
Auditor independence&#13;
&#13;
In FY03, the Board adopted a set of principles applicable to the appointment of the external auditor for IFC. Key features of&#13;
those principles include:&#13;
&#13;
    Prohibition of the external auditor from the provision of all non audit-related services;&#13;
    All audit-related services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit&#13;
    Committee;&#13;
    Mandatory rebidding of the external audit contract every five years;&#13;
    Prohibition of any firm serving as external auditor for more than two consecutive five-year terms;&#13;
    Mandatory rotation of the senior partner after five years; and&#13;
    An evaluation of the performance of the external auditor at the mid-point of the five-year term.&#13;
&#13;
External auditors are appointed to a five-year term of service. This is subject to annual reappointment based on the&#13;
recommendation of the Audit Committee and approval of a resolution by the Board. Following a mandatory rebidding of the&#13;
external audit contract during FY08, IFC's Board approved the appointment of KPMG as IFC's auditors for a five-year term&#13;
commencing FY09.&#13;
&#13;
As a standard practice, the external auditor is present as an observer at virtually all Audit Committee meetings and is&#13;
frequently asked to present its perspective on issues. In addition, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the external&#13;
auditor in private session without management present. Communication between the external auditor and the Audit Committee&#13;
is ongoing, as frequently as is deemed necessary by either party. IFC's external auditors follow the communication&#13;
requirements with audit committees set out under U.S. generally accepted auditing standards. In keeping with these standards,&#13;
significant formal communications include:&#13;
&#13;
    Quarterly and annual financial statement reporting;&#13;
    Annual appointment of the external auditors;&#13;
    Presentation of the external audit plan;&#13;
    Presentation of control recommendations and discussion of the COSO report; and&#13;
    Presentation of a statement regarding independence.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to Committee meetings, individual members of the Audit Committee have independent access to the external&#13;
auditor.&#13;

Management's Report Regarding Effectiveness of&#13;
Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting&#13;
&#13;
The management of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is responsible for the&#13;
preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of its published financial statements and all other&#13;
infonnation presented in the accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis. The&#13;
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally&#13;
accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and, as such, include amounts based on&#13;
informed judgments and estimates made by management.&#13;
&#13;
The financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting fi~ which was given&#13;
unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of&#13;
the Board of Executive Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes that all&#13;
representations made to the independent auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate.&#13;
The independent auditors' report accompanies the audited financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with US GAAP. The&#13;
system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct&#13;
deficiencies identified. Management believes that internal controls for external financial&#13;
reporting, which are subject to scrutiny by management and the internal auditors, and are revised&#13;
as considered necessary. support the integrity and reliability of the external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Key procedures that Management has established, which are designed to provide effective&#13;
internal financial control within IFC, include the preparation, review and Board approval of&#13;
annual financial plans that align with strategic plans prepared every year. Results are monitored&#13;
regularly and reports on progress compared to the plan are prepared quarterly. Additionally,&#13;
systems are in place to monitor financial risks such as changes in the market prices of financial&#13;
instruments, funding of assets, operational error and fraud. Exposure to these risks is monitored&#13;
by the IFC Finance and Risk Committee, I Further, the system of internal controls includes&#13;
written policies and procedures, proper delegation of authority, accountability through&#13;
establishing responsibility centers, and segregation of duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I The members of Finance and Risk Committee are: the EVP and CEO (Chair), VP Risk Management, VP Business&#13;
Advisory Services, VP Asia, Latin America and Global Manufilcturing. VP Middle East, North Africa and&#13;
Infrastructure, VP Sub·Saharan Africa and Western Europe, VP Europe. Central Asia and Global Financial Markets,&#13;
VP Financial and Private Sector Development, and IFe Chief Economist, VP and General Counsel and VP Finance&#13;
and Treasurer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the&#13;
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even&#13;
effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial&#13;
statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal&#13;
control may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
IFC assessed its internal control over external financial reporting for financial presentations in&#13;
conformity with US GAAP as of Iune 30, 2008. This assessment was based on the criteria for&#13;
effective internal control over external financial reporting described in Internal Control-&#13;
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway&#13;
Commission. Based upon this assessment~ management believes that IFC maintained effective&#13;
internal control over external financial reporting presented in conformity with US GAAP, as of&#13;
Iune 30, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Executive Directors of IFC has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for&#13;
monitoring the accounting practices and internal controls of !Fe. The Audit Committee is&#13;
comprised entirely of Executive Directors who are independent of IFC's management. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Executive Directors the&#13;
selection of independent auditors. It meets periodically with management, the independent&#13;
auditors, and the internal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their responsibilities. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring&#13;
the financial, accounting and auditing procedures ofIFC in addition to reviewing IFC's reports.&#13;
The independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit&#13;
Committee, with or without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be&#13;
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.&#13;

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
President and Board of Governors&#13;
International Finance Corporation&#13;
&#13;
We have au4ited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the International Finance Corporation&#13;
as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, including the consolidated statement of capital stock and voting power as&#13;
of June 30. 2008 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income. changes in&#13;
capital, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2008. These&#13;
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the International Finance Corporation's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based&#13;
on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about&#13;
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes&#13;
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are&#13;
appropriate in the circumstances. but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of&#13;
the International Finance Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly. we express&#13;
no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and&#13;
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and&#13;
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial $tatement&#13;
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion. such consolidated financial statements present fairly. in all material respects, the financial&#13;
position of the International Finance Corporation as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its&#13;
operations and its cash flows for cach of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2008 in&#13;
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.&#13;
&#13;
As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements. during the year ended June 30. 2007, the&#13;
International Finance Corporation adopted SFAS No. 158. «Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit&#13;
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans."&#13;
&#13;
As discussed in Note X to the consolidated financial statements. effective July i , 2007. IFCadopted&#13;
SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" and SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial&#13;
Assets and Financial Liabilities" including an amendment of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain&#13;
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."&#13;
&#13;
As discussed in Note Y to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated financial statements for&#13;
the year ended June 30, 2007 have been restated.&#13;

PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic development in its&#13;
member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. IFC is a rnember of the World Bank Group, which also includes the&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), and the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). IFC's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development objectives of the&#13;
other World Bank Group institutions. IFC, together with private investors, assists in financing the establishment, improvement and expansion of&#13;
private sector enterprises by making loans and equity investments where sufficient private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable&#13;
terms. IFC's share capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds for its investment activities through the issuance of&#13;
notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital markets. IFC also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding&#13;
from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan participations, underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project&#13;
finance and resource mobilization, IFC offers an array of finanCial and technical advisory services to private businesses in the developing world&#13;
to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private&#13;
enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;

&#13;
Consolidated financial statements presentation - Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's&#13;
presentation.&#13;
&#13;
Use of estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that&#13;
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial&#13;
statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A&#13;
significant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the adequacy of the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of&#13;
equity investments; estimated fair values of financial instruments accounted for at fair value (including equity investments, debt securities, loans,&#13;
trading securities and derivative instruments) and net periodic pension income or expense. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to&#13;
IFC's operations. The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
IFC uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments accounted for at fair value and the aggregate&#13;
level of the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity inVestments. IFC undertakes continuous review and respeclfication of&#13;
these models with the objective of refining its estimates, consistent with evolving best practices appropriate to its operations. Changes in&#13;
estimates resulting from refinements in the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period&#13;
in which the enhanced models are first applied. See Note X for more information on IFC's use of fair value measurements.&#13;
&#13;
Fair Value Option and Fair Value Measurements IFC adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial&#13;
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 159, The Fair Value Option of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No, 159 or the Fair Value&#13;
Option) as of July 1, 2007 and elected to apply the Fair Value Option to the following financial assets and financial liabilities existing at the time&#13;
of adoption and entered into during the year ended June 30, 2008:&#13;
(I) direct equity investments in which IFC has significant inlluence and loans to such investees;&#13;
(i1) direct equity investments representing 20 percent or more ownership but in which IFC does not have significant influence and certain&#13;
      investments in Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) and Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) that maintain specific ownership accounts&#13;
      and loans or guarantees to such investees; and&#13;
(iii) all market borrowings, except for such borrowings having no associated derivative instruments.&#13;
&#13;
The reasons for electing the Fair Value Option for these financial assets and financial liabilities and more information about the adoption of&#13;
SFAS No. 159 are discussed in more detail in Note X.&#13;
&#13;
IFC also adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) effective July 1,2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes&#13;
a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.&#13;
Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 157, IFC now reports equity investments that are listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair&#13;
values at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other comprehensive income, Further disclosures of fair value&#13;
measurements are provided in Note X.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies     Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars (US dollars or $), other than disbursed equity&#13;
investments, are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. Disbursed equity investments,&#13;
other than those accounted for at fair value, are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income&#13;
and expenses are recorded based on the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Transaction gains and losses are credited&#13;
or charged to income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans - IFC originates loans to facilitate project finance, restructuring, refinancing, corporate finance, and/or other developmental objectives.&#13;
Loans are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding adjusted for net unamortized&#13;
loan origination costs and fees. It is IFC's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees.&#13;

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Effective July 1, 2007, certain loans are carried at fair value in accordance with the Fair Value Option as noted above and as discussed in more&#13;
detail in Note X. Unrealized gains and losses on loans accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option are reported in income from&#13;
loans and guarantees on the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC enters into loans with income participation, prepayment and conversion features; these features are accounted for in accordance with&#13;
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended to the&#13;
extent they meet the definition of a derivative and are not considered to be clearly and closely related to their host loan contracts.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on loans - Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. Net loan&#13;
origination costs and fees are amortized over the estimated life of the originated loan to which the fees relate. Prepayment fees are recorded as&#13;
income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days&#13;
unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status&#13;
is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously recognized&#13;
but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the consolidated balance sheet in payables and other&#13;
liabilities, and credited to income only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the&#13;
reserve against losses on loans in the consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve against losses on loans - IFC recognizes impairment on loans not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet through the&#13;
reserve against losses on loans, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans in net income, which increases or decreases&#13;
the reserve against losses on loans. Individually impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows to be&#13;
received, observable market prices, or for loans that are dependent on collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral.&#13;
&#13;
Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans, taking into account established guidelines and its&#13;
assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines include intemal country and loan risk ratings, and the impairment potential of the&#13;
loan portfolio based on IFC's historical portfolio loss experience on mature loans.&#13;
&#13;
The reserve against losses on loans reflects estimates of both probable losses already identified and probable iosses inherent in the portfolio but&#13;
not specifically identifiable. The determination of identified probable losses represents management's judgment of the creditworthiness of the&#13;
borrower. Reserves against losses are established through a review of individual loans undertaken on a quarterly basis. IFC considers a loan&#13;
as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that IFC will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the&#13;
loan's contractual terms. Unidentified probable losses are the expected losses over a three-year risk horizon, in excess of identified probable&#13;
losses. The risks inherent in the portfolio that are considered in determining unidentified probable losses are those proven to exist by past&#13;
experience and include: country systemic risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks;&#13;
nonperformance under guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in, financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Loans are written-off when IFC has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve against losses on loans. Such reductions&#13;
in the reserve are offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off loans.&#13;
&#13;
Equity Investments - IFC invests primarily for developmental impact; IFC does not seek to take operational, controlling, or strategic eqUity&#13;
positions within its investees. Equity investments are acquired through direct ownership of eqUity instruments of investees, as a limited partner in&#13;
LLPs and LLCs, and/or as an investor in a private equity fund.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue recognition on equity investments - Effective July 1, 2007, equity investments which are listed in markets that provide readily&#13;
determinable fair values are accounted for as available-for-sale securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other&#13;
comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. As noted above&#13;
under "Fair Value Option and Fair Value Measurements", also effective July 1, 2007, direct equity investments in which IFC has significant&#13;
influence, direct eqUity investments representing 20 percent or more ownership but in which IFC does not have significant influence and certain&#13;
investments in LLPs and LLCs that maintain specific ownership accounts are accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option. Direct&#13;
eqUity investments in which IFC does not have significant influence (and prior to July 1, 2007 certain investments representing more than 20%&#13;
ownership) and which are not listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair values are carried at cost less impairment.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to July 1, 2007, IFC's investments in companies where it had significant influence and certain investments in LLPs and LLCs that maintain&#13;
specific ownership accounts were accounted for under the equity method.&#13;
&#13;
IFC'S investments in certain private equity funds in which IFC is deemed to be the Primary Beneficiary of a VIE, as the presumption 01 control by&#13;
the fund manager or the general partner has been overcome, are fully consolidated into IFC's books. Certain equity investments, for which&#13;
recovery Of invested capital is uncertain, are accounted for under the cost recovery method, such that receipts ollreely convertible currencies&#13;
are first applied to recovery of invested capital and then to income from eqUity investments. The cost recovery method is principally applied to&#13;
IFC's investments in its oil and gas unincorporated joint ventures (UJVs). IFC's share of conditional asset retirement obligations related to&#13;
investments in UJVs are recorded when the fair value of the obligations can be reasonably estimated. The obligations are capitalized and&#13;
systematically amortized over the estimated economic useful lives.&#13;
&#13;
Unrealized gains and losses on eqUity investments accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option are reported in income from equity&#13;
investments on the consolidated income statement. Unrealized gains and losses on equity investments listed in markets that provide readily&#13;
determinable fair values are reported in other comprehensive income.&#13;

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Dividends and profit participations received on equity investments are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible&#13;
currencies. Realized gains on the sale or redemption of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and&#13;
are generally recorded as income in income from equity investments when received in freely convertible currencies. Capital losses are&#13;
recognized when incurred.&#13;
&#13;
IFC enters into put and call option and warrant agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in accordance with&#13;
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of equity investments - Equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment are assessed for impairment each quarter.&#13;
When impairment is identified and is deemed to be other than temporary, the equity investment is written down to the impaired value, which&#13;
becomes the new cost basis in the equity investment. Impairment losses are not reversed for subsequent recoveries in value of the equity&#13;
investment until it is sold.&#13;
&#13;
Debt securities - Debt securities in the investment portfolio are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value on the consolidated&#13;
balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains on sales&#13;
of debt securities and interest on debt securities is included in income from debt securities on the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC invests in certain debt securities with conversion features; these features are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting&#13;
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees - IFC extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and trade&#13;
obligations. IFC offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the&#13;
terms of IFC's guarantees, IFC agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client (Le.,&#13;
failure to pay when payment is due). Guarantees are regarded as issued when IFC commits to the guarantee. Guarantees are regarded as&#13;
outstanding when the underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and this date is considered to be the "inception" of the guarantee.&#13;
Guarantees are regarded as called when IFC's obligation under the guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the&#13;
guarantees: (1) the stand-ready obligation to perform and (2) the contingent liability. The fair value of the stand-ready obligation to perform is&#13;
recognized at the inception of the guarantee unless a contingent liability exists at that time or is expected to exist in the near term. The&#13;
contingent liability associated with the financial guarantee is recognized when it is probable the guarantee will be called and when the amount of&#13;
guarantee called can be reasonably estimated. All liabilities associated with guarantees are included in payables and other liabilities, and the&#13;
receivables are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. When the guarantees are called, the amount disbursed is recorded&#13;
as a new loan, and specific reserves against losses are established, based on the estimated probable loss. Guarantee fees are recorded in&#13;
income as the stand-ready obligation to perform is fulfilled. Commitment fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings - IFC establishes funding mechanisms for specific Board approved purposes through designations of&#13;
retained earnings. Total designations of retained earnings are determined based on IFC's annual income before expenditures against&#13;
deSignated retained earnings and net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in excess of $150&#13;
million, and contemplating the financial capacity and strategic priorities of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures resulting from such designations are recorded as expenses in IFe's consolidated income statement in the year in which they&#13;
occur, also having the effect of reducing the respective designated retained earnings for such purposes. Expenditures are deemed to have&#13;
occurred when IFC has ceded control of the funds to the recipient. If the recipient organization is deemed to be controlled by IFC, the&#13;
expenditure is deemed to have occurred only when the recipient organization expends the funds to a non-related party. On occasion, recipient&#13;
organizations which are deemed to be controlled by IFC will acquire certain investment assets other than cash. These investments have had&#13;
no material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In such cases, IFC includes those assets on its&#13;
consolidated balance sheet, where they remain until the recipient organization disposes of or transfers the asset or IFC is deemed to no longer&#13;
be in control of the recipient organization. Investments resulting from such designations are recorded on IFC's consolidated balance sheet in&#13;
the year in which they occur, also having effect of reducing the respective deSignated retained earnings for such purposes.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio - IFC's liquid funds are invested in government, agency and government-sponsored agency obligations, time deposits&#13;
and asset-backed, including mortgage-backed. securities. Government and agency obligations include long and short positions in highly rated&#13;
fixed rate bonds, notes, bills, and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities&#13;
including government agencies and instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by IFC, consists of:&#13;
time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase&#13;
agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of securities and payables for purchases of securities; and related&#13;
accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
Securities and related derivative instruments within IFC's liquid asset portfOlio are classified as trading and are carried at fair value with any&#13;
changes in fair value reported in income from liquid asset trading activities. Interest on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of&#13;
discounts are also reported in income from liquid asset trading activities.&#13;
&#13;
IFC classifies cash and due from banks and time deposits (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as cash and cash equivalents in the&#13;
conSOlidated statement of cash flows because they are generally readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days of acquisition.&#13;

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements - Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees&#13;
to repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases&#13;
securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
It Is IFC's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government securities, The&#13;
market value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained when their value&#13;
declines, IFC also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the&#13;
agreements, requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases,&#13;
&#13;
Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the&#13;
securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - To diversify its access to funding and reduce its borrowing costs, IFC borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of&#13;
borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, IFC simultaneously&#13;
converts such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions, Under certain&#13;
outstanding borrowing agreements, IFC is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money&#13;
security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
Effective July 1, 2007, substantially all borrowings are carried at fair vale under the Fair Value Option with changes in fair value reported in net&#13;
unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value on the conSOlidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to July 1, 2007, where borrowings were part of a deSignated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount&#13;
was adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged, Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks&#13;
were reported in net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading finanCial instruments accounted for at fair value in the consolidated&#13;
Income statement. All other borrowings were recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premiums and unaccreted&#13;
discounts,&#13;
&#13;
Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings,&#13;
&#13;
Risk management and use of derivative instruments - IFC enters into transactions in various derivative instruments for financial risk&#13;
management purposes in connection with its prinCipal business activities, Including lending, investing In debt securities and equity Investments,&#13;
client risk management, borrowing, liquid asset portfolio management and asset and liability management.&#13;
&#13;
All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they&#13;
are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, debt securities and equity&#13;
investments are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities, The value at inception of such&#13;
embedded derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the consolidated balance sheet Changes in fair values of&#13;
derivative instruments used in the liquid asset portfolio are recorded in income from liquid asset trading activities, Changes in fair values of&#13;
derivative instruments other than those in the liquid asset portfolio are recorded in net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial&#13;
instruments accounted for at fair value,&#13;
&#13;
Prior to July 1, 2007, IFC designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges, For a derivative instrument&#13;
qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument were reported in net unrealized gains and losses on other&#13;
non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value, together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that were&#13;
attributable to the risk being hedged, IFC generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying borrowing&#13;
hedged, in terms of currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to&#13;
the derivative and the hedged financial instrument differed, The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships was recorded in net&#13;
gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in the consolidated income statement. Fair value gains&#13;
and losses on derivative instruments not in the liquid asset portfolio and not qualifying as a hedge were reported in the net unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value,&#13;
&#13;
IFC has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges and subsequent to June 30, 2007, IFC has not designated any hedging&#13;
relationships as fair value hedges.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of IFC's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are described below,&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities IFC's policy is to closely match the currency, rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative instruments are&#13;
used to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans Into variable rate US dollars. IFC has elected not to designate&#13;
any hedging relationships for all lending-related derivatives.&#13;

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities IFC enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency, interest rate, or&#13;
commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of IFC's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that arise from these transactions&#13;
with clients, IFC enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value&#13;
of all derivatives associated with these activities are reported in net income in net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial&#13;
instruments accounted for at fair value. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded in other income in the consolidated&#13;
income statement on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities IFC issues debt securities in various capital marikets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying&#13;
funding sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings&#13;
payable in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market&#13;
index, a reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. IFC uses derivative instruments with matching&#13;
terms, primarily currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with IFC's&#13;
matched funding policy. Prior to July 1, 2007 IFC designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges&#13;
of the underlying borrowings. There were a small number of fair value-like and cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge&#13;
relationships were designated. Effective July 1, 2007, IFC elected to carry at fair value, under the Fair Value Option, all market borrowings for&#13;
which a derivative instrument is used to create a fair value-like or cash flow-like hedge relationship. Changes in the fair value of such&#13;
borrowings and the associated derivatives are reported in net unrealized gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted&#13;
for at fair value in the consolidated income statement. Subsequent to June 30, 2007, these items are no longer deSignated as hedges.&#13;
&#13;
Uquid asset portfolio management activities IFC manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain of the time&#13;
deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfOlio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those instruments into&#13;
variable rate US dollars, consistent with IFC's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter&#13;
foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the&#13;
entire liquid asset portfolio is classified as a trading portfOlio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value with changes in fair&#13;
value reported in income from liquid assets. No derivatives in the liquid asset portfolio have been designated as hedges.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, IFC faces residual market&#13;
risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending&#13;
currency and reducing the net excess asset or liability position through sales or purchases. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to&#13;
writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value&#13;
of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
IFC monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients and&#13;
counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the&#13;
credit rating and size of the individual counterparty. In addition, IFC has entered into master agreements governing derivative transactions that&#13;
contain close-out and netting provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if IFC's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a&#13;
mark-to-market basis, exceeds a specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid&#13;
government securities.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations        IFe mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating loan&#13;
participations, without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by IFe on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed&#13;
and outstanding balances of loan participations that meet the applicable accounting criteria are accounted for as sales and are not included in&#13;
IFC's consolidated balance sheet. All other loan participations are accounted for as secured borrowings and are included in loans on IFC's&#13;
consolidated balance sheet, with the related secured borrowings included in payables and other liabilities on IFC's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits - IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP)&#13;
and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of IFe and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated&#13;
between IBRD, IFe, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for&#13;
their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to IFC is included in income or expense from pension&#13;
and other postretirement benefit plans in the consolidated income statement. IFe includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other&#13;
assets, representing prepaid penSion and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;
&#13;
Variable Interest Entities - In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an&#13;
interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December 2003, FASB replaced FIN 46 with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of&#13;
Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R define certain VIEs and require parties to such&#13;
                           «&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
entities to assess and measure variable interests in the VIEs for the purposes of determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Variable&#13;
interests can arise from financial instruments, service contracts, guarantees, leases or other arrangements with a VIE. An entity that will&#13;
absorb a majority of a VIE's expected losses or expected residual returns is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and must include&#13;
the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
IFC has a number of investments in VIEs which it manages and supervises in a manner consistent with other portfoliO investments. Note W&#13;
provides further details regarding IFC's variable interests in VIEs.&#13;

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments - During the year ended June 30, 2006, IFC changed its accounting principle with respect&#13;
to the amortization of loan origination fees and loan origination costs. Prior to the year ended June 30, 2006, the net of loan origination fees and&#13;
costs was considered to be insignificant. Beginning in year ended June 30, 2006, IFC began amortizing loan origination fees and costs on an&#13;
effective yield basis.&#13;
&#13;
During the year ended June 30,2006, the FASB Issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments - an amendment of FASB&#13;
Statements Nos. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155) and SFAS No. 156, Accounting for SeNicing of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB&#13;
Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). Both SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156 are effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006,&#13;
which would be the year ended June 30, 2008 for IFC. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 and SFAS No. 156 did not have a material impact on&#13;
the financial position, results of operations or cash flow of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&#13;
(SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires employers to recognize on their balance sheet the funded status of their defined benefit&#13;
postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations, and to recognize as part of&#13;
Other Comprehensive Income the gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period to the extent they are not&#13;
recognized as components of the net periodic benefit cost. Additionally, upon adoption, SFAS No. 158 requires the unrecognized net actuarial&#13;
gain or loss and the unrecognized prior service cost to be recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and that these amounts&#13;
be adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost, based upon the current amortization and&#13;
recognition requirements of SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for&#13;
Postretirement Benefits (SFAS No. 106). SFAS No. 158 was adopted in IFC's consolidated financial statements as of June 30,2007. The&#13;
impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 is described in more detail in Note S.&#13;
&#13;
In November 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue No. 06-9, Reporting a&#13;
Change in (or the Elimination of) a Previously Existing Difference Between the Fiscal Year-End of a Parent Company and That of a&#13;
Consolidated Entity or Between the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee (EITF 06-9). EITF 06-9 was&#13;
effective for IFC beginning on January 31, 2007. The adoption of EITF No. 06-9 did not have a material impact on the financial position, results&#13;
of operations or cash flow of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
In June 2007, the American institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) issued Statement of Position No. 07·1 (SOP No 07·1),&#13;
Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method&#13;
Investors for Investments in Investment Companies. SOP No. 07·1 provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of&#13;
the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the Guide). Investment Companies that are within the scope of the Guide&#13;
report investments at fair value. Effective December 15, 2007, FASB deferred indefinitely the effective date of SOP No. 07·1. I FC continues to&#13;
evaluate the provisions of SOP No. 07·1.&#13;
&#13;
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R». SFAS No. 141(R) replaces&#13;
SFAS No. 141, Business Combination, but retains its fundamental requirement that the acquisition method of accounting (formerly referred to&#13;
as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for the acquirer to be identified for each business combination. Among&#13;
other things, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in&#13;
the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values, with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires acquisition related costs&#13;
to be recognized separately from the acquisition. Acquirers in a step acquisition must recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well&#13;
as the full amount of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair value under SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No.&#13;
141(R) is effective prospectively to business combinations/acquisitions on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning&#13;
on or after December 15, 2008 (which would be the year ending June 30,2010 for IFC) and is not expected to have a material impact on IFC's&#13;
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB&#13;
No. 151 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 clarifies that non-controlling interests in a consolidated entity should be reported as eqUity in the&#13;
consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts attributable to both the parent and the non·&#13;
controlling interest and disclosure on the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of income attributable to the parent and to the non-&#13;
controlling interest. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that all changes in a parent's ownership interest that do not result in loss of control are eqUity&#13;
transactions and requires that a parent recognize gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years&#13;
beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (which would be the year ending June 30, 2010 for IFC) and is not expected to have a material&#13;
impact on IFC's financial pOSition, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No.&#13;
161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities to enable a better understanding of their effects on the reporting&#13;
entity's financial pOSition, financial performance, and cash flows. It is effective for the first set of financial statements for a reporting period,&#13;
annual or interim, that begins after November 15, 2008, which would be the quarter ending March 31, 2009 for IFC.&#13;
&#13;
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162&#13;
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements&#13;
of nongovemmental entities that are presented in accordance with US GAAP. SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the U.S.&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The&#13;
Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity Wdh Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Adoption of SFAS No. 162 is not expected to have a&#13;
material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows when it becomes effective.&#13;

NOTE L - CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS&#13;
&#13;
IFe's authorized share capital was increased to $2,450 million through two capital increases in 1992. The subscription and payment period for&#13;
shares then allocated ended on August 1, 1999, but IFe has agreed to defer the payment date for certain member countries beyond this date.&#13;
Pursuant to these arrangements, less than $1 million of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2008 ($1 million - June 30,2007).&#13;
&#13;
During the year ended June 30, 2008, 532 shares were subscribed and paid by member countries at a par value of $1,000 each (100 - year&#13;
ended June 30, 2007; 0 - year ended June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Under IFe's Articles of Agreement, in the event a member withdraws from IFe, IFe and the member may negotiate on the repurchase of the&#13;
member's capital stock on such terms as may be appropriate under the circumstances. Such agreement may provide, among other things, for&#13;
a final settlement of all obligations of the member to IFe. If such an agreement is not made within six months after the member withdraws or&#13;
such other time as IFe and the member may agree, the repurchase price of the member's capital stock shall be the value thereof shown by&#13;
the books of IFe on the day when the member withdraws. The repurchase of capital stock is subject to certain conditions including payments&#13;
in installments, at such times and in such available currency or currencies as IFe reasonably determines, taking into account the financial&#13;
position of IFe. IFe's Articles of Agreement also provide for the withdrawing member to repay losses on loans and equity investments in&#13;
excess of reserves provided on the date of withdrawal.&#13;

NOTE P - DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Many of IFe's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of future cash&#13;
flows are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor&#13;
changes in assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference&#13;
between the carryin9 amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since IFC generally holds loans,&#13;
borrowings and other financial instruments with contractual maturities with the aim of realizing their recorded values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. In different interest rate environments,&#13;
the fair value of IFe's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial instruments.&#13;
Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques&#13;
and numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a&#13;
greater degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of&#13;
financial instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of IFe. The fair&#13;
values of the individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of IFe taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2007, are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The primary pricing source for the liquid assets is valuations obtained from independent commercial pricing services. The&#13;
most liquid securities in the liquid asset portfolio are exchange traded futures and options and US treasuries. For exchange traded futures and&#13;
options, exchange quoted prices are obtained and these are classified as Level 1 in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Liquid assets valued&#13;
using quoted market prices are also classified as Level 1. US Treasuries are valued using index prices and also classified Level 1. The&#13;
remaining liquid assets valued using vendor prices are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on whether the vendor's pricing&#13;
methodologies have already been evaluated by IFe. Where vendor prices are not available, liquid assets are valued using model prices; liquid&#13;
assets valued using model prices are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the degree that model inputs are observable in the market&#13;
place.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other&#13;
derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
                                                                                IFC 2008 FINANCIALS, PROJECTS AND PORTFOLIO                      65&#13;

                     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Loans and loan commitments - IFC generally has not sold its loans from the portfolio, and there is no comparable secondary market. Fair&#13;
      values for fixed rate loans and loan commitments were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on a discount rate comprising the&#13;
      fixed rate loan spread plus the year-end estimated cost of funds. Since rates on variable rate loans and loan commitments are generally reset&#13;
      on a quarterly or semiannual basis, the carrying value adjusted for credit risk was determined to be the best estimate of fair value. IFC also&#13;
      holds options to convert loans into equity of certain of its investee companies. Fair values of these conversion options are based on quoted&#13;
      market prices or other calculated values of the underlying equity investment.&#13;
&#13;
      Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments were determined using market prices where available. Equity investments without&#13;
      available market prices were valued using valuation techniques appropriate to the investment such as recent transactions, discounted cash&#13;
      flows, relative valuation through the use of comparables, net asset values or book values. Where market prices were not available or appropriate&#13;
      valuation techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value.&#13;
&#13;
      Borrowings - Fair values were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
       Estimated fair values of IFC's financial assets and liabilities and oil-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized below (US$ millions).&#13;
       IFC's credit exposure is represented by the estimated fair values of its financial assets.&#13;

NOTE Q - CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
IFC conducts its operations for loans, debt securities, equity investments, time deposits, trading securities, and borrowings in multiple&#13;
currencies. IFC's policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments&#13;
and quasi-equity investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. IFC's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing&#13;
member countries are typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of pOlicy, IFC carries the currency risk of equity&#13;
investments and quasi-equity investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings.&#13;

NOTE R - SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
For management purposes, IFC's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment consists&#13;
primarily of lending, investing in debt and equity securities, and advisory services activities. Operationally, the treasury services segment&#13;
consists of the borrowing, liquid asset management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities. ConSistent with&#13;
internal reporting, net income (expense) from asset and liability management and client risk management activities in support of client services&#13;
are allocated to the client services segment.&#13;
&#13;
The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
employed. IFC's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each segment.&#13;
Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and segment&#13;
head counts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
The accounting policies of IFC's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in Note A, "Summary of Significant&#13;
Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;
&#13;
An analysis of IFC's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2008, June 30,2007, and&#13;
June 30, 2006, is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE S - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
IBRD, IFC and MIGA participate in a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-&#13;
Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits&#13;
to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
&#13;
The United States Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modemization Act of 2003 (the Act) established a prescription drug benefit&#13;
under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to qualifying sponsors of retiree health care benefit. The effects of the subsidy and&#13;
the related disclosures have been reflected in the financial statements.&#13;

IFC uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The amounts presented below reflect IFC's&#13;
respective share of the costs, assets and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
All costs, assets and liabilities aSSOCiated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA based upon their employees'&#13;
respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.&#13;
IDA, IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD. Contributions to these&#13;
plans are calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP. and PEBP allocated to IFC for the years ended June 30,&#13;
2008, June 30, 2007, and June 30 2006 (US$ millions):&#13;

The expenses for the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP are included in expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For the years ended&#13;
June 30, 2008, June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006, expenses for these plans of $3 million, $16 million and $28 million, respectively, were&#13;
allocated to IFC.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with the SRP, RSBP,&#13;
and PEBP for IFC for the years ended June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2007 (US$ millions). Since the assets for the PEBP are not held in an&#13;
irrevocable trust separate from the assets of IBRD, they do not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting and are therefore included in IBRD's&#13;
investment portfoliO. IFC has recognized a receivable (prepaid asset) from IBRD and a payable (liability) to IBRD equal to the amount required&#13;
to support the plan. The assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed income instruments.&#13;

Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit&#13;
changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
The expected long-term rate of return for the SAP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the&#13;
various asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach&#13;
and are not strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings&#13;
growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk&#13;
premium/spread (as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-&#13;
term rate of return for the RSSP is computed using procedures similar to those used for the SAP. The discount rate used in determining the&#13;
benefit obligation is selected by reference to the year-end AM and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses&#13;
will be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the&#13;
market-related value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service&#13;
lives of the employee group.&#13;
&#13;
The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic&#13;
pension costs for the years ended June 30, 2008, June 30, 2007, and June 30, 2006:&#13;

&#13;
Investment strategy&#13;
&#13;
The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's needs and&#13;
goals, using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that&#13;
incorporates expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the&#13;
respective plans. This analysis, referred to as an asset-liability analysis, also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future&#13;
asset and liability balances. In October 2007, a new strategic asset allocation was approved by the Pension Finance Committee. This resulted&#13;
in a change to the allocation of fixed income, public equity and alternatives. In addition, three new alternative asset classes were introduced:&#13;
timber, infrastructure, and commodities. The new investment policy is reflected in the table below. Plan assets are managed by external&#13;
investment managers and monitored by IBRO's pension investment department. The pension plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios&#13;
of public equity, fixed income, and alternative investments.&#13;
The following table presents the asset allocation at June 30,2008, and June 30,2007, and the respective target allocation by asset category for&#13;

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Expected contributions&#13;
&#13;
IFC's contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee, which bases its judgment&#13;
on the results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of contributions&#13;
expected to be paid to the SRP and RSBP for IFC during the year beginning July 1, 200B, is $16 million and $B million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE T - SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
IFC obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by IBRD.&#13;
This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal auditing,&#13;
administrative support, supplies, and insurance. IFC makes payments for these services to IBRD based on negotiated fees, chargebacks and&#13;
allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to IFC for the year ended June 30, 200B, were $34 million ($2B million&#13;
- year ended June 30, 2007; $23 million - year ended June 30, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE U - MANAGEMENT OF TRUST FUNDS&#13;
&#13;
IFC administers funds received from and on behalf of donors and/or partners (Trust Funds) that are restricted for specific uses in accordance&#13;
with applicable administration agreements and/or fiscal agency agreements. Specified uses could include, for example, Advisory Services&#13;
work including feasibility studies, project preparation, implementation of global and regional programs, and research and training programs.&#13;
IFC may also make contributions to these specific uses of funds in accordance with terms approved by IFC's Board. The IFC contributions can&#13;
be commingled with donor funds under administration in accordance with administration agreements with donors or fiscal agency agreements,&#13;
where applicable. The IFC contributions and donor funds are placed in trust and are held in a separate investment portfolio, managed by&#13;
IBRD, which is not commingled with IFC's liquid assets. IFC funding is included in the consolidated balance sheet of IFC until such time as&#13;
IFC cedes control of the funds to the recipient.&#13;
&#13;
Execution may be carried out through: a recipient-executed trust fund, an IFC-executed trust fund or a financial intermediary fund.&#13;
&#13;
IFC-executed Trust Funds involve IFC execution of activities as described in relevant administration agreements or IFC Board documents,&#13;
which define the terms and conditions for use of the funds. Spending authority is exercised by IFC, subject to any restrictions contained in the&#13;
administration agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Recipient-executed Trust Funds involve activities carried out by a recipient third-party "executing agency." IFC enters into agreements with&#13;
and disburses funds to these recipients, who then exercise spending authority to meet the objectives and comply with terms stipulated in the&#13;
agreements.&#13;
&#13;
IFC also enters into financial intermediary fund arrangements under which IFC's services are limited to the role of fiscal agent pursuant to a&#13;
fiscal agency agreement. Funds are held and disbursed in accordance with the fiscal agency agreement. Trust Fund assets at June 30, 200B,&#13;
and June 30, 2007, including $176 million (both June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007) of funds provided by IFe in its capacity as a donor, are&#13;
summarized below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE V - CONTINGENCIES&#13;
&#13;
In the normal course of its business, IFC is from time to time named as a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions on different grounds&#13;
in various jurisdictions. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, IFC's Management does not believe&#13;
the outcome of any of the various existing legal actions will have a material adverse effect on IFC's financial position, results of operations or&#13;
cash flows.&#13;

NOTE W - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND OTHER CONSOUDATED INVESTMENTS&#13;
&#13;
An entity is subject to FIN 4SR and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it lacks: (1) equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance&#13;
its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (2) equity investors who have decision-making rights about&#13;
the entity's operations or who do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity proportionally to their voting&#13;
rights.&#13;
&#13;
A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party involved with the VIE that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or&#13;
receives a majority of the expected residual returns or both. The primary beneficiary is required to initially measure the assets, liabilities and&#13;
noncontrolling interests of the VIE at their carrying amounts at the date on which it first became the primary beneficiary. Because certain VIEs&#13;
were created prior to the issuance of FIN 4SR, it may not be practicable to determine the carrying amounts of the assets, liabilities and&#13;
noncontrolling interests at the initial date, and in such cases, the primary beneficiary must measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling&#13;
interests at their fair values on the date FIN 4SR is first applied. The primary beneficiary is also required to disclose information about the&#13;
nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE, and collateral and recourse creditors may have against the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise may hold significant variable interests in VIEs which are not consolidated because the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary.&#13;
In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose information about its involvement with and exposure to the VIE, and about the nature,&#13;
purpose, size, and activities of the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise is not required to apply FIN 4SR to certain entities if, after making an exhaustive effort, it is unable to obtain the information&#13;
necessary to: (1) determine whether the entity is a VIE; (2) determine if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the possible VIE; or (3)&#13;
perform the accounting required to consolidate a possible VIE. In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose the number of entities to&#13;
which FIN 4SR is not being applied, why the information required to apply FIN 4SR is not available, the nature, purpose and activities of the&#13;
entities to which FIN 4SR is not being applied, and the enterprise's maximum exposure to the entities to which FIN 4SR is not being applied.&#13;
&#13;
Primary benefiCiary&#13;
&#13;
IFe has identified five VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary at June 30,2008 (six entities - June 30,2007). Two of the&#13;
VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have been consolidated into IFe's consolidated financial statements as of June 30,&#13;
2008 (three entities · June 30, 2007). All consolidated VIEs are in the Collective investment vehicles sector in the Latin America and&#13;
Caribbean region.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the consolidation of the two investments described above, IFC's consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2008 includes additional&#13;
assets of $20 million in equity investments ($12 million· June 30, 2007), $1 million in receivables and other assets ($3 million· June 30,&#13;
2007), and additional liabilities of $4 million in payables and other liabilities ($4 million· June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Other income for the year ended June 30, 2008 includes $7 million of income from consolidated entities ($7 million - year ended June 30,&#13;
2007; $17 million - year ended June 30, 2006) and other expense includes $1 million of expenses from consolidated entities ($2 million - year&#13;
ended June 30,2007; $10 million - year ended June 30, 200S).&#13;
&#13;
The remaining three VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have not been consolidated into IFe's consolidated financial&#13;
statements, as they are significantly impaired and information required to apply the provisions of FIN 4SR is not available. Based on the most&#13;
recent financial data available, total net assets of the three entities is $6 million. IFC's net investment in these three entities totals $2 million,&#13;
virtually all in the primary metals sector in the Asia region.&#13;
&#13;
Significant variable interests&#13;
&#13;
IFC has identified 49 investments in VIEs in which IFC is not the primary beneficiary but in which it is deemed to hold significant variable&#13;
interests at June 30, 2008 (27 · June 30, 2007). Based on the most recent available data from these VIEs, the size including committed&#13;
funding of the VIEs in which IFC is deemed to hold significant variable interests totaled $5,136 million at June 30, 2008 ($1,639 million· June&#13;
30,2007). IFC's total investment in and maximum exposure to loss to these investments in VIEs in which IFC is deemed to hold significant&#13;
variable interests, comprising both disbursed amounts and amounts committed but not yet disbursed, was $1,201 million at June 30, 2008&#13;
($367 million· June 30, 2007).&#13;

NOTE X - THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Effective July, 1, 2007, IFC adopted the SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for&#13;
measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad&#13;
levels and applies to all items measured at fair value, including items for which impairment measures are based on fair value. SFAS No. 159&#13;
permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument&#13;
basis. that are not otherwise permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the Fair Value&#13;
Option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Additionally, SFAS NO.&#13;
159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption. SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No.159 are to be applied prospectively. The&#13;
cumulative effect of remeasuring items for which the Fair Value Option has been elected effective July 1, 2007 has been reported as an&#13;
adjustment to the July 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
The Fair Value Option&#13;
&#13;
Effective July 1, 2007, IFC elected the Fair Value Option for certain borrowings, investments in equity instruments that would otherwise require&#13;
equity method accounting, investments in eqUity investments with more than 20% ownership where IFC does not have significant influence&#13;
and all other financial interests (loans and guarantees) in the entities in which IFC has an equity investment that would otherwise require&#13;
equity method accounting.&#13;
&#13;
All borrowings for which the Fair Value Option has been elected are associated with existing derivative instruments used to create a fair value-&#13;
like or cash flow-like hedge relationship, a substantial amount of which were deSignated as accounting hedges in accordance with SFAS No.&#13;
133. Measuring at fair value those borrowings for which the Fair Value Option has been elected at fair value will mitigate the earnings volatility&#13;
caused by measuring the borrowings and related derivative differently (in the absence of a deSignated accounting hedge) without having to&#13;
apply SFAS No. 133's complex hedge accounting requirements. The Fair Value Option was not elected for all borrowings from IBRD and all&#13;
other market borrowings because earnings volatility is not a concern in those cases.&#13;
&#13;
Measuring at fair value those equity investments that would otherwise require equity method accounting simplifies the accounting and renders&#13;
a carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet based on a measure (fair value) that IFC considers superior to equity method&#13;
accounting. For the investments that otherwise would require equity method accounting for which the Fair Value Option is elected, SFAS No.&#13;
159 requires the Fair Value Option to also be applied to all eligible financial interests in the same entity. IFC has disbursed loans to certain of&#13;
such investees, therefore, the Fair Value Option was also applied to those loans effective July 1, 2007. IFC elected the Fair Value Option for&#13;
equity investments with 20% or more ownership where it does not have significant influence so that the same measurement method (fair&#13;
value) will be applied to all equity investments with more than 20% ownership.&#13;

Fair Value Measurements&#13;
&#13;
SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability (Le., an exit price) in an orderly&#13;
transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date assuming the transaction occurs in&#13;
the entity's principal (or most advantageous) market. Fair value must be based on assumptions market participants would use (inputs) in&#13;
determining the price and measured assuming the highest and best use for the asset by market participants. The highest and best use of the&#13;
IFC assets and liabilities measured at fair value is considered to be in exchange, therefore, their fair values are determined based on a&#13;
transaction to sell or transfer the asset or liability on a standalone basis. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not adjusted for&#13;
transaction costs.&#13;
&#13;
The fair value hierarchy established by SFAS No, 157 gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical&#13;
unrestricted assets and liabilities (Level 1), the next highest priority to observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are&#13;
corroborated by market data from independent sources (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by&#13;
market data (Level 3), Fair value measurements are required to maximize the use of available observable inputs.&#13;
&#13;
Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices. It includes IFC's equity&#13;
investments which are listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair values, government issues, money market funds and borrowings&#13;
that are listed on exchanges.&#13;
&#13;
Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models and other valuation methodologies. These models consider various&#13;
assumptions and inputs, including time value, yield curves, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity and current&#13;
market and contractual pricing for the underlying asset, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are&#13;
observable in the market place, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which market transactions are&#13;
executed. Financial instruments categorized as Level 2 include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency&#13;
swaps, certain asset-back securities, as well as the portion of IFC's borrowings not included in Level 1.&#13;
&#13;
Level 3 consists of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing&#13;
significant inputs that are generally less observable. It also includes financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on price&#13;
information from independent sources that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Included in Level 3 are the majority of equity&#13;
investments for which IFC has elected the Fair Value Option.&#13;

their fair value of $70 million pursuant to FSP SFAS No. 115-1 and 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its&#13;
Application to Certain Investments, resulting in a loss of $35 million, which was included in income from equity investments in the consolidated&#13;
income statement during the year ended June 30, 2008. The amount of the write down is based on a Level 3 measure of fair value.&#13;

&#13;
NOTE Y - RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR PERIOD CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Historically, IFC had not bifurcated certain embedded derivatives or accounted for certain derivatives associated with its loans, debt securities&#13;
and equity investments. These comprise put options, call options, income participation features, prepayments, warrants and loan conversion&#13;
features. IFC has determined that, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, certain of these should have been accounted for as derivatives,&#13;
resulting in the recording of derivative assets and liabilities, measured at fair value. This application of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a&#13;
restatement of previously reported results. This restatement, necessary to correct the historical application, resulted in an increase in reported&#13;
retained earnings at July 1, 2004 of $24 million, and the following changes in reported net income for the periods presented in the restated&#13;
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2007:&#13;
&#13;
          - a decrease in net income of $106 million for the year ended June 30,2007;&#13;
          - a decrease in net income of $14 million for the year ended June 30, 2006; and&#13;
          - a decrease in net income of $1 million for the year ended June 30, 2005.&#13;

IFC also determined that, in accordance with SFAS No 115, certain loans in the amount of $94 million at June 30, 2007 should have been&#13;
reclassified as debt securities. IFC further determined that the carrying value of debt securities should have been decreased by $16 million at&#13;
June 30, 2007 (increased by $56 million - June 30, 2006) to reflect fair value at the respective dates. These applications of SFAS No. 115&#13;
resulted in a restatement, necessary to correct the historical application, of previously reported net income and other comprehensive income&#13;
for the periods presented in the restated consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30,2007:&#13;
&#13;
          - a decrease in net income of $22 million for the year ended June 30,2007;&#13;
          - a decrease in other comprehensive income of $50 million for the year ended June 30, 2007; and&#13;

NOTES AND DEFINITIONS&#13;
The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY08 began on July 1,2007, and ended on June 30,2008.&#13;
&#13;
Investment amounts are given in U.s. dollars unless otherwise specified.&#13;
&#13;
On-lending is the process of lending funds from IFe's own sources through intermediaries, such as local banks and&#13;
microfinance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of projects, but because IFC is the lender of record,&#13;
participants receive the same tax and country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status as a multilateral&#13;
financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features, which are designed to provide varying degrees&#13;
of risk/return trade-ofts that lie between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of individual figures in some tables.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank includes both IBRD and IDA. The World Bank Group includes IBRD, IDA, IFe. MIGA, and ICSID.&#13;

            annual report 2008 : creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Finance Corporation
            (IFC) annual report continues an approach pioneered last
            year, combining information on the investments and advisory
            services, sustainability, development effectiveness, and
            donor partnerships. The report covers fiscal 2008 (July 1,
            2007, through June 30, 2008) and discusses the year's
            new business as well as the performance and development
            results of the portfolio. In FY08, new investments totaled
            $16.2 billion, rising 34 percent from the previous year. The
            IFC seeks to enhance the accountability and to articulate
            the vision, core corporate values, purpose, and the way the
            IFC works for a wide range of stakeholders: client
            companies, governments, partners, local communities affected
            by the activities, advocacy organizations, investors, and
            the staff.
