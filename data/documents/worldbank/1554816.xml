Abstract&#13;
The study focuses on a number of key issues pertaining to Egypt's&#13;
public finances. After describing briefly the composition of the Egyptian&#13;
Government's official budget document, the study moves on to discuss the&#13;
recent budgetary trends; the structure of taxes with special emphasis on tax&#13;
performance; the composition and trend of public expenditure; the implications&#13;
of the government budget for income distribution and resource allocation; the&#13;
financial contribution of public sector enterprises, and finally, the&#13;
financing of the budget deficit. The paper makes specific recommendations&#13;
relating to each key aspect discussed, i. e. tax effort, public expenditure,&#13;
fiscal role of public enterprises and deficit financing.&#13;

Introduction and Summary&#13;
Egypt's public finances are unusual in several respects compared to&#13;
those of other countries at similar income levels. The public sectors&#13;
dominance in its economy requires the mobilization and expenditure of a vast&#13;
amount of resources. Total public expenditures are 60% of GDP, total revenues&#13;
are 40% of GDP and public sector deficit is 20% of GDP. There are very few,&#13;
if any, developing countries in the world with such high proportions. These&#13;
heighten the normal fiscal issues of the efficiency, equity and development&#13;
impact of public sector economic operations.&#13;
The 1952 Egyptian revolution marked the emergence of a dominant state&#13;
sector in the economy. Total public sector expenditure increased rapidly from&#13;
about 20% of GDP in 1952/53 to 60% in 1982/83. Two other striking features&#13;
underlying recent fiscal developments in Egypt are: the high levels of&#13;
overall budget deficit and instability in the budget. The level of deficit&#13;
has centered around 20% of GDP, fluctuating widely from 17% in 1977 to 27% in&#13;
1979. The high level of deficit and the instability are both results of a&#13;
basic structural weakmess of the budget. Budgetary revenues are quite&#13;
susceptible to 'exogenous' influences while expenditures have moved closely in&#13;
line with domestic inflationary pressures. The exogenous influences are&#13;
transmitted through the growing dependence of the budget on petroleum and Suez&#13;
Canal revenues. For example, the ratio of exogenous revenue to total revenue&#13;
increased from 11% in 1976 to 35% in 1980/81 and then fell to 25% in 1982/83.&#13;
Although foreign resources and various forms of domestic savings have&#13;
financed a considerable portion of the budget deficit, between 30% and 50% has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- x -&#13;
been financed by borrowing from the banking sector. Increasing reliance on&#13;
bank financing has caused an expansion in the supply of money in the economy&#13;
at a rate faster than the rate of expansion of the demand for money. The&#13;
imbalance has generated significant inflationary pressures in the economy&#13;
causing problems for resource allocation as well as income distribution.&#13;
Since the end of 1981 world petroleum prices have been falling&#13;
consistently and the indications are that, while prices could recover somewhat&#13;
in the medium-term, they are unlikely to show large real increases. Given&#13;
this dim prospect for continued reliance on oil revenues, the need is greater&#13;
now than ever for Egypt to restructure the government budget. The challenge&#13;
for policy makers lies in reducing the reliance on unstable sources of revenue&#13;
and monitoring expenditure increase in line with resource availability, but&#13;
without adversely affecting economic growth.&#13;
The level of taxation in relation to the tax capacity and the method&#13;
of taxation are two important fiscal issues. These are examined in Chapter&#13;
3. The analysis shows that in terms of 'tax effort' Egypt's tax performance&#13;
compares favorably with other developing countries. Also, total tax revenue&#13;
has a buoyancy value exceeding unity with respect to GDP. Although the level&#13;
of taxation in Egypt is not a major concern, there are problems regarding&#13;
equity and incentive aspects of taxation. These include: relatively strong&#13;
reliance on indirect taxes, insignificant role of personal income and property&#13;
taxes, large dependence on schedular taxes with tax rates varying according to&#13;
the source of income, significant tax exemptions which are subject to abuse&#13;
and low tax compliance. A number of possibilities exist to improve the tax&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi -&#13;
system in Egypt. The important measures are as follows:&#13;
(a) The process of moving towards a unified global income tax should&#13;
continue and should be further strengthened.-/ In order to ensure&#13;
"horizontal equity" (equal treatment at similar levels of income),&#13;
the tax base should include all sources of income. Also, the present&#13;
effort to increase compliance should continue.&#13;
(b) Tax exemptions should be based on a careful evaluation of relative&#13;
costs and benefits of such exemptions. Tax breaks should be granted&#13;
only for limited duration and should be carefully monitored to ensure&#13;
tbat they are being utilized for the stated objective.&#13;
(c) A broad based sales tax at ad valorem rates and with minimum rate&#13;
differentials should be introduced. With the growth of domestic&#13;
production, the scope of the sales tax should be increased and the&#13;
reliance on import tariffs and excise taxes should be reduced.&#13;
(d) Evaluation of custom duty liability should be based on the use of an&#13;
exchange rate which reflects the cost of procuring foreign exchange&#13;
in the market rather than the artificial and obsolete official&#13;
exchange rate.&#13;
The three main characteristics underlying the recent trends in public&#13;
sector expenditures are: the large role of 'autonomous' expenditure; the high&#13;
level of budgetary expenditure on subsidies; and the slowdown in the growth of&#13;
public sector investment. The increase in budgetary subsidies is a reflection&#13;
of the government's policy of protecting the living standards of the poorer&#13;
people in the face of a growing concentration of incomes and rapid inflation.&#13;
The rapid growth in public investment expenditures in the seventies indicates&#13;
1/ Global income tax is defined in the Egyptian context. See page 20.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

both the response of the government to ease up the physical infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks which had gained prominence with the surge in the level of&#13;
economic activity, and the attempt to reorganize the industrial base into a&#13;
more modern and capital intensive structure. The slowdown in public&#13;
investment since 1979 is partly due to physical absorptive capacity&#13;
constraints and partly due to a slowdown in the resource availability. The&#13;
analysis of public expenditure in Chapter 4 indicates that there is&#13;
significant scope both for reducing expenditure and increasing its value.&#13;
Public investments have played a major development role, but there is&#13;
significant inefficiency in the use of resources, particularly in the&#13;
industrial sector. Subsidies have provided an important safety net for low&#13;
income groups and helped avoid major social crises, but much can be done to&#13;
lower subsidy expenses and target benefits to the really needy. The growth in&#13;
autonomous expenditure can also be slowed down substantially by revising&#13;
government service employment practices and reducing transfer payments to the&#13;
public sector. Some important expenditure management measures are:&#13;
(a) Better targetting of subsidies on essential goods to really needy&#13;
consumers through a more effective rationing system;&#13;
(b) Frequent adjustments in the selling prices of subsidized goods to&#13;
reflect cost increases;&#13;
(c) Eliminating completely subsidies on non-essential goods such as meat,&#13;
fish, eggs and poultry;&#13;
(d) Phasing out the guaranteed graduate employment policy;&#13;
(e) A more careful choice of investment projects based on each project's&#13;
economic viability determined by using economic prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
Taxes on an average finance about 40% of total public sector&#13;
expenditures. The major non-tax sources of revenue include surplus from&#13;
petroleum, Suez Canal and public sector companies. Public economic sector&#13;
savings finance about 20% of total expenditure. The analysis of public&#13;
economic sector's fiscal performance in Chapter 5 shows that despite the fact&#13;
that 'public economic authorities' (Suez Canal and Petroleum Authorities&#13;
mainly) have generated a large surplus, particularly since 1980/81, in&#13;
aggregate the public economic authorities and the public sector companies&#13;
(state enterprises) both suffer from negative savings-investment gap. In the&#13;
case of public sector companies the gap has also increased over time. The&#13;
main reason for the poor financial performance of public sector companies is&#13;
the lack of autonomy including the lack of effective control over price and&#13;
wage setting and employment decisions. Economic authorities, other than Suez&#13;
Canal and Petroleum authorities, suffer from financial constraints due to&#13;
government control over the pricing of their products. Thus, over the long&#13;
run the greatest scope for reducing the public sector budget deficit is to&#13;
raise public sector savings by increasing prices of goods and services which&#13;
are linked to the budget. This constitutes a very large group which includes&#13;
electricity, petroleum products, natural gas, rail transport, interest subsidy&#13;
on housing and many manufactured products.&#13;
Some amount of deficit financing seems inevitable. It is pointed out&#13;
in Chapter 6 that there is some scope for mobilizing private savings by&#13;
improving the attractiveness of public debt instruments. Public foreign&#13;
borrowings may also be expected to continue to play an important role in&#13;
Egypt's development efforts. Public borrowings, both from abroad and from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiv -&#13;
the domestic private sector, have significant costs and, therefore, should be&#13;
utilized cautiously. In particular, the use of foreign resources in the&#13;
future needs to be planned in such a way that the economy is able to earn or&#13;
save adequate foreign exchange in order to service its debt liability as well&#13;
as to lower future borrowing requirements. Effective use of foreign&#13;
borrowings requires both a proper choice of projects and major structural&#13;
changes in the economy, including a reform of the public economic sector and&#13;
rationalization of prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 1&#13;
Budgel in Relationship to the Public Sector&#13;
I. The Role of Government in the Economy&#13;
1.       Prior to the Second World War, the role of the Government in the&#13;
Egyptian economy was quite limited. The Government did not participate&#13;
directly in any production activity and public investment was confined to&#13;
irrigation, transport infrastructure and utilities including electricity.&#13;
Policy interventions were small and fiscal measures were passive. The war&#13;
period (1939-45) witnessed a surge of controls some of which continued after&#13;
the war. It was, however, the 1952 Revolution which marked the emergence of a&#13;
dominant public sector in the economy. The transformation was completed in&#13;
1961-62 and despite liberalization measures introduced since 1974, the&#13;
Government's role in the economy is enormous. For example, the state accounts&#13;
for 54% of GDP, 40% of total employment and 70% of total investment in the&#13;
economy. Reflecting the Government's greatly expanded role in the economy,&#13;
total public sector expenditure increased rapidly from about 20% of GDP in&#13;
1952/53 to 60% in 1982/83. Public sector revenue growth, however, has not&#13;
matched expenditure growth. Mobilizing resources to finance the public sector&#13;
expenditure has become a major challenge for policy makers in Egypt.&#13;
II. The Structure of t;he Public Sector&#13;
2.       The public sector in Egypt comprises four major bodies:   the Central&#13;
Government, local government, public authorities and public sector companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
The Central Government includes the general administration and public service&#13;
authorities. The public service authorities, as distinct from the public&#13;
economic authorities, do not constitute separate entities and they carry out&#13;
essentially governmental functions such as higher education, public health,&#13;
agricultural research and planning. The local government is organized on a&#13;
regional basis into 25 governorates. Although the local government is&#13;
separate administratively, it has very limited financial autonomy. The&#13;
Central Government controls the budget of the local government which is&#13;
approved by the national legislature as a part of the State budget. The local&#13;
government has jurisdiction over certain types of tax and non-tax revenues,&#13;
but the bulk of its expenditures is financed through Central Government&#13;
transfers. The public economic authorities include activities such as the&#13;
petroleum corporation, railways, the Suez Canal, ports, electricity and water&#13;
supply. The public sector companies consist of state enterprises which engage&#13;
in a wide range of commercial, industrial and agricultural processing&#13;
activities. Together with public economic authorities, they constitute the&#13;
basic vehicle for the implementation of government interventions in the&#13;
economy.&#13;
III. Budgeting Procedure in Relationship to the Public Sector&#13;
3.       Before July 1980 the budgetary procedure followed a complex&#13;
accounting mechanism involving a number of separate budgets and special&#13;
funds. In July 1980 the budgetary procedures were somewhat simplified and the&#13;
fiscal accounting was shifted from a calendar year basis to July 1 - June 30&#13;
period. The State budget, which includes the budget for the Central&#13;
Government, the public service authorities and the local governments, now also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
includes a number of special purpose funds which had previously been outside&#13;
the main budgetary framlework. Public sector companies and public economic&#13;
authorities have their own respective budgets. These are, however, linked&#13;
with the State budget through gross transfers to or from the State budget, and&#13;
through the investment component of the State budget which accounts for the&#13;
total public sector investment. One important change in budgetary procedure&#13;
implemented in July 1980 is that the responsibility for the financing of&#13;
public investment was transferred to the newly constituted National Investment&#13;
Bank (NIB). However, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is still responsible for&#13;
all transactions relating to past investment expenditure. Finally, since the&#13;
beginning of 1980 both the State current and investment budgets have been on a&#13;
cash basis. Although tlhe budgets of the public economic authorities and&#13;
public sector companies remain on an accruals basis, the transactions between&#13;
these entities and the State budget are shown on a cash basis.&#13;
IV. Agencies Responsible for Budget Implementation&#13;
4.       The two main agencies responsible for implementing the budget are the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and the National Investment Bank. The MOF is responsible&#13;
for preparing the budget document and after it is approved by the legislature,&#13;
it is responsible for aLl financial transactions excepting those related to&#13;
new investments. The financing and disbursements of new investments are&#13;
undertaken by the NIB.&#13;
5.       The NIB was established under Law No. 119 in June 1980.   It is&#13;
governed by a Board of Directors under the chairmanship of the Minister of&#13;
Planning. The day to day affairs of the NIB are managed by the Deputy chairman&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
of the Board. The two main objectives of the new institution were first, to&#13;
provide a better linkage between the annual State budgets and the Five Year&#13;
Plan and second, to institute a better coordination and more strict quality&#13;
control in terms of project choice, financing, implementation and follow up.&#13;
The Plan determines the total number of projects to be financed within the&#13;
Plan period. Therefore, in each fiscal year there are a certain number of new&#13;
and on-going projects which need to be financed. The NIB is responsible for&#13;
arranging for the financing of these earmarked projects. The funds are&#13;
disbursed as loans and the borrowing agencies, including the Central&#13;
Government, are required to pay back the principal with interest on the basis&#13;
of an agreed schedule.&#13;
6.       The original provisions of the law underlying the establishment of&#13;
the NIB included a very significant role for the bank in matters of project&#13;
selection, implementation and follow up. So far, the role of the NIB has been&#13;
limited to the financing of the investment budget. Project selection and&#13;
follow up procedures continue to be controlled by the Ministry of Planning.&#13;

Chapter 2&#13;
Structure of the State Budget and Main Fiscal Trends&#13;
I.   A Brief Description of the Budget Document&#13;
1.       The budget document is presented in the form of three separate&#13;
accounts or sub-budgets and a summary account which consolidates all three&#13;
sub-budgets. The sepaLrate accounts are:&#13;
-  the current budget&#13;
-  the capital budget&#13;
-  the investment budget&#13;
The current budget is subdivided into two parts. The first part, called&#13;
Chapter 1, includes the wages bill (excluding armed forces) on the expenditure&#13;
side and tax collecticns on the revenue side. The second part (Chapter 2)&#13;
consists of all other current expenditure items and all non-tax current&#13;
revenue. The items under the consolidated current budget are shown in Table&#13;
1. The expenditure side of the current budget includes current expenditures&#13;
of central government, local government and public service authorities on&#13;
purchase of goods and services for current consumption, interest payments on&#13;
local and foreign debt and expenditure on consumer subsidies.   The revenue&#13;
side includes tax collections by Central and local government, revenue&#13;
proceeds from various service charges and transfers of profits from public&#13;
economic authorities and public sector companies.&#13;

2.       The Capital Budget:   The items entering the capital budget (Chapter&#13;
3) are shown in Table 2. Revenue items are shown under 'financing of capital&#13;
commitments' and expenditure items under 'capital commitments'. On the&#13;
commitments side the capital budget includes amortization payments on foreign&#13;
and local debts, financing of public economic authority current deficits and&#13;
capital transfers from the Treasury to public authorities and public sector&#13;
companies to finance their capital account deficits. The financing of the&#13;
capital budget has a foreign component and a domestic component. The foreign&#13;
financing component consists of non-project loans obtained from outside. The&#13;
domestic component includes capital transfers from public authorities and&#13;
public sector companies and a part of surplus generated in the current budget.&#13;
3.       The Investment Budget:   Under the new arrangement, control over the&#13;
investment budget (Chapter 4) lies with the NIB. The financing of the&#13;
investment budget is shown in Table 3. This is also based on foreign and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
domestic sources. The foreign component consists of all project loans. The&#13;
domestic component includes self-financing of investment by public authorities&#13;
and public sector companies, the social security surplus, savings&#13;
certificates, postal savings, government bonds held by public sector companies&#13;
and public economic authorities, surplus carried over from the previous years'&#13;
investment budget, repayment of principal and interest on investment and&#13;
domestic borrowings from loans extended by NIB and domestic borrowings from&#13;
the banking system including private banks. In addition, if the current&#13;
budget generates a surplus, a part is apportioned to the investment budget.&#13;

4.       Consolidated Treasury Budget:   The Consolidated Budget groups all&#13;
expenditure and revenue items separately (Table 4). Total expenditure is&#13;
obtained as the sum of all expenditures in the three sub-budgets. Total&#13;
revenue is obtained as the sum of current budget revenue, capital transfers&#13;
received by the Treasury from public sector companies and public economic&#13;
authorities (item 5 of financing component of capital budget), investment&#13;
self-financing and installment and interest on NIB loans (items 2 and 9 of&#13;
financing component of the investment budget). 'Gross deficit' is defined as&#13;
the difference of total expenditure and revenue. Financing of the gross&#13;
deficit distinguishes between foreign financing (obtained as the sum of&#13;
foreign financing components of capital and investment budgets) and domestic&#13;
financing (obtained as the sum of all domestic financing components of the&#13;
investment budget except financing from the banking system, i.e., items 2&#13;
through 8). Net deficit is defined as the amount of bank financing required&#13;
to finance the budget deficit.&#13;

5.        Budget by Levels of Government:   The State budget contains a&#13;
disaggregation of fiscal transactions by levels of government. The accounts&#13;
indicate quite forcefully the fact that Egypt has a highly centralized&#13;
structure of government financial authority. The lack of financial autonomy&#13;
at the local government level is illustrated in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. On the&#13;
average local government accounts for 13.6 percent of total government&#13;
expenditures but collects only about 4 percent of total government revenue.&#13;
The bulk of the expenditure is financed through&#13;
Central Government transfers.&#13;

II.   Fiscal Summary Account Used in this Study&#13;
6.       The consolidated budget account used in this study is somewhat&#13;
different from the Egyptian fiscal summary account. The consolidated&#13;
account is shown in Table 6. Tax revenue is divided into 'direct taxes' and&#13;
'indirect taxes'. Non-tax revenue is broken down into 'transferred profits'&#13;
and other non-tax revenue. Total government revenue is defined as the sum&#13;
of tax revenue and other non-tax revenue. Transferred profits (revenue&#13;
items 12 to 14 under the current budget) and investment self-financing are&#13;
grouped together which defines 'public economic sector surplus'. Total&#13;
public revenue is defined as the sum of total government revenue and public&#13;
economic sector surplus. Total expenditure is disaggregated into five&#13;
categories: Central, local and service agencies current expenditure, public&#13;
economic authorities current deficit, subsidies, net capital expenditure,&#13;
investment expenditure. The first category includes all current expenditure&#13;
items shown in the current budget except consumer subsidies which are shown&#13;
separately as the third category. The second category is expenditure item&#13;
number 3 of the capital budget. Category 4 is obtained as the difference&#13;
between all capital expenditure items, except number 3, and domestic capital&#13;
receipts including repayment of investment loans to NIB. Category 5&#13;
(investment expenditure) is self-explanatory. The concepts of gross deficit&#13;
and financing of the deficit are similar. Finally, total public expenditure&#13;
and gross deficit are shown on the basis of commitments rather than actual&#13;
cash transactions. Hence arrears are reallocated to the accounts of the&#13;
years in which actual expenditure occurred.&#13;
III. Main Fiscal Trends&#13;
7.       Three major features which have dominated the recent fiscal trends&#13;
in Egypt are: (a) the increase in total government expenditure as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
proportion of GDP, (b) the high levels of overall 'budget deficit', (c)&#13;
instability in the budget. Table 6 contains a summary of the fiscal&#13;
operations since 1976. Total expenditure as a percent of GDP has increased&#13;
from 55% in 1976 to 60% in 1982/83 and the average overall fiscal deficit&#13;
has remained at around 20% of GDP. The deficit has fluctuated widely from&#13;
17% of GDP in 1977 to 27% in 1979. The instability in the budget is&#13;
essentially due to the fact that government revenues have fluctuated&#13;
relatively more severely than government expenditures. The coefficient of&#13;
variation of government revenue as a proportion of GDP has been about 16%&#13;
compared with 10% for government expenditure as a proportion of GDP.&#13;
8.       The high level of deficit and the budget instability are the&#13;
results of a basic structural weakness of the budget. Budgetary revenues&#13;
are quite susceptible to exogenous influences while budgetary outlays have&#13;
moved closely in line with domestic inflationary pressures. The exogeneous&#13;
influences are transmitted through the growing dependence of the budget on&#13;
petroleum and Suez Canal revenues. The ratio of exogenous revenue to total&#13;
revenue increased from 11% in 1976 to 35% in 1980/81. More importantly, the&#13;
ratio has fluctuated quite significantly, jumping from 15% in 1979 to 35% in&#13;
1980/81 and then falling to 27% in 1981/82. Estimate for 1982/83 indicates&#13;
a further reduction in the share of exogenous resources to about 25%.&#13;
9.       The fluctuations in the fiscal contribution of petroleum and Suez&#13;
Canal is caused by two interrelated factors - fluctuations in the&#13;
international price of oil and fluctuations in the levels of economic&#13;
activities in the Western world. International oil prices reached an all&#13;
time peak during 1980/81 period; the weighted average crude oil price for&#13;

Egypt stood at US$33.29 a barrel. Economic depression in the Western world&#13;
which set in around the end of 1981, coupled with a basic disequilibrium in&#13;
the world oil market caLused by significant 'chiseling' activities within the&#13;
OPEC oil cartel, generated an excess supply situation in the international&#13;
oil market which forced the oil price down. The Egyptian average crude oil&#13;
price fell to US$29.80 a barrel in 1981/82 and is estimated to be only&#13;
US$27.50 a barrel in 1982/83. Economic depression slowed the flow of Suez&#13;
Canal traffic as well causing a reduction in the Suez earnings during&#13;
1981/82. Suez Canal traffic has, however, picked up recently in response to&#13;
improved world economic situation and earnings are somewhat higher this year&#13;
compared with last year.&#13;
10.      There are some influences of exogenous factors on the expenditure&#13;
side as well, but the relative impact is much less. The main exogenous&#13;
influence on expenditure is through the consumer subsidy bill. The size of&#13;
this subsidy, which accounts for about 17% of total government expenditure,&#13;
depends mainly on movements in the international food prices (mainly&#13;
wheat). This is becaus-e imported food items constitute the large bulk of&#13;
subsidized commodities and because the domestic selling price of subsidized&#13;
commodities has been much more stable than procurement prices. In principle&#13;
investment expenditure also should be affected by exogenous factors&#13;

(availability of foreign financing, prices of imported capital goods); but&#13;
in practice the investment expenditure has been used as a discretionary&#13;
instrument including recently short term economic management. The most&#13;
influential factor governing public expenditure is the domestic rate of&#13;
inflation. Under the present budgetary framework, more than 50% of total&#13;
government expenditures (all current expenditure except food subsidy and all&#13;
capital transfers) are largely autonomous and are highly sensitive to&#13;
domestic inflation which has accelerated in recent years.&#13;
IV. Scope of Fiscal Policy&#13;
11.      The combination of susceptibility to exogenous factors on the&#13;
revenue side and strong domestic inflationary influence on the expenditure&#13;
side has posed a serious problem for short term economic management. A&#13;
simplified sequence illustrating the destabilizing influence of the budget&#13;
is as follows. An initial exogenous deterioration in the terms of trade&#13;
causes a reduction in revenue receipts which then raises the level of the&#13;
budget deficit. Given the exogeneity of the level of foreign financing, the&#13;
bulk of the deficit is financed through domestic sources - mainly bank&#13;
financing. A part of the increase in money supply due to Treasury deficit&#13;
financing is offset by a reduction in money supply due to Central Bank&#13;
operations in financing the current account deficit, but most of the effect&#13;
translates into an increase in the money supply. The growth of money supply&#13;
at a rate faster than that at which people are willing to accumulate money&#13;
holdings, causes an increase in the rate of inflation which then feeds back&#13;
into a higher budget deficit in the next fiscal period. Although this is an&#13;
over simplified sequence, it does illustrate the destabilizing effect of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

fiscal policy on macro balances. An active use of fiscal policy would&#13;
require a change in thie budget structure. Dependence on exogenous revenues&#13;
should be reduced whilie the discretionary influence on expenditures should&#13;
be increased.&#13;

Chapter 3&#13;
The Structure and Development of Tax Revenues&#13;
I. Tax Trends&#13;
1.       Tax revenues constitute about 92% of total government revenue and 60%&#13;
of total public sector revenue. Table 7 gives total government revenues in&#13;
the period 1976 to 1981/82. Nominal tax revenues grew at an annual average&#13;
rate of 26% since 1976. Since the domestic inflation rate is estimated to be&#13;
around 17%, tax revenues grew in real terms as well.l/ During the same&#13;
period, average nominal growth rates for business profit, personal income,&#13;
property, consumption, customs and stamp taxes are 37%, 11%, 18%, 21%, 22% and&#13;
28% respectively. The very rapid growth in business profit tax is partly due&#13;
to the tax contribution of petroleum and Suez, but also due to the growth in&#13;
taxes from private commercial and industrial activities. The relatively slow&#13;
growth in property, personal income and consumption taxes reflect the passive&#13;
nature of these tax instruments. Until very recently, the Government did not&#13;
attempt to increase the effectiveness of personal income and consumption&#13;
taxes. The scope of property taxes has been further narrowed with abolition&#13;
of this tax at the Central Government level.&#13;
1/   The rate of inflation is only 12.4% based on the official consumer price&#13;
index (CPI). The official CPI gross underestimates the rate of inflation&#13;
since it is heavily weighted with commodities under price control. The&#13;
estimated rate is based on growth rates of money supply and availability&#13;
of real goods and services.&#13;

2.       Tables 8 and 9 show main taxes as percentage of GDP and the structure&#13;
of taxes respectively. The tax ratio shows an increasing trend but also shows&#13;
significant fluctuations due to the behavior of revenue contributions from&#13;
customs duties and business profit taxes. The instability in customs revenue&#13;
reflects basically the increase in the exchange rate in domestic currency&#13;
units for evaluation of duty liability, following the progressive devaluation&#13;
of the Egyptian pound. The fluctuations in business profit taxes are caused&#13;
by the tax contribution of Suez and petroleum, reflecting instability in&#13;
earnings from these sources.&#13;

consumption tax and stamp taxes. Personal income and property taxes are&#13;
relatively unimportant as sources of Government revenue. The rapid increase&#13;
in business profit tax has lowered the share of all other taxes, except stamp&#13;
duties. In particular, the contribution of personal income and property&#13;
taxes, which were alreasdy quite low before the Open Door Economic Policy,&#13;
declined very significantly. The augmented role of business profit tax&#13;
indicates an apparent improvement in the tax structure. But, if profit taxes&#13;
from petroleum and Suez are excluded, the tax structure is typical of many&#13;
developing countries with reliance mainly on commodity taxes.l/&#13;

II. Development of Main Taxes&#13;
Income Taxes&#13;
4.       The legal basis for taxation of income follows a two-tier system.&#13;
There is a schedular income tax and a global income tax. The schedular income&#13;
tax was established by Law No. 14 of 1939, while the global income tax was&#13;
established in 1949. The schedular taxes are levied on four types of income:&#13;
dividends and interest, profits, professional income and wages and salaries.&#13;
The global income tax is levied on income of individual persons. The tax laws&#13;
have undergone frequent changes. The latest modification was made effective&#13;
July 1981. The objective of the last modification is to move gradually from&#13;
the two-tiered system to a unified system of general income tax.&#13;
Tax on interest and dividends&#13;
5.       This tax is levied on income from movable property comprising&#13;
interest, dividends and royalties earned in Egypt by individuals and&#13;
companies, or earned abroad by Egyptian residents. Interest on capital&#13;
invested by non-residents in Egypt are also taxable. The tax rate was 26% in&#13;
1961 but increased to 40% in 1967. The new tax Law No. 157 of 1981 included&#13;
two modifications. Domestic dividends from joint stock companies are now&#13;
classified under corporate profit and the tax rate has been reduced from 40%&#13;
to 32%. Also, interest income from bonds issued by joint stock companies&#13;
(public or private) which are offered for public subscription are tax exempt.&#13;
Profit Tax&#13;
6.       The profit tax is levied on commercial and industrial profits of all&#13;
establishments operating in Egypt. This tax is levied every year on net&#13;
profits made during the previous year, or during the period of 12 months&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
covered by the last balance sheet. Before Law 157/1981, the tax rate was 40%&#13;
of net profit and the tax base excluded dividends paid out to individuals to&#13;
avoid double taxation since dividends were taxed under the interest income&#13;
category. The new tax law distinguishes between pure public sector companies,&#13;
joint stock companies and partnerships and individuals. Public sector&#13;
companies, except EGPC, are now required to pay 32% of their net profit as&#13;
tax.  EGPC is required to pay 40%.   Dividends of joint stock companies have&#13;
been merged with their profit and they are now required to pay a new tax&#13;
called 'companies tax' at the rate of 32% of net profit. Also, capital gains&#13;
and sale of real estate are tax exempt if such proceeds are used for&#13;
participation in joint stock companies. Finally, the tax on profits of&#13;
partnerships and individual enterprises has been reduced from a 40% flat rate&#13;
to a progressive rate structure as follows;&#13;
20% on first L.E. 1,000&#13;
23% on the next L.E. 1,500&#13;
27% on the next L.E. 2,000&#13;
32% on the remaining.&#13;
Tax on Professional Income&#13;
7.       This tax is levied on the net profits of self-employment in free and&#13;
other non-commercial professions. Before Law 157/1981, deductions for&#13;
dependents were the same as those allowed on income from wages and salaries.&#13;
The tax rate was a flat 11% until 1959. The rate structure was made&#13;
progressive in 1960 as follows:&#13;
11% first L.E. 1,500&#13;
13% on the next L.E. 500&#13;
15% on the next L.E. 1,000&#13;
18% on the next L.E. 2,000&#13;
22% on the remaining.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
The rate structure was increased substantially in 1978. Tax rates were set to&#13;
progress from 29.5% to 43%. Law 157/1981 increased the number of allowances&#13;
and deductions and also lowered the average tax rate. The new rate structure&#13;
is:&#13;
18% on first L.E. 1,000&#13;
20% on the next L.E. 1,500&#13;
25% on the next L.E. 2,000&#13;
30% on the remaining.&#13;
Tax on Wages and Salaries&#13;
8.       This tax is levied on income derived from employment, comprising&#13;
wages, salaries and other emoluments including payment in kind. The rate&#13;
structure has been progressive since it was first levied, but the level of&#13;
exempted labor income and the degree of progression as well as the average&#13;
rate have undergone frequent modifications. The latest change was implemented&#13;
under Law 157/1981. The evolution of the tax since 1952 is shown in Table&#13;
10. The main changes under the new Law are: first, personal allowances are&#13;
now deductible irrespective of family wage income. Under the old system&#13;
allowances were permitted only if the family income from labor is less than&#13;
double the size of the exemption. Second, in addition to family allowances,&#13;
wage earners are allowed to deduct contributions to social insurance and&#13;
pensions, premium paid on life insurance and health schemes, and 10% allowance&#13;
for earning income (transportation) from the tax base. Third, the level of&#13;
exemption has been increased. Finally, both-average and marginal rates are&#13;
now lower.&#13;
General Income Tax&#13;
9.       The general income tax was introduced to improve the progressiveness&#13;
of the income tax. It is paid on the sum of all incomes, including the annual&#13;
rental value of agricultural land. Deductions are allowed for all taxes paid&#13;

Taxes on Property&#13;
Agricultural land tax:&#13;
10.      This tax is levied on all arable land on the basis of its rental&#13;
value, which is assessed every two years. The tax is paid by all landowners&#13;
with holdings exceeding 3 feddans. The tax rate (including defense and&#13;
national security taxes) was 23.8% of annual rental value in 1960/61. It was&#13;
raised to 30.1% in 1973. The tax was abolished in 1981 at the Central&#13;
government level, but the proportion under the jurisdiction of the&#13;
governorates remains and is earmarked for local administration. The basic&#13;
rate is 14% of annual rental value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Tax on buildings:&#13;
11.      Taxes on buildings are assessed either on the basis of actual rents&#13;
or on imputed rental value (for owner occupied buildings). This is an annual&#13;
tax payable by owners of buildings with annual rental value exceeding L.E.&#13;
18.0. A deduction of 20% of the annual rental value is allowed for expenses.&#13;
Before 1981, the rate structure progressed from 20.5% to 68.2% for residential&#13;
buildings and there was a flat rate of 23.2% for non-residential buildings.&#13;
This tax was also abolished at the Central government level in 1981. The&#13;
governorates, however, collect their share of this tax and the proceeds are&#13;
earmarked for this use. The basic rate now is 10% for non-residential&#13;
building and progresses from 10 to 40% for residential building.&#13;
Estate and inheritance taxes&#13;
12.      The estate tax was established by Law 159/1952 which, amended by Law&#13;
202/1960, provided that a tax be levied on the total value of estates of&#13;
deceased persons, including the real and personal property of Egyptian&#13;
nationals and resident foreigners, and rural property in Egypt owned by&#13;
deceased non-resident foreign nationals. The value of the estate is&#13;
calculated net of debts and obligations and the rate ranges from 5% to 40%.&#13;
There is also an inheritance tax which is payable by all persons to whom a&#13;
succession accrues. The value of the estate is calculated net of debts.&#13;
Items exempt from duty include the family house, up to LE 2000 of personal&#13;
life insurance policies, all employer provided life insurance and certain&#13;
miscellaneous things. Since 1960 the basic rate has progressed from 5% to 22%.&#13;
Taxes on Goods and Services&#13;
Taxes on Imports&#13;
13.      Customs Duties:   The customs tariff consists of a single column based&#13;
on Brussels Tariff Nomenclature (BTN). Most duties are ad valorem and are&#13;
applied to a fair market CIF import price. For most imports, customs duties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
are assessed on the basis of the Central Bank exchange rate, except that goods&#13;
entering through non-resident accounts are evaluated on the basis of the&#13;
commercial bank pool exchange rate. Goods in transit and goods which enter&#13;
specified free zones are duty exempt. Customs duties may be refunded on&#13;
imports which are embodied in exports if the re-exportation takes place within&#13;
one year after the duties were paid. There are wide variations in the rate&#13;
structure ranging from 0 to 3000 percent. Capital goods in general have very&#13;
low import tariffs and many types of capital goods are duty exempt. Consumer&#13;
goods have relatively high import tariffs, going up to 3000% for certain types&#13;
of alcohol and its products.&#13;
14.      Development Tax&#13;
Most imported goods are subject to an economic development tax.&#13;
Initially this was set at 10% of c.i.f. value. The rate was reduced to 5% by&#13;
Presidential Decision No. 202/1980.&#13;
Pavement Duty: This is imposed on all imported goods. The rate is&#13;
3% and the base is the sum of import duty, development tax and consumption&#13;
duty payable on a particular imported good.&#13;
Statistic Duty: This is imposed on all imported goods except wheat,&#13;
at the rate of 1% of the c.i.f. value.&#13;
Marine Duty: This is levied on all imported goods transported by&#13;
ship and which are liable to pay import duty. The rate is 0.5% of c.i.f.&#13;
value.&#13;
Taxes on Exports&#13;
15.      Export Customs Duties&#13;
Explicit customs duties are also levied on the exports of a small&#13;
number of commodities. These include, raw hides and skins, metal scraps and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
wastes and antiques. Hides and skins exportation are subject to an export&#13;
duty of LE 1.2 per thousand kilogram, metal wastes and scraps pay export duty&#13;
of LE 11 per thousand kilograms and antiques of an age exceeding 100 years are&#13;
subject to an export duty of 5%. Dutiable exported goods are also liable to&#13;
pay a pavement tax of 3% of assessed export duty and all exported goods are&#13;
required to pay 0.5% marine duty. An implicit export tax is realized by the&#13;
Government on cotton through pricing policy. This shows up in the budget as&#13;
profits from cotton trade.&#13;
16.      Consumption Tax&#13;
A number of commodities, imported or of domestic origin, are subject&#13;
to a consumption tax. The current list includes 53 commodities. Tax drawback&#13;
on exported goods is allowed. The main commodities are coffee, tea, sugar,&#13;
cigarettes, tobacco and products, beverages and a range of consumer goods&#13;
considered of 'luxurious' nature. The duty is either ad valorem or specific&#13;
and there is a fairly large variation in the tax rate. In general, luxurious&#13;
consumer goods, imported cigarettes and imported alcoholic beverages pay&#13;
higher consumption duty.&#13;
17.      Stamp Tax&#13;
Stamp duties are levied on a wide range of documents including deeds,&#13;
applications, contracts, insurance premiums, checks, invoices, lotteries,&#13;
posters and other advertisements, air tickets, supply of electricity, water&#13;
and gas. Stamp duties may be dimensional, specific, graduated or proportional.&#13;
III.     Agricultural Taxation&#13;
18.      Taxation of agricultural income is a classic problem in developing&#13;
countries - in the aggregate agriculture typically constitutes the largest&#13;
economic base but it is too thinly spread to enable cost effective direct&#13;
taxation. The main form of direct taxation of agricultural income is through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
a tax on land holdings. The scope of this tax is very limited due to problems&#13;
of measurement and implementation. Various methods of indirect taxation of&#13;
agriculture are possible. These include: compulsory procurement at&#13;
controlled prices, cropping area restrictions and taxation of agricultural&#13;
inputs. These schemes have been used in varying forms by developing&#13;
countries. A key issue is the effect on farmer incentives. Excessive&#13;
indirect taxation of agriculture may result in severe disincentive effects on&#13;
production and consequently have an adverse impact on economic growth.&#13;
19.      In Egypt agriculture accounts for 20% of GDP, 37% of total employment&#13;
and more than 50% of total non-oil exports. The relative importance of&#13;
agriculture has declined over the years, but in terms of structure of&#13;
commodity production, it still ranks as number one. Direct taxation of&#13;
agricultural income through land taxes is very limited. Prior to 1981, this&#13;
tax was collected at both central and local government levels. Since July&#13;
1981 this tax is collected only by the governorates. The tax revenue in&#13;
1981/82 amounted to only LE 57.0 million, which is less than 1% of&#13;
agricultural value added.&#13;
20.      Indirect taxation of agriculture in Egypt is based on two major&#13;
schemes:&#13;
- compulsory procurement at controlled prices,&#13;
- determining cropping pattern through area restrictions.&#13;
The different combination of these schemes for the major crops are summarized&#13;
in Table 11. The procurement prices are substantially below world prices.&#13;
The resultant taxation of agriculture (as illustrated by the account ratios)&#13;
is only partially channelled to the Treasury as cash revenue (through cotton&#13;

export profits), but mostly spills over as subsidies on industrial inputs and&#13;
final consumption goods. A part of the disincentive effects of indirect&#13;
taxation is neutralized by subsidies on agricultural inputs - chiefly&#13;
irrigation, water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds and diesel. But, on the&#13;
whole, there is substantial net taxation of agriculture. The net tax rate for&#13;
the sector as a whole is estimated to have increased from about 12% in 1975 to&#13;
about 14% in 1981.2/&#13;
IV.      Evaluation of the Tax Structure&#13;
21.       Taxes perform three types of functions:   mobilize resources for&#13;
financing government expenditure, provide incentives to individuals and&#13;

&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
enterprises to improve resource allocation, and change the pattern of income&#13;
distribution. Taxes vary in terms of the differential effects on the three&#13;
objectives and the challenge for policy makers is to select the particular mix&#13;
which provides the 'best' combination. Apart from the controversy as to what&#13;
constitutes an optimal tax structure, even if an optimal tax structure could&#13;
be devised, its implementation would be constrained by institutional&#13;
bottlenecks. Nevertheless, numerous criteria have been proposed for&#13;
evaluating the ex-post tax performance of countries. These evaluations&#13;
provide useful guidelines for making changes in the tax structure.&#13;
22.      In this section the revenue performance of the Egyptian tax structure&#13;
will be assessed in terms of two main criteria.: tax effort and tax&#13;
buoyancy. The incentive and income distribution effects of taxes will be&#13;
discussed in the next section.&#13;
V.       Tax Effort Analysis&#13;
23.      Tax effort analysis has drawn a fair amount of attention in recent&#13;
times.- . The basic idea is that different countries have different types&#13;
of tax base or 'tax handles'. These tax handles depend mainly on the&#13;
structure of the economy. Hence, the amount of tax revenue that can be&#13;
mobilized depends quite significantly on the structure of the economy. Once&#13;
the tax handles are identified the question may be raised; is the country&#13;
making adequate effort to realize its tax potential? One methodology&#13;
developed in the literature is to express the ratio of tax revenue to GDP as&#13;
1/ See in particular: Alan A. Tait et al "International Comparisons of&#13;
Taxation for Selected Developing Countries, 1972-76", IMF Staff Papers,&#13;
Vol. 26, March 1979 and Raja J. Cheliah "Trends in Taxation in Developing&#13;
Countries", IMF Staff Pepers, Vol. 15, July 1971.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
a function of certain key factors which affect tax handles. Then, using&#13;
cross-country data and regression techniques predict the potential ratio for&#13;
each country. An international tax comparison (ITC) index is obtained finally&#13;
by dividing the actual ratio to the potential ratio. Countries with an index&#13;
exceeding unity are considered as making satisfactory tax effort and their&#13;
fiscal problems are caused by other factors. The problem with this approach,&#13;
as numerous critics have pointed out, is that tastes relevant to the public -&#13;
private goods mix would -differ across countries which would have a significant&#13;
influence on the tax ratio. Therefore, two countries seeking to equate the&#13;
marginal social benefits of private and public goods may end up having quite&#13;
different tax ratios and yet one may be considered as making unsatisfactory&#13;
tax effort based on ITC index. Nevertheless, ITC indices provide a useful&#13;
summary measure for evaluating the tax structure, provided it is not used&#13;
mechanically. It is not a normative measure of 'tax effort', but gives some&#13;
indication as to whether the tax handles have significantly additional&#13;
potential for generating more revenue.&#13;
24.      The capacity to tax depends on a number of factors.    Some of the&#13;
important ones are:&#13;
(1) the level of economic activity&#13;
(2) the sectoral composition of the economy&#13;
(3) the openness of the economy&#13;
(4) share of mining in exports&#13;
The level of economic activity, as measured by per capita GNP, is expected to&#13;
have a positive effect on the tax ratio. Two important considerations&#13;
relating to the sectoral composition of the economy are the share of&#13;
agriculture in GDP and the share of mining (including petroleum) in GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Since the practical problems of taxing agriculture directly are quite serious,&#13;
the tax ratio and share of agriculture in GDP are expected to be negatively&#13;
related. The openness of the economy, measured either in terms of total&#13;
exports as a ratio of GNP, or total value of trade (exports plus imports) as a&#13;
proportion of GNP is expected to have a positive effect on the tax ratio.&#13;
Finally, the share of mining (including petrolem) and tax ratio are expected&#13;
to be positively associated. The potential tax ratios are computed for 45&#13;
developing countries by regressing tax ratio on different combinations of the&#13;
above determinants. ITC indices and regression results corresponding to each&#13;
specification and data sources, are contained in Annex I. For the text, a&#13;
particular specification is chosen. This specification computes the tax ratio&#13;
as a function of per capita non-export income, share of mining in GDP and&#13;
share of non-mineral exports in GNP. The reason for choosing this&#13;
specification is that it makes it possible to compare the updated results of&#13;
the present exercise with results of previous periods obtained by other&#13;
reseachers. The comparison is made in Table 12.&#13;
25.      There has been considerable shift in the ranking of countries by ITC&#13;
indices over time. One important reason for these shifts is the emergence of&#13;
the oil sector as an important source of tax revenue. For this paper the main&#13;
interest is Egypt's relative position. Both 1969-71 and 1978-80 ITC indices&#13;
rank Egypt quite high relative to other developing countries. It, however,&#13;
receives a low ranking in terms of 1972-76 ITC index. The 1978-80 result is&#13;
not very sensitive to specification. Regardless of the specification used,&#13;
Egypt shows an ITC index exceeding unity and there are marginal changes only&#13;
in relative ranking in response to changes in specification (Annex 1). Thus,&#13;
based on the most recent result, it may be concluded that Egypt's tax&#13;
performance compares favorably with other developing countries.&#13;

26.      Tax Revenue Buoyancy:   Tax revenue buoyancy measures the&#13;
proportionate response of tax revenue received by the Government to variations&#13;
in some measure of economic activity, usually GDP. This is closely related to&#13;
the concept of tax revenue elasticity. A change in tax revenue between two&#13;
periods might occur due to two reasons: first, due to a change in the&#13;
economic activity to which tax collections are related and second, due to a&#13;
change in the tax rate. The first source of the change is called 'automatic'&#13;
or 'built-in' change and the second source is known as 'discretionary'&#13;
change. Tax buoyancy measures the total response of tax revenue whereas tax&#13;
elasticity measures only the automatic or built-in response.&#13;
27.      Point estimates of tax revenue buoyancy with respect to GDP at&#13;
different levels of disaggregation are presented in Table 13 /. Total tax&#13;
revenue, with or without the tax contribution of petroleum and Suez Canal,&#13;
shows a buoyancy value exceeding one. The buoyancy estimate improves if&#13;
petroleum and Suez based tax revenues are excluded.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
The disaggregated picture indicates that business profit tax is the most&#13;
buoyant tax instrument. Consumption tax has a buoyuancy value exceeding&#13;
unity, but property and personal income taxes have buoyancy values which are&#13;
less than one. The buoyancy of customs duties with respect to value of total&#13;
imports is close to unity. Thus, while on the aggregate tax revenue is quite&#13;
responsive to GDP, at the disaggregated level the responsiveness of personal&#13;
income and property taxes is not satisfactory.&#13;
28.      The favorable revenue performance of the tax structure in terms of&#13;
tax effort and overall buoyancy indicates that Egypt's fiscal problems are&#13;
caused by excessive growth in government expenditure. Taxes on an average&#13;
finance about 40% of total expenditure. The major non-tax sources of revenue&#13;
include surplus from petroluem, Suez Canal and public sector companies.&#13;
Public economic sector savings which finance about 20% of total expenditure&#13;
have shown significant instability. The challenge for Egypt lies in reducing&#13;
the reliance on unstable sources of revenue by increasing the fiscal&#13;
contribution of public sector companies and monitoring expenditure growth in&#13;
line with resource availability, but without adversely affecting economic&#13;
growth.&#13;
VI.      Economic Effects of the Tax System&#13;
29.      Taxation and Income Distribution.    Taxes are important instruments&#13;
of income distribution. Unfortunately, very little is known about the&#13;
distributive effects of the Egyptian tax system. A recent study made an&#13;
exploratory attempt to obtain some evidence on this.-/ The main finding of&#13;
1/ M. Reda El Adel, op. cit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
the study is that the tax system, including consumer subsidies, which is&#13;
defined as a negative tax, had a favorable effect on income distribution. The&#13;
gini coefficient of income for 1974/75 is 0.4043 before taxes and 0.3792 after&#13;
taxes. The evidence, however, is not conclusive and also the data used in the&#13;
study are not current. In view of the lack of direct evidence, only&#13;
qualitative judgements can be made regarding the income distribution&#13;
implications of the tax system in Egypt.&#13;
30.      There are two aspects of equity;   "horizontal equity" and "vertical&#13;
equity". Horizontal equity requires 'equal treatment of equals', meaning that&#13;
people at the same level of income should bear the same tax burden. Vertical&#13;
equity requires 'taxation according to ability to pay', implying that people&#13;
with higher income should bear a higher tax burden. Satisfaction of both&#13;
aspects of equity requires that the tax base should include all sources of&#13;
income, earned or unearned, and that the tax rate should vary according to&#13;
income levels rather than income sources. There are problems with the&#13;
Egyptian tax structure regarding both equity aspects. The principle of&#13;
horizontal equity has suffered because of the following factors. First,&#13;
taxation of income is largely based on a schedular system with the tax rate&#13;
varying according to the source of income. Second, earned income is taxed at&#13;
a higher rate than unearned income. For example, capital gains are taxed only&#13;
if it is 'realized'. Similarly, taxes on property are almost negligible.&#13;
Third, large tax exemptions have been granted to foster private investment and&#13;
moreover there is substantial tax evasion. Both have tended to erode the tax&#13;
base for a selective income group.&#13;
31.      From the point of view of vertical equity or taxation 'according to&#13;
ability to pay', the tax progression is of special interest. In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
discussion of the legal tax structure, it was shown that taxation of all&#13;
sources of personal income, except dividends and interests, follow a&#13;
progressive rate structure. The supplementary global income tax schedule also&#13;
incorporates significant progression. If assessment and collections were&#13;
effective, the income tax system would accomplish a substantial equalization&#13;
of incomes. But the low effectiveness of implementation reflected by&#13;
insignificant revenue contribution of personal income taxation indicates the&#13;
weakness of the tax structure in terms of vertical equity as well.&#13;
32.      The large share of indirect taxes in total taxes is also a matter of&#13;
concern in terms of tihe equity content of the tax structure. The regressive&#13;
impact of indirect taxes might be expected to be offset to a large extent by&#13;
consumption subsidies. But in view of the open-ended nature of subsidies, it&#13;
is difficult to present a definite view on the overall impact of indirect&#13;
taxes and subsidies on tax progression.&#13;
Taxation and Incentives&#13;
33.      The incentive effects of taxes depend on the incidence of the taxes.&#13;
In practice all taxes have disincentive effects and the real issue is the&#13;
trade-off between incentives, revenue and income distribution. As in the case&#13;
of the distributive implication of the Egyptian tax system, very little&#13;
attention has been paid to this issue.Given the lack of quantitative evidence,&#13;
only qualitative judgements can be made.&#13;
34.      The most important source of revenue is the business profit tax.&#13;
This is also the tax instrument actively used by the government to encourage&#13;
private investment in the economy. Incentives have been provided in two&#13;
forms. First, under 'Law No. 43/1974 (amended in 1977) foreign private&#13;
investments have been exempted from all taxes for a period of 5 years from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
first fiscal year following commencement of production. Such exemptions apply&#13;
for the same period to the proceeds of the profits which are reinvested in the&#13;
enterprise. Second, the new tax Law 157/1981 made special provisions for&#13;
encouragement of the establishment of joint stock companies, public and&#13;
private. The special provisions include:&#13;
(1) tax exemption on interest income from bonds issued by joint stock&#13;
companies provided these bonds are offered for public subscription;&#13;
(2) tax exemption of interest in bonds issued by public sector banks as&#13;
well as the interest on bonds issued by these banks in which public&#13;
sector capital accounts for more than 5% and which are registered&#13;
with the Central Bank, if these bonds are issued with the aim of&#13;
financing projects within Egypt;&#13;
(3) tax exemption on profits resulting from the revaluation of assets of&#13;
an establishment owned by an individual or partnership when these&#13;
assets are used for participation in joint stock companies;&#13;
(4) tax exemption on real estate transaction if used for a joint stock&#13;
company.&#13;
What is not clear, however, is the relative cost and benefit of these&#13;
incentives. The issue as to whether the benefits of these incentives exceed&#13;
the revenue loss is quite important and merits a careful analysis.&#13;
35.      The bulk of commodity production subject to profit taxation is under&#13;
price control while services are relatively free. To some extent the impact&#13;
of price control on output is offset by subsidy input, but on the whole the&#13;
present incentive structure favors services production and is biased against&#13;
commodity production. Given that a major objective of the Government is to&#13;
divert resources from services into commodity production and full price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
flexibility is not likely to be achieved in the near future, with a higher&#13;
rate of taxation of services profit would tend to lower the overall&#13;
disincentive effect on commodity production. But at present profits from&#13;
services and commodity are taxed at the same rate. The disincentive effects&#13;
are therefore similar.&#13;
36.       Although infant industry development has played an important role in&#13;
the design of import tariff structure, the main objective was revenue&#13;
generation. This can be seen from Table 14. Except for basic metals and&#13;
transport equipment, effective protection due to tariffs is negative for&#13;
public sector industries. Basic metals and transport equipment activities&#13;
show negative value added at world prices partly due to large effective&#13;
protection accorded by the import tariff structure. In the case of the&#13;
private sector, customs duties have provided significant effective protection&#13;
to activities classified under other textiles, metals and engineering products&#13;
and building materials, but food processing and textile related spinning&#13;
activities experienced negative effective protection.&#13;

37.      Although public sector industries are subject to price controls on&#13;
output, they have also received significant subsidy through access to&#13;
controlled price inputs. The overall impact of price control, input subsidy&#13;
and tariff protection has been quite dispersed. In the case of other textile&#13;
and food processing, the two largest industrial activities in Egypt, negative&#13;
effective protection due to tariff and price control on output have reinforced&#13;
each other to offset the positive incentive effect of access to subsidized&#13;
inputs, thereby resulting in a large negative overall effective protection for&#13;
these two activities. But input subsidies offset the negative protection&#13;
accorded by tariffs on other textiles, paper, basic chemicals and electric&#13;
machinery, and reinforced the tariff based effective protection on basic&#13;
metals and transport. The private sector is not subject to output price&#13;
control, and they have largely benefitted from the system of tariff protection.&#13;
38.      While the overall disincentive effect of tariffs and price controls&#13;
is mixed for the aggregate industrial sector, the impact is clearly adverse&#13;
for agricultural production. Except for meat and milk, all major agricultural&#13;
activities experienced negative effective protection, basically due to price&#13;
controls on output.-Y&#13;
VI.      Strengthening the Tax System&#13;
39.      As discussed above, although the level of taxation in Egypt is not a&#13;
major issue, there are problems regarding equity and incentive aspects of&#13;
taxation. These include: relatively strong reliance on indirect taxes,&#13;
insignificant role of personal income and property taxes, large dependence on&#13;
schedular tax system with tax rates varying according to source of income,&#13;
large tax exemptions which are subject to abuse and low tax compliance. A&#13;
1/ See World Bank, Trade Strategy Report, op. cit, page 180&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
number of possibilities exist to improve the tax system in Egypt. These are&#13;
discussed briefly below.&#13;
40.      Business Profit Tax: Revenue from business profit tax can be&#13;
increased by taking a imore careful look at the cost aspect of the various&#13;
exemptions provided to attract foreign and domestic private investments. It&#13;
is very important to undertake a detailed study of the impact of these&#13;
incentives and compare the benefits with the costs. Also, it would be useful&#13;
to assess whether non-tax incentives may be substituted for tax incentives to&#13;
minimize loss of revenue. At present profits from commercial activities are&#13;
taxed at the same rate as production activities. It may be desirable to&#13;
discriminate in favor of the production sectors and, therefore, have a higher&#13;
tax rate for commercial activities.&#13;
41.      A major problem with the business profit tax is the low level of&#13;
compliance. Under Law 157/1981 the Government has implemented a number of&#13;
changes to improve voluntary compliance. These include a reduction in the&#13;
average rate of tax, an increase in the level of tax exempt profit and a&#13;
reduction in the marginal tax rate for partnership and individual&#13;
enterprises. At the same time, several steps have been taken to improve the&#13;
tax assessment and collection procedures of the tax administration. These&#13;
include an increase in the number of tax collection offices at the governorate&#13;
level, better tax records and imposition of strict penalties for tax evasion&#13;
and delays. Although the full impact of these measures will not be realized&#13;
for some time, 1982/83 profit tax collections are estimated to have increased&#13;
by about LE 200 to 250 million.&#13;
42.      Personal Incoime Tax: The main problem with personal income tax is&#13;
the low level of compliance. This is due to weaknesses in the tax assessment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
and collection machinery. At present most of personal income tax is collected&#13;
through schedular taxes on wages and salary and self-employment. The role of&#13;
the global income tax is very limited. Additional revenues can be raised and&#13;
a more equitable tax structure introduced by moving from the present system of&#13;
schedular and global income taxes to a unified global personal income tax and&#13;
combining this shift with a stronger tax administration machinery. The&#13;
Government has recently taken some steps in this respect. A team of U.S.&#13;
Internal Revenue Service experts are looking at the issues of income tax&#13;
unification as well as improved assessment procedure on the basis of computer&#13;
records. Some administrative changes in tax collection procedures have been&#13;
introduced as well. The seriousness with which the required changes are&#13;
implemented will determine the impact of these measures on revenue collection.&#13;
43.      Consumption Tax:   The present selective excise tax on consumption is&#13;
too narrowly based. A broad based general sales tax would constitute a&#13;
significant improvement in the tax structure. The tax should be ad valorem&#13;
rather than the present mix of a combination of specific and ad valorem&#13;
rates. Like the present excise tax, the tax should not also discriminate&#13;
amongst imports and domestic production and the tax rebate may be extended to&#13;
exports. At present there is no indication that a broadly based sales tax be&#13;
introduced. The Government response has been to continue with the system of&#13;
selective excise tax, but increase the number of commodities under the scope&#13;
of this tax (Law 133/1981). The revenue effect of this measure is estimated&#13;
to be around L.E. 250 million in 1982/83.&#13;
44.      Customs Duty: A very easy way for augmenting revenue collection from&#13;
customs duties is to switch from the present procedure of assessing duty on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the bulk of imports baEsed on the Central Bank pool exchange rate (LE 0.7 =&#13;
1.00 US$) to the commercial exchange rate (LE 0.84 = 1.00 US$). It is&#13;
estimated that the change would generate additional revenue of about L.E. 400&#13;
million. Another problem with customs duties is that the variation in the&#13;
rates of duties within broad commodity groups is too wide. A more unified&#13;
system would help reduce the distortionary effects of the import tariff. As&#13;
in the case of business profit taxes, it is important to look more carefully&#13;
at the costs and benefits of customs duties exemptions. Also, customs duty&#13;
collection procedure need to be strengthened. In particular, the continued&#13;
leakages of duty free imports from free zones to the rest of the economy need&#13;
special attention. The Government has made some effort recently to correct&#13;
the existing loopholes and revenue from customs duties are expected to&#13;
increase by 24% in 1982/83, despite a reduction in the value of imports (due&#13;
to import controls as well as reduction in import prices). The issue of the&#13;
use of commercial bank pool exchange rate for assessment of customs duty&#13;
liability, however, remains unresolved.&#13;

Analysis of Public Sector Expenditure&#13;
I. Composition and Structure&#13;
1.       The composition and structure of public sector expenditures by main&#13;
categories are shown in Table 15. The three main characteristics underlying&#13;
the recent trends in public sector expenditures arez&#13;
a)   the large role of autonomous expenditure (defined as the sum of&#13;
current expenditures, economic authority deficit and net capital&#13;
transfers;l/&#13;
b)   the growing importance of subsidies as a major budgetary expenditure;&#13;
and&#13;
c)   the slowdown in the growth of investment expenditure.&#13;
2.       Between 1976 and 1980/81, autonomous expenditures declined relative&#13;
to subsidy and investment expenditures due to very rapid growth rates in the&#13;
latter two categories following the very favorable resource situation which&#13;
emerged in Egypt'during 1974-1980/81 period. The increase in budgetary&#13;
subsidies is a reflection of the Government's policy of protecting the living&#13;
standards of the poorer people in the face of the growing concentration of&#13;
incomes and rapid inflation. The growth in investment expenditures, on the&#13;
other hand, indicates both the response of the Government to ease up the&#13;
physical infrastructure bottlenecks which had gained prominence with the surge&#13;
in the level of economic activity in this period, and the attempt to&#13;
reorganize the&#13;
1/ These are autonomous in the sense that the degree of discretionary&#13;
influence is very small.&#13;

industrial base into a more modern and capital intensive structure.&#13;
3.       With the emergence of resource tightness since 1981/82, the relative&#13;
importance of autonomous expenditures has increased, following rapid growth in&#13;
this component due to high rates of inflation and the Government policy to&#13;
absorb a part of the impact of decline in resource availability by limiting&#13;
growth in investment and subsidy expenditures. The 1982/83 experience&#13;
illustrates this quite dramatically. There is a big jump in the share of&#13;
autonomous expenditure and significant decline in the shares of subsidy and&#13;
investment expenditures.&#13;
4.       A similar picture is indicated by the responsiveness of expenditure&#13;
and its main component to GDP (Table 16). Total expenditure, investment&#13;
expenditure and subsidies all show buoyancy values exceeding one. But the&#13;
responsiveness of autonomous expenditure with respect to the general price&#13;
level is much larger than the responsiveness with respect to GDP.&#13;
II. Growth and Structure of Autonomous Expenditure&#13;
5.       The largest component of autonomous expenditure is current&#13;
expenditure. Despite the decline in relative share, current expenditures in&#13;
the period 1976-1981/82 grew at an annual average rate of 22%, which implies a&#13;
real growth rate of 5%. The estimated increase in nominal current expenditure&#13;
for 1982/83 is much larger - 32% over 1981/82. The main reason for the rapid&#13;
growth in current expenditure is increases in defense appropriations and the&#13;
wage bill. The growth in the wage bill has been more due to increase in the&#13;
level of employment in government services than due to wage adjustments. The&#13;
relative unattractiveness of government jobs in terms of wages and salaries is&#13;
fairly well known. The large increase in government employment reflects&#13;
basically the policy of providing guaranteed employment to graduates.&#13;

6.       Since 1979 the expenditure on interest payments (domestic and&#13;
foreign) has assumed significant proportions (Table 17). Interest payment on&#13;
domestic public debt in particular has increased quite rapidly. This is the&#13;
consequence of growth in Treasury borrowings to finance the budget deficit.&#13;
The more than doubling of domestic interest payments in 1982/83 is, however,&#13;
more apparent than real. This includes interest payments of about LE 200&#13;
million by the Treasury ito the Central Bank which reverts back to the Treasury&#13;
in the form of Central Bank profit transfer.&#13;

7.       The growing burden of the public debt since 1979 has also resulted in&#13;
increased budgetary expenditure on amortization payments (Table 18). Outlays&#13;
on the amortization of foreign debt are expected to grow even faster in the&#13;
future given the repayment profile on increasingly large amounts of loans.&#13;
The other component of capital transfers expenditure - loans to public&#13;
economic authorities and public sector companies to cover their capital&#13;
commitment deficits, reflect two important aspects of the state budget which&#13;
is often overlooked: (a) the complexities of financial transactions between&#13;
the Treasury and public economic enterprises and (b) the fact that there are&#13;
large dispersions in the earnings of various public economic enterprises. The&#13;
flow of funds between the Treasury and public economic enterprises and the&#13;
issue of financial contribution of these enterprises will be discussed in some&#13;
detail in Chapter 6.&#13;

8.       Apart from financing capital deficits of public economic authorities,&#13;
the Treasury is also responsible for financing their current deficits. Such&#13;
deficits reflect the inability of some of these authorities to cover their&#13;
current costs of production. The railway authority accounts for the bulk of&#13;
the current deficit financed by the Treasury. This inability is induced by&#13;
the lack of autonomy, in particular regarding price setting, for these&#13;
organizations. Since current deficits arise because the organizations cannot&#13;
charge consumers their cost of production, they constitute a kind of subsidy&#13;
for the users.&#13;
III.     Growth and Structure of Budgetary Subsidies&#13;
9.       Subsidies first entered as a budgetary item in 1950, but it was not&#13;
until 1973 that it gained prominence. Since then, subsidy expenditure, has&#13;

increased at a very rapid rate. For example, between 1976 and 1981/82,&#13;
nominal subsidy expenditure grew at an annual average rate of 36 percent. The&#13;
structure of direct subsidy for the period 1976 to 1982/83 is given in Table&#13;
19. The most important category of direct subsidy is food which alone&#13;
accounts for about 70% of total subsidy expenditure. Other items include&#13;
transport, agriculture input subsidies on fertilizer and pesticides, interest&#13;
subsidy on agriculture and housing credits, consumer subsidies on textiles,&#13;
kerosene, bottled gas, newspaper and various types of industrial goods&#13;
produced by nationalized industries. In view of its dominant role, the growth&#13;
and structure of food subsidies are analyzed below in greater detail.&#13;
IV.      An Analysis of Food Subsidies&#13;
10.      The growth in budgetary expenditure on food subsidies may be&#13;
explained by two factors:&#13;
(a) increase in the composition and volume of subsidized goods;&#13;
(b) increase in the rate of subsidy.&#13;
11.      The amounts of major subsidized food commodities for the period 1976&#13;
- 1981/82 are shown in Table 20. It is clear that the quantities of goods&#13;
subsidized for each category increased quite significantly during this&#13;
period. For example, subsidized quantities of wheat, flour and maize grew at&#13;
annual average rates of 6.5, 13.6 and 19.1 percent respectively compared with&#13;
a population growth rate of about 2.8% per annum. Similarly, the quantities&#13;
of lentils, oils and food and animal fats grew at annual average rates of 4.4,&#13;
4.9 and 3.8 percent respectively. The fastest growing items in recent years&#13;
have been: sugar, meat and fish (all with relatively high income&#13;
elasticities). But despite this, wheat, flour and maize remain as the first,&#13;
second and third most important commodity and together account for about 80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-52 -&#13;
percent of the total food subsidy bill. The bulk of the subsidized goods&#13;
continue to be procured through imports. The only exception is sugar for&#13;
which domestic procurement is relatively more important.&#13;

V.       The Rate of Subsidy&#13;
12.      The rate of subsidy expressed as a share of the cost price for each&#13;
commodity for the period 1979 to 1981/82 is presented in Table 21. The&#13;
subsidy rate for most commodities is fairly high. In general, the rate of&#13;
subsidy is higher for foodgrains. There has been some change in the rate of&#13;
subsidy between 1979 and 1981/82. The subsidy rates for wheat, oil, edible&#13;
fat, beef and chicken show some decline, while those for flour, beans,&#13;
lentils, eggs, fish anid sugar show an increase.&#13;

13.      The selling prices of subsidized commodities are relatively more&#13;
stable than the procurement prices, particularly imported ones. This is an&#13;
important reason for the fluctuations in the rate of subsidy. For example&#13;
the changes in the rate of subsidy between 1980/81 and 1981/82 are entirely&#13;
due to fluctuations in the imported prices of subsidized goods since selling&#13;
prices remained unchanged (Annex 2).&#13;
14.      As indicated by the large variations in the rate of subsidy, the&#13;
absolute difference between procurement price and sales price decreased for&#13;
some commodities and increased for others. The quantities of subsidized&#13;
goods, however, increased for all categories. The increase in the nominal&#13;
subsidy bill is, therefore, an outcome more of the increase in the volume of&#13;
subsidized goods than the widening of the absolute price gap. The relative&#13;
role of the two factors for the period 1979 - 1981/82 for each commodity is&#13;
indicated in Table 22. There are significant differences in the contribution&#13;
of the two factors. The increase in wheat subsidy is entirely due to the&#13;
increase in quantity. For flour the increase in the price gap is more&#13;
important. Maize, beans, lentils, fish and sugar show large increases for&#13;
both quantity and price gap. The increase in the price gap, however, is&#13;
relatively more important for beans, lentils and sugar while increase in&#13;
quantity is more important for maize and fish. Quantities of chicken, oil and&#13;
beef increased fairly rapidly, but the price gap narrowed for these&#13;
commodities. The decline in the price gap for edible oil more than offset the&#13;
increase in the quantity. Similarly, the decline in the price gap for animal&#13;
and edible fat offset the increase in quantity of this commodity.&#13;

VI.      Hidden or Implicit Subsidies&#13;
15.      Budgetary suLbsidies reflect only explicit subsidy expenditure&#13;
incurred by the government. Even such subsidy is underestimated because all&#13;
imported subsidized goods channeled through GASC are evaluated at the Central&#13;
Bank pool exchange rate. The food subsidy bill would be much larger if a more&#13;
realistic exchange rate were applied to calculate the c.i.f., price of&#13;
imported subsidized goods in domestic currency units. Quite apart from this,&#13;
a major source of implicit or hidden subsidy is supply of energy products to&#13;
domestic consumers at a price which is far below the opportunity cost (the&#13;
f.o.b. price or the c.i.f. price). The value of the subsidy is estimated at&#13;
more than L.E. 2.0 billion per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VII.      Investment Expenditure&#13;
16.      The final component of government expenditures is investment outlays&#13;
of the combined public sector. Between 1976 and 1981/82 nominal investment&#13;
expenditure grew at an annual average rate of 29%. The growth in investment&#13;
expenditure was quite uneven. The 1976-1978 period saw a big surge in&#13;
investment expenditure, particularly in 1978 when the share of investment&#13;
expenditure reached a high of 43% of total expenditure and 24% of the GDP.&#13;
Since 1979, the share of investment expenditure has been declining. The&#13;
slowdown is noticeable particularly in 1982/83.&#13;
17.      The decline in the rate of growth of public investment is partly due&#13;
to the government policy of reducing investment expenditure in response to&#13;
resource tightness in the economy and partly due to physical absorptive&#13;
capacity constraints. The physical constraints have shown up in terms of&#13;
inadequate availability of overhead, such as transport, construction materials&#13;
and skilled workers, as well as institutional bottlenecks.&#13;
18.      The structure of investment shows that public sector investment has&#13;
concentrated on three major sectors: industry, energy (mainly electricity)&#13;
and transport and communication (Table 23). These three together account for&#13;
about 70% of total public sector investment. In view of significant excess&#13;
capacity in public industries, a large part of industrial investment has been&#13;
for replacement and modernization. This has meant an increase in the capital&#13;
intensity of these enterprises. Further, capacity expansion has concentrated&#13;
on energy intensive (such as fertilizer) and capital intensive (engineering&#13;
and metallurgical products) activities. In general, therefore, new&#13;
investments have augmented the capital intensity of industrial production.&#13;
The large increase in electricity and transport investments reflect the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Government's efforts to relieve the physical absorptive capacity constraints&#13;
in the economy. Power availability does not appear to be a major bottleneck&#13;
at present, but transportation problems remain quite serious.&#13;

VIII.    Economic Effects of Government Expenditure&#13;
19.      Like taxes, government expenditures are important fiscal instruments&#13;
for affecting the distribution of income and resource allocation in the&#13;
economy. Given the very large role of the public sector in Egypt, an analysis&#13;
of the economic effect's of government expenditure is extremely important.&#13;
Unfortunately, except for some partial attempts to determine the income&#13;
distribution effects of food subsidies, no systematic effort has been made to&#13;
determine the incidence of government expenditure. The efficiency aspect of&#13;
public investments in agriculture and industry have been studied in some&#13;
detail in a recent World Bank report.&#13;
Food subsidies and income distribution&#13;

program in Egypt is included in a World Bank study country economic report on&#13;
Egypt.-/ The main conclusion of the study is that the food subsidy program&#13;
is fairly cost effective mainly because of the dominance of the food grains in&#13;
the subsidy program. A similar result on the cost effectiveness of foodgrain&#13;
subsidy was obtained in a recent report on shadow prices for Egypt.2/ Both&#13;
studies, however, questioned the justification of subsidies on meat, fish and&#13;
sugar on income distribution grounds.&#13;
Income distribution effects of other public expenditures&#13;
21.      Apart from direct food subsidies, the Government has attempted to&#13;
improve the income distribution through two other channels. These are (a)&#13;
expenditure on health and education and (b) subsidies through price controls&#13;
on transport and on industrial goods, interest subsidy for housing finance and&#13;
guaranteed employment program for graduates. These expenditures are not&#13;
targetted towards any specific income group, but in practice it is likely that&#13;
higher income groups have benefitted relatively more due to their stronger&#13;
socio-politic influence.&#13;
Resource allocations effects of government expenditure&#13;
22.      Resource allocation and growth in the economy are affected directly&#13;
by the size and structure of public investment expenditure. Also, very&#13;
important indirect effects are transmitted through price controls and&#13;
subsidies. The resource allocation implications of pricing policy has already&#13;
been discussed in Chapter 3. A brief economic analysis of public investment&#13;
is presented below.&#13;

23.      Public sector investment accounts for about 70% of total investment&#13;
in the economy. Apart from the provision of infrastructure facilities, the&#13;
main direction of such investment has been towards the provision of industrial&#13;
goods in the economy. The efficiency of the public sector industrial&#13;
investment has been studied in some depth in a recent World Bank report./ &#13;
The findings of the study indicate very low levels of efficiency for most&#13;
investments. There are large discrepancies for almost all sectors between&#13;
financial and economic profitability. Sectors with good financial&#13;
profitability generally show low economic profitability and vice versa (Table&#13;
24). This result is not surprising given the pervasiveness of controls&#13;
(prices, wages, financial and management) in the economy.&#13;
24.      The bulk of public sector industrial investments has concentrated on&#13;
the production of goods for the domestic market - basically wage goods. As a&#13;
result, the export performance of public enterprises has been very weak.&#13;
Industries oriented towards exports suffer from inadequate incentives,&#13;
including overvaluation of the exchange rate and ineffective tax rebate&#13;
system. A further problem is that the growing capital and energy&#13;
intensiveness of public investment has limited the ability of public&#13;
enterprises to create productive employment.&#13;
25.      Public investments in electricity and transport played a large&#13;
development role by easing up physical bottlenecks constraining Egypt's&#13;
economic progress in the early 70s. Nevertheless, there are significant&#13;
issues of efficiency for these investments as well. In particular, available&#13;
evidence tend to indicate that investments in electricity and transport were&#13;

not based on least cost solutions. Moreover, the returns from these&#13;
investments have been lowered significantly due to inadequate attention to&#13;
maintenance and repairs of facilities.&#13;
26.      Finally, the main thrust of agricultural investment has been towards&#13;
provision of irrigation and drainage facilities and land reclamation. These&#13;
investments were aimed at easing up two major bottlenecks: the growing&#13;
problem of rising water tables and soil salinity and the acute shortage of&#13;
arable land further exacerbated by the mounting population pressure. Both&#13;
investments achieved only limited success in realizing the objectives. The&#13;
amount of investment in, drainage and irrigation infrastructure proved&#13;
inadequate relative to the magnitude of the need. Moreover, there is some&#13;
evidence that the returns from implemented projects are low relative to&#13;
potential. There are important issues of design and construction standards of&#13;
completed projects. Further, maintenance of old network is a perennial&#13;
problem. The track record on land reclamation efforts is not very encouraging&#13;
either. After a large impetus in 1960s, land reclamation was deemphasized in&#13;
1970s due to very low returns from such efforts. The reasons include&#13;
insufficient drainage and irrigation facilities, inadequate soil studies,&#13;
institutional constraints, and insufficient financial resources. Since the&#13;
beginning of 1980 land reclamation efforts have gained prominence once again.&#13;
Given long gestation periods and high capital intensity, progress towards&#13;
completion of projects have been slow. Consequently, short term output&#13;
effects are negligible.&#13;
IX.      Policy Measurets for Rationalizing Public Sector Expenditure&#13;
27.      The review of public sector expenditures indicates quite clearly the&#13;
fact that there is considerable room for improvement in managing public sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
expenditure. Some of the important expenditure measures are discussed below.&#13;
(a) As a general policy, the discretionary component of budgetary expenditures&#13;
has to be increased in order to make it possible to use fiscal policy as&#13;
an active tool of stabilisation. This would require a reduction in the&#13;
rate of growth of current expenditures and transfers, and making&#13;
expenditures more responsive to non-exogenous resources in the economy.&#13;
(b) While it is true that food subsidies have a favourable effect on income&#13;
distribution, a number of improvements in the administration of subsidy is&#13;
possible. First, the open-ended system of subsidy should be replaced with&#13;
a more target group olriented system. The Government has recently reduced&#13;
the number of ration card holders by restricting eligibility. While this&#13;
is an encouraging first step, additional measures have to be taken to&#13;
ensure only target groups benefit from subsidies. Second, to keep the&#13;
budgetary cost of the subsidy scheme in reasonable proportion it is&#13;
necessary that the rate of subsidy be gradually adjusted downwards. This&#13;
would require frequent adjustments in the selling price of subsidized&#13;
goods to reflect movements in procurement prices. The present policy of&#13;
the Government is to restrict total outlay on subsidies at the level of&#13;
L.E. 2.0 billion in 1981/82 prices. Apart from the fact that this&#13;
represents a large sum of money, there is no definite program as to how&#13;
this would be achieved. One scheme under active consideration is to&#13;
introduce different grades for each commodity. The quality differential&#13;
would then serve as a basis both for some increase in effective price and&#13;
channeling the subsidy to the poorer group. There is very little action&#13;
even on this as yet. Third, the subsidy on non-essential items such as&#13;
meat, fish, eggs and poultry should be phased out gradually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(c) Interest subsidy for housing and subsidy through price controls on&#13;
industry and energy products do not necessarily improve income&#13;
distribution since tlnese are not target group specific. For example, the&#13;
present policy of charging 4% interest on housing loans has caused an&#13;
excess demand for such loans. It is generally believed that the bulk of&#13;
these loans has concentrated in the hands of the more well-to-do group in&#13;
the economy. Also, it has adversely affected the growth of housing&#13;
finance institutions and availability of loanable funds. Similarly, price&#13;
controls on industry and energy products have resulted in wastage and&#13;
misallocation of resources which are far in excess of whatever beneficial&#13;
effects they are expected to have in terms of income distribution. The&#13;
need for phasing out such controls is fairly well established by now and&#13;
recognized by the Government. A comprehensive program, however, has yet&#13;
to be formulated.&#13;
(d) The policy of guaranteed employment for graduates constitutes a drain on&#13;
resources and should be phased out. One step undertaken by the Government&#13;
to reduce the fiscal burden of this policy is to increase the job search&#13;
period for graduates before they can apply for entitlement under this&#13;
scheme, thus making the scheme less attractive. This, however, does not&#13;
solve the basic problem that the very existence of the scheme provides&#13;
wrong signals, i.e. distorts choice in favour of general graduate studies&#13;
at the expense of technical studies. The economic cost of this distortion&#13;
in the long run may be even more important than the budgetary cost of&#13;
providing the jobs.&#13;
(e) Investment expenditure is the most important fiscal tool for affecting&#13;
resource allocation and growth in the economy directly. Given growing&#13;
resource constraints, it is extremely important that new investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
decisions be based on a careful evaluation of each project's economic&#13;
viability. The growth and sectoral composition of investment should be&#13;
based on the future economic needs of the country. For example, the World&#13;
Bank report on issues of trade strategy and investment planning-/ has&#13;
demonstrated the need both to augment the rate of investment as well as&#13;
increase the share of investment in commodity production, mainly export&#13;
based and import substitutes.&#13;

The Fiscal Role of Non-Government&#13;
Public Economic Sector&#13;
I. Fiscal Linkages Between the Treasury and the Public Economic Sector&#13;
1.       The public economic sector comprises two major institutions:   public&#13;
economic authorities and public sector companies. The budgetary procedures&#13;
allow both institutions to have separate budgets, but these are linked to the&#13;
State general budget through a number of transactions. Table 25 shows the&#13;
various flow of funds between public economic sector and the Treasury.&#13;

1/ This applies only for public economic authorities&#13;
2.  Treasury Inflow Itera&#13;
Business Profil: Tax: Public sector companies and public economic&#13;
authorities are required to pay a tax on their operating profit. At present&#13;
the tax rate is 40% for the Petroleum Authority and 32% for all others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Transfer of Profit: Public sector companies are required to&#13;
transfer 65% of their surplus available for distribution to the&#13;
Treasury..Y/ Petroleum and Suez Canal Authorities transfer about 85% of&#13;
their post tax surplus to the Treasury.&#13;
Self-financing of Investment: A part of the surplus remaining&#13;
after profit transfer is retained by enterprises as undistributed profits.&#13;
These resources are used for financing investment of enterprises which&#13;
generate them. Retained earnings are not physically transferred to the&#13;
Treasury (or the NIB) but total investment expenditures include investments&#13;
financed through retained earnings.&#13;
Installments and Interests: All investment loans extended to&#13;
public enterprise before 1981 are required to be paid back to the Treasury&#13;
with interest in accordance with an agreed schedule. Installments and&#13;
interests on new investment loans are required to be paid directly to NIB.&#13;
3.       Treasury Outflow&#13;
Investment Loansz Until June 1981, all approved investments&#13;
concerning public sector companies and public economic authorities were&#13;
financed by the Treasury. Since 1981/82 these investments are financed by&#13;
the NIB.&#13;
Capital Transfer Loans: The Treasury makes transfer payments to&#13;
finance the deficit of the capital budgets of public sector companies and&#13;
public economic authorities.&#13;
1/ In practice transferred profits have constituted a much lower percentage&#13;
of post tax profit. Public sector companies have tended to keep a much&#13;
larger proportion as retained earnings which shows up as self-financing&#13;
of investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Transfers to Lower Current Deficit of Public Economic Authorities:&#13;
The Treasury is also responsible for financing the current budget deficits&#13;
of public economic authorities.&#13;
Direct Subsidies from the Special Fund: One form of consumer&#13;
subsidy is through control over prices of public sector company products&#13;
(industrial goods and petroleum products). The Treasury makes direct&#13;
payment from the special subsidy fund to the affected public enterprises to&#13;
compensate for their 'Loss.&#13;
4.       Tables 26 anl 27 give the magnitudes of the various transactions&#13;
between the Treasury and the public economic authorities and public sector&#13;
companies for the period 1979 - 1982/83. On the aggregate public sector&#13;
companies receive much more financial resources from the Treasury than they&#13;
give back. But public economic authorities taken together provide more&#13;
funds to the Treasury than they receive from it.&#13;
II. Savings-Investment: Gap&#13;
5.       A more interesting way of analyzing the flow of funds is to look at&#13;
the savings-investment gap of public economic authorities and public sector&#13;
companies (Table 27). The three striking features which emerge are:&#13;
(i) The savings-investment gap for public sector companies has&#13;
increased over time.&#13;
(ii) Despite significant growth in surplus generated by petroleum and&#13;
Suez Canal authorities, particularly since 1980/81, in the&#13;
aggregate public economic authorities are also characterized by&#13;
negative savings-investment gap.&#13;
(iii) There are significant fluctuations in the savings generated by&#13;
public economic authorities.&#13;

The first factor is an indication of the poor financial performance of&#13;
public sector companies in the aggregate. The second and third factors&#13;
reflect both the budgetary dependence on exogenous resources (petroleum and&#13;
Suez Canal revenue) - a characteristic which was highlighted in Chapter 2&#13;
and the pricing policy of the Egyptian government with respect to public&#13;
services.&#13;
6.       The main reason for the poor financial performance of public sector&#13;
companies is lack of autonomy including lack of effective control over price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
and wage setting and employment decisions. Although the financial&#13;
performance of public sector companies taken together is not satisfactory,&#13;
some companies have done fairly well. The dispersion in the earnings of the&#13;
public enterprises are yet another indication of the ad-hoc nature of price&#13;
controls and subsidy schemes. While many enterprises have experienced&#13;
financial constraints due to price controls, some enterprises have&#13;
benefitted significantly from the explicit and implicit subsidies. But as&#13;
stated above, most firms showing high financial profitability have low&#13;
economic profitability. Given the fact that a high proportion of profits&#13;
have been retained by companies for reinvestment, new investments have&#13;
tended to perpetuate the inefficiency problem.&#13;
7.       The GovernmLent has recognized the problem of lack of autonomy and&#13;
made some attempts in the past to correct this distortion. For example, in&#13;
1976 all general organizations were abolished and public sector companies&#13;
were allowed in principle to exercise greater discretion in all matters&#13;
pertaining to price formation, wage payment and employment. But in practice&#13;
very little was achieved and the Government has retained effective control&#13;
over all three kinds of key decisions. The Government policy towards&#13;
state-owned enterprises is presently under review. A public sector company&#13;
Reform Bill has been drafted and is being discussed. This draft reform bill&#13;
contains provisions allowing public sector companies greater effective&#13;
flexibility with respect to management of financial resources, wage setting&#13;
and employment decisions. Also, public sector companies would be given the&#13;
same tax incentives as accorded to private industries. The Government would&#13;
retain control over the price formation, but prices would be made more&#13;
responsive to cost of production and any State subsidy intended for final&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

consumers would be provided through the distribution, not production,&#13;
channels. Apart from the issue of adequacy of the proposals in the Bill,&#13;
the more worrisome factor is the slowness with which it is being processed.&#13;
There are no clear indications at present as to how soon this would be&#13;
enacted and with what final provisions.&#13;

Financing Public Sector Fiscal Deficit&#13;
I.       The Sources of Financing Budget Deficit&#13;
1.       In recent periods Egypt has experienced very large fiscal&#13;
deficits. This has emerged as a major problem for economic management for&#13;
the present. The problem arises due to two reasons. First, large fiscal&#13;
deficits are often a reflection of the growing indebtedness of the country&#13;
to the rest of the world (i.e., a large deficit in the current account of&#13;
the balance of payments). Second, if the fiscal deficit is financed largely&#13;
by Treasury borrowings from the Central Bank and the increased liquidity is&#13;
not offset by either Central Bank operations in financing the balance of&#13;
payments current deficit or reduced liquidity to other domestic&#13;
institutions, significant inflationary pressures may be generated in the&#13;
economy. Both concerns have emerged in Egypt.&#13;
2.       The various sources of financing the budget deficit in Egypt are&#13;
given in Table 29. The structure of financing of the budget deficit shows&#13;
an increase in the share of domestic financing relative to foreign financing&#13;
(Table 30). The reduct:ion in the reliance on foreign financing is basically&#13;
due to the problem of mobilizing foreign resources rather than due to a&#13;
change in the strategy of the Government to move towards increasing&#13;
self-reliance. This is quite clearly indicated by the growth in the&#13;
reliance on bank financing. Except in 1980/81, bank financing was the&#13;
largest source of domestic financing for the budget deficit. Amongst&#13;
non-bank domestic sources, the surplus from the social security fund is the&#13;
most important source.&#13;

Foreign financing&#13;
3.       Foreign financing of the budget deficit is in the form of two types&#13;
of loans: credit facilities for the development plan which are project&#13;
specific loans for investment and cash and commodity loan which are&#13;
non-project type loans. The bulk of foreign financing is through project&#13;
specific loans. Although share of foreign financing has declined, there has&#13;
been significant growth in total foreign financing (16% between 1976 and&#13;
1982/83).&#13;

Domestic financing&#13;
4.       Non-bank domesl:ic financing:  The main source of non-bank domestic&#13;
financing is the social security surplus. The growing reliance on this source&#13;
of funds is indicated by the rapid increase in the growth rate of the surplus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
(annual average rate of 25% between 1976 and 1981/82). The other important&#13;
domestic non-bank source is public borrowings through the savings certificate&#13;
scheme. Availability of funds through this channel has increased at an annual&#13;
average rate of 36 percent. Mobilization of resources through postal savings&#13;
and Government bonds do not appear to have worked well. Recently the&#13;
Government introduced special development bonds. There are some indications&#13;
that this may emerge as an important source of deficit financing in the future.&#13;
5.       Bank financing:   The most important feature underlying the structure&#13;
of financing of the budget deficit is the increasing role of bank financing.&#13;
The large reliance on bank financing has caused an expansion in the supply of&#13;
money in the economy at a rate faster than the rate of expansion of the demand&#13;
for money. The imbalance has generated significant inflationary pressures in&#13;
the economy causing problems for resource allocation as well as income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
II. Public Sector Savings - Investment Gap&#13;
6.       It is useful to view the problem of financing public sector deficit&#13;
in terms of the public sector savings-investment gap. A given public sector&#13;
investment program can be financed through three sources:&#13;
(a) public sector savings&#13;
(b) foreign savings&#13;
(c) private savings&#13;
If it is assumed that foreign savings are exogenous, the basic fiscal problem&#13;
for policymakers is to mobilize sufficient resources from public and private&#13;
sectors to finance the public investment program. The effort should also take&#13;
into consideration the potential trade-off between financing of public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
investment and private investment. Excessive public borrowings could have&#13;
real crowding out effects on the financing of private investment.&#13;
7.       The pattern of public sector savings and the public sector&#13;
savings-investment gap are contained in Table 31. The widening of the public&#13;
sector savings investment gap is mainly due to large government dissavings.&#13;
The table illustrates quite dramatically the fact that the rapid increase in&#13;
gross non-government public sector financial savings, mainly due to increase&#13;
in petroleum and Suez Canal earnings, have been largely dissipated in&#13;
financing government consumption and transfers rather than financing the&#13;
investment program.&#13;
III. Public Finance in Egypt: Summary and Conclusions&#13;
8.       Egypt's public finances are unusual in several respects compared to&#13;
those of other countries at similar income levels. The public sectors&#13;
dominance in its economy requires the mobilization and expenditure of a vast&#13;
amount of resources. Total public expenditures are 60% of GDP, total revenues&#13;
are 40% of GDP and the public sector deficit is 20% of GDP. There are very&#13;
few, if any, developing countries in the world with such high proportions.&#13;
These heighten the normal fiscal issues of the efficiency, equity and&#13;
development impact of public sector economic operations.&#13;
9.       Since the mid-1'970s, both public consumption and investment have&#13;
grown rapdily, financed by the rapid rise in public resources. The outlook&#13;
for the continuation of ithe rapid rise in these easily co-opted resources is&#13;
dim and consequently there is need to review the structure of public&#13;
expenditure to ensure that available resources are being used in the best way&#13;
possible. While the economy would benefit from a curtailment of government&#13;
consumption expenditures and consumer subsidies, there is a need to maintain&#13;
and even increase government investment expenditure.&#13;

10.      Perhaps the greatest scope for reducing the public sector budget&#13;
deficit is to raise public sector savings by increasing prices of goods and&#13;
services which are linked to the budget. This constitutes a very large group&#13;
which include food items, electricity, petroleum products, natural gas, rail&#13;
transport and many manufactured products. Many of these prices have been kept&#13;
at unrealistically low levels despite accelerating inflation and an&#13;
increasingly overvalued exchange rate with the result that the government&#13;
controlled prices are far apart from economic prices. There are compelling&#13;
efficiency reasons for raising these prices as their low levels have&#13;
encouraged patterns of consumption and production that are quite wasteful of&#13;
Egypt's resources. Equally compelling is the need to raise prices to augment&#13;
the savings of the public economic sector and thus reduce the growing&#13;
investment-savings gap.&#13;
11.      The level and method of taxation is another important issue.   At&#13;
about 25% of GDP, taxation in Egypt is high compared to other countries but&#13;
low compared to public expenditure. As already discussed, there is scope to&#13;
increase taxes through avoidance of erosion of the bases; both in the case of&#13;
business taxes and in the case of custom duties, tax exemptions devised to&#13;
improve economic incentives are subject to misuse. In the case of custom&#13;
duties, tax yields can be increased by the expedient of valuing imports at the&#13;
commercial bank exchange rate rather than the present practice of using the&#13;
official exchange rate. Regarding consumption taxes, the present selective&#13;
excise taxes can be replaced by a broad based sales tax.&#13;
12.      Some amount of deficit financing will be inevitable.   Although both&#13;
foreign financing and the social security surplus can be expected to continue&#13;
growing in nominal terms, they are unlikely to grow rapidly enough to obviate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
the need to borrow from the private sector. Mobilization of private savings&#13;
through government borrowing is currently restricted by the underdeveloped&#13;
nature of the capital market in the economy. Major efforts will be required&#13;
to develop a well functioning capital market. Even if such efforts are&#13;
forthcoming, it would take quite a while for the market to operate&#13;
effectively. For the short run an important policy measure would be to&#13;
improve the attractiveness of public debt instruments. Raising of funds&#13;
through domestic borrowing may, however, increase the level of deficit in the&#13;
future due to the increasing burden of debt servicing. A more desirable&#13;
change in policy would be to allow private participation in the ownership of&#13;
public enterprises. This change, however, can only be very gradual since it&#13;
presupposes the existence of an effective capital market.&#13;
13.      Finally, there is a need to monitor foreign borrowings more&#13;
carefully. Large accumulation of foreign debt could endanger the&#13;
creditworthiness status of a country. Although the foreign debt situation in&#13;
Egypt has not reached alarming proportions, the growing debt service burden is&#13;
a matter of concern. Moreover, the large inflow of foreign resources into the&#13;
public sector, excluding petroleum, do not appear to have sufficiently&#13;
augmented the capacity to earn foreign exchange. The use of foreign resources&#13;
in the future need to be planned in such a way that the economy is able to&#13;
earn or save adequate foreign exchange in order to service its debt liability&#13;
as well as to lower future borrowings requirement. Effective use of foreign&#13;
borrowings requires both proper choice of projects and major structural&#13;
changes in the economy, including reform of the public economic sector and&#13;
rationalization of prices.&#13;

IV. Implications for Further Research&#13;
14.      The objective of this paper was to present an overview of Egypt's&#13;
public finances, focussing on major issues relating to mobilization of fiscal&#13;
resources and identifying certain key areas of policy reform. A major&#13;
conclusion of this stucly is that the greatest potential for mobilizing&#13;
resources lies in improving the financial performance of the decentralized&#13;
public sector. Given the present inadequacy of knowledge, a study of the&#13;
decentralized public setctor finances would be crucial in designing an&#13;
appropriate financial reform package. The paper pointed out that there are&#13;
significant tax exemptions are offered as fiscal incentives for augmenting&#13;
private investment, some of which are also subject to abuse. It would be&#13;
useful to take a careful look at the budgetary cost of various fiscal&#13;
incentives and compare it with the benefits. The implications of fiscal&#13;
policy for resource allocation and income distribution were touched upon very&#13;
briefly and in qualitative terms only. Quantitative studies of the impact of&#13;
budget on income distribution, particularly consumer subsidies and implicit&#13;
energy subsidies, would yield useful insights on the appropriateness of such&#13;
subsidies in relation to the stated objectives and also provide a basis for&#13;
policy reform. Finally, the paper argued for a gradual reduction in the&#13;
reliance on international trade taxes and increase in the reliance on domestic&#13;
sales taxes. A quantitative study of the appropriate restructuring of tariffs&#13;
and sales taxes in the Light of the twin objectives of revenue and efficiency&#13;
would be of significant interest to policy makers who are often reluctant to&#13;
modify the tariff structure on grounds of losing revenue.&#13;

ITC Analysis&#13;
Data Sources and Estimation Technique&#13;
1.       Data used in deriving ITC indices are contained in Table 1.   The data&#13;
are drawn from three main sources:&#13;
-    International Financial Statistics (IFS) published by the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF).&#13;
-    Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS), published by the IMF.&#13;
-    World Development Report (WDR), published by the World Bank.&#13;
As in previous studies, non-tax revenue and social security contributions are&#13;
excluded. Local government revenue is included for only those countries where&#13;
it exceeds 10% of total tax revenue. All data are converted into US dollar&#13;
units using official exchange rates reported in IFS.-/&#13;
2.       All equations are estimated using ordinary least square (OLSQ)&#13;
methodology. There may be simultaneity bias in the coefficient estimates but&#13;
a consistent estimation technique such as two-stage least squares (2SLS) was&#13;
not considered in order to retain maximum comparability with earlier&#13;
estimates. The bias is, however, not likely to be significant. Alan Tait et&#13;
al reported in their work that they did not detect serious simultaneity bias&#13;
when they compared OLSQ estimates with 2SLS estimates. Table 2 contains ITC&#13;
indices based on five alternative specifications, while Table 3 gives&#13;
correlation coefficients for the alternative estimates. Finally, Table 4&#13;
shows the regression results for the alternative specifications.&#13;
1/ GNP is defined in market price terms. The appropriate measure should be&#13;
GDP at factor cost plus net factor income. Due to lack of data this&#13;
adjustment was not done.&#13;

            Public finance in Egypt : its structure and trends
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Egypt's public finances are unusual
            in several respects compared to those of other countries at
            similar income levels. The high proportions of public
            expenditures, revenues, and public sector deficit to GDP
            heighten the normal fiscal issues of the efficiency, equity,
            and development impact of public sector economic operations.
            This study focuses on a number of key issues in this area.
            After a brief description of the composition of the
            government's official budget document, the study
            discusses recent budgetary trends, the structure of taxes
            with special emphasis on tax performance, the composition
            and trend of public expenditure, the implications of the
            government budget for income distribution and resource
            allocation, the financial contribution of public sector
            enterprises, and the financing of the budget deficit. The
            paper makes specific recommendations relating to each key
            aspect discussed, i.e. tax effort, public expenditure, the
            fiscal role of public enterprises, and deficit financing.
