 Impact studies have been completed in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam (2008). Options studies are in progress currently in those four countries&#13;
and in the Yunnan Province of China. In South Asia, the India Impact Study was commenced in 2008 and completed in 2010. Impact studies are also being carried&#13;
out in Pakistan and Bangladesh.&#13;

     from review are the costs of informal healthcare and home                programs, including the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban&#13;

     related to inadequate solid waste management and drainage.               greater investments will continue to be dedicated to the&#13;
     A number of adverse impacts have also had to be excluded                 national agenda of achieving clean, livable cities. This study&#13;
     from the present analysis because of a lack of robust data.              confirms that investments being made in rural sanitation&#13;
     These include intangible welfare benefits, such as the                   and those proposed for urban sanitation are but critical&#13;
     comfort and acceptability of sanitation arrangements; lack of            public investments. This study underlines the finding that&#13;
     convenience and privacy; lack of security, status, and dignity,          substantial investments are not only needed but can be&#13;
     especially for women and children. Poor environmental                    regarded as effective only when they result in reducing the&#13;
     outcomes, including objectionable appearance, poor air                   morbidity and mortality, the harmful impacts on drinking&#13;
     quality, bad odors, and other aesthetic values have not been             water, the costs to welfare, and the negative impact on&#13;
     accounted for either. Other major questions that remain                  tourism that are all associated with inadequate sanitation.&#13;
     to be answered concern how inadequate sanitation affects                 This study further suggests the need for a new monitoring&#13;
     trade and businesses and how it impacts the productivity                 framework. There is a clear need to measure not just the number&#13;
     of populations in different locations. These impacts are                 of toilets or their use or the number of sanitized communities&#13;
     substantial and cannot be ignored, but it is difficult to impute         and cities, but also the impacts of poor sanitation on health-&#13;
     economic values to them because robust data is lacking and               related, water-related, environmental, and welfare-related&#13;
     there are conceptual difficulties as well. In other words, the           indicators. Finally, the huge market for sanitation products and&#13;
     full impact of inadequate sanitation is likely to be much                services provides an additional basis for crowding in private&#13;
     higher than the estimates in this report show, since a number            investments in the sector by adjusting public policies.&#13;
     of health, welfare, social, and environmental dimensions are&#13;
     not captured in the economic analysis.                                   Areas deserving further empirical research and regular&#13;

Since sanitation is linked in many ways to livelihoods and              handling of water, and personal hygiene) that break down the&#13;
sustainable development in general, it also contributes to              separation of human excreta from human contact and thus expose&#13;
MDG 1, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and                      people to fecal-oral pathogens.&#13;
MDG 3, promoting gender equality and empowering women,&#13;
and MDG 5, improving maternal health.                                   Poor sanitation kills and causes diseases&#13;
                                                                        Conventionally, most diseases related to poor sanitation have&#13;
As evidence from East-Asian countries shows and as this                 been lumped into the category of â&#128;&#156;water-borne diseases.â&#128;?&#13;

imposes a substantial economic burden on nations (Hutton et al.,        of water-related diseases are in fact in the fecal-oral category&#13;
2008). Figure 1.1 presents the pathways by which improved               (Cairncross, 2003). A considerable body of scientific&#13;
sanitation brings about first-order impacts and then leads to           knowledge has established that diseases caused by poor&#13;
many economic impacts that add up to substantial gains.                 sanitation and hygiene are viral, bacterial, parasitic, protozoal,&#13;
                                                                        helminth, and fungal in nature (Hutton et al., 2008).&#13;

Sanitation is a broad subject covering the management of                of a latrine, through water or other fluids, person-to-person,&#13;
human excreta, hygiene practices, and the management of                 by flies, or via soil. Food can also act as an intermediary&#13;
domestic, industrial, and medical wastes, animal wastes,                for all of these direct transmission pathways (Hutton et al.,&#13;
drainage, among other things. This study looked at a core set           2008). Figure 1.2 shows how disease transmission takes place&#13;

       A Gram Panchayat is the lowest elected tier of local self-government in rural India, usually comprising one or more revenue villages.&#13;
     7&#13;
       The Government of India estimate of coverage is calculated on the basis of access to any type of latrine (sanitary or otherwise). In addition, it is reported that between 2005-06 and&#13;
     2008-09, a large number of toilets were constructed in rural India under the Total Sanitation Campaign and by private investments. These factors explain the considerable difference&#13;
     between the National Family and Health Survey N-3 estimate presented in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.3.&#13;

       Depending on population size, Gram Panchayats receive `50,000 to `500,000 as prize; Nirmal blocks receive `1-2 million, and totally sanitized districts receive `3-5 million&#13;

        BOx 1.1 NATIONAL URBAN SANITATION POLICY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        The vision of the National Urban Sanitation Policy is this:&#13;
        All Indian cities and towns become totally sanitized, healthy, and livable; and ensure and sustain good public health and environmental&#13;
        outcomes for all their citizens with a special focus on hygienic and affordable sanitation facilities for the urban poor&#13;
        and women.&#13;
        To transform urban India into community-driven, totally sanitized, healthy, and livable cities and towns, the policy sets out the&#13;
        following goals:&#13;
        A AWARENESS GENERATION AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE&#13;
        a) Generating awareness about sanitation and its linkages with public and environmental health amongst communities&#13;
           and institutions&#13;
        b) Mechanisms to bring about and sustain behavioral changes aimed at adoption of healthy sanitation practices&#13;
        B OPEN-DEFECATION-FREE CITIES&#13;
        a) Promoting access to households with safe sanitation facilities (including proper disposal arrangements)&#13;
        b) Community-planned and managed toilets wherever necessary, for groups of households who have constraints of space, tenure&#13;
           or economic constraints in gaining access to individual facilities&#13;
        c) Adequate availability and 100 percent upkeep and management of public sanitation facilities in all urban areas to rid them of&#13;
           open-defecation and environmental hazards&#13;
        C INTEGRATED CITY-WIDE SANITATION&#13;
        1. Re-orienting institutions and mainstreaming sanitation:&#13;
        a) Mainstream sanitation in all sectors and departmental domains as a cross cutting issueâ&#128;&#148;especially in urban management&#13;
        b) Strengthening national, state, city, and local institutions (public, private, and community) to accord priority to&#13;
           sanitation provision&#13;
        c) Extending access to proper sanitation facilities for poor communities and other un-served settlements&#13;
        2. Sanitary and safe disposal: 100 percent of human excreta and liquid wastes must be disposed of safely.&#13;
        a) Proper functioning of network-based sewerage systems and ensuring connections of households to them wherever possible&#13;
        b) Proper disposal and treatment of sludge from on-site installations (septic tanks, pit latrines, etc.)&#13;
        c) All the human wastes are collected, safely confined, and disposed of after treatmentâ&#128;&#148;no hazard to public&#13;
           health or environment&#13;
        3. Proper operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) of all sanitary installations:&#13;
        a) Promoting proper usage, regular upkeep, and maintenance of household, community, and public sanitation facilities&#13;
        b) Strengthening Urban Local Bodies to provide, or cause to provide, sustainable sanitation services delivery&#13;
        The policy envisages the preparation of State Sanitation Strategies within the overall national policy framework. In turn, cities are&#13;
        expected to prepare their citywide sanitation plans, assisted by the state government and the Ministry of Urban Development.&#13;

While there is no explicit allocation for urban sanitation, the       the government initiated in 1980-81 for the replacement&#13;
Ministry of Urban Development (2008) reported in November             of service latrines and the rehabilitation of workers engaged&#13;
2008 that 19 percent of the National Urban Renewal Missionâ&#128;&#153;s          in the occupation of manual cleaning. About 2.3 million&#13;
projects (66) pertained to sanitation. Regarding the scheme for       service latrines (of the 5.4 million reported by the 1989&#13;
small and medium towns, 94 of its 662 approved projects (as           National Sample Survey) were converted into sanitary ones&#13;
of October 2008) pertained to sewerage. Investment in slum            by July 2007, and more than 50,000 scavenging workers&#13;

urban sanitation was made when the government, in discussion          The guidelines for this scheme were revised with a new target&#13;
with the states, constituted a National Urban Sanitation Task         of converting 600,000 dry latrines into water-borne flush&#13;

Considerable policy progress has been made in the                     protection of river water quality. Beginning with the National&#13;
implementation of the National Urban Sanitation Policy in             River Conservation Plan in the early 1980s, this ministry has&#13;

strategies. The Ministry of Urban Development and external            for a variety of reasons. In 2009, the National Ganga River&#13;
agencies have funded cities to prepare city sanitation plans,         Basin Authority was established, and it has approved Mission&#13;
and 150 cities were doing so as of August 2010. Several state         Clean Ganga with an aim to stop all untreated municipal&#13;

&#13;
     This study followed a standard peer-reviewed methodology          Census of India and related&#13;
     based on the ESI (East Asia and Pacific) with adaptations         population projections&#13;
     and modifications made for the Indian context. This chapter       Estimates based on Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2001 Census are used for&#13;
     provides a brief overview of the scope of the sanitation          population projections for the years 2006 to 2020 (TGPP&#13;
     analysis and explains which impacts have been included,           and NCP, 2006).&#13;
     how attribution has been made to sanitation, how economic&#13;
     valuations have been carried out, and what aspects have           National Sample Survey&#13;
     been excluded.                                                    National Sample Survey (NSS) is an annual national&#13;
                                                                       economic survey conducted by the National Sample Survey&#13;
     The study was carried out at the national level in India. While   Organization (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and&#13;
     it involved analyses of sub-national data, the estimations were   Program Implementation. Summary statistics on employment,&#13;
     made for national-level impacts. They have been disaggregated     workforce participation, unemployment, and other aspects&#13;
     as appropriate into rural and urban domains and age-classes       from Report No. 522, based on the 62nd round of the survey&#13;
     wherever the data permitted this.                                 in 2005-06, are used in this report (NSSO, 2007). The present&#13;
                                                                       study uses estimates from NFHS-3 for consistency with other&#13;

     The main sources of data for this study included:                 NFHS-3â&#128;&#148;for example for the populationâ&#128;&#153;s age distribution.&#13;
                                                                       Because both surveys are for similar periods and are based&#13;
     The National Family Health Survey 3 (NFHS-3)                      on representative national samples, the differences between&#13;
     Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s National Family Health Surveys are large, nationally      them in results represent sampling error.&#13;
     representative sample surveys covering various health,&#13;

     the Third National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) were             water. Not all of these estimates are for 2006. For example,&#13;
     conducted from December 2005 to August 2006. This survey          the latest available burden-of-disease estimates are for 2004.&#13;
     includes information on household characteristics including       This study uses death rates by age from the â&#128;&#156;Global Burden&#13;
     demography, health services use, sanitation, toilet type,         of Diseaseâ&#128;? study update for 2004 (WHO, 2008a). These&#13;
     water source, and disease episodes for selected diseases          rates are combined with 2006 population estimates by&#13;
     including diarrhea. The present study uses NFHS-3                 age to estimate the number of deaths from diseases caused&#13;
     information for household size, toilet type, water source and     by inadequate sanitation in 2006. This study uses WHO&#13;
     access, disease incidence and treatment, age distribution,        national-level disease-incidence estimates where available,&#13;
     weight-for-age categories and malnutrition indices, and time      but otherwise uses WHO regional estimates.&#13;

&#13;
Health                            â&#128;¢ Scientific evidence points to sanitation and hygiene being a key part of the causal pathways that lead to&#13;
                                    diseases included in this study.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ Diseases resulting from poor sanitation and hygiene lead to substantial premature loss of life, and the&#13;
                                    economic impacts from these are expected to be large.&#13;
&#13;
Water                             â&#128;¢ Water is polluted by the release of human excreta into it. This leads to costly avoidance behaviors and&#13;
                                    resulting coping costs. These need to be accounted for in a study of economic impacts.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ Households use various methods (filters, boiling, etc.) and purchase bottled water to avoid using water&#13;
                                    polluted by human excreta. These recourses cost money for households.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ Household members have to travel longer distances to fetch water from cleaner sources in preference to&#13;
                                    polluted water from a nearer source, leading to loss of time.&#13;
&#13;
Toilet access                     â&#128;¢ Poor sanitation results in poor health, absence from work or school, and restricted mobility, especially for&#13;
                                    women. These result in loss of education, social and economic opportunities, and incomes.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ People from households without toilets have to spend time going to open-defecation sites, or have to wait&#13;
                                    to use community or shared toilets more than they would if they had toilets at home.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ Inadequate toilet access leads to considerable losses of privacy, dignity, security, and convenience,&#13;
                                    especially for girls, women, children, the elderly, and the infirm.&#13;
&#13;
Tourism                           â&#128;¢ Tourism is an important sector for the Indian economy, contributing over $8 billion in annual foreign&#13;
                                    exchange earnings. Inadequate sanitation is likely to result in discouraging tourism and lowering potential&#13;
                                    tourist inflow.&#13;
&#13;
                                  â&#128;¢ Tourist illnesses may result in loss of welfare and money to tourists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This ESI India study also included an additional dimension:                               an insurer may be paying the medical cost for a patient, or&#13;
potential sanitation markets. The huge sanitation deficit in                              the government may be subsidizing healthcare.&#13;
India signals considerable potential for generating economic&#13;
activities to meet the future demand for sanitation and                                   Economic impact is a more generalized concept than&#13;
hygiene products and services.                                                            monetary impacts and includes imputed monetary values&#13;

&#13;

   Sometimes monetary impacts are also categorized as â&#128;&#156;financialâ&#128;? impacts; however modern financial accounting includes imputed values of non-monetary&#13;
assets and liabilities, therefore â&#128;&#156;monetaryâ&#128;?, and not â&#128;&#156;financialâ&#128;?, is the preferred term to indicate the costs being examined.&#13;

     various data sources to arrive at physical units for the                 was sought and assumptions were made based on that.&#13;
     indicators of the impact subcategories, such as incidence of&#13;
     diseases, number of households using a particular treatment              Considerable data processing was undertaken given the&#13;

     values were adjusted to calculate estimates for the year 2006.           varying levels of detail, and even, sometimes, varying definitions.&#13;
     The second step was to attribute a portion of these indicators           Some of the methodological highlights are presented below.&#13;
     to inadequate sanitation. These attributions were based on               (Detailed explanations about data sets, their processing, values&#13;

     For calculating the economic value of a human life, the human          average earnings of employees, the unemployment-adjusted&#13;
     capital approach was selected, although instead of using the           labor share of GDP per worker was used. (See Box 2.1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          BOx 2.1 VALUATION OF HUMAN LIFE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          While ascribing an economic value to the loss of life is fraught with problems, economic methods have been&#13;
          developed to impute values to different facets of life. Two common methods were considered for this study:&#13;
&#13;
          The Value of Statistical Life (VOSL) method: Studies based on the Value of Statistical Life approach implicitly&#13;
          or explicitly estimate what people are willing to pay for a reduction in chance of death, or what they are willing&#13;
          to accept for an increase in chance of death. Several â&#128;&#156;willingness to payâ&#128;? studies ask respondents directly about&#13;
          what they would be willing to pay for reduction in chances of death or disease.&#13;
&#13;
          The Human Capital Approach: The Human Capital Approach aims to capture loss of productive human&#13;
          capital, reflected in loss of output due to a premature death. This approach accounts for economic loss during the&#13;
          productive years by valuing lost output due to premature death. The usual approach is by estimating the present&#13;
          value of future earnings of employees. Earnings of employees are a market-determined price of labor, influenced&#13;
          by relative bargaining power in the factor markets. Market imperfections may distort market prices, and earnings&#13;
          of employees may not reflect the contribution of labor to output. Market distortions of prices have been cited&#13;
          as a reason for not using market prices in such cost benefit studies, and shadow prices or opportunity costs have&#13;
          been recommended instead (DrÃ¨ze and Stern, 1990). Labor share of output per worker captures the contribution&#13;
          of labor to output better than average compensation of employees. India lacks recent, large, representative,&#13;
          population-based VOSL studies for reduction in probability of death and disease. Using this method therefore&#13;
          would necessitate transferring VOSL values from OECD countries, but this was deemed inappropriate.&#13;
&#13;
          The Human Capital Approach was deemed suitable for the studyâ&#128;&#148;except that instead of using average earnings&#13;
          of employees, the unemployment-adjusted labor share of GDP per worker was used. This was calculated to be&#13;
          `50,589 ($1,119) (`37,442 or $828 for rural and `84,918 or $1,878 for urban workers). These values are used to&#13;
          estimate the present value of the lost future labor share of output per worker, using a real annual growth rate of&#13;
          labor share of output per worker of 0.02 (2 percent), annual discount rate of future income of 0.03 (3 percent),&#13;
          and a working life from ages 15 to 65. Thus the present value of the expected lifetime contribution to output by&#13;
          children below age five was `1.75 million ($38,706), `1.91 million ($42,172) for persons between ages 5 and&#13;
          14, and `1.24 million ($27,347) for persons above age 15.&#13;

     As is clear from the foregoing account, the base values of             A number of meta-analyses have been conducted to document&#13;
     indicators, their valuations, and assumptions (wherever they           the health impacts of different types of interventions in&#13;
     have been made) have all tended to be very conservative.               improving access to sanitation facilities, hygiene practices, and&#13;
     Therefore, if anything, the estimates made by the current              water quantity and quality (World Bank, 2008a). Since most&#13;
     estimates are on the low sideâ&#128;&#148;the actual value of impacts is           of them have focused on reducing the incidence of diarrhea&#13;
     probably much higher.                                                  among infants, this analysis has attempted to answer the&#13;
                                                                            question: What are the impacts, in terms of reducing relative&#13;
     Differential impacts on the poor                                       risk, of the various sanitation options and interventions?&#13;
     The availability of data across different socioeconomic classes&#13;
     is limited to the NFHS-3, which surveyed the asset ownership           Based on a review of those meta-analyses, the interventions&#13;
     of households and based on which a wealth-index was created            have been classified into five types:&#13;
     that divides all households into five wealth quintiles, each with&#13;
     about 20 percent of households ranked according to their                   1.   Improved toilet access and use&#13;
     wealth. NFHS-3 data also identifies whether a household is                 2.   Improved hygiene behaviour (including toilet use)&#13;
     urban or rural, but the wealth quintiles are identified only               3.   Improved access to adequate quantity of water&#13;
     at the national level and not within rural and urban areas.                4.   Improved access to safe quality water, and&#13;
     Therefore, a quintile labelled â&#128;&#156;WQ1 Rural,â&#128;? for example,                   5.   Safe confinement and disposal of fecal matter&#13;
     stands for households in the poorest national wealth quintile                   (septage/sewage treatment).&#13;
     that are also located in rural areas (and not the poorest quintile&#13;
     of rural households).                                                  The estimates of these intervention activities were applied to&#13;
                                                                            health impacts in order to estimate potential gains from each&#13;
     Limited data exists on morbidity patterns, so only the costs of        category. However, it should be noted that these are based on&#13;
     health treatment have been computed in the wealth analysis.            meta-studies and, therefore, it is difficult to neatly separate&#13;
     Mortality-by-disease is also unavailable for disaggregated             out the various categories or measure combined effects.&#13;
     wealth categories, so mortality estimates have also been&#13;
     excluded. Thus, the study results are underestimates of the            Sanitation markets&#13;
     relative economic impact on the poorer households, since               In order to quantify the increased economic activity (although&#13;
     poorer households are more likely to have deaths from                  not any additions to GDP), a simple model was constructed&#13;
     diseases caused by inadequate sanitation. This provides a              to estimate the national market for sanitation products&#13;
     limited picture of inequities, due to under-reporting and              and services in India from 2007 to 2020. Following the&#13;
     classification problems as well as other factors, like greater         governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy targets, it was assumed that all households&#13;

     Gains from sanitation                                                  unimproved open-pit toilets will be converted to improved&#13;
     Economic gains from sanitation are somewhat like the                   toilet types by 2012. The role of community toilets was also&#13;
     reverse side of the economic costs of inadequate sanitation,           assumed to be enhanced in order to provide access to toilet&#13;
     comprising what can be saved by avoiding losses in health              facilities over the next few years, and that this role would then&#13;

     HEALTH IMPACTS&#13;
     The most important causes of morbidity and mortality that             Malnutrition induced by sanitation-related diseases is&#13;
     can be attributed to inadequate sanitation are diarrhea and           attributed to an annual 21.8 million cases of ALRI among&#13;
     acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). About 88 percent of         children below age five. This burden among children under&#13;
     diarrhea is attributed to inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene,        five is disproportionately shared by the rural population,&#13;
     and unsafe water supply. ALRI causes malnutrition, which in           which accounts for 81 percent of that age groupâ&#128;&#153;s ALRI&#13;
     turn causes diseases and deaths, especially among children.           cases attributable to inadequate sanitation and 76 percent its&#13;
     Only half of the diarrhea and ALRI cases in children are              diarrhea cases. The incidence of diarrhea and ALRI attributable&#13;

     ACCESS TIME IMPACTS                                                 It is estimated in this study that an extra 78.6 billion hours&#13;
     Economic costs of accessing open-defecation                         were spent accessing open-defecation sites and shared toilets&#13;
     areas and shared toilets                                            in 2006. This estimate is based on a single visit to a toilet per&#13;
     Not having access to good toilets results in a loss of time,        person per day, using 20 extra minutes per person per day to&#13;
     comfort, convenience, security, dignity, and status, and it         access open-defecation sites in rural areas and 15 minutes in&#13;
     may also lead to conflicts within a community. These losses         urban areas, and using 5 extra minutes to access shared toilets&#13;
     are felt more heavily by women and girls. A partial economic        in both rural and urban areas. The economic cost of this lost&#13;
     equivalent of this loss of welfare and ability to exercise          access time is estimated at `477.5 billion ($10.5 billion).&#13;
     preferences by persons who are forced to defecate in the open       Since open defecation is more prevalent in rural areas, the&#13;
     or to share toilets, has been estimated in this study. Estimates    time-cost of open defecation makes up 98 percent of the&#13;
     are based on a valuation of extra time that people use to access    costs of access time in rural areas. Time lost for use of shared&#13;
     open-defecation sites and shared toilets. This economic loss        toilets makes up a much higher proportion of lost access&#13;
     is a conservative estimate, because it does not include many        time in urban areas (33 percent). This reflects the fact that&#13;
     intangible aspects and welfare losses unrelated to loss of time,    shared toilets were used by 24.6 percent of urban residents&#13;
     like embarrassment or convenience.                                  and only 5.7 percent for rural residents. Rural residents bear&#13;

     An estimated 629 million persons (56 percent of population)         the countryâ&#128;&#153;s total time costs for accessing open-defecation&#13;
     defecated in the open in 2006: this number comprises 575            sites, whereas for the time costs of accessing shared toilets,&#13;
     million (72 percent) rural residents and 54 million (17             urban residents bear 81 percent of the burden (`31.6 billion,&#13;
     percent) urban residents. An additional 125 million persons         $697 million).&#13;
     (11 percent) used shared toilets, 45 million of them rural&#13;
     residents and 80 million urban. Thus, 754 million people,           Economic costs at schools and workplaces&#13;
     including 621 million in rural and 134 million in urban areas,      This study also estimated losses from inadequate sanitation&#13;

Economic impact includes monetary impacts (that is, someone         as a loss of 6.4 percent of GDP during 2006. The discounted&#13;
paying out or losing money), as well as non-monetary impacts        present value of loss of economic flows that may occur after&#13;
on which monetary values are imputed for valuation (e.g., that      2006 due to deaths in 2006 is about 54 percent of the total&#13;
of time lost due to walking to an open-defecation location).        economic impacts, equivalent to 3.4 percent of GDP. Thus,&#13;
This analysis shows that monetary losses, a subset of economic      the actual loss of flow of 2006 economic value is the remaining&#13;
losses, are estimated to be `364 billion ($8 billion) in 2006,      46 percent, equivalent to about 3.0 percent of GDP. Table 3.10&#13;
as presented in Table 3.9.                                          presents the composition of economic impacts by monetary&#13;

The costs of treating illnesses dominate the monetary losses        that are also accounted for in the year 2006.&#13;
(58 percent of the total), followed by lost productivity due&#13;
to illnesses, treating water, and accessing piped water. In         Per capita impacts&#13;

of the GDP, or `326 ($7) per person.                                also show up as significant, as Figure 3.17 shows. The per capita&#13;
                                                                    losses are estimated to be `2,180 ($48.10)â&#128;&#148;consisting of&#13;

It may be noted that while the economic impacts of inadequate       related to water, `436 ($9.61) related to access time, and `11&#13;

are losses of economic value that were created in 2006. For         due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
example, deaths that occurred in 2006 resulted in a loss of&#13;
human capital in 2006 that would have generated economic            Per capita monetary loss&#13;
flows in 2006 and beyond. Therefore, loss of human capital          The per capita monetary losses are `326 ($7), three-fourths&#13;
in 2006 also reflects economic losses of future flows of value,     of which are health-related and one-fifth of which are water-&#13;
in addition to the flow of value in 2006. The discounted            related. Table 3.11 shows that an equivalent of 0.96 percent&#13;
present value of these future losses is counted in the 2006         of the GDP (or GDP per person) is lost as monetary losses&#13;
total. Thus, an economic impact of inadequate sanitation            due to inadequate sanitation and hygiene.&#13;

The estimates of economic impact presented above are based            percent of the unemployment adjusted labor share of GDP&#13;
on some numbers that could have been selected differently.            per worker is used for the valuation of time for adults and&#13;
Whenever a choice of numbers was available, this study                children instead of the much lower percentages used in the&#13;

in addition to the â&#128;&#156;baseâ&#128;? estimates presented so far, it is also&#13;
instructive to look at a rangeâ&#128;&#148;a low and a high estimateâ&#128;&#148;of           The low case uses a different method for valuation of&#13;

or 18.1 percent of GDP. The higher estimate is greatly                evident that results are sensitive to valuation methods for&#13;

       While the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) at present assumes construction of toilets with on-site safe collection and treatment only, limited resources are made available&#13;
     for solid and liquid waste management in rural areas. In larger rural centers, this is also likely to take the form of some sort of small-scale organized treatment mechanism&#13;
     before moving to conventional systems like those available in urban areas.&#13;

ESTIMATION OF SANITATION MARKET SIZE                                      Over time, the annual infrastructure expenditure is expected&#13;
The national cumulative sanitation market has the potential               to rise from `223 billion in 2007 to `391 billion in 2020,&#13;
to grow to `6.87 trillion ($152 billion) for the period of 2007           and operation and maintenance expenditures are expected&#13;
to 2020, of which `4.4 trillion (64 percent) is projected to              to rise from `77 billion in 2007 to `292 billion over the&#13;
be in infrastructure and another `2.5 trillion (36 percent)               same period.&#13;
in operation and maintenance services. In rural areas during&#13;
this period the market has a potential of `3.77 trillion                  The annual rural sanitation market has the potential to more&#13;
($83 billion) and in urban areas a potential of `3.1 trillion             than double from 2007 to 2020, from `162 billion ($3.6&#13;
($69 billion).                                                            billion) to `369 billion ($8.1 billion). The annual urban&#13;

Figure 4.4 indicates that the estimated annual market size                `138 billion ($3.0 billion) to `314 billion ($6.9 billion), in&#13;
for sanitation products and services ranges from `300 billion             the same period. The key indicators of the potential market&#13;
($6.6 billion) in 2007 to `683 billion ($15.1 billion) in 2020.           and its components are summarized in Table 4.1.&#13;

     Diarrhea                              88% of diarrhea is attributed to unsafe water supply, inadequate sanitation, and hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Improved water supply reduces diarrhea morbidity by 6% to 25%, if severe outcomes are included.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Improved sanitation reduces diarrhea morbidity by 32%.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Hygiene interventions including hygiene education and promotion of hand washing can lead to a&#13;
                                           reduction of diarrhea cases by up to 45%.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Improvements in drinking water quality through household water treatment, such as chlorination at&#13;
                                           point of use, can lead to a reduction of diarrhea episodes by 35% and 39%.&#13;

     HIV/AIDS                              With inadequate sanitation and hygiene people afflicted with HIV/AIDS become more susceptible&#13;
                                           to opportunistic infections. As a result, their health and quality of life suffers. Good sanitation and&#13;
                                           hygiene are important for maintaining health, productivity, and quality of life of people living with&#13;
                                           HIV/AIDS.&#13;

     Schistosomiasis                       An estimated 160 million people are infected with schistosomiasis. It is strongly related to&#13;
                                           unsanitary excreta disposal and absence of nearby sources of safe water. Basic sanitation reduces&#13;
                                           the disease by up to 77%.&#13;

&#13;
     Campylobacteriosis                    Campylobacteriosis is a severe form of diarrhea that occurs worldwide. Sanitation and personal&#13;
                                           and food hygiene as well as safe water supply are important in its prevention.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Campylobacteriosis is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of the infection&#13;
                                           include diarrhea (often including the presence of mucus and blood), abdominal pain, malaise, fever,&#13;
                                           nausea, and vomiting. Death from campylobacteriosis is rare and is more likely in the very young,&#13;

Disease/health impairment                    information about disease/health impairment&#13;
&#13;
Cholera                                      Cholera is an acute infection of the intestine, which begins suddenly with painless watery&#13;
                                             diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Most people who become infected have very mild diarrhea or&#13;
                                             symptom-free infection. Malnourished people in particular experience more severe symptoms.&#13;
                                             Severe cholera cases present with profuse diarrhea and vomiting. Severe, untreated cholera can&#13;
                                             lead to rapid dehydration and death. If untreated, 50% of people with severe cholera will die, but&#13;
                                             prompt and adequate treatment reduces this to less than 1% of cases.&#13;
&#13;
Hepatitis                                    Hepatitis, a broad term for inflammation of the liver, has a number of infectious and non-infectious&#13;
                                             causes. Two of the viruses that cause hepatitis (hepatitis A and E) can be transmitted through water&#13;
                                             and food; hygiene is therefore important in their control.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Among the infectious causes, hepatitis A and hepatitis E are associated with inadequate water&#13;
                                             supplies and poor sanitation and hygiene, leading to infection and inflammation of the liver.&#13;
                                             The illness starts with an abrupt onset of fever, body weakness, loss of appetite, nausea,&#13;
                                             and abdominal discomfort, followed by jaundice within a few days. The disease may range from&#13;
                                             mild (lasting 1-2 weeks) to severe disabling disease (lasting several months). In areas highly&#13;
                                             endemic for hepatitis A, most infections occur during early childhood. The majority of cases may&#13;
                                             not show any symptoms; fatal cases due to fulminant acute hepatitis are rare. Nearly all patients&#13;
                                             recover completely with no long-term effects.&#13;

Leptospirosis                                Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects both humans and animals. The early stages&#13;
                                             of the disease may include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, chills, redness in the eyes,&#13;
                                             abdominal pain, jaundice, hemorrhages in skin and mucous membranes (including pulmonary&#13;
                                             bleeding), vomiting, diarrhea, and a rash.&#13;
&#13;
                                             Pathogenic Leptospira spp. cause leptospirosis. Human infection occurs through direct contact&#13;
                                             with the urine of infected animals or by contact with a urine-contaminated environment, such as&#13;
                                             surface water, soil, and plants. Leptospires can gain entry through cuts and abrasions in the skin&#13;
                                             and through mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Human-to-human transmission&#13;
                                             occurs only rarely.&#13;
&#13;
Malnutrition                                 Malnutrition is a major health problem, especially in developing countries. Water supply, sanitation,&#13;
                                             and hygiene, given their direct impact on infectious diseases, especially diarrhea and intestinal&#13;
                                             worms, are important for preventing malnutrition. Both malnutrition and inadequate water&#13;
                                             supply and sanitation are linked to poverty. The impact of repeated or persistent diarrhea on&#13;
                                             nutrition-related poverty and the effect of malnutrition on susceptibility to infectious diarrhea&#13;
                                             are reinforcing elements of the same vicious circle, especially amongst children in&#13;
                                             developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Spinal injury                                Deformities of the spine may also occur when water has to be fetched and carried long distances&#13;
                                             over a considerable period of time.&#13;
&#13;
Trachoma                                     Trachoma is an infection of the eyes that may result in blindness after repeated re-infections. It is&#13;
                                             the worldâ&#128;&#153;s leading cause of preventable blindness and occurs where people live in overcrowded&#13;
                                             conditions with limited access to water and healthcare. Trachoma spreads easily from person to&#13;
                                             person and is frequently passed from child to child and from child to mother within the family.&#13;
                                             Infection usually first occurs in childhood but people do not become blind until adulthood.&#13;
                                             The disease progresses over years as repeated infections cause scarring on the inside of the&#13;
                                             eyelid, earning it the name of the â&#128;&#156;quiet disease.â&#128;? The eyelashes eventually turn in. This causes&#13;
                                             rubbing on the cornea at the front of the eye. The cornea becomes scarred leading to severe vision&#13;
                                             loss and eventually blindness.&#13;
&#13;
Typhoid and paratyphoid                      Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are infections caused by bacteria which are transmitted from&#13;
enteric fevers                               feces to ingestion. Clean water, hygiene, and good sanitation prevent the spread of typhoid and&#13;
                                             paratyphoid. Contaminated water is one of the pathways of transmission of the disease.&#13;

Sanitation Attributable Fraction of 88 percent was applied to                            malnutrition, and the impact of malnutrition on relative&#13;

Total treatment cost for these episodes was estimated using                                   valuation was taken to be 30 percent of the full value, and&#13;

                        Economics of Sanitation&#13;
                        The Economics of Sanitation Initiative was launched in 2007 as a response by the Water and&#13;
                        Sanitation Program (www.wsp.org) to address major gaps in evidence among developing countries&#13;
                        on the economic aspects of sanitation. The study aims to provide evidence that supports sanitation&#13;
                        advocacy, elevates the profile of sanitation, and acts as an effective tool to convince governments&#13;
                        to take action.&#13;
                        The first study completed in Southeast Asia found that the economic costs of poor sanitation and&#13;
                        hygiene amounted to over US$9.2 billion a year (2005 prices) in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR,&#13;
                        the Philippines, and Vietnam. Its second phase analyzes the cost-benefit of alternative sanitation&#13;
                        interventions and will enable stakeholders to make decisions on how to spend funds allocated to&#13;
                        sanitation more efficiently.&#13;
                        Due to the studyâ&#128;&#153;s successful traction, WSP carried out ESI studies in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.&#13;
                        ESI studies are also planned for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&#13;

            Economic impacts of inadequate sanitation
            in India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            has launched a multi country Economics of Sanitation
            Initiative (ESI) to study the economic impacts of poor
            sanitation and the costs and benefits of improved sanitation
            options. The overall goal of ESI is to provide decision
            makers at the country and regional levels with the evidence
            they need to advocate for increased investment in improving
            sanitation and to provide an improved evidence-base for
            efficient planning and implementation of sustainable
            sanitation and hygiene options and programs. The
            inter-related objectives of the ESI India Study are to:
            carry out an impact study to generate evidence on the
            economic impacts of current sanitation arrangements and
            hygiene practices in relation to the management of human
            excreta, in both the rural and urban areas of India, based
            on an analysis of secondary data; carry out an options study
            to collect and analyze data on the actual costs and benefits
            of different sanitation options or interventions in a range
            of program delivery contexts. The ESI impact study is highly
            relevant to the sanitation challenges that the people of
            India face today in both rural and urban areas of the country.
