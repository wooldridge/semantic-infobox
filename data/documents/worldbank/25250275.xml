agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with the purposes of this&#13;

Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors have decided&#13;
to make available under the Administration Arrangements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
7.2    The Bank will calculate a fee each time funds (the "Grant Amount") from the Trust Fund become&#13;
committed under a Grant Agreement. Such commitment will occur when such Grant Agreement is fully&#13;
countersigned (the "Calculation Date"). The fee so calculated by the Bank will be based on the cumulative&#13;
total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant Agreements that have been fully countersigned&#13;
on or prior to the Calculation Date (the "Cumulative Grant Total"). The calculated fee will depend on where&#13;
the Cumulative Grant Total stands as the Grant Amount is added and will be determined in accordance with&#13;

(i)    5% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total below or&#13;
equal to US$50 million; plus&#13;

million and below or equal to US$500 million; plus&#13;

million and below or equal to US$1 billion; plus&#13;
(iv)   2% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total above US$1&#13;
billion.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Following each Calculation Date, the Bank will deduct from the Trust Fund, and retain for its own account,&#13;
the fee as set forth above. Grant Amounts may not exceed the balance of uncommitted funds in the Trust Fund&#13;
net of the related fee.&#13;
7.3    The Bank will be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be invited&#13;
by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.4    The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms of any Grant&#13;
Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any Grant Agreements. To&#13;
the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the Donors the opportunity to exchange views before effecting any&#13;
