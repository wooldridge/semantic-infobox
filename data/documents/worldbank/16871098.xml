The crucial challenges associated with                decisions for sustainable and equitable&#13;
structural changes in the private sector,             development in Tanzania.&#13;
such as the emergence of small informal&#13;

&#13;
                             The ongoing energy crisis has contributed to the slowdown in economic&#13;
                             growth. The economy suffered frequent fuel shortages in the second semester of 2011,&#13;
                             as reï¬&#130;ected by the 22 percent decline in electricity output during the third quarter, even&#13;
                             though only 13 percent of the population has access to electricity. In August 2011, the&#13;
                             Government implemented an emergency program to rehabilitate and construct new&#13;
                             power supplies. This program has gradually helped resolve this problem. In January&#13;
                             2012, to support this program, electricity tariffs were increased by an average of 40&#13;
                             percent. This measure should help cover the costs of emergency power supply and&#13;
                             of longer term investments. In the shorter term, it will protect the public company&#13;

suffered frequent            Today, at USD 0.17 per kilowatt-hour, Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s average electricity tariff is still half&#13;
fuel shortages               of the tariff in Uganda and about 20 percent lower than that of Kenya. This indicates&#13;
in the second                that it is lack of access, and not high prices, that is the real problem for private sector&#13;

as reï¬&#130;ected by&#13;
the 22 percent               The second explanation for the slower rate of growth is the recent&#13;
decline in                   adjustment to unsustainable ï¬?scal and monetary policies. Public spending&#13;
electricity output           expansion will have to be more moderate than initial projections, lowering its impact on&#13;
                             the aggregate demand. The restrictive monetary policy has already pushed interest rates&#13;
                             up and reduced credit to the private sector. The recent slowdown in construction (down&#13;
                             by 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2011 compared to last year) and manufacturing&#13;
                             (down 0.7 percent) may reï¬&#130;ect higher energy and borrowing costs.&#13;
&#13;
                             6 Only 13.5 percent of Tanzanians have access to electricity with a high inequality depending on the household&#13;
                               income levels. While almost 3 out of four wealthy households report to be connected to the national grid,&#13;
                               the access rate is close to zero for the 80 percent poorest households in the country.&#13;

                               countries in 2012 is projected at 1.4 percent for 2012 including -0.3 percent in the Euro&#13;
                               Area. Developing country growth projections have been revised down from 6.2 to 5.4&#13;
                               percent in 2012. World trade is projected to grow at 4.7 percent in 2012 compared to 6.6&#13;

                            illustrated by the following numeral example.&#13;
                            Take ï¬?rst the group of 20 â&#128;&#156;underserved districtsâ&#128;?, where mean expenditure per 7-13 year&#13;
                            old was TSh82450 and the average pass rate was 53 percent in primary school leverâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                            exams in 2008/9. Then, compare this group with the sample of 20 relatively â&#128;&#156;overservedâ&#128;?&#13;
                            districts with average spending at TSh146000 and pass rates at 80 percent.&#13;
                            If resources, say TSh10 billion, are re-allocated from the second to the ï¬?rst group, the&#13;
                            net increase of passers will be as much as 3827 or over 200 percent gains for those 40&#13;
                            districts. This net increase accounts for the gain of 5606 in underserved districts and the&#13;
                            loss of 1779 in over served ones.&#13;
                            For larger sums the amount of gain would diminish but efï¬?ciency savings of around&#13;
                            TSh240bn per annum might be possible just from geographical re-allocation.&#13;

in the mid-2000s.19 In 2009, in&#13;
terms of value added per worker,&#13;
the level of productivity of the&#13;
Tanzanian agricultural sector was&#13;
only 4 percent of that of Malaysiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
agricultural sector. Productivity&#13;
was also signiï¬?cantly lower than&#13;
in Kenya, despite agricultural&#13;
endowment advantages.20&#13;
&#13;
However,          despite      these&#13;
discouraging ï¬?gures, there&#13;
are signs of incipient growth&#13;
in the Tanzanian economy. The&#13;
dramatic advances in technology,&#13;
indicated by the equally dramatic&#13;
expansion in the rate of usage&#13;
of mobile communications, and&#13;
improvements in education have&#13;
resulted in signiï¬?cant structural&#13;
transformation. While the results&#13;
of this transformation have not yet&#13;
been reï¬&#130;ected in national accounts,&#13;
they are likely to shape the future of&#13;
the Tanzanian economy.21&#13;

  How to get long lasting beneï¬?ts from foreign investors: The lesson from&#13;
  Asia&#13;
  Foreign ï¬?rms are mobile, and they may locate in a country on a temporary basis. This&#13;
  is especially true in textile, ICT or light manufacturing where ï¬?xed capital requirements&#13;
  are small and obsolete very quickly. The challenge for the host country is therefore to&#13;
  get long-term beneï¬?ts from possibly short term investments.&#13;
  The lesson from East Asia is straightforward: success lies in the number of locally&#13;
  trained workers because they are the countryâ&#128;&#153;s main asset. Not only training of local&#13;
  workers employed by the foreign company but also of those used by local suppliers&#13;
  and distributors. The good news with training is that it is also beneï¬?cial to investors&#13;
  since trained local staffs are generally more productive and cheaper than expatriates.&#13;
  Yet, there is a risk that training will be underused since ï¬?rms might be afraid to see&#13;

  resources on a long term gain.&#13;
  Malaysia offers an example where training was part of its central strategy. Not only this&#13;
  activity was explicit in every contracts negotiated with potential investors, including&#13;
  for public works, but also the Government took initiatives towards providing training,&#13;
  aimed at encouraging the role of the private sector and reducing the role of the&#13;
  government in training activities. The following initiatives were introduced:&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Promoting private sector participation in human resource planning through&#13;
  membership in institutions such as the National Vocational Training Council.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Promoting the role of the private sector in the provision of training through tax&#13;
  deduction on training expenses in approved institutions; the establishment of a Human&#13;
  Resource Development Fund (HRDF) with private sector steering imposing a levy of 1&#13;
  per cent of employeesâ&#128;&#153; wages which employers can partly reclaim for training budgets;&#13;
  as well as through a liberalization of regulation of private sector training.&#13;
  â&#128;¢ Promoting the sharing of public and private sector training resources, through&#13;
  exchange of trainers or allowing the use of public training facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The encouragement of skill and                          should be a top priority of Tanzanian&#13;
  technology transfers: In addition to                    policymakers, as these workers will&#13;
  providing ï¬?nancing, outside investors                   become an important part of the&#13;

  transfers. The Government should                        basis for ongoing, future growth (see&#13;
  establish the appropriate regulatory                    box). As the experience of the Asian&#13;
  and institutional framework to                          tigers demonstrates, every trained&#13;
  minimize possible conï¬&#130;icts of interests                 employee has the potential to serve&#13;
  and abuse of powers in sectors with                     as a teacher and/or entrepreneur. The&#13;
  quasi-natural monopoly structures                       appropriate transfer of skills through&#13;
  and to encourage skill and technology                   partnerships will result in a upgrading&#13;

            Tanzania economic update : stairways to heaven
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Tanzania's Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP) growth in the last 12 years has been extremely strong,
            averaging close to 7 percent annually. This rate is high,
            but still lower than that of successful emerging countries
            when the nation's high population growth rate of about
            3 percent is factored into the equation. Economic growth has
            failed to eradicate poverty, with one third of households
            still living below the poverty line. If Tanzania aims to
            reduce the income gap between itself and middle income
            countries, it will have to grow faster and better. This
            Tanzania economic update focuses on the need to transform
            the education system and to foster growth amongst business
            enterprises. These are the two vital elements by which
            Tanzania will achieve accelerated and shared growth. There
            is a synergistic effect between these two elements, since
            better educated people are more productive and therefore
            play a major role in making business enterprises become more
            competitive. The reverse is also true, since more
            competitive business enterprises can invest more in human
            capital. Those synergies are at the heart of economic development.
