            The water industry differs in two key
            respects from such other network industries as gas,
            electricity, and telecommunications. First, it offers fewer
            opportunities for competition among suppliers, since the
            network of pipes accounts for a large part of the total cost
            of water and can be run efficiently only as a monopoly.
            Second, the quality of water is crucial but hard for
            consumers to check. So, to get the best performance out of
            water companies, governments need to regulate the price and
            quality of water. To do that job well, regulators must know
            the appropriate price. The authors explain that the best way
            to discover this price is to auction the right to supply water.
