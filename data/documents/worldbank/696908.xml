REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIOUE&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR RECOVERY PROGRAM&#13;
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Mozambique.&#13;
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Health (MOH).&#13;
Beneflciaries:       Primarily women and children living in the rural areas, through increased&#13;
coverage and improved quality in the health system. Health staff, through the&#13;
implementation of the Health Manpower Development Plan and improved&#13;
working conditions.&#13;
Amount:              Program: US$ 355.7; IDA: SDR 66.3 million (US$ 98.7 million equivalent).&#13;
IDA Terms:          Standard with 40-year maturity.&#13;
Poverty Category:    Program of Targeted Interventions. The beneficiaries of the MOH's basic&#13;
health services are primarily women and children living in the rural areas of&#13;
the country. The Program is aimed at the reconstruction of the rural health&#13;
system, particularly in districts heavily affected by the war. Through the&#13;
(re)construction of health centers and health posts, the Rural Health&#13;
Development Fund of the Program aims to bring health services to the least&#13;
serviced areas of the country, which are also the poorest. The emphasis on&#13;
basic and preventive care, which underscores the National Health Strategy,&#13;
ensures that components aimed at improving pharmaceuticals and medical&#13;
supplies and health staff training will reach primarily the poor.&#13;
Program Objectives: The ultimate objective of the Mozambican National Health Strategy (MHS),&#13;
supported by this Program, is the improvement of the health status of the&#13;
population, in general, and a decrease in infant and child mortality, in&#13;
particular. MHS objectives are to be achieved through an increase in health&#13;
coverage of the population from the present 40 percent level to 60 percent by&#13;
the turn of the century, with better quality of services provided.&#13;
Program Description: Through the coordination of all major donors and the government, the&#13;
Program, which encompasses all activities of the MOH, will finance a&#13;
five-year time slice of the MHS. In accordance with the sector's strategy,&#13;
teams from the MOH have defined objectives and identified and prepared the&#13;
various components, under the overall coordination of the MOH's Planning&#13;
Directorate. The Program will address the following areas:&#13;
(a) resumption of and improvement in the guality of health services provided&#13;
so that the overall sector investment strategy yields a higher level of services,&#13;
as the sector expands, by: (i) rehabilitating and expanding the network of first&#13;
level health facilities; (ii) rehabilitating and expanding the network of rural&#13;
hospitals and rehabilitating the network of provincial and central hospitals; (iii)&#13;
strengthening laboratory facilities in hospitals and health centers; (iv) assuring&#13;
stability in the provision of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and laboratory&#13;
reagents; (v) supporting a national maintenance strategy in the sector; (vi)&#13;
supporting an institutional nutrition program for severely malnourished&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
children and for in-patients; and (vii) supporting general provincial operations&#13;
for health.&#13;
(b) improvement of sector institutions, suoport services and sub-national&#13;
health management systems by: (i) establishing policies and procedures and&#13;
expanding storage capacity aimed at improving the supply system for medical&#13;
supplies and pharmaceuticals; (ii) strengthening the provincial health&#13;
management system, in coordination with decentralization of functions to the&#13;
provinces; (iii) improving the sector's information system; and (iv) enabling&#13;
national implementation of the Program, including the development of sector&#13;
policy and systematic evaluations of the Program based on comprehensive&#13;
consultations with ultimate clients.&#13;
(c) development of human resources capacity, by: (i) implementing a&#13;
time-slice of the Health Manpower Development Plan; (ii) developing the&#13;
national capacity for health personnel training; (iii) promoting continuing&#13;
education of health workers; and (iv) enhancing university medical training.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:   The main benefits of the Program will be increased coverage and quality of&#13;
health services and increased equity in access to services with a shift of&#13;
resources toward rural areas and a basic package of health care. The main&#13;
beneficiaries of improved base facilities will be women and children through&#13;
MCH programs. The Program will also generate important external benefits&#13;
by assisting the MOH in the coordination and implementation of projects&#13;
undertaken by all donors. Finally, the Program will assist in increasing the&#13;
transparency and efficiency of the sector's budgetary process by moving&#13;
virtually all off-budget health expenditures into the budget. The main risk of&#13;
the Program is MOH's potential difficulty to implement fully parts of the&#13;
sector's extensive number of activities, leading to bottlenecks and inefficient&#13;
service provision. To mitigate this risk, the Program is designed to support&#13;
the improvement of management capacity in the MOH and aims to coordinate&#13;
and consolidate donors' activities so that implementation and capacity&#13;
constraints are substantially alleviated.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION: COUNTRY AND SECTOR OVERVIEW&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1    With a population of about 17 million, mostly rural and poor, subject to periodic drought and just&#13;
emerging from nearly two decades of internal warfare, Mozambique is generally regarded as one of the&#13;
world's greatest development challenges. Yet Mozambique has the potential to change from its present&#13;
situation. There are substantial prospects for economic development in the country if investment is&#13;
allowed to flow towards economic opportunity. The potential returns to increased investment in human&#13;
capital in Mozambique are enormous in terms of improvements in social welfare and as stimuli to&#13;
economic growth. The absolutely low starting point of Mozambique in terms of basic social indicators,&#13;
access to and quality of social services indicates that the "marginal dollar", wisely spent, can yield high&#13;
returns. Peacetime has made it possible for the government to reestablish effective communication with&#13;
the population in areas formerly cut off by the war and to collaborate with communities in the planning&#13;
and implementation of programs intended to help them to improve their lives.&#13;
1.2    In absolute terms and in comparison with other Sub-Saharan African experience, Mozambique's&#13;
social indicators are low, as shown in Table I which provides the most recent estimates available.&#13;

B. The Economic Environment&#13;
Macroeconomic Retrospective&#13;
1.3    Since Mozambique became independent from Portuguese rule in 1975 it has faced an extremely&#13;
difficult economic situation due to a combination of factors including economic mismanagement, natural&#13;
disasters and a civil war. Constant economic deterioration further depressed the already low living&#13;
standards of the people. In 1987, after an agreement with the IMF and the Bank, an Economic and Social&#13;
Rehabilitation Program (PRES) was launched. The program helped reverse the decline in GDP and&#13;
allowed a slight annual GDP growth of some 1.5 percent between 1987-91. Despite the increase in GDP,&#13;
urban poverty increased. The spread of the civil war and the resulting exodus of the population from&#13;
rural areas to the cities in search of a secure life, coupled with the decline of expenditures on human&#13;
resources and the withdrawal of the government's subsidies for staple foods, contributed to a deterioration&#13;
of the nutritional and health conditions of the overall population.&#13;

1.5    In 1993, with improved security, better weather, some partially restored infrastructure, and&#13;
continued structural reform, GDP growth reached 19 percent, and inflation fell from 55 percent in 1992&#13;
to 44 percent by year end. Agricultural production rose by 21 percent as the sector recovered from the&#13;
1992 drought and displaced households resettled in rural areas. Increased agricultural marketing and&#13;
improved security led to a sharp increase in commercial activities in rural areas. Traffic and passenger&#13;
flows were restored throughout the country and railroad traffic rose following repairs to the transport&#13;
corridors.  However, industrial production in the formal sector is stagnating because widespread&#13;
smuggling and effective negative protection have undermined the capacity of local firms to compete, while&#13;
exporters have no access to effective duty exemption regimes. An over-regulated business environment&#13;
and the slow pace of privatization of large industrial firms are also factors. Although the Mozambican&#13;
economy is expected to continue growing in 1994/95 at an annual rate of 5.8 percent, the macroeconomic&#13;
situation remains unstable due to high domestic inflation and rapid population growth.&#13;
Public Expenditures and Fiscal Stability&#13;
1.6    Although economic growth will increasingly come from private sector activity, at present nearly&#13;
fifty percent of GDP comes from government investment and consumption. Therefore, it is crucial that&#13;
public expenditures be transparent and reflect the priorities laid out by the government. The Triennial&#13;
Public Investment Program (PTIP) is the instrument used by government to account for and rationalize&#13;
medium-term investment decisions. Since its inception in 1992, the PTIP has been continuously improved&#13;
to better plan and control all investment activity outside the private sector (i.e., including donor support)&#13;
and to identify recurrent expenditures which are often built into investment projects. In parallel, off-&#13;
budget recurrent expenditures have gradually been integrated (or at least accounted for) in the budget.&#13;
Financing of the 1994-96 PTIP comes largely from donors, who contribute about 80 percent of the total.&#13;
Taxes and other internal revenues cover approximately 70 percent of the recurrent budget.'&#13;
1.7    To succeed, an integrated sector operation such as the Health Sector Recovery Program must be&#13;
implemented in a fiscally sustainable environment. What this means is not only that the Program should&#13;
be affordable by the government budget, but that the resulting budget should be consistent with the&#13;
restoration of macroeconomic stability, albeit in the context of long-term economic growth. While&#13;
significant progress has been achieved in reducing the fiscal deficit after grants, this has to date been done&#13;
mainly by increasing the mobilization of grants. To promote future fiscal sustainability and reduce aid&#13;
dependency, it is important to reduce the fiscal deficit before grants through increased revenues and&#13;
rationalization of investments. A key component of the government's program to raise revenues is the&#13;
reform of customs announced at the March 1995 Consultative Group Meeting, another important factor&#13;
is the introduction of a value-added tax over the medium-term. Rationalization of the investment program&#13;
is being achieved through the development of integrated sectoral investment programs that are consistent&#13;
with sectoral priorities and available future recurrent funding. Besides increased efficiency in the use of&#13;
external resources, the development of such programs should generate savings in technical assistance.&#13;
In total, the fiscal deficit before grants would fall from about 30 percent of GDP in 1994 to less than 15&#13;
percent by 1999. This level would be consistent with the expected reduction in Mozambique's aid&#13;
dependency over the medium to long-term and sustained economic growth.&#13;
'The last public expenditures review exercise for Mozambique took place in 1992. An updated review of social sectors&#13;
expenditures was carried out in 1994.&#13;

has put pressure on pubic expenditures for&#13;
education, health, and population programs. It has also reduced the capacity and incentives for private&#13;
households to spend on these measures.&#13;
1.9    Reduction in poverty and lasting improvement in the lives of Mozambicans will require a&#13;
substantial investment in the social sectors. In the period 1990-94, investment expenditures in the social&#13;
sectors averaged about 6 percent of the total investment budget, while the share of recurrent expenditures&#13;
amounted to less than 16 percent, on average, over the same period. The government realizes that these&#13;
levels are inadequate, and recent tangible reallocation of resources to health and education underscores&#13;
the priority now being afforded to poverty reduction and sustainable growth.&#13;
Health Sector Expenditures and Financing&#13;
1.10   Profile of Public Expenditures. In 1980, health sector expenditures accounted for about 6.7&#13;
percent of total public expenditures.2 For the next decade, expenditures declined sharply before stabilizing&#13;
at approximately 3 percent in 1990.3 During the period 1991-93 the health share of public expenditures&#13;
experienced a continuous increase from the level achieved in 1990 up to 4.2 percent (1993), with an&#13;
estimated sharp decrease in 1994. The graph below shows that the per capita health spending reached&#13;
the peak of US$ 4.67 in 1982, with a decline in the following two years even as GDP per capita&#13;
increased. This decline has never been recovered. Between 1980-94, expenditures on the health sector&#13;
as a share of GDP declined from about 2.5 percent to under 1.5 percent. Budget estimates for 1995 show&#13;
a sharp increase in health expenditures from the previous year and will likely reverse this long-term trend,&#13;
indicating the commitment of the newly elected government to human resources development in general&#13;
and to the health sector in particular.&#13;
2 Note that these estimates do not include the significant government spending on health activities by the military.&#13;

sector in GDP is higher in Mozambique than in most African countries).&#13;

1.11 Household Financing. The basis of a cost sharing scheme within the health sector was&#13;
established in 1977. However, it became relevant only since 1987, after adjustments in fees and&#13;
procedures. Cost sharing, excluding drugs, represented about 4.2 percent of government recurrent health&#13;
expenditures in 1987. Despite new revenues from fees charged at "special clinics" which were introduced&#13;
in 1990, the cost sharing ratio excluding drugs still declined to 3.1 percent in 1991. In 1990/91, cost&#13;
sharing on drugs was about 3 percent of total drug expenditures. During 199 1/1993 the cost sharing ratio&#13;
(including drugs and "special clinics") increased from 4.3 percent to 4.8 percent of the government&#13;
financed health expenditures. Cost recovery from regular outpatient and inpatient fees has decreased over&#13;
the same period, from 0.6 percent to 0.2 percent of the public expenditures, while that from the "special&#13;
clinics" has increased from 1 .4 percent up to 2.5 percent, partially due to the extension of such services&#13;
to the Beira Central Hospital. Considering only the Maputo Central Hospital, the amount collected by&#13;
"special clinics" increased five fold, at current prices, between 1991-93. During the same period the cost&#13;
sharing in drugs increased from 2.2 percent to 4.2 percent of the value of drugs distributed in the sector.&#13;
This increase resulted from a 50 percent adjustment of the exchange rate used to calculate the "official&#13;
price" of drugs dispensed by the health units; in mid-1994, it was estimated that the indirect subsidy to&#13;
the "official price" of drugs was more than 75 percent.&#13;
1 .12   External Financing. The MOH estimates that external aid for recurrent expenditures increased&#13;
from US$ 24.1 million in 1989 to US$ 32.9 million in 1991. It is also estimated that 41 percent of the&#13;
donor support was used for technical assistance (mainly doctors), 49 percent for drugs and other medical&#13;
supplies, and 10 percent for other operating costs. Almost all investments in the sector (90 percent of&#13;
total) have been covered by grants and credits.4 The investment component of donor support has been&#13;
4The MOH estimates often differ from donors' figures, for several reasons. Donor estimates may include implementing&#13;
overheads, preparation periods, program managers' salaries, and audits. Also, there are time lags between actual expenditures and&#13;
disbursements, in some cases of more than one year. In 1991, based on disbursement figures - recurrent and investment -&#13;
disbursements for the health sector as a share of total external financing for some major donors were as follows: Italy/ltalian&#13;

Box 2: 7he Evolvng MOH Policy on Cost Sharing&#13;
Following the IDA -financed study on cost sharing in the health sector (Recuperacao de Custos na Saude em&#13;
Mocambique), done in 1989/90, the MOH has taken some key policy decisions regarding the cost sharing&#13;
scheme, in view of the need to increase the ratio of cost sharing while effectively protecting the "vulnerable&#13;
groups" of the population. These policy decisions can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(i)    Drugs&#13;
*      Maintain an indirect subsidy on all drugs dispensed by the health units of the National Health System&#13;
(NHS). The proportion of this subsidy should decrease over time in order to gradually adjust the&#13;
"official price "to market prices, through adjustments to the artificial exchange rate used to calculate&#13;
the prices at which drugs are sold to consumers by the NHS.&#13;
*      Maintain a single fixed fee for drugs dispensed by the rural primary health care health facilities, as&#13;
well as free dispensing of drugs to inpatients at all NHS health facilities. In the medium term steps&#13;
should be taken to initiate cost sharing in drugs, medical supplies and auxiliary diagnostic materials&#13;
and procedures provided to inpatients.&#13;
(ii)    Outpatients and Inpatients&#13;
*      Differentiate fees according to the level of the health care unit providing the service and between&#13;
general and specialty outpatient consultations.&#13;
*      Introduce, in the central andprovincial hospitals, differentialfeesforinappropriate use of emergency&#13;
services by patients.&#13;
*      Differentiate inpatientfees according to the levels of health care units to inpatient lodging conditions.&#13;
(iii)   Preventive Services&#13;
v      All preventive activities (such as vaccinations), because of their positive externalities, will continue&#13;
to be free to the whole population.&#13;
Improvements in the organization and collection offees should be sought, as well as in the capacity to monitor&#13;
the effects of the userfees scheme (and any adjustments to it) on patients' access to and use of health services.&#13;
Due to the prevailing poverty of the majority of the population, in both rural and urban areas, revisions of&#13;
the definitions of "vulnerable groups' and of the types of services to be given free of charge or with subsidies&#13;
in their cost should be continuously undertaken.&#13;
The MOH has already started to take the steps necessary to implement the policy decisions referred to above.&#13;
It is expected that with the full implementation of those decisions the global recovery from user fees could&#13;
gradually reach between 10-15 percent of recurrent expenditures by the year 2000.&#13;
increasing, more than doubling its share of total aid to the sector from 17 percent in 1990 to 35 percent&#13;
Cooperation (15.3%); IDA (10.5%); DenmarkIDANIDA (9.7%); Norway/NORAD (9.5%); Switzerland/SDC (9%); UNICEF&#13;

in 1991. Efforts are being made by both government and donors to ensure strong coordination in support&#13;
of the global, geographic and sectoral priorities which have been established. This is the only way to&#13;
ensure a more equitable allocation, rationalizing and keeping track of public health expenditures and of&#13;
external funding. The existence of a large number of separate projects in the sector (122 in 1994) is&#13;
recognized by government and donors to weaken the already-fragile managerial capacity in the sector, and&#13;
the need for parallel administrations directed by donors does not facilitate institutional development within&#13;
the sector. The basis of this coordination reflects a desire at the highest levels of the MOH, best&#13;
expressed by the former Minister of Health Leonardo Simao, "to move away from a Ministry of Health&#13;
Projects and towards a Ministry of Health Services", avoiding individual projects and duplication of&#13;
services as well as contradictory and often inequitable policies, decisions and activities.&#13;
Program Affordability&#13;
1.13   Despite the significant expansion in services expected to be achieved through the Health Sector&#13;
Recovery Program, recurrent costs induced by investment in health facilities are expected to rise by less&#13;
than 2 percent per year.  The reason for this low  increase is that much of the health facilities&#13;
infrastructure work in the sector is either rehabilitation or upgrading of existing structures. The overall&#13;
number of health personnel is expected to remain effectively at the present level, i.e., fluctuating less than&#13;
5 percent during the Program life (paras. 1.47, 1.48). Moreover, a significant share of civil works (e.g.,&#13;
construction of warehouses) is likely to yield net savings of recurrent resources. The financing of&#13;
incremental recurrent costs directly linked to infrastructure expansion/upgrading will be covered by&#13;
increases in the sector budget, while costs linked to improvements in the quality of services will be mostly&#13;
built into the overall cost of the Program and largely financed by donors on a declining basis over time&#13;
(e.g., maintenance, supervision activities, transportation, etc.). An increasing share of cost recovery will&#13;
help ensure long term stability of local resources.&#13;
1.14   The annual increase in the sector's recurrent expenditures to be financed by the GOM is estimated&#13;
at 4 percent between 1996 and 2000, compounded on a sharp initial increase of about 40 percent for 1995.&#13;
This figure translates into an increase in recurrent public spending from about US$ 0.80 per capita in&#13;
1995 to about US$ 1.10 per capita by the year 2000. Despite an estimated modest growth in overall&#13;
recurrent public expenditures between now and the end of the century (averaging less than 2 percent p.a.),&#13;
the share of health in the overall recurrent budget will increase only slightly from about 6.2 percent in&#13;
1995 to 6.9 percent in 200o5. The health sector investment budget is also anticipated to grow at 4 percent&#13;
p.a. during the life of the Program compared to 3 percent for the overall investment budget. (paras. 2.58&#13;
and 5.2)&#13;

C. Sector Issues, Policy and Strategy (1996-2005)6&#13;
1 .15   The health sector situation is conditioned by: (a) absolute poverty of most of the population, with&#13;
the resulting low and declining living standards; (b) better access to and greater use of health care by the&#13;
urban population compared to the rural population; (c) limited government funding of the social sectors&#13;
for more than a decade; (d) worsening income distribution among the various social groups; and (e) due&#13;
to the end of the war, increased political pressure to rebuild the health care network in rural areas.&#13;
Main Health Problems&#13;
1.16   Mozambique has a typical pre-transitional epidemiological pattern. Infant mortality rate stands at&#13;
about 162 per thousand and child mortality rate at 282. Total fertility rate is 6.5 with no indications of&#13;
change. As in most sub-saharan countries, the main health problems in Mozambique are infectious and&#13;
parasitic diseases, particularly diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, measles, tuberculosis, malaria,&#13;
pneumonia and child malnutrition. Among adults the principal cause of morbidity is malaria, while&#13;
tuberculosis is the main reason for hospitalization and in patient mortality. Recently available facility-&#13;
based data indicate that the spread of HIV infection is still limited but rapidly on the increase.&#13;
1.17   Malnutrition is frequently a major compounding factor in morbidity and mortality, especially for&#13;
children. Data from spot surveys indicate that chronic malnutrition among children as measured by&#13;
stunting (height-for-age) is present in 30-40 percent of those surveyed, while acute malnutrition, measured&#13;
by wasting (weight-for-height) is present in about 6 percent of children. It is generally accepted that there&#13;
have not been any significant improvements in nutritional conditions in the rural areas despite peace.&#13;
There is some evidence that malnutrition has increased during the last few years, and most of the&#13;
population have food reserves for less than four months, with almost 60 percent of the population having&#13;
no food reserves.' Both chronic and acute nutritional problems directly aggravate the other health&#13;
problems of the population.&#13;
Health Sector Principles and Objectives&#13;
1.18   Mozambique inherited a health system located mostly in the urban areas (except for some scattered&#13;
health units run by religious organizations) and providing almost exclusively curative care. One month&#13;
after independence the government nationalized the health sector and prohibited the private practice of&#13;
medicine, intending to make all medical resources available to every citizen. As a result, the bulk of&#13;
modern health care is provided through the National Health Service, which is based on the following&#13;
mandates: (a) extend the health network and the benefits of the National Health Service throughout the&#13;
country, giving priority to preventive medicine; (b) develop a national curative care program both in the&#13;
urban and the rural areas, with priority to primary health care units; and (c) define and implement&#13;
adequate strategies aimed at fighting major endemic diseases.&#13;
6 The MOH document: Public Health Sector in Mozambique: A Post-War StrategyforRehabilitation andSustainedDevelopment&#13;
(1992) outlines the strategy for the sector. Five other MOH documents provide background for the strategy: (i) Revisdo da Politica&#13;

1.19   Through a series of policy adjustments which began in 1991, the following principles have been&#13;
affirmed as the basis for the National Health Policy: (a) maximizing the benefits from the use of available&#13;
resources; (b) fairness in distributing resources and equity in the access to health care across regions and&#13;
social groups; (c) freedom of users to choose their health care providers; (d) co-existence of public and&#13;
private sector; and (e) preservation of the basis and positive experiences gained through the National&#13;
Health Service in areas such as primary health care and essential drugs.&#13;
1.20   Within this framework, the objectives set for the health sector and re-stated in the Letter of Sector&#13;
Policy (Annex-1.2A) are:&#13;
(i)    to reduce mortality, morbidity and suffering, especially among high risk groups such as&#13;
women, children and all those displaced due to the war and natural disasters;&#13;
(ii)   to keep primary health care as the basis for the provision of good quality and sustainable&#13;
health care and make it accessible to the majority of the population;&#13;
(iii)   to develop the technical and managerial capacity of the MOH for planning, implementing&#13;
and evaluating health care and support services.&#13;
Health Services Delivery&#13;

and preventive out-patient services are provided in an integrated way: when a mother arrives with her sick&#13;
child at a clinic, the mother hears the daily health education talk, the child is treated, child and mother&#13;
receive needed vaccinations, and the mother receives family planning services or her pregnancy is&#13;
checked. This integrated approach minimizes the chance of missed opportunities for preventive services.&#13;
The health center also provides obstetric care for uncomplicated deliveries.  The second level is&#13;
constituted by rural hospitals (in the rural areas) and general hospitals (in towns). These hospitals play&#13;
a crucial role in the health care delivery system, because they can both offer some specialized health care&#13;
and also provide technical and organizational support to peripheral primary health care units. The third&#13;
level is composed of provincial hospitals with basic specialties (internal medicine, general surgery,&#13;
pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology). Finally, the fourth level is made up of central and specialized&#13;
hospitals providing the highest level of referral for curative care in the country.&#13;
1.22   The priority given to first level health care, to provide a basic package of preventive, promotive&#13;
and curative health services, was clearly demonstrated by the rapid growth in the numbers of Health&#13;
Centers (from 120 in 1975 to 223 in 1982) and Health Posts (from 326 in 1975 to 1,195 in 1985). The&#13;
number of hospitals did not change. An Essential Drugs Program, launched in 1986 within the National&#13;
Drug Policy Framework, aimned at covering the most basic needs at the first level of health care.&#13;
1.23   Basic Package of Health Services. The basic package of services which the MOH is attempting&#13;
to provide to the majority of the population, although it is not formally defined as a 'package", includes&#13;
8The Mozambican Health System was one of the leading examples for the World Health Organization when it adopted Primary&#13;
Health Care as the strategy to achieve its goal Health for All by the year 2000 in the famous conference of Alma Ata in 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
essential curative services (e.g., care for malaria, diarrhea with dehydration, acute respiratory infections,&#13;
moderate and severe malnutrition, trauma and delivery and postpartum care), preventive and health&#13;
promotion activities (e.g., immunization, antenatal care, health and sanitation education, nutritional&#13;
monitoring, family planning), and appropriate referral services.  MCH  services are offered in an&#13;
integrated way to minimize missed opportunities.&#13;
1.24   Health Network Rehabilitation and Development. Based on the objectives listed above, the&#13;
Health Sector Recovery Program mandates giving high priority to preventive medicine, but without&#13;
neglecting the role of curative services in delivering integrated health care to the population. Primary&#13;
health care is to continue to be the basis of the public health care delivery system, and its coverage is to&#13;
be expanded in the rural areas. Promoting and protecting the health of high risk populations and&#13;
preventing and controlling transmissible diseases continue to be priority objectives.  Similarly, the&#13;
assurance of timely referral of patients to higher tiers of the health care system constitutes an important&#13;
concern. Finally, improved management, efficiency and quality of health units, better equipment and&#13;
infrastructure maintenance, and gradual improvement of clinical technologies (including diagnostic&#13;
facilities) up to regional standards are also priorities.&#13;
1.25   In infrastructure rehabilitation/reconstruction, priority is to be given to the primary level of care.&#13;
However, rural secondary care has always been weak in Mozambique and attention also will be given to&#13;
upgrading and expanding the rural hospital network. In particular, all rural hospitals must become&#13;
capable of offering emergency surgical and obstetric services. The upgrading of rural health services will&#13;
be a contribution of the health sector to restoration of normal life in the countryside. Some resources will&#13;
also be dedicated to upgrading health services in the peri-urban areas which have become swollen with&#13;
rural migrants, not all of whom will return to the countryside. In the rehabilitation process, therefore,&#13;
first priority will be given to rural primary level facilities and rural hospitals, and, where appropriate, to&#13;
primary level facilities in peri-urban areas.&#13;
1.26   An important element of the rehabilitation strategy is to continue to redress the imbalances&#13;
inherited from colonial rule. To achieve this, in the rural areas hospitals need to be rehabilitated or&#13;
extended and some existing health centers upgraded to rural hospitals, construction of Polyvalent Village&#13;
Health Workers (APES)-staffed community health posts in villages will be promoted, and efforts will be&#13;
made to gradually introduce preventive activities in all health posts. In the urban areas, the primary&#13;
health care network should be extended through health centers with maternity services, but only where&#13;
justifiable by population increases.  In the larger cities (Maputo, Beira, Nampula and Nacala),&#13;
construction or extension of general hospitals should be foreseen as a solution to relieve pressure on&#13;
central hospitals, thus allowing for improved service delivery and for lower-cost inpatient and outpatient&#13;
services.&#13;
1.27   Rural/General Hospitals: The existing Rural Hospital network (24 Rural Hospitals) should be&#13;
rehabilitated by the year 2005, and another 15 Rural Hospitals should be introduced in the system. Most&#13;
of the new proposed Rural Hospitals (RHs) should result from the conversion and expansion of existing&#13;
Health Centers (HCs). Criteria for the selection of such facilities include population size and density,&#13;
availability of roads, and the economic importance of the district. Nationally, the planned increase will&#13;
provide one rural hospital per 475,000 inhabitants (as opposed to one per 61 1,000 now), with improved&#13;
equity in their distribution among the provinces.&#13;
1.28   First Level Facilities In Rural Areas: Rural Health Centers in Mozambique were initially&#13;
designed as relatively large units, with correspondingly high staff levels and operating costs. They have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
often operated inefficiently, because larger units are more difficult to manage and because the difficulties&#13;
of rural transport make a catchment area with a radius of more than a few kilometers unrealistic. In the&#13;
future, physical accessibility and population density will be more important criteria in determining the size&#13;
and location of rural health facilities. In general, fewer, if any large health centers will be built, and&#13;
more reliance will be placed on the provision of a larger number of small facilities situated closer to&#13;
people's homes. These health facilities will have preventive, promotive and curative functions. All the&#13;
health centers will be able to carry out normal, deliveries and deal with some of the important common&#13;
complications of childbirth.&#13;
1.29   The goal is that by the year 2005, the number of first level facilities should be close to the number&#13;
which existed before the war: 1,284 primary health care units, including 173 health centers, 661 smaller&#13;
health centers, and 450 health posts. To achieve that goal will require that:&#13;
(a)    173 health centers be rehabilitated and extended, of which 92, in district capitals, will&#13;
have maternity wards;&#13;
(b)    509 health posts be converted to small health centers, and 152 new small health centers&#13;
built;&#13;
(c)    450 village health posts be rehabilitated or built.&#13;
1.30   First Level Facilities In Urban Areas: The urban areas are in a favorable position, compared&#13;
to the rural areas, and no significant expansion is expected in their facilities. Efforts should concentrate&#13;
on improving service quality and efficiency. The strategy dictates that:&#13;
(a)    38 existing urban health centers be renovated, with maternity wards added;&#13;
(b)    48 existing urban health posts be converted to small health centers; and&#13;
(c)    36 small health centers be constructed in peri-urban areas.&#13;
Thus, by the year 2005 the urban areas will have the equivalent of one health center and four small health&#13;
centers for every 50,000 urban inhabitants.&#13;
1.31   Provincial and Central Hospital Network: Urban hospitals, which are relatively well-developed,&#13;
absorb a disproportional amount of health sector expenditures and present ample opportunities for&#13;
improving efficiency. It should be possible to improve the quality and increase the volume of their&#13;
services without a proportionate increase in resource allocation. The strategy for the rehabilitation of&#13;
third and fourth level facilities encompasses:&#13;
(a)    physical rehabilitation of hospitals, which have had essentially no maintenance during the&#13;
past two decades;&#13;
(b)    preparation of development policies for the city hospital network;&#13;
(c)    organizational steps to improve service quality and efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
1.32   Pharmaceuticals. Since 1976, Mozambique has had a National Drug Formulary (NDF) which&#13;
includes, under their generic names, a limited list of drugs and medical supplies deemed essential to&#13;
diagnose, prevent and/or treat the great majority of diseases in the country. The small, well organized&#13;
Formulary explains clearly which drug can be described at which level of care and by which level of&#13;
health worker. The use of generic names in prescribing drugs was made mandatory and the purchase of&#13;
drugs was restricted to those included in the NDF. A Ministerial Decree urged the preparation of&#13;
therapeutic protocols for treatment of the most common diseases, later published as a Therapeutic Guide.&#13;
The use of the protocols approved for treatment of major endemic diseases is compulsory. In spite of a&#13;
relatively effective essential drugs program, lack of foreign exchange and wartime shortages of drugs in&#13;
the health facilities hampered the effectiveness of the health system and affected the trust of the&#13;
population. Specific problems limiting the availability of drugs are irregular imports due to donor&#13;
dependency, irregular distribution, and leakages mainly at the service delivery level.&#13;
1.33   The flight of importing companies and of retail pharmacy owners before and after independence&#13;
led to the creation of the parastatals MEDIMOC to ensure the import and export of pharmaceutical and&#13;
medical supplies and FARMAC to keep the abandoned retail pharmacy network working properly. Since&#13;
1986, MEDIMOC also has been in charge of internal distribution of pharmaceutical products to the&#13;
provincial level. Both organizations are in the process of adapting to the health service expanded coverage&#13;
and the renewed possibility of road transportation and decentralized stockholding which have been made&#13;
possible by peace.&#13;
1.34   Every effort will be made to keep health personnel supplied with essential drugs. The objective&#13;
is to maintain (and hopefully surpass), during the program life, the annual per capita level of&#13;
pharmaceuticals provision of about US$1.20 achieved in 1992-93. To achieve this and improve quality,&#13;
the rehabilitation strategy is to enhance and improve the National Pharmaceutical Policy, based on the&#13;
Essential Drugs Concept, centralized procurement of generic drugs, and development of a quality&#13;
assurance system. Rational use of pharmaceuticals will be promoted at all levels of the health care system&#13;
in order to protect the public and improve the efficiency of drug use; this is specially important since&#13;
drugs absorb a large share of health sector recurrent expenditures.&#13;
1.35   Maintenance. After almost two decades without proper maintenance, all facilities at all levels&#13;
of the health care system are in serious need of rehabilitation, as are diagnostic and support facilities.&#13;
Much too often, capital investments are made in health facilities, equipment and vehicles without adequate&#13;
provision for maintenance. The result is that the new structures and equipment deteriorate rapidly and&#13;
have to be replaced prematurely, so that much of the original investment is wasted. Adequate systems&#13;
of infrastructure and equipment maintenance need to be developed urgently.&#13;
1.36   The implementation of the health sector program, with provision of new or renovated buildings,&#13;
new medical equipment, furniture and vehicles, will require the following corresponding efforts to&#13;
improve maintenance:&#13;
(a)    formulation and adoption of policies, strategies and approaches specifically related to&#13;
maintenance of health care facilities, medical equipment and vehicles, as part of overall&#13;
national health policies;&#13;
(b)    development of a national maintenance plan, which defines the responsibilities of the&#13;
central, provincial and district levels for each type of maintenance for the broad&#13;
categories of facilities,equipment and vehicles;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
(c)    establishment of information systems capable of receiving, assimilating and disseminating&#13;
technical information to the health sector;&#13;
(d)    strengthening of technical service infrastructures attached to national health systems, with&#13;
provision of a framework for effective and sustainable maintenance and repair services,&#13;
with consideration of the recurrent cost implications of maintenance; and&#13;
(e)    strengthening of national maintenance training capacity and training of national, provincial&#13;
and local staff, including technicians, operators and users, within the existing training&#13;
facilities.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
1.37   The MOH institutions evolved to provide central planning, management and support for the&#13;
developing structures, health services and human resources of the sector. More recently, they have been&#13;
made responsible for building the foundations for the decentralization of health services delivery and for&#13;
delegation of greater financial and administrative autonomy to provinces and then to district authorities.&#13;
This will parallel efforts to improve both the quality and the regional distribution of health services, along&#13;
with increased coverage within regions. The main objective of institutional development activities in&#13;
health is to improve the efficiency of resource utilization in the sector, especially with regard to human&#13;
resources which are the binding resource constraint. Therefore, the MOH's institutional development&#13;
activities focus progressively on strengthening the central, provincial and district levels to take on their&#13;
new roles and responsibilities, and on strengthening linkages among and more effective management&#13;
within health units, especially hospitals. Actions required and planned include systems development,&#13;
procedural designs, pre-and in-service training, and the establishment of improved supervision, monitoring&#13;
and feedback.  Initial focus is on the priority areas of training, personnel management, financial&#13;
management, supplies, maintenance, and supervision.&#13;
1.38   Management. Decentralization and Policy Development. A major goal of the rehabilitation&#13;
strategy is the development of a management framework supported by an internal management&#13;
development capacity that would gradually improve the delivery of health services at all levels of the&#13;
health system. In this commitment to management change, the MOH will be guided by the following&#13;
principles:&#13;
(a)    incremental management change, beginning with what exists and improving upon it,&#13;
rather than introducing something entirely new; the changes will begin modestly and later&#13;
increase in scope and intensity;&#13;
(b)    flexibility, to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and adapt to changing&#13;
circumstances, with emphasis on provincial level management which should be developed&#13;
early in the program;&#13;
(c)    collaboration among government, donors and NGOs to ensure compatibility and to forge&#13;
links that allow for learning from each others' experiences.&#13;
1.39   Furthermore, the use of resource allocation as a means of implementing government health policy&#13;
implies reform of the present system of financial management. Procedures must be developed to&#13;
strengthen the links: (a) between health planning and administrative systems (for example, by making&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
budget categories correspond to planning categories such as levels of health care); (b) among the various&#13;
administrative levels of the national health service; (c) among departments of the MOH; (d) between the&#13;
MOH, the Ministry of Finance and Plan; and so on. Such reform will not be easy, but is essential to&#13;
effectively translate health policy into action more effectively.&#13;
1 .40   Supplv System. Improved distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies to health care units&#13;
should lead to more efficient use of available resources and ultimately to better health care. The strategy&#13;
considers the need to integrate the existing MOH distribution system (fragmented by project-driven&#13;
procedures and financing), to establish stock management policies at all levels of the distribution chain,&#13;
and to develop adequate stock control procedures for both pharmaceutical and medical supplies. Efforts&#13;
will be made: (a) to develop or refine standard lists of medical supplies and to prepare a catalogue&#13;
focussing on those items used at primary and secondary levels of health care, to facilitate better&#13;
management; and (b) to develop management capacity at the health unit and provincial levels.&#13;
1.41   Strengthening management capacity should be complemented by provision of better storage&#13;
facilities, including rehabilitation/construction of: (a) regional pharmaceutical warehouses in Maputo,&#13;
Nacala and Beira; and (b) 14 new provincial or inter-district warehouses (10 for medical supplies and 4&#13;
for pharmaceutical) in 8 provinces.&#13;
1.42   Information System.  The health information system, as a key element for better health&#13;
management, is also in need of rationalization, and the elements related to the primary and secondary&#13;
levels of health care, systematically improved since 1989, must be further revised.  Design and&#13;
development of an "integrated" health information system covering epidemiological data, services, finance,&#13;
human resources and supplies is a necessary step towards better policy definition and improvement of&#13;
health sector management. Only necessary data should be collected, analyzed and interpreted in as simple&#13;
a form as possible, and channeled rapidly to those who will use it -- including those who generated the&#13;
data in the first place.&#13;
Human Resources Development&#13;
1.43   Mozambique's national policy regarding human resources for the health sector has developed&#13;
progressively since Independence, when personnel who had gained health care experience during the&#13;
struggle for independence joined those trained earlier as the core of the national health staff. New types&#13;
of health workers were developed in Mozambique to meet specific needs of a health system designed for&#13;
high coverage with basic services. Both the system and its new types of personnel were featured at the&#13;
Alma Ata conference which launched the worldwide Primary Health Care movement in 1978. More than&#13;
10,000 health workers were trained between 1976 and 1992, although from 1982 the intensified war,&#13;
targeting health workers and teachers, forced them to concentrate in provincial and district capitals. A&#13;
1991 MOH review of the national health manpower policies and situation found the majority of health&#13;
workers to be hospital-oriented, concentrated in cities (1/4 in Maputo) and hospitals, and either untrained&#13;
or trained only at a basic level. In 1990, the MOH re-authorized the private practice of medicine&#13;
(outlawed soon after independence).&#13;
1.44   In 1992, as part of development of its health sector recovery strategy, the GOM approved the&#13;
MOH's Health Manpower Development Plan, 1992-2002, through which the Ministry conforms its staff&#13;
training and deployment program to national health policy goals and upgrades the quality and mix of the&#13;
staff and of their skills. The plan also provides for the improvement of training capacity. The training&#13;
institutions involved are the four Health Sciences Institutes (training middle level and specialized workers),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
the six Health Training Centers (training lower level workers), and the WHO/MOH Regional Center for&#13;
Health Development (in Maputo, providing training of trainers and specific courses for workers at mid-&#13;
level and above). The medical school, founded in 1963, continues to graduate 12-20 physicians per year&#13;
and is attempting to strengthen its community medicine program in keeping with community needs and&#13;
national health policy. Polyvalent village health workers (APES), still trained at provincial and district&#13;
level facilities, are not MOH staff members and are not considered in the plan.&#13;
1.45   Health services are only as good as their health workers, who are the most valuable resource of&#13;
any health system. In Mozambique, it is necessary to increase the productivity of health personnel and&#13;
to improve the quality of their care. Measures to be taken to accomplish this include the following:&#13;
(a)    rehabilitate and equip training institutions, strengthen teaching staff, and review and&#13;
revise curricula and training programs and materials;&#13;
(b)    apply stricter educational criteria in the selection of candidates for basic training;&#13;
(c)    place more emphasis on refresher and upgrading courses for existing health personnel;&#13;
(d)    facilitate promotion, including promotion between grades, and base such promotion on&#13;
more objective criteria, so that personnel will have greater professional and material&#13;
incentives to perform well;&#13;
(e)    increase support to existing personnel by establishing systems of in-service training and&#13;
regular supervision and by increasing the flow of professional information; and&#13;
(f)    improve the compensation of health personnel to levels which prevailed at the beginning&#13;
of the 1980's.&#13;
1.46   During the 1980's, many health workers moved from rural to urban areas and from working at&#13;
the first level of care to higher levels. This applied particularly to doctors and nurses, who were capable&#13;
of working in hospitals. With the end of the war, special attention will now be paid to encouraging health&#13;
personnel to work in the rural areas and in under-served provinces where they are greatly needed, and&#13;
to rewarding them for doing so. Among the measures to be taken will be the following:&#13;
(a)    recruit more trainees from underprivileged provinces and areas, since they will be more&#13;
prepared to work in such places after graduation;&#13;
(b)    give priority for post-basic training and for promotion to personnel who have served in&#13;
priority areas;&#13;
(c)    provide housing for rural health personnel;&#13;
(d)    institute a system of allowances to compensate personnel for hardship postings and for&#13;
lost opportunities to earn additional income; and&#13;
(e)    establish clearer regulations regarding the obligation to serve in rural and other priority&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
1.47   The government health budget will be constrained for the foreseeable future. If the real salaries&#13;
of public health workers are to increase, a limit must be placed on the number of health workers that the&#13;
government employs. The Ministries of Health and of Planning and Finance have agreed that in the&#13;
medium term the total number of employees of the national health service should remain effectively at&#13;
the present level (i.e., fluctuating less than 5 percent) and by the turn of the century it will not exceed&#13;
18,000. However, within those limits the numbers of qualified and more highly trained professionals will&#13;
be increased by the following means:&#13;
(a)    some support personnel will be upgraded to become, or will be replaced by, professional&#13;
health personnel; the ratio of trained to untrained employees in the health service will be&#13;
increased from the present 1:1 to 2:1; and&#13;
(b)    the proportion of health workers in the middle and higher grades will be increased; this&#13;
will be achieved by post-basic training and promotion of personnel from lower grades and&#13;
by expansion of recruitment for the basic training of middle and high grades.&#13;
1.48   The key categories of the basic grade will be medical aides (tecnicos and agentes de medicina),&#13;
preventive health aides (tecnicos and agentes de medicina preventiva), and maternal and child health&#13;
nurses (enfermeiros basicos de saade materno infantil). These workers will be the main personnel for&#13;
the new, smaller health centers and the backbone of the primary level services. They will be trained in&#13;
sufficient numbers to staff the rehabilitated and expanded rural health services infrastructure.&#13;
National Programs&#13;
1.49   In an attempt to ensure adequate services and better resource management in key program areas,&#13;
the MOH delineated and implemented national programs in several major areas of health care, with&#13;
centralized management and strict therapeutic norms. Programs were designed and are being implemented&#13;
in Environmental Sanitation, TB and Leprosy, Mother and Child Health (including Family Planning, and&#13;
recently also the Expanded Program of Immunization), Malaria and Bilharzia, and AIDS and Sexually&#13;
Transmitted Diseases. The MOH has also established over the years its own capacity for nutritional and&#13;
epidemiological surveillance, health education, staff training, and statistics collection. The National&#13;
Health Strategy emphasizes integration of the services and management of these programs into the&#13;
mainstream of the overall MOH program. A number of parastatals associated with the MOH are in&#13;
charge of general service and support activities such as equipment maintenance and general supplies.&#13;
D. Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.50   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), presented to the Board jointly with this operation,&#13;
stresses the need for investment in human resources as key instrument in the country's long-term strategy.&#13;
The objective of the CAS is to support the Government's  program   for  poverty  reduction&#13;
through sustainable economic growth. In doing so, the CAS focuses particularly on the medium term&#13;
development efforts directed towards human resources development and economic growth. Economic&#13;
growth is fundamental to poverty reduction in Mozambique, because the country is too poor to rely&#13;
only on redistributive policies for sustained poverty reduction. How growth is achieved will also&#13;
affect poverty. In Mozambique, a poverty reducing growth pattern will involve a shift of&#13;
resources and opportunities toward human resources and the rural areas where the poorest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
populations live. Recent government policy will facilitate this as the marked decrease in military&#13;
expenditures releases resources for increases in the recurrent budgets for health and education services.&#13;
E. Lessons of Past IDA Experience&#13;
1.51   The only previous IDA-financed project in the sector is the on-going Health and Nutrition Project&#13;
(Health I). Implementation of Health I progressed at an unsatisfactory pace between 1989-92, having&#13;
disbursed only about one-fifth of total funds (US$ 6.4 Million, one-third of which being simply the initial&#13;
deposit in the special account) in contrast with the SAR projection of roughly 50 percent over the same&#13;
four year period. In 1992/93, the project was substantially restructured to facilitate implementation and&#13;
to address new sector priorities.&#13;
1.52   At the time the project was restructured, an estimated 70 percent of project funds had not yet been&#13;
contracted. Moreover, some 15 percent of these uncommitted funds were considered unlikely to be spent&#13;
within the remaining life of the project. The restructuring mission indicated to the government that before&#13;
additional IDA funds could be made available under a proposed Health Sector Recovery Program, the&#13;
implementation of Health I had to show significant improvements. In light of the recent important&#13;
political events which have brought access to a previously unreachable countryside, and guided closely&#13;
by the country's health strategy outlined above, the restructuring exercise emphasized a reallocation of&#13;
resources from Maputo to the rural areas, with strong support for pharmaceuticals and training.&#13;
Approximately one-fourth of the credit was re-directed for these purposes. Also, a preliminary costing&#13;
exercise for activities proposed for the Health Sector Recovery Program yielded information on likely&#13;
candidates for early financing within the objectives of Health 1. At the time of the appraisal mission,&#13;
nearly 80 percent of the IDA credit had been formally (i.e., contractually) committed and more than 50&#13;
percent disbursed.&#13;

Box 3: Causes of Implementation Failures in the Early Years of Health I&#13;
Proiect Desizn and Preparation Issues:&#13;
*      The Health I proje(c was identified and prepared during a time when a sector strategy had not&#13;
been ful/v formulated bh MOH.&#13;
*      Ar effectiveness, most components were at early stages of preparation. Few terms of reference&#13;
Jor consultancies andfew procurement documents had been prepared, and much of the costing was&#13;
still tentative.&#13;
*      Shortage of human resources to implement the project was not adequately taken into account,&#13;
especially given the large numbers of implementing agencies involved.&#13;
*      Sonme of the components were included into the project with little participation (and sometimes&#13;
even little consultation) by implementing institutions.&#13;
*      The large number of studies contained in the project was not compatible with the MOH's limited&#13;
ability to absorb information being generated, let alone provide the necessary inputs to their&#13;
irnplementation.&#13;
Proiect Implementation Issues:&#13;
*      For most staff of the MOH, this was the first exposure to preparation of TORs, lists of&#13;
acquisitions, tender documents, etc.&#13;
*      The turnover rate in the MOH was high, especially at senior levels. Few of today's' national&#13;
directors were in volved in the preparation of thefirst project. As a consequence, the general level&#13;
of cotmmitment to the project was low, as was knowledge of project details.&#13;
*      Various MOH depariments coexisted without sufficient coordination oreven the minimum exchange&#13;
of information required for effective implementation of the project.&#13;
*      The MOF's procedures and time requirements for contract approval (averaging 2 months)&#13;
compounded delays in the MOH's own cumbersome procurement procedures.&#13;
*      Procurement and disbursement arrangements adopted were not suitable for the project.&#13;
*      The Bank took too long to realize that the problems in the project would not correct themselves&#13;
with time and that substantial reprogramming of activities would therefore be advisable.&#13;

F. The 1996-2000 Integrated Health Sector Prograni&#13;
1 .54   In recent years, the MOH has increasingly taken the lead in encouraging donor coordination with-&#13;
in the health sector. The National Health Strategy (MHS) acknowledges the cricial importance of donor&#13;
funding for the development of the health sector and the need to involve donors in the health planning&#13;
and review process. The Ministry has held regular donor coordinatioin meetings since 1992, to ensure&#13;
coordinated donor support to the implementation of the health strategy. The MOH has proposed the&#13;
following principles to its donor partners:&#13;
(a)    The MHS will serve as the framework for all donor contributions to the sector and all&#13;
donor support should fit within it.&#13;
(b)    Based on the MHS, the MOH will develop a five-year rolling program and an annual&#13;
budget for recurrent costs. The Program will be discussed and updated annually with all&#13;
donors and will fully reflect all donor support, emphasizing support consonant with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
strategic plan.  The investment program  and the recurrent budget will represent a&#13;
consolidation of the programs from the center, provinces, and districts.&#13;
(c)    For the recurrent budget, all donor support must be channelled to the provinces using a&#13;
single set of planning, budgeting, disbursement and accounting mechanisms.&#13;
(d)    Procedures for procurement of technical assistance, civil works, pharmaceuticals, goods&#13;
and services will be coordinated with the aim to gradually consolidate them.&#13;
(e)    Monitoring and evaluation procedures of donors (including formal audits) will be&#13;
gradually unified and regular supervision coordinated along broad lines of activities.&#13;
Box 5: Movement Toward an Integrated Health Sector Approach in Mozambique&#13;
The Health Sector Recovery Program initially was prepared as a regular investment project with narrow&#13;
objectives and scope. During project preparation, the MOH, IDA and other donors felt that the&#13;
implementation of yet another individual project (adding to a list of over 120 current health projects) would&#13;
impose a heavy burden on the capacity of the ministry. Moreover, the project would have perpetuated the&#13;
provincial fragmentation of external assistance to the country. Also, because the IDA credit would have to&#13;
be justifiable on its own, the project would inevitably focus on the types of sector activities which IDA finds&#13;
palatable but which are not necessarily the highest priorities for the sector given existing commitments by&#13;
other donors. The result would have been an unbalanced program, full of financial gaps in important&#13;
activities which are usually neglected or avoided by donors. Even if we had produced a successful insular&#13;
projecl, our impact would have been small, as is the case with some other such projects in the sector. Even&#13;
the impact of the resulting sector program, the sum of all these insular projects, might well have been small,&#13;
despite a sound sector strategy which has been developed over a period of overfive years in a continuous&#13;
active dialogue with all major donors.&#13;
Because the sector has a coherent and stable strategy, which is accepted by all major donors, it was not&#13;
difficult for the Bank to come in as donor of last resort. During project preparation, the missions, time and&#13;
again, prepared tender documentation for activities that were eventually taken over by other donors. In the&#13;
end, having accepted the overall strategy, the Bank had no difficulty infinancing afew less palatable portions&#13;
of the whole.&#13;

II. THE PROGRAM&#13;
2.1    The ultimate objective of the National             Fgure 2: Heath Sector Program 1996-2000&#13;
Health Strategy (MHS) is the improvement of the     90&#13;
health status of the population, in general, and a  80                     n            G&#13;

particular. MHS objectives are to be achieved       60                                  IDA&#13;
through an increase in health coverage of the       50&#13;
population from the present 40 percent level to    , 40&#13;
60 percent by the turn of the century, with better  30&#13;
quality  of services  provided. Through  the        20&#13;
coordination  of all major donors and  the          10&#13;
government, the Program will finance a five-year     0&#13;

Year&#13;
A. Summary of Program Objectives&#13;
2.2    The Program  supports the same objectives as the Mozambican National Health Strategy, as&#13;
outlined in the previous chapter and is focused on basic services, addressing urban/rural inequities,&#13;
improvement of staff training and institutional development. Being sector-wide, the Program provides&#13;
an operational framework for the overall Ministry of Health. In accordance with the sector's policy and&#13;
strategy and under the overall coordination of the Ministry's Planning Directorate, MOH teams identified&#13;
specific outputs and prepared the various Program components described in this chapter. The Program&#13;
will address the following areas:&#13;
(a)    resumption of and improvement in the quality of health services provided so that the overall&#13;
sector investment strategy yields a higher level of services, as the sector recovers, by:&#13;
(i)      rehabilitating and expanding the network of first level health facilities;&#13;
(ii)     rehabilitating and restructuring the network of rural hospitals, and rehabilitating&#13;
the network of provincial and central hospitals;&#13;
(iii)    strengthening laboratory facilities in health centers and hospitals;&#13;
(iv)     assuring stability in the provision of medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and&#13;
laboratory reagents;&#13;
(v)      supporting a national maintenance strategy in the sector; and&#13;
(vi)     supporting an institutional nutrition program for severely malnourished children&#13;
and for in-patients; and&#13;
(vii)    supporting general provincial operations for health;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
(b)    promotion and improvement of sector institutions, support services and sub-national health&#13;
management systems, by:&#13;
(i)      establishing policies and procedures and expanding storage capacity aimed at&#13;
improving the supply system for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals;&#13;
(ii)    improving the provincial health management system, in coordination with a&#13;
decentralization of functions to the provinces;&#13;
(iii)    supporting and strengthening central administration, thus enabling national&#13;
implementation of the Program;&#13;
(iv)     improving the sector's information system; and&#13;
(v)      supporting the development of sector policy, including systematic evaluations of&#13;
the sector's program based on comprehensive consultations with ultimate clients;&#13;
(c)    development of human resources capacity, by:&#13;
(i)      reassessing and implementing a time-slice of the Health Manpower Development&#13;
Plan;&#13;
(ii)     developing the national capacity for health personnel training;&#13;
(iii)    promoting continuing education of health workers; and&#13;
(iv)     enhancing university medical and health science training.&#13;
B. Detailed Program Description&#13;
2.3    To address these objectives, the Program has three principal domains: (a) Health Services&#13;
Delivery; (b) Institutional Support; and (c) Human Resources Development.&#13;
Domain A. Health Services Delivery (US$ 256.2 million, IDA: US$ 62.8 million)&#13;
2.4   In this domain, the Program aims to support and improve health services delivery, primarily in&#13;
rural areas, through: (i) (re)construction, rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance of infrastructures and&#13;
equipment in the health sector, which are essential for the provision of services at the first and second&#13;
levels of health care; and (ii) stabilization of provision of pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents, medical&#13;
supplies, and food for in-patients. The goal is to improve the health status of the population particularly&#13;
in areas where both health indicators and access to health care are below the national averages. This&#13;
domain also includes all general provincial operations. (paras. 1.21 to 1.36)&#13;
2.5    The two infrastructure development components are: (i) Health Facilities Development and (ii)&#13;
Rural Health Development Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
2.6     Health Facilities Development (US$ 81.6 million, IDA: US$ 16.6 million). The Program will&#13;
(re)construct, upgrade and rehabilitate health facilities at all levels.9&#13;
2.7     The IDA credit will finance: (i) civil works for the rehabilitation of three rural hospitals (Mueda,&#13;
Gurue and Buzi) and houses for hospital staff; (ii) medical equipment, kitchen and laundry equipment and&#13;
furniture for the rehabilitated units; and (iii) motor vehicles and bicycles. Recurrent costs, including&#13;
medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents, and maintenance for the rehabilitated and&#13;
(re)constructed units will also be financed by the credit through national programs.&#13;
2.8     The EU also supports major reconstruction works to the network of rural hospitals. Despite major&#13;
planned contributions by other donors, a shortage of donor funds is expected for the higher levels of care.&#13;
Other donor organizations, including AFDB, DANIDA, FINIDA, NORAD, Italian Cooperation,&#13;
UNICEF, WFP and many NGOs, are heavily involved in the construction of basic care facilities.&#13;
2.9     Rural Health Development Fund (HDF) (US$ 30.7 million, IDA: US$ 15.2 million). The HDF'°&#13;
will provide the MOH with a flexible mechanism to construct/rehabilitate approximately 240 first level&#13;
health facilities and other directly health-related infrastructures. The objectives of the Rural Health&#13;
Development Fund are to improve equity in the distribution of and access to first level health facilities,"&#13;
by: (i) creating a flexible funding mechanism to finance the construction of primary health facilities and&#13;
other facilities directly linked to health services in the poorest, least-served, rural areas; (ii) encouraging&#13;
project-design/implementing capacity at the village level by supporting participatory methodologies and&#13;
MOH-community-NGO partnerships; and (iii) contributing to decentralization and capacity building within&#13;
the MOH by expanding activity, training, and responsibility at the provincial levels.&#13;
2.10   The IDA credit will finance: (i) civil works for the (re)construction of about 240 health centers&#13;
and posts, including water supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) about 600 modest houses for health staff;&#13;
(iii) medical equipment and furniture for the new and rehabilitated units and for other first level facilities;&#13;
and (iv) bicycles and motor bicycles with 2.5 years of spare parts. Recurrent costs, including medical&#13;
supplies, pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents, and maintenance in the (re)constructed units will also be&#13;
financed by the credit through national programs. Staffing of these new and rehabilitated facilities will&#13;
be achieved through redeployment of health workers currently concentrated in cities and by employment&#13;
of limited numbers of new health workers.&#13;
2.11    The Norwegian Government will finance approximately 240 sets of solar panels and related cold&#13;
chain equipment and lighting. The World Food Program will finance the cost of mobilizing unskilled&#13;
community labor with incentive packages consisting of a food ration or a combination of cash and food&#13;
commodities, depending on the food supply situation in each specific location. Community participation&#13;
may include the clearing of land, ground work and brick manufacturing.&#13;
9A significant portion of rural hospital equipment is being procured under the reprogrammed Health and Nutrition Program.&#13;
10 The HDF will assist the MOH in playing its role in planning and coordination of the rehabilitation of the network of first&#13;
level facilities in the country. The HDF will also provide an effective instrument for further pooling of financial assistance.&#13;
1 l The distribution of the moneys of the HDF among the provinces will be based mainly on the number of people per first level&#13;
health facility and on the present average catchment area of these facilities in each province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
2.12   Laboratories Strengthening (US$ 2.6 million. IDA: US$ 2.6 million). The objective is to establish&#13;
a well-functioning network of clinical and public health laboratories to respond adequately to the principal&#13;
health problems in the country. The component will support the gradual improvement of clinical&#13;
laboratory technology and the capacity of bio-medical diagnosis. The component will also support the&#13;
(re)equipment of those facilities which have been prioritized by the MOH. Other essential related&#13;
activities, such as training and supervision, are financed under other components of the Program.&#13;
2.13   The IDA credit will finance: (i) civil works for the rehabilitation of 12 laboratory facilities in first&#13;
and second level health units not included in other components of Health Facilities Development; and (ii)&#13;
equipment and furniture for the same facilities. Recurrent costs, including laboratory reagents and&#13;
maintenance for the rehabilitated facilities, will also be financed through national programs.&#13;
2.14   SDC and (for AIDS control) the EU are financing the strengthening of certain public health&#13;
laboratory facilities, and SAREC research funds are strengthening National Institute of Health&#13;
laboratories.&#13;
2.15   Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies Program (US$ 25.7 million. IDA: US$ 19.6 million). This&#13;
component has as objectives to: (i) provide stability in the procurement and provision of essential drugs&#13;
included in the National Drug Formulary, laboratory reagents and medical supplies to the health facilities&#13;
and other drug outlets throughout the country; and (ii) provide a venue for donor coordination in this sub-&#13;
sector. The Program will provide: (i) a minimum level of the country's needs for these items; and (ii)&#13;
financing for the management and operation of the national drug supply.&#13;
2.16   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the stabilization of the program by assuring a minimum coverage&#13;
of about 10 percent of the national needs in pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents, materials, and medical&#13;
supplies; and (ii) costs incurred in the procurement and distribution of supplies.'2 Other donors will&#13;
finance the balance of the minimum needs for pharmaceuticals, estimated at US$ 1.00 per capita, as well&#13;
as the balance of needs for medical supplies.&#13;
2.17   Donors providing budgetary support through a pooling arrangement for drugs include SDC, EU,&#13;
The Netherlands, Italian Cooperation and WHO. Several donors also provide drugs and medical supplies&#13;
through tied aid arrangements.&#13;
2.18   National Maintenance Program (US$ 4.5 million, IDA: US$ 2.7 million). The Program aims to&#13;
strengthen the establishment of a culture in which the maintenance of civil works and hospital equipment&#13;
again becomes a priority. The current maintenance policy is moving towards a decentralized mode where&#13;
three regional maintenance centers, established within the three central hospitals, are providing services&#13;
and supervision to provincial workshops in the neighboring provinces. At present the MOH is, through&#13;
these provincial and regional maintenance units, responsible for technical assistance (preventive and&#13;
curative maintenance) for four broad categories of items: (i) buildings (including all MOH health service,&#13;
administrative and training facilities); (ii) general hospital equipment (e.g., kitchen and laundry&#13;
equipment); (iii) medical equipment (e.g., X-ray machines, laboratory equipment, etc.); and (iv) light&#13;
preventive maintenance of vehicles.&#13;
12 Until the National Drug Formulary is updated, orders of drugs will require explicit approval by the National Director of&#13;
Health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
2.19   The IDA credit will finance: (i) a part of the national needs in tools and shop equipment for the&#13;
reinforcement of the national and regional centers and the establishment of provincial units; (ii) partial&#13;
needs in spares and materials for the system based on the needs and requests coming from the regional&#13;
and provincial levels; (iii) pre-service training, on-the-job-training, seminars, and supervision activities&#13;
especially regional supervision of provinces; (iv) vehicles for regional centers and motor bikes for the&#13;
provincial units; and (v) technical assistance in hospital maintenance management to be located in the&#13;
national maintenance center, to support the supervision and management of the maintenance&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
2.20   Other donors supporting the National Maintenance Program include The Netherlands and Italian&#13;
Cooperation.&#13;
2.21   Institutional Feeding Program (US$ 10.4 million). The purpose of this component is to: (i) treat&#13;
severely malnourished children; (ii) provide in-patients of hospitals and health centers with adequate food&#13;
in order to accelerate patient recovery and thus increase hospital efficiency; and (iii) provide meals for&#13;
health workers participating in training courses.&#13;
2.22   The Program will finance: (i) food commodities (milk, oil and sugar) for therapeutic feeding of&#13;
severely malnourished children; (ii) the costs of providing regular meals to in-patients as well as health&#13;
workers attending courses in training institutions. The program will be financed by WFP, EU and SDC&#13;
through budgetary support and in-kind participation.&#13;
2.23   General Province Operations (US$ 100.8 million, IDA US$ 6.1 million). This component&#13;
accounts for all recurrent expenditures at the provincial level not included in other national programs.&#13;
The Program will finance part of the non-salary recurrent costs of all province operations. The bulk of&#13;
these expenditures will be financed by the GOM through the national budget.&#13;
2.24   The IDA credit will finance goods and services (e.g., some medical supplies, inputs for&#13;
maintenance of buildings and equipment), which are not being procured centrally through one of the&#13;
national programs.&#13;
2.25   Other donors supporting the general provincial operations, with TA, materials and supplies, and&#13;
budgetary support, include DANIDA, FINIDA, the Italian Cooperation, SDC, WHO and UNICEF.&#13;
Domain B. Institutional Support (US$ 63.6 million, IDA: US$ 14.8 million)&#13;
2.26   In this domain, the Program  aims to support and strengthen the sector management and&#13;
administration capacity through: (i) provision of a framework for continuous and sustainable management&#13;
improvements in the health system, with emphasis on the provincial and district levels and on financial&#13;
and personnel management; (ii) establishment of policies, procedures and infrastructures for effective&#13;
management of supplies; (iii) assistance to GACOPI to improve the administration of projects at central&#13;
and provincial levels; (iv) further development and increased coverage of the Health Information System;&#13;
and (v) assistance to sector policy development and project preparation. This component also includes the&#13;
general central operations. (paras. 1.37 to 1.42)&#13;
2.27   The main donors giving institutional support include AFDB, DANIDA, FINIDA, Italian&#13;
Cooperation, OPEC Fund, SDC, UNICEF and USAID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
2.28   Supply System Improvement (US$ 3.5 million, IDA: US$ 2.7 million). This component will help:&#13;
(i) establish policies, procedures and infrastructure required at the health unit, district and provincial levels&#13;
for effectively matching the supply of health-related commodities, including pharmaceuticals, to needs and&#13;
demands; and (ii) improve the efficiency of overall supply operations for all levels of health facilities. In&#13;
this context, the Program will support the development of a standardized list of basic medical supplies,&#13;
equipment and consumables in common use and of a stock control system at health unit, district, and&#13;
provincial levels.&#13;
2.29   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the development of a standard list of medical supplies in common&#13;
use, the development of a stock control system for use at health unit, district, and provincial levels and&#13;
the framing of a stock-holding policy for provincial health directorates, and further training of health&#13;
workers related to the distribution system; (ii) civil works for the construction of two warehouses for&#13;
medical supplies and pharmaceuticals (Pemba and Lichinga) and the upgrading of the Beira pharmaceutical&#13;
warehouse; (iii) equipment for the warehouses constructed and rehabilitated under the credit (forklifts and&#13;
pallet racks); and (iv) motor vehicles for the sector distribution chain.&#13;
2.30   The civil works financed by IDA complement major contributions of other donors for the&#13;
construction of warehouses in Chokwe, Mocuba and Cuamba. UNICEF supports the improvement of the&#13;
MOH transportation system.&#13;
2.31   Provincial Health Management Improvement (US$ 8.9 million, IDA: US$ 3.0 million). This&#13;
component will assist in: (i) identifying management problem areas, especially at the provincial level;&#13;
(ii) providing an overall framework and a realistic schedule for continuous and sustainable management&#13;
improvement at all levels; and (iii) undertaking actions derived from the problem identification and&#13;
framework development phases of the management improvement effort targeted at strengthening&#13;
management and administrative capacities within provincial-level health care operations, with special&#13;
attention to personnel and financial management systems and to donor coordination.&#13;
2.32   The component will operate at several levels over the course of the Program to strengthen&#13;
management capacities at the provincial and district levels, to improve task monitoring as well as health&#13;
post, health center, rural hospital and provincial hospital administration. The management improvement&#13;
program would focus initially on the provincial level and subsequently on district level operations. In&#13;
personnel management, the specific objectives are: (i) development of a personnel database at central and&#13;
provincial levels to improve the accuracy of personnel data; and (ii) delegation to the provinces of&#13;
decision making authority in most matters of staff management. In financial management improvement,&#13;
the specific objectives are: (i) strengthening procedures to coordinate the planning and budgeting activities&#13;
of the health sector, and development of a financial information system to support decision-making; (ii)&#13;
improvement of the financial management procedures to facilitate the coordination of external aid; and&#13;
(iii) improvement of the cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
2.33   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the identification of management problem areas, the development&#13;
of actions derived from problem identification and the decentralization process of the sector management&#13;
with emphasis on personnel management - development of the personnel database, and procedures manual&#13;
and training of central and provincial staff - and finance management - improvement of public budget&#13;
management and external aid management, development of the sectoral financial information system,&#13;
consolidation of the cost recovery mechanisms and development and installation of an accounting plan&#13;
adapted for the health units; (ii) computers and other equipment and furniture for central and provincial&#13;
levels needed to improve personnel and finance management; (iii) minor civil works -- repairs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
facilities upgrading -- at the provincial health directorates; (iv) partial needs for office supplies; and (v)&#13;
partial needs for supervision and support visits by central and provincial staff, complemented by visits and&#13;
in-service training provided through the Human Resources Development component.&#13;
2.34   Other donors supporting management improvement at the provincial level include DANIDA,&#13;
FINIDA, Italian Cooperation, Netherlands, NORAD, SDC, UNICEF and USAID.&#13;
2.35   Information System Improvement (US$ 2.5 million. IDA: US$ 1.3 million). This component&#13;
supports the further development and expanded coverage of the Health Information System (HIS), the core&#13;
of which has already been developed by the MOH and is presently being implemented for levels I and&#13;
11 of the health care system. Under the Program, support will be provided for HIS expansion to include&#13;
definition, collection, processing and use of basic epidemiologic and basic hospital efficiency and services&#13;
data for Levels III and IV of the health services system. The Program will support the continuation and&#13;
expansion of internal management information system improvements initiated under the IDA-financed&#13;
Health and Nutrition Project.&#13;
2.36   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the development, pilot testing and installation of the information&#13;
system for provincial hospitals and strengthening of data collection and processing at levels I and II of&#13;
the health system; (ii) computer equipment and furniture for provincial hospitals' statistics units and for&#13;
installation of a pilot data transfer system using a computer networking system linking the provincial and&#13;
central level; and (iii) goods and services for the running of the health information system over a period&#13;
of two and half years.&#13;
2.37   DANIDA and USAID also support strengthening of the Health Information System.&#13;
2.38   Program Management (US$ 47.6 million. IDA: US$ 6.9 million). A number of activities, such&#13;
as those implemented through national programs, are administered at the Ministry (central) level. This&#13;
component accounts for the general recurrent costs, including salaries and goods and services incurred&#13;
by the central agencies and directorates that administer these programs. The Program will provide&#13;
assistance to enable the MOH to improve the administration of investment projects and maintenance&#13;
coordination. The component will also assist in the development of policies to enable the MOH to&#13;
respond to the many challenges being introduced by peace, skilled manpower shortages, massive&#13;
migrations, etc. In addition to funding studies and preliminary policy implementation in areas of&#13;
institutional organization, personnel administration, AIDS, in-patient nutrition, hospital waste disposal and&#13;
family planning, among others, the Program will also finance monitoring and evaluation as well as the&#13;
preparation of new sector projects.&#13;
2.39   The IDA credit will finance: (i) technical assistance to strengthen the national directorates'&#13;
capacity to implement Program activities; (ii) 10 provincial coordinators, 3 engineers, 12 field engineers,&#13;
and 15 basic level technicians for the Provincial Planning Units (NEPs); (iii) vehicles, other equipment&#13;
and furniture to equip the NEPs; (iv) part of GACOPI's and the NEPs' operating costs; (v) studies to&#13;
support policy development at the MOH; (vi) technical assistance to coordinate all monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities in the sector and to assist in the development of technical capacity within the MOH&#13;
to monitor main activities in the sector program and to provide timely evaluation reports for internal use&#13;
as well as by donors; and (vii) preparation of tender documents and for activities to be undertaken in&#13;
future projects of the MOH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2.40   The Program will also finance the recurrent costs of all central operations. The bulk of these&#13;
expenditures will be financed by the GOM through the national budget.&#13;
2.41   Other donors supporting this component include AFDB, Italian Cooperation, OPEC Fund,&#13;
UNICEF and USAID.&#13;
Domain C. Human Resources Development (lS$ 35.9 million. IDA: US$ 21.2 million)&#13;
2.42   The Ministry of Health's plans for the rehabilitation and further development of Mozambique's&#13;
health services recognize that human resources in the sector are a key limiting factor in that development.&#13;
The ten-year Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) for 1992 through 2002, prepared with support&#13;
from the IDA-financed Health and Nutrition Project, was approved in March 1992. The HMDP is based,&#13;
in part, on national level health development plans, but primarily on the analysis of current staff&#13;
composition and training capacity and on MOH projections through 2002 of funds expected to be available&#13;
for MOH staff salaries. HMDP implementation is periodically reviewed in light of growth of the MOH&#13;
budget, progress in strengthening of MOH training capacity, MOH management of Human Resources&#13;
Development, and the implications of peace and of the resultant increased territorial access and major&#13;
population movements. (paras. 1.43 to 1.48)&#13;
2.43  In the domain of Human Resources Development, the Program aims to: (i) assist the MOH in the&#13;
implementation of the Health Manpower Development Plan; (ii) strengthen the national capacity for health&#13;
personnel training; (iii) promote continuing education of health workers; and (iv) provide key support to&#13;
the Faculty of Medicine.&#13;
2.44   Health Manpower Development Plan Implementation (US$ 17.2 million. IDA: US$ 13.6 million).&#13;
This component will assist in the further implementation of the manpower plan by financing a time-slice&#13;
of the total activities foreseen in the plan. The MOH training experience, including experience under the&#13;
Health and Nutrition Project, indicates a likelihood that training delays will slow execution so that three&#13;
years of the plan's courses will be completed during the five years of the Program. Therefore, the&#13;
Program over five years will finance those courses which the plan schedules to begin during the years&#13;
1996, 1997 and 1998 and to be completed before the end of the year 2000 (a total of 48 courses); each&#13;
such course would be financed throughout its entire duration by the credit. In the case that annual&#13;
evaluation shows that training system improvements have led to more rapid implementation such as that&#13;
foreseen in the original manpower plan and therefore to more rapid expenditure of the Program's training&#13;
funds, it is anticipated that other financing will be available to continue the more rapid implementation.&#13;
2.45   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the total costs of implementing 48 courses; and (ii) scholarships&#13;
covering students' partial subsistence, course-related travel and rural practice activities.&#13;
2.46   The main donors involved in this component include AFDB, DANIDA, FINIDA, EU, Italian&#13;
Cooperation, SDC, UNICEF and WHO.&#13;
2.47   Training Capacity Improvement (US$ 12.3 million, IDA: US$ 4.7 million). This component will&#13;
improve the capacity of the MOH to train its staff by financing: (i) upgrading and refurbishing of training&#13;
institutions; and (ii) improving the delivery of training itself.&#13;
2.48   The IDA credit will finance: (i) civil works for rehabilitation and extension of the training&#13;
institutes in Maputo, Beira and Nampula and of training centers in Chicumbane and Chicuque;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
(ii) furniture for the rehabilitated facilities; (iii) training materials and equipment for all health training&#13;
institutes and centers; and (iv) motor vehicles. The credit's contribution complements the civil works&#13;
activities for rehabilitation of the Training Institutes for mid-level healthworkers in Maputo, Beira and&#13;
Nampula and construction/extension of basic training facilities in Cuamba and Lichinga, partially&#13;
implemented under the Health and Nutrition Project.&#13;
2.49   DANIDA, FINIDA, SDC, EU, WFP and UNICEF are the other donors supporting the MHS&#13;
through this component.&#13;
2.50   In-service Training Improvement (US$ 2.6 million. IDA: US$ 2.3). This component will support&#13;
improvements in and rationalization of continuing education activities to improve the effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency of MOH health services and their planning, management and support. The MOH, in&#13;
collaboration with donors, will work to rationalize in-service training, eliminate undesirable overlaps and&#13;
duplications, focus training on priority needs for provision of basic packages of health services, increase&#13;
and monitor training effectiveness, and reduce the training-related losses of service time observed in&#13;
recent years.&#13;
2.51   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the costs of in-service training courses in the MOH/WHO&#13;
Regional Center for Health Development (CRDS) in Maputo; (ii) technical assistance in continuing&#13;
education development and management; (iii) the costs of in-service training activities at the provincial&#13;
level (after selection among province-submitted proposals on the basis of relevance to priorities, likely&#13;
impact, and cost).&#13;
2.52 All other donors supporting the MHS through General Training Operations (e.g., UNICEF, WHO,&#13;
DANIDA, FINIDA, NORAD, SDC, STC, UNFPA, USAID, UNDP) will continue to finance continuing&#13;
education activities. The MOH has initiated discussions of multi-donor pooling of funds to support such&#13;
activities, in keeping with the component's objectives.&#13;
2.53   Faculty of Medicine Sup2ort (US$ 0.6 million, IDA: US$ 0.6 million). The objective of this&#13;
component is to improve the quality of medical training provided at the university, particularly in&#13;
rural/community medicine. The Program will assist in the following areas: (i) training and practical&#13;
experience for medical students in rural facilities and communities, in cooperation with NGOs;&#13;
(ii) provision of texts and reference materials for medical students (including basic reference manuals to&#13;
be retained by them after graduation); and (iii) transportation for students engaged in community medicine&#13;
training.&#13;
2.54   The IDA credit will finance: (i) the cost of textbooks and reference materials for faculty,&#13;
professionals and students; (ii) the cost of setting up, running and supervising rural internships including&#13;
four staff-months of local technical assistance for an external evaluation of this activity; and (iii) a mini-&#13;
bus. Because the Faculty of Medicine is part of the University and funded mainly by and through the&#13;
Ministry of Education, no other funding sources are shown under the MOH Program.&#13;
2.55   General Training Operations (US$ 3.1 million) This component, supported by the EU, UNICEF,&#13;
WHO, NORAD, SDC, UNFPA, USAID, UNDP, DANIDA, FINIDA and the Italian Cooperation&#13;
finances general investment and recurrent expenditures in human resources development, outside those&#13;
outlined in the components above.&#13;
2.56   In addition to taxes on all items financed by IDA, in the Human Resources Development domain,&#13;
government will finance salaries of the students in training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Program Costs&#13;
2.57   The total base cost of the Program is&#13;
approximately US$ 347.9 million, US$ 355.7&#13;
million including contingencies'3.   These&#13;
figures are based on the part of the Program          rig 3: Pr-ogumbpodftu by cad Camgmy&#13;
for which there is agreed funding from&#13;
domestic and foreign sources.  The IDA        100&#13;
credit amounts to US$ 98.7 million.  The      80&#13;
Program will be revised annually, to account  so&#13;
for changes in availability of financing,   i ooLJ&#13;
priorities  and  implementation/ outcomes     40&#13;
performnance.                                 20&#13;
D. Program Financing&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
2.58   The Program is designed to finance a five year time-slice of the MHS. Financing for the first&#13;
three years of the program is based on firmer commitments, whereas the last two years have only partial&#13;
funding to-date.  Alternative scenarios of government commitment to the health sector have been&#13;
developed. Under the base case scenario, the government will contribute approximately US$ 116 million,&#13;
of which some US$ 98 million in recurrent expenditures. This total corresponds to an average of about&#13;
US$ 1.0 per capita annually and is in line with a 4 percent annual increase in the recurrent budget&#13;
between 1996-2000, following a sharp initial increase of over 40 percent for 1995. (para. 1.14) An&#13;
increasing share of the local contribution will come from cost recovery, particularly in pharmaceuticals.&#13;
(Box 2) All major donors operating in the sector, '4in association, have committed to finance, on a parallel&#13;
basis, an estimated sum of about US$ 239 million (IDA included) (Annex-2.1A). The amount of IDA&#13;
financing, US$ 98.7 million, is based on the government's estimate of sustainable financial commitment.&#13;
If the Program is implemented at an accelerated rate, donor support including IDA would be reassessed&#13;
with the objective of maintaining commensurate support. If, on the other hand, the Program experiences&#13;
implementation delays or if co-funding or counterpart funding is not forthcoming, the Program may be&#13;
scaled down at the mid-term review.&#13;

2.59    During the life of the Program, donors will progressively shift the focus of finance from specific&#13;
projects to the Program, with a parallel shift from appraising individual activities to financing shares of&#13;
the whole sector strategy.&#13;
Program Sustairnability&#13;
2.60    The MOH  explicitly designed the National Health Sector Strategy and Program  to deliver a&#13;
cost-effective package of basic health services. The eventual sustainability of services is enhanced by&#13;
emphasis on basic rural facilities, with rural hospitals for referral services, appropriate training and use&#13;
of mid-level health personnel, redeployment of existing resources, provision of generic essential&#13;
medicines, community participation and cost recovery, and strengthened management support and&#13;
supervision. Efficiency will also be enhanced by greater budget flexibility introduced by the integrated&#13;
sector approach. However, in spite of the government's concurrent commitment to increasing levels of&#13;
funding for the sector, foreseeable economic growth in Mozambique indicates that external support will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
be necessary to sustain health and other services for some years after the present time slice financed by&#13;
the IDA credit. (paras. 1.12 and 1.13)&#13;
2.61   IDA financing of incremental recurrent costs amounts to about US$ 8.5 million (excluding&#13;
pharmaceuticals) and represent less than 5 percent of the Programs's total recurrent expenditures&#13;
(excluding pharmaceuticals). If we include pharmaceuticals, the share of IDA's recurrent expenditures&#13;
financing is still only about 10 percent of the total. The share of IDA in recurrent expenditures declines&#13;
over the life of the Program as the government takes on an increasing share of financing of the Program.&#13;
(paras. 1.14 and 2.58) IDA financing of recurrent expenditures concentrates on medical supplies, fuel,&#13;
maintenance inputs and laboratory reagents (as well as pharmaceuticals).  IDA funds are not being&#13;
allocated for salaries of MOH staff. (Annex-2.IA and 2.2B)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
III. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Program Management Structure&#13;
3.1    The MOH, through its line agencies, will have overall responsibility for management of all&#13;
Program activities. The Director of the National Directorate of Planning and Cooperation (DNPC), who&#13;
reports directly to the Minister of Health, will be responsible for coordinating and supervising Program&#13;
implementation. The Director will liaise among the various implementation institutions, the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, the Bank of Mozambique and donors. Assisted by a Program Coordinator, (s)he will meet&#13;
regularly with implementing agencies and will monitor progress, keep program accounts, and prepare&#13;
reports, as required and agreed by the government and donors. To facilitate program coordination and&#13;
monitoring, the Minister's Advisory Board (Conselho Consultivo do Ministro), comprising the Minister,&#13;
the Vice Minister and heads of all national Directorates and Departments, will meet once every three&#13;
months to review progress in all Program activities and to resolve any issues impeding achievement of&#13;
Program objectives. The internal organization of the MOH is presented in Annex-1.1.&#13;
3.2    As program-supported investments (particularly construction and rehabilitation as in the case of&#13;
the Rural Health Development Fund) will be highly concentrated in rural areas and spread over several&#13;
locations in each province, each Provincial Directorate of Health should have technical capacity to take&#13;
responsibility for management of rehabilitation activities. Therefore, Provincial Construction and&#13;
Maintenance Units, which are part of the Provincial Directorate of Health/NEPs, will gradually be&#13;
strengthened in all 10 provinces and Maputo City. These Units, which will be responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day management and monitoring of construction activities, particularly those related to the Rural&#13;
Health Development Fund, will report to the Provincial Director of Health. GACOPI will be in charge&#13;
of preparation of norms and standards for the construction and maintenance of infrastructures and of&#13;
approval of designs and large contracts.&#13;
3.3    GACOPI is the technical unit of the DNPC, in the Central MOH, which is responsible for&#13;
administering and supervising all health sector investments involving construction or rehabilitation of&#13;
equipment and health-related infrastructures, including the preparation of the sector's investment plans.&#13;
GACOPI will also be responsible for the technical coordination of the work of the Provincial Maintenance&#13;
and Construction Units to be strengthened to support the Program. For the purposes of the IDA credit,&#13;
GACOPI will manage financial accounts and procurement processes (for large civil works, and central&#13;
purchases of goods and services). The emphasis is on shifting Program management to lower tiers of&#13;
government and toward greater accountability for implementation processes.  The participation of&#13;
communities in the design (through systematic client consultation--SCC--methodologies) and execution of&#13;
health facilities construction and in other aspects of health services, which is integral to this Program, is&#13;
expected to yield greater efficiency and accountability in the provision of services as well as a greater&#13;
sense of ownership of the Program. (para. 2.9)&#13;
Implementation Agencies&#13;
3.4    The DNPC, directly responsible for overall coordination of the Institutional Support components&#13;
of the Program, also will be directly responsible for the components for: (a) Provincial Health&#13;
Management Improvement; (b) Health Information System Improvement; and (c) Program Management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
The Supply System Improvement component will be a responsibility of the Supplies Directorate, and the&#13;
Financial Management Improvement components will be a responsibility of the Administration and&#13;
Finance Directorate.&#13;
3.5    The National Directorate of Health will be directly responsible, at the central level, for&#13;
implementation of the following components: (a) Health Facilities Development; (b) Rural Health&#13;
Development Fund; (c) Laboratories Strengthening; (d) Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies Program&#13;
Stabilization; (e) Maintenance Program Support; (f) Institutional Feeding Program; and (g) Provincial&#13;
Operations.&#13;
3.6    The HDF will be set up for the (re)construction of first level facilities and small projects directly&#13;
linked to health, targeted to the poorest, least-served, mainly rural areas, as determined by the MOH,&#13;
based on Bank-agreed criteria. In order to prevent the construction of first level facilities which are not&#13;
integrated in a network of services, new first level facilities will only be built within under-served parts&#13;
of the catchment areas of a well functioning second level facility for which health staff is available. The&#13;
Fund will finance small-scale, rapidly disbursing projects to be designed with the assistance of a&#13;
participatory planning process. The local community which will benefit from the new facility will be&#13;
involved in its design, its construction and its maintenance. It is foreseen that a health worker, who is part&#13;
of the personnel structure of the MOH, will be posted in the locality to guide the process of consulting&#13;
the community on the facility and on services to be delivered. The work of the health worker can&#13;
spearhead the process of increasing community organization and capacity, which are essential for broader&#13;
development. Community participation in the construction of a health facility requires the community to&#13;
provide labor, to be partially remunerated. This is seen less as a matter of cost containment than as a way&#13;
to increase community ownership of the health facility. Moreover, the choice of labor-intensive&#13;
technologies will create employment and income (in both cash and food), thereby increasing food security&#13;
for the population and facilitating resettlement and re-integration. The projects will be implemented&#13;
through MOH-community-NGO partnerships. The Fund will be initially administered by the World Food&#13;
Program (WFP), though responsibilities for location determination, construction supervision and&#13;
maintenance will be shared between provincial and central health administrations. However, two provinces&#13;
will be pilots for direct provincial administration of the fund, immediately upon credit effectiveness. Later&#13;
in Program implementation, fund administration would be transferred to provincial governments with&#13;
proven capacity. It is presumed that the transfer of such administrative functions to the provinces will&#13;
be completed by the end of the third year of the Program life. (Para. 2.9)&#13;
3.7    The Directorate of Human Resources will be directly responsible for implementation of the&#13;
following components: (a) Health Manpower Development Plan Implementation; (b) Training Capacity&#13;
Improvement; and (c) Continuing Education. The component in support of the Faculty of Medicine will&#13;
be a responsibility of the Faculty of Medicine at the Eduardo Mondlane University.&#13;
3.8    All the formal training of health staff included in the Program will be carried out at the Health&#13;
Training Institutes and Health Training Centers, of which there is at least one in every province, under&#13;
contracts between the individual training institution and the Directorate of Human Resources. Other&#13;
general training, such as accounting, finance and computer operations, will be carried out by institutions&#13;
outside the Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
Program Implementation Capacity&#13;
3.9    The MOH has overcome the implementation problems encountered in the first years of Health I.&#13;
The MOH is now prepared to implement successfully the proposed, much larger Program, thanks to&#13;
further actions based on lessons learned .n Health I, reduction in the size of the originally proposed credit,&#13;
reductions in the proposed Program's demands on MOH implementation capacity, much more thorough&#13;
preparation of components, a better-defined national health strategy and an improved implementation&#13;
framework, and greatly strengthened donor coordination and consensus in support of health sector&#13;
recovery. A significant proportion of the proposed credit and of the overall program will finance capacity&#13;
expansion and building, including the capacity to implement projects and to continue to rationalize and&#13;
focus the acquisition and use of donor resources in support of the health sector recovery program.&#13;
3.10   Application of Lessons Learned in Health I in the Design of the Proposed Program. Design of&#13;
the proposed Program has benefitted greatly from the application of lessons learned in Health I. At the&#13;
time of Health I's effectiveness, most of its components were at early stages of preparation, few terms&#13;
of reference for consultants and few procurement documents had been prepared, and much of the costing&#13;
was still tentative. The first project's delays in tendering have been countered by extensive planning and&#13;
preparation of tender documents during Program preparation. (Boxes 3 and 4). Recognition of the&#13;
importance of reliable and direct communication with the Bank led to the establishment of All-in-I&#13;
communications with the MOH, which are now being upgraded and expanded. Flexibility to reallocate&#13;
funds during annual reviews according to implementation performance will also help to improve&#13;
implementation and permit greater responsiveness to borrower needs and to the changing national&#13;
situation.&#13;
3.11  Some Features of the Proposed Program Enhancing MOH Implementation. Features incorporated&#13;
in the proposed Program to help assure effective implementation in specific areas can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Civil Works: The Rural Health Development Fund is expected to be administered by the WFP&#13;
initially, in several provinces, with administrative responsibility shifting to the provincial level&#13;
MOH offices as their administrative capacity is sufficiently strengthened; actual execution of the&#13;
component will be carried out by NGOs. Rural hospitals, training institutes and warehouses will&#13;
all be procured out in the private sector, and complete tender documents have been prepared.&#13;
Additionally, a management contractor will be hired by GACOPI to assist with all civil works&#13;
implementation. These features will help avoid two major bottlenecks encountered in Health I,&#13;
weak administrative and civil works implementation capacity and slow preparation of tender&#13;
documents.&#13;
Equipment: Tender documents have been prepared, including most lists of equipment (a major&#13;
bottleneck early in Health I). A procurement agency will be hired to procure medical equipment.&#13;
Goods and Services:  Tender documents have been prepared.  The government-owned&#13;
procurement agency (MEDIMOC) has an excellent track record in procurement of&#13;
pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents and medical supplies.&#13;

*      Trainin2: Tender documents have been prepared. The number of courses scheduled to be carried&#13;
out is about half of the number IDA was requested to finance on the basis of the original&#13;
projections of the Health Manpower Development Plan, having been reduced greatly during&#13;
Program preparation on the basis of experience in the first years of implementation of the plan.&#13;

many donors. That burden will be further&#13;
reduced by arrangements which will concentrate donor missions in two review periods each year.&#13;
B. Program Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.12   As the implementation of the Integrated Health Sector Program gradually shifts from a project&#13;
basis to an approach centered along activity lines, supervision processes will also be increasingly&#13;
undertaken along activity groupings. Supervision missions and supervision instruments (e.g., financial&#13;
audits) as well as procurement and disbursement practices and other common procedures will be organized&#13;
so as to minimize their demand on scarce implementation capacity in the MOH. In supervision and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
monitoring the Program will benefit from the largely untapped potential for inter-donor delegation of&#13;
supervision of activities. This will permit a substantial reduction in the number of missions visiting the&#13;
sector and will help change the focus of assistance and government planning towards sector strategies&#13;
rather than segmented projects.&#13;
3.13   Monitoring procedures and Program reports will focus on progress in and impacts of the&#13;
implementation of the MOH's Program, measured against specific targets and actions set in the five year&#13;
rolling plans and detailed implementation programs, all of which will be reviewed and revised each year&#13;
throughout the Program life. Monitoring procedures and Program reports are designed to meet MOH&#13;
needs for information for decision-making, to fulfill the reporting requirements of donors, and to ensure&#13;
that the plans, programs and actions are in accordance with the MOH's strategy for the health sector.&#13;
General progress of the program will be measured against a list of key indicators (Annex-3.3). This&#13;
limited list of indicators focusses on some critical inputs (e.g., share of health sector in public budget,&#13;
disbursement level, number of facilities built), outputs (e.g., vaccination coverage, drugs availability),&#13;
and outcomes (infant, child and maternal mortality rates, user satisfaction) of the MOH program. Areas&#13;
of special focus, in keeping with the MOH's strategy, will include progress in assuring equitable&#13;
population access to health services providing at least a basic package of health services (with adequate&#13;
quality), coverage indicators, compliance of staffing with national norms, availability and effectiveness&#13;
of key inputs and support for health services, and progress in implementation of policies and programs&#13;
in areas such as infrastructure rehabilitation, human resources, and institutional strengthening.&#13;
3.14   Each year, the MOH will update the five year rolling plan and will prepare the investment and&#13;
recurrent budgets for the next year. These will be discussed with donors. The rolling plan and program&#13;
would identify and prioritize, in the context of the MOH health strategy, the areas for which donor&#13;
support is solicited. During the annual national consultations, IDA and cooperating donors would discuss&#13;
the proposed plans and investments in light of criteria that include cost-effectiveness, institutional capacity&#13;
(at central, provincial and district levels), cost recovery potential, and effectiveness, affordability,&#13;
accessibility and equity of services. An assessment of the effects of decentralizing authority during the&#13;
preceding year, and plans for the upcoming year, will also be on the agenda. In calendar year 1998, a&#13;
midterm review of the Program will be carried out .&#13;
3.15   The Ministry's departments and all donors to the sector will participate in annual review&#13;
workshops, to take place in April following the national consultations. During these workshops, Program&#13;
progress will be monitored and the Ministry will present a revised program of actions. Prior to the annual&#13;
workshop with donors the MOH will present a report on implementation and impact of the Health Sector&#13;
Program. The report will be distributed to the donors no later than March 1 of each year. The report will&#13;
discuss, inter alia, the progress in meeting the agreed output targets, a summary of the beneficiary&#13;
assessments and other external reviews of the previous year, with a summary of actions proposed and&#13;
taken to correct any problems found. Progress in the different components, issues hindering success, and&#13;
proposed solutions will be discussed and decided upon in the workshop. At the end of each workshop,&#13;
donor commitments to the various program components will be expressed and IDA funds may be&#13;
reallocated to finance gaps in identified priority areas.&#13;
3.16   The MOH will prepare semi-annual reports which will tabulate and graphically display physical&#13;
and financial progress during the previous semester and accumulated progress against agreed targets in&#13;
the Implementation Plan and Health Services Delivery Action Plan and highlight problems, with&#13;
recommendations for solving them. These reports will be distributed to donors within one month of the&#13;
end of each semester and will be the subject of a meeting of the Minister of Health's Advisory Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
Minutes of the meeting will be attached to the next such report, with comments indicating actions taken&#13;
since the last meeting. A yearly report will summarize the status of each component and the degree of&#13;
compliance with donor covenants and agreements. The format of these reports will be designed to fulfill&#13;
the MOH needs for summary information for decision making and will also be adapted to satisfy IDA's&#13;
and other donors' reporting requirements.&#13;
3.17   Within six months of the closing of the IDA credit, the MOH will prepare a final report on the&#13;
implementation of the Program.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.18   Procurement under the project would be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January, 1995 with emphasis on community&#13;
participation. The MOH, has prepared a draft procurement/disbursement plan for Bank review. This plan&#13;
will be the basis for project implementation and monitoring by GACOPI. The plan will be reviewed and&#13;
updated at least three months prior to the start of each Program year. GACOPI has agreed to use a&#13;
computerized project management software which includes procurement planning.&#13;
3.19   The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) will be used for International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procurements. Bidding documents agreed upon by the Bank and used in Health I will be&#13;
used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procurements under this Program. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Forms of Contract for Consultant Services will also be used where applicable. One ICB contract&#13;
document and one NCB document for procurement of civil works and goods have been reviewed and&#13;
approved by IDA during appraisal and negotiations. All of the above document formats are available in&#13;
computerized format.&#13;
3.20   Civil Works' total cost is US$ 27.6 million. All contracts for construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
hospitals, warehouses and training centers valued at US$ 500,000 or greater (US$ 15.8 million or 57.3&#13;
percent of total civil works value) shall be procured through ICB. Qualified local contractors participating&#13;
in ICB would be given a 7.5 percent margin of preference in accordance with the Guidelines. Similar&#13;
contracts valued at less than US$ 500,000 up to an aggregate total of US$ 600,000 will be procured using&#13;
NCB procedures approved in the Health I Project. Construction and rehabilitation of about 240 scattered&#13;
health posts plus 600 staff houses and 240 latrines and water wells aggregating to US$ 11.2 million, with&#13;
a maximum value of US$ 60,000 per contract, would be administered through the Rural Health&#13;
Development Fund with community participation in sub-project implementation. The MOH will contract&#13;
with NGOs or small local firms directly on the basis of standard unit prices fixed by the MOH, in&#13;
accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. An estimated 80 percent of the cost of each health unit&#13;
will be financed by IDA and 20 percent by the World Food Program through a food for work scheme.&#13;
This approach will promote the utilization of local know-how and products and promote effective local&#13;
participation; these contracts are small in value and scattered in nature and would not attract established&#13;
national contractors. (paras. 2.9 and 3.6)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
3.21    Goods"5 total cost is estimated at US$ 45.8 million, including health equipment kits, hospital&#13;
furniture equipment and supplies, training center furniture and supplies, warehouse stacking and&#13;
operational equipment, transport vehicles, pharmaceuticals, laboratory reagents and medical supplies,&#13;
textbooks and learning materials, and office furniture, equipment, technology supplies and fuel.&#13;
Procurements will be bulked where feasible and packages valued at US$ 100,000 or more will be&#13;
procured using ICB (US$ 35.0 million or 76.4 percent). Procurements valued at less than US$ 100,000&#13;
up to an aggregate total of US$ 2.4 million will be procured using NCB procedures agreed to in the&#13;
Health I Project. Implementation of the program would require the purchase of relatively small, primarily&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
consumable items, by MOH local offices, provincial authorities and communities around the Country,&#13;
which would be difficult and impractical to package and procure following NCB procedures. Thus, such&#13;
items costing less than US$ 30,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate of US$ 2.5 million may&#13;
be procured through prudent local shopping on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three local&#13;
reputable suppliers. Textbooks, periodicals, spare parts, operating expenditures, minor off-the-shelf items,&#13;
pharmaceuticals and other proprietary items costing less than US$ 20,000 equivalent per contract up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$ 5.9 million equivalent, may be procured directly from manufacturers and authorized&#13;
local distributors. These purchases will be largely made by provincial governments through Simplified&#13;
Disbursement Procedures which provide for advancing of funds from the special account for a period of&#13;
up to three months to implement a clearly defined work program (paras. 3.28 and 3.30).&#13;
3.22   Consultants' services to an aggregate total of US$ 13.7 million for civil works Programn&#13;
supervision, human resources development, financial management, information systems development,&#13;
procurement agents and other supervision and administration functions will be selected in accordance the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants dated August, 1981. Terms of reference for all major&#13;
consultancy contracts have been reviewed and approved by IDA during appraisal and negotiations.&#13;
3.23   Training costs financed by IDA aggregating to US$ 16.5 million include fees for courses and&#13;
workshops for Program-related subjects. Recurrent costs for such items as travel tickets related to&#13;
training activities are included in this category along with fellowship allowances consisting of room, board&#13;
and living expense stipends to national students resident and non-resident at the MOH training centers for&#13;
long-term multi-year programs. All training costs will be based upon reasonable established rates&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.24   IDA Review  All contracts for construction of civil works and purchase of goods procured&#13;
following ICB procedures would be subject to prior review. The use of the Bank's SBD would&#13;
considerably expedite the prior review process as IDA review would primarily focus on invitation to bid,&#13;
bid data sheet, contract data, technical specifications, bill of quantities/schedule of requirements and other&#13;
contract-specific items. The first contracts for goods and works procured following NCB procedures&#13;
would also be subject to prior review by IDA. The provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring&#13;
prior IDA review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals,&#13;
evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to contracts with firms estimated to cost less than US$&#13;
100,000 and with individuals estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 each. However, this exception to&#13;
prior IDA review shall not apply to terms of reference, to single source selection of firms, to assignments&#13;
of a critical nature as reasonably determined by IDA or to amendments of contracts raising the contract&#13;
value to US$ 100,000 or above for contracts with firms and US$ 50,000 or above for contracts with&#13;
individuals. All procurements which are not subject to prior review by IDA however will be subject to&#13;
random post review by IDA during scheduled supervision missions. The MOH is required to maintain&#13;
all relevant procurement documentation for subsequent review by IDA. The MOH will submit to IDA&#13;
periodic procurement schedules detailing each procurement in progress and completed as part of the&#13;
normal project reporting exercise.&#13;
3.25   All imports valued at US$ 5,000 or more each and procured under this Program shall be subject&#13;
to preshipment inspection by the government's designated agents for quantity and for quality. If the&#13;
procurement was not made through ICB, preshipment inspection shall also include price verification.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
3.26   All thresholds stated in this section shall be reviewed by the Borrower and IDA on an annual&#13;
basis. Modifications may be agreed upon based on performance and actual values of procurements&#13;
implemented. Amendments to the Credit agreement may be prepared as necessary.&#13;

3.27   Based on the standard disbursement profile for Mozambique adjusted for the the sector's&#13;
strengthened implementation capacity, it can be estimated that the IDA credit will be disbursed over a&#13;
period of 5 years, from 1996-2000, with procurement and disbursements completed by December 31,&#13;
2000 (completion date) and June 30, 2001 (closing date) respectively. The proposed allocation of the&#13;
credit is shown in Table 4. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully document-&#13;
ed, except for contracts not subject to prior review by IDA. For the rest disbursements will be made&#13;
against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) certified by central MOH. Supporting documentation will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
retained by Program executing agencies and will be available for review as requested by World Bank&#13;
supervision missions and Program auditors.&#13;
3.28   For some of the activities to be implemented by the provincial government or their agencies, such&#13;
as those included in the Rural Health Development Fund, Simplified Disbursement Procedures will be&#13;
acceptable to IDA. This procedure will provide for advancing funds from the special account for a period&#13;
of up to three months, six months in the case of the case of the WFP agreement (para. 3.30 (a)) to&#13;
implement a clearly defined work program. Further advances will be dependent upon satisfactory work&#13;
program performance as measured by the physical implementation of the work program.&#13;

Note: Disbursement schedule differs from regional standard profile for the sector due to nature of goods being&#13;
procured and introduction of unique implementation procedures.&#13;
E. Program Accounts and Audits&#13;
Program Accounts&#13;
3.29   Program accounts will be established and maintained by the MOH. A Special Account will be&#13;
opened for this credit and maintained with a conrnercial bank, acceptable to IDA. The maximum balance&#13;
in the Special Account will be US$ 6.5 million, which will cover about 4 months of expenditures.&#13;
3.30   Satisfactory accounting systems have been maintained by the Program management unit (GACOPI)&#13;
under the First Health Project. IDA funds will flow into the Program in three different ways, to be&#13;
accounted for as follows:&#13;
(a)    Civil Works under the Rural Health Development Fund: Under this component,&#13;
sub-projects costing not more than US$ 60,000 each will be financed for Provincial&#13;
Directorates of Health (PDH) under the implementation of a non-governmental&#13;
organization (NGO) approved by the PDH and WFP. At the end of each semester, WFP&#13;
will present to GACOPI an account, supported by invoices of the expenditures. GACOPI&#13;
will request IDA to effect a subsequent disbursement in accordance with the WFP&#13;
activities planned for the following semester and, in turn, present to IDA (semi-annually)&#13;
a replenishment request under the SOE procedure. Over the life of the Program, GACOPI&#13;
is expected to finance on average US$ 1 million in civil works per province (i.e. about&#13;
US$ 10 million for the whole country) by this method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
(b)    Operating Costs and Consumables under General Province Operations (GPOs): IDA is&#13;
expected to provide financing of about US$ 100,000 per province per year, to support the&#13;
general operations of the Provincial and District Directorates of Health following the&#13;
Simplified Disbursement Procedures described in para. 3.28 above. Although these funds&#13;
will support the general health budget, they will not be provided as an integral part of the&#13;
government budget, but parallel to it. This is to prevent them from suffering the usual&#13;
fate of government budgetary allocations, which get lost to the recipient if they are not&#13;
spent by the end of the year.&#13;
(c)    All other funds: will be accounted for by GACOPI in the same way as the IDA funds&#13;
used in the First Health Project.&#13;
Audits&#13;
3.31   The audit of a Program raises the issue of whether the external auditor should audit all the&#13;
expenditures of the Ministry - an unusually expensive and mammoth task for an international accounting&#13;
firm - or audit only the use of IDA funds. In this Program it has been decided to limit the external audit&#13;
by an independent auditor to the use of IDA funds.&#13;
3.32   The Borrower will employ an independent auditor acceptable to IDA to audit the use of all IDA&#13;
funds applied in financing the Program. The only unusual aspect of the audit concerns the IDA funds to&#13;
be disbursed for GPOs. These particular funds are audited by the Ministry of Finance whose audit is&#13;
independently checked annually by auditors of the SDC. To avoid excessive duplication, the SDC has&#13;
agreed to coordinate the annual audits of GPOs.&#13;
3.33   The independent auditor to be employed by the Borrower to audit the use of IDA funding for the&#13;
Program will be required to express a separate opinion in the same audit report on: (a) the Program&#13;
accounts, showing all IDA financing for the Program; (b) the Special Account operated by the Program;&#13;
and (c) the Statements of Expenditures, including those used for civil works under the Rural Health&#13;
Development Fund.&#13;
3.34   As soon as possible after the end of the financial year, but no later than nine months after its&#13;
completion, the government will present audits of the special account and the Program accounts. The&#13;
costs of the audits are eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the credit.&#13;
3.35   The auditor's terms of reference reflecting the conditions described above were reviewed and&#13;
agreed by IDA during negotiations. An accounting manual will be prepared and submitted to IDA for&#13;
review prior to credit signature.&#13;

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1    The main benefits of the Program will be increased coverage and quality of health services and&#13;
increased equity in access to services with a shift of resources toward rural areas and a basic package of&#13;
health care. The main beneficiaries of improved basic facilities will be women and children as the primary&#13;
users of first level health care through MCH-related programs. MOH staff morale and performance are&#13;
expected to benefit from improved training, working conditions and incentives to which the Program&#13;
would contribute. Efficiency of the health services system is also expected to improve with increased skills&#13;
and the shift of human resources toward rural areas, the base levels of the system, and the relatively&#13;
under-served Northern provinces. The Program will generate important external benefits by assisting the&#13;
MOH in the coordination and implementation of projects undertaken by all donors, within the overall&#13;
Program. The Program will also assist in increasing the transparency and efficiency of the sector's&#13;
budgetary process by moving a significant portion of the off-budget expenditures into the budget. (paras&#13;
2.1-2.2)&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
4.2    The main risk of the Program is the MOH's potential difficulty to fully implement parts of the&#13;
sector's extensive list of activities, leading to bottlenecks and inefficient service provision. To address this&#13;
risk, the Program has been designed to support the improvement of management capacity in the MOH&#13;
and aims to coordinate donors' activities so that implementation constraints are alleviated. Moreover, the&#13;
Program's concentration of financing in non-civil works is an attempt to reduce pressure in the area of&#13;
infrastructure implementation, which has proved to be one of the main obstacles to the satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the Health and Nutrition Project. As for human resources development, the MOH has&#13;
limited capacity to manage training resources. To mitigate this problem, training activities and capacity&#13;
improvements will continue to be carefully timed and outputs modestly estimated based on recent past&#13;
experience. Finally, experience from the Health and Nutrition Project has also shown tender document&#13;
preparation to be one of the most stringent constraints to the successful implementation of a health project&#13;
in Mozambique. In order to ensure Program implementation success, from the start, the MOH has&#13;
undertaken an unprecedented effort to prepare tender documents for all major procurement packages prior&#13;
to appraisal. (paras. 3.9-3.11)&#13;
C. Environmental Considerations&#13;
4.3    The Program has been determined to be in Category C. The main positive environmental impact&#13;
the Program is expected to achieve relates to the development of medical waste disposal guidelines to be&#13;
adopted in every health unit constructed by the Program, with financing for an evaluation of the status&#13;
of hospital waste disposal provided for in the Policy Development component. Moreover, proper sanitary&#13;
conditions will be introduced in every health unit and solar energy technology in every rural health&#13;
center/post financed by IDA. Since most health units built by the Program consist of small structures,&#13;
and since most civil works in large structures involve rehabilitation rather than expansion, negative&#13;
enviromnental outputs due to construction are expected to be negligible. No environmental analysis has&#13;
been prepared for this Program. (para 5.1 (c))&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
D. Economic Analysis&#13;
4.4    The project is designed to achieve high gains in health status with the available resources.&#13;
Because the project contains a diverse set of components to provide improved management, logistical&#13;
efficiency, and rehabilitation of facilities, as well as components directly increasing health status, it is not&#13;
possible to obtain precise estimates of the economic benefits.  The sector strategy, on which the&#13;
management, logistics and rehabilitation components are focused, however, is the delivery of an&#13;
appropriate basic package of services. An economic analysis of the contents of the basic package&#13;
demonstrated that they are appropriate to the burden of disease in Mozambique and are expected to be&#13;
cost effective in reducing the burden.&#13;
4.5    Ranked in descending order of the percent of total years of life lost from premature death, the&#13;
major eight disease categories are malaria (16.6 percent), acute respiratory diseases (14.6), diarrheal&#13;
disease (14.3), childhood immunizable diseases (12.7), perinatal causes (8.0), injuries (7.8),&#13;
cardiovascular (5.3), tuberculosis (4.6), sexually transmitted diseases (3.3), nutritional deficiencies (2.5).&#13;
Correspondingly, the basic package supported by the project would provide cost effective treatment&#13;
interventions to address malaria, acute respiratory disease, diarrhea, delivery and postpartum care (which&#13;
can reduce perinatal causes), trauma, malnutrition, and preventive interventions to reduce the incidence&#13;
of childhood inmmunizable diseases, health education and family planning services to reduce STDs, and&#13;
nutritional monitoring. Annex-3.7 provides a comparison of the cost effectiveness of the basic treatment&#13;
and preventive activities included in the basic package with less cost effective alternatives.&#13;
4.6    With only a few exceptions, the most cost effective activities (those below US$ 2.00 per year of&#13;
life gained'6) are community based or primary health care interventions. Only a few secondary and&#13;
tertiary care interventions are below US$ 3.00 per year of life gained. The most cost effective application&#13;
of secondary and tertiary care is the treatment of acute respiratory infections and diarrhea. Treatment of&#13;
injuries and chronic diseases of adults is much less cost effective. Because the project contains wide&#13;
latitude in implementation of components, the cost effectiveness analysis will be continued during&#13;
implementation and discussed with the MOH to promote cost effective adjustment of individual activities.&#13;
4.7    In addition to the focus on cost effective interventions, the Program is expected to yield substantial&#13;
reductions in cost per life year saved. For example, the combined impact of increased coverage and&#13;
improved quality of services (including better sector management) is estimated to reduce the cost per life&#13;
year saved for treatment of children with respiratory diseases, malaria and diarrhea diseases by about&#13;
55 %. Even if the rate of implementation of the infrastructure expansion program is 50% slower than&#13;
predicted, the cost per life year saved is still reduced by nearly 20%.&#13;
16 This is the cost per life year saved for those treated. Since coverage is sparse, the aggregate cost per life year saved by&#13;
the treatment of these diseases (i.e., taking into account difficulty of access to a health unit by the population) is higher (see Annex&#13;
3.7 Tables E and F).&#13;

Dear Sir,&#13;
Re: Mozambicue Health Sector Letter of Policv&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Mozambique's epidemiological pattern and its health indicators are typical of a&#13;
developing country in a pre-transitional period. Available data on morbidity and&#13;
mortality indicate infectious and parasitic diseases as the main causes of illness and&#13;
death; namely malaria, acute gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, measles,&#13;
tuberculosis and parasitic infections of the digestive system and urinary tract.&#13;
Quantitative and qualitative dietary deficiencies,  inadequate hygiene and&#13;
environment sanitation, safe water shortages, limited access to health care,&#13;
illiteracy and insufficient access to risk-reduction information are all compounding&#13;
factors in morbidity and mortality, especially for women and children. High&#13;
maternal and infant mortality rates have been associated with insuffcient health&#13;
care provision. More recently, anecdotal observations suggest that violence and&#13;
road accidents are among the major causes of death among adults, particularly in&#13;
urban settings. Of the total hospital deaths among adults in the country,&#13;
tuberculosis accounts for about 29%. The HIV pandemic in the c6lntry presents the&#13;
same trend of other African countries; i.e., heterosexual transmission and geometric&#13;
evolution of the incidence rate. By 1994 about 1,360 AIDS cases have been reported&#13;
to WHO; but the real number is thought to be higher given the diagnostic&#13;
constraints related to lack of laboratory facilities and limited access to health care.&#13;
According to surveys carried out by the Ministry of Health (MoH), the prevalence&#13;
of chronic malnutrition (height-for age) is around 30-40% while acute malnutrition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50 -                               Annex -1.2 A&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
prevalence (weight-for-height) is estimated in 6% of those surveyed. Despite this,&#13;
recent data suggests a slight improvement in nutritional status in some parts of the&#13;
country during 1993 as a result of peace and resumption of farming and economic&#13;
activities in the countryside. However, 60% of the population are living below the&#13;
poverty line making the majority of the population a "vulnerable group". In general,&#13;
nutritional problems are still prevalent and may exasperate existing health&#13;
problems. In addition, the drought that affects the central and southern part of the&#13;
country poses a threat to the food security of a considerable number of persons.&#13;
Average life expectancy, estimated from the 1980 census data, ranges from 42 to&#13;
45 years. Infant mortality rate was estimated to be 162 per 1,000 live birth, and&#13;
child mortality rate stands at 275 per 1,000. In general, Mozambique's social&#13;
indicators are lower than those of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
Following the establishment of peace and security, refugees and displaced persons&#13;
begun to return to their places of origin or choice. Demand for health care is&#13;
increasing in urban settings and places of resettlement of former displaced persons.&#13;
Health Policy and Strategy: the future National Health System (NHS)&#13;
The basic assumptions underlying the strategy for the NHS reconstruction and&#13;
expansion, and the vision sketched below, are the following:&#13;
* peace and political stability&#13;
* the absence of major natural disasters&#13;
* a sustained economic growth&#13;
* the government's unchanging commitment to Health&#13;
* continuous support from the international community&#13;
* a progressive reduction of poverty, enabling more people to contribute to&#13;
service financing.&#13;
The transition from emergency relief to rehabilitation and development imposes&#13;
changes both in policy and in approaches. The reconstruction of the Health sector is&#13;
not the simple restoration of physical infrastructures destroyed during the war. It&#13;
offers opportunities for redefining development priorities and readjusting some&#13;
major imbalances in resource allocation, planning the health network according to&#13;
the present and future demand and attempting to redress the imbalances inherited&#13;
from the colonial rule.&#13;
The reconstruction strategy encompasses: (i) maximizing the benefits from the use&#13;
of available resources, (ii) fairness in distributing resources and equity in the&#13;
access to health care, by region and social groups; (iii) user's free choice of health&#13;
care provider; (iv) integration of the public and private sectors (including NGOs);&#13;
(v) preserving the positive experience gained by the NHS in implementing primary&#13;
health care.&#13;
Health care and Rehabilitation Strategy&#13;
Comprehensive Primary Health Care will be the basis for health care delivery;&#13;
services' coverage will be expanded in rural areas. Neglected provinces, such as&#13;
Zamb6zia, will get substantial extra investments, to reduce the existing gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex - 1.2A&#13;
-51 -                                Page 3 of 11&#13;
Assurance of timely referral of patients to higher tiers of the health care system&#13;
constitutes an important concern. . Almost all existing health units, from health&#13;
posts to hospitals, need renovation or rebuilding and improvements in their&#13;
supportive diagnostic facilities. Similarly, improved management, efficiency and&#13;
quality of hospitals, as well as better facilities and equipment maintenance are&#13;
considered crucial.&#13;
The MoH will gradually expand the existing health network with emphasis on the&#13;
PHC level. The Governrent will encourage the participation of non-profit, non-&#13;
government organizations, both national and international, in the rehabilitation&#13;
process, addressing the need for readjusting the present imbalance in the network&#13;
distribution, locating facilities near population settlements, or where users can&#13;
easily reach them by road.&#13;
The MoH projections predict the introduction of the Small Health Center (Centro de&#13;
Sauide tipo III), besides health centers and health posts. The Small Health Center&#13;
is a unit capable of providing preventive and MCH &amp; FP services, along with&#13;
outpatients and medical emergencies. Most os these units will be the result of the&#13;
upgrading of the existing health posts. By the year 2005, there should be 1,284&#13;
first level health units, i.e., 173 Large Health Centers (Centro de Sauide tipo I &amp;&#13;
II), 661 Small Health Centers and 450 Health Posts.&#13;
Immunization delivery points will double, up to 850 and vaccinations will be&#13;
offered routinely at the health facilities and outside, reaching remote communities.&#13;
Clinical laboratories will function in each "Large" Health Center. MCH care will be&#13;
systematically included in the package. A substantial improvement in the people's&#13;
health status is expected from the implementation of this strategy.&#13;
Rural hospitals play a crucial role in the health care delivery system, providing&#13;
referral and logistic support to the first level; they enhance the system credibility,&#13;
making critical services available in rural areas. Concentrating better (to some&#13;
extent) resources available in rural areas, represents a model of health care and an&#13;
attraction pole for users. Unfortunately, mainly because of capital shortage, the&#13;
rural hospitals' network has always been insufficient in Mozambique. Its extension&#13;
is considered an essential move for the whole reconstruction exercise. In this view,&#13;
all the existing 24 rural hospitals should be rehabilitated by the year 2005. Many of&#13;
them will be upgraded and other 15 rural hospitals will be built in the same period.&#13;
Most of the new proposed rural hospitals should result from upgrading and&#13;
expansion of existing health centers. The selection criteria for its location include&#13;
the size of the target population, availability of adequate communication (roads)&#13;
and the economic importance of the district. Once the cycle is completed, an&#13;
average rural hospital will have a hundred beds, providing referral and backup&#13;
services (drug and vaccine distribution, supervision, etc.) to a cluster of 3-4&#13;
districts, serving a population of 300,000-500,000. This will be well below African&#13;
standards (100,000-200,000), but a dramatic progress for rural Mozambique.&#13;
Top-level facilities include Provincial,  Central and Specialized Hospitals,  all&#13;
located in urban areas, which also have a comparatively privileged primary health&#13;
care network. Given health expenditure constraints, no significant expansion is&#13;
expected in the urban areas. The hospitals absorb most of the Health sector&#13;
expenditures. The rehabilitation strategy encompasses the physical rehabilitation&#13;

of these health units that have had no maintenance during the past two decades,&#13;
and organizational steps toward better service quality and efficiency.&#13;
Decentralization&#13;
Local authorities will become totally or partially responsible for several activities:&#13;
-management of some local revenues (fees, etc.)&#13;
-small scale investments&#13;
-management of special program's funds&#13;
-facilities and equipment maintenance&#13;
-in-service training&#13;
-elementary-level pre-service training&#13;
-basic-and elementary staff management, including hiring and dismissing&#13;
-community health workers' training, support, supply, and supervision&#13;
MoH' headquarters will be still in charge of critical activities:&#13;
-deployment of university-and mid-level personnel&#13;
-import of drugs&#13;
-large investments&#13;
-pre-service training&#13;
-allocation of public funds&#13;
-policy making and strategic planning&#13;
-standards setting&#13;
-quality control&#13;
Special health programs should be progressively reduced in size; some dismantled,&#13;
and others merged. Management of funds should devolve almost entirely to&#13;
provinces and later to districts. At this level, decisions should be taken together by&#13;
locally elected bodies and centrally appointed technical authorities.&#13;
The pace and the exact extent of these changes are unclear. The Government is still&#13;
exploring the issue. A progressive shift, made through small adjustments, is&#13;
anticipated. By 2002, some of the functions to be handed over to local authorities&#13;
might still be run by MoH. However, there is evidence that the thrust toward&#13;
decentralization is growing.&#13;
Human Resources&#13;
In developing human resources the aim is to improve the work-force's technical&#13;
skills, making sure that new employees are hired only when there is a&#13;
demonstrated need that cannot be met effectively by other means. Better staff&#13;
management at all levels should increase morale, productivity, and the equity and&#13;
quality of care. Better living conditions for health workers are instrumental to&#13;
stabilize and motivate them.&#13;
In the short run, the number of health workers should not increase, but rather be&#13;
kept at the present figure of approximately 17,000. This, coupled with an increase&#13;
in state revenues, should allow an improvement in staff earnings in real terms.&#13;
The strategy and priorities set by the government permit a proportional increase of&#13;
skilled personnel in relation to unskilled staff, from the 1991 ratio of 1:1 to 2:1 by&#13;
the year 2002. The number of mid-level professionals should increase through the&#13;

replacement of losses with more qualified staff and through promotion from lower&#13;
levels. The Health Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) gives priority to&#13;
training PHC-oriented personnel. Substantial inputs will be given for the training&#13;
of Medical Assistants (Tecnicos de Medicina) and Medical Agents (Agentes de&#13;
Medicina) who are expected to be in charge of health centers, to lead health teams,&#13;
and at the same time provide curative care. By 2002, 1,500 Medical Assistants&#13;
would have been trained. At this point, large and small health centers will have at&#13;
least one T6cnico or Agente, respectively. They will run a facility adequately&#13;
staffed by a balanced health team: MCH, preventive medicine, inpatient care,&#13;
pharmacy, laboratory and administration will all be covered.&#13;
Staffing improvement will not be restricted to the PHC network; mid-level nurses&#13;
and midwives are being trained to strengthen hospital capacity, to cope with the&#13;
expected workload expansion and to improve the quality of care.&#13;
Financial Resources&#13;
The policies and strategies above outlined were translated in a sectoral program&#13;
covering the 1996-2000 period: the Health Sector Recovery Program (HSRP), and&#13;
in the Economic and Social Program of the Government for the next five years&#13;
recently approved by the parliament. Financial resources for the HSRP will arise&#13;
from a number of different sources, i.e.; government, grant aid, and soft loan funds.&#13;
The IDA financed portion of the HSRP is one of the major loan sources and&#13;
constitutes a slice of the program financing during the period.&#13;
The government financial resources for the program were estimated from the&#13;
figures for 1995, a year in which a substantial increase in real terms (about 40%)&#13;
of the Health sector recurrent budget took place. During the program lifetime the&#13;
government will increase the sector's recurrent budget by 4 % p.a. in real terms. The&#13;
anticipated growth of the government financing means an increase in the per-capita&#13;
recurrent expenditure of approximately 1.3% p.a., and will allow for improvement of&#13;
the quality of services delivered to the population.&#13;
Based on GDP growth estimates of 5% and Recurrent Public Expenditure growth of&#13;
1.8% p.a. (payment of interests excluded) the share of the Health sector in the&#13;
recurrent budget will increase from 6.2% in 1995 to 6.9% in the year 2000. It is also&#13;
anticipated that the Public Investment Budget  (government contribution to&#13;
externally financed projects) will increase at a rate of 3% p.a. during the program&#13;
life while the Health sector investment budget will grow 4 % p.a., in the same&#13;
period. Therefore, the share of the Health sector in the investment budget will&#13;
increase from 6.9% in 1995 to about 7.2% by the year 2000. These increases in the&#13;
recurrent and investment budgets will be revised annually to reflect improvements&#13;
in macro-economic performance.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
Cost recovery,  excluding drugs,  represented about 4.2%  of Government&#13;
recurrent health expenditures in 1987. By 1995 cost sharing represented only 2% of&#13;
the government recurrent expenditure. A plan will be operationalized to implement&#13;
the recommendations of a cost recovery study conducted under the IDA financed&#13;
Health and Nutrition Project. The plan includes among other measures updating of&#13;
IL&#13;

the fees that are collected in the health units, both in-patients and outpatients&#13;
charges, reduction of government subsidy for pharmaceuticals dispensed in the&#13;
public sector, regulation of the "special clinics", and other internal administrative&#13;
measures to enhance revenue generation and utilization. It is anticipated that the&#13;
level of cost recovery will increase from 2 % to 10 % of the government recurrent&#13;
expenditure in the 1996-2000 period. This will help to ensure a long term stability&#13;
of internally generated financial resources for the sector. Measures will be taken to&#13;
safeguard the accessibility of the poor people to health care.&#13;

Mrs. Katherine Marshall&#13;

MOZAMBIOUE Health Sector Recovery Project (HRSP): Letter of&#13;
Commitment of Local Resources&#13;
1.   This letter is to confirm that the Government of Mozambique&#13;
(GOM) is committed to implement a five year $ 355 million USD&#13;
multi-donor financed program: The Health Sector Recovery&#13;
Program.&#13;
2.   The GOM is committed to include in the Trianual Investment&#13;
Plan (PTIP) the necessary counterpart funds for the programed&#13;
investment.  The  GOM  will  finance  the  "required  local&#13;
contribution"i for the various components of the program, as&#13;
agreed  with   the   concerned   financing   agencies.   This&#13;
contribution will include both investment counterpart and&#13;
domestic recurrent expenditures funds for the HSRP.&#13;
3.   The  GOM  financial  resources  for  the  program  were&#13;
estimated from the figures for 1995, a year in which a&#13;
substantial increase in real terms   (about 40%) of the&#13;
Health sector recurrent budget took place. During the&#13;
program lifetime the government will increase the&#13;
sector's recurrent budget at minimum by 4 k p.a. in real&#13;
terms.&#13;
4.   The anticipated growth of the government financing means&#13;
an increase in the per-capita recurrent expenditure of&#13;
approximately 1.3% p.a., and will allow for a significant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

improvement of the quality of services delivered to the&#13;
population.&#13;
S.   It is also anticipated that the government contribution to&#13;
Investment Budget will increase at a rate of 3% p.a. during&#13;
the program life while the Health sector Investment Budget&#13;
will grow at 4% p.a. in the same period.&#13;
6.   The GOM is committed to revise annually the above stated&#13;
increases in the rate of growth in recurrent and investment&#13;
expenditures of the Health Sector in a manner commensurate&#13;
with    improvements    in    macro-economic    perfomance.&#13;
7.   A cost recovery plan will be operationalized to implement the&#13;
recommendations of a study conducted under the IDA financed&#13;
Health and Nutrition Project. The plan includes, among other&#13;
measures, updating of the fees that are collected in the&#13;
health units, both in-patients and outpatients charges,&#13;
reduction of government subsidy for pharmaceuticals dispensed&#13;
in the public sector,  regulation of the 'special clinics',&#13;
and other internal administrative measures to enhance revenue&#13;
generation and utilization. It is anticipated that the level&#13;
of cost recovery will increase from 2 % to 10 I of the&#13;
government recurrent expenditure in the 1996-2000 period.&#13;
This will help to ensure a long term stability of internally&#13;
generated financial resources for the sector. Measures will&#13;
be taken to safeguard the accessibility of the poor people to&#13;
health care.&#13;

The equity index calculates the ratio of availability and accessibility of basic services in the best and least served populations within each province. The                     C s&#13;
value 8 represents a national average of the provincial values. The indicator allows the program to focus on the provinces with the highest inequity. The&#13;
national target for the year 2000 is still being discussed within the MOH.&#13;
Small urban survey in Maputo, 1994.&#13;

HEALTH SECTOR RECOVERY PROGRAM&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
Supervision of the Program will be arranged and timed in such a way that the effort is most useful in&#13;
the program cycle of the Ministry of Health, immediately after the national consultations in the&#13;
Conselho Coordinador in March/April of each year and again six months later. It is envisioned that&#13;
considerable staffing resources will be required for the supervision of the Program, especially if&#13;
increased donor coordination is to be achieved over the first years of the Program. However, a&#13;
reduction of the Bank's inputs into supervision should be possible at a later stage, as the implementation&#13;
of the integrated sector program, supported by all donors, gradually shifts from a project basis to an&#13;
approach along activity groupings, with supervision tasks divided accordingly among donors.&#13;
Arrangements for joint supervision with other donors have been discussed during preparation. With&#13;
SDC, agreement has been reached for joint auditing of provincial operational budgets, which are&#13;
supported by both IDA and SDC. Joint supervision missions will reduce substantial the heavy burden&#13;
on the staff of the Ministry to attend to all supervising donors separately and will help change the focus&#13;
of assistance and Government planning from segmented projects to sector-wide programming.&#13;
The annual program implementation review, each March/April, will focus on overall achievements of&#13;
the program of the Ministry of Health in reaching set targets for outputs and outcomes. The review&#13;
will rely primarily on reports which the MOH itself needs as information for decision making. A list of&#13;
indicators to measure key inputs, outputs and outcomes has been developed by the - MOH and the&#13;
donors. Based on findings during the annual review, Program funds may be rescheduled within and&#13;
among components, as the Ministry updates its five year rolling plan.&#13;

Economic Analysis of the Basic Package&#13;
An analysis of the basic package was carried out in two steps. First, the basis for the package was&#13;
established through calculation of the burden of disease by individual categories. Second, the cost&#13;
effectiveness of activities in the basic package to reduce the burden of disease was established through a&#13;
cost effectiveness analysis across a number of alternative interventions.&#13;
Burden of Disease&#13;
Methodology. The years of life lost from premature death were calculated using age-specific mortality&#13;
rates by disease and a life table giving life expectancy by age cohort. The age-specific mortality pattern&#13;
for Sub-Saharan Africa used in the World Bank Global Burden of Disease (GBD) exercise was adapted&#13;
to Mozambique. Key inputs that were tailored to Mozambique were the mortality from HIV&#13;
seroprevalence, maternity, malaria nutritional deficiencies, and injuries, in addition to fertility, and the&#13;
population age structure.&#13;
Results. Table 3.7A ranks the major disease categories in decreasing order of importance. The top five&#13;
categories are malaria, acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, childhood diseases, and perinatal&#13;
mortality. Together these five causes account for over 65 percent of premature mortality. Aggregated&#13;
across major disease groups, communicable diseases account for 77 percent, chronic diseases 15 percent,&#13;
and injuries for 8 percent of premature mortality. Table 3.7B gives the detailed estimates of burden of&#13;
disease by age group and sex. The pattern is consistent with the level of development and recent social&#13;
stress in Mozambique. The pattern is also consistent with the project emphasis on a basic package of&#13;
primary services.&#13;
Cost Effectiveness&#13;
Methodology. The effects of selected interventions were measured in terms of life years saved and were&#13;
calculated from estimates of effectiveness, covered population, and the burden of disease. The estimates&#13;
of effects were adapted from the literature and ongoing studies for Tanzania and the Republic of Guinea.&#13;
Intervention costs were estimated from project information as well as adaptation of previous studies.&#13;
Costs were estimated from separate line items for overhead (administration and facility costs), wages,&#13;
equipment, drugs and supplies. Detailed tables setting out the assumptions and calculations for effects&#13;
and costs are available in the project files and are summarized in Tables 3.7C through 3.7F.&#13;
Results. The last column of Tables 3.7C and E give the cost per life years saved. The table gives the&#13;
cost effectiveness of 46 alternative interventions grouped according to the top ten causes of premature&#13;
mortality. The diseases for which the most cost effective interventions exist are ARI, malaria (with the&#13;
exception of treatment for severe malaria), diarrheal disease, childhood diseases (immunizations), and&#13;
selected activities for perinatal/maternal causes and nutrition. Within each category the lowest cost&#13;
interventions are usually delivered at the lowest levels of care. This is emphasized by Tables 3.7D and F&#13;
which provide a regrouping of the cost effectiveness estimates by level of care.&#13;

            The ultimate objective of the Mozambican
            National Health Strategy (MHS), supported by this Second
            Health Project, is the improvement of the health status of
            the population, in general, and a decrease in infant and
            child mortality, in particular. MHS objectives are to be
            achieved through an increase in health coverage of the
            population from the present 40 percent level to 60 percent
            by the turn of the century, with better quality of services
            provided. The project supports the same objectives as the
            MHS, addressing urban/rural inequities, improvement of staff
            training and institutional development. The project will
            address the following areas: 1) resumption of and
            improvement in the quality of health services provided; 2)
            promotion and improvement of sector institutions, support
            services and sub-national health management systems; and 3)
            development of human resources capacity.
