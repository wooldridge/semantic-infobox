Water, sanitation and hygiene are vital&#13;
components of sustainable development&#13;
and the alleviation of poverty. Across&#13;
Africa, political leaders and sector&#13;
specialists are generating new&#13;
momentum in these important areas.&#13;
This Field Note, together with the others&#13;
in the same series, constitutes a timely&#13;
contribution to that work. It is intended&#13;
principally to help politicians, leaders&#13;
and professionals in their activities. As&#13;
the Water Ambassador for Africa,&#13;
invited by the African Development&#13;
Bank and endorsed by the African Water&#13;
Task Force and the African Ministerial     Summary&#13;
Conference on Water (AMCOW),                 In little more than a decade Ghana has transformed the structure and strategy of its&#13;
I commend it to your attention.              rural water supply sector. In 1990 external support agencies, NGOs and a government&#13;
                                             parastatal organisation planned and constructed rural water supplies, and the parastatal&#13;
                                             was also responsible for maintaining them. By 2000, district assemblies and&#13;
                                             communities played a significant role in planning supplies, the private sector had become&#13;

Water Ambassador for Africa                  maintaining their supplies. The new policy and structure are attracting extra funds, and work&#13;
                                             is accelerating.&#13;
                                                 This reform process started with an extended dialogue with the major stakeholders in the&#13;
                                             sector, out of which a new rural water and sanitation policy was developed. The policy was&#13;
                                             then implemented in several large pilot projects, supported by a number of external agencies,&#13;
                                             and finally the lessons from those projects were incorporated into the national programme&#13;
                                             itself. Both the policy and the process by which it was developed are of interest.&#13;
                                                 Certain conditions specific to Ghana favoured the new policy, but other elements in&#13;
                                             Ghana's path to success are replicable. The latter include: the extended policy dialogue; pilot&#13;
                                             testing; the phased transfer of responsibilities to districts; and the involvement of NGOs and&#13;

            Rural water sector reform in Ghana : a
            major change in policy and structure
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In little more than a decade Ghana has
            transformed the structure and strategy of its rural water
            supply sector. In 1990 external support agencies,
            nongovernmental organizations and a government parastatal
            organization planned and constructed rural water supplies,
            and the parastatal was also responsible for maintaining
            them. By 2000, district assemblies and communities played a
            significant role in planning supplies, the private sector
            had become active in drilling and other water supply
            services, and communities had full responsibility for
            maintaining their supplies. The new policy and structure are
            attracting extra funds, and work is accelerating. This
            reform process started with an extended dialogue with the
            major stakeholders in the sector, out of which a new rural
            water and sanitation policy was developed. The policy was
            then implemented in several large pilot projects, supported
            by a number of external agencies, and finally the lessons
            from those projects were incorporated into the national
            program itself. Both the policy and the process by which it
            was developed are of interest. Certain conditions specific
            to Ghana favored the new policy, but other elements in
            Ghana's path to success are replicable. The latter
            include: the extended policy dialogue; pilot testing; the
            phased transfer of responsibilities to districts; and the
            involvement of nongovernmental organizations and
            community-based organizations for community mobilization.
