Pilot Implementation and Results                                                             September 2015&#13;
Afghanistan â&#128;&#147; Female Youth Employment Initiative (FYEI)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Pilot financing: US$ 2.05 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population and location: 1,300 young women aged 18 to 30 who are high school graduates&#13;
        from Balkhâ&#128;&#153;s urban areas and select districts.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lead ministry: Ministry of Education (MoE).&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agency: MoE, Deputy Ministry of Administration and Finance, through the Educational&#13;
        Quality Improvement Project (EQUIP) arm.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: The project received request forms from 2,800 eligible girls, and selected 1,300&#13;
trainees through a random lottery to begin training in November 2013. The pilot provided job skills training in&#13;
computer and English skills, as well as nutrition and life skills to 1,300 young women aged 18-30. The training&#13;
concluded in May 2014 (a total of seven months) and was followed by six months of employment assistance.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: All courses were appreciated by the beneficiaries, with over 60% of interviewed graduates&#13;
judging them very or extremely useful for finding a job (on a five-point scale). According to FYEI the field office,&#13;
the majority of graduates (62Â±2%) went on to complete a practical internship in an office or school&#13;
environment. Graduates generally found the experience beneficial both in terms of their own personal&#13;
development and their enhanced prospects in the labor market. However, the evaluation of the pilot was&#13;
conducted during the internship phase due to the closing of the project. As such, the evaluation was not able&#13;
to monitor durable labor market outcomes (i.e. graduatesâ&#128;&#153; engagement in stable paid employment beyond the&#13;
project period). Nonetheless, results show 7Â±1% of FYEI graduates holding jobs in the private sector or schools&#13;
at the time of the endline evaluation. These results are low, but they were captured during the internship&#13;
phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Haiti â&#128;&#147; Adolescent Girls Initiative&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Pilot financing: US$ 2 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 1,000 vulnerable young women aged 17 to 21 living in Port-au-Prince.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Partner ministry: Ministry of Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Affairs (MCFDF) and the Secretariat for Vocational and&#13;
        Technical Training (INFP).&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: Between October 2012 and 2014, the Haiti AGI provided technical and soft-skills&#13;
training to over 1,000 young women in two consecutive cohorts of approximately 500 girls each. The project&#13;
offers an integrated approach, combining technical and soft-skills training with financial and psycho-social&#13;
support that puts beneficiaries in the center of a professional and support network. The specific components&#13;
include four to six months of technical vocational training in a trade non-traditional for Haitian women:&#13;
plumbing, construction work, heavy machinery operation, IT, etc. Alongside technical training, young women&#13;
receive training in eight core soft-skills modules which are specifically tailored to the Haitian context. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         1&#13;
&amp;#12;topics include self-esteem, civic engagement and leadership, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based&#13;
violence, professional development and work ethic, disaster preparedness, financial literacy, and living with a&#13;
disability. Following the skills training, the young women participate in a one-month internship in a company&#13;
to further refine their skills and boost their professional experience to facilitate entry into local labor markets.&#13;
Participants also receive a monthly stipend to cover the cost of transportation and food, delivered through&#13;
mobile money (Tcho-Tcho).&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: Impacts measured three months after program completion show that beneficiaries were&#13;
changing the type of work they do, while the share who were participating in income-generating activities, as&#13;
well as their earnings, had not increased. However the project did improve the overall agency of beneficiaries,&#13;
i.e. their capacity to make choices and to pursue desired actions. Participantsâ&#128;&#153; autonomy in their decision&#13;
making and in their mobility increased, as did their standing in relations with their families. The project also led&#13;
to decreases in stress and increased aspirations for the future. Although the impact evaluation did not&#13;
unbundle the intervention, the integrated design of the project and the importance given to soft-skill training&#13;
appear to have been key determinants of those outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Jordan NOW â&#128;&#147; New Work Opportunities for Women (NOW)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Pilot financing: US$ 1.05 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 1,800 young women graduates from eight community colleges.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agency: Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation; Ministry of Higher&#13;
        Education and Scientific Research was also involved in design and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: The pilot launched in December 2010. 373 young women were trained in&#13;
employability skills and 97% of these graduates completed training in November 2010. 301 young graduates&#13;
successfully used job vouchers to secure employment by the time the incentive payments expired in August&#13;
2011. The pilot has now ended.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: Results from the impact evaluation found that while the job voucher was active, female&#13;
graduates with vouchers were 39 % more likely to work than female graduates without vouchers. However,&#13;
this effect was temporary and did not last after the vouchers expired. Outside Central Jordan, girls with&#13;
vouchers continued to have higher employment rates, but this may have come at the expense of those who&#13;
did not have vouchers. Employability skills training showed no statistically significant impact on employment&#13;
outcomes in either the short- or long-term. However training did boost self-confidence and mental well-being&#13;
among the graduates. Insights from the evaluation are being used to illuminate demand-side and regulatory&#13;
constraints to the school-to-work transition of young people in Jordan.&#13;
&#13;
Lao PDR â&#128;&#147; Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Financing: US$ 0.4 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: Youth aged 18 to 35 (majority of whom are female) from three provincial capitals.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agency: Young Entrepreneur Association of Lao PDR (YEAL), National University of Laos&#13;
        and Pakpasak Technical College.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: The pilot project has now ended. Under the project a â&#128;&#152;Market Place Modelâ&#128;&#153; was&#13;
launched in December 2010 to identify strong business ideas and support young entrepreneurs with business&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;skills training, mentorship and seed grants. Nearly 100 young entrepreneurs partook in a 10-day start-up and&#13;
business plan development training. Following the training, more than 85% of participants submitted business&#13;
plans, and 30 finalists were selected to showcase their business ideas at an exhibition. Judged by leaders in&#13;
the private sector, representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and YEAL members, 11&#13;
winners were awarded with a total funding of approximately $50,000. Non-winners were offered SME loans&#13;
and services from commercial and private banks, allowing the AGI participants access to finance should they&#13;
wish to make their business plan a reality.&#13;
&#13;
Under the second project component, two Career Counseling Offices (CCOs) were launchedâ&#128;&#148;at the National&#13;
University of Laos and Pakpasak Technical College in October 2012. The CCOs provide job placement services&#13;
to students and recent graduates who are looking for employment in the private sector. More than 400&#13;
students (80% female) received job preparedness training, and 24 counselors were trained by certified career&#13;
counseling specialist in order to provide a quality advisory to students.&#13;
&#13;
Findings: Project monitoring data shows that 59% of Marketplace Competition participants (more than half of&#13;
whom are female) have started or expanded a small business 12 months after finishing the business skills&#13;
training. 47% of the graduates registered with the Career Counseling Office at the National University of Laos&#13;
(more than a third female) and 44% at Pakpasak Technical College (also more than a third of whom are female)&#13;
reported that they were employed within 12 months of graduation. Through the AGI program, YEAL also&#13;
managed to increase their female members from 3% to 8% within one year.&#13;
&#13;
Liberia â&#128;&#147; Economic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Young Women (EPAG)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Financing: US$ 5.2 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 2,500 young women aged 16 to 27 in Greater Monrovia and Kakata City.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lead ministry and implementing agency: Ministry of Gender and Development (MoGD).&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: 1,131 girls received training in the first round (March 2010-February 2011) and 1,277&#13;
girls were trained in the second round (July 2011-June 2012). 70% of the girls were trained in business&#13;
development skills and 30% were trained in job skills. All girls also received life skills training. Post-training, all&#13;
graduates entered a six-month support period where they were assisted with job searching and placement or&#13;
otherwise supported to start their own businesses.&#13;
&#13;
The pilot phase has ended. EPAG targeted 1,000 adolescent girls and young women in its third round of&#13;
implementation, supported by the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality. 988 girls completed the training (a&#13;
94.7% completion rate). EPAG Round 3 implemented several design changes based on lessons learned from&#13;
the pilot phase, including a condensed training period (four months of training and five months placement),&#13;
increased effort to reach younger and less literate girls, a savings matching scheme to assist with business&#13;
start-up capital, and formalized agreements with the private sector for job skills training and placement. In&#13;
addition, EPAG expanded geographically to reach young women outside greater Monrovia. EPAG recently&#13;
received additional financing through the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality to implement EPAG Round 4,&#13;
which will likely include a small pilot for boys and a pilot to train girls as early childhood development (ECD)&#13;
providers.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: The EPAG impact evaluation provides strong evidence that skills training can be an&#13;
effective policy option for increasing employment among young women in Liberia. Results show that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;program led to a 47 % increase in employment and an 80% increase in average weekly income among project&#13;
beneficiaries, compared to those in the control group. The majority of the employment increase was driven by&#13;
the business skills track. The program also significantly increases the frequency and amount of young womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
savings. Results from an end-line survey show that impacts were sustained more than a year after the&#13;
classroom training ended.&#13;
&#13;
Nepal â&#128;&#147; Adolescent Girls Employment Initiative (AGEI)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Financing: US$ 2.05 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 4,375 young women aged 16 to 24 who are socially discriminated, poor and have&#13;
        low education attainment.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lead ministry: Ministry of Education.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agency: Helvetas/Employment Fund, with 20-25 Training Providers.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: Implementation began in February 2010. Three rounds of training have been&#13;
completed: 810 adolescent girls were trained in 2010; 1,664 in 2011; and 1,936 in 2012. Livelihood trainings&#13;
spanned 39 occupations across 44 districts of Nepal. All trainees also received life skills training and business&#13;
and enterprise skills training for those interested in starting their own businesses. Trainees were assisted with&#13;
job searching and placement or otherwise supported to start their own businesses.&#13;
&#13;
Following on the AGEI pilot, AGEI II was implemented between December 2013 and December 2014. AGEI II&#13;
focused on documenting AGEI lessons and innovations and sharing knowledge and building the capacity of&#13;
other key implementers of skills training in Nepal. In particular, AGEI II worked to build the capacity of the&#13;
Enhancing Vocational Education and Training (EVENT) project, targeting 5,000 women, and the Asian&#13;
Development Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Skills Development Project (approved in June 2013), which has a target of reaching 40%&#13;
women trainees of a total of 45,000 expected trainees.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: One year later, the treatment group had increased their non-farm employment by 14&#13;
percentage points, for an overall gain in employment of 47% relative to the control group. Average monthly&#13;
earnings increased by approximately 45% for the 2010 cohort and 66% for the 2011 cohort. In contrast, limited&#13;
effects were found on empowerment, reproductive health, or household-level outcomes. Employment&#13;
outcomes were marginally better for women, but other outcomes showed no difference between men and&#13;
women.&#13;
&#13;
Rwanda â&#128;&#147; Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Financing: US$ 2.7 million.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 2,000 young women aged 16 to 24 who are literate from two urban and two rural&#13;
        districts of Rwanda.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lead Ministry: Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF).&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agencies: MIGEPROF, Workforce Development Authority (WDA), and Imbuto&#13;
        Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: Component I (Skills Training) was launched on April 2, 2012 in Kigali and the training&#13;
was delivered sequentially among three cohorts. Training of Cohort 1 began in May 2013 and the follow-up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       4&#13;
&amp;#12;ended in May 2014. 621 girls entered Cohort 1 and 597 completed. Due to implementation delays, the second&#13;
and third cohorts were compressed in order to finish before the project closing date in December 2014. The&#13;
second cohort of trainees began the technical training in February 2014 and concluded the project in&#13;
December 2014. 692 girls entered in Cohort 2 and 657 completed. Cohort 3 was trained concurrently with&#13;
Cohort 2 in staggered morning and afternoon classes. Cohort 3 began training in March 2014 and concluded&#13;
the follow-up period in December 2014. 696 girls entered Cohort 3 and 659 completed the project. The overall&#13;
completion rate for the training project was 95%. Participants were trained in food processing, culinary arts,&#13;
arts and crafts, and agribusiness. Girls also received week-long training in life-skills and entrepreneurship.&#13;
Following the classroom training, the girls were supported by trainers, school managers, and business mentors&#13;
to enter jobs or internships in the private sector or form cooperatives to pursue a small business venture.&#13;
&#13;
Under Component II, the project supported eligible adolescent girls and young women (30 per project district)&#13;
aged 15 to 24 who dropped out of school with scholarships to resume formal education. This component was&#13;
administered by Imbuto Foundation and concluded activities in December 2013. Out of the 120 girls who were&#13;
enrolled in school, the project closed with 98 girls remaining in school.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation Results: A non-experimental evaluation revealed a substantial increase in non-farm employment&#13;
among beneficiaries, with the share of girls reporting businesses, wage employment or internships rising from&#13;
50 percent to 75 percent. There was only a modest increase in the share of respondents who reported being&#13;
paid for at least one income generating activity (from 55% to 58%), but amounts earned increased significantly.&#13;
By the end of the program, respondents were more likely to be members of savings groups (from 27% to 81%),&#13;
to have saved recently (from 18% to 37%), and to have saved larger amounts (from RwF 7,050 to RwF 20,086).&#13;
The impact of the AGI project on beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; lives went beyond the economic realm; respondents reported&#13;
having larger social networks, higher life satisfaction, and greater entrepreneurial self-confidence. Notably&#13;
however, reports of gender-based violence increased considerably, with a larger share of respondents&#13;
indicating that they experienced sexual harassment at least once in their lifetimes (25% to 43%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan â&#128;&#147; Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI)&#13;
Project Details:&#13;
    ï&#130;· Financing: US$ 1.9 million&#13;
    ï&#130;· Target population: 3,000 young women age 15 to 24 from four states.&#13;
    ï&#130;· Lead Ministry: Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Development&#13;
    ï&#130;· Implementing agency: BRAC South Sudan&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Update: 100 adolescent clubs, staffed with 100 Adolescent Leaders, have been established in&#13;
five counties in four states of South Sudan. To date 1,659 club members have received livelihood training.&#13;
About 60% of members have received agriculture training; other fields include poultry farming, goat rearing,&#13;
small business, tailoring, salon, catering and carpentry. Through BRACâ&#128;&#153;s cascade model of training, all 3,000&#13;
participating girls have received life skills and financial literacy training. BRAC also provided savings and credit&#13;
services to qualified girls. So far, BRAC has provided loans to 140 members to support their business&#13;
development plans. The pilot phase has ended; BRAC is committed to maintaining the adolescent clubs&#13;
established under the AGI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;Emerging Findings: Anecdotal evidence suggests that AGI participants show high levels of engagement and&#13;
confidence, reflected in increased awareness of such issues as protection against rape, early pregnancy,&#13;
contraception and family planning in general, and increased knowledge and awareness of HIV/AIDs. Project&#13;
implementers report that family members and communities have increased their respect for adolescent girls&#13;
as they find their daughters more knowledgeable and able to earn money to support family expenses. The&#13;
endline survey for the impact evaluation was completed and analysis of the results is underway. The results&#13;
are expected by December 2015.&#13;
