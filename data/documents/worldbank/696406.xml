REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
TREASURY MODERNIZATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    In its four years of independence, Kazakstan has made substantial progress toward creating&#13;
a market economy and achieving macroeconomic stability. Maintenance of macroeconomic stability&#13;
requires, among other things, policies that will hold the fiscal deficit to manageable levels.&#13;
Restraining the fiscal deficit will depend upon sound strategy and management on both the revenue&#13;
and expenditure sides of the budget.&#13;
2.    To boost revenues, a taxation policy has been drafted and a new streamlined tax code has&#13;
been designed and should be adopted by Parliament in 1995. An International Monetary Fund (IMF)&#13;
Tax Administration Advisor has been providing technical assistance in the development of software&#13;
for the tax administration system. This will be accompanied by measures to strengthen the Tax&#13;
Inspection Service, supported by United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-&#13;
financed technical assistance.&#13;
3.    Much work, however, remains to be done on government expenditure management and&#13;
control. Establishing a treasury system in the Treasury Department (TD) within the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) has been given high priority by the government and is a critical requirement for&#13;
sound management of public finances. Although the proposed treasury system would have linkages&#13;
with other government financial operations, specifically revenue operations, the government has&#13;
decided to address tax administration separately. Substantial work has already been undertaken in&#13;
the area of tax reform with funding from other donors. The World Bank's financing of the proposed&#13;
treasury modernization project to enhance government expenditure management and control is&#13;
appropriate and timely.&#13;
4.    A TD was formally established in the MOF by Presidential decree on January 27, 1994 with&#13;
the principal aim of managing the government expenditures, assets and liabilities. The Deputy&#13;
Minister of Finance was appointed as the Director of the TD. The TD has a current staff of 28 (&#13;
which will be 56 when fully established) and plans to administer a comprehensive and reliable&#13;
financial information system for the day-to-day management of government expenditures. To achieve&#13;
this, the TD has been assigned a number of responsibilities, including regular analysis, reporting on&#13;
the execution of the budget; cash and debt management; accounting for government financial&#13;
operations; and treasury system computerization. The management of both domestic and external&#13;
debt will be an integral function of the TD; a branch of the Cash Management Division of the TD&#13;
will have the responsibility of external debt management and all the existing external management&#13;
functions will be incorporated in this branch unit. The 1995 program of the TD included establishing&#13;
regional treasury units which will take over budget execution and primary accounting responsibilities&#13;
from the National Bank of Kazakstan (NBK), and introduction of the required reforms to centralize&#13;
fiscal monitoring and control functions in the MOF.&#13;
5.    Organizational development of the TD is only the first step in establishing an efficient&#13;
treasury system. Basic banking and accounting arrangements will have to be redesigned to support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
treasury functions and new procedures, developed to support the new revenue and expenditure&#13;
classification and to ensure that the TD plays an effective role in controlling government&#13;
expenditures. The government has decided to establish a computerized treasury system in a planned&#13;
and phased program to facilitate management of government expenditures and has requested World&#13;
Bank 's financing for its implementation.&#13;
II. OVERVIEW OF A TREASURY SYSTEM FOR KAZAKSTAN&#13;
Background&#13;
6.    Government treasury management is defined as a set of rules, practices, and procedures with&#13;
the aim of distributing funds, accounting for their use, producing periodic financial reports and&#13;
making cash resources of the government more productive and the borrowing of funds less expensive.&#13;
The advantages of good treasury management, principles of effective cash management and&#13;
institutional and organizational aspects of treasury systems are discussed in Annex 1.&#13;
7.    The current public expenditure management processes in Kazakstan largely reflect the&#13;
centrally-planned economic system inherited from the time of the former Soviet Union (FSU). The&#13;
role of the fiscal machinery in that system was in the elaboration and implementation of successive&#13;
National Economic Plans. In that context, the preparation of the annual budget was the comrnmon&#13;
responsibility of the central planning authority (initially GOSPLAN, subsequently the State Economic&#13;
Committee). The demise of the planning system in Kazakstan caused a breakdown in budget&#13;
programming and control mechanisms. The collapse of the unifying authority of the Party has left&#13;
local administrations with a degree of financial autonomy incommensurate with the accountability to&#13;
which they are subject. The role of the MOF in budget execution process became marginal, spending&#13;
units committed expenditures at their discretion, and the NBK performed payment/public&#13;
accounting/cash management functions. The MOF only controlled the release of funds to spending&#13;
units' accounts, and even that only at the central level. In this situation the MOF was mainly&#13;
responsible for reconciling information received from the NBK, ministries, regions and districts and&#13;
producing the statement of monthly outcome for the republican budget. Reports from regions&#13;
(incorporating details from districts) were forwarded to the MOF every month for consolidation into&#13;
the outcome of local budgets. The republican and local figures were then combined to produce a&#13;
monthly statement for the State. At all these stages, information was compiled manually with very&#13;
little recourse to automation. Little information was generated internally by the MOF, which&#13;
operated primarily as a consolidating agency with very limited control over budget execution.&#13;
8.    Cash management was also largely nonexistent. Very little capacity existed to monitor daily&#13;
cash flows in government accounts, cash resources were not used efficiently and expenditure estimates&#13;
were based on norms, not realistically related to likely revenues. Reliable and comprehensive&#13;
accounting information was not available on a timely basis. Responsibilities for fiscal matters appear&#13;
to be diffused amnong a number of different entities within the government. Inappropriate budget&#13;
classifications did not allow meaningful assessment of fiscal and economic data, which diminished&#13;
budgetary control.&#13;
9.    Successive IMF technical assistance missions have, first, identified the institutional and&#13;
conceptual weaknesses in the public expenditure management system, and, second, proposed a series&#13;
of reforms which the government has accepted and, with Fund and other external assistance, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
nearing completion of implementing many critical components. The major weaknesses could be&#13;
sunmarized as follows:&#13;
diffusion of responsibilities for fiscal matters among a number of different entities&#13;
within the government in addition to the MOF;&#13;
inappropriate budget classifications, based on productive and nonproductive&#13;
categories which did not allow meaningful budget monitoring;&#13;
an inappropriate legal framework for budget preparation, approval, implementation&#13;
and reporting;&#13;
lack of a macroeconomic framework necessary for formulation of the budget and&#13;
elaboration of revenue and expenditure projections;&#13;
lack of reliable and comprehensive accounting information available on a timely&#13;
basis; and&#13;
lack of essential cash and debt management capabilities; and the appropriate legal&#13;
framework for borrowing, recording and for controlling loan arrangements and&#13;
government guarantees.&#13;
Reforms to Date&#13;
10.      Overcoming the problems in the then existing fiscal system required adoption of a number&#13;
of reforms. Measures for institutional strengthening, adoption of the required legal and regulatory&#13;
framework, subjecting central and local administrations to the financial authority of the MOF,&#13;
introducing a new budget law capable of proper budget programming and control, introducing public&#13;
debt laws and a computerized debt management system, are among the reforms which are now largely&#13;
implemented. These reforms, which accompanied the establishment of a Treasury system, can be&#13;
sunmmarized as follows:&#13;
the republican budget has been reclassified to conform with Government Finance&#13;
Statistics (GFS) methodology and to be more suitable for economic analysis. The&#13;
classification system also addresses organization arrangements and is therefore&#13;
suitable for budget preparation, parliamentary appropriation and for computerized&#13;
budget execution. The new classification has been adopted by the government&#13;
and has been in use in Ministries and agencies since April 1, 1996;&#13;
a new budget system law has been drafted with assistance from a U.S. Treasury&#13;
Budget Advisor and substantial input from the IMF Treasury Advisor. It is in&#13;
the final stages of government consideration; and&#13;
internal debt management operations have been consolidated within the recently&#13;
formed Treasury Department (TD)--see below--and, with assistance from&#13;
USAID, the UNCTAD Debt Management and Financial Analysis System&#13;
(DMFAS) is being installed for control and reporting purposes;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
funds are released periodically by the TD, based on cash flow forecasts and&#13;
expenditure plans of Ministries. Funds are further distributed by Ministries to&#13;
spending units.&#13;
11.       The development of comprehensive accounting information and a systematic approach to&#13;
budget implementation and cash management is best carried out through an integrated computerized&#13;
treasury system operated through a Treasury Department. With IMF assistance, the Government has&#13;
developed an integrated strategy, covering three main elements to introduce the computerized treasury&#13;
system. These elements are: (i) centralizing financial operations in a single bank account--a Treasury&#13;
Single Account (TSA); (ii) establishing a Treasury Ledger System (TLS); and (iii) computerizing the&#13;
TLS for the processing of payments and receipts. To date the single account has been established&#13;
in the National Bank of Kazakstan. A TD was formally established in the MOF by a Presidential&#13;
decree on January 27, 1994 with the principal aim of managing the government expenditures, assets&#13;
and liabilities. The Deputy Minister of Finance was appointed as the Director of the TD. The TD&#13;
has been assigned a number of responsibilities, including regular analysis, reporting and execution&#13;
of the budget; cash and debt management; accounting for government financial operations; and&#13;
treasury system computerization. As stated earlier, the management of domestic debt is now an&#13;
integral function of the TD.&#13;
Organizationally the TD has the following six major divisions:&#13;
(a) the Financial Accounting and Analysis Division is responsible for drawing up&#13;
monthly, quarterly, and annual reports on revenues and expenditures of the&#13;
Republican Budget.&#13;
(b) the Republican Budget Execution Division is responsible for assigning revenues and&#13;
expenditure under the Republican Budget, and for determining expenditure&#13;
requirements of ministries and spending units.&#13;
(c) the Monetary Credit Policy Division.&#13;
(d) the Cash and State Debts Division is responsible for cash management, internal and&#13;
external debt management, control of government guarantees, issue of securities and&#13;
interaction with the NBK.&#13;
(e) the Informatics Division, and&#13;
(f) the Supervision of the Budget Cash Execution Division which is responsible for&#13;
supervision of the recently taken over NBK cash settlement centers.&#13;
12.       Other divisions are responsible for development of methodological procedures and&#13;
financial statistics and analysis.&#13;
13.       The proposed project, to fully design and computerize the treasury system, is the logical&#13;
conclusion and important final step in implementing the series of wide ranging Public Expenditure&#13;
Management (PEM) reforms undertaken by the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Impementation of Computerized Treasury System&#13;
14.       The MOF is in the process of implementing many of the recommendations of the IMF&#13;
related to treasury system implementation. The detailed definition and computerization of the&#13;
treasury system, the subject of this loan, is a key element in the overall reform process, and attracts&#13;
a high priority from the government perspective because of the need to ensure sound management&#13;
of public finances.&#13;
15.       As mentioned above, with IMF assistance, the government has developed an integrated&#13;
strategy, covering three elements, to introduce the computerized treasury system. These elements&#13;
are: (i) centralizing financial operations in a single bank account - a Treasury Single Account (TSA);&#13;
(ii) establishing a Treasury Ledger System (TLS); and (iii) designing and operating the&#13;
computerization of the TLS and the processing of payments and receipts. The strategy calls for&#13;
phased introduction of the system in three main stages: (i) project preparation (1994-96); (ii)&#13;
implementation of a pilot automation system covering a group of ministries and selected Regional&#13;
Treasury Units (RTU) (1996-97); and (iii) replication of the pilot system across all ministries, RTUs&#13;
and District Treasury Units (DTU) (1998-1999). Each stage would start upon substantial completion&#13;
of the preceding stage, determined by MOF and World Bank acceptance of the deliverables listed for&#13;
that stage. A T reasury Advisor has been appointed by the IMF to work closely with TD staff and&#13;
the selected consulting firm, financed under the PPF, to assist the TD in design and preparation of&#13;
the project. Detailed description of the functional design of the treasury system the Government of&#13;
Kazakstan plans to implement, and the hardware and software strategy for implementing the treasury&#13;
system is included in Annex 1.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objective&#13;
16.       The project's overall aim is to support the new TD in establishing a treasury system: (i)&#13;
that provides comprehensive, reliable and timely financial management information; and (ii) helps&#13;
manage government expenditure effectively. To achieve this aim, the project sets three specific&#13;
objectives: (i) prepare a detailed functional design for the treasury system and develop related&#13;
procedures; (ii) provide and install the computer resources to implement the treasury system; and (iii)&#13;
ensure that local staff can operate and maintain the system effectively.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
17.       The project consists of the following components:&#13;
(a)    Design of the Computerized Treasury System. This component consists of:    (i)&#13;
preparing a detailed functional design for the treasury system and developing related&#13;
procedures and manuals; (ii) examining available software alternatives; (iii) developing&#13;
hardware and software specifications for the technology platform needed to establish the&#13;
system and assist in their procurement; and (iv) formulating a programn to train the TD&#13;
and other related staff and upgrading the Government's in-house technical capacity to&#13;
operate and maintain the system. A consultant firm was selected by the Government to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
carry out this task. A Project Preparation Facility in the amount of US$1 million was&#13;
approved on July 14, 1994 to finance this work;&#13;
(b)    Pilot System Computerization. Based on the work carried out under component (a),&#13;
application software would be designed and procured to test and implement the full&#13;
functionality of the Treasury System at a few designated sites. Computer hardware&#13;
system and software would be procured to implement the pilot at the sites. At this stage,&#13;
user manuals, training materials and technical documentation will be finalized and the&#13;
local staff will be trained to operate and maintain the system.&#13;
(c)    Full Implementation of the Computerized System. Based on the finalized system under&#13;
component (b), computer hardware and standard software will be procured and installed&#13;
for the rest of the treasury system. A Government wide training program will be&#13;
implemented simultaneously for operating and maintaining the system.&#13;
Status of Preparation&#13;
18.       Detailed Functional Design. System designs and functional specification for payroll,&#13;
commitment accounting, revenue accounting, cash management, fixed asset control, general ledger&#13;
and chart of accounts (comprising a majority of the functions) have been completed by the consultants&#13;
and approved by the Government&#13;
19.       Software Alternatives. Investigation of available off the shelf software packages that&#13;
meet the functional requirements of the treasury system has been started. While conducting a search&#13;
for software packages the consultants will ensure that: (a) the software packages provide the required&#13;
functionality; (b) it is possible to obtain and install upgrades and/or changes to the packages in&#13;
Kazakstan as they become available; (c) the vendor for the package provides customization assistance&#13;
as may be required or alternatively the package source code is available for making changes as may&#13;
be required; (d) the costs associated with any customization are identified clearly in the total cost; (e)&#13;
the package runs on a range of hardware and operating software which is compliant with the&#13;
hardware and software strategy proposed for the treasury system; (f) adequate documentation is&#13;
available to enable package installation and use, and (g) licensing arrangements clearly specify the&#13;
liability for use of the package at multiple sites in Kazakstan.&#13;
20.       In case it is not found feasible to purchase an off the shelf package to satisfy the&#13;
requirements of the treasury system, the consultants will develop a plan for the design and&#13;
development of the application systems. In this case, the consultants will also extend the functional&#13;
analysis performed above and develop the systems and program specifications for the various&#13;
modules of the treasury and related systems. These would then be used as the basis for the&#13;
contracting (or in-house development) of the application software.&#13;
21.       Development of hardware and software specifications and acquisition of hardware&#13;
and software. Hardware and software specifications are being completed by the consultants and&#13;
progress was reviewed with the Government during the appraisal. The bidding document for the&#13;
procurement of hardware and software for the pilot phase implementation is also under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.       Development/upgrading the MOF data processing organization. The government will&#13;
require the development/upgrading of its in-house data processing facilities to maintain and operate&#13;
the treasury and associated systems developed as part of this project. The MOF computer department&#13;
has a staff of competent analysts and programmers. A team of about 8-10 staff from this center will&#13;
be designated by the government to work along with the consultants. This staff will need to be&#13;
involved with all tasks associated with systems design, software development, installation and&#13;
operation. In case one or more software packages are selected to satisfy the requirements of the&#13;
treasury system, the staff will need to be trained in their use and maintenance. In case in-house&#13;
development is required, staff will be associated with the in-house development of the system or the&#13;
management of the contractors who have been selected to carry out the development.&#13;
23.       The consultants will analyze the existing MOF's EDP resources and develop a plan to&#13;
upgrade the data processing organization. This would include assisting the TD in developing a&#13;
training program for its staff including specialized training in the use of the various tools such as&#13;
operating systems and DBMSs application development facilities, and more general training in EDP&#13;
project management, maintenance and provision of end user support and training for a country wide&#13;
system treasury system.&#13;
Implementation Strategy&#13;
24.       Under project preparation, significant progress has been made to prepare for project&#13;
implementation. Detailed function for the treasury system has been completed by consultants and&#13;
approved by the TD. Bidding documents for procurement of pilot hardware and software are being&#13;
completed and progress was reviewed during appraisal. Broad outline of a training program has been&#13;
drawn-up and was reviewed with the Government during appraisal. Search for available software&#13;
alternatives has also begun. By loan effectiveness, most of the preparatory work should be&#13;
completed. The first phase of implementation would focus mainly on finalizing the training plan and&#13;
procedures and manuals for the new system.&#13;
25.       The implementation of the project is divided into three phases: completion of the&#13;
functional design of the system to be tested (as described in paragraph 18); a pilot phase to procure&#13;
and test the system; followed by implementation of the full system. Accordingly, the hardware and&#13;
standard software packages to be purchased under the project will be divided into two phases. The&#13;
pilot phase would implement the application systems and installation of new hardware at the central&#13;
Treasury, two of the central spending units (sector ministries), two oblasts and some associated&#13;
rayons to thoroughly test the features and functionality of the system, the integration between the first&#13;
and second level packages, and work out the data migration strategy. Hardware procurement at this&#13;
stage will be limited to the pilot project requirement. The bid documents for the pilot phase has been&#13;
prepared and submitted to the Bank for review prior to Board presentation.&#13;
26.       Based on the modifications made during the pilot phase, hardware will be procured for&#13;
the full implementation phase. Simultaneously, training of local staff would be conducted to carry&#13;
out the replication and subsequent operation and maintenance of the system.  Prior to the&#13;
commencement of the full implementation phase, a Mid-Term Review will be carried out with the&#13;
Government to precisely define the hardware and standard software packages to be procured, their&#13;
costs, and the implementation schedule for replicating the system country-wide. Prior to the Mid-&#13;
Term Review, the draft bid documents for the full implementation phase will be prepared and&#13;
submitted to the Bank for review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
27.       Pilot phase computerization. The pilot phase would implement the application systems&#13;
and install new hardware at the central Treasury, two central spending units (sector ministries), two&#13;
oblasts and some rayons to thoroughly test the features and functionality of the systems, the&#13;
integration between the first and second level packages, and work out the data migration strategy.&#13;
Hardware procurement at this stage will be limited to the pilot phase requirement. Once the pilot&#13;
phase has been successfully completed, additional hardware and licenses for application systems&#13;
would be procured prior to the system being implemented at other oblasts and rayons. Deliverables&#13;
for pilot phase include:&#13;
(i)    installation and testing of the hardware and software;&#13;
(ii)   ensuring that the hardware and software supplied by the selected vendors meets the&#13;
design specifications;&#13;
(iii)   ensuring that tested modules for the full treasury system, including the modules that will&#13;
be implemented at the central TD, regional and district units, and the ministries and&#13;
subordinate spending units, are fully functional;&#13;
(iv)   preparation of the user manuals and other technical documentation to enable the complete&#13;
operation of the full treasury system;&#13;
(v)    preparation of the training manuals for end users; and&#13;
(vi)   design and implementation of training courses for sufficient number of local staff to a&#13;
level which will enable them to operate and maintain the treasury system, and to provide&#13;
the necessary end user support.&#13;
28.       Project full implementation phase. Based on the assessment made during the pilot&#13;
phase, hardware will be procured for the full implementation phase. Simultaneously, training of local&#13;
staff would be conducted to carry out the replication and subsequent operation and maintenance of&#13;
the system. Prior to the commencement of the full implementation phase, a Mid-Term Review will&#13;
be carried out with the Government to precisely define the hardware and standard software packages&#13;
to be procured, their costs, and the implementation schedule for replicating the system country wide.&#13;
Deliverables for this phase would include:&#13;
(i)    preparation of a replication plan and schedule for the implementation of the computerized&#13;
treasury system;&#13;
(ii)   preparation of a detailed check list of the tasks that should be undertaken for replication&#13;
of the system at the treasury regions and districts;&#13;
(iii)   confirmation by the hardware and software vendors that the first two replications are fully&#13;
operational; and&#13;
(iv)   training of sufficient local staff capable of carrying out subsequent replications.&#13;
29.       Treasury system training. The training strategy aims to develop a cadre of professionals&#13;
able to develop and operate the treasury system, and to strengthen commitment to the reform process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
By matching the investment in systems with a parallel investment in people, the full benefits of the&#13;
system can be achieved. Given the extensive training needs identified, the chosen modality is a&#13;
cascade approach, the essential aim being to train limited numbers of key people who will then train&#13;
much larger numbers of subordinates. Two main groups of training skills are needed:&#13;
(i)    accounting, financial management and auditing;&#13;
(ii)   informnation technology and software applications.&#13;
30.      The following target groups have been identified: system developers and administrators,&#13;
applications managers, personnel responsible for transaction processing, end-users, personnel of the&#13;
budget bank, senior managers, accountants and government auditors.&#13;
31.        For successful implementation of the project, a separate unit is required for treasury&#13;
training, appropriately linked with the department for personnel issues and educational institutions&#13;
of the Ministry of Finance. The unit, with technical assistance from the project, would have the&#13;
general responsibility for creating and implementing an annual training program for the Treasury&#13;
Department, setting out the courses to be designed and delivered, their objectives and duration,&#13;
numbers to be trained, the locations for training and the necessary inputs from various sources. The&#13;
plan would be approved by the Deputy Minister of Finance annually.&#13;
32.         The main training modules would be: elements of govermnent accounting, financial&#13;
management, internal control and internal audit; overview of the treasury system (appreciation&#13;
course); financial procedures; transactions processing for budget execution; information technology;&#13;
application systems; site management procedures; and courses for end-users. The above would be&#13;
designed as permanent courses to run regularly after completion of the project. Training would be&#13;
provided principally by the training unit of the Treasury Department with help from other divisions,&#13;
and from selected commercial firms and training institutions.&#13;
33.         In association with the September 1996 project launch (see above), the first formal&#13;
training seminar will be held. During implementation, further workshops will be organized for&#13;
managers, senior financial staff, accountants and trainers in line ministries, oblasts, audit bodies and&#13;
training institutions. The training strategy and program and the Project launch are further described&#13;
in Annex 2.&#13;

IV. PROJECT FINANCING, COSTS, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
34. Project costs and Financing. Total project costs are estimated to amount to US$21.7 million,&#13;
of which foreign exchange costs are calculated at US$19.3 million, or 89% of the total. Local costs&#13;
have been estimated on the basis of current and foreseeable salary and accommodation needs. Costs&#13;
for various components have been estimated in November 1995 using the experience of other World&#13;
Bank projects in the region, similar activities in neighboring countries and detailed input from various&#13;
counterparts. The estimates include physical contingency amounting to US$0.92 million, which is&#13;
comprised of: (i) 5 percent of the cost of computer hardware and related equipment procurement; (ii)&#13;
15 percent of the cost of application software; and, (iii) 15 % of the cost of training. All equipment,&#13;
installation, training and foreign consultant costs have been estimated net of taxes and duties. The&#13;
consultants which have been engaged by the Government to assist in the project preparation are also&#13;
expected to continue to assist during the implementation phase (per contract). US$1 million of the&#13;
$1.50 million is being financed under the PPF and the remaining contract amount will be financed&#13;
by the project loan.&#13;
35.      The main financial contribution of the Government, equivalent to 27 percent of total&#13;
project cost, would be the incremental staffing cost for the new computerized treasury system;&#13;
associated hardware and software maintenance costs for the outer years of the project (years four and&#13;
five); other recurrent expenditure costs associated with operating the new treasury system, including&#13;
computer supplies and communication charges; for the period covering project implementation (July&#13;
1996 to December 2000). The Government financial contribution totals US$5.9 million. The Bank&#13;
would thus finance 82 percent of foreign exchange costs and 73 percent of total project costs. The&#13;
Project Cost and Financing Plan is summarized in Schedule A.&#13;
36.      Institutional Arrangements for Project Coordination and Implementation. The&#13;
project will be implemented over a 4-year period in accordance with the project description in para.&#13;
17 and the implementation plan in Schedule D. Responsibility for project coordination and&#13;
implementation will be vested in the Deputy Minister for Finance, head of the Treasury.&#13;
37.      Project Implementation. To assist the Deputy Minister for Finance in the day-to-day&#13;
implementation and coordination of the project, a working group comprising six senior staff, five&#13;
from the TD and one from the Computer Center has been established. This working group has been&#13;
supervising the preparation of the project as well as the detailed work being produced by the project&#13;
consultants for the past six months. The quality of their supervision and inputs have been extremely&#13;
high.&#13;
38.      The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of Committee on Utilization of Foreign Capital&#13;
(CUFC) under the Ministry of Finance will review and clear all procurement documents. PIU,&#13;
established in mid 1993 to handle several World Bank loans, has operated satisfactorily and is now&#13;
managing implementation of three World Bank projects and a number of other projects funded by&#13;
other donors. To help Government initiate the project, the Bank and the IMF will organize a project&#13;
launch workshop, after Loan approval, at which a team comprising the task manager, IMF Fiscal&#13;
Affairs staff and management, and computer specialist will fully review the implementation&#13;
procedures and requirements. Bi-annual supervision missions would follow, with a mid-term review&#13;
in March 1998 (18 months after effectiveness) when the Government is expected to launch the full&#13;
scale implementation of the computerized treasury system. The Supervision Plan is shown in&#13;
Schedule F, the inputs process, output and impact indicators are presented in Schedule G.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
39.       Procurement. Under this Loan, provision is made for computer hardware and software,&#13;
training and consultant services to be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants" (the Consultant Guidelines) published by the Bank in August 1981 and "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (the Procurement Guidelines) published by the&#13;
Bank in January 1995. Project components, estimated costs and procurement arrangements are set&#13;
out in detail in Schedule E.&#13;
40.       International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Procurement of goods for all contracts over&#13;
US$300,00 would be awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) following the Bank's&#13;
guidelines and the use of the Bank's standard bidding documents. These contracts are expected in&#13;
aggregate to amount to US$10.18 million.  To ensure compliance with the Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines, all contracts awarded through ICB, will be subject to prior Bank review. General&#13;
Procurement Notice for the project will appear in the July 1996 edition of the Development Business&#13;
Forum.&#13;
41.      International Shopping (IS). For goods below contract value of $300,000, with an&#13;
expected aggregate amount of US$1.0 million, procurement will be undertaken through International&#13;
Shopping {IS) with at least three bids from three member countries in accordance with Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
42.       National Shopping (NS). Minor sundry items, such as small lots of information and&#13;
office equipment, not exceeding US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000&#13;
equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of prudent national shopping by comparing price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers, in accordance with Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
43.       Direct Contracting (DC). Goods and technical licenses which the Bank agrees: (i) are&#13;
of proprietary nature; or (ii) need to be compatible with other installed equipment, may be procured&#13;
through direct negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on the terms and conditions&#13;
acceptab'e to the Bank. Such items include contracts for intellectual property such as books, technical&#13;
journals, training materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software, including annual&#13;
upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights, translation and reprinting rights for training&#13;
materials, are estimated to cost under US$500,000 equivalent in the aggregate.&#13;
44.      Implementation Consultants. The main set of technical assistance for the project has&#13;
been already been contracted with financing being provided by a Project Preparation Facility.&#13;
Qualified firms were invited to submit proposals for foreign technical assistance in accordance with&#13;
the Consultant Guidelines. The contract was awarded to KPMG Barents group for a total value of&#13;
US$1.5 million. US$1.0 million of this contract is covered by PPF, and the remaining US$0.5&#13;
million will be covered from the consultancies and training component. An amount of $0.36 million&#13;
has been set aside for possible additional assistance required during implementation. According to the&#13;
terms of reference and the contract, Barents group will assist the Government in the implementation&#13;
of the project.&#13;
45.       For other consultancies that may be required, selection of the consulting firns for the&#13;
provision of services will be carried out following the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency," published by the Bank in August 1981.&#13;
To suumerize, following are the main components to be financed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(i)   funding of the implementation consultants (US$860,000);&#13;
(ii)   advisory services to the TD, selected based on a short-list of individual consultants&#13;
(US$410,000);&#13;
(iii)  two or three contracts selected through proposals submitted by short-list of consultants&#13;
for: (a) training of Government staff on computer operation and maintenance; and (b)&#13;
national and local seminars on the treasury system (aggregate of US$930,000); and&#13;
(iv)   technical studies related to the treasury (US$380,000).&#13;
46.       Bank Review. For goods, the Bank shall review the Borrower's procurement decisions&#13;
and procedures in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Procurement Guidelines. In particular: (i) each&#13;
contract estimated to cost $300,000 or more; (ii) the first two contracts under each project component&#13;
estimated to cost US$100,000 or more; and (iii) all direct contracts; shall be subject to prior review,&#13;
in accordance with paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 of the Procurement Guidelines. Other goods contracts&#13;
costing US$50,000 or more shall be subject to post review in accordance with paragraph 4 of the&#13;
Appendix 1 of the Procurement Guidelines. For technical assistance contracts, the applicable review&#13;
procedures would be followed as per the Consultant Guidelines. However, for technical assistance&#13;
contracts under $50,000, the Bank will require prior review of only the terms of reference and short-&#13;
list of potential consultants.&#13;
47.       Procurement Monitoring. Information on procurement would be collected and recorded&#13;
to provide: (i) prompt reporting of contract awards by the Borrower; (ii) full quarterly reports to the&#13;
Bank; and (iii) changes in procurement schedules, including advertising, bidding, contract awards and&#13;
completion dates.&#13;
48.       Disbursements. The proposed loan would finance: (i) 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
expenditures of imported goods, up to 100 percent of the local expenditures (ex-factory costs), and&#13;
up to 75 percent of the expenditures for other items procured locally; (ii) 100 percent of expenditures&#13;
of consultants services (net of taxes), and training; and (iii) the refinancing of the PPF. It is&#13;
projected that US$3.27 million would be disbursed in FY97, US$6.24 million in FY98, and US$6.25&#13;
million in FY99. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999, and the loan&#13;
closing is expected on June 30, 2000. Disbursements would be made against the Statement of&#13;
Expenditure for contracts for Goods upto $300,000 equivalent and consultant (individual $50,000&#13;
equiv. and firms $100,000 equiv.) for which detailed documents evidencing expenditures will be&#13;
reviewed by Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and made available for the required audit as well as&#13;
to Bank supervision missions. Disbursements against contracts for good exceeding this threshold&#13;
would be made against normal documentation.&#13;
49.       Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US&#13;
dollars in a commercial bank. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account would be limited to US$100,000. However, when the aggregate disbursement under&#13;
the loan have reached the level of $1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Replenishment applicatiions should be submitted at least every three months, and must include&#13;
reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
50.       Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A PPF was approved and became effective on July&#13;
23, 1994 to finance the services of a qualified consulting firm to assist the TD to immediately proceed&#13;
with the preparation of a detailed functional design for the treasury system and with the development&#13;
of related computer hardware and software specifications. The PPF will be repaid immediately upon&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
51.       Coordination with the IMF. This project has been prepared jointly with the IMF and&#13;
this joint effort will continue under project implementation. During project implementation, the Bank&#13;
would retain full responsibility over the supervision of system design and implementation,&#13;
procurement and disbursement. The IMF will be responsible for supervising the implementation of&#13;
the overall public expenditure management reform program and specifically the substantive aspects&#13;
of the treasury system.&#13;
V. PROJECT ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL REPORTING AND AUDITING&#13;
52.       Accounting. The Borrower would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the&#13;
funds provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring&#13;
that audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. The TD would establish&#13;
an appropriate accounting system to enable information on the proper receipts and use of the funds&#13;
provided in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Accounting for all Special Account transactions&#13;
and all other project accounts will be maintained in accordance with practices and standards&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, with the objective of timely and accurate accounting for all transactions&#13;
under the Loan.&#13;
53.       Financial Reporting. The financial reporting would comprise statements of receipts and&#13;
payments for the reporting period from the beginning of the Loan operation. The reporting would&#13;
be in accordance with the disbursements classified and reported by the expenditures categories agreed&#13;
with the Borrower and specified in the legal documents. The TD would submit quarterly financial&#13;
progress reports, including separate report of the Special Account. A Project Completion Report&#13;
would be submitted to the Bank by the TD promptly after the completion of the operation, and in any&#13;
event not later than six months after the Loan closing date.&#13;
54.       Auditing. The financial statements and reports on the Loan should be submitted in&#13;
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The criteria for selecting auditors would be as follows: (i) impartial and independent from the entity&#13;
to be audited; (ii) well established and reputable; (iii) experienced in the type of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
assignment to be undertaken; and (iv) able to fulfill the terms of reference required within the&#13;
specified timetable.&#13;
VI. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
55.       This project, providing computer hardware and software, training and technical assistance,&#13;
will have no negative enviromnental impact and has therefore been placed within category C under&#13;
the Operational Directive 4.01 on Environmental Assessments.&#13;
VII. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
56.       The proposed project would lead to significant financial and economic benefits to the&#13;
country. By developing the central treasury system and optimizing the budgeting process and debt&#13;
management, the project would contribute to reducing Government borrowing costs. Tools and skills&#13;
developed under the project would enable access to timely, accurate and consistent financial&#13;
information to improve resource planning, cash management, budgeting, and public expenditure&#13;
management and control. Improvements in the public finance management reform being undertaken&#13;
by the IMF would promote the capacity to properly formulate and execute fiscal policies. The&#13;
consolidation of various information databases, consistency in the classification of expenditure items,&#13;
and an effective system to control expenditure and monitor cash flows would enhance transparency&#13;
and accountability in the fiscal processes.&#13;
57.       During the introduction of an improved system of public finance, it may be difficult to&#13;
overcome entrenched positions, attitudes and the vested interests of bureaucrats, who have benefited&#13;
from financial uncertainties and lack of control. The Presidential decree setting up the Treasury, the&#13;
introduction of the legal framework for Government financial management, and Presidential decree&#13;
requiring adoption of a new budget classification system and its application for preparing the fiscal&#13;
1996 budget have, however, significantly reduced these risks.&#13;
58.       More specific risks relate to the nature of the proposed technological changes and the&#13;
need for adequate technical expertise. To ameliorate these risks, the project has provided for: (i)&#13;
preparation and approval of the functional design and hardware configuration by expert consultants&#13;
as part of project preparation; (ii) phasing the implementation into a pilot and full implementation;&#13;
(iv) cominued employment of expert consultants during the pilot and early phases of systems&#13;
replication and the close association of local specialists during these phases; and (iv) a significant&#13;
t.aining component included in the project.&#13;

The Development and Implementation&#13;
of the Government Financal&#13;
Management Information System&#13;
The Treasury System&#13;
1.           Iln the process of developing a TLS and an associated TSA, it is important to&#13;
recognize the interconnection and interdependence of all aspects of Public Expenditure&#13;
Management(PEM). Budget execution cannot be viewed in isolation, but must be linked to budget&#13;
preparation, budget approval, and cash and debt management. However, the TLS serves as the key&#13;
element within the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), and is the&#13;
central component of the system, upon which other elements of the public expenditure process can be&#13;
built. This modular approach to PEM functions is illustrated in Chart 1. The budget implementation&#13;
approach presented in this chart is broadly consistent with, and will be linked to, the functions&#13;
envisioned for the newly created TD in Kazakstan.&#13;
E;xecution of budgetary expenditures&#13;
2.            The remaing sections of this chapter addresses in detail the proposed design of those&#13;
components contained in the lined box on the right of Chart 1, and deal in detail only with&#13;
expenditures. Revenues collected by the tax and customs administration would be recorded at an&#13;
aggregate level in the TLS, 1' and would be reconciled with deposits made in the TSA.&#13;
Overiew&#13;
3.4.          The various budget implementation activities (identified in Chart 1) are summarized in&#13;
information flow terms in Chart 2. The process begins with the recording of the approved budget&#13;
(and any amendments thereoo by the MOF in the TLS by individual appropriation items or revenue&#13;
estimates. Using this as a basis, comnmitmnent lismits may also be determined, against which spending.&#13;
units can make conmmitments (the comrnitment stage). A funds allocation limit will be determined&#13;
periodically on the basis of cash availability, and entered by the MOF against an appropriate&#13;
aggregation of appropriation items. When deliveries have been made, and bills received, the&#13;
spending unit acknowledges the fulfillment of the commitment and confirms an obligation to pay (the&#13;
verification stage). In the final stage, the spending unit makes (or authorizes) the payment. Revenues&#13;
collected are recorded on the TLS.&#13;
5.            The implementation of these processes could be in two ways, depending on the&#13;
linkage of the spending units to the system-direct (SUd) or indirect (SUi).&#13;
11     lThe revenue recording would be at a level of aggregation consistenlt with the esdmautes preseted in th&#13;
budget documentation.&#13;

Information flow&#13;
6.            The Main Budget Department prepares and registers in the TLS the detailed allocation&#13;
of budgeary appropriations by ministry, and advises ministries accordingly (flow 1). This should be&#13;
done within the limits of appropriation approved by the Supreme Soviet. The Department may also&#13;
set and register quarterly lirmits on commitrnents by ministry (flow 2) and by category of spending (at&#13;
the level of aggregation deemed appropriate). Ministries would then advise budgetary appropriations&#13;
and commitment limits to their respective spending units and enter the limits in the system (flow 3).&#13;
7.            Registration of actual commitments would be made in the treasury system by the&#13;
ministries and spending units directly linked (SUd) to the system (flow 4), or by the spending units&#13;
indirectly linked (SUi) in a parallel system through a Regional Treasury Unit (RTU) (flow 5). Tbe&#13;
SUi will be periodically informed by the RTU of their limits (flow 6).&#13;
8.            In the verification stage,Y once all the requirements for a particular obligation have&#13;
been met, the spending unit should confirm that the commitment is ready for payment (flow 4, SUd,&#13;
and flow 5, SUi).&#13;
9.            It should be noted that the process outlined above can be simplified for certain types&#13;
of expenditure, either administratively or by automated procedures in the treasury system. For&#13;
example, salary commitments may be advised only once a year on an estimated basis and adjusted as&#13;
necessary during the year. The commitment (and verification) of small expenditures (up to a&#13;
predetermined limit) can be entered into the system simultaneously with the order for their payment.&#13;
However, the system must lknow in advance which expenditure items allow such simplification, to&#13;
prevent misuse.&#13;
10.           To encourage advance planaing of the larger expenditures, it may be appropriate for&#13;
the MOF to propose limits on cash availability against spending unit expenditure items. These would&#13;
be advised to mrinistries by the Branch of Cash and State Debts of the TD (flow 7) in accordance with&#13;
the financial plan, specified by category of spending. Ministries would, in turn, advise spending units&#13;
(flow 7). The advance knowledge of indicative cash limits, as well as of quarterly commitments&#13;
limits, will allow agencies to make the best arrangements and to set priorities in a situation of scarce&#13;
resources, so chat any necessary cuts in planned expenditures can be rade in a more orderly and&#13;
effective way.&#13;
11.           After taking into account both the balance in the TSA and the balance in spending&#13;
units' expenditure items in the system, the Branch of Cash and State Debts would make funds&#13;
allocations (set cash limits) to ministries for each category of spending (flow 8), thereby allowing&#13;
them to distribute these fnacial releases (limits) among their respective spending units and enter the&#13;
limiits in the system (flow 9).&#13;
12.           Under ideal circumstances, the fuinds allocation would be consisteat with the proposed&#13;
1'     The verification stage of the expendiure pmcess is important in that it confirms an obligaion to pay.&#13;
Vterification procedures are normally carried out by the spending unit and recorded in the units' ledger, or im&#13;
other admnistrative docmeats maintained for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
cash limits advised to ministries earlier (flow 7). Both proposed and actual cash allocation quarterly&#13;
limits would also be consistent with the quarterly commitment levels and budget appropriation made&#13;
on an annual basis, thereby minimizing the necessity to replan activities. The degree of consistercy&#13;
in the process will largely depend on the quality of the initial fincial planning process and the&#13;
revenue collection outcome.&#13;
13.          Following the verification for a given expenditure, ministries and spending units&#13;
directly linked to the system (SUd) would record the corresponding payment order in the system (flow-&#13;
10). The system would automatically check that the order falls within the fumds allocation limit set&#13;
for that SUd. The indirectly linked spending units would process a payment order through the RTU&#13;
(flow 11). The latter would check the payment order issued by SUi and register it in the TLS&#13;
(flow 12).&#13;
14.           At the end of each day, the TLS would prepare a file with complete information on&#13;
the creditors and payments to be made, as advised by ministries and spending units. This file would&#13;
be sent to the NBK which holds the TSA (flow 13), which would in turn transmit the relevant&#13;
information (and funds) to each commercial bank (flow 14), to credit to the appropriate account (flow&#13;
15), and debit the TSA. The NBK would confirm to the TLS the debits in the TSA (flow 16).&#13;
15.          Computerization of such a budget execution system through a centrally controlled TLS&#13;
needs to take into account the following factors:&#13;
(a)   the accounting strucrure of the TLS should directly reflect the structure of the central&#13;
government budget appropriation items approved by the Supreme Soviet, that is, there&#13;
should be a one-to-one relationship. It should contain one item for each head of&#13;
expenditure (appropriation) in the annual Budget Law, for each standing appropriation&#13;
(where such a mechanism is utilized), each head of receipt, and each refund of&#13;
receipts;&#13;
(b)    in many situations, the budget appropriation items will not be detailed enough for day-&#13;
to-day operations and management, and ministries (or spending units) mnay wish to&#13;
expand the chart of accounts to allow proper expenditure control and transaction&#13;
processing at a more detailed level. This can be achieved in one of two ways. First,&#13;
the central TLS chart of accounts can be expanded to accommodate ministry and&#13;
spending unit accounting requirements, with all transaaions carried out as described&#13;
above. Alternatively, ministries may utilize their own accounting (ledger) system.&#13;
This would allow much of the detailed transaction processing to take place on the&#13;
ministry system (and with proper control mechanisms to transmit the payment&#13;
instructions directly to the bank containing the TSA), with only aggregate data&#13;
consistent with the budget appropriation structure transmitted to the TLS. Ia the&#13;
initial stages of development in Kazakstan, it is envisaged that the first method is&#13;
adopted;&#13;
(c)    the level of existing (or proposed) computerization at the ministry and spending unfts&#13;
and the associated communication systems will determine the capability of units to be&#13;
directly or indirectly linked to the central TLS. This, ia turm, wiU have a significant&#13;
bearing on the requirement to establish RTUs. This aspect must be addressed early in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
,Amex t&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
the system development process, taking into account the existing relevant&#13;
comnunication infrastructure; and&#13;
(d)   the technical solution adopted will be one which ersures the appropriate integrity and&#13;
security of the goverarnent financial data.&#13;
RTU Operations&#13;
16.          The geographic size of Kazakstan, and distribution of spending units through the&#13;
administrative system of regions and districts (of which there are 21 and 280 respectively) suggests&#13;
that a substantial number of RTUs will be required. As mentioned above, this aspect will require&#13;
early consideration in the system development.&#13;
17.          Chart 4 illustrates the interaction of a typical the RTUs vwith the TLS and with the&#13;
spending units. The relationships described would remain valid, regardless of which option is&#13;
implemented for the Ministry FMIS, whether it is on an expanded TLS or is stand alone.&#13;
18.          The Ministry's FM2S contains details of transactions received electronically from&#13;
SUd (flow 1) and by other means (hard copy documents, floppy disk transaction batches, etc.)&#13;
from SUil (flow 2). The TLS records transactions by the mrinistries (flow 3) at an aggregate&#13;
level, transmitted from the Ministry's FMIS where the details of individual transactions are&#13;
recorded. The Ministry's FAGS also receives funds allocation data and management reporting&#13;
(the latter to assist with reconciliation between the TLS and the FMIS) from the TLS (flow 4).&#13;
The Ministry's FMS, in tum, provides funds allocation and reports to the SUd (flow 5) and the&#13;
SUil (flow 6).&#13;
19.          Any spending unit not liriked to the TLS through a ministry would report through&#13;
an RTU-as is illustrated by SUi2 in Chart 4. Payments and receipts information would be passed&#13;
to the RTU in hard copy or on floppy disk (flow 7) and be used to update the TLS (flow 8). The&#13;
TLS would then update the mninistry's FMIS (flow 4). Funds allocation data and reports would be&#13;
sent from the TLS to the RTU (flow 9) then passed on to the SUi2 (flow 10).&#13;
20.          The RTUs would be established where it is not practicable for individual speading&#13;
units to be linked to their parent ministry or to the TLS. An RTU mnight be set up to serve a&#13;
number of separate spending units, from a variety of ministries, in a particular area. In this case,&#13;
it would be necessary only to provide a single communications link to the TLS rather than a link&#13;
to each spending unit. In areas where the comrnmunications infrastructure is particularly deficient,&#13;
it might be necessary for the RTU to communicate by courier with both the spending units and&#13;
the TLS. As the communications infrastructure imnproves, the re4uirement for the RTU to serve:&#13;
as the link to the TLS would decline.&#13;
21.          The project provides for acquisition of computer H/W, systems SIW, appliuation&#13;
development and DBMS S/W, and application of S/W and technical training, required for the&#13;
implementation of the treasury system at the TD in the MOF head offices in Almaty/Akmola, the&#13;
RTUs, and the DTUs. Following briefly describing the strategy for implementing the&#13;
computerization of the treasury system.&#13;

HIW. SIW Strategy for Irnplemnenting the Treasury System&#13;
22.          The overall H/W, SfW strategy for the project is to assist specify the nature, size&#13;
and distribution of computer processing facilities and associated work stations; the nature of the&#13;
communications connections between the nodes of the network; and the naturc and type of&#13;
application development, systems S/W and Data Base Management Systems (DBMS), that should&#13;
be employed for the project.&#13;
23.          The H/W, S/W strategy for the project is determined by the characteristics of ther&#13;
application systems for government budgeting and accounting which may be summarized as&#13;
foUows:&#13;
(a) The application systems for the execution of the govermnent budget will&#13;
consist of several modules that need to exchange data with each other;&#13;
(b) Some modules will need to be implemented at multiple levels (e.g., TD,&#13;
RTUs at the regions and the District Treasury Units (DTUs) spending units.&#13;
Data will be generated, stored and processed at each level and will need to be&#13;
transferred between the various levels;&#13;
(c) The data and transaction volumes will vary by region and spending unit. For&#13;
the TD and for the TUs at some regions and some spending units they could&#13;
be quite high.&#13;
Hardware Architecture&#13;
24.          The application characteristics require that a distributed architecture be used and&#13;
computer processing power be located at the various nodes of the network (TD, RTUs, and&#13;
DTTUs). Where facilities allow and data volumes justify it, these nodes should be connected via&#13;
telecommunications facilities. The transaction processing and database management required at&#13;
each node should be carried out by the computers installed at these nodes. Summary or detailed&#13;
data, as required, would be transmitted via telecommunications facilities to the central computers&#13;
located at the TD in Almaty.&#13;
25.          The advantage of such an architecture is that it distnbutes computing power,&#13;
commensurate with needs, to different nodes of the network, thereby optimizing usage and&#13;
making it more reliable and less vulnerable to malfunctions at a single central site. rn addition,&#13;
end users at regional treasury units have better control over their technological and data resources&#13;
and this inculcates a sense of ownership for the systems they use.&#13;
26.          This architecture also allows more flexibility of telecornmunications faciIties. la&#13;
the absence of good telecommunications facilities, data transfer between the nodes and the center&#13;
could be periodic - say daily, weekly, or monthly depending on the application system - in an&#13;
off-line/batch mode. In the complete absence of telecomrnunications faciities, data transfer could&#13;
be by computer compatible media (such as diskettes).&#13;
27.           The size and distribution of computing power across the various nodes of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Am= I&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
network is determined by the volumes of data and transactions that are generated and stored at the&#13;
various nodes and the volumes and frequencies of data that are transmitted between the nodes.&#13;
formnation gathered from discussions with MOF officials has been used to estimate the sie and&#13;
location of computers. This information will be progressively refined by the consultants during&#13;
the preparation phase of the project, by undertaking actual surveys to gather data for each region&#13;
and district. The computer configurations required to be installed at the central TD, the&#13;
Ministries, the RTUs at the regions and DTUJs at the districts, and an estimate of associated co,.&#13;
is given in Annex II and are briefly described below.&#13;
28.          In keeping with the H/W, S/W strategy explained above, it is envisagede that the.&#13;
treasury system will be implemented using a distributed computing architecture. A computer&#13;
capable of supporting up to 64 users will be installed at the TD in the center; computs capable&#13;
of supporting up to 16 conacrrent users will be installed at each of the Ministry Head Offices in&#13;
Almaty; computers capable of supporting up to 32 concurrent users will be installed at each of the&#13;
RTUs, and one/two PCs will be installed at each of the DTUs. In view of the Government's&#13;
plans to move the capital to Akmola, the TD will eventually shift to Akimola. However, AlImaty&#13;
will remzin the main commercial center with sizeable activity as far as the treasury system is&#13;
concerned. Therefore, an additional computer configuration capable of handling the workload at&#13;
the new capital will also be required to be installed at Akanola when the move takes place.&#13;
29.          The NBK is planning to establish a Packet Switched Data Network (PSDN)&#13;
connecting Almaty with all regions and districts. This network is expected to be completed by&#13;
early 1996 and NBK plans to make this network available to all financial institutions in the&#13;
country and offices of the MOP on a fee for service basis. It is envisaged that the computers&#13;
installed in the treasury systems network will be connected via this PSDN network. In case this&#13;
network is delayed, the computers at each of the nodes will be connected via leased/dial up&#13;
telephone lines, as is currently being done by the NBK for connecting its Head offices with its&#13;
own regional and district offices. Currently the network is capable of supporting batch data&#13;
transfers between nodes, on a daily basis.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Software Strategy&#13;
30.          The nature of the application systems requires that the same core functionality&#13;
available at all nodes of the network. Thus, for example, the core functionality requirements will&#13;
be similar at all RTUs. The requirements at the spending units will similarly be identical.&#13;
Therefore, the same application S/W package would need to be replicated at multiple sites. This&#13;
characteristic requires that the application SIW be scaleable and be able to run on small or large&#13;
computers without major changes. Scalability can be achieved either by choosing a line of&#13;
computers of varying capacities which are fully compatible from the SIW perspective. However,&#13;
such a choice would restrict further additions to the network to this vendor and to this line of&#13;
computers. Alternatively, to avoid these restrictions, the application systems should be developed:&#13;
using application development tools and DBMS S/W that can operate on machines of different&#13;
sizes offered by several vendors. This feature is called S/W portability.&#13;
31.          Several application development and DBMS packages are available in the market&#13;
which are both vertically and horizontally portable. Ideally the way to ensure vertical and&#13;
horizontal portability and scalabiity at the various nodes of the network, is to choose H/W and&#13;
SIW that subicnbes to the open systems concepts. In practice, the environment that comes closest&#13;
to this concept is the UNIX envirorunent. Applications developed under this environment would&#13;
be able to run, with minimum changes, on any computer that has a UNIX based operating&#13;
system. Most H/W vendors now offer a version of UNIX as an operating systems alternative.&#13;
32.          The project therefore proposes to use UNIX as the operating system environment&#13;
across the nodes of the network. In addition, the application development environment chosen&#13;
will use Fourth Generation Languages (4gls) and Relational Data Base Management Systems&#13;
(DBMSs) and associated development tools, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to increase&#13;
application development productivity and offer a user friendly environtnent for data access and&#13;
usage.&#13;

Trainng strategy and program&#13;
Training strategy&#13;
1.    The aim of the training strategy is to develop a cadre of professionals who will be able to operate, maintain&#13;
and use the treasury system both during its development, piloting and replication, and after it is complete. It is also&#13;
designed to strengthen commitment to the reform process by showing its logic and advantages, and by providing&#13;
participants with adequate information about the process, and their roles in it. By matching the investment in&#13;
equipment and systems with a parallel investment in people, the full benefits of the system can be achieved. Given&#13;
that the treasury system will extend to many sites and involve many people, the most effective way to address training&#13;
needs is via a casc.ade approach, the essential aim being to train limited numbers of key people who will then train&#13;
much larger numbers of subordinates. This approach requires comprehensive, and well documented courses, so that&#13;
those who are trained can then act effectively as trainers of others. Two main groups of training skills are needed:&#13;
-accounting, financial management and auditing;&#13;
-information technology and software applications.&#13;
2.     The exisience of several identifiable groups with separate training requirements, implies the need for a&#13;
modular approach. In addition, a large-scale familiarization drive is needed at the commencement of the project to&#13;
ensure that the nature of the project is widely understood amongst decision-makers.&#13;
Target groups&#13;
3.     The training component will prepare those involved in the treasury modernization project to carry out their&#13;
roles effectively. The following target groups have been identified:&#13;
System developers&#13;
These are the members of the department of information systems of the treasury department.&#13;
System administrators and applications managers&#13;
These are the personnel to be placed in charge of computer installations at the centre, in oblasts, rayons and&#13;
ministries.&#13;
Personnel responsible for transaction processing&#13;
These are the personnel entering transactions data into the system under the supervision of system&#13;
administrators and applications managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of S&#13;
System users&#13;
These are the people who will be using the treasury system as a tool: to extract data, to check the status of a&#13;
transaction, to establish budgetary control, to order and pay for supplies, to pay wages, to manage cash resources etc.&#13;
Personnel of the budget bank&#13;
These include those members of staff of the budget bank playing key roles in carrying out treasury&#13;
transactions (e.g.managers and accountants).&#13;
Others&#13;
This category includes senior managers who need to understand the role, coverage and significance of the&#13;
system in relation to their supervision and other responsibilities; senior staff of the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
government auditors.&#13;
Treasury training unit&#13;
4.     A separate unit is required for treasury training. For successful implementation of the project, it would need&#13;
to be integrated with the treasury department. An appropriate relationship with the department for personnel issues&#13;
and educational institutions of the ministry of finance would also be necessary.&#13;
5.     The treasury training unit would have the general responsibility for creating and implementing an annual&#13;
training program for the treasury department, setting out the courses to be designed and delivered, their objectives&#13;
and duration, numbers to be trained, the locations for training and the necessary inputs from various sources. This&#13;
plan would be approved by the Deputy Minister for Finance annually. To carry out these functions, the training unit&#13;
would have the following responsibilities:&#13;
(a) to carry out assessments of training needs, including the needs of end-users&#13;
(b) to design both regular and ad hoc courses as needed by the treasury generally, and specifically by the&#13;
treasury modernization project&#13;
(c) to develop training materials on the basis of manuals, papers, systems and procedures developed under&#13;
the treasury modernization project, in a form suitable for training in all aspects of treasury operations&#13;
(d) to create comprehensive modular training packages as described below&#13;
(e) to schedule, organize and run courses in relation to the needs of the Treasury and of the treasury&#13;
modernization project&#13;
(f) to plan and organize short course training to be provided by contractors in close liaison with the&#13;
department of information systems&#13;
(g) to implement a cascade training approach by supporting the activities of those trained, to train others&#13;
(h) to carry out assessments of the success of training activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

management&#13;
6.     Given the extensive needs for training under the project, the treasury training unit would require adequate&#13;
funding and staffing. Initially it would have a head of unit, two senior trainers and four trainers. The&#13;
numbers of trainers in information technology would be lower than those in accounting and financial management&#13;
because of the existence of information technology skills in the department of information systems of the teasury part&#13;
of which would be available for training. During the period stretching from just before the beginning of the pilot&#13;
phase. to after the start of full implementation, the unit would be assisted by an internationally recruited training&#13;
adviser for a period of one and a half years.&#13;
Training program modules&#13;
7.     The main training modules would be:&#13;
(a) Elements of government accounting, financial management internal control and internal audit&#13;
(b) Overview of the treasury system (appreciation course)&#13;
(c) Financial procedures&#13;
(d) Transactions processing for budget execution&#13;
(e) Information technology&#13;
(f) Application systems&#13;
(g) Site management procedures&#13;
(h) Courses for end-users&#13;
8.     The above would be customized to the requirements of different users at different stages of project&#13;
development, but would be robustly designed to continue as permanent courses after completion of the project.&#13;
Phased implementation&#13;
9.     Training must be adapted to the three phases of project implementation:&#13;
(a) system development&#13;
(b) pilot site implementation&#13;
(c) full implementaion&#13;
Phase (a) The main aim is to establish a training unit within the treasury department which would work very closely&#13;
with the department of information systems of the treasury. Secondary aims are:&#13;
(i) to equip staff of the department of information technology with appropriate skills.&#13;
(ii) to inform a wide cross section of senior staff about the objectives and characteristics of the new treasury&#13;
system (Overview of treasury system).&#13;
(iii) to prepare staff at pilot sites for the change-over to the new system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
Phase (b) This is the pilot phase. The aim is first to develop courses and training materials, and second to deliver the&#13;
courses as required for the successful implementation of the system at pilot sites. Given the cascade training concept,&#13;
each person trained will be briefed on this concept and trainees will require at least ten sets of training materials&#13;
besides their own, with which to train their subordinates when they return to their work. To ensure a reliable quality&#13;
of training at this level will require central support, evaluation of the success of training and remedial training where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
Phase (c) The training materials developed in phase two will be further refined before the start of this phase. The&#13;
same basic courses will be given in this phase as were given in phase two, with the exception that a full range of end-&#13;
user training packages will be developed. At this stage, many sites will come on line in quick succession according&#13;
to a predetermined schedule of site preparation, installation and training. This implies the need for adequate training&#13;
capacity and appropriate pre-planning of training resources. This may require the use of the best of those trained in&#13;
phase (b) to undertake some training responsibilities in localities other than their own during this phase.&#13;
Delivery mechanisms&#13;
10.    In terms of locations, modular training would be delivered as follows:&#13;
(a) at the project site in Almaty on dedicated equipment (small numbers of trainees)&#13;
(b) in the computer laboratory of the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(c) in a large computer laboratory in Almaty (larger numbers)&#13;
(d) at all implementation sites both at the time of installation and subsequently&#13;
(e) at selected institutions of higher education for classroom-based sessions&#13;
(f) at the training base of the ministry of finance&#13;
(g) other&#13;
11.    Trainers would be drawn from the following sources:&#13;
(i) the training unit of the treasury department&#13;
(ii) the department of information systems of the treasury department&#13;
(iii) non-training staff of the treasury department&#13;
(iv) selected conmmercial firms for standard, information technology courses concerning operating systems,&#13;
networks, communications protocols etc.&#13;
(v) selected academic and training institutions for classroom based courses&#13;
(vi) selected trainees who show talent for training&#13;
12.    Training materials would be produced in a standard project format and would be classified and archived in a&#13;
dedicated database for ease of reference and subsequent access.&#13;
13.    While most training activities will occur in-country, funds exist for short study tours for selected members of&#13;
staff.&#13;

Project launch&#13;
14.    The project launch will be in July 1996. This will be a two day occasion, comprising a formal launching of&#13;
the project (first half-day)and a seminar for the rest of the time. The seminar will cover the&#13;
following topics, on each of which a paper will be presented (45 minutes) followed by questions, answers and&#13;
discussion (45 minutes):&#13;
(a) public financial management reform (an international perspective).&#13;
(b) overview of public financial management reform in Kazakstan:improvements in budgeting, expenditure&#13;
control, expenditure classification and the role of audit.&#13;
(c) the planned treasury system: overview, implementation plan and the planned outputs of the system (both&#13;
deliverables and the main financial reports which will be produced by Government).&#13;
(d) the planned treasury system: expenditure controls, commitment accounting and disbursement procedures.&#13;
(e) the planned treasury system: the role of information technology.&#13;
(f) the planned treasury system: training, the human dimension and the management of change.&#13;
15.    The project launch and seminar will be designed for an attendance of 200-300, comprising directors,&#13;
managers, senior staff and financial management staff of the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank of Kazakstan,&#13;
line ministries, government audit organizations and oblasts, together with selected trainers and academics with&#13;
relevant expertise.&#13;
Diffusion of the project concept&#13;
16.    Workshops will be organized both as a prelude to pilot implementation, and as a sequel to it. These events&#13;
will be designed for managers. senior financial staff, accountants and trainers in line ministries, oblasts, audit bodies&#13;
and training institutions. A separate seminar will be organized for staff of the Ministry of Finance including the&#13;
treasury department, before the beginning of the pilot phase.&#13;

            The Treasury Modernization
            Project's overall aim is to support the new Treasury
            Department in establishing a treasury system: a) that
            provides comprehensive, reliable and timely financial
            management information; and b) that helps manage government
            expenditure effectively. To achieve this aim, the project
            sets three specific objectives: a) prepare a detailed
            functional design for the treasury system and develop
            related procedures; b) provide and install the computer
            resources to implement the treasury system; and c) ensure
            that local staff can operate and maintain the system
            effectively. The project consists of the following
            components: a) design of the computerized treasury system;
            b) pilot system computerization; and c) full implementation
            of the computerized system.
