(EDI), as reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
The Human Development Division of EDI (EDIHD), in collaboration with the Harvard Institute&#13;
for International Development (HIID), conducted a workshop on reform of public pension&#13;
systems, The Global Social Security Crisis, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from July 6-17,&#13;
1998. This was the second offering jointly delivered by EDI-HIID, the same workshop being&#13;
conducted in July, 1997. The objective of the workshop was to provide government officials&#13;
and staff of multilateral institutions working on pension systems with both (i) the theoretical&#13;
framework underlying pension reform and (ii) practical issues drawn from county case&#13;
studies and experiences of policy experts from governments, academic institutions and the&#13;
World Bank. The workshop covered various design and implementation aspects of pension&#13;
systems, including alternative strategies for privatization. At the end of the two-week&#13;
session, participants developed and presented their reform proposals for their own countries.&#13;
A total of 77 participants representing 30 countries attended the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop evaluation was a Level I (participants' reaction) evaluation designed solely by&#13;
the course organizers, including the development of a participants' feedback questionnaire.&#13;
The EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) was not consulted by the organizers in the process of&#13;
designing the evaluation, and assisted with the evaluation only by processing the data. The&#13;
participants' feedback questionnaire consisted of three types of questions. The first type of&#13;
question was on the usefulness of 33 individual presentations by different presenters as well&#13;
as participants' satisfaction on 8 social events. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from&#13;
1=minimum to 5=maximum was used for the questions. The second type of question was&#13;
participants' self-assessment of their knowledge of four key issues before and after the&#13;
workshop, also measured on a 5-point scale. The third type of question was a series of open-&#13;
ended questions on specific aspects of the workshop, including participants' class&#13;
participation, reading assignments, and general comments on the overall workshop.&#13;
&#13;
The participants' feedback questionnaire was completed by 57 respondents, 74% of the total&#13;
participants. Twelve respondents, or 21.1% of all respondents, were Finance Ministry&#13;
officials, 26 respondents (45.6%) were Social Security officials, 12 respondents (21.1%) were&#13;
staff of International Organizations, and 7 (12.3%) were from other institutions. Following is a&#13;
summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The overall usefulness of the workshop received a mean score of 4.13 on a 5-point&#13;
        scale. Respondents' satisfaction with the administration of the workshop also&#13;
        exceeded 4.0 (mean=4.17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  All 33 presentations received a mean score exceeding 3.0 out of 5.0. The highest&#13;
        rating of 4.35 was awarded to two presentations. These were the sessions on&#13;
        Critiquing the Privatization of Social Security (week 2), and Administrative Costs of&#13;
        Public and Private Pension Systems (week 1). Respondents' ratings were among the&#13;
        lowest on 3 sessions of country-specific presentations. They were Critiquing the&#13;
        Chilean Reform (mean=3.16), Country Case: Poland (mean=3.23), and Country Case:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Bolivia (mean=3.20). This suggested a possible weakness of the workshop in country&#13;
 study presentations. Respondents' satisfaction with 8 social events ranged between&#13;
 3.29-4.39 out of 5.0.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lComparison between the pre-/post-workshop ratings of respondents' self-assessed&#13;
 knowledge showed a positive gain in all 4 subject areas at least by 37%. Two items&#13;
 that had the largest gain were the status of pension reforms around the world and&#13;
 national experience with privatized system. Their pre-workshop mean scores were the&#13;
 lowest among the 4 items, 2.56 and 2.38, respectively, but the ratings increased by&#13;
 more than 50% at the end of the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lSixty-three percent of the respondents reported that class participation could have&#13;
 been improved. When asked whether respondents spoke as often as they wished,&#13;
 52% answered "yes," but 48% responded otherwise. In their written comments,&#13;
 respondents suggested that class discussion could be improved by 1) ensuring a&#13;
 discussion time allocated in each session (N=9); 2) having a smaller class or&#13;
 conducting small-group activities (N=7); and 3) concentrating more on country case&#13;
 studies or experiences by soliciting views from participants and allowing all final&#13;
 proposals by participants to be presented before class (N=5). Respondents also felt&#13;
 that instructors should facilitate the discussion by encouraging participants to ask&#13;
 questions (N=6), avoiding monopolization of class by some participants (N=2), and&#13;
 limiting the time of interventions by other participating instructors and organizers&#13;
 (N=4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lResults showed that 57% of the respondents spent on average 1-2 hours per day&#13;
 reading and/or working on the case solutions or exercises during the workshop, 28%&#13;
 spent 3-4 hours, and 7% spent more than 5 hours. Nine percent of all respondents&#13;
 reported that they spent less than 1 hour per day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lRespondents were also asked approximately what percentage of the required reading&#13;
 they completed by the end of the two-week workshop. While 20% of all respondents&#13;
 reported to have completed 75% or more of the required readings, more than half of&#13;
 the respondents said that they finished less than 50% of the required readings. This&#13;
 may be an area of weakness of the workshop. Course organizers may need to re-&#13;
 consider the reading demands they are making on participants as well as to&#13;
 encourage participants to read more for higher achievement in understanding the&#13;
 subject materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe participants' feedback questionnaire of this workshop had three shortcomings in&#13;
 design. First, asking participants to rate all 33 individual presentations at the end of&#13;
 the two-week workshop may have had introduced bias, since participants may not&#13;
 have been able to recall the earlier presentations correctly. Second, there were no&#13;
 questions in the questionnaire measuring the overall achievement of workshop&#13;
 objectives, or content, design, and delivery of the workshop. Third, there were no&#13;
 questions that objectively measured learning, except participants' self-assessment of&#13;
 pre-/post-workshop knowledge of 4 general topics. The workshop organizers are&#13;
 encouraged to work with EDIES in developing the questionnaires for future workshops,&#13;
 in order to be able to measure these critical dimensions more accurately and&#13;
 completely.&#13;
