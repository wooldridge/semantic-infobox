            This third World Development Report is
            published at a time of difficulty and uncertainty for the
            world economy, particularly for the developing coutnries.
            Developing countries start the decade facing two major
            challenges: to continue the social and economic progress of
            the past 30 years in an international climate that looks
            less helpful; and to tackle the plight of the 800 million
            people living in absolute poverty, who have benefitted too
            little from past progress. This report examines some of the
            difficulties and prospects in both areas. One of its central
            themes is the importance of people in development. The first
            part of the report addresses the expected sluggish world
            economic growth as oil-importing countries reduce their
            current account deficits and adapt to higher energy costs.
            Domestic policies of developing countries will be crucial,
            and the fate of poor people in these countries will be
            decided largely by domestic opportunities and policies. The
            second part of the report describes the role of human
            development programs (in education, health, nutrition, and
            fertility reduction) and their related effects on
            productivity and population growth.
