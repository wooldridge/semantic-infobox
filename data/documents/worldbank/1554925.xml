ABSTRACT&#13;
With a 1980 population of 12.5 million, metropolitan Sao Paulo in&#13;
Brazil is now one of the largest urban areas in the world. Pressures of&#13;
growth, fast rising land values and pollution and congestion have&#13;
encouraged the beginnings of a spontaneous decentralization of industrial&#13;
plants from the metropolitan area into the rest of the State of Sao Paulo&#13;
and into adjoining states. This outward movement was made possible by&#13;
extensive public infrastructure investments in the secondary cities of the&#13;
state over the past 25 years, and is now fostered by an industrial&#13;
pollution control policy within the Greater Sao Paulo area.&#13;
This paper reports on part of the results of a survey undertaken&#13;
in 1980 of 581 industrial companies establishing new plants in new&#13;
locations in the State between 1977 and 1979. These new locations were&#13;
both within the metropolitan area and in the hinterland cities. The sample&#13;
included new companies ("births"), companies establishing an additional&#13;
unit ("branches"), and companies closing down at one location and reopening&#13;
at another ("transfers"). Questions were included in the survey.about&#13;
decision-making procedures for the choice of location and about the&#13;
experience of the firms at the new locations.   This paper, however, only&#13;
reports on the preliminary analysis of responses given to questions asked&#13;
in the survey about the motives for seeking a new site or building. From a&#13;
wide range of factors considered, a relatively small number play the&#13;
dominant role in both decisions, but considerable variation is found by&#13;
location of the plant and by the characteristics of the company involved.&#13;

SUMMARY&#13;
I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE SURVEY&#13;
Metropolitan Sao Paulo in Brazil is one of the largest urban&#13;
areas in the world today. Its rapid population expansion, from 2.7&#13;
million in 1950 to 12.5 million in 1980, has continued to run well ahead&#13;
of the national rate of growth, but at a diminishing rate. In the 1950s&#13;
the city was growing by 6.1 percent per annum or twice the national growth&#13;
rate; by the 1970s the growth rate had slowed to 4.4 percent annually or&#13;
1 1/2 the national rate.&#13;
This slowing in part reflects improved conditions for growth of&#13;
both population and industrial activity in the secondary cities of the&#13;
State of Sao Paulo and the beginings of a related spontaneous&#13;
decentralization of manufacturing. Given pollution, congestion and the&#13;
condition of public health within the metropolitan area, the issue of&#13;
whether public policy should actively foster this industrial&#13;
decentralization has become an important topic of political debate.&#13;
Present promotional policies by secondary cities are weak, and the&#13;
industrial pollution control policy which may encourage decentralization&#13;
was introduced only recently.&#13;
As a contribution to this policy debate, as well as to gain&#13;
insights applicable to other cities, a survey was undertaken in 1980 of&#13;
581 manufacturing firms establishing new plants in the State of Sao Paulo&#13;
between 1977 and 1979. The survey was part of the National Spatial&#13;
Policies research project of the Urban and Regional Economics Division of&#13;
the World Bank.&#13;
What pushes plants to relocate their sites? What attracts a&#13;
company to certain locations over others? How precisely can we answer&#13;
these questions? This paper reports on the preliminary analysis of&#13;
responses given to questions asked in the survey abouth both the motives&#13;
for seeking a new plant location and the factors entering into the choice&#13;
of the new site or building. Other parts of the survey will be reported&#13;
on in later papers.&#13;
II. FINDINGS&#13;
The findings, though revealing certain patterns, do not lead to&#13;
ease in generalization. In common with findings of industrial location&#13;
surveys undertaken in the United States and the United Kingdom, the Sao&#13;
Paulo survey found a great diversity in the factors which influence&#13;
location decisions. In addition, this survey reveals a shift in the&#13;
importance of various factors dependent on the kind and distance of the&#13;
move being made and the size and type of the plant in question. In order&#13;
to clarify the analysis, the plants were divided into three movement&#13;
categories:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a) 122 births (new plants of new companies)&#13;
(b) 91 branch plant moves (companies establishing an&#13;
additional unit)&#13;
(c) 368 transfer moves (involving the closure of an&#13;
existing unit and a reopening at a new location).&#13;
Responses of the branch and transfer moves were further divided&#13;
into four geographical categories:&#13;
(i)  Across city moves.  Moves within the built-up area&#13;
of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area but not&#13;
decentralizing as in (ii).&#13;
(ii)  Suburbanizing moves.  Moves from the central part&#13;
of the metropolitan area out to other part of the&#13;
continuous built-up area.&#13;
(iii) Exurbanizing moves. Moves from both the central&#13;
and the remaining built-up part of the metro-&#13;
politan area out to other locations on the edge of&#13;
the metropolitan area across the rest of the State.&#13;
(iv) Other moves. Moves within cities and between&#13;
cities outside of the metropolitan areao&#13;
The analysis further sub-divided the sample plants by character-&#13;
istics such as size, sector, capital intensity, type of building, tech-&#13;
nology used, etc. The usefulness of these categories was borne by the&#13;
contrast in location factor choice across the sub-divisions.&#13;
Ao Locational Pull Factors&#13;
The analysis reported in this paper considers first the patterns&#13;
of factors which entered into the choice of the new site or building for&#13;
the 581 Sao Paulo companies interviewed. The companies were asked to&#13;
choose the factors they considered decisive or important from among 38&#13;
location factors offered them. The 581 plants were selected from among&#13;
1961 identified new plant openings in manufacturing industry in the State&#13;
between 1977 and 1979, with a bias toward the larger plants and those&#13;
moving further from the metropolitan area. Weighting factors have&#13;
therefore been applied in the summary tables.&#13;
Overall, the top four location pull factors for all branches and&#13;
transfers, except the across city moves, are: ease of raod access, a&#13;
suitable plot, space for expansion, and available and reliable electric&#13;
power supply. The priorities for the across city moves are different:&#13;
plentiful labor, quality of labor with required skills, public trans-&#13;
portation to site, and property to lease.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
The leading four factors in each of the five groups of moves&#13;
either repeat the factors cited above, or add the following: the&#13;
availability of telephone and telex (for all groups), access to suppliers&#13;
(for all groups), land cost (for the suburbanizing and exurbanizing&#13;
groups), and personal and family reasons (for the Other group, moves&#13;
within the hinterland).&#13;
Thus, the most important reasons for choosing a new site or&#13;
building among the 38 possible location factors are very similar across&#13;
all five groups of firms. Only the proportionate ranking of each factor&#13;
as of major or decisive importance varies across the groups. Below the&#13;
top eight factors, there is much greater variety in the rankings.&#13;
1. Labor Supply&#13;
The first group of factors, labor supply, although important for&#13;
a large number of firms, was not rated important as frequently as other&#13;
factors, and was seldom an overriding concern. The lowered importance of&#13;
labor factors compared to the U.S. and U.K. studies undoubtedly reflects&#13;
the labor abundant nature of the Brazilian economy and the high wages in&#13;
manufacturing relative to other sectors. Plentiful labor supplies (1) was&#13;
cited as of major or decisive importance by 54 percent of all firms, more&#13;
so for births and moves within the metro area and less so for destinations&#13;
outside. Cheap labor (19 percent overall) was much more important for&#13;
births (29 percent) than other groups. Labor with required skills (33&#13;
percent) was more important for births and across city moves than for the&#13;
exurban group. The factor of little competition for labor in the area was&#13;
relatively unimportant for all, while union activity was completely&#13;
unimportant, no doubt due to restrictions on unionization in Brazil.&#13;
Technical training and quality of basic schools were only important to&#13;
destinations outside the metro area.&#13;
2. Accessibility&#13;
Three kinds of access factors rated high with a large percentage&#13;
oerall, though not uniformly so across the groups: ease of access by road&#13;
(57 percent), ease of access to main customers (51 percent), ease of&#13;
access to main suppliers (48 percent). Road access was especially&#13;
imporant among decentralizers (86 percent), while customer access was&#13;
important for births and, conversely, for only a minority of hinterland&#13;
moves. Access to an airport with a regular commercial service was really&#13;
only important to decentralizers (13 percent), while ease of access by&#13;
rail and access to a maritime port were important to only a small&#13;
minority.&#13;
(1) In the following paragraphs, the location factors used in the survey&#13;
are underlined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
3. Government Influences&#13;
The various influences of state and local governments on the&#13;
choice of new locations were relatively unimportant, especially for&#13;
births. Guidance and requirements of state or federal government bodies&#13;
was a major or decisive factor for only eight percent of all firms, rising&#13;
to 13 percent for the suburbanizing group. Guidance and requirements of&#13;
financial institutions exerted no locational pressure at all on new&#13;
plants, a somewhat surprising fact considering that these institutions are&#13;
the prime source of lending for industrial companies in Brazil.&#13;
Incentives offered by the municipality were also of little importance.&#13;
Other factors in this group had an impact only on a minority of some sub-&#13;
groups: land and infrastructure provision on hinterland moves, the&#13;
presence of industrial districts on moves outside the metro area,&#13;
assistance from municipal authorities on the decentralizing firms with Sao&#13;
Paulo origins and hinterland destinations.&#13;
4. Urban Services&#13;
Overall, the availability of private support services and access&#13;
to key public utilities were important for many more firms in choosing&#13;
locations than were the influences of government -- though services were&#13;
cited by a minority and key utilities by a majority of firms. Of the&#13;
three types of services given any importance, accessibility to maintenance&#13;
services, technical assistance, etc. was of major or decisive importance&#13;
to 26 percent of all firms, and accessibility to industrial engineering&#13;
consulting firms, accounting and auditing, and computing services to ten&#13;
percent. Both kinds of services were of greater importance to across city&#13;
moves within Sao Paulo. Accessibility to employment agencies specializing&#13;
in temporary help was of little concern to anyone.&#13;
Among public utilities, availability and reliability of electric&#13;
power, closely followed by availability of telephone and telex facilities,&#13;
were both cited by a large majority of firms, particularly those moving to&#13;
the suburbs or out of the metro area. Conversely, the availability of&#13;
water for industrial use was somewhat more important to the across city&#13;
moves than to the exurban group. Adequate provision for the disposal of&#13;
industrial waste was a minor concern. Availability of public transport&#13;
serving the site was much more important, particularly for the across city&#13;
movese&#13;
5. Site Factors&#13;
Among the site factors1, the existence of a suitable plot and&#13;
availability of space for future expansion were most important, cited by a&#13;
majority of branch and transfer moves, with the space factor being most&#13;
often cited. Plot suitability had its greatest impact on decentralizing&#13;
moves, a fact tied to the higher numbers in the city renting their&#13;
facilities. Though of relatively minor importance to all groups, the&#13;
existence of a suitable building to purchase was somewhat more important&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to births. The possibility of leasing existing property was considerably&#13;
more important to births, and much more important to the across city&#13;
transfers and branches and suburbanizers than to more decentralizing&#13;
moves. Cost of land turned out to be surprisingly low in importance&#13;
overall, though it was of major or decisive importance for a majority of&#13;
suburbanizing and exurbanizing firms.&#13;
6. Other Factors&#13;
Of the remaining five pull factors, personal and family reasons&#13;
of the owner (25 percent) was the most important, especially for hinter-&#13;
land moves. Absence of competition for the company's products was of&#13;
little importance. The attraction of a region with tradition in this&#13;
sector was cited by 20 percent of hinterland moves, but fewer in all other&#13;
groups. Health facilities were cited by 17 percent of all firms. The&#13;
personal preference of executives and managers (12 percent) was cited&#13;
about equally by both across city moves and decentralizers, perhaps&#13;
reflecting a split in opinion on the merits of metropolitan life.&#13;
7. Single Decisive Factors&#13;
Asked to isolate a single decisive location factor, the majority&#13;
of firms chose not to do so, reflecting the complex, multi-attribute&#13;
nature of plant locational choice. Company managers and owners clearly&#13;
recognize that they were forced to evaluate a series of trade-offs among&#13;
factors for each alternative location considered.&#13;
B. Locational Push Factors&#13;
A second set of queries offered a choice of 30 push factors&#13;
encouraging the search for a new site. As with the pull factors, only a&#13;
small number emerged as dominant: the need to increase production,&#13;
existing premises fully occupied, a desire for internal reorganization,&#13;
and the introduction of a new line of products. Not surprisingly, growth&#13;
and expansion constitute the strongest pressures to move, but a range of&#13;
problems and opportunities also play a role. The percentages quoted below&#13;
do not, of course, refer to the birth group of firms.&#13;
1. Expansion&#13;
To permit increased production of products previously manufact-&#13;
ured was cited by 81 percent of all transfer and branch moves as a major&#13;
or decisive factor encouraging the search for a new location, with little&#13;
variation in this percentage across the four groups of firms. Nor was&#13;
there much variation from the overall proportion of 44 percent citing to&#13;
permit the introduction of a new line of products in the same area of&#13;
activity.  A third reason, to start operations in another area of&#13;
activity, was important for only four percent of the firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20 Access&#13;
Only one of the five access factors, access to markets, was&#13;
chosen with any frequency, and even here the percentages were low. The&#13;
previous unit was very far from the markets previously served and/or form&#13;
new potential markets was most important to hinterland moves (nine&#13;
percent) and hardly at all to across city transfers (three percent). A&#13;
mere one to two percent cited each of the other four reasons offered: the&#13;
previous unit was very far from current and/or potential suppliers of&#13;
components, *..from sources of raw materials, ...from suppliers of&#13;
industrial and business services; and, the location of the company's&#13;
markets changed.&#13;
3. Labor&#13;
Labor difficulties were only slightly more important than access&#13;
factors as inducements to movement. A small minority of all groups cited&#13;
the following, in descending order of importance: difficulty of finding&#13;
skilled labor at the previous location (eight percent), high labor costs&#13;
(six percent), and difficulty in recruiting administratione&#13;
percent). Trade union difficulties were uniformly unimportant. Some&#13;
variations in sub-groups revealed that labor costs are more important as&#13;
an inducement to decentralizing plants and that the problem of finding&#13;
skilled labor is of markedly higher concern to plants moving within the&#13;
hinterland.&#13;
4. Building and Site&#13;
Building and site factors show the same high percentages as&#13;
expansion factors, with which they are closely related. The two dominant&#13;
factors are the desire for internal reorganization such as physical re-&#13;
arrangement of equipment, introduction of machinery, etc. (62 percent) and&#13;
the need for more space because the previous premises were fully occupied&#13;
(81 percent). The other factors in this group were much less important:&#13;
the two other physical attributes of the previous site -- the necessity to&#13;
remodel or rebuild for reasons of safety (ten percent), and increasing&#13;
traffic congestion in the vicinity (14 percent), a factor that doubled in&#13;
importance for suburbanizers over moves within the central metro area, and&#13;
nearly tripled for decentralizing moves; two cost factors - unfavorable&#13;
terms on which the premises were leased (13 percent) and cost of land (14&#13;
percent), the latter relatively more important for the decentralizers;&#13;
finally, two opposing pressures -- the opportunity to dispose of the&#13;
previous premises on attractive terms and eviction, which were both&#13;
relatively unimportant.&#13;
5. Government Actions&#13;
Of the three types of government action that provide direct&#13;
incentives for industrial movement: expropriation for public use,&#13;
pollution controls and enforcement of zoning laws, none were important for&#13;
more than a small minority of firms. Pollution controls, however, played&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
the most significant role, especially for those leaving the urban area.&#13;
Expropriation (three percent overall) was more important to the suburban&#13;
group (ten percent), and zoning rules (four percent) rose to 11 percent&#13;
for decentralizers.&#13;
6. Other Factors&#13;
Among the remaining four push factors, only community opposition&#13;
(five percent) and personal reasons of the owner (six percent) were&#13;
Important to a minority. Difficulties with the supply of electricity was&#13;
important to only two percent of the hinterland moves and to no one else,&#13;
while the factor of combining scattered units was important to four&#13;
percent of the decentralizers and to no one else.&#13;
7. Single Decisive Factors&#13;
Once again the majority of firms chose not to isolate a single&#13;
decisive factor. Of those who did indicate decisive push factors,&#13;
however, there was more of a tendency for results to cluster than in the&#13;
case of the factors attracting plants to new locations. Two factors stand&#13;
out: increased production (23 percent and lack of space for expansion in&#13;
the previous premises (19 percent). The number of factors that received&#13;
high percentages as important factros but low ones as the single decisive&#13;
factor suggests the complex interaction of pressures leading to movement&#13;
decisions.&#13;
C. Breakdown by Industrial Factors&#13;
The final sections of the analyses of both pull and push factors&#13;
consider the results through sub-dividing the firms by industrial sector,&#13;
as well as by key characteristics of the new plants such as ownership,&#13;
size, capital and space intensity, and market orientation.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Metropolitan Sao Paulo in Brazil, with a population of&#13;
aproximately 12.5 million, is the most populous city in the developing&#13;
world after Mexico City. In 1950, its population was 2.7 million. The&#13;
city grew particularly rapidly through the 1950s, at 6.1 percent per&#13;
annum, falling to 5.4 percent annually in the 1960s and 4.4 percent in the&#13;
1970s.&#13;
Sao Paulo city is the major manufacturing center in Brazil,&#13;
accounting for nearly half the industrial capacity of the nation. It&#13;
received a strong stimulus from the so-called "miracle" years of 1967-74&#13;
when the Brazilian economy was growing at an average rate of 11.2 percent&#13;
per annum. This growth pressure, coming on top of previous rapid&#13;
expansion, resulted in a marked increase in pollution and congestion and&#13;
in declining standards in public health and amenity.(l) These worsening&#13;
urban conditions encouraged a spontaneous decentralization of industrial&#13;
plants to surrounding areas of Sao Paulo State and into adjoining states,&#13;
a decentralization made possible by extensive public sector infrastructure&#13;
investments in secondary cities in the 1960s and early 1970s. This trend&#13;
is now being fostered by a pollution control policy imposed on industry i&#13;
metropolitan Sao Paulo, and by limited incentives offered in centers in&#13;
the non-metropolitan hinterland.&#13;
This paper reports on the preliminary findings of a survey of&#13;
581 firms involved in this decentralization process, both within the metro&#13;
area to the suburbs, and beyond it to the hinterland. The firms are all&#13;
in the manufacturing sectors of the economy. Each has opened a new plant&#13;
in a new location in the state between 1977 and 1979. The survey is part&#13;

of a larger study of industrial development and urban growth in the State&#13;
of Sao Paulo undertaken by the World Bank. Information from the&#13;
industrial location aurvey has been complemented by analysis of sets of&#13;
secondary date from the Census of Population and Industry and other&#13;
sources. The survey was performed in cooperation with the Economics&#13;
Research Institute of the University of Sao Paulo. In addition to the&#13;
location factor questions discussed here, information was elicited on the&#13;
ways In which companies reached a final choice of new site, on problems&#13;
encountered moving in, as well as on aspects of the experience of the&#13;
plants in their new locationso&#13;
One of the chief criticisms which can be laid at the door of&#13;
location survey analysts In the past is that they have failed to&#13;
adequately isolate factors, and have paid insufficient attention to&#13;
multivariate associations between location factor responses. Further work&#13;
on this data base will examine these more complex patterns. This&#13;
preliminary paper, however, uses only the more simple two way associations&#13;
between location factore, on the one hand, and plant and company&#13;
characteristics on the other.&#13;
11 DECENTRALIZATION OF INDUSTRY FROM&#13;
METROPOLITAN ARIAS IN LDCs&#13;
An examination of the reasons why manufacturing has begun to&#13;
decentralize from metropolitan Sao Paulo and why particular hinterland&#13;
locations have been chosen for the new plants is timely for policy&#13;
formulation by the State of Sao Paulo. The pressures of urban growth&#13;
within the metro area have led planners to consider whether the state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
or federal government should more actively promote decentralization of&#13;
manufacturing within the state. The federal government already offers&#13;
significant financial incentives for long range (1500 miles plus)&#13;
decentralization to the relatively poor but populous states of the&#13;
Brazilian Northeast; and two of the states adjoining Sao Paulo, Minas&#13;
Gerais to the north and Parana to the southwest, both offer inducements to&#13;
attract investments by Sao Paulo based companies. With half of the&#13;
industrial output of the nation concentrated in metro Sao Paulo, the state&#13;
government perhaps need not worry about this competition, while a planned&#13;
development of the state hinterland which includes an employment&#13;
decentralization strategy may relieve the pressures of urban and&#13;
industrial growth in the metropolitan area, while improving the equity and&#13;
efficiency of growth in the secondary centers.&#13;
However, this research is also intended to be of wider&#13;
interest. Rightly or wrongly, efficiently or inefficiently, many&#13;
governments around the world have introduced policies to restrain the&#13;
growth of their largest cities. Frequently, the keystone of such policies&#13;
has been a strategy of decentralization of manufacturing industry.&#13;
Experience suggests that in many, or most cases, such a strategy has been&#13;
introduced without sufficient understanding of the market pressures&#13;
operating on the choice of new locations by industry, or of the most&#13;
effective leverage points for policy intervention. Nor has the extremely&#13;
complex issue of whether such a strategy is advisable on purely economic&#13;
cost-benefit or efficiency grounds been successfully tackled to date. To&#13;
aid these policy decisions, there is need for further detailed empirical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
research. Its size, its growth and the recent but increasing pressures&#13;
for decentralization have made Sao Paulo a leading candidate as a case&#13;
study for work on these themes.&#13;
Why are so many governments enthusiastically embracing policies&#13;
to restrain the growth of their largest cities? It is only possible to&#13;
give the briefest of replies to this question here, but thinking about&#13;
both the goals and objectives of such policies provides the widest context&#13;
for considering the survey results later in the paper. The other relevant&#13;
context is the recent history of urban and economic development in the&#13;
state of Sao Paulo, which will be reviewed in Section III of the paper.&#13;
Although birth rates are falling in many less developed&#13;
countries, the projected growth in the urban populations of these nations&#13;
as a group is awesome: in excess of one billion additional urban&#13;
residents in the last two decades of this century (United Nations,&#13;
1980)o This is more than twice as many people absorbed by the cities of&#13;
the more developed nations in the last few decades. The increase will&#13;
raise the proportion of the total population in LDCs living in cities of&#13;
more than one million population from 10.6 percent to 18.7 percent. In&#13;
Latin America this increase will be from 27.3 percent to 37.5 percent by&#13;
the year 2000 Expressed another way, by the year 2000, cities of five&#13;
million people and more in LDCs could contain nearly 500 million&#13;
residents, an increase of some 300 percent over the 1980 figure.(2) It is&#13;
these very large cities which are the prime focus of concern by LDC&#13;
governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The priorities of governments vary, and there are differences in&#13;
the real and perceived problems that governments address in their&#13;
policies. In their concern about very large cities, politicians and urban&#13;
policy makers in national governments and in city halls are motivated by&#13;
two sets of problems. The first set is frequently seen as having to do&#13;
with population size per se but probably has more to do with high growth&#13;
rates of both population and disposable income. The problems here come&#13;
from congestion and pollution and chronic overload in the capacities of&#13;
public infrastructures and utility services. Undoubtedly some policy&#13;
makers associate metropolitan scale development with rising expectations&#13;
that are only met for a minority and which therefore encourage crime and&#13;
social unrest.&#13;
The second set of problems is rather different, having to do&#13;
with the relative size and prosperity of the large metropolitan center as&#13;
compared with the secondary and tertiary urban areas in the hinterland of&#13;
the city region or in other regions of the nation as a whole. Tribal&#13;
differences, sensitive frontiers and movements for political devolution -&#13;
all encourage a national government to worry about inter-regional equity&#13;
as well as (and maybe more so) than inter-personal equity.&#13;
The problems that cities in LDCs have in growing, and in&#13;
providing shelter, employment and public services equitably and&#13;
efficiently have recently been reviewed by Linn (1980). The general theme&#13;
of urban growth and the need for spatial policies at both the inter-city&#13;
and the inter-regional scales in LDCs has been taken up and reviewed by&#13;
Renaud (1981).(3) Does the evidence in general suggest that policies to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
slow clty growth are a 'good thing?" The knowledge we have suggests that&#13;
in both economic and policy effectiveness terms the answer is probably&#13;
"no," in the sense that such policies rarely achieve the goals that policy&#13;
makers think they are addressingo However, when a decentralization policy&#13;
seeks to use the growth of the metropolitan area as a resource to promote&#13;
the growth of secondary cities and/or lagging regions, then the policy can&#13;
be more successful in an operational sense and may indeed simultaneously&#13;
promote economic efficiency. Investment in the manufacturing sector is&#13;
usually the key target for such a policy. (Townroe, 1979b)o&#13;
The policy instruments that have been used to promote the&#13;
decentralization of employment from large metropolitan areas in LDCs have&#13;
very much followed the models developed in MDCs to influence flows of&#13;
spatially mobile investment towards lagging regions and to New Town type&#13;
developments. The underlying syndromes are different but, to the extent&#13;
that similar cures are possible, similar policy instruments may be used,&#13;
other things being equal. The Instruments include fiscal and non-fiscal&#13;
weapons: grants, tax allowances, tax reductions, free or cheap land and&#13;
buildings in the reception areas, tax penalties or licenses in the&#13;
etropolitan "seed bed0" The strengths and weaknesses of thesevarious&#13;
instruments have been examined in the context of regional development&#13;
policies in many developed countries (eogo, the review by Allen et al1&#13;
[1980J of the EoE.Co nations)0 The pros and cons of the use of each&#13;
instrument, individually or in combination in LDCs, are less clear&#13;
(Townroe, 1979b). Three lessons from Western Europe are inescapable0&#13;
First, that provision of the relevant infrastructures in the target urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
areas for the decentralization of industrial plants is a necessary but not&#13;
a sufficient condition for success. Second, that policies of inducements&#13;
are much more effective when complemented by an instrument of penalty&#13;
directed at industry in general, or at least at new investments, located&#13;
in the core city. And third, that the specific natures of the sticks and&#13;
carrots used, greatly influence both the direct and the indirect&#13;
consequences of their use, independently of their scale or intensity.&#13;
Although inducements other than that of cheap land are not&#13;
offered by city authorities in the secondary cities of the State of Sao&#13;
Paulo, conditions for the other two lessons from Europe are met.&#13;
Extensive investments in relevant infrastructures (power, roads,&#13;
telecommunications, water, graded sites, etc.) have been made in most of&#13;
the urban centers above a population of about 30,000. The situation has&#13;
been transformed over the last fifteen years or so. And the push element&#13;
in the metropolitan area is there in the form of the pollution control&#13;
policy, introduced for new investments in 1977. These are two of the&#13;
elements, along with changing factor prices, which have led to the&#13;
principal secondary cities expanding their manufacturing employment base&#13;
in the 1970s at a faster rate than metropolitan Sao Paulo, a swing round&#13;
from the pattern through the 1960s. Population growth rates have modified&#13;
to follow, yielding a situation approaching what Richardson has termed&#13;
Polarization Reversal, at the city region level (Richardson, 1980).&#13;

III. THE GROWTH OF SAO PAULO&#13;
It was not until the early 19th century that commercial&#13;
agriculture developed beyond the coastal mountains in what is now the&#13;
State of Sao Paulo. Growing coffee for export was the major stimulus to&#13;
this development. The agricultural frontier was pushed inland and within&#13;
100 years, by 1920, Sao Paulo was producing 80% of the coffee in Brazil&#13;
and 60% of the total world supply. The market center for the coffee&#13;
growers was the city of Sao Paulo, located on a plateau only 70 kilometers&#13;
from the coast but nearly 3,000 feet up from sea level. The city had a&#13;
population of only 30,000 or so by 1870, but the opening of a rail link to&#13;
the coastal port of Santos greatly improved access to world markets and by&#13;
1920 the city had a population of 580,000 in a state population of 41/2&#13;
million.&#13;
Through the twentieth century the range of agricultural products&#13;
of the state of Sao Paulo has widened away from coffee to include cattle,&#13;
soya beans, citrus fruits, sugar cane, rice and maize. The growth of&#13;
agriculture was stimulated in the early years of the century by the policy&#13;
of subsidized immigration. Slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888, and&#13;
the coffee plantation owners turned to the Mediterranean countries of&#13;
Europe and to Japan for additional labor. These immigrants, however,&#13;
brought with them more than just rural skills. Manufacturing capability,&#13;
initially to serve agriculture, started to develop in the state. Profits&#13;
from the plantation owners and the effects of isolation in two world wars&#13;
"ostered this capability. From the inter-war period but especially after&#13;
d War II, the Brazilian government directly encouraged industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development and by 1950 Sao Paulo was the major manufacturing center in&#13;
the country: 577,000 people worked in the manufacturing sector in the&#13;
state in 1950.&#13;
Growth in manufacturing output and employment, and in the&#13;
population of the state, city and metropolitan area, has been very rapid&#13;
since 1950. By 1975 the numbers employed in manufacturing in the state&#13;
had risen to 1,815,000. The growth rates of population within the state&#13;
are shown in Table One. The divisions of the state used in the Table&#13;
correspond with those shown on Map One.&#13;
Table I shows that the residents of the State of Sao Paulo have&#13;
increased both from immigration, new family formation, and lower death&#13;
rates, at a faster rate than either the national population or the&#13;
population of the rest of the South East Region of Brazil (the States of&#13;
Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro) in each of the last three decades, even&#13;
though the overall growth rate has been slowing. Within the state there&#13;
have been marked changes in the period. The agricultural frontier was&#13;
still being extended in the '50s, but as this extension of the cultivated&#13;
acreage stopped and farming became more capital intensive, the rural&#13;
population growth in the hinterland of the state slowed. As the Table&#13;
shows, the population growth rate of the city of Sao Paulo and the&#13;
metropolitan area also slowed through the period, even though the absolute&#13;
increments to the population increased. By the 1970s the fastest rates of&#13;
population growth were actually occurring in the larger urban centers of&#13;
the Ring. Campinas, for example, grew at 5.7 percent per annum between&#13;

1970 and 1980. The high growth had therefore decentralized from the urban&#13;
portion of the metropolitan area outside the city of Sao Paulo, from the&#13;
suburbs to the outer metropolitan area.&#13;
The spatial pattern of urban growth in Sao Paulo has been&#13;
influenced by the topography of the landscape, reinforced by key&#13;
infrastructure investments, especially in highways. The coastal strip has&#13;
relatively little land suitable for industrial development. Growth&#13;
therefore occurred behind the mountains on the plateau at the center of&#13;
the area defined as the metropolitan area. This area is well served for&#13;
drainage and water supply as well as with hydro-power resources and easy&#13;
communications with Rio de Janeiro along the Paraiba Valley, though these&#13;
factors are no longer as important as they were half a century ago.&#13;
Indeed, the spread of the built up area of Sao Paulo is now running into&#13;
mountains to the north and the extensive system of reservoirs to the&#13;
south. Growth has therefore been channelled to the west and to the east&#13;
and southeast over the past thirty years or so. Improved highway&#13;
connections are now encouraging radial growth outside the metro area,&#13;
along the earlier development axis to the east and to Sorocaba in the&#13;
west, but most especially to Jundiai, Campinas and Americana to the&#13;
northwest along the line of the principal communications route to the&#13;
interior. This north westerly growth salient will be the most important&#13;
area for the development of manufacturing industry in the next two decades&#13;
or so.&#13;
In 1970, the State of Sao Paulo had 19 percent of the population&#13;
of Brazil, but contributed 58 percent of industrial value added and housed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
48 percent of the national industrial labor force. Given that in 1978 the&#13;
GNP per capita in Brazil was $1,570 and that imports were only eight&#13;
percent of GDP, a broad spectrum of manufacturing industries in Sao Paulo&#13;
is implied. Indeed no single sector of 22 two digit sectors accounted for&#13;
more than 13 percent of value added or employment in 1975, the year of the&#13;
last industrial census. In 1950, the textiles and clothing sectors&#13;
accounted for 34.5 percent of the jobs in manufacturing in the state. By&#13;
1975 this was down to 16.8 percent (although the absolute numbers had&#13;
increased). In contrast, metallurgy and machinery provided 12.8 percent&#13;
of the jobs in 1950, 26.7 percent in 1975. And electrical, communications&#13;
and transport products were up from 4.0 percent to 14.7 percent in the&#13;
same period. The metal working and engineering sectors are particularly&#13;
strongly represented among the companies decentralizing additions to&#13;
capacity.&#13;
The concentration of manufacturing within the state in the&#13;
metropolitan area of Sao Paulo has been declining over time. Table Two&#13;
shows the growth in manufacturing employment recorded in the Industrial&#13;
Census years of 1960, 1970 and 1975 for different areas of the state. The&#13;
areas correspond with Map One and are defined in Annex B. Table Two also&#13;
shows the spatial pattern of construction licenses issued by the pollution&#13;
control agency for the years 1977-79.&#13;
Within the metropolitan area, the central municipality of the&#13;
City of Sao Paulo has continued to gain employment in manufacturing, but&#13;
with a declining share of the increment, has reduced its overall share in&#13;
the state total 1960 to 1975 from 55.7 percent to 45.8 percent. During&#13;

1977-79 the city only received 20.5 percent of the planned employment in&#13;
new establishments or expansions (although this figure does not allow for&#13;
increases in employment in existing establishments without additional&#13;
floor space constructed). Though strong growth in the metropolitan area&#13;
has come in the inner suburbs, with an increase of 246,000 employees and a&#13;
percentage share gain of the state total from 13.3 percent in 1960 to 19.5&#13;
percent in 1975, this gain was not enough to prevent the overall share of&#13;
the metropolitan area from falling slightly. This share decline was&#13;
principally due to the strong growth of 148,000 additional employees in&#13;
manufacturing in the larger cities of the Ring area, but also in part due&#13;
to growth in manufacturing in the smaller hinterland cities. This growth&#13;
outside the metropolitan area is, of course, one of the principal driving&#13;
forces behind the rise in the population growth rates in the Ring area in&#13;
the three decades since 1950, as shown in Table I.&#13;
IV. THE 1980 INDUSTRIAL LOCATION SURVEY&#13;
The population of companies in the manufacturing sector of&#13;
industry in the State of Sao Paulo, which opened new production plants in&#13;
new locations in 1977, 1978 and 1979, was obtained from the pollution&#13;
control agency of the state, Companhia de Tecnologia e Saneamento&#13;
Ambiental (CETESB). All companies have to obtain a license to invest in&#13;
industrial plant, equipment and buildings, and another license to start&#13;
production. The University of Sao Paulo team identified 1961 new plant&#13;
openings from this license file from 8022 permissions given across 183 of&#13;
the 571 municipalities of the state. From this population of new plant&#13;
openings, a sample of 600 company names were taken for the interviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
The sample was weighted by distance and by plant size.(4) All new plants&#13;
moving more than 50 km and employing 50 or more were included. The&#13;
remaining 434 all employed ten or more and were selected with a bias&#13;
against the smaller plants establishing at sites within metropolitan Sao&#13;
Paulo. The responses reported in the following sections of this paper&#13;
have been weighted to reflect the sampling pattern, on the basis of the&#13;
581 useable interviews obtained. The interviews were conducted by an&#13;
experienced team normally engaged in cost-of-living studies. The&#13;
interview appointments were arranged with the assistance of the&#13;
Coordenadoria de Acao Regional under the Secretariat of the Interior of&#13;
the state government of Sao Paulo, joint sponsors of the survey. This&#13;
official intervention explains the high response rate. Interviews were&#13;
normally held with the most senior executive in the plant concerned,&#13;
although the interviews for some branch plants were held at the&#13;
supervisory headquarters.&#13;
The new plants in the survey fall into three principal&#13;
categories: 122 were "births," the opening of new companies, where the&#13;
location concerned was the only location of the company; 91 "branch&#13;
plants," the opening of a new subsidiary or production unit of a&#13;
corporation or group of companies;   and 368 were "transfer moves,"&#13;
Involving the closure of a plant elsewhere. Of these transfers 300 were&#13;
the sole units of an independent company, but 21 could be classed as the&#13;
principal plant of a multi-plant company, and a further 47 were member&#13;
plants of a corporation or a group of companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
The origins and destinations of these categories of new plant&#13;
opening are shown in Table III. The table shows the high proportion of&#13;
branch and transfer moves in the survey which were very local, within the&#13;
same municipality. Only 48 percent of the transfers moved to another of&#13;
the six regions into which the state has been divided, and two thirds of&#13;
these were decentralizing transfers from the urban core of the&#13;
metropolitan area (the municipality of the city of Sao Paulo) to the&#13;
"Inner GSP region (ten municipalities forming the remainder of the&#13;
continuous built up area within the metropolitan region). Only 29 percent&#13;
of the branch plant moves changed regions, and one third of these were to&#13;
the suburban area. Decentralization outside the metropolitan region is&#13;
concentrated among plants originating in the city of Sao Paulo, a&#13;
decentralization reinforced by the emergence of new enterprises (births),&#13;
some 49 percent of which located outside the metro area. The Table only&#13;
shows the distribution of the surveyed firms and is based on a weighted&#13;
sample. The underlying distribution of mobile industry in the State of&#13;
Sao Paulo is therefore even more strongly focused on local moves within&#13;
municipalities and on suburbanizing moves within the metropolitan area&#13;
than the picture offered by this Table. The changing growth rates of&#13;
manufacturing employment lying behind the population growth figures of&#13;
Table I do suggest, however, that decentralizing pressures are growing and&#13;
that more and more companies will be looking for plant locations outside&#13;
the metro area in the future.&#13;

The three categories of plant opening are shown by location of&#13;
plant In Table IV, together with the corporate status of the plant and its&#13;
ownership. The majority of the firms in the survey were privately owned&#13;
with Brazilian shareholders. Three firms had an element of public sector&#13;
capital in the voting shares. The 12 percent of firms classified as&#13;
foreign have a minlmum of 25 percent of the voting capital controlled from&#13;
outside Brazil. The distribution of the plants across the industrial&#13;
subdivisions of the manufacturing sector is very wide: 96 lie in the&#13;
traditional group of industries which includes food processing, beverages,&#13;
leather and wood products; 109 in the intermediate group of textiles,&#13;
clothing, rubber products, printing and publishing; 286 in the engineering&#13;
and metal goods groups; and 90 in the modern group of chemicals, plastics&#13;
and pharmaceuticals. Of the firms surveyed, 37 percent had a planned&#13;
employment of more than 100 employees at the time of choosing the new&#13;
location, six percent more than 500. At the time of the interview, only&#13;
26 percent employed more than 100; three percent more than 500; 102 had&#13;
not opened their new plant at the new location at the time of the&#13;
interview (implying a current employment of zero), and 36 percent of the&#13;
total currently employed less than 50 at the new location. The smaller&#13;
new plants were concentrated in two groups: those close in to the center&#13;
of the metropolitan area, and those opening up-state in the hinterland&#13;
region. Large cities in the ring region and the outer areas of the&#13;
metropolitan region received proportionately more of the larger new&#13;
plants.&#13;

V. FACTORS IN THE CHOICE OF NEW LOCATIONS&#13;
The 581 plant openings in the Sao Paulo location survey include&#13;
births, transfers and branches. The locations chosen by these companies&#13;
vary from the central areas of a major metropolis to quite small rural&#13;
towns. For some, the new sites are in areas very close to existing or&#13;
past units of the company, or the owner's home. For others, a migration&#13;
over a considerable distance to a new area was involved. Past studies of&#13;
industrial location decision-making (Townroe, 1979a) suggest that there&#13;
will be considerable variety in what is considered important among the&#13;
many locational attributes of the new site by these various categories of&#13;
move. For example, one may expect aspects of urban agglomeration&#13;
externalities to be more important for those choosing sites within the&#13;
metropolitan area than those choosing smaller cities. For firms choosing&#13;
new sites a long way from the metro area it might be anticipated that&#13;
communications and transportation considerations would rank high.&#13;
Past location studies also make it clear that within these&#13;
movement categories, the relative importance of different location factors&#13;
will vary with other attributes of the plants and companies involved.&#13;
What is important to a small firm is not so important for a large firm.&#13;
Labor intensive or space intensive technologies have particular locational&#13;
requirements. What looks important to a locally owned concern may not be&#13;
judged so critical by an incoming multi-national. The list of possible&#13;
distinctions in plant and company attributes could be very long. In the&#13;
presentation of the results of the Sao Paulo survey, a prior judgment on&#13;
the most important distinctions was reached on the basis of previous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
studies of industrial location behavior. These distinctions have been&#13;
used In the first five large tables In Annex A.&#13;
Each of Tables Al to A7 lists 38 reasons that a company may give&#13;
for choosing a new location, split under six headings: labor supply9&#13;
accessibility, government influences9 urban services, site characteristics&#13;
and 'others.' The reasons listed include standard questions asked in&#13;
every industrial location survey (e.go, access to suppliers, plentiful&#13;
labor, personal reasons of owner, etc.), together with questions&#13;
reflecting the particular phase of industrial development now occurring in&#13;
the State of Sao Paulo (e.g., the questions on urban services and&#13;
assistance from the municipal governments)0&#13;
The first Table, Al, gives the percentage specifying each factor&#13;
as of 'major importance' or a 'decisive factor' (as compared with "no or&#13;
little importance") for the 122 births, weighted up according to the&#13;
sampling frame. Table A2 is based on the transfer and branch plant moves&#13;
in the survey moving within the City of Sao Paulo or within the&#13;
municipalities of the Inner Metropolitan Area. Table A3 provides the&#13;
location factors for plants moving out from the City of Sao Paulo to the&#13;
suburbs of the Inner Metro Area. Plants moving out from both these areas&#13;
to the rest of the Metro Area and beyond, the 'exurbanizers,' underlie&#13;
Table A40 The remaining moves within and between the municipalities of&#13;
the Outer Area and the rest of the state are In Table A5. Table A6&#13;
provides totals for Tables A2-5 and makes the distinction between&#13;
transfers and branch plants. Table A7 differentiates the location factor&#13;
responses by the Industrial sector of the new plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Tables Al to A5 have the percentages for each location factor&#13;
split by seven corporate attributes or 'base variables." Plant size is&#13;
measured by dividing employment planned at the time of choosing the new&#13;
location into less than and more than 75 employees. Capital intensity is&#13;
considered high when the net worth per planned employee is over Cr$400.000&#13;
(in 71 plants it was less than Cr$100.000 and in 96 it was over&#13;
Cr$1.000.000). Space intensity is high when the floor area of the factory&#13;
building exceeds 30 square meters per planned employee (of the 468 plants,&#13;
in 61 it was less than ten and in 67 it was over 75).   The classification&#13;
of markets is based on replies by interviewed firms to the question: "The&#13;
market for the products of this plant can be described as...". The next&#13;
two categories (building and factory) divide newly chosen buildings by&#13;
whether they are owned or leased, whether they are new or old, and, if&#13;
old, whether they do or do not require major modification. Finally, the&#13;
firms in the survey were asked if, compared to the average company in that&#13;
sector of industry, they would describe thier technology as "More Modern,"&#13;
"Similar" or "Older." Further possible divisions available in the survey&#13;
returns, but not used here, include the size of the parent group of&#13;
companies, the degree of competition in the sector, the ownership of the&#13;
company, the geographical scope of the location analysis undertaken, and&#13;
type of incentives granted, if any. In all of these tables the phi&#13;
statistic is used to test for significance. This is a modification of the&#13;
chi squared statistic, appropriate for 2x2 tables. It ranges between 0&#13;
and 1, adjusting for the number of cases included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(a) Labor Supply&#13;
The first group of reasons given to the interviewed companies to&#13;
rate for importance in choosing the site for the new plant was concerned&#13;
with labor supply. Since the majority of companies opening a new plant&#13;
are doing so for reasons of expansion, an expansion which many hope will&#13;
continue in the future, an adequate supply of labor in the right numbers&#13;
at the right price and with the right skills is a fundamental&#13;
consideration in choosing a plant site. However, Tables Al-5 show that&#13;
labor factors, although important for a large number of firms, are not&#13;
rated important as frequently as other factors for each of our five groups&#13;
of new plants. Among the 38 location factors listed, in all the transfers&#13;
and branches the factor of "plentiful" labor was fourth in the proportion&#13;
rating it as of 'major" or "decisive' importance, and the factor "with&#13;
required skill" was twelfth overallo This is in contrast to surveys in&#13;
the U.K. and the U.S0 and must reflect the labor abundant characteristics&#13;
of the Brazilian economy and the high wages in the Sao Paulo manufacturing&#13;
sectors as compared to other sectors, formal and informal.&#13;
The most important labor requirement cited by firms is that the&#13;
supply be plentiful, closely followed by the concern about available&#13;
skills. The role of these two factors is set out in more detail in Table&#13;
V0 They were decisive location factors for only nine percent or less in&#13;
all but two of the five location subgroups, and in contrast were of no&#13;
importance to large numbers of firms in all the groups. The high&#13;

rating given to plentiful labor by both births and moves within the&#13;
metropolitan area is interesting, as is the relatively low priority given&#13;
to requlred skills by the suburbanizing and exurbanizing groups.&#13;
Other labor characteristics are of much lower priority in all of&#13;
the groups, with the exception of cheap labor for births (29 percent),&#13;
which reflects the financial pressures associated with small size and&#13;
capital commitments. The two education factors, the availability of&#13;
technical training facilities and the quality of basic schooling, were&#13;
relatively more important to the moves outside Sao Paulo and to the&#13;
exurban group. The question about trade unions elicited a very small&#13;
response, reflecting the current restrictions on industrial trade unions&#13;
In Brazil. Competition for labor seemed to worry few except 12 percent of&#13;
the decentralizing transfer and branch moves.&#13;
In looking across the seven plant characteristics in the Annex&#13;
Tables Al to A5, it will be seen that concern about a plentiful supply of&#13;
labor was more predominant among large new plants than small ones,&#13;
particularly among the exurban group -- as indeed might be expected. For&#13;
the births, plentiful labor was cited by noticeably higher proportions of&#13;
the less capital intensive and less space extensive firms; this pattern&#13;
was repeated, less emphatically, among the hinterland moves, but was&#13;
reversed among the suburbanizing group of transfers and branches. The&#13;
labor supply factor was relatively more important to births with a local&#13;
market orientation, as it was to exurban moves with local markets, and in&#13;
contrast, to suburban moves with a national market focus. No clear cause&#13;
and effect mechanism operates heree There are also strong differences in&#13;

four of the five groups where the labor supply factor shifted in&#13;
importance with the two building categories (own/lease and new/old). For&#13;
example, labor supply was quoted as important by a significantly high&#13;
proportion of those exurban movers owning their new building and obtaining&#13;
newly constructed premises rather than a 'second-hand' plant.&#13;
Important contrasts across the categories of the five subgroups&#13;
of new plants also emerge for the six other labor supply location&#13;
factors. A few examples illustrate differences that would be submerged in&#13;
the normal location survey which would fail to make these distinctions.&#13;
Cheap labor, not cited as an important factor overall, was of particular&#13;
concern to those births using modern technology in leased second-hand&#13;
premises. These findings reinforce the financial outlay point made&#13;
earlier. Cheap labor was also relatively more important to the large&#13;
capital intensive exurbanizing firms. In contrast, labor with required&#13;
skills was less important to the capital intensive firms, particularly&#13;
among the exurbanizing firms. Competition for labor only seemed to worry&#13;
less capital intensive births serving regional markets and using older&#13;
technology, suburban moves using older technology; and large, local market&#13;
serving, exurban moves with modern technology. The union activity&#13;
consideration was important to no more than six percent in any of the&#13;
subdivisions used. Education, on the other hand, in technical training&#13;
and in the quality of basic schooling, did provide some contrasts as a&#13;
locational variable. In the exurbanizing group, these two factors were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
noticeably cited more frequently by the national and foreign market&#13;
oriented firms which use modern technology, and so require a dependable&#13;
number of literate and trained workers.&#13;
(b) Accessibility&#13;
Proximity to both customers and suppliers ranked as location&#13;
factor of "major importance' or as "decisive" for approximately half of&#13;
all the groups except the local moves outside Sao Paulo. The contrast&#13;
between this group and the other three move groups is brought out in Table&#13;
VI. The Table also shows that access to customers is a decisive factor&#13;
for more firms (in all but one of the groups, than access to suppliers,&#13;
and that customer access is less often cited as of "no importance" by&#13;
births, reflecting, perhaps, the need of many small companies to locate&#13;
close to a dominant customer. These companies may have fewer customers&#13;
than suppliers, whereas in large companies the proportions are reversedo&#13;
Among the categories of firms, there are contrasts between these two&#13;
factors; for example, by capital intensity on the importance of suppliers,&#13;
and by location on the importance of customers. Among the exurban moves,,&#13;
perhaps the most interesting group for this type of question, contrasts&#13;
come with sector, size, capital intensity and building types on relative&#13;
importance of access to suppliers; and with size and capital intensity on&#13;
access to customers. Table VI also shows a strong contrast in the&#13;
importance of personal and family reasons of the owner, this factor being&#13;
decisive far more often for the hinterland moves (32 percent) exurbanizers&#13;
(15 percent) than for the other transfers and branches (seven and three&#13;
percent) or the births (12 percent). Among the other accessibility&#13;

factors, the importance of 'easy road access' stands out, particularly for&#13;
the exurbanizing group (86 percent). Radial location search out of&#13;
metropolitan areas along major highways is a well established phenomenon&#13;
In the industrial location literature. Only for subgroups of the across&#13;
city moves does the proportion citing this factor fall below 50 percent.&#13;
The importance of rail access does not rise above 18 percent in any of the&#13;
subgroups and categories. Ease of access to a maritime port and to an&#13;
airport with scheduled services were similarly unimportant factors&#13;
overall. These last three factors were classed as 'decisivew by only one&#13;
percent of the plants surveyed.&#13;
(c) Government Influences&#13;
Six questions were asked about the importance of the influences&#13;
that state and municipal governments would bring to bear on the locational&#13;
choice of firms. None were important for more than 28 percent of the&#13;
subgroups of firms, except the existence of industrial districts for the&#13;
small city local moves. The first government influence asked about was&#13;
the requirements of state or federal government agencies, such as the&#13;
federal industrial investment council aUd the state pollution control&#13;
agency. The second influence was that of guidance or requirements from a&#13;
government financial institution, these institutions (BNDE, BADESP,&#13;
etc.)(5) being the prime source of loan finance for industrial companies&#13;
in Brazil. The first influence was cited by more than 20 percent of the&#13;
suburban plants and was unimportant elsewhere. The second influence&#13;
exercised no locational pressure at all to any subgroups of new plants, a&#13;
result that is somewhat surprising. Perhaps these state owned financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
agencies are not worrying enough about the locational element in their&#13;
investment appraisals?&#13;
The remaining four questions on government influences are set&#13;
out in more detail in Table VII. Unspecified incentives offered by the&#13;
municipalities are unimportant In general, scoring noticeable percentages&#13;
only for the moves to locations outside the inner metro area. Among the&#13;
exurban group in particular, these incentives were relatively more&#13;
important for the large, capital intensive and space extensive firms,&#13;
serving non-local markets, using modern technology and owning rather than&#13;
leasing their buildings. Overall, municipal incentives were a decisive&#13;
factor for only two percent of the firms, and were of no importance to 85&#13;
percent. The question of whether grants of land, and free land filling&#13;
and grading, and the immediate provision of infrastructures was important&#13;
elicited a slightly stronger response; but again it was only cited by a&#13;
minority of firms choosing new locations outside the inner metro area. As&#13;
expected, this factor was cited only by firms constructing new factory&#13;
buildings which they own.&#13;
The existence of an industrial district was rated as a location&#13;
factor of major importance by ten percent of all firms surveyed and as&#13;
decisive by four percent. However, as Table VII shows, it was much more&#13;
important outside the inner metro area than within. It was a major or&#13;
decisive factor for 34 percent of the hinterland moves, being particularly&#13;
important for capital intensive units. It was of "no importance" to 94&#13;
percent of the across city moves within Sao Paulo.&#13;

The last question on government influences was fairly general,&#13;
asking about the importance of assistance from the municipal authorities&#13;
including the mayor. Again, as expected, this was more important outside&#13;
the metropolitan area. This factor reflects, of course, the enthusiasm of&#13;
the municipal authorities to attract new industry, a factor of particular&#13;
significance to local government in Brazil because of the dependence of&#13;
each municipality on an industrial tax for its revenue base.&#13;
(d) Urban Services&#13;
The urban services required by companies in a new location fall&#13;
into two groups -- private sector and public sector. The first three&#13;
factors enquired about under this heading concern private sector&#13;
services: access to maintenance services and technical assistance;&#13;
accessibility to engineering consulting firms, accounting/auditing and&#13;
computing services; and access to employment agencies specializing in&#13;
temporary help. Only the first of these was important to a minority&#13;
overall, and was a decisive factor for just 15 of the surveyed plants.&#13;
The other two factors were decisive for almost none of the plants&#13;
interviewed. The maintenance and technical services factor was relatively&#13;
important for large births and for large exurban moves. All three factors&#13;
are markedly more important to the across city moves than to others, and&#13;
the pattern of responses in general for these three factors suggests that&#13;
if they are important for the new plant, a location within the&#13;
metropolitan area will be more attractive. The proportion of plants&#13;
citing importance for all three falls off as the destination locations go&#13;
away from the center of Sao Paulo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
=34e&#13;
The next five factors are related to the provision of&#13;
utilities. 'Availability and reliability of supply of electric power' was&#13;
a major factor for a majority of plants in the survey, 58 percent&#13;
overall. It was particularly Important for decentralizing moves, perhaps&#13;
based on past unhappy experiences, being a decisive factor for 36 percent;&#13;
but was also cited by 66 percent of the suburban moves. It was&#13;
particularly important to firms moving into existing buildings outside the&#13;
inner metro area. There was no clear relation to size of plant except&#13;
among the exurban groupo While electric power was an issue to a minority&#13;
of the across city moves, the availability and quality of the public water&#13;
supply for industrial uses was of importance to a majority, as well to&#13;
births (Table VIII). Proximity to springs has been an important&#13;
locational consideration in the past in Sao Paulo state, but the results&#13;
here show that it was rated of major importance by only nine percent of&#13;
the plants surveyed, and as decisive by only 17 firms. It was more&#13;
important to the suburban (15 percent) and exurban (19 percent) groups,&#13;
and understandably more important to firm owning rather than leasing&#13;
their new buildings0 Its importance was zero for across city moves within&#13;
Sao Paulo.&#13;
Provision for the disposal of industrial wastes is a minor&#13;
location factor for all five groups of new plants. The availability of&#13;
public transport for workers to the new plant site was a more Important&#13;
factor, being of major importance for 36 percent overall and decisive for&#13;
four percent, a proportion that rose to 57 percent of the across city&#13;
moves0 Many of the transfer moves will have wanted to retain all or most&#13;

of their pre-move labor force - thus the need for transport. These&#13;
figures stand high by the standards of North America and Western Europe,&#13;
but in most newly industrializing countries public transport is a major&#13;
determinant of effective labor market areas.&#13;
The availability of the communications facilities of telephone&#13;
and telex was important to half of the moves within the inner metro area&#13;
and to 66 percent of the exurban group, making it second only to electric&#13;
power in importance among the utilities. It was a decisive factor for 61&#13;
companies, a surprisingly high number until it is realized how recently a&#13;
modern and reliable telecommunications system has been established in the&#13;
State of Sao Paulo. Against expectations, it was cited by more of the&#13;
firms serving local markets than national or foreign markets0 Outside the&#13;
inner metro area, it was a factor cited frequently by moves into existing&#13;
buildings not requiring extensive modifications) which may reflect&#13;
difficulties in transferring lines.&#13;
(e) Site Factors&#13;
The existence of a suitable plot of land to purchase was much&#13;
less important to births (32 percent) and to the across city moves (28&#13;
percent) than to the firms moving to the suburbs (68 percent), the exurban&#13;
group of movers (84 percent) and the hinterland movers (63 percent). This&#13;
is because of the desire of many firms in the first two groups (births and&#13;
across city movers) to rent rather than purchase the premises. This&#13;
factor was cited by more large plants in all subgroups, and by the capital&#13;
intensive units; but not, surprisingly, by more of the space extensive&#13;
plants in all subgroups. As expected, it was more important as a factor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
to firms intending to own and/or constrcut their new buildings rather than&#13;
purchasing existing premises. The existence of a suitable building to&#13;
purchase or lease was much less important as a location factor for all&#13;
groups. It was not a mirror image of the attraction of an empty plot of&#13;
land, suggesting that for a large minority of firms the location was&#13;
chosen before a specific building was settled upon. Only among births did&#13;
a noticeable minority cite this factor.&#13;
As discovered in previous industrial location studies, space for&#13;
subsequent expansion was a high priority for many companies in the Sao&#13;
Paulo survey, especially among the moves to locations outside the inner&#13;
metro area. This is seen in detail in Table IX. Space for expansion is&#13;
less important for births, perhaps because they anticipate relocating as&#13;
they grow. This view is reinforced by the contrast in response between&#13;
large and small births. The factor is particularly important among large&#13;
new plants in the exurban group (91 percent) and the hinterland group (92&#13;
percent), especially those owning their new buildings (92 percent and 84&#13;
percent). The availability of property to lease scores high as a location&#13;
factor among births, especially small births which are not capital&#13;
intensive or space extensive. It is also an important location factor for&#13;
the smaller across city movers. It is interesting to note how very&#13;
unimportant this factor is for the exurban group, as shown in Table IX.&#13;

The high cost of land is often cited as a reason encouraging&#13;
industrial companies to decentralize and might therefore be expected to&#13;
rate as an important factor in locational choice for a new plant. In&#13;
fact, it was of major importance to only eight percent of firms surveyed,&#13;
a decisive factor for just 17 percent and, surprisingly, of no importance&#13;
to 55 percent. For companies leasing property, the cost of land is of no&#13;
direct importance, a factor pushing the percentage of births citing this&#13;
factor as unimportant up to 60, (Table IX). And for movers across Sao&#13;
Paulo, the finding that 88 percent thought land cost was unimportant may&#13;
in part be explained by the necessity to locate there because of&#13;
industrial linkages, etc., but also in part by the attraction of high cost&#13;
land as an asset to raise loans against and as a speculation in a fast&#13;
growing city. It was, however, a major and decisive location factor for&#13;
53 percent of the suburbanizing group and for 69 percent of the&#13;
exurbanizing group. Outside Sao Paulo, there are no strong contrasts&#13;
except by plant size; but for exurban moves it concerns a higher&#13;
proportion of small rather than large plants, perhaps indicating that land&#13;
cost is pushing the decentralizing smaller company.&#13;
(f) Other Factors&#13;
Not included in the four appendix tables are two factors of&#13;
possible importance in the choice of location for a new plant or company&#13;
in a multiplant company or group of companies. The first factor is the&#13;
ease of access to other plants of the same company, reflecting principally&#13;
intra-company flows of goods and materials but perhaps also the need for&#13;
common management and supervision. This last element is, however,&#13;

reflected more in the second related question on the ease of access to the&#13;
parent company or the central office, following corporate lines of&#13;
control. These two factors are cross tabulated on Table X against a three&#13;
way breakdown of the status of plants in multiplant organizations, and the&#13;
figures clearly confirm the importance of corporate management structures&#13;
for industrial location patterns, now stressed in many studies in MDCs.&#13;
This consideration will become more important as the Brazilian industrial&#13;
economy matures and grows more complex.&#13;
Family and personal reasons as a factor were noted above and&#13;
have long been commented upon in the industrial location literature. The&#13;
same literature has commented on an apparent growing requirement by&#13;
companies in LDCs to consider the residential environment for the manager&#13;
of a new plant in choosing a new site. With growing pollution and&#13;
congestion in metro Sao Paulo and improving living conditions in the&#13;
secondary towns of the state, it was anticipated that this factor might be&#13;
important for a significant minority of new units in multiplant&#13;
companies. This hypothesis is only partly confirmed in Table Ten and the&#13;
appendix tables. It was of some importance to 31 percent of units in&#13;
multiplant companies, a weighted equivalent of 171 plants; but decisive in&#13;
only 11. It was important for relatively more of the units classified as&#13;
a "company in a group," reflecting the extra managerial functions involved&#13;
and so the proportionately higher number of white collar grades in the&#13;
staff of the new unit. From the appendix tables it will be seen that this&#13;
factor is particularly important to larger births and exurban moves and to&#13;
capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 &#13;
Intensive and space extensive births, as well as to the same group of&#13;
movers. Understandably, it rated a low score for the small hinterland&#13;
moves.&#13;
Concern with the quality of local health facilities links to the&#13;
previous factor, as well as to a more general questioning of the local&#13;
environment for the new work force. Hence the higher number of the local&#13;
small city moves quoting health facilities as an important location factor&#13;
(15 percent). Among the exurban moves, this factor was rated important by&#13;
a relatively high number of the larger plants (27 percent), and capital&#13;
intensive plants (30 percent). It was particularly important for firms in&#13;
the clothing and machinery sectors (28 and 30 percent).&#13;
The last two questions are looser in form and reflect a regional&#13;
orientation not entirely appropriate for a metropolitan decentralization&#13;
study. However, some of the secondary towns of the state do have&#13;
particular industrial strengths and traditions and these could act as a&#13;
locational influence; just as the degree of local competition might,&#13;
especially for those firms serving local markets. In fact, the survey&#13;
results show local competition for products to be an unimportant location&#13;
factor for all groups of new plants; only for the hinterland moves does&#13;
the proportion of those rating this factor as important reach double&#13;
figures. The existence of a local tradition in the sector is considerably&#13;
more important, especially for the hinterland moves (20 percent) in the&#13;
traditional labor intensive trades. It was particularly unimportant among&#13;
the suburban moves.&#13;

(g) Single Decisive Location Factors&#13;
At three spatial levels the question was asked: "Among the&#13;
reasons indicated, was any one by itself the decisive factor in the&#13;
selection of this region (municipality, site)?" For the majority of the&#13;
581 firms interviewed, no single factor was decisive: for 59 percent in&#13;
the selection of region, for 59 percent in the selection of municipality,&#13;
and for 55 percent in the selection of site. Where a single reason was&#13;
given, many different factors were cited, as shown in Table XI, which uses&#13;
a four way breakdown of the firms.&#13;
In the selection of region, the most important factor listed as&#13;
decisive was that of family ties, but for only 6.7 percent of the new&#13;
plants. The next six factors in descending order were close contact to&#13;
main customers (5.5 percent), cost of land (4.3 percent), "other" (3.8&#13;
percent), plentiful labor supply (2.9 percent), access to main suppliers&#13;
(2.9 percent), and area tradition in the product (2.6 percent). No other&#13;
factor was decisive for more than two percent of the firms in the choice&#13;
of region.&#13;
In the choice of municipality, the most important decisive&#13;
factor was the cost of land, for 11.7 percent of the new plants. The next&#13;
four factors isolated by more than two percent of the firms were the&#13;
existing ownership of land in the municipality or the donation of a site&#13;
by a private entity (11.5 percent), family ties again (5.5 percent), the&#13;
granting of land or free filling and grading by the municipality (2.6&#13;
percent), and the existence of an industrial district (2.6 percent).&#13;

In the final decision on a site, only five factors were decisive&#13;
for more than two percent of the firms. Thirteen percent cited the&#13;
existence of a suitable lot, while availability of space for future&#13;
expansion was cited by 7.8 percent. The remaining factors were "Other"&#13;
(6.4 percent) and the existence of a suitable building (2.6 percent).&#13;
(h) Differences by Industrial Sector&#13;
The responses to the 38 location factor questions, classified by&#13;
the industrial sectors of the principal products of the mobile transfer&#13;
and branch plants, are given in Annex Table A-7. For many of the factors&#13;
the differences between sectors are not as strong as might be expected,&#13;
thus stressing that in locational choice the product characteristic of the&#13;
company or plant is less important than differences in the process&#13;
technology and in size and corporate organization. Table A-7 does,&#13;
however, reveal some significant contrasts.&#13;
A plentiful supply of labor was an important location factor for&#13;
far more of the clothing (76 percent) and textile (86 percent) firms than&#13;
for firms in chemicals (31 percent) and in electrical equipment and&#13;
mineral products (30 percent). This contrast continues into the other&#13;
questions about aspects of labor supply. The textile sector was more&#13;
concerned (37 percent) with cheap labor than any other sector, and both&#13;
the clothing and textile sectors, along with machinery, electrical, iron&#13;
and steel, and metal working sectors, stressed "with required skills."&#13;
The two education questions were relatively more important for textile&#13;
firms, as for firms in the iron and steel sector. The question, added&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46 &#13;
from the "other" category, on the importance of the mobility of labor&#13;
transferring into the region was understandably more important to the&#13;
agricultural and mineral products sector.&#13;
There are some interesting contrasts in the responses to the two&#13;
main accessibility questionse Being close to main suppliers was much less&#13;
important for firms in plastics and rubber (29 percent), textiles (22&#13;
percent) and clothing (27 percent) than for all firms on average (47&#13;
percent). In all three of these sectors being close to customers was&#13;
important for a larger proportion of firms than being close to&#13;
suppliers. This was also true by a comfortable margin of firms in the&#13;
transport products sector, as well as for firms in the iron and steel and&#13;
mother' sectors. But the reverse was true in the remaining sectors.&#13;
Being close to suppliers rather than customers was rated important by more&#13;
firms in the agricultural and minerals sector, in chemicals, in other&#13;
metal working9 in machinery and in electrical equipment.&#13;
It is difficult to comment on the significance of the government&#13;
Influences by sector because the underlying numbers are small and are very&#13;
much influenced by local conditions. It is interesting that industrial&#13;
districts were important to relatively more of the chemicals (37 percent)&#13;
and the textile firms (27 percent)9 two sectors which are different in so&#13;
many other ways. Prepared land and site infrastructures was also an&#13;
influence to relatively more of the firms in the chemicals sector.&#13;
Among the urban services, there are many strong differences in&#13;
responses across the sectors. Maintenance and technical services were&#13;
cited by relatively few firms in the machinery (18 percent) and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
transport products (13 percent) sectors relative to the overall average&#13;
(29 percent). This was more surprising than the relatively higher&#13;
requirement for consulting and allied services in chemicals (16 percent),&#13;
other metal working (17 percent) and the clothing and leather sector (20&#13;
percent) or than the low number citing this factor among the agriculture&#13;
and mineral products sector (2 percent). The importance of an adequate&#13;
public water supply was stressed relatively much more frequently in the&#13;
textiles sector than in other sectors, and by a relatively low proportion&#13;
of firms in the chemicals sector, which is puzzling until one looks at the&#13;
response to the proximity to springs question. Public water supply was&#13;
played down in the plastics and rubber and other metal working sectors.&#13;
Understandably, the disposal of wastes was a particularly important factor&#13;
in the agricultural and mineral products sector; it is also stressed as a&#13;
key factor in the other metal working sector. Public transport to the&#13;
sites was an important location factor to a high proportion of the two&#13;
labor intensive sectors of textiles and clothing.&#13;
Among the site factors, a suitable plot was important to a much&#13;
smaller proportion (21 percent) of clothing firms than overall (51&#13;
percent), just as space for expansion was played down by other metal&#13;
working firms (46 percent) and up by chemicals firms (85 percent) compared&#13;
with the overall average of 61 percent. Property to lease was&#13;
particularly important in the clothing sector (78 percent compared with 41&#13;
percent overall), perhaps explaining why the cost of land was less&#13;
important (9 percent) in this sector than elsewhere (30 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Among the remaining determinants, noticeably high responses&#13;
occur among textiles plants for the "local tradition in sector" factor and&#13;
among clothing plants for the health facilities factor. Personal and&#13;
family reasons of the owner, important for 23 percent overall, were more&#13;
often cited by firms in the iron and steel sector (42 percent), in the&#13;
textiles sector (28 percent) and clothing firms (31 percent).&#13;
VI. FACTORS ENCOURAGING THE SEARCH FOR A NEW LOCATION&#13;
The reasons why companies choose one new location rather than&#13;
another in the State of Sao Paulo do not differ greatly from those reasous&#13;
given by companies in similar surveys in the United States and the United&#13;
Kingdom. The same is true of the reasons why the companies sought a new&#13;
location for operations in the first place. This section of the paper&#13;
discusses these "push" motives for industrial movement. Since these are&#13;
motives for moving away from a specified geographical origin to establish&#13;
a new unit at a destination, the discussion uses material from the&#13;
transfer and branch plant moves in the survey only, leaving to one side&#13;
the 122 new plants classified as "births". The discussion is based on&#13;
Table XII and on Annex Tables A8 and A9. The thirty "push" factors have&#13;
been divided into six groups: those to do with expansion and growth, with&#13;
access to suppliers and customers, with the availability of labor, with&#13;
the conditions of existing sites and buildings, with the impacts of&#13;
different aspects of public policy, and an "other" category.&#13;

(a) Expansion Factors&#13;
The final column of Table A8 shows quite clearly that a desire&#13;
to expand production of an existing product or products and a lack of&#13;
additional space in existing premises for growth are the dominant reasons&#13;
for searching for a new location for the vast majority of geographically&#13;
mobile companies:  81 percent of those questioned cited ".eeto permit&#13;
increased production of products previously manufactured' and '...because&#13;
the previous premises were fully occupied." This second reason was&#13;
relatively more important to larger new plants, to those expanding outside&#13;
the metropolitan area, to those with low space per worker requirements,&#13;
and to those companies in the engineering and modern sectors of industry.&#13;
The moving companies have also been divided into four groups for&#13;
analysis depending on their origins and destinations: "Across city,"&#13;
'Suburbanizing," "Exurbanizing" and 'Other Moves Outside Sao Paulo."&#13;
These groups have been used in Table XII, where the definition of each&#13;
group is given in the footnoteG The Table shows that the increased&#13;
production factor is held to be nearly equal in importance by both&#13;
transfer moves and branch plant moves In the four groups, but that the&#13;
fully occupied site factor was relatively more important for transfers&#13;
moving within the city and within the suburban municipalities (85 percent)&#13;
and relatively less important for the transfers and branches moving out&#13;
from the city to the suburbs (76 percent)0 These responses are shown&#13;
again in Table XIII but in greater detail. That Table shows that the&#13;
fully occupied site factor was of decisive importance for 70 percent of&#13;
the decentralizing group in particular, even though the proportions&#13;

attributing importance overall to this reason were similar between the&#13;
categories. A similar pattern is shown for the increased production&#13;
factor, although a sizeable 19 percent minority of decentralizing firms&#13;
said that the reason was of "no importance." These are perhaps "forced"&#13;
movers, moving because of expropriation or leases falling due for renewal&#13;
or because of community opposition to their activities at the previous&#13;
locationo&#13;
Two further possible reasons for seeking a new location&#13;
connected with expansion which were put to the companies interviewed were&#13;
"9ooto permit the introduction of a new line of products in the same area&#13;
of activity," and "...to start operations in another area of activity."&#13;
The first was important for a sizeable minority of companies, 44 percent,&#13;
and especially for foreign owned companies, and those serving local&#13;
markets. The second reason was much less cited, important for only 4&#13;
percent overall. Again it was relatively more important for foreign owned&#13;
companies, and then markedly less so for companies moving in the&#13;
hinterland of the state. Responses to the new product line factor are set&#13;
out in detail in Table XIII, showing little variation among the four&#13;
groups of movers.&#13;
(b) Access Factors&#13;
Five questions were asked about the importance of the distance&#13;
of the original unit to customers and suppliers. Only five percent of&#13;
firms cited the importance of the reason "...because the previous unit was&#13;
very far from the markets previously served and/or from new potential&#13;
markets0"  This in turn was more than twice the number attributing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
importance to: "...because the location of the company's markets changed"&#13;
(one percent); "...because the previous unit was very far from current&#13;
and/or potential suppliers of components" (two percent); "...because the&#13;
previous unit was very far from current and/or potential sources of raw&#13;
materials' (two percent); and "...because the previous unit was far from&#13;
current and/or potential suppliers of industrial and business services"&#13;
(one percent).&#13;
The low ranking of these access factors is a function of the&#13;
small variation in access for short distance transfer moves. The&#13;
percentages in Table XII for transfers alone are nearly all lower than for&#13;
transfers and branches together (branch moves were not listed separately&#13;
in the four groups because the numbers were too small). The Table shows&#13;
that the percentage citing the market access factor is noticeably higher&#13;
for the moves outside the metropolitan area than for the moves&#13;
decentralizing from the metro area, which is perhaps a little&#13;
surprising. The appendix table shows market access being cited more often&#13;
by high capital intensive firms, firms in the engineering and modern&#13;
sectors and by firms serving primarily national and foreign markets. All&#13;
of these results are counter intuitive. Phi-statistics are shown for some&#13;
of the categories of moves for the other four access reasons. The&#13;
percentages involved are so small, however, that it is difficult to read&#13;
great meaning into the pattern of the results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
(c) Labor Factors&#13;
Even in a labor surplus economy labor shortages may exist,&#13;
particularly for specific formally learned skills. Also,, over time the&#13;
spatial patterns of relative labor cotzs change with the growth of one&#13;
sector rather than another or with city growth. Both of these factors may&#13;
constitute a reason for movement. Labor supply problems have been cited&#13;
in British and American industrial location surveys as coming within the&#13;
top five reasons for movement.(6)&#13;
The survey results here show clearly that the labor supply&#13;
factor is relatively much less important than in the U.S. and U.K0 as a&#13;
location push factoro Only five percent of firms cited difficulty In&#13;
finding unskilled labor as a push factor of major or decisive&#13;
importance0  The responses to difficulty in recruiting skilled labor&#13;
involved eight percent of the firms, with administrative staff only one&#13;
percent, and female workers only two percent0 The only markedly higher&#13;
figures shown in Table XII are for moves outside the metropolitan area&#13;
(e.g0 the 14 percent for transfer moves within the hinterland prompted to&#13;
move by difficulties in finding skilled labor)0  This might be expected of&#13;
fast growing firms in relatively small labor poolso The divisions in&#13;
Table A8 are all based on relatively small numbers and so are difficult to&#13;
interpret strongly. It is Interesting, however9 that difficulty in&#13;
finding both unskilled and skilled labor Is important to twice as many&#13;
firms with older technology then with modern technology. Foreign owned&#13;
companies worried about skilled workers but, unexpectedly, the capital&#13;
intensive firms did not0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

High labor costs were a key push factor for six percent of&#13;
movers, particularly those with high capital intensity, low space&#13;
intensity, and those in the traditional and intermediate sectors. They&#13;
were a key factor as well for those (Table XII) moving out to the&#13;
hinterland from the inner metro area, showing relative labor costs to be&#13;
an important source of decentralization, if only for a minority of&#13;
firms. Trade union difficulties, a reason cited in both U.K. and U.S.&#13;
studies, were uniformly unimportant. This reflects the low level of&#13;
unionization in Brazilian industry and the circumscribed role allowed&#13;
unions under Brazilian law. Greater freedom has been allowed to trade&#13;
unions since 1979, a fact unreflected, however, in the locational behavior&#13;
of the firms in this survey.&#13;
(d) Building and Site Factors&#13;
One site factor, the full occupation of existing premises, has&#13;
already been mentioned. Very closely related to this is the factor "...to&#13;
permit internal reorganization such as physical rearrangement of&#13;
equipment, introduction of new machinery, etc." For many firms it would&#13;
be difficult to say whether this factor was chicken or egg: did it prompt&#13;
a move, or was it prompted by the possibility or prospect of a move?&#13;
Either way, as shown in Table XIII, it wae seen as a major push factor by&#13;
62 percent of the firms interviewed, and more among those outside the&#13;
metro area (76 percent) or decentralizing from the metro area (76&#13;
percent). It was more important for large than for small plants of a less&#13;
capital intensive nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Two further physical attributes of the existing premises were&#13;
not so important: increasing traffic congestion in the vicinity (14&#13;
percent), and the necessity to rebuild or remodel for reasons of safety&#13;
(10 percent). The second of these reflects in part developing legislation&#13;
in Brazil for health and safety at work. Traffic congestion was an&#13;
important push factor for twice as many suburbanizing moves as for moves&#13;
within the central metropolitan areas, and for nearly three times as many&#13;
decentralizing moves. The importance fell again for the non-metro origin&#13;
and destination moves, as might be expected. Table A8 shows how traffic&#13;
congestion also scored high for both highly capital intensive and highly&#13;
space extensive plants. The unsafe premises factor, expectedly, was&#13;
relatively more important for transfers than for branch plant moves, as&#13;
well as for high capital intensity plants.&#13;
Also important were two cost factors: the present terms on&#13;
which the premises were leased (13 percent, and again higher for transfers&#13;
than branches as expected), and the cost of land (14 percent)0 This&#13;
second cost factor should probably be labelled value of land when it is&#13;
acting as a push factor for transfer moves, encouraging for example 31&#13;
percent of the decentralizing transfers which could finance their moves&#13;
and expansion through profits on the previous site. Table A8 shows land&#13;
costs are a push factor to more of the larger plants, to plants in the&#13;
engineering and modern sectors, and to the more capital intensive and&#13;
space extensive units, all as expected. Table XII shows that it is&#13;
relatively more important to the decentralizing units. This is picked up&#13;
again in Table XIV, showing clearly the importance of land costs as a push&#13;
factor to the "exurbanizing' groupo&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The final two site based push factors are two sides of a coin:&#13;
'0..because of the opportunity to dispose of the previous premises on&#13;
attractive terms' and '...because of eviction, the owner demanded the&#13;
property, etc." Both were relatively unimportant. The opportunity to&#13;
sell was relatively much more important to the firms moving within the&#13;
inner metro area (Table XII) than to the others. Also, the opportunity to&#13;
sell was important for smaller capital intensive plants and plants in the&#13;
traditional and intermediate sectors (Table A8), for reasons which are not&#13;
clear. The eviction reason was important to relatively more of the&#13;
decentralizing groupo&#13;
(e) Government Actions&#13;
Three forms of government action provide a direct incentive for&#13;
industrial movement within and from the Sao Paulo metropolitan areao&#13;
expropriation for public use, pollution controls, and enforcement of&#13;
zoning laws. Other government policies provide indirect pressures but&#13;
these three were all cited by a distinct minority of the surveyed firms,&#13;
the pollution control reason being relatively more important than the&#13;
other twoo&#13;
The pollution control reason was relatively less Important to&#13;
the moves across the metro area, suggesting that it is a direct incentive&#13;
to decentralization, away from the more polluted parts of the urban&#13;
area. As well as being of decisive importance to six percent of firms&#13;
(ten percent of suburbanizing moves and 14 percent of exurbanizing moves),&#13;
this factor was of some, or 'little,' importance to another eight percent&#13;
of the moves (Table XV). This suggests that the pollution control factor&#13;

is creating a supplementary pressure for movement, particularly for&#13;
decentralizing moves, adding to other pressures. When a need for new&#13;
premises arises because of expansion, etc., the pollution control&#13;
encourages a search in the suburbs or out of the metropolitan area that&#13;
might not otherwise have taken place, requirements having been satisfied&#13;
within the central metro area. The factor was of some importance to 30&#13;
percent of the exurban group and 29 percent of the suburban group. (An&#13;
outline of the pollution control policy is provided as Appendix D to this&#13;
chapter.)&#13;
Table XII shows that the expropriation reason was relatively&#13;
much more important to the suburbanizing group of movers than to firms in&#13;
the other three groups. Zoning laws were unimportant to nearly all the&#13;
subgroups of movers, particularly the across city moves, but they did&#13;
constitute a decisive push factor for 11 percent of the exurbanizing group&#13;
(Table XV).&#13;
(f) Other Reasons&#13;
Of the remaining four reasons for movement analyzed, the factor&#13;
"personal reasons of the ownerw was of major or decisive importance to six&#13;
percent of the transfers and branches overall, but to 13 percent of&#13;
transfers outside the metropolitan area. These reasons may include a&#13;
desire to move the factory closer to the owner's residence, or to combine&#13;
with other family holdings.   "Combining scattered units" was suggested as&#13;
a reason for movement by a small majority of firms, as showun in Table&#13;
XIH.  An equally small minority cited difficu'ties -w-ith the supply of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
electricity as a reason for moving. Table XII shows that these firms were&#13;
confined to those moving within the Sao Paulo hinterland.&#13;
The fourth reason in this last group of factors was "...because&#13;
of community opposition to the presence of the company at the previous&#13;
location." This was of major or decisive importance to five percent of&#13;
transfers and branch moves overall, but to higher percentages outside the&#13;
metro area, as shown in Table XII. Table XIV shows that this factor was&#13;
of some importance to one quarter of these moves but to very few of the&#13;
moves across the metro area. Tables XII and A8 also list an "Other"&#13;
category, individual reasons which were more important for branch plant&#13;
moves than for transfers.&#13;
(g) Single Decisive Factors&#13;
All of the transfer and branch plant moves were asked about each&#13;
of the geographical movement push factors discussed above separately.&#13;
They were then asked: "Of the factors mentioned, were any of them the&#13;
sole reason for the move and/or expansion?" The reasons cited by two&#13;
percent or more of the respondents are presented in Table XVI.&#13;
The important fact about the numbers in Table XVI is that they&#13;
are so low. Two factors stand out: increased production and lack of&#13;
space for expansion in the previous premises, cited as sole reason by 23&#13;
percent and 19 percent of the firms. The percentages may be compared with&#13;
the figures of 80 percent and 78 percent of the firms citing these two&#13;
factors earlier as of major or decisive importance. This contrast in the&#13;
two questions comes again with the reason "wanted internal reorgan-&#13;
ization," of major or decisive importance to 62 percent of firms, but the&#13;

hierarchy and the control systems of the firm will be reviewed bv manv&#13;
companies at the time of a move.    In particular, these considerations may&#13;
be important at two points in the overall decision makingf.(7) First_ wihon&#13;
the non-move options are being reviewed (if they are). For example.&#13;
additional production may be obtained by subcontracting or by working&#13;
additional shifts, and second, when the choice is made between a complete&#13;
relocation (a transfer) and the establishment of a branch plant. Again&#13;
this choice may not be explicit, or be "obvious" to the managers&#13;
concerned. The self-evident choice may well depend on whether there is an&#13;
overwhelming push factor such as expropriation or the end of a lease&#13;
rather than a desire for expansion to which the response is optional.&#13;
Then again, a branch plant may be the first step of a staged move, which&#13;

results in complete relocation once the new site and location have been&#13;
found to be satisfactory.&#13;
(h) Push Factors by Industrial Sector&#13;
Table A9 subdivides the responses to the thirty push factor&#13;
questions by eleven industrial groupings within manufacturing industryo&#13;
Interpretation of the response patterns sector by sector is made difficult&#13;
by the different strengths of representation of each sector in the&#13;
different spatial groupings seen in Table XIIo Contrasts between smaller&#13;
percentages are also difficult when they are based on adjusted figures&#13;
from a weighted sample. One or two observations alone can produce the&#13;
contrast. Some of the results are worth highlighting however.&#13;
As we have already seen, the desire to expand and to increase&#13;
production is the leading reason to look for a new site0 The largest&#13;
proportion of firms giving this reason (91 percent) came in the fast&#13;
growing electrical equipment industry. This compares with only 63 percent&#13;
of the 138 firms in the agriculture and mineral products sectors0 Other&#13;
sectors came between these values0 There is a similar wide range in the&#13;
premises-fully-occupied reason, this being markedly less important in the&#13;
agricultural and mineral products and the chemicals sectors than in the&#13;
other sectors0 The third major reason for moving is the desire for&#13;
internal reorganization. This is low (48 percent) in the chemicals sector&#13;
compared with the plastics and rubber (70 percent) and textiles sectors&#13;
(82 percent), perhaps linked to technological changes. The development of&#13;
a new product line was much less important for the textiles sector (22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
percent) than, for example, the machinery (57 percent) or electrical&#13;
equipment (56 percent) sectors.&#13;
Among the access reasons it is noticeable how the transport&#13;
products sector firms scored high relative to other sectors. This&#13;
reflects inter industry transactions with suppliers and forward-to-&#13;
assembly units typical of the vehicles sector in many countries. It is&#13;
complemented by the relative importance of markets and suppliers in the&#13;
iron and steel sector, again a sector often associated with agglomeration&#13;
economies. What is perhaps surprising is that the other engineering and&#13;
metal working sectors did not also reflect a need for close access as a&#13;
reason for movement.&#13;
The labor difficulty reasons were quoted more frequently in the&#13;
two labor intensive sectors of textiles and clothing than elsewhere, as&#13;
might be expected. The need of the textile sector for key skilled workers&#13;
is noteworthy, as well as the apparent difficulty some firms in that&#13;
sector have finding administrative staff. The clothing sector stands out&#13;
for the high labor cost reason and for difficulty in finding female&#13;
workers.&#13;
Among the site factors, it is perhaps surprising that the&#13;
proportion citing "increasing traffic congestion" is highest in the&#13;
agricultural and mineral products sectors, just as it is that the iron and&#13;
steel sector is highest in the high cost lease reason (20 percent). The&#13;
cost of land reason was high for chemicals (26 percent), plastics and&#13;
rubber (24 percent), and other metal working (23 percent) and machinery&#13;
(23 percent), and low for textiles (7 percent) and 'others" (4 percent).&#13;

Pollution controls had a particularly strong impact on three&#13;
sectors: textiles (42 percent), chemicals (29 percent)D and other metal&#13;
working (27 percent). Among the remaining reasons, community opposition&#13;
was relatively strong for the other metal working (15 percent) and iron&#13;
and steel (12 percent); and owner reasons were more important in the&#13;
textile (12 percent), transport products (11 percent) and machinery and&#13;
agricultural and mineral products (10 percent) than elsewhere.&#13;
VIIo CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper has presented a summary of a survey of the factors&#13;
important in the choice of new locations for 581 plants in the&#13;
manufacturing sector of the state of Sao Paulo , Brazil. Both the pull&#13;
factors and the push factors in the geographical mobility of the firms&#13;
have been reviewed. The survey also addresses the issues of the problems&#13;
arising in the transition into the new plant and the build up of&#13;
production, and the experience of the company at the new site in reaching&#13;
the initial planned production levels. These issues will be analyzed in&#13;
later papers. The survey also collected locational information on the&#13;
product and geographical pattern of sales and purchases and on the market&#13;
situation of each company interviewed.&#13;
At the risk of oversimplifying, this paper has stressed three&#13;
things in looking at the pattern of responses to questions about&#13;
locational pull factors; first9 that different types and category of new&#13;
plant have different requirements and priorities, within a common broad&#13;
pattern0 Particularly important distinctions for looking at metropolitan&#13;
industrial decentralization have been those between births and branch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
plants and relocations, and between the metropolitan and the non-&#13;
metropolitan locations. Second, that the typical company will cite a&#13;
group of location factors as having been important in the choice of a new&#13;
site, it being rare for a single factor to completely dominate the&#13;
decision. Third, the pattern of responses obtained is not so very&#13;
different from that expected on the basis of past industrial location&#13;
surveys in North America and Western Europe, with some playing up of the&#13;
role of access to reliable utilities and some playing down of the&#13;
importance of labor related factors.&#13;
More than half of the plants moving from origins within the&#13;
built up metropolitan area to destinations out in the rest of the state,&#13;
rated just eight of the 38 locational pull factors as of major or decisive&#13;
importance. They were "Easy Road Access" (86 percent), "Suitable Plot"&#13;
(84 percent), "Space for Expansion" (82 percent), "Availability and&#13;
Reliability of Electric Power" (79 percent), "Cost of Land" (69 percent),&#13;
Telephone and Telex Facilities" (66 percent), "Proximity to Main&#13;
Customers' (55 percent), and Proximity to Main Suppliers" (51 percent).&#13;
Seven of these eight factors are also the most important to the&#13;
suburbanizing group of plants the exception being the greater importance&#13;
given to the factor "Plentiful Supply of Labor," cited by 57 percent of&#13;
this group. Key distinguishing location factors, with differing levels of&#13;
importance for the different sub-groups of firms, will emerge from a&#13;
subsequent discriminant analysis.&#13;
The variety of firms in the sample also encourages variety in&#13;
response to the question: "Why did you move?" The heterogeneity is not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
only a question of industrial sectors, type of process, size of firm, rate&#13;
of growth, managerial organization and other attributes selected and&#13;
achieved by owners and managers over the years. Rather, there is also a&#13;
crucial distinction in that some have been forced to move: they were&#13;
evicted, community opposition built up, their premises were declared&#13;
unsafe, etc. Firms in the second group could have chosen not to move; but&#13;
in order to expand, to introduce a new product line, reach a new market,&#13;
it became necessary to move. The location decision for the second group&#13;
is a derived decision, whereas for firms in the first group the choice is&#13;
forced upon them. The border line between the two groups is not clear&#13;
cut, but the nature of the push may be an important variable in&#13;
determining the choice of a new location.&#13;
The majority of firms in this sample were clearly in the second&#13;
group of optional movers, the prime motive for moving being expansion of&#13;
production beyond the limits of existing floorspace, allowing internal&#13;
reorganization. Of the three factors offered, approximately three&#13;
quarters of the firms gave this motive as being of major or decisive&#13;
importance. And yet, as Table 16 shows, only 42 percent together gave&#13;
"increased production' and "previous premises fully occupied" as the&#13;
decisive single factors. Thirty-three percent of respondents to that&#13;
question said that there was no sole factor or reason behind the move. In&#13;
other words, a combination of factors is the norm.&#13;
In comparison with British and American studies, difficulties in&#13;
obtaining labor are less of a problem in Sao Paulo (as might be expected)&#13;
and so are not as important as a general factor encouraging movement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
The same studies also suggest that strong government incentives induce&#13;
moves; however, relatively weak inducements offered by the state and the&#13;
local governments in the State of Sao Paulo do not seem strong enough to&#13;
generate movement which would not otherwise have taken place. Otherwise&#13;
the general thrust of the results from this survey on movement push&#13;
factors falls in well with results from other studies.&#13;
One final implication brought out by these results is the&#13;
limited importance of direct government policy actions in encouraging&#13;
movement in Sao Paulo between 1977 and 1979. The expropriation reason was&#13;
cited by hardly any firms except in the suburbanizing group, and the&#13;
zoning reason by hardly any except those in the suburbanizing and&#13;
exurbanizing groups. Only the pollution controls were a significant&#13;
government inspired push factor for a large minority of all groups of&#13;
firms, but Table XVI shows that these controls normally operated in&#13;
conjunction with other push pressures.&#13;
Both the location push factors and the location pull factors&#13;
addressed in this survey may be combined with characteristics of both the&#13;
plants and the companies involved and the locations chosen in alternative&#13;
economic models to isolate more rigorously the key relationsips. These&#13;
models will be the subject of further papers.&#13;

Appendix D:.&#13;
Federal/State/Municipal Legislation on Air and Water Pollution&#13;
Federal Legislation: Following the establishment in 1973 of the Special&#13;
Secretariat of the Environment in the Ministry of Interior, legislation in&#13;
1975 provided the means to enforce pollution controls throughout the&#13;
country. The weapons were to be either the restriction of fiscal&#13;
incentives or the full suspension of production activities. The&#13;
legislation delegated pollution control responsibilities to the states,&#13;
recognizing the competence of both states and municipalities to set&#13;
pollution standards and to apply sanctions, but reserving for the federal&#13;
authorities the right to refuse to close down, on pollution control&#13;
grounds, those activities deemed to be of great importance for the&#13;
development and the national security of the country.l/&#13;
In 1976 the government issued regulations which classified the&#13;
interior waters of the country, setting water quality standards for each&#13;
claese with permissible levels of industrial effluentse Further regulations&#13;
set minimum air quality standards for the four main pollutants:&#13;
particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and photochemical oxides.&#13;
A more direct influence of pollution legislation on the choice of&#13;
new industrial locations came with Resolution No. 14 of 1978. This banned&#13;
the granting of federal incentives to projects in GSP, except for special&#13;
1/ State industries remain largely free of state and municipal controls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

cases involving light industry. Projects in this category may be installed&#13;
only if they are non-polluting, if they depend upon their urban location,&#13;
and if they are proposed by small and medium sized Brazilian owned&#13;
enterprises. This discrimination against GSP in the granting of incentives&#13;
was reinforced in November 1980 by a federal government decision to limit&#13;
payments for technological upgrading to only those companies in the GSP&#13;
area which export at least 50 percent of their output and/or have a low net&#13;
foreign exchange requirement.l/&#13;
Further federal legislation came in July 1980 to permit states and&#13;
municipios to zone land uses on pollution based criteria. In fact, GSP was&#13;
ahead of the federal government in this respect, as will be seen below.&#13;
State Legislation: CETESB was established in the state of Sao Paulo out of&#13;
an existing agency in 1975. In 1976 provision was made in state&#13;
legislation for sanctions against violations of pollution standards, but&#13;
the system of application of the standards was to be more elaborate than&#13;
merely the threat of punishment. CETESB was given the power in 1977 to&#13;
require that any new industrial investment, in old or new buildings, be&#13;
previously sanctioned by two licenses: one before the investment is&#13;
installed and a second before the machinery is brought into use. The&#13;
investing enterprise pays a fee for the license. If the enterprise does&#13;
not comply, then it becomes liable for a fine and eventually for closure.&#13;
1/ Foreign owned or controlled firms, which employ more than half of the&#13;
industrial labor force in GSP, are not permitted to benefit from these&#13;
incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

State legislation in 1976 set out air and water quality&#13;
standardse Water resources in the state were classified according to their&#13;
potential uses, while uses of land affecting protected water could be&#13;
controlled. All industrial discharges fell under requirements for&#13;
treatment and pre-treatmento Air pollution was tackled by the definition&#13;
of 11 "air quality control areas" in the states corresponding to the&#13;
administrative regions. Each area is classified as saturated or not for&#13;
each of the main pollutantso Relocation of high polluting industry out of&#13;
saturated areas is encouraged. Licenses are only given to new investments&#13;
in saturated areas if the resulting increase in pollution is very small.&#13;
Municipal Legislation: The Grande Sao Paulo area has far and away the most&#13;
severe pollution problems in cities within the state as well as among&#13;
metropolitan areas across Brazilo Because of the severity of its problems&#13;
it has become the first area in Brazil to reinforce the federal pollution&#13;
standards and the state investment licensing system with local pollution&#13;
based land use controls0&#13;
Under a 1978 state law the Secretary for Metropolitan Affairs was&#13;
given the responsibility for establishing objectives for industrial&#13;
development in the GSP area and for setting out land use zones for&#13;
industry0 There are five categories of zone from "strictly industrial" to&#13;
'Â§non-industrial0" The definition of the zones takes into account&#13;
environmental factors as well as the availability of infrastructure and the&#13;
spatial relationship of the areas to other land uses close by0 Industries&#13;
are divided into five classes, based on the size of the average plant and&#13;
on likely environmental disturbance as well as on links with the local&#13;
regional economy. The first class, which includes the production of iron,&#13;
asphalt, sugar and cellulose, are high polluters and are prevented from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
opening new plants in all zones in the GSP area. The fifth class may open&#13;
new plants in all zones. Class two is restricted to the first and second&#13;
zones, class three to the first three zones, and class four to four of the&#13;
five zones.&#13;
The 1978 law applies only to new plants or extensions of existing&#13;
plants. It does not force or encourage existing non-confirming activities&#13;
to relocate until re-investment in new equipment is undertaken by the&#13;
company. Under the law, a company seeking a new location or an expansion&#13;
of activities within the GSP area must obtain a license from the Secretary&#13;
for Metropolitan Affairs. (This is in addition to the two licenses&#13;
required from CETESB). The terms of the license set limits on the type and&#13;
extent of polluting activities allowed. These limits are designed to&#13;
ensure conformity with the air and water quality standards.&#13;
The land use zoning controls, operated at the municipal level, have&#13;
been extended from the GSP area to the Paraiba Valley. However, as noted&#13;
above, full authority for these controls was not granted by the federal&#13;
government to state goverments until July 1980. Following this new&#13;
legislation, a zoning system, designating land uses to specify types of&#13;
industry, is now being considered for the remainder of Sao Paulo.&#13;
Municipios are developing local zoning ordinances, helped in some cases by&#13;
the Urban Studies Division of the pollution control agency, CETESB; but&#13;
these ordinances are directed more at local taxation requirements than land&#13;
use control objectives.&#13;

            Location factors in the decentralization of
            industry : a survey of metropolitan Sao Paulo, Brazil
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Given pollution, congestion, and the
            condition of public health within the metropolitan Sao Paulo
            area, the issue of whether public policy should actively
            foster industrial decentralization has become an important
            topic of political debate. This paper reports on the
            preliminary analysis of responses to questions asked in the
            survey about the motives for seeking a new site or building
            and the factors entering into the choice of a new site or
            building. Plants were divided into three movement
            categories: births, or new plants of new companies; branch
            plant moves; and transfer moves, involving closure of an
            existing unit and reopening at a new location. The analysis
            indicates that, from a wide range of possible factors, a
            relatively small number play the dominant role in both
            decisions; but considerable variation is found by location
            of the plant and by the characteristics of the company
            involved. Growth and expansion are the most significant
            locational push factors; strongest location pull factors
            include ease of road access, space for expansion, suitable
            plot, available power supply, and plentiful and appropriate
            labor supply.
