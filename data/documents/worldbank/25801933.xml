                Youth out of school and out of work in Brazil1&#13;
&#13;
In Latin America, one in five youthâ&#128;&#148;totaling more than 18 million individuals aged 15 to 24â&#128;&#148;is neither working&#13;
nor in school (ninis)2. Despite the strong economic performance of the region in recent years â&#128;&#147; with vibrant&#13;
economic growth and a significant reduction in poverty and inequality â&#128;&#147; the proportion of Latin American youth&#13;
who are ninis fell only marginally, and the absolute number of young people in this condition actually increased. The&#13;
ninis phenomenon has a strong equity and gender dimension. Nearly 60 percent of ninis in the region are from a&#13;
poor or vulnerable household in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, and two out of every three ninis&#13;
are women. The higher incidence of ninis among women and disadvantaged households, coupled with the long-&#13;
lasting negative labor-market effects of being a nini, means that the phenomenon can cause intergenerational&#13;
persistence of gender disparities and low incomes, which obstructs social mobility and poverty reduction in the&#13;
region.&#13;
As it is shown by Figure 1, the current situation in Brazil is not different from the average in Latin America, with&#13;
20.4 percent of the population between 15 and 24 years of age, representing 6.9 million young people, not working&#13;
nor studying in 2013. Contrary to what has happened in the region as a whole, the share of ninis in Brazil increased&#13;
constantly between 2008 and 2013 and the number of male ninis increased by almost one million in the last 20 years&#13;
(from 1.5 million in 1992 to 2.4 million in 2013). This is an important distinction, since male ninisâ&#128;&#148;and not female&#13;
ninisâ&#128;&#148;, within a context of high prevalence of criminal activities, appear to be correlated with crime and violence&#13;
(de Hoyos, GutiÃ©rrez and Vargas, 2015). A closer look at the data shows that women account for two thirds of the&#13;
total nini population in Brazil. In Latin America, the single most important factor associated with the probability of&#13;
being a female nini is marriage before age 18, compounded with teenage pregnancy. For instance, in 2013&#13;
approximately 1/3 of female ninis between 15 and 19 years of age were already mothers (PNAD/IBGE, 2013).&#13;

2 In Spanish, the more usual term is nini, whereas in Brazil they are known as nem-nem (short for neither working, nor in education in&#13;
&#13;
the respective languages).&#13;
                                                                                                                                       1&#13;

Figure 2 shows that between ages 15 and 18 the proportion of youth ninis increases substantially, both for men and&#13;
women. In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the most common path to become a nini, particularly for&#13;
men, is through early school dropout into the informal labor market, followed by unemployment. Since youth who&#13;
dropout before finishing upper secondary do not have the skills necessary to secure a formal-sector job, in most&#13;
cases they settle for a temporary and unstable job in the informal sector. Once they lose this job, they never go back&#13;
to school.&#13;

&#13;
Although the existing evidence to reduce dropouts among men in upper secondary is scarce, Brazil can learn from&#13;
the most recent successful socio-emotional interventions in the United States. Evidence in this area suggests that&#13;
combining early warning systems to identify youth at risk of dropping out, followed by socio-emotional&#13;
interventions such as tutoring and counseling would serve to more effectively reduce dropouts among this critically&#13;
demographic group.&#13;
Recent evidence suggests that there is a relatively high labor market turnover, which would make the nini condition&#13;
a relatively transitory one. In Brazil around one third of ninis leave this state within one year with this turnover rate&#13;
being higher among young men and among workers with higher education levels.3 A large range of policy actions&#13;
and programs can help youth leave the nini condition. A range of training programs with varying emphases (e.g.,&#13;
general academic, specific technical, or socio-emotional skills), settings (in training institutes or on the job), and&#13;
duration can help build the human capital of ninis. Public employment services can increase the speed and quality of&#13;
job matches, and they can identify the needs of individual youth and steer them to training, apprenticeships,&#13;
subsidized or market work. Governments can give youth a boost into the formal private job market via wage&#13;
subsidies or help them into independent employment via entrepreneurship programs; in each case, the limited&#13;
subsidy provided by the government is based on the premise that once there, the youths will be or soon become&#13;
productive enough to sustain the employment without subsidy.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In Latin America, one in five
            youth-totaling more than 18 million individuals aged 15 to
            24-is neither working nor in school (ninis). Despite the
            strong economic performance of the region in recent years –
            with vibrant economic growth and a significant reduction in
            poverty and inequality – the proportion of Latin American
            youth who are ninis fell only marginally, and the absolute
            number of young people in this condition actually increased.
            The ninis phenomenon has a strong equity and gender
            dimension. Nearly 60 percent of ninis in the region are from
            a poor or vulnerable household in the bottom 40 percent of
            the income distribution, and two out of every three ninis
            are women. Brazil's current situation is not different
            from the average in Latin America, with 20.4 percent of the
            population between 15 and 24 years of age, representing 6.9
            million young people, not working nor studying in 2013.
            Recent evidence suggests that there is a relatively high
            labor market turnover, which would make the nini condition a
            relatively transitory one. In Brazil around one third of
            ninis leave this state within one year with this turnover
            rate being higher among young men and among workers with
            higher education levels.  A large range of policy actions
            and programs can help youth leave the nini condition. A
            range of training programs with varying emphases, settings,
            and duration can help build the human capital of ninis.
