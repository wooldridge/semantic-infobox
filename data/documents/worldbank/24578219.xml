ï»¿ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities, Criteria for Allocation of Funds, and Expenditures under the&#13;
UFGE Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered&#13;
into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the&#13;
aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the&#13;
Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The main objective of the Trust Fund is to strengthen awareness, knowledge, and capacity for&#13;
gender-informed policy making and programs. The Trust Fund will support activities that&#13;
contribute to better gender-informed policy making at the country level by increasing the&#13;
availability of gender-relevant data and evidence; contribute to global knowledge by road&#13;
testing new evidence; and help raise awareness of and demand for gender equality interventions&#13;
by working in partnership with client governments, civil society, research institutes, academia,&#13;
the private sector, and development partners.&#13;
Activities&#13;
The Trust Fund will finance activities with a strong 'public good' element, as well as those that&#13;
are innovative and push the frontiers of gender equality work. Activities to be financed by the&#13;
Trust Fund will fall under three main priority areas:&#13;
1.      Increasing availability of gender-relevant data and evidence. Activities will&#13;
include addressing data gaps, making existing data more accessible and building&#13;
evidence in frontier areas and those where gender gaps persist.&#13;
II.     Road testing new evidence. Activities will include identifying relevant lessons on&#13;
how development practitioners can effectively translate new evidence into results on&#13;
the ground, such as strengthening and expanding successful approaches.&#13;
Ill.    Leveraging partnerships to help advance gender equality. Under this activity the&#13;
Bank will engage civil society and private sector, especially from developing client&#13;
countries to identify, disseminate and implement innovative gender equality&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
The implementation of the activities to be financed by the Trust Fund is as follows:&#13;
(I) Bank-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(a)   Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing availability of gender-relevant&#13;
data and evidence) II (Road testing new evidence), and III (Leveraging&#13;
partnerships) mentioned above.&#13;
(b)   Program Management, Program Administration and Knowledge Management:&#13;
The PREM Gender and Development Group (PRMGE) will coordinate the day&#13;
to day activities including leveraging global partnerships, aggregate knowledge&#13;
management activities and administering the Trust Fund, working in close&#13;
collaboration with regions and networks.&#13;
(II) Recipient-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
(a)   Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing availability of gender-relevant&#13;
data and evidence), and II (Road testing new evidence).&#13;
B. CRITERIA FOR ALLOCATION OF FUNDS&#13;
The Gender and Development (GAD) Board is responsible for allocation decisions, and&#13;
ensuring that such allocations are aligned with the objectives of the UFGE and the strategy for&#13;
gender mainstreaming in the Bank.&#13;
The GAD Board will make allocation decisions based on the following general criteria:&#13;
*  Alignment with the Bank's strategy for gender mainstreaming.&#13;
*  Alignment with Regional needs and priorities, as laid out in the Regional Gender&#13;
Action Plans.&#13;
*  Alignment with the overall objectives of the UFGE: to strengthen awareness,&#13;
knowledge and capacity for gender-informed policy making.&#13;
*  Extent to which activities have a strong public-good rationale and/or are catalysts for&#13;
innovation and investment in frontier issues and persistent gaps.&#13;
Funds under the UFGE will mainly be allocated through:&#13;
B. 1. Strategic Allocations&#13;
a)     Strategic Activities: Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing&#13;
availability of gender-relevant data and evidence) II (Road testing new&#13;
evidence), and III (Leveraging partnerships) mentioned above.&#13;
b)      Regional Block Grants (for both, Bank and Recipient execution): These will&#13;
cover a three-year period and be considered once every 18 months, depending&#13;
on funding availability. Proposals must be endorsed by the Regional Vice&#13;
President. The GAD Board will review and approve proposals based on the&#13;
criteria above.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿B. 2. Competitive Calls for Proposals&#13;
A portion of the Trust Fund may be used for competitive calls for proposals for Bank executed&#13;
activities. The intent of this mechanism is to incentivize Bank teams to undertake activities in&#13;
areas where the agenda on gender equality needs a push, It might also be used to address areas&#13;
where the implementation of the 2012 WDR is lagging.&#13;
A Technical Review Committee, consisting of World Bank experts, would be convened to&#13;
establish criteria for a call for proposals and to review and rank those that are submitted. The&#13;
GAD Board will endorse the criteria and clear the selection of proposals.&#13;
B. 3. PRMGE Managed Allocation&#13;
The focus under this allocation is priority area III (leveraging partnerships) as described above,&#13;
as well as activities that will include aggregate knowledge management and UFGE's Program&#13;
management and administration, to be carried out by PRMGE.&#13;
C. ELIGIBLE CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;
For Bank-Executed activities the Contributions may be used to finance:&#13;
(a)   consultants' services (individuals and firms);&#13;
(b)   extended term consultants;&#13;
(c)   associated overheads (e.g., telephone, fax, internet connection expenses during&#13;
