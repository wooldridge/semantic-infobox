Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)&#13;
(MTO No. 069015) (DFID reference 202571-101)&#13;
Dear Ms. Cooke:&#13;
1.    We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD"), as trustee (the "Trustee") of the trust fund&#13;
for Global Agriculture and Food Security Program ("GAFSP") (MTO No. 069015) (the&#13;
"Trust Fund") the intention of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,&#13;
acting through its Department for International Development (the "Contributor") to make&#13;
available as a grant the sum of twelve million, five hundred thousand Pounds Sterling&#13;
(E12,500,000) as a contribution to the Trust Fund (the "Contribution") for  the&#13;
Contributor's financial year 2012/13. Other contributors are also expected to contribute&#13;
to the Trust Fund under the provisions specified in the Annex 1 to this administration&#13;
arrangement (this "Arrangement").&#13;
2.    The Contribution shall be administered by the Trustee on behalf of the&#13;
Contributor in accordance with the provisions of this Arrangement and the "Standard&#13;
Provisions Applicable to the Public Sector Window of the Global Agriculture and Food&#13;
Security Program" ("GAFSP Standard Provisions") attached hereto as Annex 1. The&#13;
GAFSP Standard Provisions constitute an integral part of this Arrangement. Capitalized&#13;
provisions used in this Arrangement and not defined herein shall have the meanings&#13;
given to them in the GAFSP Standard Provisions. In the event of any conflict between the&#13;
provisions of this Arrangement, the Framework Document and/or the Governance&#13;
Document, the provisions of this Arrangement shall prevail over the Framework&#13;
Document and the Governance Document, and the Governance Document shall prevail&#13;
over the Framework Document.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-2-&#13;
3.    The Contributor hereby elects to provide the total amount of the Contribution to&#13;
the Public Sector Window.&#13;
4.    The Contributor shall deposit the Contribution into such bank account designated&#13;
by the Bank promptly following countersignature of this Arrangement by the Contributor&#13;
and submission of a payment request by the Trustee.&#13;
5.    When making such deposit, the Contributor shall instruct its corresponding bank&#13;
to include in its payment details information (remittance advice) field of its SWIFT&#13;
payment message, information indicating: the amount paid, that the payment is made by&#13;
the Contributor for MTO No. 069015 (Global Agriculture and Food Security Program),&#13;
and the date of the deposit.&#13;
6.    Promptly following receipt of the Contribution funds and the Trustee's&#13;
determination that all the necessary documentation has been received to correctly identify&#13;
the funds, the Trustee shall convert such funds into United States dollars at the exchange&#13;
rate obtained by the Trustee on the date of the conversion. In all cases, where the&#13;
Contribution proves to be insufficient to complete the GAFSP activities as a result of an&#13;
exchange rate fluctuation, neither the Trustee nor the Contributor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for additional financing.&#13;
7.    The Contributor will not be responsible for the activities of any person or third&#13;
party engaged by the Trustee as a result of this Arrangement, nor will, the Contributor be&#13;
liable for any costs incurred by the Trustee in terminating the engagement of any such&#13;
person, except as a sole and direct result of a failure by DFID to provide the funds&#13;
committed under the Arrangement.&#13;
8.    The offices responsible for coordination of all matters related to the&#13;
implementation of this Arrangement as of the date hereof are set forth below. Either party&#13;
