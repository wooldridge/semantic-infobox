ï»¿INTRODUCTION&#13;
The Nigeria Economic Report (NER) is a regular publication of the World Bank. Each edition&#13;
provides an overview of recent macroeconomic developments and devotes special attention&#13;
to a topic of particular relevance or urgency. In this edition the macroeconomic overview is&#13;
followed by both a detailed analysis of the country's fuel subsidy and an assessment of the current&#13;
state and economic potential of its natural gas sector.&#13;
2015 has been a momentous year for Nigeria. The general elections held in March brought about&#13;
the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to an opposition party, heightening&#13;
expectations for meaningful political change. The new Government is taking power during a very&#13;
challenging time, however, marked by a sharp decline in global oil prices and continuing violence in&#13;
the country's northeast.This creates a difficult context for realizing the new administration's ambitious&#13;
reform agenda for job creation, the power sector, oil and gas, agriculture, and public administration.&#13;
As noted above, this edition of the NER examines two prominent subjects of debate in Nigeria: the&#13;
fuel subsidy and the natural gas sector.The current budgetary crisis has again motivated Nigeria to&#13;
reconsider the fiscal costs of the fuel subsidy, while the acute inadequacy of power generation in&#13;
Nigeria has cast increasing attention on the natural gas sector. Chapter 2 of the report analyzes the&#13;
costs and benefits of Nigeria's fuel subsidy, including their implications for low-income households.&#13;
Fuel subsidy costs are expected to amount to 18 percent of government oil revenues in 2015, and&#13;
this share could increase to more than 30 percent by 2018 even if oil prices remain low.&#13;
There is a general consensus that increasing the supply of power in Nigeria is critical to the future&#13;
development of the country. The success of the current plans to boost generation capacity will&#13;
hinge on the development of the natural gas sector. Nigeria is endowed with substantial natural&#13;
gas reserves, but major reforms will be necessary to attract the investment necessary to harness the&#13;
potential of the natural gas sector to supply the domestic energy market. Chapter 3 of this report&#13;
summarizes the current regulatory situation in the natural gas sector and outlines potential avenues&#13;
for reform.&#13;
This edition of the NER was prepared by a World Bank team led by John Litwack (Lead Economist)&#13;
and Khwima Nthara (Program Leader and Lead Economist). Masami Kojima (Lead Energy Specialist)&#13;
is the primary author of Chapter 3, and also contributed to other sections. Andrew Dabalen (Lead&#13;
Economist), Jariya Hoffman (Senior Economist), Gloria Joseph-Raji (Senior Economist), and Olayinka&#13;
Babalola (Economist-Consultant) also made contributions.&#13;

MACROECONOMIC OVERVIEW&#13;
Summary&#13;
Given the high dependency of Nigeria on oil revenues,the recent sharp decline in oil prices has given&#13;
rise to major challenges in the form of external imbalance, steep falls in government revenues, and&#13;
slower economic growth. In contrast to the period of 2008-2009, Nigeria no longer has a large fiscal&#13;
reserve to buffer government budgets from the revenue shortfalls. As a result, distributions to federal&#13;
and state government budgets declined in nominal terms by 39 percent in the first half of 2015&#13;
relative to the same period of 2014. Federal and state governments have slashed capital spending,&#13;
and a number of states have struggled just to pay salaries to civil servants and service domestic&#13;
debt obligations.The pace of growth in Nigeria has slowed in light of lower foreign inflows from oil&#13;
and thefiscal contraction.The national currency has depreciated by 20 percent between November&#13;
2014 and March, 2015, leading to a significant import contraction that has alleviated some of the&#13;
pressure on the naira. New currency controls on the forex market should bring further significant&#13;
import contraction, although they are also expected to negatively impact trade and GDP growth.&#13;
Other recent policy initiatives include a financial assistance package for State budgets, measures to&#13;
rationalize the management and operation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC),&#13;
fight corruption, and resolve the conflict in the North East of the country.The fuel subsidy, which is&#13;
imposing a large and increasing burden on public finance, has become the focus of renewed policy&#13;
debate.&#13;
For the medium term, Nigeria will need to create the fiscal space needed to provide the public&#13;
services essential for maintaining and accelerating progress in job creation and poverty reduction.&#13;
However, it will likely be unable to rely on oil revenues as in the past. Oil prices are expected to remain&#13;
weaker over the medium term than their recent historical levels. Even if oil prices rebound to those&#13;
levels, the absence of growth in the oil sector implies that oil revenues will most likely continue to&#13;
decline relative to the size of the Nigerian economy, as illustrated in Chapter 2 of this Report. On&#13;
the positive side, the sovereign debt position of Nigeria is still strong, there is potential for boosting&#13;
non-oil revenue generation, and investors stand ready to bring significant resources to the country&#13;
if they receive signals of commitment by the new Government to policy directions and regulations&#13;
consistent with strong private-sector-led growth.&#13;
The Oil Price Shock&#13;
Crude oil prices have declined sharply since June 2014 and are expected to remain significantly&#13;
below their recent historical levels over the medium term. Bonny Light crude prices fell by almost 60&#13;

OIL REVENUES AND THE FUEL SUBSIDY&#13;
Summary&#13;
This Chapter examines the costs and benefits of the fuel subsidy in Nigeria in light of current&#13;
prospects for oil prices and revenue. Overall, the fuel subsidy appears to have very modest benefits&#13;
for everyday Nigerians, particularly given the fact that the administratively set prices for petrol and&#13;
kerosene are no longer enforced in most of Nigeria. The lack of enforcement means that almost all&#13;
benefits are captured by importers and traders; moreover, even if these prices were fully enforced,&#13;
it is estimated that the richest 20 percent of Nigerians would capture most of the benefits. On&#13;
the other hand, the costs of the subsidy are very high and growing with time, as increasing petrol&#13;
demand in Nigeria outpaces growth in oil output or revenues. The US$35 billion cost of the fuel&#13;
subsidy during 2010-2014 was a primary reason why Nigeria was unable to accumulate a fiscal&#13;
reserve in the Excess Crude Account that could have protected the country from the recent oil price&#13;
shock. Fuel subsidy obligations are expected to reach 18 percent of all government oil revenues in&#13;
2015, and, if the current regulated prices are maintained, this is projected to increase to more than&#13;
30 percent by 2018.&#13;
Introduction&#13;
A recent sharp decline in oil prices and revenues has once again motivated Nigeria to&#13;
reconsider its commitment to the fuel subsidy, which compensates importers and traders&#13;
of petrol and kerosene the difference between estimated world market prices and fixed&#13;
pump prices of 87 and 50 naira per liter, respectively. The fuel subsidy has been a continual&#13;
source of controversy in Nigeria. Previous governments have tried to remove it, but popular unrest&#13;
led to its reinstatement. Some Nigerians considered the fuel subsidy to be one of the only tangible&#13;
benefits that they receive from the Government, and have been skeptical that the Government&#13;
would put the resources to better use for them in the event of its removal.&#13;
The fiscal cost of the fuel subsidy is very high, reaching an estimated US$35 billion during&#13;
2010-2014. Moreover, annual costs are increasing over time due to rising fuel demand and the&#13;
depreciation of the naira. In recent years numerous audits and reports have identified widespread&#13;
corruption and fraud in the administration of the fuel subsidy, and official petrol imports have&#13;
substantially exceeded actual consumption. Attempts by the Government to crack down on fraud&#13;
and delay payment of the subsidy have commonly met with severe fuel shortages in the country&#13;
that also impose high economic and welfare costs on Nigerians. This Chapter intends to inform the&#13;
current discussions in Nigeria on the future of the fuel subsidy by seeking to clarify its current costs&#13;

UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL OF&#13;
NIGERIA'S NATURAL GAS SECTOR&#13;
Summary&#13;
Nigeria's natural gas sector has enormous potential to boost the country's power supply, driving&#13;
accelerated growth and diversification. However, attracting the billions of dollars of investment&#13;
necessary to develop the sector will require a well-designed institutional and policy framework&#13;
backed by a credible political commitment.The authorities will need to re-examine a range of critical&#13;
issues, including the impact of obliging many gas producers to supply the bulk of the gas delivered to&#13;
the domestic market at a single low price, continuing uncertainty about future gas prices and other&#13;
critical parameters, the absence of contractual terms to commercialize gas in certain felds, and the&#13;
pseudo-regulatory roles played by some market operators. In this context, realizing the vast potential&#13;
of Nigeria's natural gas sector will demand a bold new strategy that includes the establishment of an&#13;
independent regulator.&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Nigeria's natural gas reserves are the gth largest in the world,' yet the country suffers from chronic&#13;
gas shortages. Most of Nigeria's electricity is generated by natural gas, and gas shortages have&#13;
contributed to an inadequate power supply that slows economic growth and inhibits diversifcation&#13;
(Figure 3.1). In the first nine months of 2015, Nigeria produced 7.8 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural&#13;
gas per day, of which 44 percent was exported and another 43 percent was used for purposes&#13;
other than commercial sale,6 leaving just 13 percent, or about I bcf/day, for the domestic market.&#13;
Moreover, only two-thirds of the natural gas supplied to the domestic market-or 9 percent of total&#13;
gas production-was used for power generation (Figure 3.2).&#13;
Even in the midst of serious disruptions to the gas supply in the first half of 2015, more gas was&#13;
being flared than used to generate electricity.7 Although gas shortages have now subsided, meeting&#13;
5 Nigeria's natural gas reserves are estimated at 180 trillion cubic feet.&#13;
6 These include re-injection for enhanced oil recovery, flaring, and fueling other oil and gas operations.&#13;
7 A large proportion of natural gas is associated gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. Being far more prof-&#13;
itable than gas, oil production is the main commercial interest. If gas prices are lower than costs of processing&#13;
and transporting associated gas, it is more economic to flare (burn) than to commercialize it. While some flaring&#13;
is unavoidable for safety and other technical reasons, it is possible to commercialize production of associated gas&#13;
and eliminate routine flaring, enabling more productive use of the gas.&#13;

            The Nigeria Economic Report (NER) is a
            regular publication of the World Bank. Each edition provides
            an overview of recent macroeconomic developments and devotes
            special attention to a topic of particular relevance or
            urgency. In this edition the macroeconomic overview is
            followed by both a detailed analysis of the country’s fuel
            subsidy and an assessment of the current state and economic
            potential of its natural gas sector. 2015 has been a
            momentous year for Nigeria. The general elections held in
            March brought about the first democratic transition of power
            from a ruling party to an opposition party, heightening
            expectations for meaningful political change. The new
            Government is taking power during a very challenging time,
            however, marked by a sharp decline in global oil prices and
            continuing violence in the country’s northeast. This creates
            a difficult context for realizing the new administration’s
            ambitious reform agenda for job creation, the power sector,
            oil and gas, agriculture, and public administration. Chapter
            two of the report analyzes the costs and benefits of
            Nigeria’s fuel subsidy, including their implications for
            low-income households. Fuel subsidy costs are expected to
            amount to 18 percent of government oil revenues in 2015, and
            this share could increase to more than 30 percent by 2018
            even if oil prices remain low. There is a general consensus
            that increasing the supply of power in Nigeria is critical
            to the future development of the country. The success of the
            current plans to boost generation capacity will hinge on the
            development of the natural gas sector. Nigeria is endowed
            with substantial natural gas reserves, but major reforms
            will be necessary to attract the investment necessary to
            harness the potential of the natural gas sector to supply
            the domestic energy market. Chapter three of this report
            summarizes the current regulatory situation in the natural
            gas sector and outlines potential avenues for reform.
