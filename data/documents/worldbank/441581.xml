        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The wave of infrastructure privatization
            sweeping the world over the past decade or so has given rise
            to a new category of professional - the specialist utility
            regulator. These regulators, charged with administering
            regulatory frameworks that seek to balance the interests of
            consumers and investors in technically complex and
            politically sensitive industries, can have a major impact on
            the performance of privatized firms, on the cost of
            investment capital (and thus on infrastructure tariffs), and
            on the sustainability of reforms. For this reason the
            development of professional, capable utility regulators
            should be a key part of reform efforts. While new regulators
            in any country can expect to face many difficulties, the
            challenges are particularly daunting for regulators in
            developing countries. This Note reviews those challenges and
            presents some of the main strategies for supporting new
            utility regulators in the developing world.
