        <abstracts>
            Early results from the privatization of
            Venezuela's telephone company show that impressive
            gains are possible in a short time. Even without a fully
            defined legislative framework, benefits from new investment
            can be quickly delivered to consumers. In Venezuela's
            case, within two years of sale 850,000 new and replacement
            lines had been installed, representing a one-third increase
            in the installed network. The number of customers increased
            by nearly half a million, and close to 25,000 public
            telephones were installed or replaced. The author reports on
            the sale that delivered these results.
