ï»¿Interpretative Addendum&#13;
For purposes of interpreting Art. 14.1.4 of the 2014 Framework Agreement (and not as a derogation&#13;
from such Article), the "notional approach" referred to therein shall apply in the following manner in&#13;
cases of both Direct and Indirect Management modalities:&#13;
a)  This Trust Fund is a "Multi Donor Trust Fund" or "MDTF," defined as follows in Article 1(v)&#13;
of the 2014 Framework Agreement: "a trust fund that may receive contributions from more&#13;
than one donor, whose funds are pooled under a single set of agreed terms and such funds are&#13;
not earmarked by individual donors for specific categories of expenditures, also known as&#13;
'joint co-financing' by the Commission."  Consequently, the contributions from the&#13;
Commission, as well as from other donors ("Other Contributions"), form an account of&#13;
commingled funds (the "MDTF Pool") within which no one particular donor's contribution&#13;
can be traced.&#13;
b)  In administering the MDTF Pool, the Bank applies terms that are the same for all&#13;
contributions to the MDTF, in addition to terms, derived from the 2014 Framework&#13;
Agreement, that apply solely to the Commission Contribution ("Commission&#13;
Terms"). Examples of Commission Terms include (i) that costs are incurred within a&#13;
specified time period (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(c) and 14.2.1(b)), (ii) that&#13;
costs are verifiable through supporting documents retained for 7-years after the applicable&#13;
End Disbursement Date (2014 Framework Agreement Arts. 14.1.1(e), 14.2.1(d) and 17.4), or&#13;
(iii) that the Trust Fund pay for indirect costs only at levels not exceeding those accepted by&#13;
the Commission pursuant to 2014 Framework Agreement Art. 13.4.&#13;
c)   The notional approach allows the Commission to participate in MDTFs where not all&#13;
expenditures would be eligible for the Commission (see point b immediately above) without&#13;
earmarking its contribution to specific items or on the basis of geographical criteria. It allows&#13;
so by verifying that there is enough expenditure in the MDTF eligible in accordance with the&#13;
Commission Terms to justify the Commission contribution.&#13;
d)  Consequently, if, in carrying out verifications or audits of the Trust Fund under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 17.2, a sampling by a European Union competent body finds&#13;
ineligible expenditures because of non-compliance solely with Commission Terms, no&#13;
refunds need be made by the Bank or any Recipients, nor shall adjustments be made under&#13;
2014 Framework Agreement Art. 15.3.1, nor shall any offsets be applied under 2014&#13;
Framework Agreement Art. 16.5 or otherwise, as long as sufficient Other Contributions to&#13;
cover the amount of such expenditures were made to the MDTF Pool before the End&#13;
Disbursement Date. Such refunds, adjustments or offsets may only be applied (i) if, and to&#13;
the extent, the ineligible expenditures are in excess of Other Contributions and (ii) if the Bank&#13;
does not provide documentation to justify that an amount equal to such ineligible expenditures&#13;
is covered by the Other Contributions.&#13;
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied in conjunction and are consistent with Art. 17 of,&#13;
and Attachment 3 to, the 2014 Framework Agreement, and are also consistent with the terms of Art.&#13;
42.2 of the Rules of Application (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29&#13;
October 2012).&#13;

Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles&#13;
of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;

time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies,&#13;

use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to&#13;
the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;

rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to&#13;

any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;

first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change,&#13;
the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section,&#13;
which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors&#13;
and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as&#13;

Governance&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between&#13;

oversight committee responsible for policy oversight, resource mobilization, and project/grant&#13;
approvals; and (b) technical working groups responsible for the technical and eligibility screening of&#13;
projects/grants. Decisions of the policy oversight committee will be taken in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the Operational Guidelines. The two structures will be supported by a secretariat based&#13;
in Harare and project support teams. The effectiveness of the governance structure would be assessed&#13;
after 6-12 months of the Trust Fund operation. In its role as ZIMREF administrator, the Bank would&#13;
be responsible for, among others: overall management of the Trust Fund, technical oversight and&#13;
quality control for Trust Fund funded projects in accordance with Bank policies and procedures; and&#13;
establishment and management of the secretariat.&#13;
