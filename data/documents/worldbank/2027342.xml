Foreworld&#13;
Eradicating world poverty is the greatest challenge of our age, and the greatest weapon we have&#13;
to fight poverty is knowledge. Knowledge of policies that work to increase economic growth, of&#13;
how to protect people from disease and protect the environment from degradation, to train&#13;
young minds and equip them for productive work, and knowledge of where we stand now and how&#13;
far we have to go to achieve our goal of a world free from poverty. The World Development&#13;
Indicators gives us access to this last kind of knowledge to helps us assess our past efforts and&#13;
measure the challenge ahead.&#13;
However much the facts and figures tell us about the condition of the world, it is too easy to think&#13;
that a wall separates the rich world and the poor world. Belief in that separation allowed us to&#13;
view as normal a world where fewer than 15 percent of us-in rich countries-dominate the&#13;
world's wealth and take 80 percent of its dollar income. And for too long it has allowed us to view&#13;
as normal a world where a woman dies in childbirth every minute, and where violence, disenfran-&#13;
chisement, and inequality are seen as problems of poor, weak countries and not our own.&#13;
In September 2000, during the Millennium Summit held at the United Nations, more than 140&#13;
world leaders agreed to launch a campaign to attack poverty on a number of fronts. Together, we&#13;
agreed to support the Millennium Declaration-to reduce poverty and hunger, disease and early&#13;
death, inequality and inequity-and to work together in partnership to make this happen by&#13;
2015.&#13;
A year later the shattering events of September 11 toppled the imaginary wall that divided the&#13;
rich world from the poor world and made it clear that there are not two worlds. The process of&#13;
globalization and growing interdependence has been at work for thousands of years and today&#13;
we are linked by communication, trade, investment, travel and migration, by environmental&#13;
degradation, crime, disease, financial crisis, and terror.&#13;
It is time to recognize that in this unified world poverty is our collective enemy. We must fight&#13;
it because it is morally repugnant, and because its existence is like a cancer-weakening the&#13;
whole of the body not just the parts directly affected.&#13;
We have made important progress in the past and we will make progress in the futule.&#13;
Consider these facts:&#13;
* Over the past 40 years life expectancy at birth in developing countries has increased by&#13;
20 years-about as much as was achieved in all of human history before the middle of&#13;
the twentieth century.&#13;
* Over the past 30 years adult illiteracy in the developing world has been cut nearly in half,&#13;
from 47 percent to 25 percent.&#13;
* Over the past 20 years the number of people living on less than $1 a day has fallen by&#13;
200 million, after rising steadily for 200 years.&#13;
* Over the past 10 years average incomes in developing countries have risen by 20 percent.&#13;
These advances have come not by chance. They have come by action of developing countries&#13;
themselves in partnership with the richer world and with the international institutions, with civil&#13;
society, and the private sector. Now, it is more important than ever to continue that partnership,&#13;
based on shared respect, shared interests, shared experience, and to act on our knowledge to&#13;
create a better world for all.&#13;

Preface&#13;
This is the 25'h edition of the World Development Indicators, the 6th in its new format. We&#13;
offer it now as we did 25 years ago, in the belief that reliable quantitative evidence is&#13;
essential for understanding economic and social development-evidence to set policies,&#13;
monitor progress, and evaluate results.&#13;
The World Development Indicators begins with a report on the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals, which set specific, measurable targets for development in the early 215' century.&#13;
These goals, agreed to by all member states of the United Nations, represent an enormous&#13;
challenge to the international community to work together to ensure that all the people of&#13;
the world will share the benefits of social, economic, and technical progress. They focus our  vii&#13;
efforts on improving people's lives: reducing poverty, educating children, combating illness&#13;
and disease. To measure progress and ensure that everyone benefits, we must rigorously&#13;
measure results. And for that we need good statistics.&#13;
Most of the statistics in the World Development Indicators are the product of national&#13;
statistical agencies. In poor countries these agencies are often underfunded and their  C-&#13;
0&#13;
work underused. They need training, equipment, and a clear mandate from their govern-  C&#13;
ments to produce better, more reliable, more timely statistics. But the work does not  o&#13;
stop there, for the international community also plays a role, by establishing standards,&#13;
sharing knowledge, and coordinating the collection and dissemination of international&#13;
statistics.&#13;
The World Bank supports national and international efforts to improve statistics. We are&#13;
working closely with our development partners through the Partnership in Statistics for the&#13;
21s' Century-PARIS21. The goals are to raise awareness of the need for and value of good&#13;
statistics and to strengthen international coordination and governance. We have establishied&#13;
a trust fund to support statistical capacity-building in countries preparing poverty reduction&#13;
strategies, drawing on the generous support of several donors. We are working through the&#13;
International Comparison Programme to improve the measurement of living standards around&#13;
the world. And we are participating in the International Monetary Fund's General Data Dis-&#13;
semination System initiative to help interested countries document their current statistical&#13;
practices and develop plans to improve them.&#13;
As users of the full array of development statistics we all benefit from the work of&#13;
national data providers. And we all benefit when the international community is better&#13;
informed of the challenges and successes of development. That is why we report on the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals and why we invest in better statistics and disseminate&#13;
them widely. But in the end, it is the citizens of developing countries who will benefit&#13;
most when their governments, working in partnership with the World Bank and other&#13;
development agencies, make better decisions based on good evidence.&#13;
Through the World Development Indicators we will continue to bring you the latest avail-&#13;
able information in the most useful and timely ways. We encourage you to send us your&#13;
comments and suggestions, so that by working together we can improve the quality of the&#13;
data we publish and our understanding of the world they describe.&#13;

Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many people&#13;
and organizations. The indicators presented in the World Development Indicators are the fruit of&#13;
decades of work at many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and household&#13;
surveys to the committees and working parties of the national and international statistical agen-&#13;
cies that develop the nomenclature, classifications, and standards fundamental to an inter-&#13;
national statistical system. Nongovernmental organizations and the private sector have also&#13;
made important contributions, both in gathering primary data and in organizing and publishing&#13;
their results. And academic researchers have played a crucial role in developing statistical meth-&#13;
xii                                             ods and carrying on a continuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statistical&#13;
indicators. All these contributors have a strong belief that available, accurate data will improve&#13;

At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 the states of the United Nations reaffirmed their&#13;
commitment to working toward a world in which sustaining development and eliminating poverty&#13;
would have the highest priority. The Millennium Development Goals grew out of the agreements&#13;
and resolutions of world conferences organized by the United Nations in the past decade. The&#13;
goals have been commonly accepted as a framework for measuring development progress.&#13;
The goals focus the efforts of the world community on achieving significant, measurable&#13;
improvements in people's lives. They establish yardsticks for measuring results, notjust for develop-&#13;
ing countries but for rich countries that help to fund development programs and for the&#13;
multilateral institutions that help countries implement them. The first seven goals are mutually&#13;
reinforcing and are directed at reducing poverty in all its forms. The last goal-global partnership&#13;
for development-is about the means to achieve the first seven. Many of the poorest countries will&#13;
need additional assistance and must look to the rich countries to provide it. Countries that are&#13;
poor and heavily indebted will need further help in reducing their debt burdens. And all countries&#13;
will benefit if trade barriers are lowered, allowing a freer exchange of goods and services.&#13;
For the poorest countries many of the goals seem far out of reach. Even in better-off&#13;
countries there may be regions or groups that lag behind. So countries need to set their own goals&#13;
and work to ensure that poor people are included in the benefits of development.&#13;

Are we reaching the goals?&#13;
The eight Millennium Development Goals comprise 18 targets and 48 indicators. Where possible,&#13;
the targets are given as quantified, time-bound values for specific indicators. Data for the&#13;
indicators come from official statistics and surveys conducted by countries and international agen-&#13;
cies. Most of the data are included in this volume, but. missing data and the lack of reliable&#13;
statistics limit the ability to monitor progress.&#13;
How many countries are likely to reach the Millennium Development Goals? Much depends&#13;
on whether the progress in the past decade can be sustained-or accelerated in countries falling&#13;
behind. The charts show the prospects for low- and middle-income countries of r eaching six of&#13;
the targets of the Millennium Development Goals.&#13;
Prospects for each country have been assessed based on their its of progress over the past                                                       5&#13;
decade and, in some cases, on its level of attainment. For two indicators lacking time-series data-&#13;
maternal mortality and HIV prevalence-prospects have been assessed based on level alone. The&#13;
assessments were made uising data available inJanuary 2002 and may be revised in the future.&#13;
These assessments are based on past performance and existing data. They are not a finial ver-&#13;
dict, but they are a warning. Too many countries are falling short of the goals or lack the data to                                                     &lt;&#13;

The labor force estimates in the table were&#13;
calculated by World Bank staff by applying eco-&#13;
nomic activity rates from the ILO database to&#13;
World Bank population estimates to create a&#13;
series consistent with these population esti-&#13;
mates. This procedure sometimes results in&#13;
estimates of labor force size that differ slightly&#13;
from those in the ILO's Yearbook of Labour Sta-&#13;
tistics. The population ages 15-64 is often used&#13;
to provide a rough estimate of the potential la-&#13;
bor force. But in many developing countries chil-&#13;
dren under 15 work full or part time. And in some&#13;
high-income countries many workers postpone&#13;
retirement past age 65. As a result, labor force&#13;
participation rates calculated in this way may&#13;
systematically over- or underestimate actual&#13;
rates.&#13;
In general, estimates of women in the labor&#13;
force are lower than those of men and are not&#13;
comparable internationally, reflecting the fact&#13;
that for women, demographic, social, legal, and&#13;
cultural trends and norms determine whether&#13;
their activities are regarded as economic. In&#13;
many countries large numbers of women work&#13;
on farms or in other family enterprises without&#13;
pay, while others work in or near their homes,&#13;

Because the underlying household surveys&#13;
differ in method and in the type of data col-&#13;
lected, the distribution indicators are not strictly&#13;
comparable across countries. These problems&#13;
are diminishing as survey methods improve and&#13;
become more standardized, but achieving strict&#13;
comparability is still impossible (see About the&#13;
data for table 2.6).&#13;
Two sources of noncomparability should be&#13;
noted. First, the surveys can differ in many re-&#13;
spects, including whether they use income or&#13;
consumption expenditLire as the living standard&#13;
indicator. The distribution of income is typically&#13;
more unequal than the distribution of consump-&#13;
tion. In addition, the definitions of income used&#13;
usually differ among surveys. Consumption is&#13;
usually a much better welfare indicator, par-&#13;
ticularly in developing countries. Second, house-&#13;
holds differ in size (number of members) and&#13;
in the extent of income sharing among mem-&#13;
bers. And individuals differ in age and consump-&#13;
tion needs. Differences among countries in&#13;
these respects may bias comparisons of dis-&#13;
tribution.&#13;
World Bank staff have made an effort to en-&#13;
sure that the data are as comparable as pos-&#13;
sible. Whenever possible, consumption has&#13;
been used rather than income. The income dis-&#13;

surveys or in official data. Underreporting also&#13;
occurs because data exclude children engaged&#13;
in agricultural or household activities with their&#13;
families. Most child workers are in Asia. But the&#13;
share of children working is highest in Africa,&#13;
where, on average, one in three children ages&#13;
10-14 is engaged in some form of economic&#13;
activity, mostly in agriculture (Fallon and&#13;
Tzannatos 1998). Available statistics suggest&#13;
that more boys than girls work. But the number&#13;
of girls working is often underestimated because&#13;
surveys exclude those working as unregistered&#13;
domestic help or doing full-time household work&#13;
to enable their parents to work outside the home.&#13;

Out-of-pocket payments are generally regressive because they have the potential not only to Impoverish people but&#13;
also to deter the poor from obtaining care. Exempting the poor from user fees at public facilities, or Imposing a&#13;
sliding scale, based on socloeconomic characteristics, are attempts to reduce the risks assoclated with out-of-&#13;
pocket payments. However, such schemes require relatively high administrative costs to distinguish users, and may&#13;
end up affecting only a small amount of total risk-related payments.&#13;

UNESCO measures cohort survival to grade&#13;
5 because research suggests that five to six&#13;
years of schooling is a critical threshold for the&#13;
achievement of sustainable basic literacy and&#13;
numeracy skills. However, it should be noted&#13;
that the cohort survival rate does not guarantee&#13;
these learning outcomes, and only indirectly re-&#13;
flects the quality of schooling. Measuring actual&#13;
learning outcomes requires setting curriculum&#13;
standards and measuring students' learning&#13;
progress against those standards through stan-&#13;
dardized assessments, or tests.&#13;
The primary completion rate is being used in-&#13;
creasingly by the World Bank as a core indicator&#13;
of education system performance. Because it&#13;
measures both education system coverage and&#13;
student attainment, the primary completion rate&#13;
is a more accurate indicator of human capital&#13;
formation and school system quality and effi-&#13;
ciency than are either gross or net enrollment&#13;

in the formal education system. The youth    scale for each literacy area was devised so that across&#13;
illiteracy rate reported in the table measures the  OECD countries the average score Is 500 points.&#13;
accumulated outcomes of primary education&#13;
over the previous 10 years or so by indicating&#13;
the proportion of people who have passed&#13;
through the primary education system (or never&#13;
entered it) without acquiring basic literacy and&#13;
numeracy skills. Reasons for this may include&#13;
difficulties in attending school or dropping out&#13;
before reaching grade 5 (see About the data for&#13;
table 2.13) and thereby failing to achieve basic&#13;
learning competencies.&#13;
The indicator expected years of schooling is&#13;
an estimate of the total years of schooling that&#13;
an average child at the age of school entry&#13;
will receive, including years spent on repetition,&#13;
given the current patterns of enrollment across&#13;
cycles of education. It may also be interpreted&#13;
as an indicator of the total education resources,&#13;
measured in school years, that a child will ac-&#13;
quire over his or her "lifetime" in school-or as&#13;
an indicator of an education system's overall&#13;
level of development.&#13;
Because the calculation of this indicator&#13;
assumes that the probability of a child's being&#13;
enrolled in school at any future age is equal to&#13;

unintended pregnancy, shown in the table as&#13;
the percentage of married women of reproduc-&#13;
tive age who do not want to become pregnant&#13;
but are not using contraception (Bulatao 1998).&#13;
Information on this indicator is collected through&#13;
surveys and excludes women not exposed to the&#13;
risk of pregnancy because of postpartum ano-&#13;
vulation, menopause, or infertility. Common&#13;
reasons for not using contraception are lack&#13;
of knowledge about contraceptive methods and&#13;
concerns about their possible health side-&#13;
effects.&#13;
Contraceptive prevalence reflects all&#13;
methods-ineffective traditional methods as well&#13;
as highly effective modern methods.&#13;
Contraceptive prevalence rates are obtained&#13;
mainly from Demographic and Health Surveys&#13;
and contraceptive prevalence surveys (see&#13;
Primary data documentation for the most recent&#13;
survey year). Unmarried women are often&#13;
excluded from such surveys, which may bias the&#13;
estimates.&#13;
The share of births attended by skilled health&#13;
staff is an indicator of a health system's ability&#13;
to provide adequate care for pregnant women.&#13;
Good antenatal and postnatal care improves&#13;
maternal health and reduces maternal and infant&#13;
mortality. But data may not reflect such&#13;
improvements because health information&#13;

Tuberculosis is the main cause of death from  children under five by as much as 30 percent.&#13;
a single infectious agent among adults in&#13;
developing countries. In high-income countries&#13;
tuberculosis has reemerged largely as a result&#13;
of cases among immigrants. The estimates of&#13;
tuberculosis incidence in the table are based&#13;
on a new approach in which reported cases are&#13;
adjusted using the ratio of case notifications to&#13;
the estimated share of cases detected by panels&#13;
of 80 epidemiologists convened by the WHO.&#13;
Adult HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of&#13;
HIV infection in each country's population. Low&#13;
national prevalence rates, however, can be very&#13;
misleading. They often disguise serous epidem-&#13;
ics that are initially concentrated in certain lo-&#13;
calities or among specific population groups and&#13;
that threaten to spill over into the wider popula-&#13;
tion. In many parts of the developing world the&#13;
majority of new infections occur in young adults,&#13;
with young women especially vulnerable. About&#13;
one-third of those currently living with HIV/AIDS&#13;
are in the age group 15-24. The estimates of&#13;
HIV prevalence are based on extrapolations from&#13;
data collected through surveys and surveillance&#13;
of small, nonrepresentative groups.&#13;

the effect of gender discrimination better than&#13;
does infant mortality, as malnutrition and&#13;

Poverty is overwhelmingly rural, with some 70 percent of the poorest people in developing coun-&#13;
tries living in rural areas. Although the number and proportion of poor people in cities are&#13;
expected to grow rapidly in the next decades, the majority of the poor will continue to live in the&#13;
counltryside. So reducing poverty and ending hunger require more attentioni to the rural&#13;
economy and to rural development.&#13;
But there's a problem: most countries-in their development strategies and in their&#13;
allocations of resources-favor cities. Rural people, especially women and ethnic minorities, have&#13;
little political clout, so they cannot influence public policy to attract more public investment to&#13;
rural areas. Reducing rural poverty requires dealing with the entire rural space-with all of rural&#13;
society and with both farm and nonfarm aspects of the economy.&#13;
What will contribute most to faster growth in rural economies and to more poverty&#13;
reduction? Three things: fostering broad-based rural growth, improving social well-being (in part&#13;
by managing risk and reducing vulnerability), and sustaining natural resources. Each country's&#13;
priorities will depend on its level of development-and its success on a policy and institutional&#13;
environment conducive to rural development.&#13;

are generally excluded. But millet and sorghum,&#13;
which are grown as feed for livestock and poultry&#13;
in Europe and North America, are used as food&#13;
in Africa, Asia, and countries of the former Soviet&#13;
Union. So some cereal crops are excluded from&#13;
the data for some countries and included&#13;
elsewhere, depending on their use.&#13;
Agricultural productivity is measured by value&#13;
added per unit of input. (For further discussion&#13;
of the calculation of value added in national&#13;
accounts see About the data for tables 4.1&#13;
and 4.2.) Agricultural value added includes&#13;
that from forestry and fishing. Thus&#13;
interpretations of land productivity should be&#13;
made with caution. To smooth annual&#13;
fluctuations in agricultural activity, the&#13;
indicators in the table have been averaged&#13;
over three years.&#13;

In their study Hettige, Mani, and Wheeler&#13;
(1998) used plant- and sector-level information&#13;
on emissions and employment from 13 national&#13;
environmental protection agencies and sector-&#13;
level information on output and employment from&#13;
the United Nations Industrial Development&#13;
Organization (UNIDO). Their econometric analysis&#13;
found that the ratio of BOD to employment in&#13;
each industrial sector is about the same across&#13;
countries. This finding allowed the authors to&#13;
estimate BOD loads across countries and over&#13;
time. The estimated BOD intensities per unit of&#13;
employment were multiplied by sectoral&#13;
employment numbers from UNIDO's industry&#13;
database for 1980-98. The sectoral emissions&#13;
estimates were then totaled to get daily&#13;
emissions of organic water pollutants in&#13;
kilograms per day for each country and year. The&#13;
data in the table were derived by updating these&#13;
estimates through 1999.&#13;

Commercial energy use refers to the use of&#13;
domestic primary energy before transformation&#13;
to other end-use fuels (such as electricity and&#13;
refined petroleum products). It includes energy&#13;
from combustible renewables and waste, which&#13;
comprises solid biomnass and animal products,&#13;
gas and liquid from biomass, industrial waste,&#13;
and municipal waste. Biomass is defined as any&#13;
plant matter used directly as fuel or converted&#13;
into fuel, heat, or electricity. (The data series&#13;
published in World Development Indicators 1998&#13;
and earlier editions did not include energy from&#13;
combustible renewables and waste.) All forms&#13;
of commercial energy-primary energy and pri-&#13;
mary electricity-are converted into oil equiva-&#13;
lents. To convert nuclear electricity into oil&#13;
equivalents, a notional thermal efficiency of 33&#13;
percent is assumed; for hydroelectric power, 100&#13;
percent efficiency is assumed.&#13;

based on the Cement Manufacturing Data Set  Source: Table 3.8&#13;
maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Emis-&#13;
sions of CO2 are often calculated and reported&#13;
in terms of their content of elemental carbon.&#13;
For this table, these values were converted to&#13;
the actual mass of CO2 by multiplying the car-&#13;
bon mass by 3.664 (the ratio of the mass of&#13;
carbon to that of CO2).&#13;
Although the estimates of global CO2&#13;
emissions are probably within 10 percent of&#13;
actual emissions (as calculated from global&#13;
average fuel chemistry and use), country&#13;
estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends&#13;
estimated from a consistent time series tend to&#13;
be more accurate than individual values. Each&#13;
year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time&#13;
series from 1950 to the present, incorporating&#13;
its most recent findings and the latest&#13;
corrections to its database. Estimates do not&#13;
include fuels supplied to ships and aircraft&#13;
engaged in international transport because of&#13;
the difficulty of apportioning these fuels among&#13;
the countries benefiting from that transport.&#13;

sent to national organizations. The IRF uses a&#13;
hierarchy of sources to gather as much informa-&#13;
tion as possible. The primary sources are na-&#13;
tional road associations. Where such an asso-&#13;
ciation lacks data or does not respond, other&#13;
agencies are contacted, including road director-&#13;
ates, ministries of transport or public works, and&#13;
central statistical offices. As a result, the com-&#13;
piled data are of uneven quality. The coverage&#13;
of each indicator may differ across countries&#13;
because of differences in definitions. Compara-&#13;
bility also is limitecd when time-series data are&#13;
reported. Moreover, the data do not capture the&#13;
quality or age of vehicles or the condition or&#13;
width of roads. Thus comparisons over time&#13;
and between countries should be made with&#13;
caution.&#13;
The data on fuel prices are compiled by the&#13;
German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ)&#13;
from its global network of regional offices and&#13;
representatives as well as other sources, in-&#13;
cluding the Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil&#13;

multiple exchange rates, the market, parallel,&#13;

Without economic growth there can be no long-termn poverty reduction. Economies that have&#13;
achieved sustained growth-by making markets work better for poor people and buildinig up their&#13;
assets-have also succeeded in significantly reducing poverty. Economies that have not grown&#13;
have experienced stagnant or increasing poverty rates. Thus the keen interest in economic growth&#13;
and its predominance among the objectives of economic policy.&#13;
Experience between 1990 and 1999 illustrates the general rule. Over that decade the number&#13;
of people living in developing countries on less than $1 a day fell from 1.3 billion to 1.2 billion,&#13;
and the proportion of people living in extreme poverty-the poverty rate-fell from 29 percent to&#13;
23 percent. Most of these gains were made in the two fastest growing regions, East Asia and Pacific&#13;
and South Asia. In Europe and Central Asia, which experienced painful economic contraction&#13;
over much of the period, both the number and the proportion of people living on less than $1 a&#13;
day increased. In Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa the poverty rate&#13;
declined slightly, but not fast enough to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty.&#13;
And in Latin America and the Caribbean, where average growth has been slow, poverty reduction&#13;
has also slowed.&#13;

The savings and Investment gap&#13;
Savings minus investment as share of GDP, average 1996-2000&#13;
Investment is needed for growth,&#13;
but many countries cannot save&#13;
enough from their own output to   (  15&#13;
finance it. As a result, they must&#13;
tap into foreign savings provided by    10&#13;
lenders or investors. To repay them,      5&#13;
the economy must continue to grow.&#13;

in circulation, titles of ownership, and securi-&#13;
ties are excluded, but monetary gold is included.&#13;
Trade data are collected on the basis of a&#13;
country's customs area, which in most cases is&#13;
the same as its geographic area. Goods pro-&#13;
vided as part of foreign aid are included, but&#13;
goods destined for extraterritorial agencies (such&#13;
as embassies) are not.&#13;
Collecting and tabulating trade statistics is&#13;
difficult. Some developing countries lack the&#13;
capacity to report timely data; this is a problem&#13;
especially for countries that are landlocked and&#13;
where territorial boundaries are porous. As a&#13;
result, it is necessary to estimate their trade&#13;
from the data reported by their partners. Other&#13;
countries that belong to common customs&#13;
unions may need to collect their data by direct&#13;
inquiry from companies. (For further discussion&#13;
of the use of partner country reports see About&#13;
the data for table 6.2.) In some cases economic&#13;
or political concerns may lead national authori-&#13;
ties to suppress or misrepresent data on cer-&#13;
tain trade flows, such as oil, military equipment,&#13;
or the exports of a dominant producer. In other&#13;
cases reported trade data may be distorted by&#13;
deliberate under- or overinvoicing to effect capi-&#13;
tal transfers or avoid taxes. And in some regions&#13;
smuggling and black market trading result in un-&#13;
reported trade flows.&#13;
By international agreement, customs data are&#13;
reported to the United Nations Statistics Divi-&#13;
sion, which maintains the Commodity Trade&#13;
(COMTRADE) database. The United Nations Con-&#13;
ference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)&#13;
compiles a variety of international trade statis-&#13;
tics, including price and volume indexes, based&#13;
on the COMTRADE data. The IMF and the World&#13;

The key&#13;
to improving the&#13;
investment climate can&#13;
be simply stated:&#13;
improving the connection&#13;
between sowing&#13;
and reaping.&#13;

People rise from poverty when countries act on two pillars of development: building a good invest-&#13;
ment climate in which private entrepreneurs will invest, generate jobs, and produce efficiently, and&#13;
empowering poor people and investing in them so that they can participate in economic growth.&#13;
What's a good investment climate? Start with sound macroeconomic management and trade&#13;
and investment policies that promote openness and raise productivity and growth. Add the&#13;
elements of good governance, such as regulation of industry, promotion of competition, and pre-&#13;
vention of corruption. Then set all that on a foundation of basic infrastructure and effective basic&#13;
services, such as health and education.&#13;
The case for creating a good investment climate is simple: an economy needs a predictable&#13;
environment for people, ideas, and money to work together productively and efficiently. The role of&#13;
government is to provide ample room for entrepreneurs to invest in agriculture, industry, and&#13;
services. That allows private firms-small ancl large, domestic ancl foreign-operating in competitive&#13;
markets to be the engine of growth and job creation, providing opportunities to escape poverty.&#13;
Countries should focus first on improving the investment climate for domestic&#13;
entrepren-eurs. An improved climate will also attract foreign investors. In today's globalizing&#13;
world, countries with a good investment climate get more foreign investment-an important con-&#13;
duit for new technology, management experience, and access to markets-and enjoy faster growth&#13;
and more poverty r eduction.&#13;

tries, most notably members of the Organisation&#13;
for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
(OECD), the concepts and definitions of the 1993&#13;
System of National Accounts (SNA) are used.&#13;
Since IFC data conform to the concepts and&#13;
definitions of the 1968 SNA, the data are not&#13;
strictly comparable. While the IFC data on pri-&#13;
vate investment represent only the capital ex-&#13;
penditure decisions of the private sector, in the&#13;
1993 SNA the tern fixed capital formation by&#13;
households and corporations includes capital&#13;
expenditures by both private and public corpo-&#13;
rations. Countries reporting on this basis are&#13;
footnoted in the table. (For further discussion&#13;
on measuring gross capital formation see About&#13;

What is globalization? In broad terms it reflects the growing links between people, communities, and&#13;
economies around the world. These links are complex-the result of lower communications and&#13;
transport costs and greater flows of ideas and capital between high- and low-income countries.&#13;
Integrating with the world economy can be a powerful spur to growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
Low-incorne developing countries with about 3 billion people have switched from exporting&#13;
primary commodities to exporting manufactures and services. Between the mid-1970s and 1998&#13;
manufactures increased from 25 percent of their exports to more than 80 percent. And per capita&#13;
incomes in developing countries increased by about 5 percent a year in the 1990s, with the&#13;
number of poor people declining by 125 million between 1990 and 1999.&#13;
But in developing countries with a combined population of about 2 billion, overall economic&#13;
growth declined in the 1990s and poverty has been rising, in part because these countries trade&#13;
less with the rest of the world and often suffer from conflicts, corruption, and poor governance.&#13;
Their poverty goes beyond the loss ofjobs and income-to limited voice and poor access to health&#13;
and education, all needed for the climb out of poverty.&#13;
It is widely thought that economic integration will lead to cultural and institutional&#13;
homogenization. But "globalizers" such as China, India, Malaysia, and Mexico have maintained rich&#13;
cultural traditions. What is true is that global trade imposes standardization, making it impor-tanit for&#13;
trade and investment agreements to respect local customs, social policies, and labor and&#13;
environmental standards.&#13;

c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight) valuations,&#13;
and exports at f.o.b. (free on board) valuations,&#13;
the IMF adjusts country reports of import val-&#13;
ues by dividing those values by 1.10 to esti-&#13;
mate equivalent export values. This approxima-&#13;
tion is more or less accurate, depending on the&#13;
set of partners and the items traded. Other fac-&#13;
tors affecting the accuracy of trade data include&#13;
lags in reporting, recording differences across&#13;
countries, and whether the country reports trade&#13;
according to the general or special system of&#13;
trade. (For further discussion of the measure-&#13;

OECD countries are not the only ones that&#13;
receive substantial migration flows. Migrant&#13;
workers make up a significant share of the labor&#13;
force in Gulf countries and in southern Africa,&#13;
and people are displaced by wars and natural&#13;
disasters throughout the world. Systematic&#13;
recording of migration flows is difficult, however,&#13;
especially in poor countries and those affected&#13;

Primary data documentation&#13;
The World Bank is not a primary data collection agency for most areas&#13;
other than living standards surveys and debt. As a major user of socio-&#13;
economic data, however, the World Bank places particular emphasis on&#13;
data documentation to inform users of data in economic analysis and&#13;
policymaking. The tables in this section provide information on the sources,&#13;
treatment, and currentness of the principal demographic, economic, and&#13;
environmental indicators in the World Development Indicators.&#13;
Differences in the methods and conventions used by the primary&#13;
data collectors-usually national statistical agencies, central banks, and  381&#13;
customs services-may give rise to significant discrepancies over time&#13;
both among and within countries. Delays in reporting data and the use of  N)&#13;

improving the quality of the data that it collates and disseminates. At the&#13;
country level the Bank is carrying out technical assistance, training, and&#13;

            This is the sixth edition of the World
            Development Indicators in its current format, the 25th since
            the World Bank began publishing a comprehensive set of
            development indicators. It begins with a report on the
            Millennium Development Goals, which set specific, measurable
            targets for development in the early 21st century. To
            measure progress, results have to be measured and for that
            good statistics are needed. Most of the statistics in this
            report are produced by national statistical agencies. The
            World Bank supports investments to improve the quality of
            statistics through a wide range of efforts. The Bank is a
            member of the Partnership in Statistics for the 21st
            Century, the Bank is working closely with its development
            partners to raise awareness of the need for the value of
            good statistics and to increase the resources available for
            statistical capacity building in developing countries. The
            World Bank Institute is offering training programs to build
            statistical capacity building in the countries preparing
            poverty reduction strategies. Through the International
            Comparison Programme (ICP), the Bank is working to improve
            the quality of data for comparing standards of living across
            countries. The Bank has established a trust fund for
            building statistical capacity.
