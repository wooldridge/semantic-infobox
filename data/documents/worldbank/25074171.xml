                                      FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                               2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . because we feel that if we limit our relationship only to the official type&#13;
or sitting at the other side of the table and discussing with, then we will not benefit fully.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is facilitated by their having a good, strong office here, is that it?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Exactly, exactly. And that is one of the big advantages, and advantages we&#13;
have, a very big advantage. Another advantage is that if there is a real problem, we&#13;
always can co-opt them. [Laughter] If we cannot solve something then . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can try Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Washington [inaudible] That is, of course, another. But they have been&#13;
very careful in sending people here, group of people, particularly the economists are very&#13;
good economists.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes. We've got the impression that, you know, the World Bank in general&#13;
seemed to turn quite a corner about 1979, â&#128;&#152;80â&#128;&#148;Ernie [Ernest] Stern had quite a lot to do&#13;
with it--of shifting away from a preoccupation with projects to more of a policy&#13;
orientation. Our impression, I guess, is already that here is somewhat different, that&#13;
you've had this policy dialogue--not a preconditioning kind of formal conditioning, but a&#13;
policy dialogue, as you say, going on from the very beginning. Is that right? Starting with&#13;
Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Right, right, right, starting with Bernie Bell. And that was really a big&#13;
advantage to us because if we had concentrated on project only, the impact would be&#13;
more limited. But to discuss, for example, what would be the right priorities for the first&#13;
five-year development plan, that we agreed at that time agriculture. But from the&#13;
discussions we learned a lot about the problems India faced with the first big plan on&#13;
industrial development. China also. So we were in luck with that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You had kind of almost a running seminar, I guess . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . talking about development strategy broadly.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. And we encourage the Western staff here not to&#13;
be inhibited in discussing about policy matters.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You mean the World Bank staff?&#13;

                                        Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                                   November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, the World Bank staff, yeah. So they should not feel that it is not&#13;
theirâ&#128;&#148;what you call itâ&#128;&#148;their area of . .&#13;
&#13;
[Brief discussion of physical arrangements]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: It is not their--they are not, they feel maybe inhibited to discuss policy and&#13;
only projects because with every, you know, you cannot have, just have an irrigation&#13;
system or irrigation projects without discussing the sector as a whole, for example,&#13;
whether there should be payments by the farmers for the projects. You know, the projects&#13;
can be used as a leverage, but this must be discussed. Now--and we don't like these&#13;
leverages. We want to have what is the best.&#13;
&#13;
For example, now we are discussing urban development, and we are coming up with a&#13;
number of very good ideas, but whether there will be a project or not is a different matter.&#13;
But we really have to cope with the urban problems, and they keep us, telling, â&#128;&#156;You&#13;
know what happened in some other developing countries.â&#128;&#157; They said, â&#128;&#156;If you give too&#13;
much subsidies for urban facilities, then people will more and more come into the cities,&#13;
and the cities becoming bigger and bigger, and at one stage then the government budget&#13;
will be burdened with subsidies to the urban population.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is what they're telling you now, or this was back in . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, no, no, no, no, not back so many years ago, a few, few years, the past&#13;
few years. And, you know, some of us really haveâ&#128;&#148;so, in other words, their role is also,&#13;
you know, to provide us more information about what is going on in the others.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: And because sometimes there is a tendency among us to consider our&#13;
problems as unique when actually so many developing countries are probably, are facing&#13;
similar problems. And we can benefit.&#13;
&#13;
The first time we benefited from the experience of other countries was in 1968 when the&#13;
World Bank sent a mission here for family planning. We startedâ&#128;&#148;we wanted to start a&#13;
program of family planning.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: And the World Bank sent a group of people from Pakistan, India, Egypt,&#13;
and some other countries. It was headed by a medical doctor who did a lot of work in&#13;
Taiwan and Sumatra--very well-known.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Westerner or . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Westerner, yes. I forgot his name. But from Pakistan that was the former&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
head of the family planning program, Enver Adil, and from India, [Chidambara]&#13;
Chandrasekaran, for example, very--and they were very frank to us. They told us about&#13;
what they did but also about pitfalls like statistics of women using a number of . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: IUDs [intrauterine device] ?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: IUDs and other things, pills, and so on, but they are counted twice! So it&#13;
was a good thing, and I never forget that experience because that was--and then we&#13;
developed a counterpart team here, and counterpart team worked hard with them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's when your program started then?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. That's right. Now, sometimes they send people here to learn about our&#13;
program. Then I told them, you know, â&#128;&#156;We learned from you!â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] But this&#13;
means that we can learn from each other so much.&#13;
&#13;
And the first time we had contact with the World Bank, Mr. [Mohamed] Shoaib, the vice&#13;
president, former finance minister of Pakistan, he sent us, he said, â&#128;&#156;I will send you a man&#13;
from the planning agency.â&#128;&#157; I remember his name: [Shah Mahmud] Sulaiman. And at&#13;
that time we were working on forms, how to--forms for the different departments when&#13;
they want to submit the proposal for projects. So he gave us one, and then it was&#13;
translated into Indonesian. So it felt easy because rest of it is this form from the Pakistan&#13;
planning agency.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. This is a project analysis form?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: A project proposal, because before that there was no project proposals.&#13;
[Laughter] Everybody made their projects up. And then some one of them asked us,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;You know, it's nice. We can fill it in, but what does it mean, 'crores'?â&#128;&#157; Crores! [all&#13;
speaking at once] He forgot to eliminate that! [Laughter] You know, itâ&#128;&#153;s in the form.&#13;
â&#128;&#156;What is this crores? Ah, this must be Mr. Sulaiman again. He forgot to.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] So&#13;
then you areâ&#128;&#148;what do you call it--make use of other people's experiences.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You can--shortcuts.&#13;
&#13;
Another example isâ&#128;&#148;but this was not with the World Bank. We wanted toâ&#128;&#148;when we&#13;
try to promote exports, we would like to set up an export insurance company, insurance&#13;
and guarantee, actually, export credit guarantee, but we do not know and so on. But&#13;
Malaysia already had one. So they sent their people. They came with their forms, and&#13;
since we have practically the same language here, this is also easy. So to learn from each&#13;
other is . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Didn't Richard Gilbert come here from . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes, from Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Pakistan, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: He was very . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A very aggressive fellow--neo-classical aggressive! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: And he fought the [International Monetary] Fund, yes, all the time!&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When did he come here? Was it in the middle '60s, I guess?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, â&#128;&#152;67, I think.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: â&#128;&#153;67. After the . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. After the change, yes. â&#128;&#153;67 or â&#128;&#153;68.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And [Robert S.] McNamara came out in, I guess, '68, met the president, met&#13;
you people. And you had shared a professor at Berkeley with him.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: [Laughter] He was also a graduate.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I guess actually undergraduate. What was the name of the professor? Davidson,&#13;
was it?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Davidson . . [both speaking at once] [Paul S.] Taylor. Taylor was chairman&#13;
in Berkeley at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But there was a Davidson, wasn't there?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. Davidson. Malcolm Davidson.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Malcolm Davidson. His daughter is married to one of our colleagues at&#13;
Princeton, and he has just taken over as dean of the Woodrow Wilson School.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: I see. His daughter?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The daughter is married to this chap. The daughter is also working in the&#13;
Woodrow Wilson School, running the, administering the undergraduate program in the&#13;
school. She's a lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: I see.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, McNamara--we've interviewed him several times, and he talks with great&#13;
&#13;
                                 Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                            November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fondness sort of about that visit he paid out here.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes, that was a veryâ&#128;&#148;it really, the relationship was established at&#13;
that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes. And he decided to send Bernie then; he gave him a special mandate to sort&#13;
of bypass the bureaucracy.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. We like it, of course! [Laughter] When later on the&#13;
World Bank made changes we keep asking why! [Laughter] Why do you make changes?&#13;
You know, why do youâ&#128;&#148;was it because the other offices of the World Bank, but why&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t you change the others? [Laughter] At least a few?&#13;
&#13;
But I am glad the World Bank and its ideas now also interested in Vietnam. I just came&#13;
back from a seminar . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, did you, huh?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . with the Vietnamese deputy prime minister and a few others are in&#13;
Indonesia organized by the HIID [Harvard Institute for International Development] .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. And they would like so much to know what was done in Indonesia,&#13;
particularly the earlier days, and we keep encouraging them. I told them, â&#128;&#156;You know the&#13;
first thing we did was to have peace with neighbors,â&#128;&#157; because at that time we had what&#13;
we called â&#128;&#156;confrontationâ&#128;&#157; with Malaysia and Singapore--actually, practically almost war.&#13;
Then the first thing we did was to come to peace with Malaysia. And the second thing&#13;
was we went back to become members again of the IMF [International Monetary Fund]&#13;
and the World Bank, and also the UN because we left the United Nations at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, you had?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes. So I--in other words we keep encouraging them to have peace&#13;
with their neighbors because at that time Cambodia was not yet . . .&#13;
&#13;
But the World Bank also organize seminars for the Vietnamese officials. That is a good&#13;
thing. And I think they will move very fast. It seems that they are . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They seem to be moving on, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, Ernie--go back to this. [apparently looking at a schedule of meetings]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes, yes, yes, all right.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So Joseph Stern: probably we should have arranged a meeting with [C.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Peter] Timmer, David Cole, and [Richard H.] Patten. Patten is an interesting man. He&#13;
was very much interested in rural development as a member of the group. He was in East&#13;
Pakistan before . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . in the old days, whatever the--in East Pakistan And we have got a&#13;
number of programs, among others to provide the local authorities with funding from the&#13;
central budget directly, not through the ministries, because if you do it through the&#13;
ministries it will take a long time and it may be used for all projects which are not felt as&#13;
a real need for the country. So we set up an arrangement to bypass all the ministries and&#13;
provide the funding.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And let the locals decide the use of the funds?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, what to do, what to do, with a number of guidelines like projects&#13;
which provide more employment and rehabilitation and so on, existing roads or irrigation&#13;
works, some of these, but they decide what to do.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This is a current project?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, it is still going on now, but it started in the early â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. It started in the early â&#128;&#152;70s, and Adam Khan [phonetic] will be able to&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes. That's very interesting. The resources for that are internal?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Internal, yes. Completely internal, and particularly when we got additional&#13;
oil money. [Laughter] That was a good opportunity to preempt the use of the oil money&#13;
for this purpose, and that's why we have problems with Pertamina. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. They were trying to preempt, too?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes! ! [Laughter] They were trying to preempt, too!&#13;
&#13;
Then at one stage, if I'm not mistaken, the World Bank wanted to provide assistance for&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: For this thing, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But Adam [phonetic] will be able to--I don't recall.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I'd like to know about that, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: If Iâ&#128;&#153;m not mistaken, the group who came here then work out a proposal, but&#13;
they put certain requirements to change the, you know, and we told them, â&#128;&#156;No, I think the&#13;
present arrangement is the right one. If you want to support us, please don't make any&#13;
changes.â&#128;&#157; And this is, indeed, some of the problems. Each of the mission they have&#13;
some, they feel that they must report back to Washington . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That they've made an impact, huh?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. There will be certain changes. [Laughter] And on that program we&#13;
were very, â&#128;&#156;No, no. No changes.â&#128;&#157; So if they would like to add additional resources, that&#13;
would be fine, but not--no changes. That was one area we had some disagreement.&#13;
&#13;
But they are here, Timmer, Cole, and Patten. I think we should . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, it'd be nice to meet them.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Now, Mohammed Sadli.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, we've met him already.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You've met him already, yes.&#13;
&#13;
Then Hadi Soesastro. He is a good man . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Good man.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . but he had no directâ&#128;&#148;what do you call it--experience in working . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. He's just an observer of society.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Emil Salim, before he was in charge of environment and population, he was&#13;
minister of communication, and he was vice chairman of the planning agency.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, was he?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, so he had a lot to do with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, he talked in a very interesting way that he played a role back then that&#13;
was, he said, sort of participant in orthodox development. Now he's come to believe sort&#13;
of in the alternative model of development, this more sustainable development,&#13;
environmentally oriented and so on. So he said he would give us sort of an exercise in&#13;
auto-criticism, that is, he was criticizing to some extent the positions that he was&#13;
associated with in the past. It was a very responsible and lucid exposition.&#13;

                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And radical!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And radical.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And radical!&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Radical. I see.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He was a very thoughtful in the sense of looking at the future. He was looking&#13;
very much in the long term and not in the short term.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He was criticizing the Bank as being somewhat bogged down always in&#13;
moving current projects and not having a very long-range vision ahead, sort of thinking&#13;
where things are headed, and wishing that it were concerned more withâ&#128;&#148;well, some&#13;
would say, had 20 years ago been thinking more about the environmental issues that we&#13;
now talk about. Of course, one could make that complaint about all of us, practically.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, well, this reflects something that is very important. There are changes&#13;
in what is important. I'm an introvert in the world of ideas, the world of, you know--and&#13;
we have to cope also with this problem. And sometimes we have to make sure: are these&#13;
just fashionable ideas or are they really something which is maybe something that is&#13;
really important because sometimes we also have to weigh--you know, if there are so&#13;
many children die before reaching the age of one year, a very high infant mortality rate,&#13;
then the first objective is to give more children an opportunity to live, to go through this,&#13;
and that should receive the first priority. And this we relate to that their parents can have&#13;
the necessary income and employment and so on. So that becomes a very important&#13;
matter. Then the problem of very high death rates of mothers when they get birth, then&#13;
that is very high, and even higher--in ASEAN [Association of South-East Asian Nations]&#13;
they are still having the highest actual rate, death rate, infant mortality rate and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Really?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And so the problem of priorities become not easy. And of&#13;
course every person in government or outside government has their own ideas about what&#13;
should be the priority, but if one has to look at the totality and then try to balance out this,&#13;
what is the [inaudible] right now we are having big fight. Some people want to develop&#13;
huge projects, chemical projects, related with oil and so on. And they keep saying, â&#128;&#156;You&#13;
know, if we don't do it now, then other countries will be ahead of us, and we will not&#13;
have the necessary marketsâ&#128;&#157; and so on. Oh, all kind of aâ&#128;&#148;of course, maybe that's true,&#13;
but after all there are other requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Like you are--you know, if you look at the island of Java, the roads are really, should be&#13;
replaced by highways, and we don't have trans-Java highways. We donâ&#128;&#153;t have it. Oh, we&#13;
have theâ&#128;&#148;what do you call it--the feasibility studies and so on. That was already 20 years&#13;
ago, but we keep postponing it for the simple reason because the rural roads are more&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
important, rural roads and also roads from producing areas to the harbors. So the people&#13;
in public works keep telling us about the importance of a Java highway. But maybe that&#13;
is true if we have the resources, but if we have limited resources, then we have to make a&#13;
choice.&#13;
&#13;
The same is true with our harbors. Some people continue to say that we need to expand&#13;
the harbor of Jakarta and the harbor of Medan in Sumatra for exports, but what about the&#13;
small harbors in many of the islands because there are so many islands and they depend&#13;
very much on harbors. So this is become a problem, and to find the right combination or&#13;
the right balance is not always easy. So we have to continue to review our thinking and&#13;
try to . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You've been resisting these big projects.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes, with a few exceptions like liquefied natural gas projects,&#13;
LNG. This has been a very important project for us, and we are now the largest exporter&#13;
of LNG to Japan and [both speaking at once] Taiwan and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And that's a cost-effective project, then?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. So it is not whether they are big or not, but cost-&#13;
effectiveness is important. And some are not very attractive.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is related somewhat to--I think it was the chap this morning, Minister&#13;
Hadi, was it, who was saying--we asked him, â&#128;&#156;What do you think is the most important&#13;
thing the Bank might have done?â&#128;&#157; He thought quite awhile, and he said maybeâ&#128;&#148;was it&#13;
the revised industrial strategy?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, the industrial restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Industrial restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He said that at the time, especially in the early â&#128;&#152;80s--that was his analysis--that&#13;
there were strong internal lobbies which would have prevented openness in the economy,&#13;
and he made use of the Bank in an effective way to push the case for industrial&#13;
restructuring, internal openness. And he thought that the Bank had played a very&#13;
important role in that.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Had played?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Had played.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This was the early â&#128;&#152;80s, I think. Is this true?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, it's been as follows, actually: in â&#128;&#152;83 oil prices came down, and â&#128;&#153;86 I&#13;
think there was the very sharp decline in oil prices. Now, during that time the idea is to&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
give more attention to non-oil exports and non-oil production became more attractive.&#13;
And when you see this fellow, Ali Wardhana, that would be a good opportunity because&#13;
he was the one who really got things changing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He pushed toward the export expansion?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, non-oil exports and non-oil production. Now, here both the World&#13;
Bank as well as the HIID were very useful, very, very helpful to us in opening up the&#13;
economy for imports but also to what we call â&#128;&#156;deregulate.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Deregulation.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, that's a word we like to use here, â&#128;&#156;deregulation.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] And, oh a&#13;
lot of changes were made like licensing, to get away with licensing, industrial licensing&#13;
but also trade licensing. So that was a good start.&#13;
&#13;
However, we are far from being finished.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I gather.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: This isâ&#128;&#148;you know, sometimes why is it not possible to do it in a&#13;
comprehensive way? The reason is actually we have the choice. The choice is not to do&#13;
anything or to do something little by little. And we prefer not--we prefer to do little by&#13;
little even though we would have preferred a comprehensive because you can't do it.&#13;
First, there are people with a lot of interests in protection and so on, but also it needs&#13;
education. I mean, you have to educate. This is the [inaudible] of the public.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, when you made that turn, Ali Wardhana was in charge, I guess, would&#13;
you say that that was because the ideas had sort of matured partly as they were pushed by&#13;
the Bank and by HIID, or was it more because the circumstances had changed, as you--&#13;
this notion of export-led growth had been around for a while, hadn't it? But as you say,&#13;
your foreign exchange suddenly fell out of sight and you were sort of forced by&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Now, there are two things. Actually, before that time, I think before&#13;
â&#128;&#152;83, the Bank wrote a report on industrialization in Indonesia. I think Helen Hughes was&#13;
the one that wrote it. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, Helen handled . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: One of them. And very critical about our industrial development, including&#13;
the banking, monetary policies and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Very critical. And oh, there was a lot of discussions, a lot of discussions.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So there was no agreement on that draft. Later on the few of us who realized that there&#13;
are many truths there, [Laughter] many correct things in it, we had more ammunition to&#13;
tell the others who were disagreeing with this draft report. But it was still a draft, never&#13;
published.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Never published. Then they started to--because you need the strong&#13;
arguments, and when prices of oil came down, it was much easier to convince others.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Just a detail--you said that was about â&#128;&#152;83?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Before â&#128;&#152;83.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, Helen Hughes, she must have left the Bank about â&#128;&#153;82, â&#128;&#153;81, something like&#13;
that, â&#128;&#153;81, â&#128;&#152;82.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So that was before that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was not Anne Krueger?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, no, no. It was Helen, Helen Hughes, yes. Anne Krueger was not . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: She came in in â&#128;&#152;82, I think.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: In â&#128;&#152;82, yes, but it was Helen Hughes. I remember.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You couldn't contain those two ladies in the same organization. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: There are a number of them!&#13;
&#13;
Oh, when you see this man, let meâ&#128;&#148;Rachmat Saleh. Now, November 26, 2:00 p.m.?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Now, he was at that time governor of the central bank. Oh, and he was one&#13;
who disagreed strongly with the report.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, because the report--or the draft report--criticized credit policy, and&#13;
at that time--oh, he is a good friend of mine, but [Laughter] he hasâ&#128;&#148;he felt that this&#13;
cannot be done at the time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The report said that credit policy was too loose?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, no. We at the central bank, you know, acted as not a central bank but&#13;
acted as the only bank. So there are manyâ&#128;&#148;there were a number of state banks and few&#13;
private banks, but the state banks had to carry out guidelinesâ&#128;&#148;well, not guidelines,&#13;
actually decisions. So ceilings of credits . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Credit allocation?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . credit allocations, and the central bank decide on rate of interest and so&#13;
on. You know, we have a lot of state banks; yes, we inherited from the Dutch. It was&#13;
nationalized in â&#128;&#152;57, I think, so they are still there. Now, these were called â&#128;&#156;implementing&#13;
banks.â&#128;&#157; Not real banks--implementing the decisions of the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
So now at this stage, completely changed, we started to make changes in â&#128;&#152;83, also, but the&#13;
most, the biggest changes took place in â&#128;&#152;88, complete deregulation of--they can decide on&#13;
their setting up their interest rates, and setting up new banks is much easier now, private&#13;
banks, private Indonesian banks as well as joint ventures with foreign banks.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This was [Machtarudin] Siregar, Mr. . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, no, no, no. Saleh. Saleh is now . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He's now in the department of trade.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, but the one who knows a lot about this reform, financial reform, is Ali&#13;
Wardhana and the present governor of the central bank. If it's not in here, but I'll write his&#13;
name. His name is [Adrianus] M-O-O-Y, Mooy. That is the present governor of the&#13;
central bank. I think that it would be good to--because this has been happening in â&#128;&#152;88&#13;
when he . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Was he there in â&#128;&#152;88?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes. He--you know, we have five years . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Five-year terms?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . terms in the cabinet and the central bank people also. You know, the&#13;
president has been re-elected after five years, [all speaking at once] and every time there&#13;
is a new cabinet.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: After the last election, I saw in the paper, they were proposing a two-term limit&#13;
on the president.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What we have in the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Reaction to President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But he had three, right?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, he had three. They actually elected him for a fourth; then he died. And so&#13;
in retrospective anger the Congress passed this limitation on two terms. The horse was&#13;
out of the barn already, you know! [Laughter] But . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But Mooy would be the right person to explain about that.&#13;
&#13;
Now, let me go on. Sadli, Emil Salim, yeah, and then Kemal Siber. Now, Kemal Siber is&#13;
an interesting person. He was the first IMF representative when we joined, we came back&#13;
to the Fund, but before that he wasâ&#128;&#148;he came back and forth here to Indonesia. The&#13;
director for Asia at that time was Tun Thin, I think. He is retired now, I think, and Kemal&#13;
Siber was one of the men, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: He's Turkish?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Turkish, yes. He was secretary general or something in the ministry of&#13;
finance in Turkey. And he went through those difficult periods, so he will be--oh, Bernie&#13;
Bell as the Bank representative and Kemal Siber was the Fund person.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the two institutions were very much in harmony with one another?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. That is a--I was always surprised when I read something about&#13;
their fights and so on because here we did not feel that much. I don't know how, but there&#13;
seems to be . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I suppose Bernie and the Bank were taking a fairly conservative line on&#13;
macro policy, weren't they? On demand management?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Monetary?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. And we ourselves, we don't make that sharp&#13;
distinction: this is the Fund and this is the Bank. We just discuss with both of them or&#13;
whoever is really interested. So when we prepare the big devaluations, you know,&#13;
sometimes we discuss it with the Bank people, sometimes with the Fund people, whoever&#13;
was at that time very active. Well, some people say you should discuss it with the Fund.&#13;
All right. But the Bank people are more . . . [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did your sort of focus of attention shift over time on average from the Fund&#13;
toward the Bank? Normally the Bank was a . . .&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: In the beginning, yes. When we hadâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--stand-by&#13;
agreement, stand-by agreement with the Fund, you know, at that time â&#128;&#156;Dear Mr. [Pierre-&#13;
Paul] Schweitzer.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You have to write a letter of intent. That was from 1967 to 1970, I think.&#13;
Then in 1970 we never had any stand-by agreement anymore, and we were telling&#13;
ourselves, â&#128;&#156;Whatever happen, no stand-by agreement with the Fund and no rescheduling&#13;
of debtsâ&#128;&#157; [Laughter] because this is really . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: On that--I'm sorry--the last point. More recently with the sort of Latin&#13;
American debt crisis and when people talk of debt restructuring, one has frequently&#13;
started to see, when people quote as an example of the way to go about it, how Indonesia&#13;
managed to restructure its debts in the late â&#128;&#152;60s, early â&#128;&#152;70s. We were wondering if you&#13;
recall that, how that was done.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. It was something I would like to discuss with you because this is&#13;
an example in which something was done for a developing country but never became a&#13;
precedent for other developing countries, unfortunately. You know, it went as follows.&#13;
Can I go into it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, please.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: When there was the change of government we were stuck with 2.3 billion&#13;
U.S. dollars of debt, outstanding debt. The larger part was to the Soviet Union and East&#13;
European countries and the rest to the Western countries.&#13;
&#13;
Now, it was clear that we could not make any interest payments and repayments, so--and&#13;
we realized that no new aid will be forthcoming unless something could be done. So the&#13;
first meeting we had was in Japan, and it is very interesting that in 1966 Japan took the&#13;
initiative to have the meeting in Japan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s interesting.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. And I think it was United States and others must have encouraged&#13;
Japan, but they were prepared to have the meeting there, meeting the Indonesian creditors&#13;
with Indonesia to discuss what can be done. So--but there were no solutions to the debts&#13;
at that time, but they learned more about our intention and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Then in December â&#128;&#152;66 we had our first Paris Club meeting, and there they agreed to&#13;
reschedule Indonesia's debts with three years grace period and eight years repayment, so&#13;
total eleven years. And we had to pay interest on the rescheduled debt.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Market interest or concessional?&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That was marketâ&#128;&#148;no, no, no. Not quite market, but also not really&#13;
concessional, something--and that went on for â&#128;&#152;66. That was â&#128;&#153;66, was for whatever was&#13;
due in â&#128;&#152;67 and the arrears. So--and because of the agreement in Paris in December of â&#128;&#153;66,&#13;
in February â&#128;&#152;67 the first aid meeting on Indonesia could take place in Holland, authorized&#13;
[inaudible] meeting, but that made it possible.&#13;
&#13;
And then we had annually two meetings with the Paris Club because they want to see&#13;
whether we did our homework or not [Laughter] every year. But then they found out that&#13;
we did at least most of what we were supposed to do. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
And then the idea came up to ask someone to find solution for Indonesia's debts because&#13;
with this annual rescheduling you would have to keep rescheduling all the time. So the&#13;
Paris Club looked for someone, and then they and Indonesia agreed to ask Mr. Abs,&#13;
Hermann Abs from the Deutsche Bank. There were few who was considered, but the&#13;
main then finally was Abs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I just read today that this gentleman is still alive.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Mr. Abs? He is still in Germany now, yes. And he made studies, and here&#13;
the role of the Bank and the Fund were important. They worked out all kinds of&#13;
projections: you know, I mean if you do that, if you do this, and if you do that and so on.&#13;
And both the people in the Bank and Fund provide us with a lot of information because&#13;
we did not know what is to be done. They inform us, these are the problems and so on,&#13;
and they work out for Mr. Abs all these debt projections for the future.&#13;
&#13;
Then Abs came up with this idea that there must be a final solution with these debts, and&#13;
it consists of a number of items. One is a 30 year repayment period of all debts in equal&#13;
amounts and no new interest, no new interest. And it should be . .&#13;
&#13;
[End of Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . and so military or economic uses of the debts would not matter, he said.&#13;
And also nondiscriminatory principles: this applied for all credits.&#13;
&#13;
So a number of the Paris Club countries were not happy with this proposal. They say, â&#128;&#156;It&#13;
cannot be done. It canâ&#128;&#153;t be done.â&#128;&#157; And so on.&#13;
&#13;
But then there was a . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Excuse me. Did the Bank say that?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, the World Bank? The World Bank did not say yes or no because . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You didnâ&#128;&#153;t have anyâ&#128;&#148;you hadn't borrowed from the World Bank, I think.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Excuse me?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Had you borrowed from the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, no. So they were there kind of assisting the Paris Club. You know, it&#13;
was interesting with the Bank and the Fund. They were there and they work out many&#13;
things, but actually the formal arrangement was with the Paris Club.&#13;
&#13;
Then we also suggested to the group there is no grace period, so we have some objections&#13;
because Absâ&#128;&#153; proposal lacked a grace period. Then there was some discussion: â&#128;&#156;Okay,&#13;
there can be a grace period, but then the repayment will be at the end of the 30 years&#13;
period, the last eight years. But for that purpose there will be some--interest will be&#13;
applied to whatever is postponed.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This was all official debt? You didn't have commercial . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Official debt. In the case of commercial debts, we--what we called a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;scheme,â&#128;&#157; it's called â&#128;&#156;DICS,â&#128;&#157; debt investment conversion scheme. So this could be&#13;
converted into investment and then . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A debt equity swap?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, now it is called a swap, [Laughter] but at that time we tried to&#13;
encourage investment, and we had foreign exchange controls here at that time. So&#13;
whoever, they can sell those debts but only to be used for investment in Indonesia. But&#13;
the major part was official debt.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was there any multilateral debt at that time? Or was it almost entirely the&#13;
official debt or bilateral [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Official, bilateral. Because, you know, we left the World Bank, also.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. And you had not yet borrowed from the ADB [Asian Development&#13;
Bank] .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, no, no, no, no. ADB was just starting in â&#128;&#152;66, yes, and we right away&#13;
joined the ADB. No.&#13;
&#13;
But a number of countries had problems, like Japan. They say, â&#128;&#156;That's against the law.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
In Japan they have this OECF [Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund] and there is an&#13;
OECF law, and they cannot agree to that. So we had some discussions with the Japanese,&#13;
so not only in Paris but we visited some of these countries, and we suggested them to&#13;
change the law. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: To change the law.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: To change the law. That would be most logical is that you can do that. We&#13;
told them, you see, most of these Paris Club countries, they are agreeable to this proposal,&#13;
but if Japan disagree, then they will not be in a position to agree; you know, I mean on&#13;
nondiscrimination and so on. And then Japan will be blamed and it would be difficult . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And what deal did you have with the Soviet Union?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Ah! Later. The Soviet Union was in the beginning invited by the Paris Club&#13;
to join, but they refused, they did not want. So we dealt first with the Paris Club.&#13;
&#13;
Finally the Japanese went to parliament and changed the law. The finance minister at that&#13;
time was [Takeo] Fukuda. He was also a man with a vision, and he thought, I think, it's&#13;
important to have good relations not only with the other Paris Club members but with&#13;
Southeast Asia and so on. So they changed, and as a result the agreement was established.&#13;
&#13;
Now, after we agreed with the Paris Club members--I mean a bilateral agreement, of&#13;
course--then we went to Moscow to negotiate with the Russians. And at that time we told&#13;
them, â&#128;&#156;You see, we have this agreement with the Paris Club, and there is a&#13;
nondiscrimination principle there. So our hands are tied. If you agree, then we will start&#13;
with repayments. If you don't agree, there will be no repayment at all. We cannot.â&#128;&#157; Oh,&#13;
after two days they agreed! [Laughter] And we could do that because we did not expect&#13;
any assistance from the Soviet Union, no assistance, no nothing. And from there then&#13;
Romania, Poland, and so on--we had debts all over the place from all of them. Only with&#13;
one country do we, could not: China, because we were not in talking terms at the time.&#13;
But now it is already written off--the debts are all paid, repaid with China.&#13;
&#13;
Soâ&#128;&#148;oh, and at that meeting in the Paris Club they keep telling us, â&#128;&#156;This is not to--this is&#13;
a unique case, and this should not become a precedent for other developing countries.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And it didn't, huh?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No! [Laughter] And then it did not, it did not, and it's very sad.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That is too bad.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yeah, well, we have no objection if it becomes a precedent. It could be a&#13;
good thing if it would become precedent.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It has become slightly more tricky maybe because at that time Indonesia had&#13;
primarily official debt and bilateral debt . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . but almost no multilateral debt. And for the World Bank and the ADB itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
very tricky.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes, yes, and I keep asking the World Bank people, you know, â&#128;&#156;Are&#13;
there no rescheduling of World Bank debts?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, thatâ&#128;&#153;s not possible.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Why?â&#128;&#157; You know, debts are debts, I mean whether it is due to England or France or the&#13;
World Bank, I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They also have a precedent that the World Bank did reschedule once . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Reschedule once.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . for India in â&#128;&#153;66.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: I see. Oh, that's a long time ago also.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It was a small amount, but they did.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: They did, huh. So weâ&#128;&#148;well, that is . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a very interesting story.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That was the rescheduling. And Siber could also be--he was there,&#13;
continuously, Kemal Siber, Bernie Bell and Kemal Siber. That's a good . . .&#13;
&#13;
Then let's go on. November 25th, Monday, after Kemal Siber you will see Soegito&#13;
[Sastromidjojo] . Soegito, he is now secretary general of the department of finance, but&#13;
before that he was director general for foreign economic relations at the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. So he had a lot of dealing with the World Bank. And even now he continue to be&#13;
active with the World Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
Then Suyono Sastrodarsono at 11:30. He was minister of public works, and before that he&#13;
was secretary general and before that he was director general of irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So. The first projects the World Bank started here was irrigation projects.&#13;
So he is the person at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Irrigation is generally thought to have been a successful program here?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes. Yes, it is successful. And we were very fortunate. On the part&#13;
of the World Bank they wereâ&#128;&#148;they sent quite good people on irrigation, agriculture and&#13;
irrigation. I think one of them is still around in Washington: [Heinz] Vergin. His name is&#13;
Vergin. [all speaking at once] V-E-R-G-I-N.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Vergin, heâ&#128;&#153;s now the desk officer on India.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Ah, I see.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Director, the country director for India.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Vergin, Heinz Vergin. He was a . . .&#13;
&#13;
The responsible man for agriculture was [Thomas C.] Creyke, Tom Creyke, at that time,&#13;
but he died some years ago, I think. And then Takasita [Shigeharu Takahashi] also, from&#13;
Japan.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: By the way, just as an aside, it's interesting to learn that about Vergin because&#13;
he said that irrigation work in India was now generally perceived to have been pretty bad,&#13;
a failure.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s--they were saying in the early â&#128;&#152;80s the irrigation work in India was&#13;
very good, but you see that--actually the 1981-â&#128;&#152;82 reports--whereas now in â&#128;&#152;91 it's&#13;
become very bad. But that's because in general a lot of southern Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s insecure and you&#13;
cannot separate irrigation from that environment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, okay.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Now then, Ali Wardhana. You know, Ali Wardhana is an interesting man&#13;
because he was finance minister in â&#128;&#152;68 until â&#128;&#152;83.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: My! That's a long time.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's like Suharto. When Ali Wardhana became finance minister I&#13;
mentioned to him, â&#128;&#156;You know, Suharto became finance minister for so many years. I&#13;
think you can beat Suharto.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Fifteen years.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, fifteen years, but then he became coordinating minister for economic&#13;
affairs for five years.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Does the finance minister report to the coordinating minister, or not really?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You know, all ministers are supposed to report directly to the president.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. But the coordinating minister actually has some authority to what we&#13;
call â&#128;&#156;coordinateâ&#128;&#157; these ministers and very much depends on personalities. Some are&#13;
effective; some are not very effective. We have three coordinating ministers: one for&#13;
economic affairs, social affairs, and political and defense.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We've understood that that's one way that you, your group--and people&#13;
sometimes just speak of you personally--have sort of retained a great deal of&#13;
effectiveness in the economic area because you're sort of separated from these other&#13;
quadrants. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Actually it is very important to have coordinating ministers. Actually,&#13;
if we had a prime minister that would be a deputy prime minister for economic affairs&#13;
because, you know, finance and trade and industry, they fight each other and somebody&#13;
has to straighten out these matters and put someâ&#128;&#148;like the finance minister needs a lot of&#13;
support because he has to take a lot of unpopular matters. And if you left him alone it will&#13;
be more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The coordinating minister has more contact with the president?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Depending on--in a way, yes. It depends very much on . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Personality?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Personalities. For example, when a minister went to see the president--&#13;
because that is his right; we report directly to the president--then he come back and&#13;
discuss with the coordinating minister what will be the further, what further steps should&#13;
be taken and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So the coordinating minister can be very effective in keeping the machinery more&#13;
consistent. You know, and if in addition to being coordinating minister you are also&#13;
chairman of the planning agency, that's even more effective because the planning agency&#13;
has to do not only with economic affairs, economic matters, but also with education,&#13;
health and . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It is the budget office, isn't it? I mean . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, that is the budget office, the development budget office.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Development budget office, both annual and five year, whatever.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. But five years is the more indicative one. The annual one is&#13;
more . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was there a time when there was someone who was both coordinating&#13;
minister and BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National&#13;
Development Planning Board] ?&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes, that's right: that was me.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was [inaudible] my question. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So that was easy. [Laughter] I didn't need to have another office for&#13;
coordinating minister because the BAPPENAS could be effective, you know, otherwise--&#13;
like, for example, every year we have to decide on a floor price of rice, you know, and&#13;
this has to be decided to encourage farmers to produce more . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sure, sure, sure.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . and this has to be done so many months before the planting season and so&#13;
on. Then you decide also on the price of fertilizer because itâ&#128;&#153;s linked with others; so the&#13;
ministry of agriculture and industry, trade, and so on. We have also what we call the rice&#13;
agency. They are supposed to buy rice from the farmers whenever the price is below the&#13;
floor price. Now, to do that you have to have some people working on it, and the&#13;
planning agency was the right . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. So . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What years were these?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: â&#128;&#152;67 I was in charge of the planning agency. In â&#128;&#152;73 in addition I became also&#13;
coordinating minister until â&#128;&#152;83.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Until â&#128;&#152;83?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Then Ali Wardhana became coordinating minister, but the president&#13;
thought there should be no double function anymore. [Laughter] So Ali Wardhana&#13;
became a coordinating minister. He--instead of . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He gave up the finance ministry?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: He gave up the finance ministry.&#13;
&#13;
And then a man who is not here [on the schedule] , Radius Prawiro, who is now with the&#13;
Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s group in [inaudible] [both speaking at once], he became the finance minister.&#13;
And then when Ali Wardhana was not coordinating minister anymore, Radius Prawiro&#13;
became the coordinating minister.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So it became a double function again?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, no.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're seeing the present finance minister, yes, yes, yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. But it is not a double function anymore. But it can be effective,&#13;
very effective, so like I think in Korea they have a deputy prime minister [both speaking&#13;
at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, sure. He's one of your colleagues in this [both speaking at once] he has&#13;
been on this committee [World Bank history advisory committee] you haven't come to&#13;
yet: Kim Mahn-Je.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Kim Mahn-Je, yes.&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, and otherwise, if you have two, then what is he supposed to do and what is&#13;
this man supposed to do or not to do and so . . . [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You were referring to the issue of some rice prices as well as the input prices&#13;
of, say, of agricultural inputs like fertilizers. And this, especially in the '80s, is a very&#13;
contentious issue with which the Bank has been involved, you know, with subsidies,&#13;
inputs, and other [inaudible] agriculture. Was that the debate here also with the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, not only with the Bank but a group of us feel there is too much&#13;
subsidies, but other people say no, we need the subsidies for the farmers and so on. But&#13;
actually thisâ&#128;&#148;there are huge subsidies for fertilizer and also this, the rice which is bought&#13;
from the farmer and then it is used for market operations to keep the ceiling price . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, and so effective, so. But also to--part of the salary of government&#13;
employees is paid in rice, you know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So we have been trying to get rid of this for a long time, but itâ&#128;&#153;s not been&#13;
successful because at one stage--that was in 1972--we had a very severe food crisis, very&#13;
severe, and the fact that government employees get, received rice, that was a big help.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Kept things more stabilized [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, but actually a number of us think that that is not needed&#13;
anymore. I mean, you need bureaucracy for that, to provide them with rice and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, sure. Wages in kind are a nuisance.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yeah. A nuisance, that's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, but still itâ&#128;&#153;s going on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           24&#13;
&#13;

WEBB: Did the Bank press a lot to remove the rice subsidies?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: They discussed it with us, but we explained to them that it is not yet&#13;
feasible.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They wanted toâ&#128;&#148;the effect would be to lower the price of rice?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: The ceiling price will be lower, the ceiling price, and there would be more&#13;
opportunity for the private sector, although now what is bought by the government is less&#13;
than ten percent of total production. It's very small.&#13;
&#13;
Ah! Peter Timmer will be able toâ&#128;&#148;yes, he has been right from the beginning (he was&#13;
very young at the time, â&#128;&#152;67 or â&#128;&#152;68, I think) working on this, and he continues to come&#13;
back every year here. He knows also what happened during those years.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because one of the things that people in the Bank--some reports say--is that&#13;
Indonesia has had good poverty results because they pay good prices to the farmers. So&#13;
they praise the rice price policy, but there seems to be a contradiction there in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
Youâ&#128;&#153;ve never . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, actually it goes as follows: the price of rice, the floor price, this has&#13;
been--every year it is increased, every year, and at the same time we increase the&#13;
fertilizer price. But the cost of producing fertilizer has been increasing also--primary&#13;
[inaudible] , you might say, because of oil prices. But also in addition to the subsidies on&#13;
fertilizers there is the subsidies to the difference between the floor price and the ceiling&#13;
price. The ceiling price is rather high for the urban population, and this is subsidy,&#13;
actually, we got, and this is what has been widely criticized.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Letâ&#128;&#153;s see if I get this: the ceiling price is the price to urban consumers?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. So actually that is a ceiling--you know, our rice&#13;
agency put the ceiling price. Whenever the price hit the ceiling, then they start selling the&#13;
rice.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You enforce the ceiling price by distributing the stocks?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right: by distributing stocks.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But you have a single price in the urban market? You don't have a price for the&#13;
poor?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Nothing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Nothing like that.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: We have nothing like that or, for example, with stamps and so on, nothing&#13;
like that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Nothing too [inaudible] about that.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But theyâ&#128;&#153;re responsible for price, the accounting price, actually, for&#13;
government employees. This is also high.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That I understand, but I don't understand why the ceiling price if it is enforced&#13;
by a buffer stock operation is the subsidized price.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, because they put it at the high level, at quite a high level, and the&#13;
government agencies running these operations, they need to cover the cost of their&#13;
policies and so on and bringing rice to different regions, and there is a strong feeling that&#13;
they are not that efficient.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: If it was a free market, would the farmers get a higher or lower price?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Most of the time what is purchased by the rice agency is rather small, less&#13;
than ten percent as I mentioned, less, because the price, actual price is actually already&#13;
higher.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, you could use a buffer operation that simply reduces the fluctuation, the&#13;
seasonal fluctuations of prices. As long as you don't run out of stock or don't build up&#13;
stocks unnecessarily then you're really not altering the behavior of the market except to&#13;
take the humps out of it . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . and that I think myself is a very socially benign kind of intervention.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But I still don't quite--I guess it's because youâ&#128;&#153;re--out of the ceiling price you're&#13;
getting the operating costs of the . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Agency.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . of the government agency that . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But also I think to the extent that, in Java in particular, if rural poverty was&#13;
with the marginal or landless, then higher rice prices--and they are net purchasers--would&#13;
adversely affect poverty.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. This is somewhat the problem that some who do not have&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
any land at all, they have to buy.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Exactly. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re net purchasers.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: And the high floor price will have an impact on them, but on the other&#13;
hand, those who have a small piece of land, they benefit from this floor pricing policy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, if they sell some of their product and they are self-supplying and have a&#13;
little surplus to sell, then they benefit, as do the larger farmers.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's the landless or the nearly landless especially urban consumers who are&#13;
adversely affected by a high price. But you haven't had a two price system. You know,&#13;
in India the opinion had been to--I don't know what the Bank thinks; I guess probably&#13;
they're against it--but many, many people thought you have to have a subsidized price for&#13;
the poor through some kind of segregated distribution. It's very messy.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Messy. That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. That's why we keep it simple. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s good if you can. Of course, in Sri Lanka they gave this great big subsidy to&#13;
everybody and got everybody very healthy and then into very serious trouble fiscally.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What's the extent of the total agricultural subsidies as a fraction of GDP?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: I don't know for sure because these are sometimes implicit subsidies. So if&#13;
this rice agency get credits from the central bank at the subsidized interest, so it doesn't&#13;
go to the budget. And this is the remnants of subsidized credits. It still continues. In the&#13;
past it was the normal thing, subsidized credits.&#13;
&#13;
Shall I go on through the schedule?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, please.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So Ali Wardhana and then [Johannes] Sumarlin. He is the present finance&#13;
minister.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Now, at present he is working to get this legislation on banking, the new&#13;
banking law, this environment, insurance, and pension funds. These are the three major&#13;
things, and we feel these are important legislation for future mobilization of savings,&#13;
particularly, say, of pension funds and insurance.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Everywhere in the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes. Here it's our idea to [inaudible] do this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Dave Cole help us under banking law. Then a man with the name of&#13;
Jenkins, Glenn Jenkins, from Canada, working with HIID, has been very helpful on&#13;
insurance and pension funds.&#13;
&#13;
Now, Frans Seda, he was minister of finance in â&#128;&#153;67 and â&#128;&#153;68. You know, when Bob&#13;
McNamara came here, Frans Seda was still finance minister. And then he was replaced&#13;
by Ali Wardhana, and he became minister of transportation.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think maybe we are going to have to bow out of Mr. Seda because that's&#13;
[Lewis and Webb speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, I was thinking the same.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think so.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Well, instead of Frans Seda to Sumarlin [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s more important to meet with Sumarlin.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Sumarlin would beâ&#128;&#148;and maybe we can rearrange this timing so that&#13;
you have more time with Ali Wardhana.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would be good, I think.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, so let's make 1:30 to 3:30, something, because they share the same&#13;
offices, the same building, so . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We can walk.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, just walk.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. Okay. Good. All right.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Then Ibnu Sutowo. Well, if you want to hear his side of the story of the&#13;
Pertamina [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It might be interesting.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. He was very unhappy in 1974, â&#128;&#152;75, but took away since--Ali&#13;
Wardhana as finance minister at the time took very important steps to manage foreign&#13;
debts. You know, the problem was when oil prices went up the revenue which has to go&#13;
through the government did not go, come all to the government, partly it was kept by&#13;
&#13;
                                 Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                            November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pertamina, and in the meantime Pertamina borrowed a lot from commercial banks. And&#13;
it's very interesting, you know, because commercial banks, when they see someone or&#13;
some agency earning a lot of money, then they come up with loans.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The same thing in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, exactly, yes, as an umbrella. You only get umbrellas when you don't&#13;
need them. Then you take away . . [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
Then, oh, they keep coming up with all kinds of projects. Fantastic! Including, also,&#13;
tankers, you know, I mean, all [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
So Ali Wardhana will be able to tell you also, and Sumarlin at that time, he was vice&#13;
chairman of BAPPENAS at the time. He had to find some solutions for this Pertamina.&#13;
And then at one stage there was a bank--if I'm not mistaken, the Republic Bank from&#13;
Dallas, you know--they were not prepared to--what do you call it?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Roll over?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Roll over, yes, roll over. And then it became a problem. Ali Wardhana was&#13;
finance minister at that time, and Rachmat Saleh was governor of the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, we're seeing him on . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, you will see him, and he will be able to tell you also about that time.&#13;
&#13;
And then some steps had to be taken to renegotiate these contracts and debts and so on.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the whole issue, this whole crisis, was it completely internally resolved&#13;
within the GOI [Government of Indonesia] or did the Bank and/or the Fund get involved?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, no, no. Just . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It was completely within the . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes, the only thing is, was at that time was that we decided to limit the&#13;
borrowing. Short-term borrowing was limited. And actually Ali Wardhana liked to use&#13;
this word, â&#128;&#156;blessing in disguise,â&#128;&#157; you know, becauseâ&#128;&#148;because of that crisis we were able&#13;
to be very stringent on foreign borrowing, so no state enterprise could borrow externally,&#13;
only the department of finance and the central bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: After this crisis?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And then when you come to the late â&#128;&#152;80s, like about a few months ago, the&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GOI again took that step, sort of clamped down and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you see, were the lessons different? Were they sort of forgotten? Or was it&#13;
a different set of circumstances?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. In â&#128;&#152;74-â&#128;&#152;75 it was just one company, Pertamina. Now, the latest one, for&#13;
example, it is the problem of promoting the private sector. [Laughter] Because it's good&#13;
in, you know, I mean in terms of privatization and the private sector, but the private&#13;
sector or some of these companies established arrangements with state-owned companies,&#13;
and then they start to borrow abroad. Now, and the commercial banks consider this as a,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Ah. Very good. The state enterprise will also be responsible for repayment of the debts.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
And that means the government because the government never let go of big state&#13;
enterprises. And then they became very loose in their borrowing. They just borrow at&#13;
very high margins. These are commercial loans, and the projects are not that . . .&#13;
&#13;
So the latest one is we took some steps against what we call â&#128;&#156;state-related projects,â&#128;&#157; not&#13;
state projects or government projects. This can be related: for example, a state enterprise&#13;
and a private enterprise form a joint venture, and then they could borrow from abroad.&#13;
But it is also possible that a private company invests here but have a captive market, and&#13;
the captive market is actually state enterprises. You have some arrangement that take off&#13;
these by Pertamina, for example, or other companies. Or they do some arrangement with&#13;
state banks so the state banks are doing the borrowing, but this is for certain private&#13;
companies. If something happens the state bank is responsible, and the government will&#13;
probably not let the state bank become bankrupt. So when the economy moves higher up,&#13;
so to speak, it becomes more complicated.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So actually similar but different. [Laughter] Similar but different.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But in both cases the resolution and the advice and everything was within the&#13;
GOI?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. Of course, we had a lot of discussions with the World Bank and&#13;
the Fund, but also we have another group of advisors. We have a number of advisors.&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You do have a lot!&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: We call it â&#128;&#156;advisory group.â&#128;&#157; It consists of Lehman Brothers . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes. We've heard.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . Lazard Freres, and Warburg. So we asked them to join forces and give us&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
advice.&#13;
&#13;
It started with the Pertamina crisis because we had to deal with many commercial banks,&#13;
and we had to review contracts and so on. They were very helpful in that, and they&#13;
continue to be helpful now. So, for example, they always provide us with what they feel&#13;
the international market is, because we have to borrow, for example, the central bank has&#13;
to borrow every year commercially. But it is not used. We call it a kind of a stand-by&#13;
loan. It has nothing to do with the IMF, but just to make sure that if there is a run on the&#13;
foreign exchange reserves, we can draw on this. But we have to know what the market is,&#13;
and these three groups, three houses, they assist us. And they have been one of the first&#13;
who warned us about this what can be called â&#128;&#156;over borrowingâ&#128;&#157; of state-related projects.&#13;
So we compared their views with the World Bank, and it seems to be consistent.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me ask you about this large incidence of advisors. I think this three sounds&#13;
like a very sensible commercial arrangement like hiring a--well, it's a financial&#13;
consultant. But you do have this large number of HIID people in different places; there's&#13;
the Boston University group and so on. It looks to me, from what I've heard, as though&#13;
it's a sign of your self-confidence, really, that you have this many. You can have all the&#13;
advisors but theyâ&#128;&#153;re not--you make up your own mind, and you sort of get inputs from&#13;
different quarters. But I would think that there might be some criticism within the country&#13;
that you're taking too much, leaning too much on outsiders. We just came from&#13;
Bangladesh, and there they're very, very concerned about self-reliance, you know. And&#13;
you know Rehman Sobhan, for example, in BIDS [Bangladesh Institute of Development&#13;
Studies] , the economist?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't? He was . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: I know Nural Islam.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I know Nural, too. He's an old friend. But Rehman is to the left of Nural&#13;
by quite a distance but a more strident critic of foreign aid and external interventions and&#13;
all that sort of thing. You don't get any of this kind of thing?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. There are some, but we don't worry too much because we have so&#13;
many things to worry about! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
You know, for example, when we heard about when a Fund mission comes to a country,&#13;
you know, people start throwing stones on them, you know. And the Fund mission came&#13;
here, and the central bank put a sticker on the car â&#128;&#156;IMF.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] I told them, â&#128;&#156;You&#13;
better stop that,â&#128;&#157; and they did.&#13;
&#13;
But indeed there are criticism and so on, but we informed them that we need a window to&#13;
the world, and it is very important. You canâ&#128;&#153;t do it yourself, all the time you're--and these&#13;
are very effective windows, actually, and they can be useful.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                              November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For example, when we introduced the tax reform, income tax--we introduced VAT and&#13;
then a property tax--the HIID was very effective. The man was Malcolm Gillis. He's at&#13;
Duke University now. Then the draft law came, and then it went into parliament and so&#13;
on. It was agreed, and then the newspapers, they said, you know, â&#128;&#156;Malcolm Gillis,â&#128;&#157; you&#13;
know. I was criticized and so on. Okay. I was criticized, but after a few weeks died down,&#13;
so no anymore.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, these advisors, their effectiveness is due to the fact that they know when to say&#13;
something in public. In most cases they don't say anything in public.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I gathered.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. And that is very helpful. That is very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
Also, with the World Bank and the Fund when we have discussions, you know, the&#13;
important thing is not that you publish the report on whatever it is on Indonesia, and then&#13;
the report goes everywhere, and then they will be saying, â&#128;&#156;The World Bank insists that&#13;
you should do it.â&#128;&#157; Just provide us with the essence and in unsigned report. I mean, just a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;non-paper,â&#128;&#157; you know. But this can become a basis of discussions, and this is much&#13;
more effective. But of course they have to publish reports, and that is all right. But there&#13;
are many of these non-papers . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Non-papers. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a good term.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They come from the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, oh, yes, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s or the Fundâ&#128;&#153;s.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They're not official.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: They're not official, and it is much more effective because you don't have to&#13;
worry about the wordings. The wording should be, should not . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Your own younger economists don't get, donâ&#128;&#153;t feel that theyâ&#128;&#153;re blocked by&#13;
these foreigners?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Ah. Well, there are quite a number who are involved in this process. Those&#13;
who are involved, they are very happy because they learn a lot, and I feel now we are&#13;
getting greatly improved papers from them, you know, ideas and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So right now, for example, one of the problems is--some people are arguing, â&#128;&#156;Why do we&#13;
keep this rate of inflation below ten percent? Why not increase it and then more can be&#13;
done for developmentâ&#128;&#157; and so on and so forth. Then these younger people start fighting,&#13;
arguing against that idea. This is very important for us.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Another was this idea, â&#128;&#156;Why do we not borrow domestically: bonds, issue bonds?â&#128;&#157; We&#13;
do not borrow at all, I mean for the budget, while other countries are doing that. And then&#13;
they [inaudible] We hope we can convince people who are interesting on domestic point&#13;
of view.&#13;
&#13;
But those who are not, you know, you cannot involve a [inaudible] involved with this.&#13;
They are not happy because they are not in the mainstream, but those who are in the&#13;
mainstream, I think, are.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I was wondering on this when we started off the conversation and you were&#13;
talking about the IMF, and you said that in 1970 stand-by was so strong and you made up&#13;
your mind that never again you would get involved in a stand-by arrangement with the&#13;
IMF. So what was the nature of that experience which made you feel that strongly?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Well, you see, in that stand-by you have to promise so many things, and&#13;
then there isâ&#128;&#148;what do you call itâ&#128;&#148;a kind of time scheduling from that and that and when&#13;
you do that; otherwise, they stop the release of funds and so on. Now, that in itself, you&#13;
know, you feel not happy, so . .&#13;
&#13;
[End of Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
[Begin Tape 2, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . so therefore we agreed among us that why don't we decide for ourselves&#13;
what should be done, but in deciding it let's get whatever ideas, informations and so on&#13;
from all the others so that we can do--this creates problems, for exampleâ&#128;&#148;what do you&#13;
call it--structural adjustment loans, you know?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The same sort of thing with the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes, from the Bank. Now, we did a number of things, trade&#13;
deregulation and so on, and then the Bank was prepared to provide us with the loan. And&#13;
we had problems in the Board [of Executive Directors] . The U.S. Executive Director&#13;
insisted there should be some provisions, but the management of the Bank said, â&#128;&#156;They&#13;
have done it already.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] â&#128;&#156;It has already been done! Why did you insist on that&#13;
should be done, this thing should be done and so on?â&#128;&#157; Finally they agreed, but again they&#13;
say that should not be a precedent for other countries. You know, every time that is that&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
So, oh, we had discussions with Mr. [Charles H.] Dallara. Dallara, I think, is from the&#13;
Treasury, and now it's Mr. [David C.] Mulford.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Dallara. [all talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Mulford, yeah, because they are the decision-makers, actually, what they&#13;
actually [inaudible] other Directors do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Like another advisor, huh? [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So this is the problem. You know, we thought that is a good thing to do, but&#13;
it's not enough. And it's become a precedent, so others will insist on that.&#13;
&#13;
Oh, yes. One day I was invited to--what do you call it--Tidewater?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Tidewater? Oh, the Tidewater meeting. Yes, I used to organize that. [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thisâ&#128;&#148;the aid givers. Yeah. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Yeah. The aid givers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes. The chairman of DAC [Development Assistance Committee] calls the&#13;
meeting.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, that's right. That's right. So I was invited to join one of their meetings,&#13;
and Mr. [Barber B.] Conable was also there of course and [William H. III] Draper and so&#13;
on and the rest. Then we had some discussion, and then I told them our good experience&#13;
with the World Bank, that these structural adjustment loans and we did things and then&#13;
we got the loan. And Mr. Conable said, â&#128;&#156;By the way,â&#128;&#157; he wanted to say something, he&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Indonesia did very well, but it is not a precedent.â&#128;&#157; [Laughter] Because, you know,&#13;
he had to be careful!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The American [inaudible] was there, probably.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, and other developing countries, they may insist, also.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: They partiallyâ&#128;&#148;well, India, you know, for the first time has taken a structural&#13;
adjustment loan three months ago, just now itâ&#128;&#153;s beginning, it's never taken an adjustment&#13;
loan. They did the same thing.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: They did the same thing?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, the government of India insisted that politically it could not do things&#13;
because of loan conditionalities. So they said, â&#128;&#156;You do these things first.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That is recently?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Recently, yes. Well, Manmohan Singh is a very good man. We have a lot&#13;
of discussions. You know, we are both members of the South Commission, and when he&#13;
came here, oh, we had a lot of discussions about what can be done, what can be done in a&#13;
country if you get the combination of the right people and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Manmohan is a very good man.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Manmohan is very good.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Heâ&#128;&#153;s shifted his position.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes, yes! We agreed to that! [Laughter] What is agreed in the&#13;
South Commission is a compromise. [Laughter] He is a very good man. I was so happy&#13;
when I heard that he became finance minister.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's a lot of work to be done.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
If I may finalize this, some of the names of these people.&#13;
&#13;
Ibnu Sutowo, no.&#13;
&#13;
Machtarudin Siregar, he was working here at BAPPENAS as deputy for economic&#13;
affairs, and he negotiated many loans with the World Bank in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Rachmat Saleh, before--he is now economic advisor to the government--before that he&#13;
was trade minister four, five years, and then he was also governor of the central bank for&#13;
about ten years.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Ten years?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, about ten years. And before that he was deputy governor general.&#13;
Now, the early days when we had to reschedule our debts and the setting up of the IGGI&#13;
[Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia] , that's [inaudible] meeting, we both, I mean,&#13;
Rachmat Saleh and I, we were working closely on this. So he would be able to provide&#13;
you with a lot of information about the early days.&#13;
&#13;
Saleh Afiff, who is now minister of planning, he, before he became minister he was vice&#13;
chairman of this planning agency and also minister for administrative reform. And before&#13;
that he was deputy for economic affairs. That was before Machtarudin.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Should we need more than the time . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: . . for Saleh because we [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, Rachmat Saleh, yes. I think so. [both speaking at once] I think so. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Should we postpone the next one to half past three [both speaking at once]&#13;
because we have to also go from there to . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: To the dinner. I see. Rachmat Saleh, yes, I think Rachmat Saleh should be&#13;
longer, yes. If it could be 1:30, that would be better. Saleh Afiff also has a lot to [all&#13;
speaking at once] He has been a . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We all had a sense that Saleh Afiff was one we wanted to be sure to have&#13;
enough time for.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Actually, if you rearrange this schedule so that we can have our meeting&#13;
earlier than two, that would be . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Earlier than?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Earlier than Tuesday. That's Tuesday, right?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think what--there are a lot of people here. We're not going to be able to see&#13;
everybody.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, but you will be here on Thursday, right?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I'm going to be here on Wednesday and Thursday untilâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll be here&#13;
Wednesday and Thursday morning. The plane goes at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Good. Then we will . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And I hope I can come back and see you.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. And then we can discuss further . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And if you can find anything about these Harvard types . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, Timmer and Dave Cole and--that would be very helpful--and Patten.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It would be very good. We probably better center this--whatever you want to&#13;
arrange for us is fine, but we should probably get you, if you would, to have your office&#13;
check with Nick [Nicholas C.] Hope so that we don't get double programming going on.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Oh, yes. I will check with Nick Hope, yes. I think it is&#13;
important that this office continue to make the arrangements. But, for example, Timmer&#13;
has just arrived today here from this--you know, he organized this seminar with the&#13;
Vietnamese.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see; I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: My sense was that if someone is an American, then we can probably easily see&#13;
them in the U.S. So we should try to meet as many Indonesians . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think that's right, Devesh, because we can go up to Cambridge and see Peter&#13;
Timmer and . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But Dave Cole stays here.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Dave is staying here, is he?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: For six months.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, well, then it would be nice to talk with him.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: And then Patten.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Patten is staying here too, is he?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: But next week he will have to go to Bolivia or something and then in&#13;
February he will be back in Jakarta. So maybe better to get at least these two.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think that [both speaking at once] well, Patten's subject also--well, Timmer is&#13;
also agriculture, but we can catch him in Cambridge. But I think Patten would be one that&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;d be, particularly like to talk with.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, certainly, Patten and Dave Cole. Together they can . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: If they could do it together, it would be fine.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, I think that would be easier. We can also . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Are there any people--Mr. Hadi [Soesastro] , I guess his name is, this morning&#13;
suggested that I guess it's the chairman of the department at the university, Dorojatun&#13;
[Kuntjoro-jakli]. Would he be a good person to talk with?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Dorojatun, yes. These are all good people, but they are not directly related&#13;
with the World Bank, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They haven't worked directly with the World Bank? We're probably interested&#13;
in seeing a few people who sort of an impression from outside, but of course our time is&#13;
short.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: That's right. That's why if we, ideally, if we can get together a few of them&#13;
and have group meetings that would be even better.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                            November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would be fine. Excellent.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One of the people we spoke to had said that, when we asked him where the&#13;
Bank underemphasized policies, he mentioned two areas: one was human resources&#13;
development and the other was spatial policy.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You mean regional?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. He said that these were two where, the Bank sectors, he perceived the&#13;
Bank's advice to have been not very good. I was wondering if you had any . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: On human resources they have given a lot of attention on education, on&#13;
family planning also. Family planning was very effective . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I gather.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: [inaudible] and the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s assistance was also very effective.&#13;
&#13;
On regional development, this is still big problem. You know, one of the problems of this&#13;
country is how to keep the country together [Laughter] with all these islands and so on. It&#13;
can split so easily. And so development has to take place all over the country, and it is not&#13;
always the optimum. You maybe better concentrate on certain regions, but it is not the&#13;
case. And then the choices sometimes become difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Now, for example, some of the bilateral arrangements with countries, they prefer&#13;
sometimes to concentrate on certain regions because then to provide assistance to one&#13;
project, another project, another--they are related to each other and then they can show&#13;
this is the result. But it is at the cost of other regions.&#13;
&#13;
And the Bank has been trying not to concentrate in any region. I mean, we disagree if&#13;
they propose certain regions only because there are many. Now, so their activities is not-&#13;
-you know, you cannot say it is in all regions because the other regions are taken care of&#13;
by other, by bilateral donors.&#13;
&#13;
So in other words we have to watch out for ourselves that all these regions get their share.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: BAPPENAS watches the whole scene, I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank is a kind of a residual donor, almost, sort of filling in where the&#13;
others don't . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, yes, and also we realize there are limitations. You cannot expect them&#13;
to do . . .&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has the recent increase in Japanese loans, which has really increased a lot in&#13;
Indonesia and now I think the net transfers from Japan are much more than that of the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has that made a difference in relative sort of dialogue or policy, if you&#13;
compare the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. Now, the Japanese are quite interesting. You know, when we had this&#13;
crisis because of two things, oil imports came down substantially and at the same time&#13;
this realignment of exchange rates between the dollar and the yen and we had a lot of&#13;
debts in yen, and our earnings from oil was in dollars . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, boy!&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . so we had that problem. So the first thing that we did was to have&#13;
discussions with Japan and explain to them these things, and then what they did was to&#13;
check with the World Bank: â&#128;&#156;Is that correct?â&#128;&#157; And this is one of the important thing,&#13;
that we have discussions with the World Bank and the Fund and so on, so that whenever&#13;
one of these countries asks, then they get not the same but similar answers or consistent&#13;
answers. And then they come up with this huge assistance or substantial increase, and&#13;
actually the increase is in program, program assistance, but not only from OECF. But at&#13;
that time the Japan action plan also tried to recycle . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: On harder terms?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: . . on harder terms, but the terms compared to the World Bank terms is not&#13;
that much harder, but similar. And they could be used also for--untied loans could be&#13;
used for imports, whatever imports, and the local currency can be used for providing&#13;
local financing for World Bank projects. So Japanese aid untied but program aid,&#13;
actually, the local currency was used for World Bank projects and ADB projects, so&#13;
because they say they agreed if it is used for World Bank projects because they believe&#13;
that the World Bank projects has been well prepared.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's pretty enlightened aid, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes. So it is very important, and you have to keep the Japanese continue&#13;
this practice: the World Bank projects, Asian Development projects, and so . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: This is probably also a case where is no other precedents.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: No, they didn't say that. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t say that. [Laughter] They didnâ&#128;&#153;t say&#13;
that. And I think we should encourage Japan to continue because they have the means.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, indeed. That sounds very good.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: They have the means.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When you're talking about holding the country together, it occurred to me--we&#13;
were just in Bangladesh, and one of the great issues there is whether they're going to have&#13;
this bridge across the river. There's a tremendous national push for it, and it probably is&#13;
not a very cost-effective proposition, and it occurred to me that maybe you're lucky that&#13;
the islands are far enough apart so you can't build bridges!&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, wait! Some people are working on the idea to put a bridge between&#13;
Sumatra and Java! [Laughter] Oh, yes! With some Japanese.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Japanese?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How far is that?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, they are quite far, and in between there is that volcano, Krakatoa. But&#13;
actually the traffic is now quite heavy, and we use ferries.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I mean, moving people is very important. I should think you could be justified&#13;
in subsidizing anything almost that would be boat travel between the islands.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Boat travel, yes, and projects, for projects also. But you know this is when&#13;
people in other countries get together with some from the developing countries and they&#13;
are in the same field, then a project will be developed, in this case so-called â&#128;&#156;high&#13;
technology.â&#128;&#157; Then these scientistsâ&#128;&#148;you know, I mean the Japanese say, â&#128;&#156;You know we&#13;
are linking our islands with bridges or with tunnels and so on. Why don't you do that? â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can't do it--if you've got a volcano there you can't put a tunnel through it!&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: So, you know, in many cases one has to watch out. You cannot rely on&#13;
others to take care of your . . . [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
But there is the one thing which I really appreciate the World Bank. They have been&#13;
careful in their sending of people here, you know. Not all, but most of them are very good&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do any names stand out?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes. Apart from Bernie Bell, we had Jean Baneth; do you know? The&#13;
Frenchman. And D. C. Rau. D.C. Rau was very good.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: D.C. Rau, yes, was very good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                             November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, and Attila Sonmez, who is now in Beijing; he was also. And now we&#13;
have Nick Hope.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham was . . .&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Of course, Russ Cheetham. Iâ&#128;&#153;m sorry. I forget. [laughter] Russ Cheetham&#13;
of course wasâ&#128;&#148;oh, he was very, very good. Russ Cheetham.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And Nick Hope is looking good?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, youâ&#128;&#153;re right: a good string of people there.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Yes, and thatâ&#128;&#153;s theâ&#128;&#148;we are lucky because you can get a person who is&#13;
disagreeable on many ways, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
And the economists they send are also good. One of them is back now, before Jim [James&#13;
Q.] Harrison was here, Mark Baird from New Zealand. Mark Baird, B-A-I-R-D, Mark&#13;
Baird. Good.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There's a young economist--I don't know how young he isâ&#128;&#148;Mark Pitt from the&#13;
University of Minnesota--who has done some work on Indonesia, but not for the Bank, I&#13;
think.&#13;
&#13;
You know, you've been very generous with your time.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, no, no, no! I am at your [inaudible] But let's get together again,&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, by all means.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Where do you stay?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At the Oriental [all talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Okay. Is this for me [apparently the schedule] ?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, sure. You can have that, by all means.&#13;
&#13;
[short discussion of hotel and room numbers]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: We will get together again.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. Terrific.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: You know, on Tuesday you have a meeting with Ali [Wardhana] , or&#13;
&#13;
                                 Widjojo Nitisastro&#13;
                            November 23, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monday with Ali?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Should we meet Mr. [B. J.] Habibie?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Oh, of course. That would be interesting. But he has big ideas. You know,&#13;
we have a minister for science and technology, and he has, oh, all kinds of things, to&#13;
build our own airplanes and so on. We have an airplane factory, actually, what do you&#13;
call it . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Assembly?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Assembling. But maybe if you are short of time . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He's not export oriented?&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: He said we are going to export it to the Middle East or--first it was to Iran&#13;
and then to Iraq but not again. [Laughter] But, well, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's a common thing that ministers of science and technology for LDCs [less&#13;
developed countries] have a certain mindset.&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
[discussion of exchange of business cards]&#13;
&#13;
WIDJOJO: Okay. Thank you very much.&#13;
