   IFC GOVERNANCE&#13;
   The International Finance Corporation's member countries, through a Board of Governors and a Board of Directors, guide IFC's programs&#13;
   and activities. Each country appoints one governor and one alternate. IFC corporate powers are vested in the Board of Governors, which&#13;
   delegates most of its powers to a board of 24 directors. Their voting power on issues brought before them is weighted according to the&#13;
   share capital each director represents.&#13;
     The directors meet regularly at World Bank Group headquarters in Washington, D.C., where they review and decide on investment&#13;
   projects and provide overall strategic guidance to IFC management. Directors also serve on one or more of five standing committees,&#13;
   which help the Board discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies and procedures.&#13;
     The Audit Committee advises the Board on financial and risk management, corporate governance, and oversight issues to enhance&#13;
   Board decision-making on these matters; the Audit Committee regularly reviews its terms of reference to reflect the evolving scope&#13;
   and responsibilities of audit committees' roles in oversight and risk management. The Budget Committee considers certain aspects&#13;
   of business processes, administrative policies, standards, and budget issues that have a significant impact on the cost-effectiveness&#13;
   of Bank Group operations. The Committee on Development Effectiveness advises the Board on selected issues concerning operations&#13;
   and policy evaluation and development effectiveness with a view to monitoring progress toward the Bank's mission of poverty&#13;
   reduction. The Personnel Committee advises the Board on compensation and other significant personnel policies. Directors also serve&#13;
   on the Committee on Governance and Executive Directors' Administrative Matters, whose name now reflects the expansion of its mandate&#13;
   to include Board governance.&#13;
     James D. Wolfensohn is president of each World Bank Group institution: IFC; the World Bank--which consists of the International&#13;
   Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA); the Multilateral Investment&#13;
   Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Mr. Wolfensohn also serves&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    hat a difference a year makes. Last year, IFC faced record-setting levels of&#13;
     W&#13;
                    loss provisions,mainly reflecting our portfolio exposure inArgentina.This year,&#13;
     by contrast,has exceeded our most optimistic projections.Helped by declining interest&#13;
     rates and improvements in the business climates of some markets,our operating income&#13;
     was well over $500 million, more than three times last year's figure and one of our&#13;
     highest on record.More important,the institution showed some real growth again,with&#13;
     commitments 25 percent over those of the previous year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Among the new investments,some 67 percent were in sectors                                 It is interesting to reflect on these results in light of the&#13;
     we prioritize because of their high development impact:                               substantial reorganization that IFC underwent at the&#13;
     financial markets,infrastructure,information technology,and                           beginning of the fiscal year. We decided to pursue these&#13;
     health and education. Lending to small and medium                                     changes because we recognized that the needs of the frontier&#13;
     enterprises directly and through intermediaries amounted to                           markets could be better met by a strategy and structure that&#13;
     $450 million, or 12 percent of new financing for IFC's                                went beyond our traditional,Washington-centric approach to&#13;
     account.Our overall portfolio,including guarantees and other                          project finance. The financing of private companies and&#13;
     risk management products,grew by more than 8 percent for                              entrepreneurs in developing countries required quicker&#13;
     the fiscal year.                                                                      responses, a wider array of products--including technical&#13;

8  MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Looking Ahead&#13;
A number of challenges remain ahead of us. Other&#13;
multilateral development banks are increasingly offering&#13;
competing financial products, and market conditions are&#13;
expected to remain volatile. We have yet to reap the full&#13;
potential synergies that are spread across our growing&#13;
noncommercial activities, ranging from technical assistance&#13;
and investment climate research to environmental and social&#13;
expertise and the various project development facilities.&#13;
  We also need to establish better ways to measure the&#13;
effectiveness of these noncommercial activities.And we need&#13;
to build on the Equator Principles to bring more of the&#13;
world's global businesses on board with sustainability.&#13;
  We can face the new fiscal year, however, with a renewed&#13;
resolve.We are well positioned to take on such critical tasks&#13;
as revising the IFC safeguard policies, mainstreaming the&#13;

&#13;
                    sustainable economic development through the private sector. We pursue&#13;
&#13;
      this goal through innovative solutions to the challenges of development, as we&#13;
&#13;
      invest in companies and financial institutions in emerging markets and as we help&#13;
&#13;
      build business skills.We consider positive developmental impact an integral part of&#13;
&#13;
      good business, and we focus much of our effort on the countries with the&#13;
&#13;
      greatest need for investment. We recognize that economic growth is&#13;
&#13;
      sustainable only if it is environmentally and socially sound and helps&#13;
&#13;
      improve the quality of life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

Innovation...&#13;
In fiscal 2003, IFC pioneered a number of new approaches to private sector development.&#13;
&#13;
· In Mexico, we entered the municipal finance market for               · From India to Russia to Vietnam, we invested in&#13;
  the first time.                                                        cutting-edge information technology firms and trained&#13;
&#13;
· In China, we developed a new approach to the problem                   workers to increase their high-tech skills.&#13;
&#13;
  of nonperforming loans.                                              · In all regions, we worked to increase the role of smaller&#13;
&#13;
· In Tajikistan, we helped a private company restore                     businesses as suppliers of goods and services to the larger&#13;
&#13;
  hydropower plants while ensuring affordable energy for                 companies in which we invest.&#13;
&#13;
  local people and safeguarding the environment.&#13;

&#13;
                                 STRUCTURED FINANCE&#13;
                                 IFC increasingly offers structured finance solutions to clients, including partial credit guarantees and&#13;
                                 securitizations. These tools are part of IFC's broader strategy to help build domestic capital markets&#13;
                                 and expand the local currency financing options for clients in developing countries. The bond issues&#13;
                                 that result enable clients to raise a significantly larger amount of capital than that represented by IFC's&#13;
                                 own exposure. By guaranteeing part of the risk in financing transactions, we encourage investors,&#13;
                                 especially financial institutions and institutional investors, to participate in transactions that they would&#13;
                                 not otherwise consider. Typically, our involvement serves to enhance credit and lengthen tenors.&#13;
                                   Clients benefiting from structured finance activities in fiscal 2003 included a university in Chile&#13;
                                 (see box, p. 51), a leasing company in Saudi Arabia, a telecommunications company in Thailand, and&#13;
                                 banks in Brazil and Russia. In Colombia, IFC worked with a secondary mortgage company, a bank,&#13;
                                 and a firm providing water and sanitation service in the city of Barranquilla. Through all our structured&#13;
                                 finance transactions, IFC mobilized a total of $836.75 million during FY03.&#13;

       Impact...&#13;
       IFC seeks out business sectors with the greatest potential for raising living standards.&#13;
&#13;
      We place special emphasis on countries that have low                   · But because investment alone is sometimes insufficient,we&#13;
      incomes or present high risks for investors,and we pinpoint              provide technical assistance and advisory services to help&#13;
      ways that they can improve their investment climates.We                  ensure that business loans and equity investments,now and&#13;
      also remain committed to addressing the evolving needs of                in the future, will have sustained economic benefits.&#13;
      the private sector in middle-income countries.                         · In countries experiencing economic downturns, we also&#13;
      · For our investments--ranging from a port in Pakistan to                play a critical role, making working capital available and&#13;
        microfinance banks in Azerbaijan, Chad, and El                         leading the way for the private sector to invest again.&#13;

&#13;
      THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES&#13;
      In June 2003, ten major international banks adopted the Equator Principles, a voluntary set of&#13;
      guidelines based on the environmental and social guidelines and safeguard policies of IFC. These&#13;
      principles will be applied to the project finance activities of these banks, globally and in all industry&#13;
      sectors. In drafting the Equator Principles, the banks received extensive advice and guidance from&#13;
      IFC. These ten banks underwrote about $14.5 billion in project loans during 2002, representing&#13;
      some 30 percent of the project loan syndication market globally. The following banks&#13;
      adopted the Equator Principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      · ABN AMRO Bank, N.V.            · HVB Group&#13;
&#13;
      · Barclays PLC                   · Rabobank&#13;
&#13;
      · Citigroup, Inc.                · Royal Bank of Scotland&#13;
&#13;
      · Credit Lyonnais                · WestLB AG&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Sustainability...&#13;
Sustainable development--improving corporate governance and taking environmental and social issues&#13;
into account--is at the heart of IFC's business.&#13;
&#13;
But we go even further:we explore ways to turn sustainable               · We helped industrial companies reduce greenhouse gas&#13;
development into commercial opportunities.Fiscal year 2003                  emissions, in some cases through sales in an emerging&#13;
saw a range of these activities:                                            market for carbon emission credits.&#13;
· We maintained our commitment to smaller businesses by                  · We educated employers and workers through the&#13;
  providing a wide range of technical assistance and                        IFC Against AIDS program and helped the Brazilian&#13;
  advisory services and by helping financial institutions                   government launch its Zero Hunger initiative.&#13;
  serve these clients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   PROVIDING ELECTRICITY AND SAFEGUARDING THE ENVIRONMENT&#13;
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the subsequent civil war, and sharp economic decline, the diesel generation plants in the&#13;
   Gorno-Badakhshan region of eastern Tajikistan ceased to operate. As a result, the population of this very poor region has come to depend&#13;
   on wood as fuel, and an estimated 70 percent of the tree cover has been cut down in a decade. Schools and other public&#13;
   institutions have had to close during the coldest weather, indoor pollution has become acute, and economic activity has been stifled.&#13;
   IFC and the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development have established Pamir Energy, a private concessionaire that is taking control&#13;
   of hydropower plants and other facilities that serve 250,000 residents and were previously state owned. The project, the first private&#13;
   investment in the power sector in Tajikistan, will double the capacity of a Soviet-era power plant, improve transmission and distribution&#13;
   facilities, and regulate the level of a lake to ensure adequate flow in the winter. The project also aims to reduce emissions and natural&#13;
   resource depletion. It will create local contract employment during construction, and a more reliable power supply will contribute to the&#13;
   region's economic recovery.&#13;
&#13;
     IFC is investing $8 million in the new company, of which $3.5 million is in equity and $4.5 million in loans. With donor support, we&#13;
   earlier provided the technical assistance needed to structure and fund this investment. In an innovative example of IFC­World Bank&#13;
   cooperation, IDA is providing $10 million to the Tajik government to help keep tariff rates affordable for the local population. A further&#13;
   grant from the Swiss government will ensure that a minimum monthly supply of electricity is delivered at a very low rate to even the&#13;
   poorest households.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          FC focuses its efforts where they make the greatest difference. We invest in the sectors&#13;
       I&#13;
          and countries that the private sector is unwilling or unable to enter on its own,either&#13;
       because of an adverse economic situation or because business success has not been&#13;
       demonstrated there before. We also play a catalytic role for other project sponsors,&#13;
       including commercial banks, to invest in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
       Through technical assistance,advisory services,and research,we are helping developing&#13;
       countries improve their investment climates and strengthen the capacity of their&#13;
       private sector to expand and operate.These nonlending services from IFC and itsWorld&#13;
       Bank Group partners help ensure that a country's economy will benefit over the long&#13;
       term from private sector investment.&#13;
         IFC also demonstrates its commitment to countries in economic crisis, playing a key&#13;
       countercyclical role when there is a retreat of private capital.In fiscal 2003,we helped clients&#13;
       in Brazil and Argentina secure vital trade financing, in collaboration with international&#13;
       banks through the B-loan program (see box, p. 53). Similar investments we made in East&#13;
       Asia during the crisis of the late 1990s have brought long-term economic benefits.&#13;

indicators on business regulations and their enforcement&#13;
and by analyzing the relationship of these regulations to&#13;
economic outcomes.The indicators can be compared over&#13;
time and across more than 130 countries. Topics covered&#13;
include business registration, labor regulations, contract&#13;
enforcement, creditor rights, and bankruptcy. New topics&#13;
will be added in 2004 and 2005 and updated annually.&#13;
Findings will be published in the annual Doing Business&#13;
report--launched this year in both Web and hard-copy&#13;
versions--as well as an online database of indicators,&#13;
academic papers, and country analyses.&#13;

   STRENGTHENING ECONOMIES THROUGH BUSINESS EDUCATION&#13;
   The successful development of emerging economies--and of IFC's client companies--depends on the skills and experience of&#13;
   local people. With this in mind, IFC is partnering with business schools around the world to launch a pilot program, the Global&#13;
   Business School Network. The goal is to build the capacity of local businesspeople by working with schools of business&#13;
   management in developing and transition countries. Focusing on the needs of local firms, the capacity building will include&#13;
   faculty training, fellowships, development of locally relevant curricula such as case studies and other teaching materials, and&#13;
   e-learning.&#13;
     This unique approach is enlisting the participation of leading global business schools. It creates--for the first time--&#13;
   a multilateral approach to managerial capacity building, enabling activities that an individual school could not carry out on its&#13;
   own. By making global business knowledge more applicable and accessible to local firms, including small and medium&#13;
   enterprises, the initiative addresses the shortage of business management skills, a major factor inhibiting growth and&#13;
   poverty reduction.&#13;
     IFC is providing support to the pilot initiative for FY04 and has established a unit to promote and administer its activities.&#13;
   Through its experience and contacts, IFC can help bring together schools, firms, and interested donors to develop sustainable&#13;
   education programs in business management. Early results will be assessed in the coming year.&#13;

       Priority Sectors for Development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           FC emphasizes sectors that have a high impact on the economies of developing&#13;
       I&#13;
           countries,because they reach large numbers of people or benefit many other sectors&#13;
       of the economy.These priorities include the financial sector, health and education,&#13;
       infrastructure, information and communication technologies, and small and medium&#13;
       enterprises: together, they represent about 70 percent of IFC's operations.&#13;
&#13;
       For these and other sectors, we also aim for development impact by providing technical&#13;
       assistance and advisory services.&#13;
       · The financial sector. IFC's work ranges from capital investments in existing&#13;
         commercial banks to establishment of new microfinance institutions. Equally critical&#13;
         are the training and advice IFC provides to improve corporate governance, share&#13;
         knowledge about best practices, and extend lending to reach even the poorest people.&#13;
&#13;
       · Infrastructure. IFC helps increase private sector involvement in providing clean water,&#13;
         electricity, and better transportation to more people in developing countries.&#13;
         The municipal water company inTlalnepantla, Mexico, is an innovative example.&#13;
&#13;
       · Health and education. IFC is helping expand the role of the private sector in&#13;
         hospitals and schools, facilities that have sometimes been seen as solely the concern of&#13;
         governments. In addition to investing in a university in Chile and a producer of&#13;

   LOCAL ARTISTS--GLOBAL SALES&#13;
   IFC gets wired with its $1.5 million equity investment in Novica, a Web-based art and artisan marketplace. Novica's Internet&#13;
   presence--which includes online retail, wholesale, and catalog distribution channels with sourcing hubs in seven developing&#13;
   countries--creates a link between more than 1,800 artist and artisan groups in emerging market countries and consumers throughout&#13;
   the world. The project had its origins in a $200,000 grant from IFC's Capacity Building Facility to upgrade the skills of supplier&#13;
   artisans in Ghana, Indonesia, Peru, and other countries.&#13;
     IFC's investment in Novica will not only help these small-scale producers find their way out of poverty but also help others as&#13;
   success allows for the hiring of additional employees. It also broadens the use of technology among people who were not previously&#13;
   part of the global marketplace.&#13;
     Novica's focus on quality and authenticity helps its artisans preserve their cultural heritage and prevents the loss of&#13;
   high-quality skills that often occurs when craftsmen focus on low-cost buyers. IFC is also working with Novica's artisan groups to&#13;
   build supplier capacity, allowing them to enter more profitable markets. The Novica Web site is www.novica.com.&#13;

          technical assistance and advisory services that strengthen businesses. Key capacity-&#13;

      Small and Medium Enterprises&#13;
      Small and medium enterprises--companies with 10 to 300 employees and annual sales of $100,000&#13;
      to $15 million--are the lifeblood of developing economies, especially those that attract little foreign&#13;
      direct investment.&#13;

   INVESTMENT AT THE GRASS-ROOTS LEVEL&#13;
   In frontier markets where private capital flows are limited at best, grass-roots groups' income generation projects can make a big&#13;
   difference in poor people's lives. This year, for example, the Mekong Private Sector Development Facility helped create a&#13;
   commercially viable small business in partnership with Hagar, a Cambodian nongovernmental organization that has rebuilt the lives&#13;
   of 20,000 destitute mothers and children over the past decade.&#13;
     MPDF has been active with Hagar since 1999, providing business advice on the planned commercialization of the nonprofit&#13;
   group's silk handicrafts and soy milk production activities. For the latter, MPDF conducted a market study that showed great&#13;
   potential demand for a repackaged product. It then helped shape the business proposal that this year attracted a $450,000 IFC&#13;
   equity investment in newly launched Hagar Soya Ltd. and agreed to provide postinvestment marketing and sales support to Hagar&#13;
   as well. This financing will allow Hagar Soya to expand its daily output from 300 to as many as 12,000 liters per day. It will use&#13;
   locally grown soybeans to produce a nutritious drink that is affordable for Cambodia's poor and often malnourished population.&#13;
     MPDF has also helped Hagar Design, enabling it to obtain $65,000 in funding from IFC's SME Capacity Building&#13;
   Facility to improve its silk production operations. Hagar Design has established an international market and employs more than&#13;
   50 previously disadvantaged women to sew high-quality handbags, table mats, and other fabric products.&#13;

       Private Enterprise Partnership&#13;
       The Private Enterprise Partnership is IFC's technical assistance program in the former Soviet Union.&#13;

       and donor governments, which have provided a total                            small enterprises.This serves the partnership's objective to&#13;
       of $41 million from the partnership's founding in 2000                        build and strengthen the private sector and economic&#13;
       through the end of FY03. The partnership implements                           growth in these countries. The partnership's technical&#13;
       programs to build financial markets, link local companies                     assistance has facilitated $799 million in investment,&#13;

       LINKING SMALL BUSINESS&#13;
       TO A MAJOR INVESTMENT&#13;
       In the remote Magadan region of the Russian Far East, where&#13;
       IFC and its partners have invested in a gold mine, the Private&#13;
       Enterprise Partnership is ensuring that local small businesses&#13;
       share the benefits of industrial development. Through&#13;
       technical assistance, the partnership is helping these firms&#13;
       become reliable suppliers of goods and services to the mine.&#13;
         The Tauyskaya Dolina farm, located in Talon, a village of&#13;
       600 people isolated from other parts of the region, is an&#13;
       example of how the partnership can facilitate the process. The&#13;
       partnership helped the farm secure a contract with the mine,&#13;
       supplying 60 tons of potatoes in place of imports from the&#13;
       United States and other parts of Russia.&#13;
         As part of its ongoing commitment to small businesses in&#13;
       the region, the partnership is helping Tauyskaya Dolina&#13;
       strengthen its management and production practices and&#13;
       find new markets, such as the city of Magadan, which&#13;
       currently imports more than two-thirds of the potatoes for sale&#13;
       in stores. The partnership is also working with the farm to&#13;
       expand its vegetable production to include carrots, cabbage,&#13;
       beets, and greens for supplying workers in local mines.&#13;

Environmental and Social Facilities&#13;
As part of its focus on sustainability, during FY 2003 IFC established resources&#13;
that provide technical assistance and funding to help companies in specific&#13;
aspects of environmental and social development:&#13;
&#13;
· Corporate Citizenship Facility. This facility supports                 flexible financing to help overcome&#13;
  the development of good practice in community                          barriers to such projects and move them&#13;
  development, environmental stewardship, and labor                      toward commercial viability.Projects under&#13;
  standards.The facility also disseminates good practices and            consideration include a technology that&#13;
  helps IFC project clients take a more proactive approach               delivers small-scale, low-cost water&#13;
  to corporate social responsibility,beyond compliance with              purification and a venture to reduce liquid&#13;
  environmental and social requirements. Costs of the                    waste from pulp factories.&#13;
  programs are shared by the facility and client companies.           · Sustainable Financial Markets Facility. This facility&#13;
  The facility supported a conference in Latin America                   promotes environmentally and socially responsible lending&#13;
  where businesses advised each other on ways to achieve                 and investment,both through IFC's financial intermediaries&#13;
  sustainability and is working to improve supply chain                  and in the financial sector of emerging markets generally.&#13;
  practices in Ecuador's banana industry.                                Funded by grants, these programs include training&#13;
· Environmental Opportunities Facility. This facility                    and technical assistance to build financial institutions'&#13;
  supports projects that offer innovative private sector                 understanding of environmental and social issues and the&#13;
  solutions to local environmental issues. Such projects                 capacity to address them. Activities include expansion of&#13;
  produce goods or services that reduce pollution or                     sustainability training for financial institutions in Africa and&#13;
  improve the use of resources such as water and energy.                 support for the growth of socially responsible investment&#13;
  The facility provides funds for project development and                funds in emerging markets.&#13;

   SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM SAVING SPECIES&#13;
   As part of its commitment to preserving biodiversity in developing countries, IFC has launched innovative projects in Peru and&#13;
   Mongolia in partnership with local civil society organizations. The projects are funded by the Global Environment Facility.&#13;
     In the rainforests of Peru, IFC is working with two nongovernmental organizations to establish a ranching and export business&#13;
   for poison dart frogs. This will help rural communities generate income from a practice that enriches the rainforest rather than&#13;
   depleting its diversity. The project should stabilize or increase the population of at least 60 frog species, many of which have&#13;
   been smuggled out. It will also employ about 250 families and conserve more than 3,000 hectares of tropical forest.&#13;
     In northern Mongolia, IFC assisted in a river conservation project that will protect the Siberian salmon, a threatened fish species,&#13;
   and provide a sustainable source of income for local nomadic communities.The project contributes $1 million to help the Taiman&#13;
   Conservation Fund, a nongovernmental organization, develop a financially sustainable conservation management system for the&#13;
   Eg-Urr watershed. The plan allows for development of low-impact tourism in this wild and scenic waterway.&#13;

                hrough its Sustainability Initiative, IFC aims to ensure that environmental and&#13;
       T&#13;
                social benefits are at the center of economic growth.As part of the World Bank&#13;
       Group,IFC is committed to helping reduce poverty and to furthering concrete progress&#13;
       toward the Millennium Development Goals that the international community has set&#13;
       for achievement by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
       While IFC gives special priority to sectors with the broadest developmental impact,we&#13;
       pay attention to environmental and social issues in all of our investment and advisory&#13;
       work.We recognize that a social crisis such as hunger or HIV/AIDS cannot be ignored&#13;
       in countries where the economy needs to grow and where economic benefits need to&#13;
       be shared more broadly.We help our client companies become better neighbors to their&#13;
       communities and take seriously our own role as a neighbor and global citizen.&#13;
          Progress on the Sustainability Initiative is detailed in IFC's Sustainability Review,&#13;

          Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company operating in Angola, earmarked $1 million of&#13;
       a $280 million IFC loan to efforts to fight AIDS. IFC and Odebrecht launched an education,&#13;
       prevention, and care program targeted at the workforce and the communities of the company's&#13;
       Angolan operations, reaching some 30,000 people. The program trains educators and leaders&#13;
       at five sites to inform people about the risks of HIV. The program also places special&#13;
       emphasis on improving women's health and preventing transmission from mother to infant.&#13;
       It distributes male and female condoms, encourages confidential testing of workers and their&#13;
       families, provides treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and explains the company's&#13;
       protections for HIV-positive workers. The program stresses that no one is discriminated against&#13;
       for having contracted HIV/AIDS. Odebrecht helps these employees stay on the job as long as&#13;
       possible and provides assistance if they become too ill to work.&#13;
          The initiative is part of the IFC Against AIDS program. It shows how companies can&#13;
       protect their business while investing in the future of their workers and contributing to a&#13;
       developing country's overall AIDS strategy.&#13;

INTRODUCING DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE TO PRIVATE SECTOR WORK&#13;
A Chance to Work is an international program that helps disadvantaged people find work in the communities where the World&#13;
Bank Group and its private sector partners operate. The program provides six months of paid work and on-the-job training in&#13;
skills the private sector demands, after which participants enter the job market.&#13;
  Since its inception as a community outreach effort by IFC's Legal Department, A Chance to Work has helped disadvantaged&#13;
people find more than 100 jobs. Upon completing the program, participants have found steady work in offices, hotels,&#13;
assisted-living centers, law firms, beauty salons, retail stores, and other businesses. In Washington, D.C., outreach&#13;
participants are identified through community organizations and religious charities. These organizations provide support to&#13;
participants, including psychological counseling and tutoring to earn their high school diploma.&#13;
  In Cairo, participants have developed skills in plumbing and automotive bodywork through a pilot project. Participants&#13;
have found jobs to support themselves and their families as a result. The socially responsible employers who participate also&#13;
benefit from dedicated and motivated workers. The program in Cairo is administered by the LEAD Foundation, an Egyptian&#13;
nongovernmental organization supported by the local private sector and international donors. IFC provides technical assistance&#13;
to the foundation.&#13;
  An IFC team is also preparing a pilot project in Moscow.&#13;

      Improving Use of Resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             ocusing on sustainability makes good sense for business. IFC's current work in the&#13;
      F&#13;
             energy sector--with utilities, private companies, and financial institutions--&#13;
      provides examples of how innovative approaches to project finance can allow the&#13;
      private sector to achieve environmental benefits while enhancing profitability.&#13;
&#13;
      Our investments,for example,include projects that commercialize energy efficiency in&#13;
      several Central European countries (see box). IFC is also breaking new ground in the&#13;
      market for greenhouse gas emission reductions--also called carbon credits--together&#13;
      with government and private sector buyers of emission reductions and sponsors in&#13;
      developing countries (see box). Industrialized countries that ratify the Kyoto Protocol&#13;
      will be required, once it comes into force, to reduce emissions they produce&#13;
      domestically. These countries can also meet a part of their obligation by purchasing&#13;
      carbon credits from projects in developing countries.&#13;
        IFC supports this market-based approach through several World Bank Group&#13;
      facilities that purchase carbon credits.For developing countries,the sale of carbon credits&#13;
      will encourage the transfer of cleaner technologies at an effectively reduced cost. For&#13;
      developed countries,the purchase of credits increases the range of options for complying&#13;
      with the Kyoto Protocol. Use of a market-based system is a groundbreaking step for&#13;
      achieving environmentally beneficial impacts globally,and IFC is actively facilitating the&#13;
      development of this market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      COMMERCIALIZING ENERGY EFFICIENCY FINANCE&#13;
      Central European countries remain three to five times more inefficient in energy use than their Western European neighbors.&#13;
      This inefficiency impairs economic competitiveness, creates social pressures, causes air pollution, and poses obstacles to EU&#13;
      accession. The demand for new, energy-efficient technologies is strong, but there is little capital available. Local financial&#13;
      intermediaries consider energy efficiency projects high risk because of their novelty and the difficulty in structuring collateral.&#13;
        To promote such projects, IFC, in partnership with the Global Environment Facility, has established a $90 million guarantee&#13;
      facility, including up to $75 million invested by IFC. The facility provides a partial guarantee for loans made by local&#13;
      financial intermediaries when they invest in energy efficiency projects. This innovative structure will enable IFC to leverage&#13;
      more than $225 million in private capital investments. IFC implemented a pilot project in Hungary in 1997 and expanded&#13;
      the initiative to the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia in June 2002.&#13;
        The goal is to build a sustainable market for financing energy efficiency. The initiative uses a combination of technical&#13;
      assistance and credit enhancement instruments to enable local financial institutions to develop a profitable business in&#13;
      energy efficiency lending.&#13;
        This effort will have significant economic, environmental, and social benefits, and it supports the participating countries'&#13;
      targets for EU accession. Examples of program impacts in Hungary include investments in projects to upgrade street lighting&#13;
      in small towns in the poorest parts of the country and to replace outdated, unreliable heating technologies in hospitals.&#13;

MARKET MECHANISMS THAT REDUCE EMISSIONS&#13;
In addition to offering project financing, for eligible projects IFC can help companies increase their income while reducing&#13;
environmental impacts. For example, IFC recently committed $15 million in financing to Balrampur Chini Mills Limited, one of&#13;
India's premier sugar companies, to help finance a 20-megawatt cogeneration plant that will produce electricity from the biomass&#13;
waste product of its sugar operations. The IFC-Netherlands Carbon Facility is also negotiating to purchase up to 2 million tonnes&#13;
of emission reductions from their operations.&#13;
  Another example of combining conventional project financing and carbon financing to help companies lower costs and&#13;
increase efficiency is the El Canadá hydroelectric project in western Guatemala, which will displace about 144,000 tonnes&#13;
annually of greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be generated through thermal plants. In addition to $27 million in&#13;
financing (including a $12 million syndicated loan), IFC collaborated with the sponsors and the Prototype Carbon Fund to arrange&#13;
carbon credit financing.&#13;
  IFC is also promoting the market for greenhouse gas emission reductions by helping companies in which it is not investing&#13;
directly. This year the IFC-Netherlands facility struck a C15 million deal to purchase 5 million tonnes of emission reductions&#13;
                                                          =&#13;
&#13;
from V&amp;M do Brasil, a leading producer of steel tubes in Brazil that uses sustainably produced biomass charcoal instead of coal&#13;
in its steel production. Revenues from this sale of carbon credits will be used by the company to continue maintaining its biomass&#13;
plantations. IFC also facilitated a one-time sale of 400,000 tonnes of credits by V&amp;M to Toyota Tsusho Corporation of Japan.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      INVESTMENT PRODUCTS&#13;
&#13;
      Equity and Quasi-Equity&#13;
      IFC risks its own capital by buying shares in project companies, other project entities, financial institutions, and&#13;
      portfolio or private equity funds.We generally subscribe to between 5 and 20 percent of a project's equity.We will&#13;
      not normally hold more than a 35 percent stake or be the largest shareholder in a project.We are a long-term investor&#13;
      in our projects.When it comes time to sell, we prefer to exit by selling shares either in a trade sale or, if liquidity&#13;
      permits, in a capital market following a public offering.&#13;
        With quasi-equity instruments we invest through products that have both debt and equity characteristics. Some&#13;
      instruments,like subordinated loans and convertible debt,impose fixed-repayment schedules.Others,such as preferred&#13;
      stock and income notes, do not require such rigid repayment arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
      Loans and Intermediary Services&#13;
      We finance projects and companies through our A-loans, which are for IFC's own account. IFC cannot accept&#13;
      government guarantees.Maturities of A-loans generally range between 7 and 12 years at origination,but some loans&#13;
      have been extended to as long as 20 years.While most IFC loans are provided in major currencies,we are expanding&#13;
      our capacity to offer local currency loans.&#13;
        We carry out comprehensive due diligence before investing in any project. Because of our extensive lending&#13;
      experience in developing countries,we are uniquely qualified to evaluate the risks associated with projects.We are willing&#13;
      to extend loans that are repaid only from the cash flow of the project, with only limited recourse or without recourse&#13;
      to the sponsors.&#13;
        We also make loans to intermediary banks, leasing companies, and other financial institutions through credit lines&#13;
      that result in further on-lending.These credit lines are often targeted to small businesses.&#13;
&#13;
      Mobilization&#13;
      Mobilization of private sector financing in developing countries is fundamental to the fulfillment of IFC's role as a&#13;
      development catalyst.We broaden our impact by mobilizing loans from other financial institutions that are willing to&#13;
      participate with IFC in extending credit to clients in the emerging markets.&#13;
        Syndicated loans, or B-loans, are a key part of IFC's mobilization efforts. Through this mechanism, financial&#13;
      institutions share fully in the commercial credit risk of projects, while IFC remains the lender of record. Participants&#13;
      in IFC's loans share in the advantages that IFC derives as a multilateral development institution, including preferred&#13;
      access to foreign exchange. Where applicable, these participant banks are also exempted from the mandatory&#13;
      provisioning requirements that regulatory authorities may impose.&#13;
        In addition, IFC offers structured finance solutions to clients, including partial credit guarantees and securitizations.&#13;
      These enable clients to raise a significantly larger amount of capital than that represented by IFC's own exposure.&#13;
      This is especially important for mobilizing local currency funds in the domestic market from institutional investors and&#13;
      financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Guarantees and Risk Management&#13;
Guarantees on financial instruments and stand-by financing provide opportunities for IFC to extend credit in a manner that&#13;
helps clients access capital markets and gain borrowing flexibility.Products include credit guarantees on loans and bonds,trade&#13;
enhancement and forfaiting facilities, and loan facilities.&#13;
  IFC commonly provides partial credit guarantees on bonds and loans and,in limited circumstances,full credit guarantees on&#13;
local currency loans. Credit guarantees cover all credit risks during a specified portion of the financing term or up to a&#13;
specified capped amount and often serve to extend maturities beyond what private creditors would otherwise provide.&#13;
Guarantees in local currency support client needs while helping develop local financial markets. In the international bond&#13;
markets, a foreign currency partial credit guarantee helps an IFC client company diversify funding sources by establishing its&#13;
own credit with international investors.&#13;
  IFC offers partial credit guarantees on trade enhancement and forfaiting facilities.These facilities help partner banks expand&#13;
or extend trade financing programs for local importers and exporters when such programs are constrained by country limits&#13;
or other factors. Small and medium enterprises often benefit from these programs, since they otherwise would have limited&#13;
or high-cost access to trade finance. Loan facilities provide partial credit guarantees for general loan programs that serve small&#13;
and medium enterprises.Through such facilities, partner banks are able to expand or extend their lending programs to targeted&#13;
sectors in local or foreign currency.&#13;
  IFC's risk management products provide clients with access to long-term derivatives markets.Currency-hedging instruments&#13;
allow clients to hedge their foreign exchange exposures, typically related to foreign currency borrowings. With the&#13;
development of emerging market derivatives,IFC offers hedges into local currency where these markets exist.IFC also provides&#13;
derivative products to enable clients to manage their interest rate and commodity price risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OTHER SERVICES&#13;
&#13;
Advisory Services&#13;
IFC advisory services are designed to improve the investment climate in member countries and the business practices of&#13;
companies in which we invest.They play an increasingly important role in the way IFC approaches its investment activities.&#13;
  We undertake a wide array of financial market advisory assignments, specializing in securities markets and in banking and&#13;
credit institutions. Assignments address areas such as local debt market development and capacity building at financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
  The work of the Private Sector Advisory Services,jointly managed by IFC and theWorld Bank,covers policy issues,sector&#13;
advice, and specific transactions. Our activity in this area includes advice on competition policy, privatization structuring, and&#13;
policy analysis of foreign investment issues.&#13;
&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
Technical assistance further complements IFC's investment activities by offering advisory and training services to&#13;
governments and private companies. IFC manages special project development facilities that help small and medium&#13;
enterprises. IFC also manages the Technical Assistance Trust Funds program, which is supported by donor governments and&#13;
an allocation from IFC's own budget.These funds sponsor feasibility and sector studies,training initiatives,environmental and&#13;
social review of projects, and advisory assignments to governments.&#13;

           n FY 2003,more than 67 percent of our new investments were in our priority sectors&#13;
      I&#13;
           of finance,infrastructure,information technology,and health and education.The share&#13;
      of these investments in frontier countries,either high-risk or low-income,was 28 percent.&#13;
&#13;
      Overview&#13;
      IFC signed investment commitments of $5.03 billion for 204 projects in FY03,of which&#13;
      $1.18 billion were mobilized through loan syndications, compared with $3.61 billion in&#13;
      IFC commitments for FY02, of which $518 million were syndications. IFC provides a&#13;
      range of products and services for clients,including loans,equity,quasi-equity,guarantees,&#13;
      and risk management products that are funded through IFC's own financial resources. It&#13;
      also syndicates participations in its loans to international financial institutions. Of the $3.85&#13;
      billion investment commitments IFC signed for its own account, $344 million were for&#13;
      equity investments,$368 million were for quasi-equity investments,$2.60 billion were for&#13;
      loan agreements, $429 million were for guarantees, and $106 million were for risk&#13;
      management products. Based on the total project costs of our FY03 projects, each $1 in&#13;
      IFC commitments for our own account resulted in an additional $3.74 in funding from&#13;
      other sources.&#13;
         Our investment portfolio at June 30, 2003, included $16.8 billion for IFC's own&#13;
      account and $6.6 billion in syndicated loans held for others.We added 143 companies&#13;
      to our portfolio this year, and 156 companies left the portfolio. Five-year data on&#13;
      investment approvals, commitments, and disbursements appear on the opposite page.&#13;

      Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
                             SEEKING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      T       he global economic slowdown has had a less pronounced impact on Africa than&#13;
              on other regions. It has, however, depressed commodity prices for Africa's prin-&#13;
      cipal exports. While many prices stabilized in the past year, they have yet to recover.&#13;
      Slow growth of exports has been compounded by a decline in the tourism industry,&#13;
      which has been hard hit by the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks as well&#13;
      as by war in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        On the domestic front,long-standing conflicts inAngola and the Democratic Republic&#13;
      of Congo have shown some positive progress. But political crises continue to haunt two&#13;
      countries that formerly led the region in attracting private sector investment, Côte&#13;
      d'Ivoire and Zimbabwe.&#13;
        African governments have maintained prudent macroeconomic policies despite trade&#13;
      losses and other challenges.But even with these policies in place,the average growth rate&#13;
      in Sub-Saharan Africa is less than half what is needed to make significant inroads in&#13;
      reducing poverty. In real terms, GDP growth slowed from 3.2 percent in 2000 to 2.9&#13;
      percent in 2001 to 2.6 percent in 2002. In addition to declines in exports and tourism,&#13;
      severe droughts disrupted agricultural production in southern and eastern Africa.&#13;
      Agriculture remains the foundation of most African economies, supporting more than&#13;
      70 percent of the population and contributing an average of 30 percent of GDP.&#13;
        The New Partnership for African Development, an African initiative that promises to&#13;
      bring improved governance and economic development, progressed further during the&#13;
      year and will help attract new investment for key projects. African exports to the United&#13;
      States, excluding oil, increased by 10 percent for 2002.This growth, boosted by the free&#13;
      trade treatment available under the U.S.African Growth and Opportunity Act, demon-&#13;
      strates Africa's potential for expanding manufactured exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      IFC ACTIVITIES&#13;
      Despite a difficult economic and political environment, IFC maintained a strong pres-&#13;
      ence in the region, completing projects with significant development impact in&#13;
      particularly challenging countries and sectors.&#13;
        IFC supported leading investments in conflict-affected countries. In the&#13;
      Democratic Republic of Congo we funded expansion of the leading cellular&#13;
      telephone operator with a second round of financing. Our first postwar invest-&#13;
      ment in Angola,in a new microfinance bank,is expected to take place in the&#13;
      new fiscal year.&#13;

Teaming Up in Africa&#13;
This year IFC began working with the International Development Association, the World Bank's concessional lending arm, on a&#13;
major new initiative to support sustainable development of smaller businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa. Expected to launch in fiscal&#13;
2004, the program will unite the two World Bank Group institutions in a coordinated, multicountry approach, with initial efforts&#13;
in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Over a three- to four-year period, the program&#13;
will combine the resources of IDA, IFC, the Africa Project Development Facility, and other partners to focus on access to capital,&#13;
technical assistance and capacity building, and an improved environment for business.&#13;
  In Mali, for example, the program will complement the government's comprehensive agenda to enhance economic growth.&#13;
IDA and other donors have provided debt relief to support structural reforms, including expansion of a private sector composed&#13;
mainly of smaller businesses. The initiative will also help create a commercial microfinance institution in Mali, support APDF's&#13;
training work with the local bankers' association, and run a mentorship program for firms that receive financing. The West African&#13;
Enterprise Network and APDF will also work to improve the capacity of local business consultants, and IFC's Nigeria-based&#13;
microenterprise capacity-building program will expand into Mali. The efforts in Mali will build on a strong base started in FY03&#13;
with donor country support, including the basing in Bamako of a full-time IFC coordinator for small and medium enterprises.&#13;

   TANZANIA&#13;
   The Skies Are Opening through Privatization&#13;
   To improve service, attract investment and professional management, and develop Dar-es-Salaam as a hub for air service,&#13;
   the government of Tanzania recently privatized the national airline, Air Tanzania. With donor funding, IFC advised on the           ANZANIAT&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                               AIR&#13;
   transaction through the Private Sector Advisory Services and also played a key role during the privatization process, as the                   OF&#13;
&#13;
   airline was in financial difficulties and needed substantial restructuring before sale.                                                          TESY&#13;
&#13;
      South African Airways emerged as the winning bidder, paying $20 million for a 49 percent stake: $10 million                                       COUR&#13;
&#13;
   in cash to the government and $10 million as a capital injection into the airline. SAA shares the&#13;
   objective of building Dar-es-Salaam into a hub for regional and intercontinental air traffic.&#13;
      Carried out under a fully liberalized and competitive market structure, the transaction&#13;
   should bring tangible benefits to both customers and the government. In earlier work&#13;
   through the Africa Project Development Facility, IFC also assisted a pioneering&#13;
   private airline in Tanzania, Precision Air. In a bold move that will promote full&#13;
   liberalization and open skies, the aviation policy adopted by the government&#13;
   as part of the Air Tanzania transaction offers no market protection to the&#13;
   airline after privatization.&#13;

      East Asia and the Pacific&#13;
             IMPROVING THE CLIMATE FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      E      astAsia's recovery saw growth increase from 3.5 percent in 2001 to about 6 percent&#13;
             in 2002. But that recovery is being buffeted by a series of unexpected shocks--&#13;
      emanating from the Iraq crisis and the SARS outbreak in particular--creating new&#13;
      uncertainty for East Asia on the international and regional fronts.&#13;
&#13;
        Although China was at the epicenter of SARS, strong growth there is expected to&#13;
      continue.The growth of the private sector and the country's entry into theWorldTrade&#13;
      Organization are transforming the economy, but ongoing challenges include restruc-&#13;
      turing the financial sector and state-owned enterprises, improving corporate gover-&#13;
      nance,and raising environmental and social standards.InVietnam,an improving business&#13;
      environment and the recent trade agreement with the United States have propelled a&#13;
      surge in private investment and exports, creating the conditions for robust growth. In&#13;
      Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, economic recovery has also accelerated.The&#13;
      sustainability of this regional recovery is placed at risk, however, by the unfinished busi-&#13;
      ness of corporate and financial sector restructuring, and, in the case of Indonesia, by a&#13;
      challenging investment climate.&#13;
        IFC's strategic priorities in the region include helping to improve the investment&#13;
      climate, developing local financial markets, and expanding private provision of physical&#13;
      and social infrastructure. IFC is also helping domestic enterprises grow into global&#13;
      players,promoting corporate and financial sector restructuring,and--through its invest-&#13;
      ments and the four project development facilities it manages in the region--reaching&#13;
      out to small businesses.&#13;
        In fiscal 2003, we supported financial sector reform and development through our&#13;
      investments and advisory work. With Sacombank, IFC made its first investment in&#13;
      Vietnam's banking sector (see box).The investment will strengthen the bank's capital&#13;
      base; along with technical assistance, it will expand the bank's operational capabilities&#13;
      and help it become a well-managed commercial bank in line with international stan-&#13;
      dards and best practices. In China, our equity investment in Xi'an City Commercial&#13;
      Bank--our first for a financial institution in the western region--will help it&#13;
      become one of the area's leading banks, demonstrating IFC's support for a&#13;
      relatively underdeveloped part of the country.We also initiated a training&#13;
      program for commercial banks in China that will introduce international&#13;
      best practices in credit analysis and risk management.&#13;

   Building a Market for Nonperforming Loans&#13;
   The Chinese banking system has accumulated vast amounts of nonperforming loans through years of lending to unprofitable&#13;
   state-owned enterprises. The high level of such loans poses a threat to economic growth and stability. To support reform of the&#13;
   banking system, the Chinese government formed four asset management corporations in 1999 to take over, manage, and dispose&#13;
   of nonperforming loans. IFC provided $50 million in equity and debt financing to support the sale of a portfolio by Huarong,&#13;
   the largest of these corporations. IFC's participation enhanced the transparency of the process, encouraging foreign participa-&#13;
   tion and contributing to increased competition. This first-of-its-kind transaction, which created the first onshore international&#13;
   and domestic joint-venture vehicle for acquiring Chinese nonperforming loans, will provide much-needed momentum to the devel-&#13;
   opment of this market and set the standard for similar transactions.&#13;

     Helping an IT Company Expand&#13;
     Vietnam's recent trade agreement with the United States opens a large new market for high-technology exports, and the country&#13;
     is developing the skills it needs to compete. Recognizing that global companies are often reluctant to work with small startups,&#13;
     IFC has made a $1.75 million equity investment in Glass Egg, a digital media company in Ho Chi Minh City that produces soft-&#13;
     ware for computer and video games, contract programming, and 3-D animation. Our investment and other support will allow&#13;
     the company to expand, despite the global downturn in the technology sector and the limited supply of venture capital for&#13;
     Vietnamese companies. It will help Glass Egg open a business development office in the United States. It will also enhance&#13;
     the company's credibility and help secure additional contracts, while generating highly skilled software development jobs in&#13;
     Vietnam. By funding intensive training of new employees, it will also bring higher standards of software services to Vietnam and&#13;
     help the company build a broader international client base. This is IFC's second investment in Vietnam's information technology&#13;
     sector and demonstrates the World Bank Group's commitment to this sector in Vietnam.&#13;

    Privatization Improves Efficiency and Customer Service&#13;
    Building on earlier privatization advisory work, this year IFC extended financing for the capital investment program of Manila&#13;
    Water Company, a water and wastewater concessionaire operating in metropolitan Manila. The company's concession was awarded&#13;
    to address chronic problems in the water system, including low pressure, intermittent supply, and losses from leaks and unau-&#13;
    thorized connections. MWC has made steady improvements in operations, vastly expanding connections and reducing water&#13;
    losses. The project addresses the major development issue of access to clean water and sanitation services in the Philippines.&#13;
    It will reduce waterborne diseases through investments in water quality, lower the average purchase price of water, free up time&#13;
    otherwise spent on collecting and carrying water, and facilitate investment by companies in production processes that require&#13;
    reliable water supply or wastewater treatment. IFC participation demonstrates its support of water privatization when the priva-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
          n the global economic slowdown, South Asia has been a bright spot, sustaining&#13;
      I&#13;
          growth of around 5 percent. Growth has been led by the private sector, particularly&#13;
      the services sector in India, which is at the forefront of the growing global market in&#13;
      services. The region also continued to make strides in improving the international&#13;
      competitiveness of its industrial sector.&#13;
&#13;
         IFC has committed $386 million in new investments, syndicated $37 million in&#13;
      loans, and provided technical assistance to help companies restructure their operations,&#13;
      access longer-term funding, forge effective partnerships, adopt innovative technologies,&#13;
      and reach new markets.&#13;
        Among IFC's investments this year are a number of manufacturers seeking to achieve&#13;
      international competitiveness amid declining import tariffs. In India, these include a&#13;
      major automobile manufacturer, Telco; India's third-largest tire manufacturer, Apollo&#13;
      Tyres; Alok Industries; specialized steel wire and rope producer Usha Beltron; Cosmo&#13;
      Films, a producer of polypropylene film packaging; and construction and engineering&#13;
      group Larsen and Toubro. In Bangladesh, IFC helped R.A.K. Ceramics invest in new&#13;
      capacity to manufacture sanitary ware and ceramic tiles (see box).&#13;
        These companies are bringing new technologies to the South Asian market that are&#13;
      both more cost-effective and more environmentally friendly:radial tires that reduce fuel&#13;
      consumption, for example, and biodegradable packaging materials. IFC is also helping&#13;
      clients implement sustainable business practices. IFC advised Usha Beltron to set up a&#13;
      cogeneration plant that reduces emissions and saves money by generating power from&#13;
      the waste flue gases that its iron plant creates. IFC is also working with&#13;
      Usha Beltron to extend its community development programs in&#13;
      Bihar and Jharkhand, two of India's poorest states (see box). IFC is&#13;
      financing the production of natural gas from offshore fields in&#13;
      Gujarat state, which will improve the availability of cleaner,&#13;
      lower-cost power to industrial users and power generators.In&#13;
      the Maldives, IFC's loan to tourism and logistics company&#13;

INDIA&#13;
Helping Farmers through Farm Service Centers&#13;
Crop yields in India remain below their potential. Many seeds, chemicals, and fertilizers are of uncertain quality and sold with&#13;
insufficient guidance. Pesticides are often applied in a haphazard way, with little concern for risks to health and the environ-&#13;
ment. The reach of public extension services is limited.&#13;
  The country's largest manufacturer of tractors, Mahindra and Mahindra has a long relationship with the Indian farmer. It has&#13;
developed a model for commercially run farm service centers: one-stop shops for seeds, fertilizers, and chemicals; rental equip-&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                             JOSEPH&#13;
ment; market and agronomic information; farming advisory services; and assistance in obtaining crop finance from commer-&#13;
cial banks. This model is being established on a franchise basis across India, with IFC as a 28 percent equity partner&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                   LUDWINA&#13;
in the parent company, Mahindra Shubhlabh.&#13;
  IFC has helped develop a plan to improve the health of farmers and to protect the environment&#13;
from misuse of agricultural chemicals. This maintains crop-damaging pest populations below&#13;
the point of economic significance, instead of attempting to eradicate them. Chemical&#13;
pesticides are used only as a last resort. IFC also helped the company develop&#13;
a corporate pesticide policy and prepare a manual to assist each farm&#13;
service center in implementing it.&#13;
  The first centers opened in 2000. More than 50 are operating&#13;
today, and, supported by IFC financing, the number is expected&#13;
to reach 180 by 2006. If successful, the centers will not&#13;
only provide income and employment for franchisees&#13;
but also increase agricultural yields, reduce produc-&#13;
tion costs, and lessen dependency on chemical&#13;
pest control.&#13;

      The IT Industry Moves into Chip Design&#13;
      The Indian software industry has experienced tremendous growth, exceeding $12 billion in revenues last year. Software&#13;
      exports increased 30 percent during fiscal 2002 to reach $10 billion, despite the downturn in the global IT market. To&#13;
      remain competitive globally, however, the Indian IT industry needs to move into higher value-added products and services.&#13;
      NewPath Ventures takes an important step by launching several new companies in the technologically sophisticated field of&#13;
      semiconductor chip design and embedded software. It will use India's high skill base and lower cost structure to compete&#13;
      with more established international chip design companies. IFC invested $10 million in equity and has coinvestment rights&#13;
      for up to $10 million in equity and quasi-equity of selected subsidiary companies.&#13;
        Unlike a traditional venture capital fund, the company can pursue new business opportunities by drawing on the extensive&#13;
      background of its sponsors--nonresident Indian nationals based in Silicon Valley. These professionals have a world-class track&#13;
      record in the semiconductor design industry and bring the combination of high-level experience, skills, and relationships needed&#13;
      to make entry into this market a success.&#13;

                                          GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E     urope and Central Asia continue to implement reforms that improve the business&#13;
      climate, and this contributed to overall growth of 4.1 percent for 2002. For IFC,&#13;
investment opportunities have ranged from manufacturing to agribusiness, with&#13;
considerable emphasis on helping smaller businesses through the financial sector and&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
SOUTHERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA&#13;
Steady Progress in Building the Private Sector&#13;
IFC activity in Southern Europe and Central Asia reached $587 million in signed&#13;
commitments during fiscal 2003, a record high and a 54 percent increase from the&#13;
previous year. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, the region continued to&#13;
grow, mainly because of sustained momentum for reform in a number of countries.&#13;
As a result of an improving business environment, IFC expanded its activities in fron-&#13;
tier countries such as Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina,Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,&#13;
where the challenges include weak corporate practices,underdeveloped financial inter-&#13;
mediaries, and small markets.&#13;
  IFC priorities for the region emphasize the financial sector, small businesses, and&#13;
support for privatization.We continued to focus on investments that have a broad devel-&#13;
opment impact and reflect our commitment to responsible environmental and social&#13;
performance. An important example is the Pamir Energy project in Tajikistan, where&#13;
we collaborated with IDA and other partners (see box, p. 13). Through the Private&#13;
Enterprise Partnership and Southeast Europe Enterprise Development, IFC provided&#13;
technical support to small and medium enterprises in the region.&#13;

AZERBAIJAN&#13;
Helping Small Businesses Access Financing&#13;
For their enterprises to grow, Azerbaijani entrepreneurs need ongoing, reliable loans at affordable rates. IFC has invested in&#13;
Microfinance Bank Azerbaijan, the first commercial microfinance bank in the country. The bank provides credit&#13;
and other financial services on commercial terms to micro, small, and medium enterprises. IFC's&#13;
equity investment of $1.75 million promotes business growth, generates employment,&#13;
builds confidence in the banking sector, and introduces commercial microfi-&#13;
nance techniques to Azerbaijan. The project encourages creation of similar&#13;
institutions and extension into microfinance services by existing commer-&#13;
cial banks. It provides training for managers and employees that will&#13;
also be available to other local financial institutions. IFC's involve-&#13;
ment in MFBA will improve access to financial services for a&#13;
large and underserved group of low-income entrepreneurs,&#13;
whose businesses will generate employment in poor&#13;
communities.&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
Modernizing a Company with Important Economic Impact&#13;
IFC has lent $9.79 million to rehabilitate, modernize, and expand Fabrika Cementa Lukavac, a privatized cement production&#13;
facility in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project, one of the largest and most visible foreign direct investments in the country,&#13;
will help meet the country's need for cement to repair buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure damaged during the war.&#13;
           Modernization at Lukavac will lower production costs and enable the company to compete with imports, thus&#13;
                      contributing to foreign exchange savings. The project will result in better quality cement and more&#13;
                             competitive prices in the local market for construction materials. Lower building costs will in turn&#13;
                                    boost reconstruction of Bosnia's infrastructure and housing. The financial institutions in&#13;
                                          Bosnia and Herzegovina would not have been able to provide the sponsors with&#13;

assistance to the sector in Russia, where it had grown to a&#13;
$2.3 billion industry in 2002. This year the Private&#13;
Enterprise Partnership began technical assistance programs&#13;
in Azerbaijan and Georgia to improve legislation and&#13;
strengthen local expertise on leasing. The partnership also&#13;
contributed to leasing legislation in the Kyrgyz Republic,&#13;

   First Private Company to Finance Primary Agriculture&#13;
   The agricultural sector in Russia needs access to credit and modern technology, but local institutions have hesitated to invest&#13;
   in this high-risk market. To address this gap, IFC and its partners are each contributing $500,000 in equity and up to $5 million&#13;
   in loans to the new Agro-Industrial Finance Company. As the first private company to fund Russian primary agriculture, it will&#13;
   purchase modern equipment and lease it to farms that have long-term supply contracts with agroprocessors.&#13;
      This project stems from the Private Enterprise Partnership's technical assistance work with farms that supply milk to&#13;
   Campina, a Dutch dairy processor in the Moscow region. Campina operates a $50 million yogurt production plant, which&#13;
   IFC helped finance with a $9.3 million loan. With donor funding, the partnership advised the farms on modern production&#13;
   methods to increase the quality and quantity of milk and brokered long-term supply contracts with Campina. To reequip&#13;
   farms with modern technologies, the partnership structured $2.1 million in capital investment: $1.4 million from Campina&#13;
   and $700,000 from equipment suppliers. This work has resulted in a 34 percent increase in milk production overall and a&#13;
   78 percent increase in the share of first- and premium-class milk. It has boosted the farms' milk revenue by 60 percent&#13;
   and doubled the farmers' income.&#13;
      The new company extends this work to a greater number of client farms. It enhances IFC's efforts to make Russian farms compet-&#13;
   itive, reliable business partners and to integrate them with agroprocessors. Once the company is operational, the partnership will&#13;
   train local farmers in financial management and consult with them on agricultural management and technology issues.&#13;

    BELARUS&#13;
    What's in a Name? Entrepreneurs Find Out&#13;
    In Grodno, Belarus, local authorities licensed 86 individual entrepreneurs to set up trading booths along a city street. Licensing&#13;
    requirements included purchasing a particular type of booth priced at $1,500 each, about 15 times the monthly revenue of&#13;
    a small trader. After this initial investment, the city redefined the booths as "kiosks." The change in terminology meant an&#13;
    additional $300 fee for a new trading license and a new, time-consuming round of visits by government inspectors.&#13;
        The Grodno Club of Entrepreneurs, a business association mentored by IFC, organized a media campaign in the local press&#13;
    and successfully negotiated a resolution with the city. When authorities accepted the association's proposal to define the row&#13;
    of booths as a "mini-market," the name change allowed the entrepreneurs to resume their trade and even reduced their taxes&#13;
    by 11 percent. All the entrepreneurs joined the business association, where they are better positioned to protect their inter-&#13;
    ests in the future.&#13;
        The club in Grodno is one of the 18 business associations that IFC's Private Enterprise Partnership works with across Belarus&#13;
    to create strong local advocates and consultants for small and medium enterprises. This work has promoted business-friendly&#13;
    policies and equipped entrepreneurs with the skills they need to succeed in a country with a small and weak private sector.&#13;
    Since IFC began working with the Belarussian associations, their membership has increased by 60 percent and their client&#13;
    base has doubled.&#13;

Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
       LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
T       he LatinAmerica and Caribbean region experienced another challenging year.By&#13;
        mid-2002,Argentina's general economic activity had declined by an unprecedented&#13;
degree from the 2001 level. Election concerns and fears of contagion from Argentina&#13;
fueled bond and currency market volatility in Brazil.An economic crisis unfolded in&#13;
Uruguay, caused in part by liquidity problems for Argentine banks operating there.&#13;
&#13;
   Venezuela suffered a serious economic downturn stemming from internal political&#13;
issues.In Bolivia,Colombia,the Dominican Republic,and Jamaica,political or economic&#13;
issues hampered the performance of the private sector. In calendar years 2001 and 2002,&#13;
private debt flow to the region declined. This retreat of capital, combined with the&#13;
economic slowdown,affected even such investment-grade countries as Chile and Mexico.&#13;
   Underlying these difficulties is the region's vulnerability to external shocks,due to low&#13;
domestic savings and a small, undiversified export base.There is also popular discontent&#13;
with reforms that have not delivered expected improvements in living standards.The slow&#13;
recovery of the U.S.economy and the war in Iraq also made investors risk averse.Volatile&#13;
prices for oil and other commodities and stagnant tourism further contributed to a diffi-&#13;
cult economic environment.&#13;
   Opportunities also surfaced, however, as new leaders took office in a few countries,&#13;
including Bolivia,Brazil,Colombia,and Ecuador.Leaders worked toward implementing&#13;
reforms, reactivating growth, and reducing inequality in the distribution of wealth.&#13;
Investors have remained cautious, however, about returning to the region.&#13;

CHILE&#13;
Helping Education, the Community, and Investors&#13;
IFC's first investment in private education in Chile illustrates our potential for partnerships in this sector and highlights our&#13;
work in creating new financial instruments. A local currency bond issue supported by IFC will yield about $23 million equiva-&#13;
lent for expansion and modernization of a leading private university, Universidad Diego Portales. The university will provide addi-&#13;
tional space for increased student enrollment in new programs in medicine, engineering, and the humanities. The university is&#13;
working with the municipality of Santiago to create an urban campus fully integrated with the community and neighboring univer-&#13;
sities. The project includes restoration and renovation of several historic buildings to help preserve the rich cultural heritage&#13;
of the district.&#13;
  The transaction was also innovative as a financial instrument: it constituted the first future cash flow securitization in Chile&#13;
and the first by a Latin American university. IFC's partial guarantee of 30 percent of the bond issues not only introduced an&#13;
additional means of local currency financing for educational institutions but also helped expand the domestic capital market.&#13;
The instrument, developed to attract Chilean institutional investors such as pension fund administrators and insurance compa-&#13;
nies, provides a new asset class for investing their funds. With IFC's guarantee, the eight-year bonds received a higher rating&#13;
from local affiliates of the major rating agencies than they would have otherwise and were successfully placed.&#13;

risks from currency mismatches by accessing domestic&#13;
capital markets.&#13;
  The export sector particularly benefited from IFC&#13;

taking advantage of currency devaluation. IFC provided&#13;
pre-export financing to such agricultural export partners as&#13;
Molinos andVicentin in Argentina (see box). Amid Brazil's&#13;
liquidity crisis and a rapid decline in credit, IFC helped&#13;
leading Brazilian banks secure trade finance: since&#13;

ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL&#13;
Countering a Downturn&#13;
In this year of capital flight from Latin America and the Caribbean, IFC played a key countercyclical role. In collaboration&#13;
with international banks through our B-loan program, IFC provided critical trade financing to the region in FY03, most going&#13;
to Argentina and Brazil.&#13;
   In Argentina, IFC supplied pre-export finance facilities of $60 million each to Molinos and Vicentin, two leading Argentine&#13;
food producers and exporters. Each facility included a $30 million internationally syndicated loan, making urgently needed&#13;
working capital available in a difficult time. Each facility is secured by the companies' export contracts and is renewable annu-&#13;
ally for up to three years. The facilities are part of IFC's ongoing effort to help Argentina emerge from crisis; last year we estab-&#13;
lished a similar facility for another Argentine company, Aceitera General Deheza.&#13;
   In Brazil, IFC worked through financial intermediaries to provide trade financing to the export sector. We initiated a program&#13;
that expedited international funding to prominent Brazilian banks, the major players in the country's trade finance sector. This&#13;
effort, later joined by the Inter-American Development Bank, addressed substantial cutbacks of credit lines from international&#13;
banks to Brazilian borrowers in the first half of this fiscal year. It also complemented government programs to provide tempo-&#13;
rary, short-tenor liquidity to the country's trade finance markets. Many companies and a broad cross-section of Brazil's exporter&#13;
community benefited: international banks that would have had to cancel or shorten the term of their credit lines were able to&#13;
keep them open at longer maturities. The initiative has reinforced the ongoing improvement in Brazil's external accounts.&#13;
Facilities have been arranged for several leading domestic intermediaries in Brazil's trade finance markets, such as Unibanco,&#13;
Banco Itaú, BBA, and Bradesco, and have raised an aggregate amount of $740 million in international funding since September&#13;
2002. The syndications also stimulated interest in Brazil from international private sector financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN       53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         IFC has also invested in microfinance institutions across&#13;
      the region, including Microinvest in Brazil, Calpiá in El&#13;
      Salvador,and F.I.E. Fondo Financiero Privado and Caja Los&#13;
      Andes in Bolivia (see box). A number of small business&#13;
      support activities are being implemented through a part-&#13;
      nership with the clients and organizations that specialize in&#13;
      technical assistance for these enterprises.&#13;
         IFC continued to pioneer some of the most innovative&#13;
      transactions in the region's financial markets, notably&#13;
      private sector financing for a municipal project.IFC made&#13;
      a partial bond guarantee for a private Mexican trust issuing&#13;
      local peso-denominated bonds to finance a municipal&#13;
      water conservation project in Tlalnepantla (see p. 17).&#13;
      In Chile, IFC provided a partial guarantee for a local&#13;
      bond--the first future cash flow securitization in the&#13;
      country. Bond proceeds will go toward expanding and&#13;
      modernizing Universidad Diego Portales,a leading private&#13;
      university in Santiago (see box).&#13;
         IFC also facilitated "south-south" investments that&#13;
      encourage efficient resource mobilization within the region.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     HEDINGER&#13;
      Examples include IFC financing for Marcopolo,a Brazilian&#13;
      bus manufacturer that invested in its operations in Mexico,                                                                                            TTHIAS&#13;

      and IFC's regional lending to the Cuscatlan Group, which&#13;
      has a strong presence across Central America.                            IFC's investment in a fertilizer plant helps farmers in Bolivia.&#13;

      BRAZIL&#13;
      Combating Hunger and Poverty&#13;
      Although a decade of economic liberalization has given Brazil a better foundation for improving living standards, millions of people still&#13;
      live on less than $1 a day. The new administration of President Lula da Silva has launched Fome Zero (Zero Hunger), a major campaign&#13;
      to address social inequality, focusing on food security for poor people and calling for involvement of the private sector and civil society.&#13;
      IFC is supporting this campaign and rallying the country's private sector to participate.&#13;
         As a first step, the Brazilian government has allocated funds to supply 1.5 million of its neediest families with a monthly subsidy&#13;
      to buy food. For its part, IFC is granting $300,000 to the Ethos Institute, a nongovernmental organization, and the Polis Institute, a&#13;
      think tank. These Brazilian partners will create innovative links between businesses and the communities to be served by the Zero&#13;
      Hunger program.&#13;
         This IFC-supported project will set up a database to record the needs of more than 900 municipalities and the contributions being&#13;
      offered by corporate participants. Polis and Ethos will also set up a call center and a Web site where companies can receive informa-&#13;
      tion and be matched with local communities.&#13;
         IFC has many Brazilian clients with strong managerial experience and a commitment to social responsibility. With the expertise of&#13;
      its two local partners, IFC can help connect private sector resources with the needs of Brazil's poorest communities. This public-private&#13;
      partnership is an important element in advancing the Zero Hunger program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      T       his year has been a time of increased turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa&#13;
              region.The war in Iraq and the uncertainty leading up to it, the continued unrest&#13;
      in the West Bank and Gaza, and concerns about spillover effects have reduced the&#13;
      economic prospects in much of the region.Not surprisingly,the countries most affected&#13;
      are those closest to the conflicts; the sectors most affected are tourism and transport.&#13;
&#13;
        Nevertheless, each country in this diverse region, from Morocco to Pakistan, has its&#13;
      individual strengths and challenges.Many businesses in the region are still investing,and&#13;
      IFC has been active. In Pakistan, for example, economic growth has strengthened and&#13;
      IFC had a solid program during the year. In FY03, we committed 17 new investments&#13;
      in the region overall, for a total amount of $279 million.&#13;
        IFC's focus in the region reflected corporate objectives:frontier markets,high-impact&#13;
      sectors, small and medium enterprises, and sustainability. As its overarching goal, IFC&#13;
      seeks the greatest development impact resulting in a productive private sector.&#13;
        IFC's frontier market approach means a focus on investments and technical and advi-&#13;
      sory services with the greatest demonstration effect, leading the way for other investors.&#13;
      Frontier activity in the region in FY03 included the commitment of a loan for $1.51&#13;
      million to Al Ahlia Mineral Water, a bottled water investment inYemen. In Algeria, IFC&#13;
      committed a $35 million loan to Algerian Cement Company, the first cement plant in&#13;
      the private sector in that country, and a $25 million loan for Ispat Annaba, a privatized&#13;
      steel plant.In Pakistan,we invested in Dewan Salman Fibre Limited,the country's largest&#13;
      manufacturer of polyester fiber (see box).Development of an IFC program proceeded&#13;
      in Afghanistan and Iran, with commitments expected in the coming year.&#13;
        High-impact sectors include private sector infrastructure and the financial sector,&#13;
      both of which have large multiplier effects for the countries.IFC's help to govern-&#13;
      ments in the region, both in technical assistance and investment, is important, as&#13;
      both infrastructure and banking are often still under the control of the public&#13;
      sector. IFC advised on the privatization of the Faisalabad Electric Supply&#13;
      Company in Pakistan in FY03.Also in Pakistan, IFC committed&#13;
      $9.25 million in a loan and quasi-equity to Karachi&#13;
      Container Terminal, a port project (see box).&#13;

Support for small and medium enterprises is a key pillar of IFC's strategy in the Middle East and North Africa. As a part of&#13;
implementing that strategy, IFC, with the support of donors, launched North Africa Enterprise Development, the first small&#13;
business development facility in the region, with offices in Algiers, Cairo, and Rabat. With an expected core budget of up to&#13;
$20 million over five years, the facility will provide services aimed at increasing the capacity in the region to nurture small&#13;
and medium businesses. Focusing on four key initiatives, the facility will work toward improving the access of small busi-&#13;
nesses to finance; supporting intermediary organizations such as consulting firms, training institutions, and business asso-&#13;
ciations, which can in turn provide valuable services; strengthening value chain links between large firms and smaller&#13;
businesses; and improving the business environment. In Algeria, the facility will also make some direct support available for&#13;
small businesses.&#13;
  This work is very important, since most of the private sector firms are smaller businesses, employing a large proportion of&#13;
the workforce. While these enterprises are large in number, they have not realized their potential for benefiting the economy&#13;
or improving living standards. The new facility will help provide the tools to move small business to a higher level of opera-&#13;
tions and provide a foundation for their continued growth.&#13;

      Improving Port Operations in Karachi&#13;
      Because a well-functioning infrastructure system is fundamental to economic development and rising living standards, invest-&#13;
      ment in private infrastructure projects is a major focus for IFC. In the MENA region, IFC has invested in power, telecommunica-&#13;
      tions, and now transportation. IFC has committed $9.25 million to an investment in the Karachi Container Terminal, a project at&#13;
      the port of Karachi, where container traffic is increasing at over 7 percent a year. With 60 percent of Pakistan's international trade&#13;
      and 80 percent of container volume flowing through the port, operational improvements in the container terminal will lead to signif-&#13;
      icant efficiencies throughout the port system. Shipping lines, exporters, importers, and other users of the terminal facilities will&#13;
      all be able to benefit from these improvements for their own operations. Lower transport costs and better service will in turn&#13;
      encourage trade volume and contribute to the overall economic growth.&#13;
        Premier Mercantile Services, Ltd., of Pakistan is the sponsor of the project, which is estimated to cost $29.2 million.&#13;

    Helping a Major Company and Its Smaller Suppliers&#13;
    IFC has made a major investment in Dewan Salman Fibre Limited, Pakistan's largest producer of polyester fiber. The financing,&#13;
    which includes a $30 million loan, a $4 million convertible loan, and a $1 million investment in a preference share issue, will&#13;
    help the company expand its production capacity, refinance its existing debt, and fund its need for permanent working capital.&#13;
    Because Dewan supplies 45 percent of the polyester used by the local textile industry, this investment bolsters the competi-&#13;
    tiveness and long-term sustainability of the industry as a whole.&#13;
       The investment shows strong support for the corporate sector in Pakistan at a time when access to offshore funding for even&#13;
    the largest corporate borrowers has been tight. The preference share issue is the first in the Pakistani market and establishes&#13;
    an important new source of equity capital for major Pakistani companies. IFC's support will also encourage other local busi-&#13;
    ness groups to pursue refinancing opportunities to bolster their balance sheets and enhance their long-term financial sustain-&#13;
    ability. To extend benefits throughout the supply chain, Dewan is also contributing $2.8 million to a fund developed by IFC&#13;
    that will support investment and links with smaller businesses that supply the company with goods and services. This is the&#13;
    first such investment in Pakistan.&#13;

      MOBILIZATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
      Loan Syndications&#13;
      Volatile markets,slow growth worldwide,and the regional impact of the financial crisis&#13;
      in Argentina have reinforced the vital role IFC plays in mobilizing financing from the&#13;
      private sector.Investing in developing countries is the Corporation's main business,and&#13;
      the comfort of the IFC "umbrella"--preferred access to foreign exchange and exemp-&#13;
      tion from mandatory provisioning--is a key advantage for private lenders seeking to&#13;
      mitigate country risk.&#13;
        Signings of new B-loans in FY03 totaled $1.2 billion,compared with $518 million in&#13;
      FY02. Despite the challenging economic and political environment in Latin America,&#13;
      successes in large syndications in Brazil,Colombia,and the Dominican Republic demon-&#13;
      strate that bankers value the protection that IFC provides.We helped keep export credit&#13;
      lines open for leading Brazilian banks after international banks reduced their credit lines&#13;
      in late 2002. IFC mobilized $585 million in this major effort. In Argentina, by mobi-&#13;
      lizing pre-export finance for major food producers, we brought new money into the&#13;
      country and confirmed our willingness to support good clients through well-structured&#13;
      transactions. (For more on the facilities in Brazil and Argentina, see box, p. 53.)&#13;
        Syndicated financings signed in FY03 in Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Panama,&#13;

      for borrowers and will broaden our reach for sustainable devel-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ustainability is central to IFC's move to position itself as a&#13;
S&#13;
      supplier of broad commercial expertise,not merely capital,&#13;
to our private sector clients in the developing world. What&#13;
differentiates IFC is our ability to provide value to our clients&#13;
above and beyond financing. This value comes from the&#13;
expertise we have amassed over nearly half a century, from our&#13;
global scope, and from our unique capabilities--particularly&#13;
our expertise on environmental and social matters.&#13;
     For IFC,sustainability is an essential element of business success&#13;
as well as a means of achieving enhanced development impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
THE GLOBAL CONTEXT&#13;
&#13;
The past year brought into sharp relief several major challenges for sustainable&#13;
development in IFC's member nations.The global economy--facing a combination of&#13;
corporate governance scandals,overcapacity in key sectors,political instability,slowed trade&#13;
negotiations,SARS,and backlashes in some places against market liberalization--continued&#13;
to struggle to regain momentum from its steepest decline since the oil crisis of 1973.&#13;
  In this context, 2.5 to 3 billion people in developing countries continue to live on less&#13;
than $2 a day. Over the next 30 years, the world's population is expected to rise by an&#13;
additional 2 billion, with nearly all the increase occurring in developing countries.&#13;
To address this increase in population among other challenges, growth and innovative&#13;
approaches are essential.&#13;
  Together,these factors have placed private sector investment as an engine for economic&#13;
growth at the forefront of the poverty reduction agenda. But the World Summit on&#13;
Sustainable Development, held in September 2002 in Johannesburg, underscored the&#13;
sobering reality that the global growth needed in coming decades cannot be achieved using&#13;
the methods and models of the past.Throughout the developing world,clean water,clean&#13;
air, biodiversity, fisheries, and fertile soils are all at risk because of unsustainable growth.&#13;
  The challenges for a global development finance institution such as IFC have never been&#13;
greater.The need for our capital is clear, but so also is the need for IFC to pioneer the&#13;
creative solutions that will contribute to the sustainability of private sector activity in&#13;
emerging markets.&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                   SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW: SUMMARY  65&#13;

      ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITY                                             In 2002, IFC published its first Sustainability Review.&#13;
                                                                        It chronicled the early stages of development of our&#13;

      that a given country or sector presents viable investment&#13;

      Any new system that IFC devises to encourage performance&#13;

                 above the $161 million earned in FY02 and $241 million&#13;
       in FY01 (operating income excludes the effects of accounting&#13;
       standards for derivatives and hedging activities; including these&#13;
       effects, IFC's net income totaled $487 million in FY03).&#13;
       Operating income in FY03 comprised income of $205 million&#13;
       on the Corporation's client services operations compared to a&#13;
       $70 million operating loss in FY02 and income on treasury&#13;
       services of $323 million, after administrative expenses, above&#13;
       the $231 million treasury contribution in FY02. Overall, the&#13;
       Corporation's operating return on average net worth rose from&#13;
       2.7 percent in FY02 to 8.2 percent in FY03.&#13;
&#13;
       The return to profit on client services operations reflected stronger loan portfolio&#13;
       income and robust dividend income from the equity portfolio, complemented by a&#13;
       lower level of loss provisioning than in the previous year.The loan portfolio generated&#13;
       operating income of $219 million in FY03 (after charges for non-accruals, specific loss&#13;
       provisions, internal administrative expenses, borrowing costs, and loan hedging costs).&#13;
       This follows an operating loss of $139 million in FY02.&#13;
         The equity and quasi-equity portfolios--that is, the portfolios funded from net&#13;
       worth--recorded operating income of $125 million in FY03, above the operating&#13;
       income of $91 million in FY02. Dividend income was stable, totaling $143 million in&#13;
       FY03, up from $140 million in FY02.&#13;

At IFC our mandate is to further sustainable economic development&#13;
through the private sector.We pursue this goal through innovative solu-&#13;
tions to the challenges of development, as we invest in companies and&#13;
financial institutions in emerging markets and as we help build business&#13;
skills.We consider positive development impact an integral part of good&#13;
business, and we focus much of our effort on the countries with the&#13;
greatest need for investment. We recognize that economic growth is&#13;
sustainable only if it is environmentally and socially sound and helps&#13;
improve the quality of life for those living in developing countries.&#13;

            IFC's commitment

        <abstracts>
            This annual report reviews the oerations
            of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during fiscal
            year 2003. IFC's operating income for FY03 grew to $528
            million, more than triple the figure for FY02 and one of the
            highest on record. Its committed portfolio grew by 11.5
            percent to $16.8 billion. It was a year that emphasized
            coordination, and mutually reinforcing efforts among World
            Bank Group units, particularly in pursuing private sector
            development in client countries. The report stresses the
            need for support of IFC's priorities, including
            emerging, and frontier markets, technical assistance, and
            advisory services to help improve investment climates, and
            small and medium enterprises. Also underscored, is the
            significance of IFC's presence in difficult, country
            environments as a central component of its development
            mandate, while IFC's counter-cyclical role in the face
            of heightened investor uncertainty, and volatility of
            capital flows to developing countries, is recognized, as is
            the performance within the annual portfolio performance
            review, despite continued difficulty in the global economic
            environment. IFC's financial management is reviewed,
            and its leadership for protecting the Corporation's
            financial integrity, without compromising its development
            mandate, was commendable, though the need to maintain
            profitability, while increasing development impacts, is
            stressed. The report presents financial highlights,
            particularly outlining IFC's commitment to innovation,
            impact, and sustainability, and further identifies the
            period's operational, and regional outlook. The report
            also summarizes the financial and portfolio reviews, as well
            as technical assistance and advisory services during FY03.
