Financing Plan:            See Section V&#13;
Economic Analysis:         Microprojects financed by the TASIF will be selected according to&#13;
criteria described in the operational manual, integrating economic&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Map:                       IBRD 25721&#13;
Project ID Number:         TJ-PE 44202&#13;
Project Objective:         The development objective of the Project is to increase on a sustainable&#13;
basis the incomes of the poor and improve their access to essential&#13;
economic and social services. The Project objectives are to: (a) improve&#13;
incomes of about 250,000 poor people by 1999; and (b) develop local&#13;
capacity to implement participatory approaches to poverty alleviation.&#13;
Project Description:       The Project has two linked components:&#13;
(i)    The scaling-up of selected existing poverty alleviation programs&#13;
carried out by international non-government organizations. This&#13;
component has five sub-components: (a) the shelter and house&#13;
rehabilitation program (Save The Children-US); (b) the micro-&#13;
credit program (Save The Children-US); (c) the program of&#13;
support to female-headed households (Save The Children-UK);&#13;
(d) the agricultural reform program (Aga Khan Foundation); and&#13;
(e) future sponsored activities to be supported after the first year&#13;
of the Project.&#13;
(ii)    Development of the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund. This&#13;
component  has  two  sub-components:  (a)  institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
development of the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund as a&#13;
demand-driven funding mechanism to finance community-based&#13;
initiatives for small investments; and (b) financing of about 70&#13;
microprojects that support the rehabilitation or restoration of&#13;
small-scale social and economic infrastructure and services in&#13;
poor communities.&#13;
Project Benefits:           There are three types of benefits expected to be derived from the Project.&#13;
First, about five percent of the population will benefit directly either&#13;
from the scaled-up programs run by the selected non-government&#13;
organizations, or from the microprojects funded through the Tajikistan&#13;
Social Investment Fund. The benefits will vary across targeted groups,&#13;
including improved quality, availability or regularity of services,&#13;
increased family incomes through labor wages, reconstructed shelter,&#13;
improved supplies of agricultural inputs and services, and access to&#13;
financial services.&#13;
Second, the Project will strengthen in-country capacity to target, appraise&#13;
and monitor efforts to alleviate and reduce poverty. The strengthened&#13;
capacity will be manifested in the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund&#13;
which by Project end will be a demand-driven and cost-effective&#13;
mechanism to channel small amounts of money and provide technical&#13;
support to communities to plan and undertake small investments. This&#13;
mechanism will be used by the Government to attract increased external&#13;
funding for poverty alleviation, and infrastructure restoration and&#13;
development. Local governments, non-government organizations and&#13;
community-based organizations will gain valuable experience in planning&#13;
and undertaking small investments and poverty alleviation activities,&#13;
conducting competitive procurement, involving community members, and&#13;
reporting.&#13;
Third, lessons emerging from the Project will feed into the&#13;
Government's larger program of poverty alleviation in the future, and&#13;
will assist the Government in trying to mobilize increased external&#13;
funding.&#13;
Project Risks:              There are three main risks associated with the Project. First, the security&#13;
situation in much of the country is fragile, and there is still some fighting&#13;
in the East. To reduce this risk, the first component of the Project has&#13;
been designed to support the extension of poverty alleviation activities in&#13;
areas where programs are already successfully underway. Expansion or&#13;
replication of these or other programs and the microprojects financed by&#13;
the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund will be undertaken only where the&#13;
situation is sufficiently stable.&#13;
Second, political factors could compromise the autonomy, credibility and&#13;
effectiveness of the programs supported by the international non-&#13;
government organizations and the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund. The&#13;
risk to the former will be minirirzed through regular and close&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
cooperation between the non-government organizations and the Taj ikistan&#13;
Social Investment Fund staff. This cooperation will be facilitated by&#13;
technical assistance support. This risk will also be reduced by detailing&#13;
the specific roles and responsibilities of the Government and the&#13;
international NGOs in the service contracts, and by close monitoring of&#13;
the fulfillment of obligations through project management and regular&#13;
Bank supervision. To reduce the risk of interference in its daily&#13;
operations, the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund is being established as&#13;
a semi-autonomous body, with a Board of non-governmental and&#13;
governmental members and chaired by the Prime Minister. This&#13;
arrangement should create a high profile and broad ownership, and thus&#13;
help protect the integrity of the institution. There will also be&#13;
comprehensive institutional checks and balances, and efficient operating&#13;
procedures detailed in the operational manual, which will be checked&#13;
closely during project supervision.&#13;
Third, there are risks associated with the limited managerial, technical&#13;
and institutional capacity of local organizations responsible for proposing&#13;
and implementing microprojects, and for financing the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the microprojects after completion. To reduce these risks,&#13;
the appraisal procedures for the microprojects will include careful&#13;
analysis of institutional capacity, and technical assistance will be&#13;
provided to fill institutional, technical and management gaps.&#13;
Furthermore, increased community participation in the identification and&#13;
implementation of the microprojects will increase the likelihood that&#13;
microprojects respond to an urgent community need, thus increasing the&#13;
likelihood for sustaining investments.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY SETTING&#13;
A. Country Setting and Recent Developments&#13;
1.1    Tajikistan is a small country of 5.8 million people, with about seventy percent of the population&#13;
living in the rural areas. The economy is predominantly agricultural, even though only seven percent of&#13;
the land area is classified as suitable for agriculture. The agricultural sector, which under the Soviet&#13;
system was dominanted by cotton production, now accounts for 25 percent of Gross Domestic Product&#13;
(GDP) and 50 percent of employment. The industrial sector, which is dominated by aluminum&#13;
production, accounts for 35 percent of GDP and 12 percent of employment.&#13;
1.2    At independence in 1991, Tajikistan was the poorest republic of the Former Soviet Union (FSU)&#13;
and remains so today: its estimated per capita income in 1995 was $370. Poverty inherited from the FSU&#13;
was due largely to geographical factors. Prior to independence, most of the poor were located in the&#13;
remote eastern areas of the country, although there were pockets of severe poverty in other parts of the&#13;
country. Since independence, the nature and extent of poverty has changed--becoming more widespread&#13;
and intense--in large measure because of three major shocks, which also account for the decline in GDP.&#13;
First, the break-up of the FSU precipitated the collapse of inter-republic trade arrangements and brought&#13;
an end to the generous budget transfers that had long enabled Tajikistan to consume far more than it&#13;
produced. Second, the political and ethnic turmoil and conflict of the early 1990s resulted in the loss of&#13;
about 50,000 lives and disrupted economic activity. While turmoil continues in some parts of the country&#13;
especially in the South and East, recent progress in peace talks between government and the major&#13;
opposition groups indicate that the conflict may be near an end. Third, a series of natural disasters,&#13;
including floods in 1992, 1993 and 1996, damaged infrastructure and productive assets.&#13;
1.3    As a result of these factors production fell by about 60 percent between 1991 and 1995, affecting&#13;
agriculture and industry. Most industrial firms are currently operating below one-third of their capacity,&#13;
while agricultural production is only about 30 percent of its 1991 level. The real value of monthly wages&#13;
in 1995, when actually paid, was only about 5 percent of the 1990 level. Nearly one million workers&#13;
are either openly unemployed or under/partially unemployed.&#13;
1.4    The Government's reform program began in late 1995 and has been supported by an IMF&#13;
stand-by arrangement (May 1996), and IDA Credit in the form of a policy-based Agricultural Recovery&#13;
and Social Protection (ARSP) operation in an amount of SDR34.8 million, and the Institution Building&#13;
Technical Assistance (IBTA) Project for SDR3.4 million. Implementation of these programs was&#13;
satisfactory until late 1996 when renewed violence caused the Government to increase significantly its&#13;
defense expenditures. These were financed by a combination of budget arrears (including significant&#13;
amounts owed to the social safety net) and monetary expansion. The Fund's SBA expired at the end of&#13;
1996 and negotiations on a second SBA have not begun because of the Government's lack of response&#13;
to the Fund's advice regarding stabilization of monetary and fiscal indicators. Although the prior actions&#13;
for the ARSP Credit were front loaded, there has been some backsliding in recent months. Specifically,&#13;
although the Government agreed to liberalize cotton marketing by eliminating the state order system and&#13;
marketing monopoly, it has reneged on this understanding by imposing some export controls on cotton.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.5    On the political front, efforts are being made by the Government and the opposition to resolve&#13;
outstanding differences and bring the peace process to a satisfactory closure. Two weeks of difficult&#13;
talks between the Government and the United Tajik Opposition ended in Tehran in January 1997 with&#13;
the signing of a joint statement on procedural issues necessary to launch the transitional process towards&#13;
national reconciliation. In February 1997 meeting in Meshad, the Tajik Government agreed to a&#13;
power-sharing accord with the opposition group giving 13 seats of a new 26-member National&#13;
Commission for Reconciliation to each side. The two sides agreed that the Commission should be in&#13;
place and working by July 1997. Further agreements were also reached on a mutual amnesty law and&#13;
a central election commission and incorporation of opposition members in the Government. In March&#13;
1997, the two sides agreed on the reintegration of opposition troops into the regular Tajik armed forces.&#13;
The move towards peace has created hopes but also fears, as armed groups, who were left out of the&#13;
peace process, intensified the violence in the country. The taking of UN hostages in December 1996 and,&#13;
again, February 1997 is a clear manifestation of a fragile security situation in Tajikistan.&#13;
B. Living Conditions and the Social Situation&#13;
1.6    Living conditions vary around the country". Most industries are located in the northern oblast&#13;
of Khojand, which is widely believed to be better-off. Kulyab in the South has historically been quite&#13;
poor. The adjacent area of Kurgan-Tube has suffered some of the worst fighting in the conflict. The&#13;
eastern areas are remote and sparsely populated.&#13;
1.7    The fall in Government revenues and expenditures has led to a collapse of the inherited social&#13;
safety net. The combined share of GDP allocated to education and health was about 17 percent in 1992&#13;
but only 7 percent of a much smaller GDP in 1995. There has been a similar decline in resources&#13;
available for social payments, although the Government is now exploring ways of improving targeting&#13;
to those most in need. Recently the bread compensation payment and child allowance have been&#13;
combined into a single welfare payment. In addition to improved targeting, there is need for the&#13;
country's infrastructure to be strengthened to benefit the poorest groups and for new institutional&#13;
arrangements to be put in place to alleviate poverty.&#13;
1.8    A social assessment was undertaken in May-June 1996 in order to understand better the nature&#13;
and causes of poverty, its dynamics, and the context in which effective solutions could be developed. It&#13;
concluded that there are three main characteristics rendering certain areas liable to poverty: rural location,&#13;
impact of the war and isolation. Even though formal unemployment is severe in urban areas, and the&#13;
poverty of some urban households is no less deep than that of many rural ones, poverty is somewhat less&#13;
widespread in urban areas. Poverty is most acute in war affected villages, and in areas with a high&#13;
proportion of female-headed households, poor access to land, low levels of savings to act as a buffer&#13;
against hunger, a lack of means to cultivate cash crops, eroded assets (such as cattle and personal goods),&#13;
and shelter in a poor condition or lacking altogether because of destruction related to the war. Poverty&#13;
is also due to discrimination and lack of security inhibiting economic growth. Isolated villages have been&#13;
hit particularly hard. The main priorities arising from the social assessment are the following: peace,&#13;
1/ Administratively, in addition to the capital city of Dushanbe (population about 600,000), there are four&#13;
oblasts (or regions). These are: (i) Khojand (population about 1.6 million) in the north; (ii) Khatlon,&#13;
comprising Kurgan-Tube (population about 1.1 million) and Kulyab (population about 700,000), in the south-&#13;
west;(iii) Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (population 200,000) in the remote east of the country; and&#13;
(iv) the Regions of Republican Subordination (population about 1.2 million) in the center of the country which&#13;
are ruled directly and have no oblast level structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
security and the rule of law; an improved ability to meet basic needs of food, shelter, shoes, health and&#13;
education; diversification of income sources; and enhanced access to productive assets to increase self-&#13;
sufficiency and to produce tradeable goods. The social assessment (which is summarized in Annex F) also&#13;
provides strong support for using a participatory approach that will ensure effective targeting at the local&#13;
level, and identifies a wide range of local opportunities for microprojects. It indicates that effective&#13;
poverty alleviation will require careful attention to be paid to local aspects of ethnicity, gender relations,&#13;
physical security and power relations.&#13;
C. National and Local Institutions&#13;
1.9    The structure of the government of the Republic of Tajikistan consists of the executive branch,&#13;
the representative branch (the Majles Oli), and the judicial branch. The heads of the executive and&#13;
representative branches are appointed by the President of the Republic. They preside over the sessions&#13;
of the Majilises, prepare and submit local economic and social development programs for approval by&#13;
the Majilises, implement and account for these programs, and regulate land reforms. Since independence,&#13;
the government ministries have been reorganized on a number of occasions, which has added to&#13;
uncertainty and instability in public management and duplication of duties.&#13;
1.10  In December 1994, the "Law on Village Governance" was adopted, the starting point of reform&#13;
for local government. It replaced the former Village Soviets with Jamiats, which are groups of street,&#13;
block and village leaders. They propose program activities, control cash expenditures, consider issues on&#13;
territorial borders, and allot land for ownership or leasing. The Chairman of the Jamiat is responsible for&#13;
order, general improvement of the living conditions of the area, and land and property allocation.&#13;
Regional, town and farm representatives are appointed from above, and often are new arrivals from a&#13;
different region and/or sector. Other formal national institutions include the Women's Councils and&#13;
Youth League, but these are also highly centralized, hierarchical and top-down. Local level institutions&#13;
are mostly traditional, male dominated, and based on family relations or locality, and often have a&#13;
religious element. The extended family network is centered on the male head of household, his household&#13;
and that of his sons. The clan, which is based both on family and locality, includes the immediate&#13;
relatives of the male head of household.&#13;
1.11   Indigenous non-government organizations (NGOs) do exist, but with very limited capacity and&#13;
coverage (see Annex K). Only one local organization, the Pamir Relief and Development Organization,&#13;
supported by the Aga Khan Foundation, has much capacity. Most international NGOs entered Tajikistan&#13;
over the last three or four years, primarily in relief work and often in association with a multilateral&#13;
agency such as UNICEF or UNHCR. However, several of these have made the transition from relief&#13;
to rehabilitation or development work.&#13;
D. Government and IDA Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.12   The Government's reform program is designed to stabilize the economy and stimulate labor-&#13;
intensive economic growth. However, growth alone will not be sufficient to reduce poverty especially&#13;
in the near-term, given the precipitous fall of incomes combined with the collapse of inherited social&#13;
programs and the potentially high transitional social cost of the reform measures. The Government&#13;
recognizes that Tajikistan cannot afford to maintain the level of social investment and protection that it&#13;
enjoyed under the Soviet system, and is trying to achieve a balance between the need for social assistance&#13;
in the form of a safety net and the need to operate within a severely constrained budget. To do this, it&#13;
is making efforts to improve the efficiency and targeting of social programs, and to find innovative ways&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
to reach and support the poor.&#13;
1.13   The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tajikistan was discussed by the Board&#13;
on May 16, 1996. Recognizing the risks associated with the political and economic instability in&#13;
Tajikistan, the CAS calls for a flexible approach to the Bank Group's assistance program until the end&#13;
of FY97. It aims at arresting the intensification of poverty through measures designed to foster a supply&#13;
response, based on employment intensive growth combined with direct steps to protect the most&#13;
vulnerable groups. The broad elements of the strategy are to: (a) strengthen institutional capacity to plan&#13;
and implement a medium-term program of structural reform; (b) support the Government's efforts to&#13;
stabilize the economy; and (c) moderate the impact of the economic collapse on vulnerable groups. Under&#13;
this approach the Bank will continue supporting the implementation of the IBTA and the ARSP Credits,&#13;
provided the security situation remains satisfactory. In addition to the proposed Pilot Poverty Alleviation&#13;
Project (PPAP), the Bank Group will also begin preparation of an adjustment credit, provided an IMF&#13;
program remains in place. The Bank has been coordinating closely with other donors in Tajikistan,&#13;
particularly the EBRD, EU, UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, Aga Khan Foundation, and USAID. Until now,&#13;
donors have mainly provided technical support and/or humanitarian assistance, while little support has&#13;
gone to development projects.&#13;
1.14   Within this overall country approach, the strategy for the proposed PPAP is based on: (a) the&#13;
urgent need to address the poverty problem directly, to revive economic activity at the local level and&#13;
to get some productive incomes into poor households; (b) the lack of services and the considerable&#13;
backlog of maintenance which needs to be carried out on the country's basic infrastructure; (c) the&#13;
existence of some implementation capacity and development program experience among the international&#13;
NGO community active in the country; (d) recognition of the weak institutional capacity of the&#13;
Government at present, and the highly constrained Government budget envelope which prevents more&#13;
than a marginal impact on the poor even with improved targeting; (e) the importance of building upon&#13;
the coping and survival strategies which are now being adopted by the people themselves; (f) the need&#13;
to create indigenous capacity for carrying out poverty-focussed development programs; and (g) the&#13;
relatively limited operational experience so far of both the Bank Group and other donors in Tajikistan.&#13;
1.15   This calls for a strategy with a dual approach: (a) support for the scaling-up and replication (over&#13;
a three-year period) of a few selected programs currently operated by international NGOs which already&#13;
have significant poverty alleviation impact; and (b) the building up of national capacity for designing,&#13;
carrying out, and evaluating community-based projects through the establishment of a social investment&#13;
fund and associated institutional development activities. In this way, it is hoped that there will be an&#13;
immediate and positive impact on the living standards of some poor people in the country. The creation&#13;
of a new mechanism and successful financing of projects will also increase the likelihood of additional&#13;
funding in the future.  With procedures developed for the identification and implementation of&#13;
microprojects, and with the staff in place, the scope and infrastructure for a larger program will exist.&#13;
A follow-up project has already been provisionally included in the Bank's lending program for Tajikistan,&#13;
and support from other donor organizations could be sought at forthcoming consultative group meetings.&#13;
Experience gained by the social investment fund in alleviating poverty through interventions in various&#13;
different sectors could also be extended through programs of assistance to individual sectors such as&#13;
agricultural development, health, education, roads and microcredit.&#13;
F. Lessons of Experience&#13;
1.16  It is important to consider the lessons of experience from three angles: (a) the experience of the&#13;
Bank so far in Tajikistan and other countries of Central Asia; (b) the experience of the Bank in working&#13;
with NGOs; and (c) the experience of the Bank in social investment fund projects in other countries.&#13;
(a)    The Bank's experience in working in Tajikistan is limited, so it is prudent to draw on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
experiences in Central Asia generally. Some of the main lessons include the following:&#13;
(i) high-level support and political commitment for key policy reforms and project design&#13;
are essential; (ii) the institutional reform of inherited social safety nets takes time to&#13;
achieve and tends to be undermined by the severity of the fiscal collapse; and (iii) staff&#13;
development and training, including on Bank-related procedures, are needed for efficient&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
(b)    In working with NGOs, the Bank has learned that: (i) partners need to be chosen&#13;
carefully, using a transparent and fair selection process; (ii) Government/NG0 relations&#13;
need to be addressed and specific agreement on any new operating modalities reached;&#13;
(iii) the managerial and technical absorptive capacity of NGOs needs to be realistically&#13;
assessed; and (iv) close attention should be given to the design of suitable procurement&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
(c)    General lessons emerging from social investment funds around the world include: (i)&#13;
objectives should be clear and based on community involvement; (ii) institutional&#13;
arrangements for project implementation should be designed to avoid bureaucratic&#13;
procedures, but coordination with line ministries is also important; (iii) well-qualified,&#13;
professional staff with performance incentives are necessary; (iv) there should be an&#13;
incremental approach, building upon and scaling-up existing activities; and (v) great&#13;
attention is needed to operational maintenance.&#13;
G. Project Preparation&#13;
1.17   Project design work commenced in April 1996. Project preparation was enhanced by several&#13;
factors and events: (a) a Working Group was established by the Prime Minister (and chaired by an official&#13;
in his Office) to guide the process; (b) two study tours were undertaken by members of the Working&#13;
Group to review the experience of social investment fund projects in other transition countries; (c) a&#13;
seminar was held under the auspices of the Economic Development Institute for participants to learn more&#13;
about the worldwide experiences of social investment funds; (d) a Japanese PHRD grant was approved&#13;
to cover some of the costs of the technical assistance and training activities for project preparation; (e)&#13;
particular use was made of national consultants, especially for conducting the social assessment and&#13;
poverty ranking exercises, and for examining legal issues; (f) there were extensive discussions with key&#13;
stakeholders (including the NGOs in the country) about the objectives and strategies of the project; and&#13;
(g) efforts were made to strengthen the working relationships between the NGOs and the Government.&#13;
In addition, there was close coordination with other external agencies. This included participation by the&#13;
UNHCR on the identification mission, and a USAID-funded consultant on the pre-appraisal mission.&#13;
There was also close coordination with the UNDP, especially regarding the development of its new&#13;
rehabilitation program, and with the European Union's TACIS Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
A. Project Concept and Objectives&#13;
2.1    The development objective of the Project is to increase on a sustainable basis the incomes of the&#13;
poor, and improve their access to essential economic and social services. The Project objectives are to:&#13;
(a) have a modest though quick impact (within three years from Project start-up) on the incomes of some&#13;
of the poor; and (b) develop capacity at the national and local level to implement participatory approaches&#13;
to poverty alleviation. The rationale for the Project lies in the severity of poverty and the emergency&#13;
situation in the country. Some insight into poverty was gained through World Bank economic reports and&#13;
the recent social assessment. Further information and quantification will be obtained through a&#13;
forthcoming poverty assessment.&#13;
2.2    The strategy of the Project is to: (a) collaborate closely with selected international NGOs that are&#13;
implementing programs in Tajikistan which could be expanded with additional funding quickly (an&#13;
approach which has the commitment of the Government); (b) maintain the momentum from the relief&#13;
phase and ensure continuity from humanitarian assistance to sustainable development; (c) use the Project&#13;
as a short-to medium-term program to reverse the deterioration in infrastructure and living standards, and&#13;
to stimulate some employment; (d) capitalize on the availability of some highly motivated and well&#13;
educated nationals wanting to improve social conditions; and (e) demonstrate successful poverty&#13;
alleviation programs for further replication and build institutional capacity for poverty alleviation activities&#13;
in the long-term.  In relation to the civil strife and emergency situation in the country, the strategy is&#13;
to (a) complement the emerging peace process with investments to reduce suffering and economic&#13;
hardships; (b) target poor communities, but also maintain an appropriate ethnic and regional balance; (c)&#13;
select Project staff and other collaborators on merit, but additionally, ensure that they are as&#13;
representative as possible of the whole national scene; and (d) promote cooperation between different&#13;
organizations and social groups, including the Government, local and international NGO's, academic&#13;
institutions and researchers.&#13;
2.3     The strategy will be implemented through two components: the scaling-up of selected existing&#13;
poverty alleviation programs carried out by international NGOs, and the creation of the Tajikistan Social&#13;
Investment Fund (TASIF). The strategy of the Project is reflected in the criteria used for selecting the&#13;
NGO programs under the first component: (a) targeting of the poor; (b) the developmental (rather than&#13;
relief) nature of the programs; (c) sustainability; (d) community participation; (e) the existence of ongoing&#13;
(rather than planned) activities; (f) management capacity to scale up the programs; (g) technical soundness&#13;
of the activities; (h) cost-effectiveness; and (i) environmental impact.  Although the choice of NGO&#13;
programs for scaling up was constrained by the existence and location of the initial programs, and&#13;
although the programs maintain a bias towards those areas of the country which suffered most in the civil&#13;
war, nevertheless, a significant number of different districts will benefit - including in the most remote,&#13;
eastern part of the country. Risks remain that some of the investments made could be undermined or&#13;
destroyed by a resumption of violence, but on balance, it is believed that the investments are likely to&#13;
contribute to improvement of tensions rather than the reverse. For example, different ethnic groups will&#13;
combine together in the house rehabilitation program, and efforts will be made in each of the programs&#13;
to train officials and other interested parties in design techniques which could then be replicated&#13;
elsewhere. In the second component of the Project, there will also be careful attention given to ensure&#13;
that social cohesion is supported through the microprojects&#13;
2.4    There are also critical links between the two components. The scaled-up NGO programs will&#13;
improve the situation of some of the poor, build some local capacity, and demonstrate poverty alleviation&#13;
activities that could be replicated or expanded through the TASIF. Community based organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
involved in the NGO programs will also be encouraged to put forward proposals to the TASIF. Similarly,&#13;
activities of the TASIF will involve the active participation of communities and collaboration with&#13;
"requesting agencies," many of which will be international and local NGOs. The TASIF will benefit from&#13;
lessons emanating from the NGOs' approaches to targeting poor groups, working with different types of&#13;
community organizations, and ensuring commitment to operation and maintenance. The linkages between&#13;
the two components will be formalized through TASIF's monitoring, supervising and reporting on the&#13;
NGO programs, as well as on the microprojects.&#13;
2.5   The Government has demonstrated its commitment to the proposed Project in a number of ways.&#13;
It quickly established the Working Group (composed of non-governmental and governmental officials)&#13;
which proved to be an efficient and valuable counterpart for Project preparation. The Prime Minister&#13;
agreed to be the Chairman of the TASIF "Board for Project Realization", and the Government agreed&#13;
to pass on borrowed IDA funds to the selected international NGOs on grant terms, in recognition of their&#13;
existing capacity to implement programs effectively.&#13;
B. Income Generation&#13;
2.6   The Project's first objective will be achieved mainly through the first component of the Project:&#13;
the scaling-up of selected existing poverty alleviation programs carried out by international NGOs. This&#13;
component has five sub-components:&#13;
(a)    The Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program (to be carried out by Save The Children&#13;
Federation (US): SCF-US) will assist 2,000 poor and previously displaced families in five&#13;
districts through self-help reconstruction of their homes devastated by the civil war.&#13;
(b)    The Micro-Credit (Group Guarantee Loans and Savings) Program (to be carried out by&#13;
Save The Children Federation (US) SCF-US) will provide access to credit and mobilize&#13;
savings for 3,750 poor women in the Bokhtar, Vakhsh, Vose, Kurgan-Tube and&#13;
Kolkhozabad districts of Khatlon Oblast.&#13;
(c)    The Program of Support to Female-Headed Households (to be carried out by Save The&#13;
Children Fund (UK): SCF-UK) will support a total of 3,700 female-headed households&#13;
and their communities: 2,100 of them in Vakhsh, and 1,600 in four other districts. It will&#13;
also strengthen their capacity to maintain and prevent the collapse of locally available&#13;
social services.&#13;
(d)    The Agricultural Reform Program (to be carried out by the Aga Khan Foundation: AKF)&#13;
will expand the area under food crop production in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous&#13;
Oblast (GBAO); increase food crop production and productivity in GBAO; establish and&#13;
support private farm management; and develop human and institutional capacity in the&#13;
agricultural sector in the oblast.&#13;
(e)    The future sponsored activities will be directed at further NGO and other programs that&#13;
meet the set criteria and will be implemented during the second year of the project.&#13;
2.7   The 70 microprojects to be funded under the second component of the Project, through the&#13;
TASIF, will also contribute to poverty alleviation, as they will be selected largely on factors relating to&#13;
their expected positive impact on vulnerable and poor groups. Their immediate impact will be modest due&#13;
to the relatively small number of microprojects to be implemented and the limited capacity initially of the&#13;
TASIF to target. However, by Project completion, the TASIF will be capable of channeling new funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
to many more poor communities.&#13;
2.8    For the first objective of the Project, there will be two sets of indicators to monitor progress and&#13;
evaluate outcomes. First, there will be a common set of five indicators which will be used across all of&#13;
the sponsored international NGO programs and also the microprojects. In view of the difficulties of&#13;
measuring income levels of the poor directly, three of these indicators will relate to proxy measures (food&#13;
security and nutrition levels; clothing and shoes; and availability of shelter and fuel). The other two&#13;
comnu-on indicators will relate to the cost-effectiveness of the programs and the extent of community&#13;
participation. Then, in addition, each of the individual NGO programs and also the microprojects will&#13;
have three further indicators relating to the specific programs. More details of these and the evaluation&#13;
procedures are given in Annex L.&#13;
C. Development of Local Capacity for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
2.9    The Project will strengthen in-country capacity to target, appraise, implement and monitor poverty&#13;
alleviation programs. This will be done in two ways. First, the Project will establish the TASIF as a&#13;
semi-autonomous, transparent, accountable and efficiently-run organization, able to fund an increasing&#13;
number of microprojects. The TASIF will also provide technical support to national and local&#13;
governments, community-based organizations and local contractors and entrepreneurs to conduct and&#13;
participate in competitive procurement. Second, the Project will encourage collaboration and capacity&#13;
building between international NGOs (especially those involved in the first component) and local&#13;
governments and communities to initiate and supervise poverty alleviation activities. For example, the&#13;
AKF will collaborate with the Pamir Relief and Development Program (PRDP), a national NGO, carrying&#13;
out the agricultural reform program. SCF-US will also seek to transfer the micro-credit program to a&#13;
formal, independent, local NGO or financial services institution, capable of carrying on or expanding&#13;
credit activities after the Project ends.&#13;
2.10   The proposed Project is a pilot, even though the first component finances the scaling-up of&#13;
already existing programs. It will demonstrate successful programs that can be further expanded and&#13;
replicated in other parts of the country through the TASIF or via other means. The Project will enable&#13;
experimentation to take place in terms of approaches to targeting, working with different types of&#13;
community organizations, in a variety of settings, and mobilizing community contributions for&#13;
investments and preventive maintenance. This experimentation will demonstrate the benefits and&#13;
limitations of various approaches, which will be adapted by the TASIF, government bodies, NGOs and&#13;
other actors.&#13;
2.11   The indicators to be used to measure and evaluate the success in building capacity will comprise:&#13;
(i) the development of national and local capacity to implement participatory poverty alleviation programs;&#13;
(ii) specifically, the number of TASIF staff trained in project identification, proposal preparation and&#13;
community participation; and also (iii) the number of national and local goverrnent officials trained in&#13;
these skills. Further details are given in Annex L.&#13;
&#13;

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1    The Project has two components: (a) scaling-up of on-going NGO poverty alleviation programs;&#13;
and (b) the development of the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund.&#13;
A. Scaling up of Poverty Alleviation Programs (US$ 7.5 million)&#13;
3.2    This component has five sub-components: (a) the shelter and house rehabilitation program (SCF-&#13;
US); (b) the micro-credit program (SCF-US)); (c) the program of support to female-headed households&#13;
(SC-UK); (d) the agricultural reform program (AKF); and (e) future sponsored activities to be supported&#13;
after the first year.&#13;
3.3    Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program (US$3.2 million).  This program will assist 2,000&#13;
returned families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes in five districts most devastated by the&#13;
recent civil war in Bokhtar, Vakhsh, Kolkhozabad, Kabodien and Shaartuz districts in the Khatlon Oblast.&#13;
The social assessment in this area identified the provision of shelter as a critical priority need for poverty&#13;
alleviation, economic recovery and the health and productivity of the population, and recommended that&#13;
the existing program ought to be scaled up to increase its impact. The Project will support essential&#13;
structural repairs (walls and roofs) through provision of essential roofing materials (timber, nails, tiles),&#13;
and through the distribution of food for work to local work brigades, including home owners. Local&#13;
project organizers will target the neediest families with local participation, and local communities will&#13;
assist in the construction, monitoring and distribution of food and materials. Documentation, training&#13;
and extension will enable replication in other parts of the country.&#13;
3.4    Micro-Credit (Group Guarantee Loans and Savings) Program (US$1.0 million). This program&#13;
involves the expansion of the existing pilot micro-credit program in Kurgan-Tube town, Bokhtar, Vakhsh&#13;
and Kolkhozabad districts of Kurgan Tube. The social assessment identified this region in terms of&#13;
opportunities and resources through access to markets, widely available irrigation and remittances, all&#13;
ideal conditions for micro finance development. Most of the 528 current women clients are urban or&#13;
semi urban and borrow for trading activities. The Project, in addition to supporting expansion of its&#13;
activities in the existing locations, will extend the program to the Vose District. Savings will be&#13;
introduced as an important component of this expanded program. The program will provide access to&#13;
credit and mobilize savings for 3,750 poor women. The management of the existing groups will be&#13;
restructured into an independent local NGO or financial services institution that could operate a micro&#13;
finance program independently to sustain poor women's access to credit. Tajik staff of the program will&#13;
be trained in the theory and practice of group guaranteed loans and savings programs. The Project will&#13;
support the expansion of the GGLS program through strengthening of GGLS at the institutional, financial&#13;
and client levels. At the financial level, the project will support a loan fund of US$ 300,000; the&#13;
training of staff in financial management; and a management information system (MIS). At the&#13;
institutional level, the project will support the formation and training of 250 groups of women clients (18-&#13;
20 women in each group) for borrowing and savings; recruitment of additional staff and their training&#13;
in financial management, group formation and institution building; collection of baseline data on clients;&#13;
and the setting up of an MIS system for efficient financial record keeping and monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
3.5    The Program of Su=port to Female-Headed Households (US$ 1.0 million).  This program&#13;
involves the provision of agricultural assets and strengthening of capacity of social services to provide&#13;
female-headed households (FHHs) with access to and ownership of agricultural assets such as livestock,&#13;
seed and tools as well as technical advice. SCF-UK's experience is that this approach can work provided&#13;
there is adequate consultation with beneficiaries about the scale of assistance and the nature of assets to&#13;
be provided. The program also includes informing clients of their legal rights, existing social services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
and assistance programs. Baseline data collected by SCF-UK for analysis of the cost effectiveness and&#13;
benefits of the project activities will enable not only the measurement of the overall economic benefits&#13;
provided but an analysis of household income overtime. The Project will provide inputs to 2,100 FHHs&#13;
in Vakhsh District, such as livestock, seed, tools, technical advice; start-up grants to day care centers and&#13;
schools; and the recruitment and training of additional field staff for group formation. It also includes&#13;
local capacity building activities and the replication of the SCF-UK model to 16 additional communities&#13;
of 1,600 households in Aini, Panjkent, Dushanbe and Shaartuz. Altogether, 3,700 FHHs will be reached.&#13;
3.6    Agricultural Reform Program (US$0.6 million): This program will be implemented by the Pamir&#13;
Relief and Development Program in conjunction with AKF in GBAO, the mountainous region of eastern&#13;
Tajikistan. Since its inception in 1993, the program's long-term goal has been the establishment of self-&#13;
sufficiency in staple food crops (wheat, potatoes, etc.) by the local populace. The Project will continue&#13;
to expand the area under food crop production, increase food crop production and productivity, establish&#13;
and support private farm management, and develop human and institutional capacity in agriculture. It is&#13;
planned that some 1,600 farmers will participate in the construction of irrigation channels and the&#13;
development of new land in six of GBAO's seven districts. The construction of 32 irrigation schemes&#13;
(108 kilometers of channels) will enable an increase in the amount of privately managed land by some&#13;
3,900 hectares. The specific PRDP-related agricultural reform processes in the area of farm restructuring&#13;
which are occurring in GBAO are consistent with the Government's land reform and farm restructuring&#13;
program that is currently being implemented on a pilot basis in other parts of the country and is supported&#13;
by the ARSP. Under the program, farmers obtain plots of land for private management from kolkhoz&#13;
(collective) farms or gain permission to bring new land under cultivation through negotiations with the&#13;
local government in GBAO. This is accomplished either individually or in groups, with PRDP assistance&#13;
if necessary. Formal written contracts, which define and guarantee land access rights, must be obtained&#13;
from the Government before the farmers may participate in PRDP activities. These contracts stipulate&#13;
that the land access rights are long-term and can be inherited. They cannot be traded, although this may&#13;
be the case at a later stage.&#13;
3.7    Future sponsored activities ($1.6 million).   Additional funding will be allocated to these&#13;
programs if they continue to be successful or to other programs that meet the same criteria (para 2.3) at&#13;
the end of the first year of the project. Some of this additional funding could also be allocated to&#13;
microprojects under the TASIF, if appropriate.&#13;
B. Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (4.2 million)&#13;
3.8    This component has two sub-components (a) the development of the TASIF; and (b)&#13;
microprojects.&#13;
3.9    Development of the Taiikistan Social Investment Fund (US$ 1.5 million). The sub-component will&#13;
support the development of the TASIF through provision of equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs,&#13;
training, technical assistance, and financing for monitoring and evaluation. An international consultant&#13;
will provide technical support to the TASIF. International and local consultants will also provide support&#13;
through short missions to assist the TASIF in setting up an accounting system and an MIS, and to further&#13;
develop its targeting strategy and methodology. A beneficiary assessment will be undertaken during the&#13;
second year of the project to ascertain the impact of the microprojects on benefiting communities and&#13;
community organizations. Training will be provided to the TASIF staff on a range of topics such as&#13;
participatory community development, contracting and bidding procedures, project supervision and&#13;
evaluation, English, and computer training. A limited number of study tours will also be organized to&#13;
complement the training modules. The Project will also enable TASIF to make available some technical&#13;
assistance and training to local governments, small contractors, NGO staff and other active community&#13;
members to help them plan, manage, and implement microprojects and to participate in competitive&#13;
bidding. Whenever possible, delivery of technical support will be contracted to qualified local firms or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
individuals.&#13;
3.10   Microprojects (US$2.5 million). During the first year of the project, 10-15 pilot microprojects&#13;
will be implemented in order to train staff and test and modify the targeting, promotion, appraisal,&#13;
approval, supervision, monitoring and evaluation procedures that will be elaborated in the operational&#13;
manual. Examples of possible microprojects are: (a) social infrastructure, such as waste water canal&#13;
cleaning, irrigation repair, pump replacement, small water and sanitation stations, public baths and&#13;
latrines, and reconstruction of kindergartens, schools and health points (especially in war-affected or&#13;
remote villages); (b) environmental projects, such as reforestation, terracing, flood and mud-slide&#13;
prevention; and (c) entrepreneurial activities, such as small loans to micro-enterprises, and processing&#13;
of fruits and vegetables. During the next two years of the project, an additional-50-60 microprojects will&#13;
be implemented. The maximum size of a microproject will be US$150,000, though few will exceed&#13;
US$50,000. The average microproject size is estimated at US$30,000 in the first year and US$35,000&#13;
over the life of the project.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Overall Management of the Project&#13;
4.1    The TASIF will be the executing agency for the Project. The TASIF has been established by&#13;
Presidential Resolution with financial and administrative autonomy, and with its own charter that will&#13;
stipulates its structure and authority. It is able to enter into contracts, recruit staff from outside the civil&#13;
service and establish its own operating procedures, including those for procurement and disbursement.&#13;
Autonomy is necessary so that the TASIF can work with NGOs, local governments, private contractors&#13;
and community organizations in an efficient and effective manner.&#13;
4.2    The TASIF structure (Figure 4.1) comprises the Board for Project Realization (the "TASIF&#13;
Board') and the TASIF Executive Committee. The TASIF Board is chaired by the Prime Minister and&#13;
comprises eight representatives, four from government ministries and four from non-governmental&#13;
sectors. The TASIF Board approves the operational manual, and quarterly and annual reports; designates&#13;
external auditors; considers microproject proposals over US$50,000; and provides guidance to the&#13;
Executive Committee on the execution of the PPAP.&#13;
4.3    The Executive Committee is headed by the TASIF Executive Director, who was recruited&#13;
competitively. The Executive Director is responsible for the coordination of all TASIF activities. He&#13;
prepares the TASIF's work programs, authorizes all disbursements together with the Finance and&#13;
Administration Manager, prepares reports on the progress of the TASIF and the programs carried out by&#13;
the selected international NGOs under the first component of the project, and identifes training needs of&#13;
TASIF staff.&#13;
4.4    The Executive Committee comprises the Finance and Administration Department, Microprojects&#13;
Department covering two areas (divided into Northern and Southern areas), the Planning, Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Department, and six advisory and support units (legal, institutional support, procurement,&#13;
management information system, environment, and promotion). The Finance and Administration&#13;
Department oversees all financial and accounting matters, prepare financial and administrative reports on&#13;
the use of Project funds; prepares disbursement applications to IDA; and makes requests for&#13;
replenishment of the special account. The Microprojects Department consists of two area managers and&#13;
field engineers to oversee the preparation, appraisal and supervision of microprojects. The Management&#13;
Information System Unit will develop and maintain the MIS. The Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Department monitors the progress of the NGO programs supported under the first component and also&#13;
the microprojects; develops and monitors a targeting strategy, and coordinates reporting and evaluation&#13;
activities. The Institutional Support Unit coordinates the delivery of training and technical assistance to&#13;
contractors and communities involved with TASIF-financed microprojects, as well as to TASIF staff. The&#13;
Legal Unit is responsible for legal matters. A procurement specialist will be hired to monitor compliance&#13;
on procurement with the operational manual. A promotion specialist will organize promotional activities&#13;
for microprojects. An environmental consultant will be hired during the second year of the project to&#13;
advise on and monitor environmental aspects of microprojects. The TASIF will be staffed by about 30&#13;
professionals. The TASIF will subcontract supervision tasks and professional services to consultants and&#13;
NGOs whenever appropriate.&#13;

B. Implementation of Poverty Alleviation Programs of NGOs&#13;
Institutional Assessment of Selected Non-Government Organizations&#13;
4.5    The scaled-up poverty alleviation programs will be carried out by three major international&#13;
NGO's (SCF-US, SCF-UK and AKF) and possibly also by other NGOs to be identified at the end of the&#13;
first year of the project. The TASIF will enter into a service contract for the implementation of each&#13;
program. These selected NGOs have worldwide experience in carrying out such programs, and they each&#13;
have considerable experience specifically of working in Tajikistan.&#13;
4.6    The SCF-US is a well-established not-for-profit relief and development organization working in&#13;
over forty countries in Asia, Central Asia, Africa, South America and Eastern Europe. Its headquarters&#13;
are in Westport, Connecticut, USA. It has worked in Tajikistan since May 1994, almost exclusively in&#13;
the south-western part of the country with internally displaced persons and returned refugees, and with&#13;
support from a range of sources including USDA, USAID, Soros Foundation, UNHCR, UNDP, UNICEF&#13;
and the Government of the Netherlands, as well as from its own wide network of individual and&#13;
institutional donors. Its Tajikistan program, operated under a formal agreement with the Government of&#13;
Tajikistan, is staffed by about 160 mainly local staff, although its senior officers are expatriates. Its&#13;
current country budget is about $3.5 million. It has effective management, procurement, monitoring and&#13;
accounting procedures, and is subject to external audit. From an initial emphasis on relief, it has focussed&#13;
increasingly on creating the preconditions for local economic development in Tajikistan. It has also&#13;
undertaken several surveys on a variety of issues such as the informal economy.&#13;
4.7    The SCF-UK is an international charitable organization with headquarters in London, UK, and&#13;
field offices in countries in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. It began work in Tajikistan in October&#13;
1994 to assist with relief supplies in the southwestern part of the country (Bokhtar district, Khatlon&#13;
Oblast), an area severely damaged by civil war. Following a participatory needs assessment, it decided&#13;
to assist vulnerable children through the provision of productive assets to female-headed households&#13;
(seeds, sewing machines, livestock), and assisted about 1,000 households in this way. SCF-UK's&#13;
strategy has been to establish a cost-effective, sustainable program with a high level of group support,&#13;
community participation and empowerment, before seeking to expand its geographical coverage. A recent&#13;
evaluation indicates that the point has now been reached. The UK home office supervises and provides&#13;
logistical and administrative support to its field offices, including international recruitment of all field staff&#13;
management positions and consultants, supervision and designing of all financial management and&#13;
procurement procedures, and designing of training modules and the MIS. The field offices manage and&#13;
implement all SCF-UK in-country programs in sectors such as health, education, infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation, microenterprise development and agriculture. The program in Tajikistan is managed by&#13;
the Program Director in the office in Dushanbe who reports to the Regional Director for Central Asia&#13;
in Tashkent.&#13;
4.8    The AKF is an international philanthropic institution headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with&#13;
field offices in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It supports innovative and sustainable solutions to&#13;
problems in health, education, and the general quality of life in poor rural populations in developing&#13;
countries. In Tajikistan, where AKF has been active since 1992, the organization has its general field&#13;
office in Dushanbe. It initially undertook relief work/ration distribution in the relatively isolated GBAO&#13;
following the collapse of the Soviet Union. By charter, however, AKF is a development institution and&#13;
not a relief organization. Thus AKF subsequently established a local NGO, the PRDP in GBAO with its&#13;
headquarters in the capital, Khorog, sub-offices in all of GBAO's seven districts, and additional offices&#13;
in Osh (Kyrgyz Republic) and Moscow. Since late 1993 PRDP has been active in agricultural reform&#13;
along with continuing its humanitarian assistance to GBAO. AKF is responsible for raising funds and&#13;
reporting to donors, which presently include Germany, the European Community, Japan, Canada, USA,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
and others. It appoints PRDP's General Manager, recruits expatriate staff and consultants for evaluations,&#13;
negotiates budgets with PRDP and presents them to donors, provides funds to the PRDP, and&#13;
controls/audits its accounts. As AKF's principal partner, PRDP operates under specific instructions from&#13;
AKF on matters such as procurement, monitoring, and liaison with the authorities in GBAO. Recently&#13;
a new AKF Program Director has been assigned to Khorog which will further support PRDP's&#13;
management. Under the supervision of the AKF, PRDP itself is responsible for the implementation of&#13;
the Agricultural Reform Program, recruitment of local personnel, negotiations with the local government,&#13;
and report preparation.&#13;
Project Management, Responsibilities and Operational Plans&#13;
4.9    The Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program will be implemented by SCF-US which will be&#13;
responsible for informing the population and securing their participation through village meetings (see&#13;
Annex B). SCF-US will also be responsible, in close consultation with the community and local leaders,&#13;
for selecting and verifying beneficiaries and ensuring targeting, including a representative proportion of&#13;
women beneficiaries. Village work brigades will be formed to undertake construction based on a work&#13;
plan prepared showing project support to be provided and local participation (e.g. for organizing&#13;
transportation of materials, and construction work). Materials and food will be procured and utilized with&#13;
monitoring by local representatives and SCF-US. Village brigades (usually 15-20 persons) will be formed&#13;
from the community members. Each brigade will elect a leader, and a detailed contract will be&#13;
formalized between SC/US and the brigades (including terms and conditions, details of each house owner&#13;
and work to be done, and names of the brigade members). Usually the brigade leader will enter into&#13;
a contract with the village executive committee for the provision of transport. Food will be released&#13;
and distributed according to specified procedures against work done. Local carpenters will be trained&#13;
in roof construction. Entrepreneurs will be assisted to establish micro-enterprises. Three demonstration&#13;
houses have been tiled in order to show the technology and determine training needs. Local project&#13;
organizers, in small teams of one man and one woman, will target the neediest beneficiaries directly,&#13;
identifying them through existing lists of homeless families, supplemented by community-based&#13;
participatory social mapping, and consultation with other NGOs working in the area and key community&#13;
resource people. The organizers will assess the extent of reconstruction work to be done, assist in the&#13;
formation of work groups and the preparation of a work plan, and assist in the distribution of materials&#13;
and verify work completed. It will take between three weeks to one month to construct a house, and&#13;
brigades will work on several houses at a time. There will be a survey to verify that the construction had&#13;
been satisfactorily completed, and this will be the basis for approval of distribution of commodities.&#13;
SCF-US will report quarterly to TASIF on achievements against targets in relation to beneficiary&#13;
selection, work group formation, construction work plans, and post survey, as well as on the progress&#13;
of the tiles and training component. Site visits and training will be arranged for a small number of&#13;
selected community representatives and government officials from other parts of the country where there&#13;
is an identified housing need (rural Panjkent, Aini, Mascho), with a view to building capacity in other&#13;
local organizations for similar programs. This will enable the methodology to be adopted and adapted&#13;
to the needs of other areas where SCF/US does not work, and where similar housing needs of the very&#13;
poor exist for reasons other than destruction in civil war.&#13;
4.10   The Micro-Credit (Group Guarantee Loans and Savings) Program will also be implemented by&#13;
SCF-US (see Annex C). Staff based in the Field Office in Kurgan-Tube and in Vose will be directly&#13;
responsible for the day to day management of the program including group formations (they will form&#13;
250 women's groups and provide loans to 3,750 women micro-entrepreneurs over a 2-year period),&#13;
savings mobilization and loan disbursements and collection. The Field Office in Dushanbe will provide&#13;
overall supervision and management support and will be involved in monitoring, evaluating and reporting&#13;
in accordance with the indicators chosen. GGLS staff in SCF-US field offices in Kurgan-Tube and in&#13;
Vose, through the group promoters, will be respoisible for group formation, training of groups,&#13;
collection of baseline data on clients, assisting clients in filling out loan application forms and passbooks,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
disbursement of loans, collection of repayments and savings. GGLS offices in the field will be responsible&#13;
for supervising loan disbursement and repayment, and for maintaining financial records which will be&#13;
reported to and supervised by the office in Dushanbe. The GGLS staff or group promoters supervised&#13;
and managed by the project manager and project supervisors will be responsible for identifying potential&#13;
clients in groups, the training of groups in a basic understanding of borrowing and repayments, loan&#13;
disbursal and repayments. The GGLS group promoters work in pairs and handle an average of 12 groups&#13;
each in the first year of the project and 15 in the second year. Each group will have an average of 15&#13;
members. Group promoters will therefore handle an average of 220 clients each.&#13;
4.11   The Program of Support to Female-Headed Households will be implemented by SCF-UK (see&#13;
Annex D). Overall management of the project will be the responsibility of the program manager in&#13;
Dushanbe. Day to day operations will be managed by a project manager based in Khatlon with support&#13;
from the program administrator for procurement and logistics, as well as financial monitoring. The&#13;
training coordinator will also be involved. SCF-UK will arrange site visits and training for a small&#13;
number selected community representatives and government officials from other parts of the country, with&#13;
a view to building capacity in other local organizations for similar programs. This will enable the&#13;
methodology to be adopted and adapted to the needs of other areas where SCF-UK does not work.&#13;
4.12   The Agricultural Reform Program will be implemented by PRDP in conjunction with AKF (see&#13;
Annex E). The local PRDP Deputy General Manager in Khorog, the capital of GBAO, will supervise&#13;
the implementation of the program with technical input from the Irrigation Engineer and the Agricultural&#13;
Supervisor and general guidance from AKF's Program Director. Villagers interested in PRDP assistance&#13;
in channel construction and new land development will first form a group and appoint a leader (sardar).&#13;
They will then negotiate with the Government for permission to utilize new land once channel&#13;
construction is completed. PRDP will next sign a formal agreement with the farmers' group stating that&#13;
it will help with channel construction and land development (i.e. technical assistance and materials;&#13;
provision of seed, fertilizer, and fuel on credit; etc.). Villagers will agree to provide manual labor for&#13;
the program's activities, with Food-For-Work inputs funded by GTZ.&#13;
4.13   The details of the implementation arrangements for each of the above programs have been&#13;
included in the contracts to be signed between the three international NGOs and the TASIF. The contracts&#13;
also specify the performance indicators, together with financial reporting mechanisms, that will trigger&#13;
subsequent release of funds after the first mobilization payment. The TASIF and the three international&#13;
non-governmental organizations have reached agreement on the draft service contracts for the four&#13;
sponsored programs. These draft agreements have received the no objection of IDA.&#13;
4.14   In addition to the pre-identified international NGO programs, funds will be made available for&#13;
other sponsored programs to be identified during the Project. The implementation program for these&#13;
activities will be as follows: the criteria for the selection of the programs will be similar to those already&#13;
used for the selection of international NGO programs and will be publicized by the TASIF; applications&#13;
will be received and then reviewed by a selection committee, after which recommendations will be made&#13;
to IDA by the TASIF and the Government. After approval, these programs will be carried out during&#13;
the second year of the project. By December 31, 1997, the TASIF will have submitted to IDA, a&#13;
proposal for the use of the future sponsored program funds.&#13;

C. Tajikistan Social Investment Fund&#13;
Implementation of the Institutional Development of the TASIF&#13;
4.15   Technical assistance was provided during Project preparation to the TASIF to start to develop its&#13;
institutional capabilities and ensure that it has the capacity to fulfill its functions at Project launch. Based&#13;
on this foundation, the Project will finance equipment, vehicles, salaries, staff training, technical&#13;
assistance, studies and operating costs of the TASIF during the Project period. Staff development will&#13;
mainly be on the ground, learning-by-doing through practical application of an operational manual. A&#13;
draft of the operational manual has been prepared by TASIF including sample bidding documents for the&#13;
microprojects. Structured training in World Bank procurement and disbursement procedures, computers,&#13;
and English will be provided. Technical assistance will focus on supporting the TASIF to develop an&#13;
accounting and management information system, financial control and reporting, and community&#13;
participation. Training will be conducted on the job, through local resources and foreign technical&#13;
assistance, by exchange visits to similar projects (building on the study tours already conducted to&#13;
Armenia and Albania), and by other means as necessary. The Institutional Support Unit of the TASIF&#13;
will coordinate the training activities.&#13;
4.16   Technical assistance in the form of an international technical advisor, focusing on construction&#13;
and preparation of standards and norms, will be provided, building upon the support already in place&#13;
through PHRD grant funding. An international management advisor will focus on all aspects of&#13;
management in the TASIF, including setting work plans, time and task management, team building,&#13;
communication, and development of personnel review procedures. Short-term international and local&#13;
technical assistance will also be provided to develop and test the accounting system and MIS and targeting&#13;
strategy. During the second year of the project, the TASIF will contract out a beneficiary impact study&#13;
to examine the impact of the microprojects on benefiting communities. Technical support will also be&#13;
provided to meet the managerial and technical needs of contractors, implementing organizations and&#13;
communities to participate in competitive procurement. The TASIF will enter into a contract with one&#13;
or more qualified institutions or individuals to provide training and technical assistance.&#13;
Microprojects&#13;
4.17   The major participants involved with microprojects will be (i) the community or group that is&#13;
supposed to benefit directly from the microproject in terms of increased job opportunities and income and&#13;
improved access to services; (ii) the requesting agency, that is, the community group, NGO or local&#13;
government that presents a microproject proposal to TASIF for financing; and (iii) the implementing&#13;
agency (may be the same as the requesting agency) which will sign the framework agreement with the&#13;
TASIF and take responsibility for implementing the microproject and fulfilling tasks as stipulated in the&#13;
agreement. The implementing agency may be an NGO or other community group. Other major&#13;
participants will include staff of the Microprojects Department who will be ultimately responsible for&#13;
appraisal, supervision and quality control of microprojects; the independent supervisor who will sign a&#13;
separate agreement with the implementing agency to provide daily supervision functions; and the small&#13;
private contractors hired by implementing agencies or directly by the TASIF to undertake works. The&#13;
TASIF will conduct financing activities in accordance with a microproject cycle common to all social&#13;
funds. This cycle will be elaborated in the operational manual and refined as the TASIF accrues&#13;
experience and the NGO programs and microprojects are implemented. The stages of the microproject&#13;
cycle to be detailed in the operational manual will include the following steps.&#13;
4.18   Targeting. The TASIF will have limited funds and aims to assist the poor, and thus, not everyone&#13;
will be helped. To increase the likelihood that benefits reach the poor, one of the priorities during the&#13;
first six months of the Project will be to develop a means for improving the identification of vulnerable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
groups from among the larger population and for channeling funds selectively to them. The TASIF&#13;
strategy for targeting will be based upon the experience gained by (i) the NGO programs supported under&#13;
the first component; (ii) experimental poverty ranking already carried out at the rayon (district) level; and&#13;
(iii) existing data and major findings from the social assessment. The first seven microprojects, that have&#13;
been identified prior to development of the full targeting strategy, will be identified on the basis of&#13;
existing information about poverty and will be implemented in areas that are visibly poor, and in areas&#13;
not reached by the NGO programs supported by the first component. In addition to poverty levels, the&#13;
targeting methodology will reflect some geographic and ethnic balance, and infrastructure needs. By&#13;
December 31, 1997, the TASIF will have developed a targeting strategy satisfactory to IDA to guide&#13;
distribution of resources for the rest of the Project duration.&#13;
4.19   Promotion. Efforts will be taken to increase awareness among community members, potential&#13;
requesting and implementing agencies, and the private sector of availability of funds, the types of&#13;
microprojects supported by the TASIF, the centrality of community participation, the selection criteria,&#13;
and the procedures to be followed to obtain funds. In the first year, the TASIF will avoid large-scale&#13;
promotion activities to avoid raising expectations that cannot be met. Promotion activities will begin at&#13;
the end of the first year in targeted regions so as to generate proposals to be financed during the second&#13;
year. Whenever feasible, the TASIF will contract out promotion activities and coordinate with NGOs,&#13;
especially those involved under the first component, and with local government networks.&#13;
4.20   Identification. Microprojects will be proposed by local organizations, including local&#13;
governments, NGOs, parents and women's committees, farmers' cooperatives, health committees, and&#13;
newly-created community-based organizations. Selection criteria will be stipulated in the operational&#13;
manual, which will be acceptable to IDA at all times. The criteria for selection of the first seven&#13;
microprojects include: labor content of at least 20 percent; community contribution of at least 10 percent&#13;
(in kind or cash); cost less than US$20,000; positive impact on the lives of poor groups; implementation&#13;
possible during the winter; interest of a community organization in collaborating with the TASIF;&#13;
rehabilitation and not reconstruction; and no adverse affect on the environment. The selection criteria and&#13;
menu of microprojects will be defined and modified as necessary based on experience accrued during the&#13;
first batch of microprojects, and in consideration of the capacity of TASIF staff or qualified firms to&#13;
appraise and supervise different types of microprojects. The TASIF will start with financing a small menu&#13;
of microprojects, mostly small infrastructure works. As intermediaries and TASIF management gain&#13;
capacity, it could expand into more complex microprojects. Bank supervision and technical reviews will&#13;
monitor the capacity in the TASIF or other service providers.&#13;
4.21   Preparation. To support the TASIF's participatory objectives, the TASIF will develop&#13;
microproject proposal documents that are simple and standardized to enable communities to translate&#13;
Project ideas into feasible proposals. These will be adjusted accordingly during the first year of the&#13;
Project and integrated into the operational manual. When technical studies for microprojects are required,&#13;
they will be contracted by the TASIF. Preparation costs will be calculated according to instructions to&#13;
be provided in the operational manual.&#13;
4.22   Appraisal. The first seven microprojects will challenge the TASIF to standardize appraisal criteria&#13;
and procedures for different types of microprojects. Technical, institutional, social, and economic analysis&#13;
will be carried out for each microproject, and the tools and methods for doing this analysis will be&#13;
transferred to the operational manual. The TASIF will integrate criteria for community contribution (in&#13;
kind or cash), labor content, operation and maintenance into appraisal.&#13;
4.23   Approval. The Executive Committee will be responsible for considering the approval of&#13;
microprojects costing US$50,000 or less. The Executive Committee will be headed by the Executive&#13;
Director and will comprise the Finance and Administration Manager; the Planning, Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Manager; two Microprojects Area Managers; and the Legal Advisor. The first batch of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
microprojects and any microproject over US$50,000 will be subject to approval by the Board for Project&#13;
Realization and subject to no-objection from IDA.&#13;
4.24  Implementation. When a proposed microproject is approved by the TASIF, the local organizations&#13;
proposing the activity will become the "implementing agency" and enter into a framework agreement with&#13;
the TASIF. Whenever feasible, works will be carried out by small private contractors using labor-&#13;
intensive construction techniques in order to generate jobs. The maximum size of a microproject will be&#13;
US$150,000 though few will exceed US$50,000.&#13;
4.25   Supervision. The TASIF will decide the mode of implementation in consultation with&#13;
communities. A standard multi-party framework agreement will be signed by the implementing agency&#13;
and the TASIF, stipulating the responsibilities of each party. The framework agreement will be based&#13;
upon those used successfully in other social funds and be experimented with during project preparation.&#13;
The implementing agency will select and contract contractors under the supervision of the TASIF. The&#13;
regulations for competitive bidding will be tested and integrated into the operational manual.&#13;
Implementing agencies will enter into a separate agreement with an independent supervisor for daily, on-&#13;
site supervision of civil works contracts.&#13;
4.26   Handover. During the first year of the project, the TASIF will develop a protocol for handing&#13;
over completed microprojects to communities which will be integrated into the operational manual. This&#13;
may be done through a completion and handover meeting attended by all those involved with the&#13;
microproject.&#13;
4.27   During the first year of the project, 10-15 pilot microprojects (i.e. the initial batch of 7, plus a&#13;
second batch of about as many) will be implemented in order to test and modify as needed the targeting,&#13;
promotion, appraisal, approval, supervision, monitoring and evaluation procedures and the accounting,&#13;
MIS and administrative systems. The operational manual will be reviewed again by the TASIF Board and&#13;
IDA by the end of the first year of the project and will be used to guide the selection and implementation&#13;
of the next batch of microprojects, which will consist of 50-60 microprojects. Altogether, an estimated&#13;
70 microprojects averaging US$35,000 will be implemented during the Project.&#13;
D. Economic analysis and cost recovery&#13;
International NGO programs&#13;
4.28   The international NGO programs to be supported through the Project are all in operation and have&#13;
each been evaluated already. One of the criteria for their selection was their cost-effectiveness, and so&#13;
each program has already had a positive economic judgement.&#13;
4.29   Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program. In considering the economic analysis of this program,&#13;
the social assessment found poor housing to be a major factor in poverty and a very high priority for the&#13;
poor. Also the existing program has shown that the provision of food and materials and the creation of&#13;
work brigades generates considerable community participation, helps to create social cohesion and often&#13;
leads to other tasks and economic activities. The house owners and the communities contribute&#13;
substantially to the shelter and the house rehabilitation program. Besides their contribution of labor, they&#13;
are involved in the selection of beneficiaries, program monitoring, and negotiations with village&#13;
authorities. Home owners are also required to pay for the cost of ceilings, windows and doors, which&#13;
could amount to $50 per house. The unit cost for the rehabilitation of the houses is reasonable: the direct&#13;
unit cost of a re-roofed house is about $1,700, of which timber accounts for nearly fifty percent.&#13;
Overhead costs are estimated at 13 percent. An analysis has also been made of the economic advantage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
of using tiles rather then asbestos sheets. Although the latter are slightly cheaper, tiles last twice as long&#13;
and are considerably cheaper to repair. Health risks of asbestos are also avoided.&#13;
4.30   The Micro Credit Program. The program has a direct impact on the economic well-being of&#13;
families negatively affected by the war by stimulating economic activities at the local level.  This is&#13;
particularly important in view of the lack of any other formal source of credit. The results thus far of&#13;
the SCF-US pilot GGLS program have proven that micro-enterprises in Tajikistan can succeed. A total&#13;
of $62,000 has been disbursed to date to 524 members, whose loans are protected by 28 groups. The loan&#13;
repayment rate is 100 per cent, enabling SCF-US to collect $50,000 in repayments already and continue&#13;
to make loans of increasing size to existing members. It has started a process of social cohesion and&#13;
provides access to credit for women who have no other source. It has assisted these clients in their asset&#13;
building process. In the future program, it is projected that cost recovery will remain high and there will&#13;
also be a new savings element introduced into the program. Despite its effectiveness, however, the costs&#13;
of delivering a loan are somewhat high. An evaluation of the program a year after its implementation&#13;
found that administrative costs amounted to nearly sixty percent of the total. Micro finance experience&#13;
shows that such high costs at the start up stage of a micro credit program are not unusual, and over half&#13;
of the costs of the scaled-up program will still be to finance support and investment expenditures. The&#13;
proportion of administrative costs is projected to decline rapidly by sixty percent by the end of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.31   The Program of Support to Female-Headed Households. The evaluation of this program in 1995&#13;
concluded that the program had already successfully helped to improve the physical welfare of children&#13;
through increasing their access to food, clothing (and to some extent) educational materials. It also&#13;
concluded that the project inputs were improving the economic well being of households through both&#13;
increased consumption and market sales. The provision of agricultural assets such as livestock, seed and&#13;
tools, as well as technical advice, will increase further income levels.  The program will improve&#13;
household food security and generate a small income for families through the sale of products and it will&#13;
also contribute to social stability in an area which suffered greatly from war. SCF-UK's experience shows&#13;
that a significant positive impact can be derived by explaining the land reform process and mechanisms&#13;
for applying for land. This complements policy reform at the national level. Baseline data collected by&#13;
SCF-UK's for analysis of the cost effectiveness and benefits of the project activities will enable not only&#13;
the measurement of the overall economic benefits provided, but also an analysis of household income&#13;
overtime. Cost recovery will be in cash or in-kind, and will amount to between 100-120 per cent of the&#13;
value of the agricultural commodities provided to the households originally.&#13;
4.32   The Agricultural Reform Program has expanded much more rapidly than initially anticipated when&#13;
it began in late 1993, and the potential for additional scale-up is great. A mid-term evaluation of PRDP's&#13;
work clearly notes the success of the various program activities. In 1993 PRDP negotiated agreements&#13;
between kolkhoz (collective) farm authorities and private farmers for only 83 hectares on a pilot basis.&#13;
By 1996 this figure had strikingly increased to 1,954 hectares, which reflects a total of 2,118 agreements&#13;
between government authorities and some 4,725 farmers, with many additional farmers waiting to&#13;
participate. In addition, recent introduction of improved seeds from abroad and subsequent local&#13;
propagation has produced dramatic increases in crop yields among farmers who privately manage their&#13;
land as compared to those of the kolkhoz. Most participating farmers have obtained yields 3-4 times&#13;
higher than before, with the winter wheat crop often yielding 6 metric tons of wheat per hectare. The&#13;
planned expansion of the program will bring 3,662 hectares of new land under cultivation, and 1,600&#13;
farmers will avail of improved seed and technical guidance from PRDP. The program is highly desirable&#13;
from an economic point of view. The cost of bringing one hectare of new land under cultivation will be&#13;
only US$174. And, using very conservative figures for yields on new lands and the cost of a ton of flour&#13;
in GBAO, the total project investment of US$650,000 will be recouped within only three years. Within&#13;
eight years, the total value of the wheat produced on the new land will be approximately US$11 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
Cost recovery is already working well, with the farrners paying back in cash or kind materials (i.e. seeds,&#13;
fertilizer, and fuel) provided to them on credit. This will be continued through the scaled-up program.&#13;
TASIF Microprojects&#13;
4.33   For the TASIF microprojects, there are two main issues: (a) the relative costs and effectiveness&#13;
of a demand-driven social fund, compared to other types of social protection and employment programs;&#13;
and (b) at the micro level, the criteria for the choice of individual microprojects.&#13;
4.34   The Ministry of Labor currently operates a public works program (employing 2,762 workers in&#13;
mid-1995), and a very limited food-for-work program (reaching 700 workers). In addition, the&#13;
Government runs a cash benefit system that includes bread allowances, child allowances, student stipends,&#13;
pension benefits, unemployment benefits and other subsidies. The rationale for supporting a social&#13;
investment fund rather than expanding the existing government programs is premised on the following:&#13;
(i) the limited capacity of the current ministries, especially the Ministries of Labor, Social Protection,&#13;
Education and Health, and the difficulties experienced in other Central Asian countries in trying to&#13;
increase the efficiency of their current programs (especially in a context of fiscal collapse); and (ii) the&#13;
limitations of the transfer programs--even with IDA support through the ARSP project and improved&#13;
targeting--due to the heavy fiscal drain and constrained capacity of the Government to increase levels of&#13;
tax collection.&#13;
4.35   Regarding economic analysis at the microproject level, the demand-driven nature of the project&#13;
means that it is difficult to predict the overall economic rate of return in advance. Evidence from public&#13;
works programs worldwide suggests that cash wages paid by SIF-financed microprojects alone are not&#13;
more cost effective than cash transfers. Thus, for public works to be justified, they must create useful&#13;
assets. To ensure the cost effectiveness of individual microprojects, calculations will be made on the first&#13;
batch of microprojects to assess various norms and standards, costs per labor day of employment, cost&#13;
per beneficiary and possible rates of return for different types of microprojects (such as water supply),&#13;
in order to uncover those types of investments that accrue higher returns. Those investments with higher&#13;
returns will be reflected in the menu of microprojects. By the second year of the Project, the MIS and&#13;
unit cost database will be fully operational which will help the TASIF to arrive at least cost solutions to&#13;
infrastructure needs. The beneficiary impact assessment will ascertain the impact of pilot microprojects&#13;
on communities, and will enable the TASIF to gain understanding about who in terms of gender, age,&#13;
socioeconomic group and vulnerable status is actually benefiting. Demographic information on laborers&#13;
hired under TASIF-financed microprojects could be gathered and some assessment made of the impact&#13;
of wages on household incomes. All of this information will be valuable during the second year of the&#13;
Project as the Government and donors consider the economic rationale of continuing the TASIF after&#13;
project completeness. One of the expected outcomes of the proposed Project is that the Borrower will&#13;
demonstrate that the TASIF is a cost-effective, transparent, and efficient organization for channeling small&#13;
amounts of money to Tajik communities, and that donors will be interested in contributing funds to enable&#13;
the TASIF to continue.&#13;
E. Sustainability and Expected Impact&#13;
International NGO Programs&#13;
4.36   In 1993-4 much of the external assistance to Tajikistan was to support relief efforts, in which&#13;
sustainability was not a dominant issue. The current phase of external support is dominated by&#13;
"rehabilitation" efforts that seek to restore physical and human capital destroyed during the civil conflict.&#13;
In contrast, the proposed Project aims to go further than this in promoting development, based on&#13;
investments combined with popular participation. The sustainability issues in the first component of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
project address primarily questions of sustainability of impact, although increasingly emphasis will be&#13;
placed on the sustainability of the new processes being put in place.&#13;
4.37    The Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program.  Sustainability of impact has already been&#13;
demonstrated in the earlier phases of this program, and the reconstruction of homes meets a priority need&#13;
of poor families in areas affected by civil conflict. Many of the residents of these areas were internally&#13;
displaced from the war, and their first need, in returning to their destroyed homes to resume their lives,&#13;
is for a place to stay. The rebuilding or repair of habitable structures is also a first step in a process of&#13;
re-establishing viable communities. The basic structure, created through the program, is followed by&#13;
further voluntary home improvements entirely from local resources, and provides both a physical and a&#13;
moral basis for further developments: by investment in family gardens, development of household level&#13;
economic activities (small stock, silkworm cultivation, baking bread, petty commerce, group micro-credit)&#13;
and in community infrastructure (water, roads, schools, kindergartens etc). In addition, the work&#13;
brigades, formed largely of neighborhood residents who help each other in reconstruction work,&#13;
contribute to social cohesion and further economic cooperation.  They also help to reintegrate&#13;
able-bodied, economically active men into local society, one of the most compelling needs for economic&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
4.38   The Micro Credit (Group Guarantee Loans and Savings) Program. The aim is to develop the&#13;
existing program   into a sustainable local NGO or financial services institution that can operate&#13;
independently within four years and can sustain the access to capital for poor women. Within two years&#13;
from the start date of this upscaled program, a core group of borrowers and GGLS staff will begin&#13;
participating in SCF-US sponsored training and will produce an agenda for the development of a local&#13;
apex institution that can fully operate a microcredit program within four years. Various operating&#13;
responsibilities related to the GGLS program will be handed over to the client groups after the last year&#13;
of the Project period (which will be the fourth year of the GGLS program) as their capacity dictates. In&#13;
the fourth year of the GGLS program, groups receiving credit and savings services will be managed and&#13;
monitored by this apex NGO. The GGLS program will also be linked, through the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation process, to the TASIF according to the operational manual guidelines. This should enable&#13;
GGLS to network with client groups and organizations beyond its present area of operation and enable&#13;
it to increase its client base. To address the issue of financial sustainability, savings will be an important&#13;
component of the project.  Savings serves as an indicator of profit and commitment as well as&#13;
sustainability. The GGLS program will require clients to save on a weekly basis which will total three&#13;
per cent percent of the loan in a cycle. Group savings perform many functions, including serving as a&#13;
guarantee for defaults and being available for future capital expansion. Group members will be&#13;
encouraged to open individual or group savings accounts once the banking facilities are available in the&#13;
area. All 3,750 group members will get loans in three month cycles. At the close of the first year of the&#13;
project 3,450 loans will be disbursed to 1,500 members. Disbursed loans will be protected by 100&#13;
groups, averaging 15 members per group. In the first and second quarter of the first year 20 groups each&#13;
will enter the first loan cycle. Similarly in the second year 30 groups each will enter the first loan cycle.&#13;
Similarly, in the second year, 30 groups each in first and second quarters, and 45 groups each in last&#13;
two quarters, will join the first cycle of loan. Upon the successful completion of a loan cycle in the end&#13;
of each quarter, groups will enter a new loan cycle and will remain constant once they reach the fourth&#13;
cycle. Repayments of loan with interest from the first year will be revolved for continued funding in&#13;
subsequent years. The proposed loan funding will allow all groups to reach the fourth loan cycle and&#13;
continue receiving loans indefinitely provided additional funding is secured to pay a portion of the&#13;
program costs. SCF-US estimates the program will be 6 percent operationally self sustainable at the end&#13;
of the first year and 27 percent, 72 percent and 144 percent at the end of the second, third and fourth&#13;
years respectively, with the standard interest charge of 10 percent (to which 3 per cent will be added to&#13;
make the total service charge 13 per cent). However, the three percent will be deposited in group names&#13;
and will remain as the savings for the group. Groups will have full authority in the utilization of the&#13;
savings fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.39   Support to Female-Headed Households Program. These households are among the most&#13;
vulnerable in the areas affected by civil conflict. The small inputs provided to the most severely affected&#13;
families from the civil conflict have enabled a modest but sustained improvement in family economy and&#13;
health, as evidenced by the nutritional state of the children. The evaluation of August 1995 found&#13;
abundant evidence that the project had generated productive family investment (livestock increase, family&#13;
stocks of seed) and household economic activities. Although started as a relief exercise, payback in kind&#13;
(seed potatoes, small stock) was introduced in order to increase sustainability and cost-effective coverage.&#13;
Equally important, the advocacy and educational work with women has generated a tangible increase in&#13;
their motivation and self-confidence, for example in dealing with local authorities over land rights or&#13;
other entitlements. The continuation of this project over two years in Bokhtar and its extension to Vakhsh&#13;
will extend this impact, with attention to improving the payback system. The inclusion of an element of&#13;
documentation, training and extension is intended to ensure replication of this project in other parts of&#13;
the country where SCF-UK does not operate, possibly with the support of TASIF.&#13;
4.40   The Agricultural Reform Program  This program is still extremely relevant for GBAO. Since&#13;
the collapse of the Soviet Union, the whole populace of GBAO has been dependent upon AKF-sponsored&#13;
food rations for survival. Change is occurring, however, and in recent years initial steps have been taken&#13;
by PRDP towards the development of a sustainable agricultural system. A mid-term evaluation of the&#13;
NGO's work conducted in 1995 concluded that wheat self-sufficiency is possible in future years if land&#13;
reform continues and the general economy of the region improves. This program has as its target the&#13;
additional cultivation of 3,877 hectares of new land which, along with the previously privately managed&#13;
land coordinated by PRDP, will produce some 14,000 metric tons of wheat in the next two years, which&#13;
is approximately half of the region's total requirement. Private entrepreneurship will also be encouraged&#13;
through the sale of food surplus. In this regard, PRDP is actively fostering the development of local&#13;
markets, which are crucial to the establishment of a sustainable agricultural system for GBAO.&#13;
TASIF microprojects&#13;
4.41   The fact that the TASIF will be demand-driven makes it difficult to estimate quantitatively and&#13;
in advance the impact of the microprojects. Furthermore, the modest amount of funds for microprojects&#13;
during the Project means that the overall impact on poverty alleviation in a country with vast numbers&#13;
of poor will also be modest. However, the expected impacts are still significant and will include: (a) a&#13;
transparent mechanism (the TASIF) that could provide financing, monitoring, and technical support in&#13;
the future to an increased number of community requests for small investments, in the event that funds&#13;
continue to be made available for future activities; (b) improved quality, regularity and availability of&#13;
social and economic services used by the poor; (c) unskilled and semi-skilled jobs during the&#13;
implementation phase; and (d) increased capacity of community organizations to plan, manage and&#13;
implement small investments. While male laborers and their families are likely to be direct beneficiaries&#13;
of most short-term job opportunities created by the microprojects, women and children in 70&#13;
communities, averaging 2,000 population each, will benefit as a result of the rehabilitation and restoration&#13;
of small infrastructure and services.&#13;
4.42   Sustainability is a concern at both the institution (TASIF) and microproject level. First, although&#13;
the Project is being conceived as a short-term program of three years, if it is successful the TASIF could&#13;
and should be continued. The Project will build the institutional capacities of TASIF, as well as local&#13;
agents (such as local government units and NGOs), so that they could carry out poverty alleviation&#13;
programs in the future. Second, presentation of a plan for operating and maintaining the microproject will&#13;
be one of the criteria for microproject approval. Priority will be given to repairs and reconstruction of&#13;
facilities that are currently operating and for which salaries of service personnel are already budgeted.&#13;
Finally, the emphasis on community participation in microproject design and implementation will improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the prospects for sustainability. The ability of communities to pay directly for the operating and&#13;
maintenance costs of rehabilitated infrastructure may be limited, and so it is envisaged that local&#13;
contributions (equivalent to 10 per cent of the total cost of each microproject) may often be in the form&#13;
of donated time and labor, rather than money.&#13;
F. Enviromnental Analysis&#13;
International NGO Programs&#13;
4.43   In selecting NGO programs for support through the Project, one of the major criteria used was&#13;
their environmental impact, thus favoring the selection of projects that will have either a positive&#13;
environmental impact, or at least no negative impact.&#13;
(a) The Shelter and House Rehabilitation Program will make a significant improvement to the&#13;
built environment, both in terms of health and aesthetically, with no adverse impacts on the&#13;
natural environment. In particular, the promotion of tiled roof technology over the previously&#13;
used asbestos sheeting will remove a potential health hazard. The reconstruction of ruined houses&#13;
also acts as an incentive to further environmental improvements, such as clearance of rubble and&#13;
other evidence of war damage, improvement of environmental sanitation, and removal of other&#13;
health hazards. SCF-US has also instituted extensive checks to ensure that food provided under&#13;
the food for work scheme is fit for human consumption.&#13;
(b) The Micro Credit Program and the Program Support to Female-Headed Households encourage&#13;
small-scale income generation activities which are either environmentally neutral or beneficial,&#13;
as in the case of encouragement of low external input farming systems and food production (crop&#13;
rotation, natural fertilizers) in place of high agrochemical input cotton production.&#13;
(c) The AKF/PRDP Agricultural Reform Program involves extension of gravity-flow irrigation&#13;
systems, expansion of arable land on the edges of existing fields and in valleys, and careful use&#13;
of fertilizers. In this context, AKF's long-standing commitment to socially and environmentally&#13;
sustainable development is relevant; the organization has extensive experience in agricultural&#13;
development in fragile mountain settings (e.g. in the Northern Areas of Pakistan), and promotes&#13;
sound cultivation practices, including terracing and reforestation to retain and enhance soil&#13;
fertility. Any use of fertilizers and other agrochemicals will be carefully controlled by&#13;
monitoring and farmer education.&#13;
(d) Similar environmental criteria will be applied to any other projects to be supported under the&#13;
first component of the project.&#13;
TASIF Microprojects.&#13;
4.44   Institutional support to TASIF is environmentally neutral. Microprojects to be supported under&#13;
TASIF will be individually screened and monitored for environumental impacts according to criteria to be&#13;
included in the operational manual. The project staffing structure ensures environmental analysis&#13;
capability by including the post of environmental specialist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
G. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Integrated Evaluation&#13;
4.45   An independent integrated evaluation at mid-term and project completion will be contracted by&#13;
TASIF to be undertaken by a consultant leading a multi-disciplinary team of local and international&#13;
experts. Implementing INGOs will each nominate a team member, but the team as a whole will evaluate&#13;
all aspects of both components of the project including TASIF's institutional capacity. It will visit project&#13;
sites, review reports and indicator measurements in the light of its own observations and investigations,&#13;
and seek to establish lessons to be learned both at mid-term and for Project follow-up. It will report both&#13;
to TASIF and to the Bank. Further details are in Annex L.&#13;
4.46   Key objective indicators will be measured and monitored by the Project in order to track, in a&#13;
consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives. The first Project&#13;
objective of impact on the incomes of the poor will be measured across all sub-components by five key&#13;
indicators, of which two will indicate the extent to which this objective has been met in a cost effective&#13;
and participatory fashion. In addition, each sub-component will be evaluated according to three specific&#13;
indicators relating to the particular program (e.g. shelter, micro-credit, agricultural production of female-&#13;
headed households, agricultural reform) and particular aspects of impact, coverage and sustainability.&#13;
The second Project objective of capability building will be measured by two general indicators across&#13;
all components, with a third relating specifically to the training of TASIF staff.   Thus each sub-&#13;
component will be evaluated on ten indicators, of which seven are common to all sub-components of the&#13;
Project, and three are specific to each sub-component.  These indicators, and the specific measures and&#13;
instruments to compile them, will be refined in a pilot baseline exercise .&#13;
International NGO Programs&#13;
4.47   Monitoring and evaluation activities have already been a prominent feature of the existing NGO&#13;
programs, and both Lhe findings and systems used will be built upon in the scaled-up programs. The&#13;
Project will closely monitor the scaled-up programs. Specifically, the NGOs will be asked to report to&#13;
the TASIF on a quarterly basis on the following: (i) summary of achievements: number of beneficiaries&#13;
reached (direct and indirect) versus goal; cost per beneficiary (total NGO program cost divided by&#13;
number of beneficiaries); labor content as a percentage of the NGO program budget; number of person-&#13;
days of employment generated; and operating costs as a percentage of the NGO program budget; (ii)&#13;
obstacles and issues to be overcome and resolved; (iii) targeting; (iv) community participation; (v)&#13;
financial reporting; and, (vi) sustainability.  In addition to this the NGOs will report to TASIF on&#13;
achieved targets in order to trigger release of payments by TASIF to the NGOs (see Annexes B-E).&#13;
4.48   Each of the NGO programs will also have a monitoring schedule based on its specific&#13;
characteristics (see Annexes B-E). Specifically: (i) the shelter and house rehabilitation program will be&#13;
monitored through eight indicators these are: beneficiaries, female participation, reconstruction,&#13;
distribution of materials and food and average inputs per house, construction quality and contribution to&#13;
poverty alleviation; (ii) the micro-credit program will be monitored through the bi-weekly visits to the&#13;
groups using indicators relating to group information such as business activities, attendance, repayments&#13;
and savings (iii) the program of support to female-headed households will monitor the distribution and&#13;
use of productive assets. These will be monitored on a monthly basis and at the end of each repayment&#13;
period. Field workers will report on advocacy activities every two weeks; and, (iv) the work of the&#13;
district field staff of the agricultural reform program will be monitored periodically through field visits&#13;
by PRDP staff (Deputy General Manager, Irrigation Engineer, and Agricultural Supervisor) from the&#13;
Khorog Head Office and by periodic visits by AKF staff from Geneva. Key indicators to be monitored&#13;
are number of kilometers of channel construction which have been completed, the number of schemes&#13;
completed and the number of hectares of land brought under cultivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
TASIF microprojects&#13;
4.49   An integrated monitoring and evaluation system will be developed during the first year of the&#13;
project in order to monitor and evaluate the institutional development of the TASIF and the impact of&#13;
TASIF-financed microprojects. Indicators for monitoring the progress and development of the TASIF are&#13;
given in Annex P. The means for verifying these indicators will be quarterly reports, Bank supervision,&#13;
technical assistance reports and audits. The objectives of the monitoring and evaluation activities will be&#13;
to (a) determine if there is compliance between TASIF operating regulations and procedures for&#13;
implementing contracts and microprojects; (b) provide information regularly on progress toward achieving&#13;
desirable results and facilitating reporting to the TASIF Board, the Government and donors; (c) alert&#13;
managers to actual or potential problems in implementation so that adjustments can be made; and (d)&#13;
determine whether the Project is benefiting the intended people and how. This system will comprise&#13;
microproject monitoring by TASIF staff and communities; the MIS; and a beneficiary assessment. When&#13;
fully operational, the computerized MIS will track progression of microprojects through the microproject&#13;
cycle, provide transparency and accountability of financial flows, monitor civil works progress based on&#13;
field supervision reports, and flag microprojects experiencing unusual delays and cost overruns. By the&#13;
second year of the project, MIS-generated information will be used in the daily decision making and&#13;
operations of the TASIF; and will be an integral part of the reports submitted by the TASIF management&#13;
to the TASIF Board; and of quarterly reports and comprehensive annual reports submitted to donors.&#13;
While the MIS will generate information on the physical and financial progress of works, a beneficiary&#13;
assessment will be utilized to evaluate the impact of microprojects on benefiting communities.&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
5.2     Project costs have been estimated in US Dollars due to difficulties in forecasting inflation&#13;
rates for local currency. Estimates for civil works and goods, including construction materials, equip-&#13;
ment and vehicles required for the scaled-up programs to be implemented by international NGOs, as&#13;
well as for the establishment and operation of TASIF are based on the itemized cost estimates in the&#13;
NGO's submitted proposals as well as on unit prices for similar items recently procured in the coun-&#13;
try by other aid agencies. Estimates for management and administration services of the selected&#13;
NGOs required to implement their programs are based on rates provided, and on the basis of recent&#13;
prices for comparable services. The estimated Project cost also include the institutional strengthening&#13;
of the newly established TASIF. The average cost of microprojects, consisting mainly of small civil&#13;
works, is estimated at US$35,000 equivalent, with the maximum being US$150,000 equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
These estimates have been reviewed by Bank staff and found acceptable. Base cost estimates reflect&#13;
prices as projected at time of negotiations.&#13;
Incremental Operating Costs&#13;
5.3 The operating costs for TASIF are estimated at US$0.99 million equivalent and consist of: a)&#13;
maintenance for facilities and equipment procured and leased under the Project; b) salaries of TASIF&#13;
staff, as well as per diem expenses for field work and trips related to the Project; c) consumable&#13;
office supplies; (d) salaries of contract staff; and (e) office operating expenses such as utilities, repro-&#13;
duction and communication charges related to the project. Items will be procured according to the&#13;
procedures described in the operational manual in compliance with IDA Guidelines. The personnel&#13;
for TASIF will be hired on fixed term contract through a competitive selection acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
5.4    The foreign exchange component of US$6.45 million represents 51% of project cost, net of&#13;
duties and taxes. The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: a) small civil works for&#13;
microprojects, 20%; b) goods: equipment (including computers and related office equipment) and&#13;
vehicles, 90%; furniture, 60%; technical assistance and services: foreign experts, 95%, local experts,&#13;
10%; study tours and fellowships, 100%; and local training, 10%.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
5.5    Physical contingencies (US$0.70 million) represent six (6) percent of the base cost. Price&#13;
contingencies (US$0.25 million) represent about two (2) percent of base cost plus physical contin-&#13;
gencies. Total contingencies represent about eight (8) percent of the base cost. Contingencies will&#13;
not be applied to the microprojects component and any increase in the average micro-project cost will&#13;
be reflected in a reduced number of microprojects financed.&#13;
Taxes and Customs Duties&#13;
5.6   Project costs include an estimated US$0.10 million equivalent in taxes and duties on civil&#13;
works and locally procured goods. Goods specifically imported for the Project will be exempt from&#13;
custom duties and taxes. International personnel will be exempt from local income taxes.&#13;
B. Project Financing&#13;
Financial Plan&#13;
5.7    The proposed Credit of US$12.0 million equivalent will finance 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
exchange component (US$6.5 million) and about 92 percent of local costs (US$ 5.7 million), exclud-&#13;
ing duties and taxes. The Government and/or participating entities will provide about US$0.7 million&#13;
equivalent or about five (5) percent of total Project costs.&#13;

Local Cost Sharing/Counter Part Funds&#13;
5.8    The Tajik local counter part funds will consist of: (a) the Government's local cost sharing&#13;
contribution (the rent of the building and utilities for TASIF); and (b) the micro projects (10% of the&#13;
civil works). In addition, the local community contribution to the micro projects representing about&#13;
10% of their costs will be mostly in-kind and is not included in the project cost.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
5.9    The TASIF will have overall administrative responsibility for Project coordination and over-&#13;
sight, including carrying out the procurement of the second (TASIF/Microproject) component of the&#13;
Project as well as the monitoring and review of the procurement activities carried out on its behalf by&#13;
the selected NGOs in the implementation of their sponsored programs. TASIF will be responsible for&#13;
ensuring that all implementing agencies undertake procurement according to procedures stated in the&#13;
operational   manual approved by the Bank. Procurement arrangements will be designed to increase&#13;
Project sustainability through involvement of communities, NGOs, and local governments in imple-&#13;
mentation and maintenance of microprojects and NGO programs; increase capacity of small private&#13;
contractors; respond to the need for flexible use of procurement methods, given the differences and&#13;
disparities in the institutional capacity of communities, availability of services, markets and local&#13;
contractors, and familiarity of local contractors with competitive bidding in different regions. Train-&#13;
ing will be provided for TASIF staff, implementing agencies and contractors involved in procurement.&#13;
5.10   The Presidential Decree establishing the TASIF has exempted it from the public procurement&#13;
and disbursement regulations, present or future, and has permitted the TASIF to test and develop pro-&#13;
curement guidelines based on the Credit Agreement that will be detailed in the TASIF operational&#13;
manual.&#13;
5.11   A contract will be signed between the TASIF and each of the international NGOs under the&#13;
first component of the Project - Scaling-up of existing poverty alleviation programs. The contractual&#13;
agreement will be based on the World Bank standard form of contract for consultant services under a&#13;
lump sum. The three International NGOs have been selected on a sole source basis. The NGOs will&#13;
act as procurement consultants to the TASIF and will follow agreed World Bank's procurement proce-&#13;
dures as described below and as set forth in the Credit Agreement utilizing the Bank's standard bid-&#13;
ding documents, adapted as appropriate, and as agreed with the World Bank for the procurement of&#13;
all items required to carry out their agreed programs. A similar approach will be used for the future&#13;
sponsored programs.&#13;

Summary of Procurement Procedures&#13;
5.12   Procurement of Works, Goods and Services will be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995 (revised January and&#13;
August 1996) and "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August 1981. Table 5.3 below summarizes proposed pro-&#13;
curement arrangements. Annex N contains the Project Procurement Plan.&#13;
Procurement of Civil Works&#13;
5.13   Civil Works (US $1.96 million) will be procured as follows:&#13;
(a) National Competitive Bidding (NCB). For civil works for Component II of the project&#13;
under the Microprojects, TASIF will follow the agreed procedures described in the operational manu-&#13;
al. All civil works contract above US$30,000 equivalent will be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
up to an maximum aggregate amount of US$1.18 million. The maximum size of the microprojects&#13;
will be US$ 150,000 equivalent.&#13;
(b) Small Civil Works (SCW). Civil works contracts below US$30,000 equivalent up to&#13;
and aggregate of US$ 0.68 million equivalent will be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of three quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in re-&#13;
sponse to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a description of the works, including basic&#13;
specifications, the expected completion date, a form of contract acceptable to the Bank and relevant&#13;
drawings if applicable. Since the contracts are small and widely scattered geographically, it is unlike-&#13;
ly that foreign firms will be interested, therefore ICB is not considered feasible.&#13;
(c)    Comunity Related Procurement: In exceptional circumstances works in remote areas&#13;
where contractors are not available, estimated to cost $10,000 equivalent or less per contract and&#13;
$100,000 equivalent or less in aggregate shall be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
5.14   Goods (US$ 4.39 million). Consisting of construction materials, equipment including com-&#13;
puters and office equipment, vehicles and supplies will be grouped to the extent possible and consid-&#13;
ering project objectives, in package sizes that will encourage competitive bidding. The following&#13;
methods of procurement will be followed:&#13;
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures will be utilized for goods&#13;
for contracts above US$250,000 equivalent for a total of about US$2.72 million (62%&#13;
of total goods). These goods will consist of construction materials consisting of roof-&#13;
ing tiles and timber, inter alia.&#13;
(b) International Shopping (IS) procedures will be used for readily available off-the-&#13;
shelf goods (including equipment) of standard specifications that are small in value&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$250,000 (but more than $50,000) up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$1.24 million (27% of total goods). Due to the urgency to rehabilitate the first&#13;
200 houses by the end of 1997, IS procurement procedures will be used to procure&#13;
timber for roof trusses estimated at US$0.17 million necessary for their rehabilitation&#13;
(under the SCF-US Housing Program-2000 houses total). ICB procedures will be used&#13;
for the timber required to rehabilitate the remaining 1,800 houses. IS procedures will&#13;
require quotations from at least three (3) supplier from two different eligible coun-&#13;
tries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(c) National Shopping (NS) procedures will be used for goods estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$50,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$0.39 million (5% of total goods)&#13;
consisting of goods ordinarily available in the country. Quotations from three suppli-&#13;
ers will be required.&#13;
(d) Direct Contracting (DC) procedures will be used to procure roofing tiles from&#13;
an established and experienced local NGO. The climatic conditions in Tajikistan allow&#13;
for a short construction window between June and October. It is expected that at least&#13;
200 houses can be built within this period in 1997 after the project becomes effective&#13;
if materials can be procured quickly. Therefore to achieve the objectives, tiles for&#13;
the first 200 houses will be procured through direct contracting from an established&#13;
and experience local NGO. This will allow delivery of tile required for the rehabili-&#13;
tation of the first 200 houses by the end of 1997 under the SCF-US housing program.&#13;
The estimated amount for this contract US$ 0.09 million. The remaining amount for&#13;
tiles and incidental services required to rehabilitate the rest of the houses will be pro-&#13;
cured utilizing ICB procedures. Direct contracting may also be used in special circum-&#13;
stances for microprojects subject to prior review and approval by the World Bank and&#13;
as stated in the Operational Manual.&#13;
Preference for Domestically Manufactured Goods.&#13;
5.15   For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set&#13;
forth in the Credit Agreement, grant a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids up to&#13;
15% or the amount of applicable custom duties, which ever is lower, to qualified domestic&#13;
manufacturers of goods.&#13;
Selection Procedures for Consulting Services&#13;
5.16   Contracts for consulting services (technical assistance) as well as training required for the&#13;
Project will be awarded following the World Bank Guidelines for the "Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Consulting services&#13;
and training in the amount of US$4.59 million and US$0.20 million respectively, will be obtained&#13;
mostly through international NGO organizations for their administrative and management services&#13;
regarding the sponsored programs. The three international NGOs have been selected through a sole&#13;
source basis. There are several local consultants with the required skills and backgrounds; their par-&#13;
ticipation in project assignments is expected to be high. Technical assistance required under the the&#13;
three International NGO sponsored programs is itemized in the individual proposals in Annexes B-E.&#13;
Technical assistance for TASIF will include, but not be limited to, long-term technical advisor and&#13;
short term consultants, to assist the Finance and Administration Department and the Information and&#13;
Monitoring Unit of TASIF. Service contracts will consist of local supervisors hired by the imple-&#13;
menting agencies, for a specified term, to supervise microproject implementation. Engineering ser-&#13;
vices will also be contracted to provide the technical expertise required in finalizing proposals for&#13;
TASIF consideration. An independent, annual, ex-post technical and procurement review, will also&#13;
be financed under the project to ensure compliance with agreed procedures.&#13;

Prior Review of Procurement Arrangements&#13;
5.17 Prior review by the IDA will be as follows:&#13;
(a)       Goods and Works:   Prior review of bidding documents for goods and&#13;
review of evaluation and recommendations for award of contracts, will be carried out for&#13;
all procurement utilizing ICB, and DC procedures. Contracts to be awarded using NCB,&#13;
SW, IS and NS procedures will require prior review of the list of the proposed goods, in-&#13;
cluding estimated costs. Standardized NCB, IS and NS bidding documents and proposed&#13;
contract awards, in a sufficient number (minimum of 5 each) to ensure compliance with&#13;
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines will be subject to prior review by the WB.&#13;
(b) Consulting Services: Technical assistance/services provided under the first com-&#13;
ponent of the project, have been described in the Lump-Sum contractual agreements be-&#13;
tween TASIF and the international NGOs. Draft contracts have been reviewed by IDA,&#13;
including the proposed fees. Future Sponsored programs under the first component of the&#13;
project will be subject to prior review. The selection of consultant firms and individuals&#13;
will be in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for use of Consultants (August&#13;
1981). Terms of reference for all consulting assignments will be subject to prior IDA&#13;
review. Terms and conditions of contracts for all technical assistance assignments, invita-&#13;
tion packages and evaluation reports of assignments costing more than US$30,000 each&#13;
for firms, and US$10,000 each for individual consultants will be subject to prior review&#13;
by IDA.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR):&#13;
5.18 A CPAR has not been prepared. Since the breakup of the FSU, all rules and regu-&#13;
lations concerning procurement have become basically invalid.  For this Project, the&#13;
Government will follow the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines as described above and&#13;
as set forth in the Credit Agreement.&#13;
Procurement Monitoring Requirements&#13;
5.19 Procurement will be carefully monitored by the TASIF. All documentation will be&#13;
kept at the TASIF office. TASIF Quarterly Reports and Yearly Reports will provide&#13;
information on procurement.&#13;
D. Disbursements&#13;
Schedule&#13;
5.20 The proposed IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed in about three (3) years which&#13;
included six (6) months for the finalization of accounts and submission of withdrawal&#13;
applications and other reports. Annex P contains the disbursement forecast which is based&#13;
on detailed discussions with the NGO's and which is considered realistic. The Project&#13;
Completion Date will be December 31, 1999, with a Credit Closing Date of June 30,&#13;
2000.&#13;

Special Account&#13;
5.22 To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government of Tajikistan (TASIF)&#13;
will establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to IDA, a special account&#13;
in US dollars in a commercial bank that meets the requirements. During the early stage&#13;
of the project, the initial allocation of the special account will be limited to US$200,000.&#13;
However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of&#13;
US$1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of&#13;
US$500,000 by submitting the relevant application for Withdrawal. Replenishment appli-&#13;
cations should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank&#13;
statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. A condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness will be the initial deposit by the Government of its share of project&#13;
expenses for the first year, equivalent to US$75,000 into the project account. By the&#13;
end of October 1997, the Government will deposit the balance of its contribution&#13;
($175,000) of the Project, totaling US$250,000 equivalent.&#13;
5.23 Payment schedule for the management and administrative services contracted with&#13;
the international NGOs will be stated in their respective contractual agreements with&#13;
TASIF. Payments will be effected directly by IDA after verification of receipt of deliver-&#13;
ables as described in the contract. SCF-UK will receive an advance from the special ac-&#13;
count to be for up-front purchases necessary to implement the FHH project in an amount&#13;
needed to cover the first months of operation, and replenishment will take place after&#13;
reconciling invoices and receipts of expenditures incurred minus the advance. For the&#13;
SCF-US micro-credit program, a scroll account will be set up for the loan funds required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
and kept on the name of the program to be disbursed according to procedures described in&#13;
the proposal. Interests accrued and mini loan repayments will be credited to this account.&#13;
5.24 For microprojects, goods and single purchases of less than US$50,000, disburse-&#13;
ments will be made on the basis of statement of expenditures (SOE). For microprojects,&#13;
disbursement will be made based on expenditures incurred under the framework agree-&#13;
ment for microproject implementation. For services, disbursement will be made on the&#13;
basis of SOE for disbursement less than US$30,000 to consulting firms and less than&#13;
US$10,000 to individuals. All other disbursements will be fully documented by the TASIF&#13;
in a manner acceptable to IDA. The SOEs and all records, including framework agree-&#13;
ments between the TASIF and implementing agencies, contractors, and bidding docu-&#13;
ments, invoices, and payroll vouchers will be retained by the TASIF to facilitate inspec-&#13;
tion by supervision missions and external audit.&#13;
5.25 Disbursement procedures for microprojects will be tested and modified as necessary&#13;
during the first year of the project. Disbursements for the first batch of microprojects will&#13;
be stipulated in the first draft of the operational manual. Modifications acceptable to IDA&#13;
will be made based on this experience and used for the second batch of microprojects.&#13;
Whenever possible, the TASIF will transfer the funds directly to the accounts of the sup-&#13;
plier and the contractor, upon authorization from the implementing agency.&#13;

Progress Reporting&#13;
5.26 The Finance and Administration Department of TASIF will comprise skilled staff&#13;
and will receive technical assistance and training to develop an accounting system capable&#13;
of handling hundreds of microprojects and transactions. Prior to the development of this&#13;
system, the TASIF will use a simplified, off-the-shelf accounting system acceptable to&#13;
IDA in order to maintain accounts while the more sophisticated system is being devel-&#13;
oped. At all times, the TASIF will maintain accounts in accordance with the required&#13;
financial standards which will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The TASIF will provide IDA copies of reports submitted to the TASIF Board, in-&#13;
cluding Quarterly Reports, the Annual Plan, Annual Budget, and Annual Report.&#13;
Mid-Term Review&#13;
5.27 The Bank and TASIF will carry out a niid-tern project review by June 30,&#13;
1998. The review will be designed to evaluate the experience of the TASIF at the opera-&#13;
tional level. Draft terms of reference for the review will be provided by the Bank to the&#13;
Government and will be finalized in consultation with the TASIF.&#13;

Implementation Completion Report (ICR)&#13;
5.28 The TASIF will prepare in conjunction with the Bank, an ICR upon completion of&#13;
the Project and in any event not later than six months after final disbursement of the&#13;
Credit proceeds. Included in the ICR will be an assessment of the execution and initial&#13;
operation of the Project, costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the performance of&#13;
the Borrower, the Bank and other agencies involved in the Project regarding their respec-&#13;
tive obligations and accomplishments, and including lessons learned.&#13;

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.1      There are three types of benefit expected to be derived from  the Project.&#13;
(a)      First, about 44,000 households (or 5 percent of the population) will bene-&#13;
fit directly, either from the scaled-up programs run by the selected non-govern-&#13;
ment organizations, or from the micro-projects funded through the TASIF. The&#13;
benefits will be partly short-term, through increased employment generation and&#13;
better services, and partly longer-term, through improved living standards. These&#13;
benefits will also be varied in nature, including improved family incomes and&#13;
nutrition, reconstructed shelter, rehabilitated infrastructure, improved supplies of&#13;
agricultural inputs and services, and wider public availability of information.&#13;

(b)      Second, the  Project will have  important institutional benefits, through&#13;
strengthening indigenous capacities to target, appraise and monitor efforts to&#13;
reduce poverty. This will not only be in the TASIF, but also in the national and&#13;
local govermnents, and in local non-government organizations.  In addition, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Project will contribute to community strengthening through the increased involve-&#13;
ment and local ownership of development activities.&#13;
(c)    Third, the Project will set the stage for a larger program of poverty allevi-&#13;
ation in the future, modified as appropriate on the basis of the experience of the&#13;
pilot, and assist the Government in trying to attract additional financing.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2    There are three main risks associated with the Project. These are as follows:&#13;
(a)    First, the security situation in much of the country is fragile, and there is&#13;
still some fighting in the East. To reduce this risk, the first component of the&#13;
Project has been designed to support the extension of poverty alleviation activities&#13;
in areas where programs are already successfully underway. Expansion or replica-&#13;
tion of these or other programs and the microprojects financed by the TASIF will&#13;
be undertaken only where the situation is sufficiently stable.&#13;
(b)    Second, political factors could compromise the autonomy, credibility and&#13;
effectiveness of the programs supported by the international non-governmental&#13;
organizations and the newly established TASIF. The risk to the former will be&#13;
minimized through regular cooperation between the non-government organizations&#13;
and the TASIF staff. This cooperation will be facilitated by technical assistance&#13;
provided through the Project. This risk will also be reduced by detailing the roles&#13;
and responsibilities of the Government and the NGOs in individual contracts, and&#13;
monitoring fulfillment of obligations through the Project's monitoring and evalua-&#13;
tion system and regular Bank supervision. Another risk is interference in daily&#13;
operations which will compromise the TASIF's credibility and effectiveness to ap-&#13;
prove microprojects in an unbiased and rapid manner. To reduce these risks, the&#13;
TASIF is being established as a semi-autonomous body, with a Board of non-gov-&#13;
ernmental and governmental members and chaired by the Prime Minister. This ar-&#13;
rangement should create a high profile and broad ownership, and thus help protect&#13;
the integrity of the TASIF. There will also be comprehensive institutional checks&#13;
and balances, and efficient operating procedures detailed in the operational man-&#13;
ual, which will be checked closely during project supervision.&#13;
(c)    Third, there are risks associated with the limited managerial, technical and&#13;
institutional capacity of local organizations responsible for proposing and imple-&#13;
menting microprojects, and for financing the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
microprojects after completion. To reduce these risks, the appraisal procedures for&#13;
the microprojects will include careful analysis of institutional capacity, and techni-&#13;
cal assistance will be provided to fill institutional, technical and management gaps.&#13;
Furthermore, increased community participation in the identification and imple-&#13;
mentation of the microprojects will increase the likelihood that microprojects&#13;
respond to urgent community needs, thus increasing the likelihood for sustaining&#13;
investments.&#13;

PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
SHELTER AND HOUSE REHABILITATION PROGRAM (SAVE THE CHILDREN-US)&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The proposed two-and-a-half year project will alleviate poverty through assisting 2000 returned&#13;
families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes in five districts most devastated by the recent civil&#13;
war.  This is 37% of the identified need. 420 tonnes of food (wheat flour, beans and oil) will be&#13;
provided to over 100 work groups each of 15-20 persons, representing an estimated 210,000 days of&#13;
labor. At least 2000 other families are expected to benefit through reduction of overcrowding, double&#13;
and triple family occupancy of single homes being common. The project will also promote the adoption&#13;
of environmentally sound roofing technology ie. use of fiber-cement tiles in place of asbestos roofing&#13;
sheets. Local communities will be involved in beneficiary identification, monitoring of food distribution&#13;
and construction, and in the identification of subsequent priorities in poverty alleviation. The project will&#13;
be self-targeting, with controls to ensure the inclusion of the neediest beneficiaries and to prevent&#13;
misallocation of inputs. The project will operate in the priority need districts areas of: Bokhtar, Vakhsh,&#13;
Kolkhozabad, Kabodien and Shaartuz districts in the Khatlon region of Tajikistan. The project would&#13;
be implemented by SCF-US Tajikistan and would have a budget of $3.5 million.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    Much of the devastation during the 1992-3 civil war was concentrated in two areas of Western&#13;
Khatlon Region. In some instances entire villages were razed. Although UNHCR and SCF-US have&#13;
assisted many thousands to rebuild their homes, there remains a backlog of over 6,000 identified families&#13;
whose houses are not rebuilt, the most needy districts being Bokhtar (2,000 houses), Vakhsh (1,700)&#13;
Kabodien and Shaartuz (750 each) and Kolkhozabad (400). These numbers are increasing as more&#13;
families return to their ruined homes. Most of these families cannot feed themselves or satisfy basic&#13;
health and education needs, let alone finance reconstruction. Even if they had the resources, locally&#13;
available roofing materials are lacking. Basic shelter (2-3 rooms) is a fundamental precondition for&#13;
economic rehabilitation, which can be carried out through other means (development of household plots,&#13;
income generation activities, employment creation, re-establishment of social service infrastructure).&#13;
Therefore it is not surprising that the social assessment of the Bank identified housing needs as a critical&#13;
priority of the poor.&#13;
3.    Compounding the situation is massive unemployment and underemployment; factories and&#13;
enterprises are non-functioning, the micro-economies of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes is in advanced&#13;
decline, and workers have either been laid off or receive no salaries, or partial and irregular salaries.&#13;
Skilled craftsmen, including carpenters, builders, mechanics, are largely idle or have left Tajikistan to&#13;
find employment elsewhere in the CIS. Finally, there is a chronic and serious food deficit. On a&#13;
different level, there is a pressing need to reestablish security, law and order, community cohesion, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
an atmosphere of trust and cooperation between local communities and local governments and institutions,&#13;
so that people can begin to resume normal lives. The cramped, destitute living conditions of the&#13;
populations can only serve to create or exacerbate local tensions.&#13;
4.    The project would aim to alleviate poverty by satisfying a significant portion (37 percent) of the&#13;
identified housing needs within two years, creating employment through seasonal local work groups, and&#13;
fostering community cooperation and solidarity through such neighborhood associations. The project&#13;
would also temporarily relieve the food deficit, pending an eventual rise in local food production, and&#13;
support local entrepreneurs and craftsmen in the promotion of an environmentally-sound technology: the&#13;
production and use of fiber-cement tiles.&#13;
5.    Specific objectives would be that, by the end of two years (March 1997 to March 1999):&#13;
(a)    Two thousand needy homeless families would have reconstructed basic shelter (kitchen,&#13;
living room/bedroom) with assistance from local Food For Work (FFW) brigades.&#13;
(b)    Local community FFW brigades would have carried out reconstruction activities for 2000&#13;
houses, and improved their families' food security through the estimated 420 MT of food&#13;
(wheat flour, beans, oil) which would be distributed as compensation for approximately&#13;
210,000 days equivalent of labor (note: FFW calculations are based on reconstruction&#13;
completed, not time spent).&#13;
(c)    The demonstrated practice of community participation in reconstruction, needs&#13;
identification and monitoring would have produced measurable positive changes in&#13;
community attitudes towards defining and meeting local development needs, both in the&#13;
project area and in other parts of the country (indirect benefit).&#13;
(d)    The successful use of fiber-cement roofing tiles would have supported the expansion of&#13;
an environmentally-friendly technology, the creation a cadre of skilled workers, both&#13;
within the program area and in other parts of the country (indirect benefit).&#13;
STRATEGY AND TARGETING&#13;
6.    The strategy would aim to alleviate poverty through supporting community self-help efforts to&#13;
create the physical and social infrastructure that will enable a community to address more long-term&#13;
needs. The area selected contains a majority of returned refugees and IDPs who need to be reintegrated&#13;
into local communities. Further direct targeting of beneficiaries would be undertaken during the project&#13;
to ensure that benefits will be targeted to the neediest families.  The project beneficiaries would be&#13;
primarily, although not necessarily exclusively, the neediest families with many small children, widows,&#13;
families caring for orphans and pensioners, and would include an equitable proportion of women-headed&#13;
households. Currently, approximately 30 per cent of the brigade members are women, many brigades&#13;
have a majority of women members, and some brigades are entirely composed of women. Similarly all&#13;
efforts have been made to ensure mixed ethnicity within the brigades. Emphasis is placed on this being&#13;
a community project, with equal participation from all elements of the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
7.     The FFW element is designed to relieve food deficits, and to foster local cooperation in shelter&#13;
reconstruction. The donated supply of basic construction materials, beyond the means of poor families&#13;
to acquire, is supplemented by a significant local contribution in labor and in finishing. Work groups&#13;
make use of local skills.&#13;
8.     The above strategy has been shown to be a popular and effective way to meet several needs&#13;
simultaneously: reinforced community organization and participation, shortage of construction materials,&#13;
and shortage of food and employment opportunities, particularly for unemployed skilled artisans and&#13;
unskilled labor. The seasonal work program meshes well with off-season work in canal clearing. The&#13;
specific steps to implement the strategy, explained further below under the section on implementation,&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)    Extensive village meetings are held to inform people of the project, undertake social&#13;
mapping, identify eligible and needy beneficiaries and particularly ensure the inclusion&#13;
of women, calculate FFW and material requirements;&#13;
(b)    Village work brigades are formed and a work plan prepared;&#13;
(c)    Materials and food are procured, and their delivery and utilization monitored both by the&#13;
local representatives and the NGO.&#13;
9.     Two new elements have been included in the strategy of this project in order to improve&#13;
effectiveness and coverage.&#13;
(a)    As a sub-component of the project a subcontractor would supply tiels and train local&#13;
carpenters and artisans in roof construction (which is slightly different from that required&#13;
for asbestos sheeting), quality control and repairs.  In order to demonstrate the&#13;
technology and determine training needs, three demonstration houses would be roofed&#13;
with tiles prior to project effectiveness. The use of roofing tiles in place of the&#13;
previously-used asbestos sheets would remove a potential health hazard, and support&#13;
additional employment that would disseminate this technology more widely.&#13;
(b)    Site visits and training will be arranged for a small number of selected community&#13;
representatives and government officials from other parts of the country where there is&#13;
an identified housing need (rural Penjikent, Aini, Mascho), with a view to building&#13;
capacity in other local organizations for similar programs. The addition of a small&#13;
training and extension component will enable the methodology to be adopted and adapted&#13;
to the needs of other areas where SCF-US does not work, and where similar housing&#13;
needs of the very poor exist for reasons other than destruction in civil war.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
ACTIVITIES&#13;
10.   Extensive village meetings would be held to inform people of the program modalities and its&#13;
limitations. Direct selection of the neediest areas is done initially from an already-prepared list of&#13;
beneficiaries, through community-based participatory social mapping, and consultation with other NGOs&#13;
working in the area and key community resource people (particularly informal leaders, neighborhood&#13;
(mahallah) community representatives) and local SCF-US staff to identify the neediest women-headed&#13;
households. These mechanisms will identify the neighborhoods of greatest destruction and/or poverty.&#13;
SCF-US organizers will work in pairs of one man and one woman, to promote women's participation and&#13;
assess the volume of reconstruction work (number of houses multiplied by the estimated percentage of&#13;
destruction). These organizers will also ensure, through spot visits and other means, that the beneficiaries&#13;
are indeed village residents, and that they have not received any free construction materials in the past&#13;
three years.&#13;
11.    SCF-US staff then calculate the food and material requirements. The material requirements are&#13;
calculated according to the annexed Technical Note 1, and the food requirements according to the&#13;
annexed Technical Note 2.&#13;
12.   Village brigades are formed (usually 15-20 persons), from the community members. Each&#13;
brigade elects a leader, and a detailed contract is formalized between SCF-US and the brigades (including&#13;
terms and conditions, details of each house owner and work to be done, and names of the brigade&#13;
members). Usually the brigade leader enters into a contract with the village executive committee for the&#13;
provision of transport. The establishing of such a relationship is hoped to encourage the extension of&#13;
official participation to include further negotiated contributions from their own resources towards minor&#13;
repair works of community benefit (e.g. repair of street lights).&#13;
13.    Roofing materials (tiles and timber) will be procured by International Competitive Bidding, except&#13;
for the requirements for the first two hundred houses which will be procured by Direct Contract and&#13;
International Shopping respectively. The materials will remain under SCF-US control from receipt to&#13;
delivery upon the brigade's completion of preparatory reconstruction work (to wall-plate level). The&#13;
delivery of the materials and food is authorized upon receipt of a satisfactory post-survey report prepared&#13;
by SCF-US. The brigade is responsible for organizing the transport and distribution of the items to the&#13;
respective beneficiaries. This process is rigorously monitored and documented fully by SCF-US.&#13;
14.   Food is released and distributed according to specified procedures against work done (historical&#13;
average is 210 kg. of food per house, consisting of 90 kg. wheat flour, 90 kg. beans, and 30 kg. edible&#13;
oil). House construction is seasonal (March to November), and food distributed for completed housing&#13;
is targeted to reach the beneficiaries during the most critical pre-harvest period of food shortages. (Note:&#13;
SCF-US's FFW activities continue for canal cleaning and war rubble clearance during the non-&#13;
construction period of the year under a program financed by USDA independently of this Shelter&#13;
program.&#13;
15.   In order to demonstrate the technology and determine training needs, three demonstration houses&#13;
were roofed with tiles prior to project start-up, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiles. Site visits&#13;
and training will be arranged for a small number of selected community representatives and government&#13;
officials from other parts of the country where there is an identified housing need (i.e. rural Penjikent,&#13;
Aini, Mascho), with a view to building capacity in other local organizations for similar programs.&#13;

16.    The schedule of activities is listed in Table 1. The following notes explain more precisely what&#13;
is the content of such activities, if not clarified above. (a) Hire staff: the staffing requirements, local and&#13;
international, are detailed under management below. Local staff are hired on contract for the duration&#13;
of the project; (b) Train staff: staff will be trained in the SCF-US methodology, including social&#13;
mapping; (c) Social mapping: this is an additional activity to ensure that the lists provided by officials&#13;
are objective identifications of poverty areas and poorer households. The maps will be prepared in&#13;
participatory fashion, and used for subsequent monitoring and programming; (d) Post survey: normally&#13;
it takes between three weeks to one month to construct a house, and brigades usually work on several&#13;
houses at a time. The post survey is a verification by SCF-US staff that the construction has been&#13;
satisfactorily completed, and is the basis for approval of distribution of commodities.&#13;

MANAGEMENT&#13;
17.   Overall management of the project would be the responsibility of the SCF-US Field Office&#13;
Director (FOD) in Tajikistan. The Program Officer (1) is responsible for overall monitoring and&#13;
reporting. Two Supervisors would collect and finalize the lists of needy families, identify the most&#13;
vulnerable, and supervise project implementation in the field. Ten Organizers are responsible for&#13;
monitoring the progress of construction and for supervising food and materials distribution. Necessary&#13;
support staff include: accountants (2), data entry clerks (3), computer specialist (1), secretaries (3),&#13;
logistics assistants (2), store keeper (1), warehouse keepers (2); drivers (2), guards (12), and cleaners (3).&#13;
Total full-time national staff costs are less than 6 percent of the entire project costs (excluding value of&#13;
food and local contributions).&#13;
18.   The project requires the part-time support of international staff whose costs are charged to the&#13;
project in proportion to their time allocation (time sheets are kept). The Field Office Director (FOD)&#13;
(20%), assisted by the Deputy FOD/Program (35%), is responsible for overall performance of the&#13;
project, delegation of duties, recruitment, performance and discipline of staff, and reporting to donors&#13;
and the Government of Tajikistan. The Deputy FOD/Administration and Finance (10%) is responsible&#13;
for financial management, monitoring, reporting and procurement. The Program Director (40%) and&#13;
Program Manager (20%) are responsible for the actual implementation and for all data management&#13;
requirements of the project, and for the MIS (already developed).&#13;
19.   SCF-US has operated in Tajikistan since 1994 under an agreement with the government and in&#13;
close cooperation with USDA, USAID and UNHCR. The proposed project would build on an area in&#13;
which capacity and experience has already been demonstrated. With over 160 staff, the organization has&#13;
mobilized over 18,000 people to rebuild their villages, and has ensured targeting of women and&#13;
accountability of transactions at village level.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
20.   The project rehabilitates ruined structures in existing habitations, where families are returning to&#13;
their former houses. The result is significant improvement in the built environment, with no adverse&#13;
impacts on the natural environment.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
21.   Sustainability of impact is built into the project, as the significant improvements to shelter would&#13;
remove a key constraint to income generation for poor families and enable them to concentrate on&#13;
productive investment of time; it would also have a positive impact on family health and therefore on&#13;
productivity by reducing overcrowding and improving living conditions.&#13;
22.   Sustainability of process is limited. The project strategy is a "rehabilitation" mode, mid-way&#13;
between relief and development, and is facilitated by external provision of food for work and building&#13;
materials. In some cases work groups have continued on their own dynamic, and they often participate&#13;
in further poverty alleviation and reconstruction activities (e.g. Group Guaranteed Lending, canal cleaning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
and rubble clearance). but for the foreseeable future, until there is a substantial increase in local food&#13;
production and local security, most are likely to continue to rely on external inputs for some years to&#13;
come. The activity of reconstruction in Tajikistan depends almost entirely on external provision of food&#13;
for work, and scarce reconstruction materials. Unless the project continues, the remaining deficit of&#13;
4,000 houses, together with those of newly returned families, will only very gradually be rehabilitated.&#13;
23.    Outside the project area, the express aim would be to generate a sustained impact of process&#13;
independently of the project, although links with TASIF would be required to sustain this process on any&#13;
significant scale, especially in poor and marginal areas.&#13;
LINKS WITH TASIF&#13;
24.    It is expected that the work groups and village committees would  be informed  through this&#13;
Project and encouraged to develop proposals for co-financing self-help micro-projects. The training&#13;
and extension component is designed explicitly to generate capacity in other regions (e.g. eastern&#13;
mountains, Leninabad districts).&#13;

25.    The budget above summarizes main line items by source. The total costs of the project would&#13;
include the following:&#13;
(a) Community Contribution. Community  contribution  in labor for actual reconstruction work&#13;
is compensated through the FFW mechanism, which is not less than the local prevailing daily&#13;
rate for unskilled labor. In addition to the food compensation, the community/house owner will&#13;
contribute in terms labor and locally available material. Such contribution is estimated to be&#13;
$188,000 for the whole project. Community contribution is estimated to be nine labor-days for&#13;
roofing and 35 labor-days for finishing the house. Material contribution from the house owner,&#13;
for the ceiling, windows and doors, is estimated to be $50 per house. The community and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
house owners also contribute in many other ways, the total value of which is difficult to cost:&#13;
(i) selection of beneficiaries, social mapping, monitoring; (ii) negotiation with village authorities&#13;
for transport and other requirements: (iii) distribution of materials and food (under supervision).&#13;
(b) Village Executive Committees: The Village Executive Committees (grassroots level government&#13;
structure responsible for development activities in the village) are responsible for providing SCF-&#13;
US with lists of potential beneficiaries, and assist in carrying out surveys, calculating&#13;
distributions, and providing transport for the food and materials from SCF-US warehouses to the&#13;
community.&#13;
(c) USDA. USDA will provide 420 MT of food commodities, with a local market value of&#13;
approximately $261,600 (based on July 1996 market prices), and $131,760 for associated&#13;
handling costs. The contribution from USDA is calculated as a proportion of food to be used in&#13;
this project. Food calculation is based on SCF-US's existing norms of 210 kg. per house,&#13;
assuming an average of 75 % destruction.&#13;
MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
26.    Key indicators would be monitored by the Program Officer with participation from brigades. All&#13;
key indicators would be monitored monthly and reported quarterly.&#13;
27.    Quantitative&#13;
(a) Beneficiaries/poverty monitoring: number of reconstructed houses benefiting (i) families with&#13;
many children; (ii) widows; (iii) families with orphans; (iv) pensioners; (v) female-headed&#13;
households;&#13;
(b) Number/proportion of women participating in construction brigades: (monthly during construction&#13;
period);&#13;
(c) Number of houses reconstructed;&#13;
(d) Quantities of construction material distributed;&#13;
(e) Quantities of food distributed, and approximate labor days equivalent.&#13;
(f) Using information collected from points (c)-(e), determine the average inputs per house&#13;
constructed (used for forward planning, costing, and efficiency control). In addition, monitoring&#13;
is carried out by random unannounced visits.&#13;
Oualitative&#13;
(g) Construction quality and load-bearing capacity of walls and roofing must be adequate for tiles,&#13;
a material whose use is not well-known locally. Special efforts will be made by SCF-US and SNI&#13;
to ensure that all structures are adequate, that standards are maintained, and that roofing&#13;
performance under different conditions (rain, snow, high winds) is assured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
(h) A simple assessment of the contribution of housing to poverty alleviation (household standard of&#13;
living) will be undertaken, through post-reconstruction visits and individual/group interviews.&#13;
Local communities will be involved in this component.&#13;
Key Objective&#13;
(i) The program will also participate in the Project-wide monitoring of key objective indicators that&#13;
will measure progress toward the major objectives poverty impact and institutional capacity.&#13;
28.   Implementation, monitoring and financial reports will be forwarded quarterly by the FOD to the&#13;
officer designated by GOT. Quarterly reports will assess progress against targets, identify any reasons&#13;
for exceeding or shortfall of targets, and indicate consequent action already taken or to be taken. In case&#13;
of significant change to the implementation schedule, exceptional reports shall also be submitted to GOT.&#13;
INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
29.   An independent integrated evaluation at mid-term and project completion would be contracted by&#13;
TASIF to be undertaken by a consultant leading a multi-disciplinary team of local and international&#13;
experts. Implementing INGOs including SCF-US would each nominate a team member, but the team as&#13;
a whole would evaluate all aspects of both components of the project including the SCF-US Shelter&#13;
program. The team would visit project sites, review reports and indicator measurements in the light of&#13;
its own observations and investigations, and seek to establish lessons to be learned both at mid-term and&#13;
for Project follow-up. It would report both to TASIF and to the Bank. Further details are in Annex L.&#13;
30.   Key objective indicators will be measured and monitored by the Project in order to track, in a&#13;
consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives. The key objective&#13;
indicators are summarized in Table 1 of Annex L. The first Project objective of impact on the incomes&#13;
of the poor will be measured across all sub-components by five key indicators, of which two will indicate&#13;
the extent to which this objective has been met in a cost effective and participatory fashion. In addition,&#13;
each sub-component will be evaluated according to three specific indicators relating to the particular&#13;
program. For the Shelter program these three specific indicators are: shelter; vulnerable groups&#13;
benefiting; and technology adoption (tiles). These indicators measure impact, coverage and sustainability.&#13;
The second Project objective of capability building would be measured by two general indicators across&#13;
all components, with a third relating specifically to the training of TASIF staff. Thus each sub-&#13;
component will be evaluated on ten indicators, of which seven are common to all sub-components of the&#13;
Project, and three are specific to each sub-component.  These indicators, and the specific measures and&#13;
instruments to compile them, would be refined in a pilot baseline exercise.&#13;
31.   Monitoring and evaluation activities have already been a prominent feature of the existing NGO&#13;
Shelter program, and both the findings and systems used will be built upon in the scaled-up program.&#13;
The Project would closely monitor the scaled-up program. Specifically, SCF-US would be asked to&#13;
report to the TASIF on a quarterly basis on the following: (i) summary of achievements: number of&#13;
beneficiaries reached (direct and indirect) versus goal; cost per beneficiary (total NGO program cost&#13;
divided by number of beneficiaries); labor content as a percentage of the NGO program budget; number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
of person-days of employment generated; and operating costs as a percentage of the NGO program&#13;
budget; (ii) obstacles and issues to be overcome and resolved; (iii) targeting; (iv) community participation;&#13;
(v) financial reporting; and, (vi) sustainability. Each of the NGO programs would also have a monitoring&#13;
schedule based on its specific characteristics (see paras. 28-30). In addition to this the SCF-US will&#13;
report to TASIF on achieved targets in the Shelter program in order to trigger release of payments by&#13;
TASIF to SCF-US. After receiving an Advance of 10% the second third ad fourth payments will be&#13;
released based on the following achieved outputs: second payment of 40% when three demonstration&#13;
houses have been completed and five hundred houses have been completed; third payment of 40% when&#13;
an additional 600 house have been completed; and the last payment of 10% when the remaining 900&#13;
houses have been completed&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS&#13;
32.   Major assumptions and risks include ensuring transparency and appropriate beneficiary selection,&#13;
ensuring the timely supply and monitoring the flow of a large volume of goods, ensuring quality and&#13;
performance of tile manufacture, and ensuring food quality and quantity. Assurance of food quality and&#13;
quantity available for FFW is required. In case of delays in delivery, or of food stocks approaching&#13;
their expiry date, SCF-US would negotiate an exchange of stocks with WFP or any other agency dealing&#13;
with commodity delivery in Tajikistan. Details of food quality control are given in Technical Note 3.&#13;
33.   Food For Work activities historically run the risk of distorting food market prices and depressing&#13;
local production. However, given the anticipated shortfall locally and nationally over the next two years,&#13;
this danger appears minimal. Regardless of such a forecast, SCF-US monitors local market prices of&#13;
food regularly, and will propose appropriate action should the FFW activities proposed here at any time&#13;
appear to be an inappropriate mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
34.   The program assumes that the dissemination of tiles technology will be successful. This requires&#13;
not only the procurement of materials, but the training of local artisans in roof construction, tiling, quality&#13;
control and repair. This risk is justified by the need to depart from the use of asbestos sheet roofing, and&#13;
will be mitigated by continued close contact and collaboration between SCF and the contractor&#13;
throughout the duration of the project.&#13;
CONDITIONALITY&#13;
35.   The program funding is conditional to the stipulations set out and agreed upon in the legal&#13;
agreement between TASIF and SCF-US.&#13;

Technical Note 2: Food Requirement Calculation&#13;
36.    There will be labor compensation of the reconstruction work through food (Food for Work). In&#13;
order to complete the target of 2,000 houses, 180 MT of wheat flour, 180 MT of pinto beans and 60 MT&#13;
of vegetable oil will be required. SCF-US still has approximately 5,000 MT of USDA 1995 food&#13;
available, and is expecting an additional 6,000 MT under their USDA 1996 grant. The ration to be&#13;
distributed for Food for Work program beneficiaries will be wheat flour, pinto beans and vegetable oil.&#13;
It should be noted that the individual commodities may change, depending upon actual receipt from&#13;
USDA. The ration scale will be adjusted accordingly.&#13;

Note: The value of the food commodities is calculated on average July 1996 market prices for the commodities: Wheat flour -&#13;
$ 0.54; Pinto beans - $ 0.52; and Vegetable oil - $1.18&#13;
The extent of destruction of houses ranges from 20% to 100%. Food calculation is based on an average&#13;
destruction rate of 75 % per house. Depending upon the quantity of different food commodity received,&#13;
necessary adjustments will made for the individual commodities to be distributed per house.&#13;
Technical Note 3: Food Quality Assurance&#13;
37.    The following steps are taken to ensure the food quality:&#13;
(a) On a semi-annual basis, commodity samples are taken by the doctor in the district hospital, who&#13;
will then analyze the food quality and certify whether the food is fit for human consumption..&#13;
(b) In the case of damaged bags, a similar testing is performed before the reconstitution is done.&#13;
(c) Warehousing facilities are fumigated with Bromistic methyl (45 gm/cum.) every six months.&#13;
After every fumigation, the fumigation company is responsible for performing the analysis of&#13;
commodity samples and providing a certificate concerning its fitness for human consumption.&#13;
It should be noted that food is generally not kept more than six months. This implies that there&#13;
will be only one fumigation required per tranche.&#13;
(d) In the event that food has been stored more than six months, SCF-US collaborates with other&#13;
humanitarian agencies who are in need of food for immediate distribution. SCF-US will loan the&#13;
needed quantity of commodities, and same quantity will be repaid to SCF-US once the other&#13;
agency's fresh stock comes.&#13;
(e) Food certified as unfit for human consumption is given to animal, fish or poultry farms.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
MICRO-CREDIT PROGRAM (SAVE THE CHILDREN-US)&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The proposed program will focus on women in war-affected regions of Tajikistan to achieve in&#13;
two years the following specific objectives: (a) provide access to credit and mobilize savings for 3, 750&#13;
women in the Bokhtar, Vaksh, Vose, Kurgan-Tube and Kolkhozabad districts of Khatlon Region; (b)&#13;
generate additional income for 3750 people in the Bokhtar, Vaksh, Vose, Kurgan Tube and Kolkhozabad&#13;
districts of Khatlon Region; (c) positively impact approximately 18,750 children and other dependents&#13;
of the original 3750 borrowers; (d) develop the Group Guaranteed Loans and Savings (GGLS) program&#13;
into an independent local NGO or financial services institution that can operate independently within four&#13;
years a micro finance program that sustains access capital for poor women. The program is currently&#13;
operating in Kurgan-Tube, Bokhtar, Vaksh and Kolkhozabad districts of Western Khatlon. The proposed&#13;
expanded GGLS program will include Vose District. The existing program has been operating for over&#13;
one year. The expanded program will be for a period of two years and will begin in April 1997 and&#13;
continue until April 1999. It will be implemented by Save the Children-US.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    Over 800,000 people were displaced from the war in 1992-93. The homes of more than 25,000&#13;
families were destroyed and those who fled lost all or most of their productive and household assets. The&#13;
800,000 displaced, particularly the 25,000 families who lost their homes, constitute the largest single&#13;
vulnerable group in Tajikistan today. In addition areas like Khulyab face extreme lack of economic&#13;
opportunities. Particularly poorer section of the community are facing extreme hardship for their&#13;
livelihood. It is crucial that they have the opportunity to reestablish their productivity.&#13;
3.    The social, political and economic upheavals of the last few years have precipitated the final&#13;
disintegration of an already dysfunctional institutional infrastructure. At present the Government of&#13;
Tajikistan does not have comprehensive policies for civic groups or rural banking institutions, restricting&#13;
the development of both.  The presence of arbitrary and obstructive tax policies further restrict&#13;
opportunities for people to create indigenous structures that would help protect and provide for&#13;
themselves. Government is not able to provide access or education to encourage alternative sources for&#13;
opportunities like small business development. Formal banks are not reliable and do not provide access&#13;
to credit for poor women. The lack of collateral among poor women, returnee refugees and internally&#13;
displaced people (IDPs) forces would-be entrepreneurs to enter high risk relationships for credit with&#13;
black market lenders. Poor women, returnee refugees and IDPs have no institutional structure other than&#13;
their equally depressed families and friends to assist on their livelihood. Most people receive little or no&#13;
cash for the work they perform for the collective farms and businesses. Alternative sources of income&#13;
and services are necessary for people to provide for their basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
4.    The population now has a disproportionate gender and age composition. Many men were killed&#13;
in the war leaving behind women, children and the elderly. Historically in Tajikistan men have the&#13;
greater access to jobs for cash. However, the present circumstances create a great demand for capital&#13;
among women. Without access to credit and an active earning member in the family, life for the&#13;
remaining members has been very difficult. Even though women want to work to earn a living, they are&#13;
limited in their income generating activities due to a dearth of skills. The expanded program will provide&#13;
the essential capital for this otherwise alienated population through its proposed GGLS and provide&#13;
technical support so that women can improve and broaden their skills.&#13;
The specific objectives of the expanded program are the following:&#13;
(a) Sustainable reduction of poverty through the provision of access to credit and mobilization of&#13;
savings for 3,750 women in the Bokhtar, Vaksh, Vole, Kurgan-Tube and Kolkhozabad districts&#13;
of Khatlon Region.&#13;
(b) Generation of additional income for 3,750 people in the Bokhtar, Vaksh, Vose, Kurgan Tube and&#13;
Kolkhozabad Districts of Khatlon Region.&#13;
(c) Positive impact on approximately 18,750 children and other dependents of the original 3,750&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
(d) Development of the GGLS program into an independent local NGO or financial services&#13;
institution that can operate independently within four years a micro finance program that sustains&#13;
access capital for poor women.&#13;
(e) Development of common ground and bringing people together for their mutual benefit.&#13;
STRATEGY AND TARGETING&#13;
5.    The current strategy focuses on construction brigades and women's committees. Members in&#13;
brigades have the experience of working together which is considered to be a good way to initiate GGLS&#13;
groups. Initially, based on group interest and SCF-US's experience with a number of these brigades in&#13;
their present GGLS program, additional brigade members will be selected to participate in the GGLS&#13;
activities. If there is not an adequate number of women from the house building brigades in the same&#13;
localities to make a GGLS group, women who have not participated in the reconstruction may participate&#13;
in the savings and credit program. In order to be a member of the group the following criteria will be&#13;
used:&#13;
(a) Female (however, GGLS will experiment with a few male or mixed groups);&#13;
(b) From a poor family;&#13;
(c) Living permanently in the community;&#13;
(d) Only one member from a family is permitted and;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(e) Must possess some skills or experience relevant to proposed business activity.&#13;
6.     As a pilot test a few men's groups will also be formed and progress will be assessed based on&#13;
the achievement of the pilot test group expansion strategy will be determined. The number of groups in&#13;
the expanded program is shown below:&#13;

ACTIVITIES&#13;
7.     The average group size will be fifteen. All GGLS groups will organize themselves for a series&#13;
of meetings with SCF -US- staff to ensure that all the members of the groups are clear about their&#13;
responsibilities and expectations that they have of SCF (US). In these initial meetings the groups will&#13;
agree and commit to a written set of GGLS bylaws for the group including leadership selection. These&#13;
bylaws will include policies and procedures to ensure the long term sustainability and transparent&#13;
accountability of the groups loans funds.&#13;
8.     In order to build up capacity, the different training programs will be done at two different levels:&#13;
for national staff and for local institutions.&#13;
(a) Training sessions for national staff will focus on: GGLS theory; sustainability and how to achieve&#13;
it; how to present GGLS in the community; the role of the promoter; group formation and&#13;
bylaws; training in group dynamics; internal (group) savings and external accounts; first and&#13;
subsequent loan cycles; increasing loan amounts with each cycle; GGLS accounting, program and&#13;
financial reporting.&#13;
(b) For the local institutions, training will be given to those interested in leading an apex NGO. This&#13;
training will be based on a training needs assessment, and is likely to cover topics such as&#13;
leadership, management, accounting, recording keeping, credit management, market survey, and&#13;
new business creation. . The apex NGO will work as a micro credit institution and will give all&#13;
technical assistance required by the groups within five years of the start date of proposed&#13;
activities.&#13;
9.     The existing NGO capacity building project (which is a collaborative project of SCF-US and the&#13;
Counterpart Consortium) will assist project staff in designing different training programs. Through this&#13;
project, several of the SCF-US staff will be trained in Institutional Capacity Building. They, in turn, will&#13;
train other staff or members of micro-credit institutions. As needed, interested borrowers and members&#13;
of local NGOs will also be admitted to the training program conducted by the NGO Capacity Building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Training team. Training will be offered at the SCF-US's two training centers in Kurgan-Tube and&#13;
Dushanbe.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
10.   Accessibility to Credit and Savings. SCF-US will allocate to each group loan money from its&#13;
revolving fund budget. The group will approve its members' loans on the basis of the feasibility of the&#13;
economic activities proposed by the applicant, and the group's judgement of the applicant's ability to&#13;
implement the proposed activities and repay the loan. As there is no collateral in the group lending&#13;
program, therefore the group will guarantee repayment if the borrower in its group defaults. If a group&#13;
does not repay the loan when it is due that group's access to the loan money will be cut off or be&#13;
suspended until and unless due repayment is made. Groups that perform well will receive more loan&#13;
fund allocations from the GGLS program. As the group gains experience and performs well, the amount&#13;
of subsequent individual loans will increase as individuals develop their entrepreneurial capacity.&#13;
11.   Savings will be an important component of the program. Saving serves as an indicator of profit&#13;
and commitment. The GGLS program will require clients to save on a weekly basis, which will total&#13;
three percent of the loan in a cycle. However, program participants will be encouraged to save more.&#13;
Group savings perform many functions, including servicing as a guarantee for defaults and being available&#13;
for future capital expansion. Group participants will be encouraged to open individual or group saving&#13;
accounts once the banking facilities will be available in the working area.&#13;

12.   All 3,750 members will get loans in four three-month cycles. The loanee must repay the&#13;
previous cycle before getting the next. Upon the formation of the group, members will sign a contract&#13;
as a group with SCF -US or with the partner institution (when formed) about holding regular bi-weekly&#13;
group meetings, making regular repayments and sharing a commitment to help each other in the group&#13;
in order to fulfill program rules. Upon acquiring membership every member will be issued a membership&#13;
card. Loan disbursements as well as repayments will be done in Tajik Rubles. For each cycle a&#13;
repayment schedule of six bi-weekly installments will be followed. Until an apex NGO is formed, SCF-&#13;
US project staff will handle cash transactions and deposit individual group loan repayments in an SCF-US&#13;
safe in the SCF-US office. For depositing large amounts of cash, commercial banking facilities will be&#13;
used. In the existing pilot program the first cycle started with TR 1,200 ($20) which increased to TR&#13;
5,000 ($30) in the second, TR 12,000 ($40) in the third, and TR 15,000 ($55) in the fourth cycle. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
the case of urban groups TR 6,000, 12,000, 15,000, and 18,000 ($30, $40, $55, and $65 respectively)&#13;
were disbursed in 1-4 cycles respectively.&#13;
13.    At the close of the first year of the project 3,450 loans will be disbursed to 1,500 members.&#13;
Disbursed loans will be protected by 100 groups, averaging 15 members per group. In each of the first&#13;
and second quarters of the first year, 20 groups will enter the first loan cycle. In subsequent quarters&#13;
of the first year, 20 groups will enter the first loan cycle. In subsequent quarters of the first year, 30&#13;
groups will enter the first loan cycle. Similarly in the second year, 30 groups in each of the first and&#13;
second quarters and 45 groups each in the last two quarters, will enter the first cycle of the loan. Upon&#13;
the successful completion of a loan cycle, at the end of each quarter, groups will enter a new loan cycle&#13;
and will remain constant once they reach the fourth cycle. The Implementation Plan matrices below shows&#13;
the number of groups in each loan cycle in each quarter and their advancement into the next loan cycle;&#13;
the loan portfolio per quarter; loans repayments per quarter with 2% loan loss; and savings generated&#13;
from he forced savings of 3 percentage points of the 13% interest rate charged on loans per repayment&#13;

MANAGEMENT&#13;
14.    The GGLS program will be supervised by a Program Advisor Manager (expatriate consultant).&#13;
He or she will be responsible for assisting with the design, implementation, supervision and overall&#13;
management of the GGLS program and will train the local staff to take over his or her duties after two&#13;
years. The program manager will be responsible for the GGLS unit office in Kurgan Tube and for&#13;
overall management of the program operations. The Program Manager will supervise the assistant&#13;
managers, who will be in charge of record keeping and financial management. They will be responsible&#13;
for the satellite offices in Kurgan Tube and Vose, and for the program operations through these offices.&#13;
A Monitoring and Training Officer will be responsible for the design and installation of the monitoring&#13;
system, and for training the staff of partner institutions to monitor the credit program. Group promoters&#13;
(who are the front-line of the GGLS program) are in charge of group formation, disbursing and collection&#13;
of loans, and savings mobilization, and they are supervised by unit supervisors, who are responsible for&#13;
record keeping in individual passbooks and for supervising the collection and disbursement activities.&#13;
The groups are organized with 15 to 20 members each, with a chairperson, a vice chairperson and a&#13;
secretary. Support staff (accountants, secretary, and drivers) will assist with the regular functioning of&#13;
the credit operation and management of the institution. In addition, GGLS staff will have the benefit of&#13;
support from the SCF/US Field Office Director, Assistant Director, and Assistant Field Office Director&#13;
for Finance and Administration.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
15.   The project will have no adverse impacts on the environment. The maximum size of the loan is&#13;
100 and ill be used mainly for trading activities.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
16.   The Micro Credit Group Guarantee Loans and Savings program aims to develop the existing&#13;
program into a sustainable local NGO or financial services institution that can operate independently&#13;
within four years and can sustain the access to capital for poor women. Within two years from the start&#13;
date of this upscaled project a core group of borrowers and GGLS staff will begin participating in SC&#13;
sponsored training and will produce an agenda for the development of a local apex institution that can&#13;
fully operate a micro credit program within four years. Various operating responsibilities related to the&#13;
GGLS program will be handed over to the clients groups through the four year period as their capacity&#13;
dictates. In the fourth year of this program groups receiving credit and savings services will be managed&#13;
and monitored by this apex NGO. Furthermore, in the fourth year of this program the apex NGO will&#13;
be provided a one time grant to run the credit and savings program and establish links to other&#13;
organizations so that its members can access more resources. The GGLS program will also be linked,&#13;
through the monitoring and evaluation process, to the TASIF according to the operational manual&#13;
guidelines. This will enable a strengthening of institutional replicability and sustainability. To address&#13;
the issue of financial sustainability, savings will be an important component of the project. Savings&#13;
serves as an indicator of profit and commitment as well as sustainability. The GGLS program will&#13;
require clients to save on a weekly basis which will total 3% of the loan in a cycle. Group savings&#13;
perform many functions, including serving as a guarantee for defaults and being available for future&#13;
capital expansion. Group members will be encouraged to open individual or group savings accounts once&#13;
the banking facilities are available in the area. All 3750 group members will get loans in 3 month cycles.&#13;
At the close of the first year of the project 3450 loans will be disbursed to 1500 members. Disbursed&#13;
loans will be protected by 100 groups, averaging 15 members per group. In the first and second quarter&#13;
of the first year 20 groups each will enter the first loan cycle. Similarly in the second year 30 groups&#13;
each will enter the first loan cycle. Similarly, in the second year 30 groups each in first and second&#13;
quarters and 45 groups each in last two quarters will join the first cycle of loan. Upon the successful&#13;
completion of a loan cycle in the end of each quarter groups will enter a new loan cycle and will remain&#13;
constant once they reach the fourth cycle. Repayments of loan with interest from the first year will be&#13;
revolved for continued funding in subsequent years. the proposed loan funding will allow all groups to&#13;
reach the forth loan cycle and continue receiving loans indefinitely provided additional funding is secured&#13;
to pay portion of the program costs. SCF estimates the program will be 6 % operationally self sustainable&#13;
a the end of the first year and 27%, 72% and 144% at the end of the second, third and fourth years&#13;
respectively with standard interest charge of 10% to which 3% will be added to make the total service&#13;
charge 13%. However the 3% will be deposited in groups names and will remain as the savings for the&#13;
group. Groups will have full authority in the utilization of the savings fund.&#13;

Client assessments (will be based on a survey of a sample group of clients, composed of one client&#13;
from each group):&#13;
At the six month evaluation the survey would be of 40 clients, one picked from each of the 40&#13;
groups. A total of 40 clients to be surveyed.&#13;
At the one year evaluation the survey would be of the 40 clients and in addition 60 from each one&#13;
of the 60 groups formed. A total of 100 clients to be surveyed.&#13;
At the one and a half year evaluation the survey would be of the 100 clients and in addition 60&#13;
clients from each of the 60 new groups formed. A total of 160 clients to be surveyed.&#13;
At the two year evaluation the survey would be of the 160 clients and in addition 90 clients from&#13;
each of the 90 new groups formed. A total of 250 clients will be surveyed.&#13;
The survey would ask the following questions.&#13;
What is the size of the loan borrowed?&#13;
What would the loan be used for?&#13;
How much revenue is earned from the loan?&#13;
Is the loan ever used for purpose other then business activity? If so, for what? nd how often has&#13;
this happened?&#13;

repay)?&#13;
How much savings?&#13;
Has client withdrawn savings? If yes, then for what use?&#13;
INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
20.   An independent integrated evaluation at mid-term and project completion would be contracted by&#13;
TASIF to be undertaken by a consultant leading a multi-disciplinary team of local and international&#13;
experts. Implementing INGOs including SCF-US would each nominate a team member, but the team as&#13;
a whole would evaluate all aspects of both components of the project including the SCF-US GGLS&#13;
program. The team would visit project sites, review reports and indicator measurements in the light of&#13;
its own observations and investigations, and seek to establish lessons to be learned both at mid-term and&#13;
for Project follow-up. It would report both to TASIF and to the Bank. Further details are in Annex L.&#13;
21.   Key objective indicators will be measured and monitored by the Project in order to track, in a&#13;
consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives. The key objective&#13;
indicators are summarized in Table 1 of Annex L. The first Project objective of impact on the incomes&#13;
of the poor will be measured across all sub-components by five key indicators, of which two will indicate&#13;
the extent to which this objective has been met in a cost effective and participatory fashion. In addition,&#13;
each sub-component will be evaluated according to three specific indicators relating to the particular&#13;
program. For the GGLS program these three specific indicators are: active portfolio; household incomes;&#13;
and productive enterprises. These indicators measure impact, coverage and sustainability. The second&#13;
Project objective of capability building would be measured by two general indicators across all&#13;
components, with a third relating specifically to the training of TASIF staff. Thus each sub-component&#13;
will be evaluated on ten indicators, of which seven are common to all sub-components of the Project, and&#13;
three are specific to each sub-component.  These indicators, and the specific measures and instruments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
to compile them, would be refined in a pilot baseline exercise.&#13;
22. Monitoring and evaluation activities have already been a prominent feature of the existing GGLS&#13;
program, and both the findings and systems used will be built upon in the scaled-up program. The Project&#13;
would closely monitor the scaled-up program. Specifically, SCF-US would be asked to report to the&#13;
TASIF on a quarterly basis on the following: (i) summary of achievements: number of beneficiaries&#13;
reached (direct and indirect) versus goal; cost per beneficiary (total NGO program cost divided by&#13;
number of beneficiaries); labor content as a percentage of the NGO program budget; number of person-&#13;
days of employment generated; and operating costs as a percentage of the NGO program budget; (ii)&#13;
obstacles and issues to be overcome and resolved; (iii) targeting; (iv) community participation; (v)&#13;
financial reporting; and, (vi) sustainability. Each of the NGO programs would also have a monitoring&#13;
schedule based on its specific characteristics (see paras. 18-19). In addition to this the SCF-US will&#13;
report to TASIF on achieved targets in the GGLS program in order to trigger release of payments by&#13;
TASIF to SCF-US (see para 25).&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS&#13;
23.   Assumptions are that the security situation will remain stable and that the economic crisis will&#13;
not worsen which will allow clients to continue to repay and borrow loans on time and steadily add to&#13;
their savings accounts. The rate of inflation it is assumed will continue to decrease or stabilize. Along&#13;
with the risk of defaults due to a deterioration in the social and economic conditions, there is the existing&#13;
risk of harassment of GGLS's clients by militia who charge exorbitant rates of illegal fees from market&#13;
vendors and often confiscate their goods. Added to this risk of theft from clients is the risk of theft from&#13;
GGLS staff or from the GGLS office of loans and savings funds. Banking facilities in the program area&#13;
are non-existent therefore cash amounts need to be hand carried to and from Dushanbe to Kurgan Tube&#13;
and then to and from clients to GGLS offices.&#13;
24.   The program funding is conditional to the stipulations set out and agreed upon in the legal&#13;
agreement between TASIF and SCF (US). Key steps which need to be taken prior to contract signing&#13;
have been agreed upon with SCF US for the GGLS program. Of those listed below key steps such as&#13;
introduction of savings concept to all existing groups, the implementation of savings with existing groups&#13;
and the revision of the application form to include socio economic baseline data on clients has been&#13;
initiated as of September 1996. The conditions for signing the contract are as follows:&#13;
(i)  Initiation of recruitment process of Project Advisor, Project Manager, Assistant Project&#13;
Manager, eight group promoters, two supervisors and one monitoring and training officer by&#13;
contract signing date.&#13;
(ii) Revision of Application form to include key social-economic baseline information on group&#13;
members.&#13;
(iii) Introduction of savings concept to existing groups and Implementing savings with e x i s t i n g&#13;
groups.&#13;
&#13;

25.   Funding for the program will be released in four payments by TASIF equaling to 10%, 40%,&#13;
40% and 10%. The first 10% will be an advance, the following payments will be based on achieved&#13;
outputs. The schedule for achieved outputs and release of payments from TASIF to SCF-US are as&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
PROGRAM OF SUPPORT TO FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS&#13;
(SAVE THE CHILDREN UK)&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The proposed program will focus on female-headed households in Western Tajikistan (Vaksh,&#13;
Aini, Panjkent, Dushanbe and Shaartuz Districts). It will assist 3,700 of the most vulnerable households,&#13;
and build the capacity of up to 16 local organizations by providing practical experience in effective&#13;
approaches to poverty alleviation. The program will have two components: (1) Support to Vulnerable&#13;
Households in Khatlon Province, which will reach 2,100 female-headed households with agricultural&#13;
inputs and social services; and (2) Capacity Building for Poverty Alleviation, which will strengthen 16&#13;
local government and non governmental organizations and reach up to 1,600 female-headed households&#13;
with appropriate community-centered poverty alleviation activities.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    Levels of household poverty are high and increasing through out Tajikistan, and the most&#13;
vulnerable groups are suffering the direct consequences in ill health, poor nutrition, inadequate housing&#13;
and lost opportunities for education. Household incomes have fallen as a result of dramatically reduced&#13;
opportunities for employment and access to resources for self employment is very limited. Compounding&#13;
the problem of household poverty is the collapse of the basic health and education services, due to the&#13;
central government's inability to finance them adequately. Access to health care for the poorest has been&#13;
severely curtailed by the rising cost of treatment as well as supply shortages. Local response to this&#13;
situation is hampered by the lack of experience and capacity within both local government and NGOs to&#13;
understand and respond to the needs of vulnerable households. This is due in part to a inadequate&#13;
knowledge and skills concerning practical approaches to poverty alleviation among staff of local&#13;
government and NGOs.&#13;
3.    In Khatlon Province, the Districts of Vaksh and Bokhtar, where SCF (UK) has been working&#13;
since 1994, were among those most seriously affected by the civil war. There are a large number of&#13;
vulnerable households - many of which are female headed and thus face considerable social as well as&#13;
economic obstacles. SCF's experience in the area indicates the importance of addressing all these issues,&#13;
including in particular the decline in educational and child care services, and the need for access to other&#13;
social services.&#13;
4.    The objectives of the project are ensure that a total of 3,700 most vulnerable households gain&#13;
access agriculture assets and social services such as day-care centers and schools, and to build local&#13;
capacity of 16 local organizations to deliver such services. The project consists of two main components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
Component 1: Support to Vulnerable Households in Khatlon Province&#13;
5.    This component builds on the experience of SCF (UK) in working with female-headed households&#13;
in Bokhtar/Vaksh districts, and has the following objectives:&#13;
*  to increase levels of household income for 2,100 vulnerable households by July 1999,&#13;
through the provision of agricultural assets such as livestock, seeds and tools as well as&#13;
technical advice;&#13;
*  to strengthen local capacity to support day-care centers and schools serving 30 villages, by&#13;
establishing community based mechanisms for the management of grants and revolving funds&#13;
generated by agriculture inputs;&#13;
*  to promote access to available services and resources through the dissemination of&#13;
information and advice, group formation, and legal support to vulnerable h households&#13;
indirectly to the population of 30 villages.&#13;
Component 2: Capacity Building for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
6.    In order to start extending poverty alleviation activities beyond Khatlon province, and to test the&#13;
applicability of project approaches in other circumstances the aim of this component is:&#13;
C to enable up to 1600 vulnerable households in four areas of the country to achieve higher&#13;
levels of self reliance and greater access to income support;&#13;
* to improve the capacity of selected local organizations (government and non-government) to&#13;
identify and support appropriate community centered poverty alleviation activities.&#13;
STRATEGY AND TRAINING&#13;
7.    The program will provide productive assets to individual female-headed households, in order to&#13;
improve household food security and, where possible, generate a family income through the sale of&#13;
produce. SCF's experience indicates that this approach can be successful, provided that support&#13;
appropriate and based upon adequate consultation with beneficiaries about the scale of assistance and the&#13;
nature of assets to be provided. The introduction of a revolving fund element makes such participation&#13;
even more important.&#13;
8.    It has also become apparent that to achieve sustained impact across the full range of problems&#13;
faced by vulnerable households, poverty alleviation activities must also address social and other non-&#13;
economic obstacles, and that this requires support to organization at the community level over a period&#13;
of years rather then months. Community level organization is the major challenge in introducing this&#13;
approach in other areas.&#13;
9.    While continuing to ensure the appropriateness of material inputs distributed to individual&#13;
households, SCF (UK) will seek ways to improve the overall quality of the productive assets provided.&#13;
In rural areas this will include research into the feasibility of introducing improved wheat and potato seed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
(particularly imported varieties). Different approaches will be developed in urban districts covered under&#13;
the local capacity building component.&#13;
10.   Field staff will play a critical role in all project activities, through informing vulnerable families&#13;
about their rights as well as about existing services and assistance programs. For example, experience&#13;
has shown that explaining the land reform process and the mechanisms for applying for land, as well as&#13;
following up on households requests for land with local and national authorities, can result in significant&#13;
benefits.&#13;
ACTIVITIES&#13;
Component 1: Support to Vulnerable households in Khatlon Province:&#13;
11.   In Vaksh District, SCF(UK) will identify 30 villages with a high proportion of vulnerable&#13;
(particularly FHH) households. These villages will be located around local schools and day-care centers.&#13;
Based on the level of productive assets and social conditions of each household SCF (UK) will classify&#13;
vulnerable families according to criteria which have been developed for the ongoing project.&#13;
12.   By the end of July 1997, two lists of FHHs will be identified by SCF field workers. The initial&#13;
700 FHH will form groups of 20 to 30 households. Each household will receive productive assets&#13;
according to their level of need up to a maximum equivalent to $150 per household. All households will&#13;
receive inputs on condition that they undertake to repay the equivalent value in cash or kind. The&#13;
repayment rate will be set at between 100 and 120 percent over a period to be determined by the SCF&#13;
(UK) depending on local conditions.&#13;
13.   Most of the funds repaid will be used to provide similar assistance to the second list of 700&#13;
FHHs, and as these receive their material inputs, a third group of up to 700 vulnerable households (some&#13;
of which may not be female headed) will be identified to receive assistance once further funds are&#13;
available.&#13;
14.   Any balance of repaid funds will be provided to local schools or day-care centers. These funds&#13;
will be managed by a committee including representatives of vulnerable households, other parents, pupils,&#13;
teachers and local authorities. The committees will be supported by an SCF (UK) field worker.&#13;
15.   Support to schools and day-care centers will also include one-off grants (possibly in the form of&#13;
food for work for staff) as well as assistance in the formation of community management boards and in&#13;
the continuing management of income from he local revolving funds.&#13;
16.   An integral part of all this work will be the dissemination of information. Field workers will&#13;
promote group formation, provide advice and legal support, and help to mediate with local authorities&#13;
and service providers.&#13;
Component 2: Capacity building for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
17.   This component will develop practical skills among staff of local government and non-government&#13;
organizations. It is expected that these organizations will work at the community level to assist vulnerable&#13;
families in the identification of pilot projects which focus on income generation and improved access to&#13;
essential services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
18.   Potential local partners will be identified from among local government agencies and NGOs in&#13;
Aini, Panjkent, Dushanbe and Shaartuz to implement small scale poverty alleviation projects targeted at&#13;
vulnerable households. The role of these partners organizations will be critical to the success of this&#13;
component and will require close monitoring and support by SCF (UK) staff to ensure that projects are&#13;
appropriate and targeted to vulnerable households.&#13;
19.   Training will be provided for potential partners in the above-mentioned regions in participatory&#13;
approaches to needs assessment, project appraisals and design, implementation and monitoring.&#13;
Perspective partners will then be invited to submit proposals for small-scale poverty alleviation projects&#13;
targeted at approximately 100 vulnerable households. Targeting criteria as well as levels and forms of&#13;
material assistance will be based on SCF experience in Khatlon, but may vary slightly depending on local&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
20.   On the basis of proposals received, SCF (UK) will select up to 16 small-scale pilot projects&#13;
(approximately four in each of the four regions), for implementation over a two-year period.&#13;
Disbursement of funds and monitoring of implementation will be accompanied by further training and&#13;
exchanges of experience among partner organizations and SCF as well as other interested agencies.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
21.   See attached implementation plan.&#13;
MANAGEMENT&#13;
22.   Overall management of the project will be the responsibility of SCF (UK)'s program manger for&#13;
Tajikistan based in Dushanbe. Day to day operations will be managed by a project manager based in&#13;
Khatlon with support form the program administrator for procurement and logistics as well as financial&#13;
monitoring, and from the training coordinator for local capacity building.&#13;
23.   In addition to national and international staff SCF (UK) will draw on the services of advisors and&#13;
consultants for specific areas of work.&#13;
24.   SCF (UK) activities in Tajikistan from part of its Central Asia program managed by the program&#13;
director based in Tashkent. Support to the Central Asia program is provided by the South Asia desk in&#13;
SCF London and by the Kathmandu advisory office.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
25.   Major environmental concerns in Khatlon province include the impact of intensive cotton&#13;
cultivation, management of solid wastes, growing environmental health problems, and deforestation.&#13;
26.   Environmental considerations will be incorporated into the assessment and monitoring of both&#13;
components of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
27.   Sustainability may be considered at three levels:  the household, community and service&#13;
institution. The program aims to deliver rapid support to vulnerable households, as well as to build the&#13;
capacity of local institutions to provide such support in the future. At the household level, the&#13;
implementation of this pilot will assist in establishing the criteria for sustainability, including: the levels&#13;
of support necessary to make a significant impact on welfare; the level and rate of repayments which&#13;
households can maintain; the levels of technical support and training required to make full use of material&#13;
inputs; and the implications of technical inputs for household resource (in particular labor) allocation.&#13;
28.   At community level, intensive training of group leaders and management committee members will&#13;
be undertaken in order to ensure the cohesion of FHH groups and school/day-care management structures,&#13;
and their continued role in supporting vulnerable households.&#13;
29.   At the institutional level, the project will work closely with TASIF ad individual ministries and&#13;
other participating agencies in order to learn jointly the lessons of implementation and contribute to&#13;
national capacity.&#13;
LINKS WITH THE TASIF&#13;
30.   This is the key element in term of institutional sustainability for poverty alleviation. The&#13;
experience gained by this program will provide lessons applicable to TASIF. In order for these lessons&#13;
to be shared between SCF (UK) and TASIF a close working relationship will be established during&#13;
project preparation which will require the creation of informal and formal fora for collaboration at&#13;
national level. The monitoring and reporting mechanisms will be a major means of achieving this&#13;
objective.&#13;
BUDGET&#13;
31. The total budget is $1,031,744 for the Program: $423,497in Year 1, and $447684in Year 2 and&#13;

Capacity Building for Poverty  Indicators of impact on vulnerable households: as sub-&#13;
Alleviation in 4 Districts   program I&#13;
outside Khatlon&#13;
Indicators of improved capacity of selected local&#13;
organizations:&#13;
a. training&#13;
b. conducting baseline surveys&#13;
INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
33.    An independent integrated evaluation at mid-term and project completion would be contracted by&#13;
TASIF to be undertaken by a consultant leading a multi-disciplinary team of local and international&#13;
experts. Implementing INGOs including SCF-UK would each nominate a team member, but the team&#13;
as a whole would evaluate all aspects of both components of the project including the SCF-UK program&#13;
of support to female headed households. The team would visit project sites, review reports and indicator&#13;
measurements in the light of its own observations and investigations, and seek to establish lessons to be&#13;
learned both at mid-term and for Project follow-up. It would report both to TASIF and to the Bank.&#13;
Further details are in Annex L.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
34.    Key objective indicators will be measured and monitored by the Project in order to track, in a&#13;
consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives. The key objective&#13;
indicators are summarized in Table 1 of Annex L. The first Project objective of impact on the incomes&#13;
of the poor will be measured across all sub-components by five key indicators, of which two will indicate&#13;
the extent to which this objective has been met in a cost effective and participatory fashion. In addition,&#13;
each sub-component will be evaluated according to three specific indicators relating to the particular&#13;
program. For the SCF-UK support to female headed households program these three specific indicators&#13;
are: number of participating FHHs; household incomes; and household food productivity. These&#13;
indicators measure impact, coverage and sustainability. The second Project objective of capability&#13;
building would be measured by two general indicators across all components, with a third relating&#13;
specifically to the training of TASIF staff.    Thus each sub-component will be evaluated on ten&#13;
indicators, of which seven are common to all sub-components of the Project, and three are specific to&#13;
each sub-component.   These indicators, and the specific measures and instruments to compile them,&#13;
would be refined in a pilot baseline exercise.&#13;
35.    Monitoring and evaluation activities are already a feature of the existing support to female headed&#13;
households program, and both the findings and systems used will be built upon in the scaled-up program.&#13;
The Project would closely monitor the scaled-up program. Specifically, SCF-UK would be asked to&#13;
report to the TASIF on a quarterly basis on the following: (i) summary of achievements: number of&#13;
beneficiaries reached (direct and indirect) versus goal; cost per beneficiary (total NGO program cost&#13;
divided by number of beneficiaries); labor content as a percentage of the NGO program budget; number&#13;
of person-days of employment generated; and operating costs as a percentage of the NGO program&#13;
budget; (ii) obstacles and issues to be overcome and resolved; (iii) targeting; (iv) community participation;&#13;
(v) financial reporting; and, (vi) sustainability. Each of the NGO programs would also have a monitoring&#13;
schedule based on its specific characteristics (see para. 32). In addition to this the SCF-UK will report&#13;
to TASIF on achieved targets in the support to female headed households program in order to trigger&#13;
release of payments by TASIF to SCF-US (see para 39).&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS&#13;
36.    The greatest risk to the Program is the uncertain security situation which persists in some project&#13;
areas. To address this risk, the implementation plans will remain flexible to respond to any changes in&#13;
the local situation.&#13;
37.    The second risk relates to the limited capacity of local organizations to implement program&#13;
activities. Activities within the program itself are directed at increasing this capacity. In addition, to&#13;
address this risk the capacity of potential partner organizations will be assessed prior to implementation;&#13;
the number of such organizations will be limited; outreach activities will be limited to one hundred&#13;
households per organization.&#13;
A number of more specific risks could also affect the project:&#13;
(a) attempts or influence national staff recruitment: SCF (UK) has a policy of advertising all&#13;
posts, with standard application forms and interview records;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
(b) attempts to influence beneficiary selection: SCF(UK) has established and published criteria&#13;
for beneficiary selection;&#13;
(c) fluctuation in prices of agricultural inputs: SCF(UK) monitors market prices and, where&#13;
possible, ensures that purchases are made at the optimum time;&#13;
(d) harassment of national staff and beneficiaries during distribution; SCF(UK) approaches local&#13;
authorities in the project area before beginning project activities to request support and ensure&#13;
security;&#13;
(e) theft from warehouse or beneficiaries' homes or land; SCF(UK) ensures that adequate&#13;
security for warehouse facilities is provided and works with local authorities to resolve cases&#13;
of theft;&#13;
(f) disease of potatoes, wheat, vegetables and livestock: SCF(UK) will consult closely with&#13;
agricultural and livestock specialists and ensure that training and support are provided to&#13;
beneficiaries;&#13;
(g) attempts to influence school/day-care committees; SCF(UK) will monitor committees closely&#13;
and may withdraw support in cases where funds are misused.&#13;
38.   Payments by TASIF to SCF (UK) will be made in four tranches of 10%, 40%, 40% and 10%.&#13;
The first payment will be an advance payment of 10% of the total budget amount and will be made by&#13;
TASIF to SCF (UK) upon Credit effectiveness. Subsequent payments will be made to SCF (UK) by&#13;
TASIF based on the condition that achievable outputs agreed to in the legal agreement (appendix B) are&#13;
met. These are as follows:&#13;
Second Payment of 40% when:&#13;
700 vulnerable FHH identified&#13;
700 vulnerable households categorized&#13;
Group leaders appointed&#13;
Agriculture packages as defined by groups with procurement plans&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
AGRICULTURAL REFORM PROGRAM (AGA KHAN FOUNDATION)&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The Agricultural Reform Program  (ARP) is being implemented by the Pamir Relief and&#13;
Development Program (PRDP) in collaboration with the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) in the Gorno-&#13;
Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO), the mountainous region of eastern Tajikistan. Since its&#13;
inception in 1993, the program has grown more rapidly than anticipated, and PRDP has specific plans&#13;
for its significant expansion in the next few years in the areas irrigation and new land development. In&#13;
1997/1998 ARP will complete the construction of 32 gravity-flow irrigation channels (107 kilometers)&#13;
in six of GBAO's seven districts'' which will enable the cultivation of 3,877 hectares of new privately&#13;
managed land. Some 1,600 small resource farmers will participate. PRDP will provide technical advice&#13;
along with provision of improved seed, fertilizer, and other inputs on credit. In addition, the program&#13;
will furnish resources for PRDP's expansion through the development of district offices of the NGO.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.     Due to geo-political reasons, the region of GBAO has always been isolated from much of the rest&#13;
of Tajikistan. In spite of its isolation, the Soviets did establish an extensive system of collective (kolkhoz)&#13;
and state (sovkhoz) farms with centralized management. With little arable land and misguided decisions&#13;
of central planners, however, GBAO was heavily dependent upon imports from other regions of the&#13;
Soviet Union, and 80% of needed foodstuffs was brought in annually. After the collapse of the Soviet&#13;
Union in 1991, the residents of GBAO faced severe hardship and a widespread system of humanitarian&#13;
food distribution was established by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF). This continues today. The major&#13;
needs of the populace are the provision of food, along with the creation of employment opportunities.&#13;
Some 80% of the labor force is estimated to be unemployed. It is in this context that the Agricultural&#13;
Reform Program is especially relevant.&#13;
3.    By charter, AKF is a development institution and not a relief organization. Thus in 1992 it&#13;
established the first local NGO in GBAO, the PRDP (Pamir Relief and Development Program), which&#13;
has been active in increasing the production and productivity of the region's agricultural sector through&#13;
the ARP, along with continuing its humanitarian assistance.&#13;
1/ These districts include Darwaz, Vanch, Rushan, Shugnan, Roshtkala, and Ishkashim; only the district of Murghab is&#13;
excluded because its populace is largely pastoral.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
4.    The long-term goal of the ARP is to establish self-sufficiency in and reliance upon staple food&#13;
crops in GBAO through the fostering of increased efficiency and intensification of land use in an&#13;
environmentally sound way throughout the region. The basic objectives involved in the expansion of&#13;
ARP in GBAO for the coming years of 1997-1998 are as follows:&#13;
1. To expand the area under food crop production;&#13;
2. To increase food crop production and productivity;&#13;
3. To establish and support private farm management;&#13;
4. To develop human and institutional capacity in agriculture.&#13;
5.    The major targets to be achieved in the coming years include the following:&#13;
1997    1998    TOTAL&#13;
# channel systems&#13;
completed (within year)  19   13      32&#13;
# kilometers of channels&#13;
completed (within year)  31.8 km  76.0 km  107.8 km&#13;
# hectares of land brought&#13;
under cultivation&#13;
(within year)      325 ha   627 ha  952 ha&#13;
# hectares of land to be&#13;
brought under culti-&#13;
vation by 2004                    3,877 ha&#13;
6.    Focus will be upon small resource farmers throughout GBAO. Assuming that 1,600 farmers are&#13;
included in the program by 1998, and with an average family size of 8 persons, a total of 12,800&#13;
individuals will directly benefit from this expansion of ARP. The improvement in crop production and&#13;
the corresponding development of markets will in turn help all consumers of agricultural products in the&#13;
participating rural communities and in the region in general.&#13;
STRATEGY AND TARGETING&#13;
7.    PRDP works only with farmers who want to become (or have become) private farmers. Private&#13;
ownership of land is not important, but private management is. PRDP motivates farmers to negotiate&#13;
with the Government of GBAO for land (both previously cultivated and new plots) and assists them in&#13;
negotiating with kolkhoz authorities and district officials in order to obtain formal written contracts for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
private management which define and guarantee land access rights.z' Subsequently PRDP helps private&#13;
farmers by providing agricultural inputs (improved seed, fertilizer, and fuel) on credit, along with&#13;
technical advice and assistance in cropping and irrigation.&#13;
8.      Since ARP began, villagers' first and foremost concern has been the need to bring additional&#13;
lands under cultivation in GBAO.3' Thus the NGO decided to assist farmers in channel construction and&#13;
new land development. The specific strategy is as follows:&#13;
*   Villagers desiring PRDP assistance in channel construction and new land development must&#13;
first come together, agree to work on the channel, and discuss their plans.&#13;
*   The farmers form a group and elect a sardar (leader) who will be the primary negotiator with&#13;
both government and PRDP.&#13;
*   The group prepares a formal written request to the government. The sardar then negotiates&#13;
with the government officials and obtains permission in writing for the farmers in his group&#13;
to utilize the designated unused lands for private management once the channel is completed.&#13;
*   The PRDP Agronomy Supervisor must then visit the proposed new land and ascertain that&#13;
it has suitable potential for cultivation. The PRDP Irrigation Engineer must also visit the&#13;
land, ascertain that the channel construction is feasible, and calculate its cost.&#13;
*   PRDP finally signs a formal agreement with the farmers' group stating that it will help with&#13;
channel construction and land development (i.e. technical assistance and materials).&#13;
*   Villagers agree to provide all manual labor required for channel construction, which is&#13;
fostered by Food-For-Work financed by GTZ.&#13;
9.      PRDP does not target the poor per se. At present individual village households and communities&#13;
are quite homogenous in their needs and, as noted above, all of the residents of GBAO face severe&#13;
hardships. If, with time, communities and/or households become more stratified economically, PRDP&#13;
will re-examine its policy.&#13;
2/ The specific PRDP-related agricultural reform processes in the area of farm restructuring are consistent with the National&#13;
Government's land reform and farm restructuring program that is currently being implemented on a pilot basis in other parts&#13;
of the country and is supported by IDA's Agricultural Recovery and Social Production Credit .&#13;
3/ At present a total of approximately 13,000 hectares of land in GBAO is under cultivation, which include both kolkhoz&#13;
plots and PRDP-assisted privately managed lands. Grain yields from these fields fall far short of the necessary 30,000&#13;
metric tons of wheat annually required for GBAO, however, and rations continue to be distributed to all of the populace&#13;
with AKF assistance. An estimated 10,000 hectares of potential land for cultivation exists throughout the region which&#13;
presently lack irrigation sources. Although of varying quality, some 4,000-6,000 hectares exhibit very good potential for&#13;
wheat, barley, alfalfa, and potatoes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
ACTIVITIES&#13;
9.     The specific activities included here pertain to the four major objectives of ARP:&#13;
1. To expand the area under food crop production:&#13;
Activities:&#13;
a. increase the amount of land under food crop production;&#13;
b. establish new irrigation systems;&#13;
c. establish an intensive cropping system;&#13;
d. use Food-For-Work for irrigation channel construction and new land development.&#13;
2. To increase food crop production and productivity:&#13;
Activities:&#13;
a. supply agricultural inputs (improved seed, fertilizer, and fuel) on credit;&#13;
b. foster high-quality seed multiplication and seed distribution between farmers.&#13;
3. To establish and support private farm management:&#13;
Activities:&#13;
a. upgrade competence among farmers in negotiating with kolkhoz directors;&#13;
b. establish private farm management;&#13;
c. assist in establishing an open market and encourage sale of surplus produce.&#13;
4. To develop human and institutional capacity in agriculture:&#13;
Activities:&#13;
a. train PRDP staff to help private farmers negotiate agreements with the Government for&#13;
private use of land, conduct irrigation activities; provide    assistance in land&#13;
development;&#13;
b. train farmers in resource (water) and crop management.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
10.    By 1996 some 32 agreements had been signed by PRDP with the same number of farmers' groups&#13;
throughout GBAO; these range in size from 10-100 members.4' TABLE 1 contains a list of these groups&#13;
by district, which usually take the names of their respective village communities.&#13;
4/ Not all applications received by PRDP have been approved; a number of channels were found to be too expensive to&#13;
construct.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
11.    One irrigation channel is being constructed in each scheme.  These small-scale gravity-flow&#13;
channels vary greatly in length, with an average of approximately 7 kilometers. The sardar (elected&#13;
leader) organizes his fellow villagers to provide the manual labor and coordinates the work. The specific&#13;
hectarage to be cultivated when the channels are completed also varies greatly, with some supporting 5-10&#13;
individual plots of privately managed land while others servicing 70 or more.5'&#13;
12.    Since Spring 1996 a GTZ-funded Food-For-Work component has been established in ARP for&#13;
farmers participating in channel construction, and this has proved very successful.t' Individuals are&#13;
reimbursed with wheat flour according to the amount of work they complete. The PRDP Irrigation&#13;
Engineer initially calculates the number of person-days form the channel construction, with one day&#13;
entitling the worker to 500 grams of flour. After every 500 meters the work is evaluated and, if of&#13;
quality, Food-For-Work is&#13;
distributed.&#13;
13.    TABLE 1 contains detailed information about the ARP channel construction schedule in 1997-&#13;
1998. During 1997 construction will be undertaken in all 32 sites, and by the end of the year 19 channels&#13;
will be completed. During 1998 construction will continue in the remaining 13 sites.&#13;
14.    In each site the PRDP Engineer will supply necessary cement, tools, etc., to the local sardar.&#13;
The amount of these materials specific to the planned channel has previously been determined by PRDP&#13;
staff and is recorded by both PRDP and the sardar. During construction the sardar will coordinate the&#13;
manual labor, check how many people work on the channel each day, record individuals' names, and also&#13;
keep careful accounts of how much material is utilized. Materials are either stored at the sardar's house&#13;
or in another local storehouse. village groups often collect contributions from members in kind (wheat,&#13;
etc.) to pay skilled labor to run the tractors, compressors, etc., involved in construction.&#13;
15.    One PRDP staff member Engineering/Agricultural specialist) in each district will be responsible&#13;
for coordinating all of this work, and he will monitor each channel construction. Quarterly reports will&#13;
be filed with PRDP Headquarters concerning all channels in his respective district. Each 500 meters the&#13;
sardar will also take stock of who has worked on the channel and distribute Food-For-Work accordingly&#13;
(500 grams wheat flour per day of work).&#13;
16.    TABLE 2 presents PRDP's Land Development Activity Plan and pertains to the new plots to be&#13;
brought under cultivation following the completion of irrigation channels. A longer channel does not&#13;
necessarily mean that more land will be able to be cultivated; each system is specific to its own terrain&#13;
and land quality. A significant portion (952 hectares)Z' of the newly irrigated land will come into&#13;
production by the close of 1998. However, as TABLE 3 also illustrates, some plots of new land will not&#13;
be fully developed until 2004. A number of factors are involved here: length of channel and time&#13;
necessary to complete, time necessary to level and develop land, quality/fertility of the land itself, etc.&#13;
51 There is no direct relationship between length of channel and hectarage able to be irrigated. A comparatively short&#13;
channel may irrigate many plots of land, while a long channel may irrigate only a few.&#13;
6/ Reimbursement for work such as this is an important change, albeit small, from the extensive food ration system now in&#13;
place throughout the Pamirs.&#13;
7/ To date, some 109.5 kilometers of channels have already been completed, with a total of 215 hectares of new land having&#13;
been cultivated. These figures are also reflected in TABLE 2.&#13;

17.   PRDP will assist the farmers in the development of the new land which includes help and&#13;
guidance in leveling the land and construction of offtake channels from the main channel. The PRDP&#13;
Irrigation Engineer will also conduct assessments on water use for each system. The PRDP Agriculture&#13;
Supervisor and district office Agriculturalists will provide on-going ARP inputs: advice on what to grow,&#13;
land development, provision of improved seeds, fertilizer, and other inputs on credit (to be paid back in&#13;
cash or kind following harvest).&#13;
18.   Through discussions with participating farmers and analysis of land intended for irrigation, the&#13;
following distribution of crops is anticipated on the new plots:&#13;
70% wheat&#13;
10% barley&#13;
10% alfalfa&#13;
10% potatoes/vegetables&#13;
In general, the larger plots will be planted in grains, and the smaller in vegetables. Wheat will largely&#13;
be consumed by the producing household, while the other crops will be marketed.&#13;
19.   Planning workshops of one week in length for all PRDP staff involved in ARP will be held prior&#13;
to each cropping season in April and November. At this time progress to date will be reviewed,&#13;
techniques of negotiation with government and farmer will be improved, and new crops, seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
and other technical innovations to be included in the program will be discussed in detail. The status of&#13;
ARP will be reviewed district-by-district, with staff planning the coordination of land development and&#13;
other agricultural inputs for the newly irrigated plots.&#13;
20.    Staff will make frequent contact with the communities involved in ARP in their respective districts&#13;
and will continue to support the farmers to become active decision-makers in their agricultural activities.&#13;
PRDP intends to examine the dynarnics pertaining to village group formation and functioning vis-a-vis&#13;
channel construction. It will also continue to encourage those farmers who obtain surplus in their&#13;
harvests to sell such, and will provide assistance in transporting their surplus to market. Lessons learned&#13;
will be shared with staff, who will then encourage successful group formation and participation in other&#13;
PRDP undertakings.&#13;
21.    This expansion of ARP activities will be possible through the corresponding development of&#13;
existing PRDP district offices. Additional district staff will be hired, so that an Engineer, Agriculturalist,&#13;
driver, secretary, and storeman are present in each. In addition, the provision of office equipment (e.g.&#13;
telephone, chairs/tables, file cabinet, computer/printer, generator, etc.) will enable these units to function&#13;
more efficiently and successfully coordinate ARP work.&#13;
MANAGEMENT&#13;
22.    Management of this Agricultural Reform Program (ARP) is carried out in at PRDP Headquarters&#13;
in Khorog, GBAO, by PRDP's Deputy General Manager. Technical aspects of the project will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Irrigation Engineer and the Agricultural Supervisor, with assistance from the district&#13;
field staff (Engineer and Agriculturalist). AKF, with its office in Dushanbe and its new Program Director&#13;
in Khorog, plays a supportive role and provides guidance on a number of issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
1. PRDP has primary responsibility for the following:&#13;
a. implementation of ARP;&#13;
b. negotiations with local authorities and state farms for making land available for private&#13;
farming;&#13;
c. negotiations with individual or groups of farmers on agreements establishing the conditions&#13;
for provision by PRDP of agricultural inputs;&#13;
d. procurement of agricultural inputs and their distribution to contracting farmers;&#13;
e. verification of progress made under each agreement;&#13;
f. recruitment of PRDP program personnel and determination of conditions of employment&#13;
subject to agreed budgetary guidelines or limits;&#13;
g. preparing situation and implementation reports for AKF and donor agencies;&#13;
h. preparation of draft budgets.&#13;
2. AKF has primary responsibility for:&#13;
a. recruitment and terms and conditions of employment of consultants;&#13;
b. negotiating with PRDP management on the establishment of project budgets;&#13;
c. presentation of budgets to donor agencies;&#13;
d. provision of funds and payment of suppliers within agreed budgets;&#13;
e. financial control and auditing of PRDP accounts;&#13;
f. appointment of PRDP General Manager.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
23.   PRDP's activities are being implemented in an environmentally sound way. Staff is clearly aware&#13;
of the fragile nature of the Pamir ecosystem, and they act accordingly. The proposed ARP will not have&#13;
adverse effects upon the enviroinent:&#13;
*     The small gravity-flow irritation channels will result in only the re-routing of water,&#13;
which will then flow into the same mountain rivers as prior to channel construction.&#13;
*     Trees and other vegetation will grow along the channels (as encouraged by PRDP), and&#13;
these "vegetative breaks" will help to stop erosion.&#13;
*     Channels such as these have been similarly constructed in GBAO for centuries, and both&#13;
the local populace and PRDP engineers/agriculturalists are well-versed in the technology.&#13;
*     Land to be brought under cultivation is not on the mountain-sides but rather on the edges&#13;
of existing fields and in valleys.&#13;
*     No displacement of communities will be involved.&#13;
*     The project will give farmers even more incentive to manage water sources carefully in&#13;
a stress environment and encourages group formation and participation at the village&#13;
level.&#13;

This is based on production figures of 800kg/ha in the first year, rising by 200 kg/year to a maximum production of 2t/ha, the current average&#13;
of farmers in the ag reform programme. Value is calculated at $450/ton, whereas the current market rate in Khorog is $600/ton.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
*     Farmers must purchase fertilizers from PRDP (on credit) and thus excessive amounts are&#13;
not utilized in their privately-managed fields; in addition, PRDP staff guides their use&#13;
with care.&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
24.   At present the entire population of Gorno-Badakhshan is the recipient of AKF-sponsored food&#13;
rations. In this on-going system of extreme dependence, PRDP's activities in ARP are crucial. They&#13;
will enable more farmers to avail of privately-managed land. They will become active decision-makers&#13;
in agriculture, not only individually but also in the context of village groups. Seed quality and crop&#13;
yields will improve, local markets will develop, and the potential for sustainable agricultural development&#13;
in GBAO will increase.&#13;
LINKS WITH TASIF&#13;
25.   As ARP is implemented, links between AKF/PRDP and TASIF will be strengthened. Through&#13;
joint activities in monitoring and evaluation, the institutions will engage in joint problem-solving. In&#13;
addition, in coordination with TASIF, PRDP will host interested government officials from throughout&#13;
the country and NGO staff from throughout the country in order to observe PRDP's progress to date and&#13;
learn from its experiences.&#13;
BUDGET&#13;
26.   The total budget for the Agricultural Reform Program is US$656,016: US$217,044 in 1997,&#13;
US$285,274 in 1998, and US$153,698 in 1999. More details are included in Annex M.&#13;
MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
27.   The recent placement of an AKF Program Director in Khorog will allow for on-going monitoring&#13;
of PRDP's activities, including ARP. Monitoring of district field staffs work is accomplished by&#13;
periodic visits by PRDP staff from the Khorog office. A system of careful field reporting in the district&#13;
offices is already in place, and this will be continued and strengthened through the further development&#13;
of these offices. Records are kept on each of the 32 channel construction schemes including applications&#13;
and negotiations of the village groups, distribution of materials, and the progress of channel construction&#13;
and land development. District office staff will submit detailed quarterly reports in writing to the PRDP&#13;
Head Office in Khorog, where summary reports will be compiled. Quarterly reports are submitted to&#13;
AKF offices in Khorog, Dushanbe, and Geneva. AKF/PRDP will submit quarterly reports on ARP&#13;
progress to TASIF, and a final report will be submitted after the close of the program.&#13;
28.   The key indicators to be monitored are: the number of kilometers of channel construction which&#13;
has been successfully completed, the number of schemes completed, and the number of hectares of land&#13;
brought under cultivation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
29.   An independent integrated evaluation at mid-term and project completion would be contracted by&#13;
TASIF to be undertaken by a consultant leading a multi-disciplinary team of local and international&#13;
experts. Implementing INGOs, including AKF, would each nominate a team member, but the team as&#13;
a whole would evaluate all aspects of both components of the project including the AKF Agricultural&#13;
Reform program. The team would visit project sites, review reports and indicator measurements in the&#13;
light of its own observations and investigations, and seek to establish lessons to be learned both at&#13;
mid-term and for Project follow-up. It would report both to TASIF and to the Bank. Further details&#13;
are in Annex L.&#13;
30.   Key objective indicators will be measured and monitored by the Project in order to track, in a&#13;
consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives. The key objective&#13;
indicators are sununarized in Table 1 of Annex L. The first Project objective of impact on the incomes&#13;
of the poor will be measured across all sub-components by five key indicators, of which two will indicate&#13;
the extent to which this objective has been met in a cost effective and participatory fashion. In addition,&#13;
each sub-component will be evaluated according to three specific indicators relating to the particular&#13;
program. For the AKF program these three specific indicators are: channels completed and command area&#13;
realized; land area developed for production, households benefiting; and change in food productivity and&#13;
production. These indicators measure impact, coverage and sustainability. The second Project objective&#13;
of capability building would be measured by two general indicators across all components, with a third&#13;
relating specifically to the training of TASIF staff.  Thus each sub-component will be evaluated on ten&#13;
indicators, of which seven are common to all sub-components of the Project, and three are specific to&#13;
each sub-component.  These indicators, and the specific measures and instruments to compile them,&#13;
would be refined in a pilot baseline exercise.&#13;
31.   Monitoring and evaluation activities are already a feature of the existing agricultural reform&#13;
program, and both the findings and systems used will be built upon in the scaled-up program. The Project&#13;
would closely monitor the scaled-up program. Specifically, SCF-US would be asked to report to the&#13;
TASIF on a quarterly basis on the following: (i) summary of achievements: number of beneficiaries&#13;
reached (direct and indirect) versus goal; cost per beneficiary (total NGO program cost divided by&#13;
number of beneficiaries); labor content as a percentage of the NGO program budget; number of person-&#13;
days of employment generated; and operating costs as a percentage of the NGO program budget; (ii)&#13;
obstacles and issues to be overcome and resolved; (iii) targeting; (iv) community participation; (v)&#13;
financial reporting; and, (vi) sustainability. Each of the NGO programs would also have a monitoring&#13;
schedule based on its specific characteristics (see paras. 27-28). In addition to this, the AKF will report&#13;
to TASIF on achieved targets in the agriculture reform program in order to trigger release of payments&#13;
by TASIF to AKF. Payments from TASIF to AKF will be made in five tranches of 10%, 20%, 20%,&#13;
40% and 10%. The first payment of 10% will be an advance. The four subsequent payments will be&#13;
made against achieved targets which are given below:&#13;
End of June 1997: Second Payment of 20%&#13;
- First planning workshop for ARP staff held in April&#13;
- 6 district offices in the process of enlarging/strengthening (each being staffed with engineer,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
agriculturalist, secretary, storeman and driver; each being provided with telephone,&#13;
chairs/tables file cabinet, computer, printer, copy machine, heater and generator)&#13;
-  4 irrigation schemes completed (out of 19 for 1997)&#13;
-  Construction of remaining 15 irrigation schemes begun.&#13;
September 1997: Third Payment of 20%&#13;
-  8 irrigation schemes completed (out of 19 for 1997)&#13;
-  8 construction of remaining 8 irrigation schemes on-going&#13;
-  6 district offices completely enlarged/strengthened (each staffed with engineer, agriculturalist,&#13;
secretary, storeman and driver) (each provided with telephone, chairs/tables, file cabinet,&#13;
computer, printer, copy machine, heater and generator)&#13;
March 1998: Fourth Payment of 40%&#13;
-  Second planning workshop for ARP staff held (November)&#13;
-  19 irrigation schemes completed (total for 1997; or 31.8 kilometers of channels).&#13;
-  325 hectares of new land under cultivation (total for 1997)&#13;
-  7 irrigation schemes begun (out of 13 for 1998)&#13;
September 1998: Fifth Payment of 10%&#13;
-  6 irrigation schemes completed (out of 13 for 1998)&#13;
-  7 remaining schemes in on-going construction&#13;
-  Approximately 470 hectares of additional new land under cultivation (three-fourths of total&#13;
627 hectares for 1998)&#13;
ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS&#13;
30.    Humanitarian Aid: Presently the whole population of Gorno-Badakhshan receives humanitarian&#13;
aid from international donors in the form of food rations organized by AKF. It is assumed that this donor&#13;
assistance will continue (and slowly be phased out) as Pamiris move towards self-sufficiency in the area&#13;
of agriculture.&#13;
31.   Political Instability: Political instability on the road from Khorog to Dushanbe has led to its&#13;
periodic closing, the construction of numerous check-posts, etc. This has direct repercussions upon&#13;
Gorno-Badakhshan concerning transport, trade, etc. Relations between the Pamiri population and the&#13;
national government are also strained. In addition, the border with Afghanistan is tense. Risks of&#13;
conflict are constant, but it is assumed that stability will prevail and program activities will continue.&#13;
32.    Seasonal Variation: Another risk concerns the weather in Gorno-Badakhshan. It is assumed that&#13;
the seasons, rainfall, and other related conditions will not be harsh and that crops will be forthcoming.&#13;

ANNEX F&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY OF SOCIAL ASSESSMENTt'&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.      A Social Assessment (SA) was been undertaken in order better to understand the nature and&#13;
causes of poverty, its dynamics, and the context in which effective solutions may be developed. Although&#13;
the SA is best seen as a process of investigation, its central part is a field investigation conducted in May-&#13;
June 1996 in seven selected sites, to address the following key questions:&#13;
Poverty Profre:&#13;
3 Who is poor, where, how and why?&#13;
Livelihood strategies:&#13;
3 What are people doing?&#13;
3 How to meet their basic needs?&#13;
Elements for a response:&#13;
* What are local priority needs for poverty alleviation?&#13;
3 What is local capacity to organize for development?&#13;
3 What is the community assessment of existing NGO programs?&#13;
3 What are the implications for a Social Investment Fund?&#13;
2.      The field study method was based on Participatory Rapid Appraisal which seeks to document local&#13;
knowledge of problems and their solutions. Qualitative research was chosen in preference to quantitative&#13;
methods at this stage, because the rapidly changing situation in Tajikistan requires an understanding of&#13;
the dynamics of change before indicators can be developed for the study of quantitative aspects.&#13;
8/ The social assessment report was compiled and written by Ms E. Gomart, consultant to the World Bank, who also trained&#13;
and led the research team and analyzed the results of their findings. A research team of 11 Tajik nationals undertook five weeks&#13;
of intensive field work in May-June 1996, working extremely long hours and displaying a high level of commitment, a&#13;
willingness to learn new research techniques, and an ability to learn about conditions and trends in their country. The team&#13;
consisted of Mokhabad Akhmedova; Atoyev Kamol; Abdugafur Khaidarov; Khosanev; P. Kh. Khudaidadov; Shakhia Sh.&#13;
Patchadjanova; Maksuda Sanginovna; Firuz C. Saydov; M.H. Tursunov; Davlatmo Yusufbekova; Djema Yusupdjanova. Raisa&#13;
Mukhutdinova assisted with translation. Mark Waite led the research team in Gorno-Badakshan, and also edited and translated&#13;
the field reports. Government officials at all sites were generous with their time. International NGOs provided ample&#13;
information to a demanding schedule, and assisted the field team with logistics. Generous assistance in many ways was provided&#13;
by the Center for Strategic Research, the Aid Coordination Unit and the World Bank Liaison Office. Keith Rennie (EMTEN)&#13;
provided technical and editorial advice, and the task was managed by Michael Mills (EC3HR).&#13;
&#13;

POVERTY PROFILE&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
3.    Even before the war, Tajikistan was one of the poorest newly independent states of the former&#13;
Soviet Union. It inherited low levels of investment, an imbalanced pattern of industrialization, high&#13;
dependency on imported food, and weak social indicators (high malnutrition rates, low school attendance&#13;
of girls in most rural areas, high unemployment). Since independence in 1991, chronic poverty was&#13;
rapidly worsened both by the collapse of the union economy and by the civil war which caused an&#13;
estimated 25,000 deaths and 600,000 refugees and displaced people--mostly from Kurgan Tube region.&#13;
Although the civil war is said to have ended in October 1993, fighting erupts periodically and opposition&#13;
forces are active in the central-eastern part of the country: in the Garm Valley, and the pre-Pamir districts&#13;
of Darwaz and Vanj.&#13;
4.    Most households have been hard hit hard by the civil war and protracted political and economic&#13;
crises. As a result, security and rule of law are main priorities for the population. There is a widespread&#13;
desire for peace, for an end to forced conscription, improved security and increased rule of law. Political&#13;
and military meddling by outsiders is seen as a main impediment to normalization. Most people believe&#13;
peace may be achieved either by the coming to power of a third neutral political party, or by a coalition&#13;
government that will bring together all political factions.&#13;
B.    Who are the Poor?&#13;
5.    Some communities identified three socio-economic strata: the poorest households, those who were&#13;
average, and the rich. Other communities were more sharply divided between a few well-to-do families&#13;
and the rest of the population who were "spending their days running after a piece of bread". Some&#13;
effort was required to overcome initial reluctance to reveal socio-economic distinctions within a&#13;
community, and to cope with local perceptions of the possible motives of outside researchers.&#13;
6.    Informants identified the poor as those who, through a combination of adverse factors, are&#13;
struggling to put bread on the table. The poor are those who in the past relied the most on allowances&#13;
and other forms of subsidies during the Soviet Union. Poor families tend to have no working man; many&#13;
children (eight or more); no land, or just a small area often planted only with wheat; insufficient&#13;
agricultural inputs; and poor state of health. The poor include those families who rely overly on salaries&#13;
from the kolkhoz (i.e. the man works on the kolkhoz), social services or unskilled labor (e.g. cleaner).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
7.     The middle stratum of society includes those people who need to work hard and use all their&#13;
resources to make ends meet. They usually have at least two males of working age, and thus, in&#13;
comparison to poor families, have a higher ratio of males compared to females, children and elderly.&#13;
These families also have access to land which they are cultivating. They may hold two or more cows&#13;
(or one cow, plus sheep or goats). Cash remittances from family members working elsewhere are&#13;
important. Within this group, the households that are doing rather better are those that have a resource&#13;
cushion which they have been able to accumulate or to preserve. This cushion consists of savings (e.g.&#13;
cattle or capital), or productive assets (e.g. orchards or equipment) which allow the household to survive&#13;
a period of adversity. By contrast, most people who find themselves towards the bottom of this middle&#13;
stratum are conscious of the risk that they may fall into poverty. They are relatively poor and are able&#13;
to meet only the most basic food and clothing needs. The solutions that they have found to their&#13;
problems are vulnerable to being nullified at any time by corruption, insecurity, and market fluctuations.&#13;
8.    In general, the rich are those who have a link to the management of local industries, to local or&#13;
regional government, or to the security forces. In towns and large district centers, respondents perceived&#13;
that the rich gain a living not so much from their work itself, but through benefits obtained by virtue of&#13;
their position of employment. Another source of wealth is large remittances from Russia.&#13;
C.    Local Criteria of Poverty&#13;
9.    Communities identified the following indicators of relative poverty between households. These&#13;
are:&#13;
*  inability to provide basic household needs: food, shelter, shoes, health, education;&#13;
*  no labor, or insufficient labor, available at household level;&#13;
*  depletion of assets (cattle, personal property);&#13;
*  lack of access to productive assets;&#13;
*  lack of employment; and&#13;
*  lack of ties to the local ruling clan&#13;
D.    Basic Needs&#13;
10.   Many households were not able to satisfy more than basic food needs. The quality and quantity&#13;
of food available was usually assessed by the type of bread available for household consumption, since&#13;
bread quality corresponds closely to household incomes and access to cash and markets. This spring&#13;
(1996) many households had to eke out scarce supplies of wheat flour by mixing it with other grains--&#13;
maize, and even hay and cotton seeds. Some families had no wheat flour at all, and were using flour&#13;
which they made only from hay or other grasses. A few infants were said to have died of hunger in the&#13;
villages in the week preceding the survey, and many adults and children were extremely thin and faint&#13;
with hunger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
11.    Shelter is a need that cannot be met by many resettled households who have few assets and&#13;
sources of cash income. Shelter is also a problem for young families, and results in overcrowding in&#13;
single rooms and on plots for single households.&#13;
12.    The lack of children's shoes is the most often cited obstacle to school attendance. After food,&#13;
shoes are the next the main cash purchase that poor families make. Clothes are also needed among&#13;
recently displaced or resettled families who often have left their homes empty-handed.&#13;
13.    Poor access to health services was also an indicator of poverty, both because it implies reduced&#13;
capacity to generate income, and because it is associated with poor nutrition. Health services are&#13;
increasingly out of reach for the poor. Not only are medicines routinely sold, but doctors--especially in&#13;
towns--are charging for their services. In villages, doctors have so few resources that treatment is&#13;
commonly unavailable. The poor reported that increasingly doctors are turning away poor patients&#13;
because they cannot pay for care. As a result, most families try to turn to tabibs, traditional healers who&#13;
are found in most villages and towns.&#13;
14.   Poor access to education is linked to low incomes, as demonstrated through the lack of shoes,&#13;
winter clothes, supplies, transportation and reliance on incomes earned by children. Poor education&#13;
uptake also derives from the declining value of education in the eyes of parents, and to tradition which&#13;
limits attendance of girls over the age of 11. In urban areas, where schools collect money for repairs,&#13;
fees are also increasingly being charged by teachers. The exodus of teachers and decreased attendance&#13;
of teachers during the school day also jeopardizes the quality of education.&#13;
E.    Labor power&#13;
15.    Labor power is literally manpower, and refers to the number of healthy, grown men capable of&#13;
providing for the household. The criterion speaks to the felt reality of female-headed households:&#13;
*  women without husbands often lack the confidence to request officials for land, nor do they&#13;
receive the respect which would lead to the request's being granted;&#13;
*  strong workers are needed to clear boulders from reclaimed land;&#13;
*  the more male adults compared to the rest of the members of the household, the better off&#13;
the household;&#13;
*  work in the CIS is mostly physical work, such as construction and agricultural work, which&#13;
requites strong, healthy men.&#13;
16.    Manpower is threatened by forced conscription which keeps many young men out of the markets&#13;
and the fields, and by continued insecurity in areas of former conflict, which impedes the return of&#13;
husbands and grown men to these areas.&#13;
F.    Depletion of assets&#13;
17.    Cattle holdings in rural areas are a store for wealth. There is occurring throughout the country&#13;
a rapid and dramatic decline in cattle holdings of formerly "average" (two-cow) families, meaning a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
depletion of household savings. Cattle are being sold more rapidly than the rate of natural replacement&#13;
in order to purchase flour (especially during the spring) and medicines.&#13;
18.    The poor, especially displaced and resettled families and Russian pensioners in towns, are selling&#13;
their personal belongings, including refrigerator, furniture, dishes, blankets, and even the wooden floor&#13;
planks.&#13;
G.    Lack of access to productive assets&#13;
19.   Most people hope to cultivate land as a viable local source of income. Land use and leasing is&#13;
accorded by law to all rural residents. Land leases are meant to be long-term, with the crop to be&#13;
determined by the individual lease-holder. However, in practice access to land is determined less by&#13;
residence and more by other factors including: manpower in the household; profession (kolkhoz worker,&#13;
farm management, teacher or doctor); regional-ethnic group; availability of resources for cultivation;&#13;
quality, and distance of land relative to place of residence; and access to markets. Access to land and&#13;
the ability to cultivate it are often reserved for the well-to-do.&#13;
20.    The type of cultivation on household plots is a good indicator of resources available for income&#13;
generation and access to markets. Cultivation of presidential land which varies greatly in terms of&#13;
quality, distance from the village, water supply, etc., can also provide a view into resources -- material&#13;
or political to secure and cultivate a favorable plot. The type of land lease obtained by the household&#13;
may also reveal its standing within the kolkhoz. The common kolkhoz worker commonly receives one-&#13;
year lease for a comparatively small area (e.g. 1-5 hectares, or 100 apple trees) with a predetermined&#13;
crop, and a price to be determined on an individual basis at the time of harvest. The well-to-do lease-&#13;
holder receives a long-term lease (5-10 years) for a comparatively large area (5 to 600 hectares) with no&#13;
predetermined crop.&#13;
21.    Access to other types of productive assets such as equipment (tractors, trucks, buses and vans)&#13;
is also a good indicator of wealth. Mostly tractors are owned by rural residents, while mechanized&#13;
transportation, such as buses and vans, are rented from the city authority and require an agreement with&#13;
the town to operate.&#13;
H.    Employment&#13;
22.    In both urban and rural areas an important criteria of poverty is employment--not only its access&#13;
but its type. Heads of households working in the collective farm were considered the poorest. Doctors&#13;
and especially teachers in villages were also seen as poor. Those with employment which provides access&#13;
to materials and products that can be used or sold on the market were considered the best off--these&#13;
included enterprise, farm and government officials. Salaries also vary greatly between sectors. For&#13;
example, one farm director earns TR 13,000, and a policeman in Shakhristan, Leninabad region, was said&#13;
to make TR 20,000 per month, while the local teacher made on average TR 1,200.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
I.     Ties to the local ruling clan&#13;
23.     Access to resources for wealth may be a function of membership in a localized clan. Such clans&#13;
may dominate entire bureaucracies at the local and regional levels. The case of the village of Galadzor&#13;
in Vose was striking. One village consisted of "foreigners" originally from Hovalling. It was&#13;
systematically disadvantaged in relation to neighboring Vose-originated villages in the rest of the kolkhoz,&#13;
in respect of land distribution, availability of pasture land and employment opportunities as hired labor.&#13;
J.     Predisposing Characteristics: Rural, War-affected, and Isolated.&#13;
24.   Based on the above criteria we can conclude that three main characteristics render certain areas&#13;
liable to poverty: a rural situation, in contrast to an urban one; war-affected villages, and isolated&#13;
villages.&#13;
25.    Urban areas are less vulnerable to poverty because they present opportunities for employment as&#13;
well as access to markets. The poverty of some urban households may be no less deep than that of rural&#13;
ones, but it is less widespread. The most vulnerable in towns are Russians, and single pensioners, and&#13;
female-headed households without a bread winner. Among the poorest urban households were also those&#13;
headed by unemployed, unskilled men.&#13;
War affected villages are most at risk from:&#13;
-  a high proportion of female-headed families with low levels of man power and poor access&#13;
to land;&#13;
e  low levels of savings (cattle) that act as a buffer against hunger;&#13;
i  low nutritional status because of lack of means for cultivating cash crops, eroded assets&#13;
(cattle, personal goods), resulting in poor health status;&#13;
*  poor condition or lack of shelter because of destruction related to the war and erosion of&#13;
savings (construction materials, cash);&#13;
*  discrimination and lack of security which inhibits growth and affects particularly those&#13;
originally from Garm and the Pamirs;&#13;
*  low level of attendance of schools owing to low incomes and fear of reprisals.&#13;
26.   Isolated villages which are located over 10 km from an active market or which do not have a&#13;
tradition of cultivating cash crops have been hard hit hard by price increases and by the decrease in real&#13;
value of salaries. The situation was caused by the following factors:&#13;
* Land problems: non-use of Presidential Land; lack of access to leased land; squeezing of&#13;
small farmers off irrigated land by large lease-holders, and from access to pasture lands&#13;
* rapidly decreasing level of cattle holdings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
* lack of cultivation for market sales&#13;
* low level of access to education: affecting mostly girls over 12&#13;
* low level of health services provided in villages&#13;
27.   In these villages, a solution to the problem was not immediately visible and contributed to the&#13;
feeling of hopelessness.&#13;
LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES&#13;
28.    How do households and individuals cope with these problems? Throughout the different sites,&#13;
several trends were identified:&#13;
decreased consumption levels&#13;
diversification of income sources (away from salaries, and toward land cultivation)&#13;
increased participation of all members of the household (women, children)&#13;
increased incidence of begging for and stealing of food products.&#13;
29.    Some strategies are common to all situations, while others are more specific to different&#13;
situations.&#13;

A.    Common Livelihood Strategies&#13;
30.   Lower consumption: Reduced consumption is a strategy that has been adopted by the great&#13;
majority of households in Tajikistan to live through this crisis. Reduction in consumption has limited&#13;
expenditures ancd consumption of home produced goods to the basics. Food quantity and quality has been&#13;
affected. The use of corn or hay for bread, mentioned above, is one example. Households also reduce&#13;
purchases such as meat, oil and sugar to under 10 per cent of their budget. Ceremonies--such as&#13;
weddings and funerals--have also been curtailed so that poor families can conduct them.&#13;
31.   Support networks: Networks of support are very effective, whether these are based on relatives&#13;
or a wider community or neighborhood. For example one pensioner living alone in Dushanbe said that&#13;
she relied on her neighbors and relatives for 80 percent of her needs. Within households, the work force&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
as well as income are commonly pooled, making use of economies of scale and attempting to lower the&#13;
dependency ratio. In rural areas, all members of the household, including women and children,&#13;
participate in production.&#13;
32.    Humanitarian assistance is an essential source of food for poor households in the war-affected&#13;
areas and in Gorno Badakhshan.&#13;
33.   Remittances are a strategy common to both urban and rural areas with a tradition of sending men&#13;
abroad for seasonal jobs. It remains the main strategy for alleviating local unemployment, especially&#13;
among young men. Access to this strategy requires the following: a large village or nearby center to&#13;
facilitate transportation; a network of ethnic or regional contacts in the CIS; a local tradition of seasonal&#13;
labor; and some capital for placement fee, transport and initial expenses. While remittances provide the&#13;
main source of income to build up savings, to purchase assets and to rehabilitate war-affected villages,&#13;
they do not provide a reliable source of income to cover daily expenses, leaving families sometimes at&#13;
risk.&#13;
B.    Livelihood Strategies in Villages&#13;
34.    Land provides the most reliable source of income to rural households. However access to&#13;
sufficient land and essential inputs is limited. As a result, grain production from Presidential land and&#13;
household plots satisfies the needs of the household for only 3-6 months of the year. Consequently,&#13;
households need to diversify production to more lucrative produce which can be exchanged for grain.&#13;
Cash crops were principally sold in small amounts because of difficulties with transport and physical&#13;
security. Land leases, as seen previously, do not necessarily provide a good source of income. As a&#13;
result, farmers are also informally cultivating land: by planting pasture land, and by double-cropping on&#13;
leased land. For example, wheat is planted in leased orchards.&#13;
35.    Cattle sales is the main livelihood strategy of the poor in mountainous and isolated villages,&#13;
although it depletes a major asset. For those who are able to manage sales in such a way as to avoid this&#13;
danger, cattle trade can be an excellent source of income.&#13;
36.   Markets: Town markets are a place where rural residents sell home-produced fruits, vegetables,&#13;
milk products or meat either directly, or in bulk to a trader. Access to market is a is influenced by:&#13;
*  security;&#13;
*  distances between the village and the nearest market;&#13;
*  local production and demand for home produced goods;&#13;
*  costs of production and marketing;&#13;
* gender; and&#13;
*  access to transport (cart, tractor, truck).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
37.   In villages there are no proper markets. Urban based middlemen sometimes come to buy produce&#13;
in villages with trucks or cars. Itinerant salesmen also go from house to house to sell or barter goods.&#13;
38.    Trade and self-employment in villages consists of petty trade stalls, mostly operated by children&#13;
and young women; production of crafts and other sewing (women); renting out of machinery; and private&#13;
trading in cattle. Skilled labor in villages, such as carpenters, has additional opportunities for earning&#13;
incomes either locally or in other CIS countries. Unskilled labor from the villages travels to the towns&#13;
to compete for odd-jobs, or to work the land of large lease-holders. These opportunities are few and far&#13;
between, and cannot be a reliable source of income for a household.&#13;
39.    Salaries, especially rural salaries, rarely provide an important proportion of household income.&#13;
Already low, salaries have been considerably eroded by inflation, and in any case are rarely paid--in one&#13;
site, the latest payment was in 1995, while in another there has been no payment since 1994. Yet farmers&#13;
receive partial payments in kind. Small amounts of food, fuel wood or cotton stocks are the incentive&#13;
to work. Additional income generation activities are also available through the farm such as silkworm&#13;
production which is lucrative yet requires a lot of labor. Doctors and teachers receive such small salaries&#13;
that they are commonly considered some of the poorest in the village. Town and farm officials on the&#13;
other hand, as well as security or army personnel are well paid.&#13;
40.    Gathering of medicinal herbs is an additional source of income, especially for pensioners and&#13;
women. Yet it provides only small contributions to household income.&#13;
41.    Begging and stealing are common among villagers. One pensioner estimated that begging in&#13;
distant villages represents 15 percent of her income. Stealing food is another source of income which&#13;
is increasing in importance especially in the spring when people have run out of food. This is sometimes&#13;
done openly. Stealing fruit and other cash crops for sale at the market was also a main source of income&#13;
during Soviet times.&#13;
C.    Livelihood Strategies in Towns&#13;
42.   In towns the livelihood strategies differed greatly from those in the villages. The main trends in&#13;
livelihood strategies in towns and district centers were:&#13;
*  diversifying income sources from the main salary to other cash sources;&#13;
*  holding more than one salaried job simultaneously;&#13;
*  acquiring equipment, transportation or using acquired skills;&#13;
* involving all persons in the household in income generation (including children);&#13;
* links to agricultural production&#13;
43.    Salaried employment remains the preferred source of income for many urban residents, often&#13;
being supplemented by other activities (such as trading), earnings from odd jobs, or from salaries from&#13;
other formal employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
44.    While many salaries are low and often unpaid, the following are incentives:&#13;
* high salaries in certain industries or sectors (such as security);&#13;
* access to equipment, fuel and raw materials for sale or private production;&#13;
* associated privileges (housing, free utilities, kindergarten, polyclinic).&#13;
45.    Others have lost out in the crisis of salaries, particularly:&#13;
* teachers, health workers and other workers in social services;&#13;
* unqualified labor;&#13;
* workers in uncompetitive industries (i.e. those using raw materials purchased from abroad,&#13;
producing low quality products at high costs).&#13;
46.    Market activities: In the main towns, large markets attract goods from the surrounding area, and&#13;
also from Dushanbe and neighboring countries. Markets are considered to be the main source of income&#13;
for urban households. Most industry and social services employees were said to be also involved in&#13;
market activities, usually in petty or small trade, before or after their working hours.&#13;
47.    Access to the market is limited by:&#13;
* physical insecurity, which limits the scale of activities;&#13;
* military conscription, which keeps young men away from public places;&#13;
* cost of access to market as formal and informal fees to be paid to officials; and&#13;
* availability of start-up capital.&#13;
48.    Petty trading, where the seller resells goods from the central market to secondary markets,&#13;
provides only minimal amounts of daily income, depending on the scale of the operation. Usually all&#13;
family members are involved, with the adults purchasing goods and the women and children selling.&#13;
There is also small trade in goods stolen from factories or products made from materials obtained through&#13;
the place of formal employment. One woman estimated that 60 per cent of her income derives from&#13;
dresses she makes from materials stolen at the textile factory. Urban sellers also purchase agricultural&#13;
products in bulk from villagers in town or go to nearby villages to purchase goods in bulk. This is a&#13;
more viable source of income.&#13;
49.    Medium-scale trading applies to products procured from nearby countries, such as CIS, central&#13;
Asian republics, Pakistan, China, or the United Arab Emirates; or through intermediary markets such&#13;
as Termez, Dushanbe and Ura Tube. Women tend to trade in clothes and household appliances and to&#13;
travel by plane and bus for reasons of security. Men, on the other hand, tend to travel by road or rail&#13;
and to trade mostly in bulk quantities of food and fuel. The main obstacle to scaling up trade is the need&#13;
to secure protection and capital. As a result, certain groups are most likely to be involved in trading of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
imported goods, either because they have access to capital (e.g. Urgut Uzbeks) or links to the security&#13;
forces.&#13;
50.   Wage Labor: Daily wage labor is common in cities. Near the bazaars, large groups of 40-50&#13;
men from the town or from the nearby villages stand around hoping for offers of work. Men working&#13;
in factories also work as wage labor at week-ends or during their free time. Young boys and men also&#13;
stand around with carts waiting for a job.&#13;
PROJECT IMPLICATIONS&#13;
A.    Priorities, Resources and Opportunities&#13;
The main priorities for poverty alleviation are:&#13;
*  Peace, security and rule of law;&#13;
*  Improved ability to meet basic needs: food shelter, shoes, health education;&#13;
*  Diversity of income sources;&#13;
*  Access to productive assets to increase self-sufficiency and the ability to produce tradeable&#13;
goods.&#13;
51.   Peace, security and the rule of law: The desire for peace was widely expressed across the sites&#13;
surveyed. People believed that with peace, the economic and political situation would improve and so&#13;
would physical security. Physical and psychological insecurity is felt most acutely in war-affected areas&#13;
(Kurgan Tube and Garm) and by certain groups, namely Garmis and Pamiris. Women in these areas feel&#13;
particularly vulnerable without husbands or grown men to protect them. More general feelings of&#13;
insecurity, which were encountered in many regions from Shakhristan to GAO, also inhibit economic&#13;
rehabilitation and economic exchange and development. Police and border guards often demand bribes&#13;
or part of the produce being transported. Food security is adversely affected when armed men steal&#13;
harvests. Peace might also enable the borders with Uzbekistan to be reopened, and bring increased&#13;
market and job opportunities. The continued conflict and forced conscription also restricts the mobility&#13;
of young men who avoid public places. The lack of rule of law has had a major impact on resource&#13;
allocation, favoring ruling clans at the expense of others.&#13;
52.   Ability to meet basic needs. To assist the many households throughout the country that are&#13;
currently unable to meet their most basic food needs, the following types of activities are proposed:&#13;
*  Information dissemination about laws and regulations regarding resource allocation, especially&#13;
privatization, in order to improve people's knowledge of their own rights;&#13;
*  Material inputs (e.g. seeds, water systems) to assist the poor effectively to exploit those&#13;
resources to which they have access;&#13;
*  Material assistance to support families in meeting their immediate food and shelter needs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
Development of cash crops and other marketable products through the provision of capital&#13;
and material inputs to improve household incomes and therefore access to staples (flour) and&#13;
other cash-based needs.&#13;
53.    Diversification of sources of income. Diversification of household incomes from dependence&#13;
on inadequate salaries towards inclusion of an array of in-kind and cash incomes is the main trend in&#13;
livelihood strategies. It can be effectively supported through small-scale savings and credit schemes&#13;
targeted to the poor.&#13;
54.   Improved access to productive assets, such as land and cattle, is central to enable the poor to&#13;
provide for their own needs. Asset allocation that consciously enables their access by the poor, along&#13;
with support for the necessary inputs, will permit a more effective exploitation of these resources. A key&#13;
requirement is a system of allocation and access that provides long-term security of use and encourages&#13;
long-term investment.&#13;
B.    Local Institutions, Informal and Formal&#13;
55.    Local institutions are structures within which local resources for development can be mobilized.&#13;
Institutions working effectively to support households and communities are for the most part informal,&#13;
traditional, male dominated, and based on family relations or locality, and often have a religious element.&#13;
Formal institutions, such as the Women's Councils or Youth League, are center-based, hierarchical and&#13;
top-down.  The survey found that the presence and activities of the formal institutions in local&#13;
communities was not always as great as their representatives believed. Despite their limitations, a locally-&#13;
based participatory poverty alleviation strategy will have to take account of the limitations and potentials&#13;
of both informal and formal institutions and either work through them or at least ensure their passive&#13;
support.&#13;
56.    The extended family network, in a patriarchal society, centers on the male head of household,&#13;
his household and that of his sons. The clan which is based both on family and locality, includes the&#13;
immediate relatives of the male head of household.&#13;
57.    Neighborhood networks, based on the principle of residential origin, are the second major type&#13;
of local network. People who have neither family ties nor do they come from the same village or&#13;
neighborhood, are deemed "foreigners." Thus the historical demography of a neighborhood or village&#13;
is very important as a basis for understanding systems of resource allocation.&#13;
58.    The mosque, Mullah and elders are well respected, informal leaders in the community. The&#13;
Mullah and the group of elders can play an active role in programming through information dissemination&#13;
to the population; mobilizing resources for programs; monitoring quality and timely execution and conflict&#13;
resolution.&#13;
59.    Female counterparts to the Mullah--Bibikhallifah--are found both in towns and villages. Their&#13;
main role is the religious education of women and performing religious ceremonies with women. More&#13;
information is needed on other roles they play in communities of women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
60.   The Mahallah representative or Hudjain in villages is an informal leader elected by the&#13;
community. The representative acts as a liaison to the formal local government structures. This type&#13;
of local leader can be found in those areas not affected by the war. In GAO, it was found that the&#13;
Hudjain works through a council, including one woman.&#13;
61.    Representatives of formal institutions should not be expected to represent the communities since&#13;
they are appointed from above and often are new arrivals from a different region and/or sector. These&#13;
include: the town, district and regional representatives and farm officials. Other formal institutions such&#13;
as the Women's Councils, the Youth League, etc., were found to be operating, if at all, then at a smaller&#13;
scale than in the past. Since the demise of the Soviet Union, some of these had reformed as different&#13;
entities but retained old links, such as the Youth League (formerly the Komsomol--i.e. Communist Youth&#13;
League) which retains funding links to the Communist Party.&#13;
62.    The SA found considerable local support for a participatory style of development. Communities&#13;
would like to be involved program design. Elders are eager to play an active role in program monitoring,&#13;
mobilization of resources. Local monitors should be independent from government, particularly in&#13;
matters of resource allocation Information dissemination should be improved by using traditional leaders&#13;
(Mullah, elders) and publicity at communal centers.&#13;
C.    Implications for Regional Focus&#13;
63.    The current crisis and internal conflict has had different effects according to regions. The table&#13;
below summarizes the main characteristics, opportunities and resources, and suggests a tentative&#13;
prioritization by poverty criteria.&#13;
D.    Possible Social Investment Fund micro-projects&#13;
64.    A number of ideas for projects arose during discussions with local officials, and other community&#13;
members. Some of these have already been planned for or are partially constructed, others are programs&#13;
which would allow the community to adjust better to the current situation.&#13;
65.    The kinds of projects for which community proposals are likely to be developed are:&#13;
Social infrastructure&#13;
Waste water canal cleaning&#13;
Irrigation repair&#13;
Pump replacement&#13;
Small water and sanitation stations&#13;
Public baths and latrines&#13;
Small hydroelectric plants&#13;
Reconstruction of schools and health points, especially in war-affected or distant villages&#13;
Kindergarten repairs or construction&#13;
Reclaiming land: new irrigation canals, clearing rocks&#13;
Constructing community storage for fruits and vegetables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100-&#13;
Environmental Projects&#13;
Reforestation&#13;
Terracing&#13;
Flood and mud-slide prevention&#13;
Enterprise development&#13;
Investment in enterprises--processing of local products&#13;
Small loans to micro-enterprises&#13;
Employment for women&#13;
Small factories: shoes, food processing&#13;
Rebuilding of greenhouses for lemons&#13;
66.   Programs should be aware of traditional gender roles which often define activities in which&#13;
women are willing to take part. Frequently, married and unmarried women alike say that they are not&#13;
comfortable going to the market or working outside the village.&#13;
67.   Program design should not rely on unverified official representation of the needs and priorities&#13;
of the population. Officials are often new to the region and unfamiliar with or remote from popular&#13;
concerns. At the same time, the program should be aware of the sensitivities of officials, who may&#13;
perceive a poverty alleviation program as evidence of the failure of their policies and management; and&#13;
it should seek to develop their positive support.&#13;

ANNEX G&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
SOCIAL PROTECTION MEASURES SUPPORTED THROUGH THE AGRICULTURAL&#13;
REFORM AND SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
1.    The Agricultural Reforn and Social Protection Credit supports Government's efforts to improve&#13;
social programs in three specific areas by: (a) protecting social sector bud get allocations; (b) improving&#13;
the targeting of safety net expenditures; and (c) restructuring pension and social insurance programs.&#13;
PROTECTING HEALTH AND EDUCATION EXPENDITURES&#13;
2.    Since 1992, the education and health sectors have been severely impaired by the collapse in&#13;
Government revenues and expenditures. The combined share of GDP that was allocated to these two&#13;
sectors was 17 percent in 1992 and about seven percent of a much smaller GDP in 1995. As a&#13;
consequence, supplies are scarce, wage payments have been irregular, and highly qualified staff continue&#13;
to leave both sectors. School attendance is falling and indicators show a worsening of the nation's health,&#13;
especially in the rural areas. There is an urgent need for emergency measures in these two sectors,&#13;
including immediate efforts to improve the supply of textbooks and basic drugs. In the short-term, the&#13;
priority is to ensure that these sectors receive a reasonable share of the severely constrained budget.&#13;
Consequently, Government allocated a fifth of the 1996 budget to these two sectors -- 5.5 percent to&#13;
health and 14.5 percent to education.&#13;
TARGETING SOCIAL PAYMENTS: ALLOWANCES AND SUBSIDIES&#13;
3.    Historically, household allowances and public enterprise subsidies were unsustainably large (18&#13;
percent of GDP in 1994) and inefficiently delivered. Subsidies to public enterprises, which represented&#13;
about 13 percent of GDP in 1994, were a major part of the overall social protection system in Tajikistan&#13;
because they allowed consumer prices to be kept below the cost of production. The bulk of these&#13;
subsidies were for bread production (paras. 41 and 42), irrigation (para. 30), and transportation. To&#13;
protect the poor from liberalization of transport prices, the Government will explore options for the use&#13;
of transport vouchers for selected groups.The most important element of the social safety net in Tajikistan&#13;
is the bread compensation allowance. Tajik households consume a relatively high level of bread products.&#13;
Prior to May 1995, the Government provided a universal bread allowance of 1,800 Russian rubles for&#13;
each citizen (representing 4.5 percent of GDP in 1994). Additionally, bread production was heavily&#13;
subsidized (8.4 percent of GDP in 1994). As of July 1995, these subsidies amounted to 50 percent of&#13;
the price of a loaf of bread and constituted an expensive universal subsidy that did little to target the poor.&#13;
In August 1995, both the bread compensation allowance and the production subsidy were replaced by the&#13;
reintroduction of a targeted bread allowance and a child allowance. In December 1995, the bread&#13;
compensation allowance was doubled to compensate partially for liberalized bread prices. On March 1,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
1996, the Government fully liberalized the prices of bread and flour and increased the bread compensation&#13;
allowance by an additional 70 percent. (Between August 1995 and June 1996 bread prices rose&#13;
approximately eightfold reflecting the removal of public subsidies and higher local currency prices for&#13;
imported wheat.) At the same time, the bread compensation and child allowances were combined into&#13;
single social welfare payment. This social welfare payment, which amounts to TR500 per month, was&#13;
targeted to children under 16 years old (for households with per capita income less than twice the&#13;
minimum wage), non-working pensioners whose pensions are less than double the minimum wage,&#13;
registered unemployed workers, and the disabled. Because of the dramatic changes in the economy in&#13;
recent years, the present targeting system (which is based on 1993 household survey data) needs to be&#13;
revised. The Government has decided to undertake a household survey in order to provide a better basis&#13;
for targeting. In the 1996 budget, Government allocated TR7.8 billion for social welfare compensation.&#13;
This allocation assumes 1.4 million of beneficiaries (out of a population of 5.8 million). Should the&#13;
number of applicants for assistance during 1996 prove to be higher than expected, the Government will,&#13;
in consultation with IDA, adopt corrective measures to keep the total amount of allowances within the&#13;
budget allocation.&#13;
TARGETING SOCIAL PAYMENTS: PENSION, SOCIAL INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT&#13;
BENEFITS&#13;
4.    In 1991, Government set up three extra-budgetary funds to replace the large social transfers from&#13;
Moscow. Each of the three funds was given a share of the 39 percent tax on enterprise wage bills. Of&#13;
the three funds, the largest is the Pension Fund, which receives just over 32 percentage points of the tax.&#13;
The Social Insurance Fund and the Employment Fund account for six and one percentage points of the&#13;
payroll tax, respectively. Since the end of 1993, inflation and the downward spiral of output has meant&#13;
that enterprises have been unable or unwilling to pay the wage bill tax with the result that each of the&#13;
funds has suffered serious revenue shortfalls. In turn, there have been many months when the funds have&#13;
not been able to make payments to their beneficiaries. The current economic and financial situation&#13;
provides little ground for optimism that regular full payments will be resumed in the near term.&#13;
5.    The Pension Fund is responsible for the payment of retirement benefits (about three-quarters of&#13;
the Fund's obligations) as well as payments for invalids and some other social benefits. Presently, there&#13;
are numerous structural problems with the Pension Fund that have contributed to the current crisis.&#13;
These include: (a) the fund's promise to pay pensions on the basis of workers' previous income, as if&#13;
those workers were paying into an investment account, whereas current pension payments are based on&#13;
current payments by enterprises; (b) isolation from the central government budgetary process; and (c) a&#13;
rate of taxation on the wage bill is too high. Consequently, the system needs to be reformed to create&#13;
an effective and sustainable social safety net -- albeit one with lower levels of benefits than during the&#13;
Soviet era. Therefore, in June 1996, as a temporary measure, Government limited: (a) the value of&#13;
pensions in order to achieve greater regularity in payments; and (b) the monthly payment to the amount&#13;
of actual revenue collections. Further, Government has announced that all pensioners will be paid at the&#13;
minimum rate and that the monthly surplus in the Pension Fund, if any, will be distributed to the eligible&#13;
pensioners proportionately to their entitlements. Any arrears that are accumulated will be canceled at&#13;
the end of each quarter. Additionally, Government has announced that pensions will no longer be paid&#13;
to working pensioners.In order to improve the administration of social insurance, in February 1996,&#13;
Government consolidated the collection of all payroll taxes under the responsibility of a single agency and&#13;
centralized the collection and allocation of Pension Fund revenues to mitigate regional disparities. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
addition, the Government removed the responsibility for paying child allowances from the Pension Fund&#13;
and integrated it with the social welfare payment.&#13;
6.    The Social Insurance Fund is an extra-budgetary fund managed by the Governing Council of&#13;
Trade Unions that pays sick leave and maternity benefits and also provides various worker amenities.&#13;
As with the Pension Fund, the Social Insurance Fund has been unable to meet its commitments in recent&#13;
years. Entitlement are generous by international standards and give rise, when in operation, to excessive&#13;
use of limited health care services. Sick leave benefits provide up to 100 percent of a worker's salary&#13;
for up to four months and birth grants are provided for up to three children. Recognizing the need to&#13;
reduce these benefits, Government issued a decree that reduces maximum sick leave entitlement to one&#13;
month per year and submitted the supporting legislation to the Majlisi Oli. Additionally, Government&#13;
plans to transfer responsibility for sickness and maternity leave benefits to the enterprise responsible for&#13;
employing the individual.&#13;
7.    The Employment Fund was set up to finance the Employment Centers -- the main institutions&#13;
through which certain benefits for labor are delivered, e.g., job placement, payment of unemployment&#13;
benefits, public works for the unemployed, training and retraining, protection of disabled and&#13;
disadvantaged workers, and registration and repatriation of refugees from the civil war. There are two&#13;
immediate problems with Employment Centers that need to be addressed. First, as presently constituted,&#13;
the unemployment funds are regional with the result if enterprises in a particular region do not pay the&#13;
wage bill tax, unemployment benefits are not paid. A more centralized fund would allow inter-regional&#13;
transfers to more distressed areas. Second, with the current unemployment benefits set equal to the&#13;
minimum wage and an employment tax of one percent, the Employment Fund would run a deficit if those&#13;
claiming benefits are more than four percent of the labor force. Therefore, Government has discontinued&#13;
financing wage subsidies for maintaining jobs in financially distressed enterprises.&#13;
SUPPLEMENTARY JOB-CREATION&#13;
8.    The combination of only very slow economic recovery (and therefore slow employment growth)&#13;
and a rapidly growing labor force (by at least 100,000 annually) mean the problem of unemployment will&#13;
not be solved by growth in the near term. Even if economic growth were to be as much as five percent&#13;
per year, in contrast to the projection of continuing decline for the next two to three years, the number&#13;
of new jobs would still be only about 60,000 per year -- well short of what is necessary to absorb new&#13;
entrants to the labor force.Recognizing the magnitude of the unemployment problem, Government has&#13;
allocated TR150 million for the public works program managed by the Employment Service. Such an&#13;
approach is especially attractive given the considerable amount of rehabilitation and reconstruction work&#13;
(e.g., roads, bridges, schools and clinics) that needs to be completed.&#13;
POVERTY ASSESSMENT&#13;
9.    The Government needs assistance to prepare a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy. This&#13;
would include preparing a profile of the poor and of vulnerable groups as well as mechanisms for&#13;
monitoring changes in poverty. Because of acute data limitations, technical support will be needed to&#13;
prepare this profile and the poverty reduction strategy. Under the Credit, agreement was reached with&#13;
the Government on the terms of reference for a poverty assessment.&#13;

OUTLINE&#13;
LEGAL STATUS AND STRUCTURE &amp; ROLES OF BOARD AND OF EXECUTIVE&#13;
OFFICE&#13;
1.    LEGAL STATUS OF THE TASIF:&#13;
A.    The TASIF should be set up as an independently operating and disbursing institution&#13;
which reports to the Government through the office of the Prime Minister.&#13;
B.    A Presidential Decree should be issued asap to establish the TASIF and to establish its&#13;
two main bodies (the Board and the Executive Office) and its authorities in managing funds on&#13;
behalf of the Government of Tajikistan. This decree will need to be confirmed by Parliament asap&#13;
and not later than for loan effectiveness.&#13;
C.    The TASIF will develop a Constitutional Charter for the Board and a Manual of&#13;
Operations which will lay down the rules and regulations with which it operates and how it&#13;
identifies micro-projects and commits and disburses funds. These two documents will require no&#13;
objection of the World Bank. The Manual of Operations will require to be in an advanced draft&#13;
format as WB-Board condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-&#13;
2.    STRUCTURE OF THE TASIF:&#13;
A.    See organogram and staffing table attached.&#13;
B.    ROLE OF THE BOARD.&#13;
C.    See note attached.&#13;
D.    This is to elaborate on the notes referred to in #.5 above.&#13;
E.    The Board should develop in the first quarter of its existence a Constitutional Charter&#13;
which lays down its operating mechanisms and its role, functions and authorities.&#13;
F.    The board will probably meet on a quarterly basis for scheduled meetings. Extraordinary&#13;
meetings could be called: conditions should be defined. It is the Secretary of the Board, the&#13;
Executive Director who organizes the board meetings with the approval of the Chairman of the&#13;
Board (the Prime Minister).&#13;
G.    The board meetings will follow an agenda approved by the Chairman. This agenda will&#13;
have some permanent functions:&#13;
*  once a year, approve the annual investment program  (include. performance&#13;
indicators)&#13;
and the budget for the next year;&#13;
*  twice a year, approve quarterly audit reports on procedures and accountancy;&#13;
*  each quarter, approve the implementation schedule of the Executive Office;&#13;
*  each quarter, approve the program and relative budget revisions;&#13;
*  each quarter, approve the progress report of the Executive office, and approve the&#13;
Executive Summary of the Quarterly Report for reporting to the Government through&#13;
the Prime Minister.&#13;
H.    The different departments and support units of the Executive Office of the TASIF will&#13;
also include some specific items on the agenda scheduled throughout the year to balance the&#13;
activities of the different regular quarterly board meetings.&#13;
I.    It is clear that what is meant by TASIF Board approval means that the Board verifies&#13;
whether the Executive Office (EO) has implemented its daily management task in accordance with&#13;
the Manual of Operations (MO), and that its performance is in line with the performance&#13;
indicators. The TASIF EO will be submitted to a bi-annual audit which will verify whether the&#13;
EO has followed the procedures as outlined in the MO and that its accounts are in accordance&#13;
with WB-standards. These audits will produce a report on two quarters, which will be submitted&#13;
to the Board for their approval. These audit reports provide the guarantee that the EO is&#13;
performing according to its mandate.&#13;
J.    The Board can propose modifications to the procedures in the MO. Such modifications&#13;
are normal as situations can change and as the MO cannot predict all kinds of circumstances.&#13;
However, they require WB no-objection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117-&#13;
K.    The Board can propose modifications to the Overall Investment Strategy and to the&#13;
Annual Investment Program, but these modifications require WB no-objection.&#13;
L.    A no-objection procedure by the WB requires typically between two to four months&#13;
because of the time required for the transmission of the information.&#13;
M.    The Board is in charge to hire and fire the Executive Director of the EO. In the MO there&#13;
is a section which describes the Staff Service Rules (SSR). The Board will have to follow the&#13;
rules as described in the SSR to be able to enact that authority.&#13;
N.    The Chairman of the Board will sign contracts over a minimum threshold on approval&#13;
of these contracts by the Board. Signing a contract of that nature will require WB no-objection&#13;
as well. It is clear that a micro-project which exceeds the threshold will take a longer&#13;
implementation schedule than normal micro-projects (which fall within the threshold).&#13;
4.    ROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE:&#13;
A.    The Executive Office (EO) under the direction of the Executive Director (ED) is in&#13;
charge of the daily management of the TASIF under strict procedures as described in the MO.&#13;
B.    The EO is in charge of selecting the microprojects to be presented in the Quarterly&#13;
Implementation Schedules to the Board in respect of the criteria and procedures set forth in the&#13;
MO and of the Annual Investment Program (AIP).&#13;
C.    The ED is responsible to manage its program to achieve the goals and objectives set forth&#13;
in the AIP. This may require him to recruit consultants and to purchase goods. Within his budget&#13;
limitations, and acting as a good housefather, he is therefore responsible to sign contracts on&#13;
these issues, and to authorize and sign disbursement orders. The ED is only authorized to sign&#13;
contracts and authorize and sign disbursement orders within the threshold. He cannot sign&#13;
extensions or change orders to contracts which carry the original total contracts' amount above&#13;
that threshold.&#13;
D.    In order to be able to disburse the EO will have to open a bank account, at a commercial&#13;
banking institution of the ED's choice - with approval of the Board and no-objection of the WB.&#13;
E.    The ED will delegate the task of managing the personnel matters to the Finance and&#13;
Administration Manager (FAM). He will supervise that task. The FAM will ensure that the SSR&#13;
will be fully respected, and in that respect the FAM will organize - after the approval of next&#13;
year's program and budget - that all the staff will participate in the setting of the next year's&#13;
performance indicators for each of them, as well as evaluating each of the staff against the&#13;
previously set performance indicators. Consequently to this evaluation exercise the ED will make&#13;
a proposal to the next board meeting concerning staff bonuses, promotions and/or sanctions.&#13;
F.    The ED will delegate the task of the preparation of the Annual Investment Program (with&#13;
eventual revision of the Global Investment Strategy) to the Investment Planner (IP). The IP will&#13;
organize through consultants a special targeting exercise, to identify the highest poverty areas in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
the country, in the regions and in the districts with comparative poverty assessment methods. The&#13;
targeting is an important exercise to ensure that the objectives of the TASIF are really being met.&#13;
G.    The ED will delegate to the Micro-Project Area Managers the task of the promotion, the&#13;
identification, the selection, the preparation, the implementation and supervision and the hand-&#13;
over of the micro-projects in accordance with the procedures of the MO.&#13;
H.    The MP1&amp;2 will further organize through their promotion unit another targeting exercise&#13;
(through consultants) which consists in identifying the highest poverty communities within the&#13;
highest priority poverty districts. The consultants will then actively promote the project in those&#13;
highest priority communities. In the process of promotion, the consultant will also provide&#13;
information on how to lower or defy harassment.&#13;
I.     The MP1&amp;2 will ensure that micro-projects will be selected in accordance of the&#13;
procedures and criteria as described in the MO:&#13;
J.     The MP1&amp;2 will ensure that the communities will be actively involved in the entire&#13;
process cycle of the micro-projects, from the identification, through the preparation to the&#13;
implementation, handover and operation and maintenance of it. Several options degrees of&#13;
participation of communities are available to ensure both that the micro-project responds to the&#13;
communities' highest needs and that through their participation a sense of ownership develops&#13;
which is a large part of the sustainability of the micro-project. Wherever the community lacks&#13;
the skills in the micro-project cycle the TASIF can involve consultants.&#13;
K.    The communities will participate for approx. 15% to the cost of the micro-project. As&#13;
this is indeed a heavy contribution from these poorest communities, a very wide variety of&#13;
possibilities should be explored to achieve this goal. Besides financial, labor and or material&#13;
contributions other solutions should be acceptable to TASIF, even if this may lead to some un-&#13;
desirable side activities.&#13;
L.    The micro-projects will need, to be environmentally sound. They should certainly have&#13;
no negative effect on the environment, and preferably improve the situation. Sensitive micro-&#13;
projects are water and waste water related, surface drainages which can cause erosion, and other&#13;
types of micro-projects.&#13;
M.    The micro-projects should be cost-effective. This means that an effort has to be put in&#13;
to design technical specifications which are less costly, and that a competitive procurement&#13;
procedure has to be undertaken. Cost efficiency of scale is not a priority. But it is also important&#13;
to ensure that the final quality of the works will be of the best available standards.&#13;
N.    The micro-projects should be sustainable. The MP1&amp;2 should ensure that a maintenance&#13;
and operations plan is being designed for the output of the micro-project which includes&#13;
identification of budgets and how this budgets will be obtained. Solid guarantees for this are&#13;
required before approval of the micro-project. If community contributions are required, a cost&#13;
recovery mechanism has to be designed and assurances have to be sought that they will be applied&#13;
once the micro-project is handed-over to the community or the client.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119-&#13;
0.    The MP1&amp;2 will ensure that proper supervision will be installed on each of the micro-&#13;
projects under implementation. Local supervisors - eventually proposed by the communities - are&#13;
preferable. Strict supervision reporting and consequent progress payment procedures will be&#13;
installed to enter into the computerized monitoring system of the TASIF.&#13;
P.    The ED will ensure, with the assistance of the procurement specialist that all procurement&#13;
procedures in the TASIF will be in accordance with WB rules and regulations and with the&#13;
specific details as stated in the MO.&#13;
Q.    The ED will ensure that the MIS Manager keeps up to date a complex and detailed&#13;
Management Information System (MIS) which gathers data on processes and progress for the use&#13;
of the different managers in the EO. The MIS is a most important tool for managing this type&#13;
of projects. Although a technologically simple project, the management of multiple small funds&#13;
delegated to inexperienced and widely dispersed organizations within a country with poor&#13;
communication means is a high risk undertaking. A very thorough collection of data will have&#13;
to be put in place, with strict reporting procedures and an MIS system which can provide very&#13;
up-to-date globalized reporting for the managers. It is important that the managers instill&#13;
themselves the discipline to make optimal use of the outputs of the MIS: they are the example&#13;
to the lower staff and to the NGO's and communities, and they need the information to ensure&#13;
that the project is well managed and can generate the kind of quantities of micro-projects which&#13;
can have an impact on the poverty.&#13;
R.    The ED will delegate the task of keeping very accurate accounts to the FAM. The FAM&#13;
will receive documented justifications for each commitments and expenditures from the MIS&#13;
system. Commitments and expenditures without such justification cannot be entered into the&#13;
accountancy system. The MIS and the accountancy system will work in parallel, but as two&#13;
independent mechanisms. The design of both should allow for easy comparison between them.&#13;
S.    The ED will facilitate the regular audits over the TASIF. Bi-annual audits will be&#13;
conducted to control the respect of the procedures and the financial rules and regulations of the&#13;
project. The audits will be conducted over two quarters of the year, and should produce a report&#13;
which can be presented to the board within three months after the end of the second quarter&#13;
covered by the audit. This auditing procedure guarantees that the EO cannot abuse the authorities&#13;
of micro-project selection, contract signing and disbursement vested in its autonomous status. An&#13;
annual audit, consolidation of two bi-annual audits will also be produced.&#13;
T.    The ED will produce a commentary to the bi-annual audit to the same board meeting,&#13;
certainly when the audits point out irregularities. The ED should organize a competitive bidding&#13;
to allow the board to appoint the audits.&#13;
U.    The EO will conduct regular impact evaluation exercises, which consist in measuring the&#13;
impact of the TASIF program versus its objectives. Indicators will be developed for that purpose.&#13;
The EO will study these impact evaluations very carefully and prepare recommendations how&#13;
impact can be improved and/or how impact evaluation can be improved. The WB will conduct&#13;
impact evaluations over the project as well, and compare notes with the internal impact evaluation&#13;
reports.&#13;

Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
1.    The Government of Tajikistan will establish the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund&#13;
(TASIF) as a mechanism to reduce poverty through the financing of labor-intensive works and&#13;
other income-generating microprojects identified and implemented by community-based&#13;
organizations. Small private building contractors will be selected competitively to execute&#13;
contracts whenever feasible and Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) will be used to target&#13;
poorer segments of the population who have potential to benefit from small income-generation&#13;
projects, especially in agriculture production and marketing.&#13;
2.    A computerized Management Information System (MIS) is needed to track the large&#13;
number of microprojects to be financed by the TASIF. The MIS must be interactive so that&#13;
TASIF staff can input information on a day-to-day basis, while also being designed with adequate&#13;
security measures. The attributes of the MIS will include the ability to:&#13;
o         store basic information on microprojects;&#13;
*         track the microproject portfolio through the microproject cycle;&#13;
*         record materials and inputs needed for each microproject; and&#13;
*         track financial disbursements.&#13;
3.    The MIS will enable simplified reports to be created for managers of the TASIF to&#13;
facilitate their day-to-day management and to meet reporting requirements of the TASIF Board&#13;
and donors participating in the project.&#13;
4.    The MIS Specialist will provide technical assistance to the MIS Officer of the TASIF in&#13;
order to conceptualize and develop an MIS for the TASIF that meets World Bank specifications&#13;
for project effectiveness. The MIS Specialist will be responsible for:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
5.    Assessing the information needs of the TASIF, taking into account its administrative and&#13;
organizational structure and reporting requirements&#13;
6.    Work with the TASIF MIS Officer to conceptualize and develop an MIS for the TASIF&#13;
by either adopting an existing system or creating a new one. This is to be done within reasonable&#13;
financial boundaries and with cognizance of available local skills and support systems needed to&#13;
operate and maintain an MIS in Tajikistan.&#13;
7.    Providing specifications on the hardware and software to be procured for the MIS.&#13;
8.    Providing guidelines to TASIF on the skills and qualifications needed to maintain the&#13;
system.&#13;
9.    Advising the MIS Officer who will be responsible for training TASIF staff in operating&#13;
and maintaining the system.&#13;
10.   Time-frame: It is estimated that the consultant would travel to Tajikistan in December-&#13;
January for approximately 2 weeks. This would be followed up by 2-3 times over the subsequent&#13;
12 months to guide development, testing and refinement of the MIS.&#13;
11.   Qualifications: The consultant will have a strong background in database development&#13;
maintenance and be familiar with MIS systems used in similar projects, and software to run such&#13;
systems. The consultant will also be experienced in conceptualizing, developing and operating&#13;
computerized integrated management information and accounting systems. The consultant will&#13;
speak Russian. The best qualified consultant will be experienced in developing and upgrading an&#13;
MIS for other social funds.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Draft T.O.R. for the Technical Advisor to the TASIF:&#13;
The Technical Advisor to the TAS[F should be a qualitied Public Works andi'or Construction Engineer&#13;
with preferably experience in Social Investment Funds or equivalent types oftprojects. He should have&#13;
an extensive experience in managing and planning construction and infrastructure type projects with a&#13;
multitude of smaller sub-projects of varied natures which are implemented in a widespread geographical&#13;
environment. He should preferably have experience in construction management in the former Soviet&#13;

companies and with consultants. It is essential to realise that such contractors and consultants&#13;
are either rare or at least inexperienced witih such procedures in Tajikistan, and will therefore&#13;
require to be identified, trained, closely supervised and monitored with an objective of capacity&#13;
and institution building in the construction sector in Tajikistan;&#13;
involvement of implementing agencies as sub-contractors for TASIF. whether consultants,&#13;
local associations or institutions, sometimes even local authorities. The TASIF staff has to be&#13;
assisted in learning how to delegate work to such organisations. These implementing&#13;
organisations are generally also lacking experience in this type of service delivery.&#13;
*       the development ofTASIF specific technical specifications, which should correspond to the&#13;
local standards and norms, but which should also be designed such that they encourage labour&#13;
intensive work methods, which can be implemented with limited means of small contractors&#13;
and which should be within the capacities of the communities to supervise and to ensure&#13;
maintenance and operations atler microproject implementation;&#13;
*       putting in place proper construction management procedures, in line with contractual&#13;
conditions (contractors in the former Soviet Union have little experience w&amp;ith such concept), to&#13;
ensure:&#13;
- potential development of the small and medium contracting business in Tajikistan;&#13;
- adequate quality and quantity control on the building sites, through the installation of&#13;
qualified and systematic supervision and progress monitoring procedures,&#13;
- the installation of adequate hand-over procedures,&#13;
- proper maintenance and operations'procedures after hand-over (sustainability).&#13;
on the development of the poverty targeting procedures of the TASIF,&#13;
*       on the training needs for contractors, consultants, implementing partners as well as for the&#13;

progress payments.&#13;
The Technical Advisor will report to the Executive Director and will closely collaborate with the Area&#13;
M'vanagers and their staff.&#13;
The Technical Advisor vill closely collaborate with the Management Advisor for issues of common&#13;
interest.&#13;

ANNEX K&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
Review of NGO Activities in Tajikistan&#13;
based on a Desk Study of Reports and other Documents&#13;
by Lawrence S. Cumming&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.       This review focuses primarily on NGOs which have an interest and programming&#13;
capacity that has an economic as well as a social character and impact.(See table 1 for a summary&#13;
of all International NGO programs in Tajikistan)&#13;
OVERVIEW OF NGO SECTOR&#13;
2.        This report deals more with foreign than with national or local NGOs. All available&#13;
evidence suggests that local NGOs, to the extent that they exist, tend to be rather new, small and&#13;
lacking in experience. Therefore, they would not be in a position to implement projects funded&#13;
under the PPAP.&#13;
3.        The pre-eminent exception to this rule would be the Pamir Relief and Development&#13;
Program (PRDP) which was established by the Aga Khan Foundation. Though young, it operates&#13;
with a level of resources not enjoyed by any other Tajikistan NGO. Another exception might be&#13;
the national Red Crescent Society which is described as the largest domestic NGO in Tajikistan,&#13;
in terms of its membership, with chapters throughout the country.&#13;
4.    This fact points up a dilemma for the Bank. On the one hand, circumstances suggest the&#13;
need for supporting activities likely to have relatively quick results. On the other, it would be&#13;
desirable to build national and local NGO capacity for the longer run. This dilemma might best&#13;
be resolved by giving priority support to those international NGOs which demonstrate the most&#13;
serious evidence of involvement in building partnership with and in strengthening local and&#13;
national NGO bodies.&#13;
A.    Networks Between/Among NGOs: In-country Networks&#13;
5.    In the wake of the 1992-93 civil war, NGOs and donors working in Tajikistan began to&#13;
meet regularly and formed a committee of international organizations. It currently meets every&#13;
Monday morning. This initiative was previously convened by the UNHCR but is now being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125-&#13;
chaired by UNDP. The purpose of this grouping is to share information and, wherever possible,&#13;
to co-ordinate action. Apart from the regular weekly donors meeting, the foreign NGOs meet&#13;
once a month to discuss issues of concern to them.&#13;
6.    There is no indigenous NGO coordinating organization in Tajikistan, though there is an&#13;
NGO Resource Center which Counterpart Consortium (CC) has assisted. This is housed in the&#13;
same building as Counterpart and shares facilities with that organization.&#13;
7.    Counterpart and Save the Children (US) jointly support the NGO Capacity Building&#13;
Project which is a training scheme for NGO staff, both those associated with local NGOs and the&#13;
locally engaged Tajik staff of foreign NGOs.&#13;
B.    Networks in the Region or Beyond&#13;
8.    The Project for Economic Reform and Development in Central Asia (PERDCA), though&#13;
not itself an NGO, maintains an NGO support function in Central Asia, assisting NGOs to&#13;
develop regional contacts. One of its services is Silknet, an electronic network connecting&#13;
organizations in Tajikistan and neighboring republics. With assistance from the Eurasia&#13;
Foundation and the Soros Foundation, it will continue to install sub-nodes throughout the region.&#13;
9.    Counterpart Consortium (CC), with USAID assistance, maintains the Nongovernmental&#13;
Organization Support Initiative for Central Asia. (It now has a Tajikistan office and, as noted&#13;
above, is actively involved in training.) CC offers training for indigenous NGOs (management&#13;
and sustainability), promotes and facilitates information exchange and partnerships and offers a&#13;
seed grants program, including "partnership grants" for strengthening capacity to serve members&#13;
and "corporate challenge grants" which encourage corporations to contribute matching monies.&#13;
To the end of 1995, the Consortium reports that more than 300 Central Asian NGOs have&#13;
received training, that a region-wide data base on local NGOs has been formed and is being&#13;
continuously updated and that forty nine (49) grants totalling over $350,000 have been awarded&#13;
throughout the region.&#13;
C.    Current/Planned NGO Projects: Refugee Assistance&#13;
10.   Due to the conditions resulting from the civil war (1992-93), the UNHCR has played a&#13;
leading role in humanitarian aid to Tajikistan to assist returning refugees and other displaced&#13;
persons.&#13;
11.    Some examples of NGO assistance to refugees include:&#13;
*       a study of the needs of refugees, with particular reference to water and&#13;
sanitation which the IRC conducted in August-September, 1993.&#13;
*       the Aga Khan Foundation/PRDP humanitarian relief effort. One evaluation&#13;
characterized the AKF feeding program as having "literally rescued the&#13;
population of Gorno-Badakshan from the threat of famine" and, therefore,&#13;
as one of the outstanding examples of NGO response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
*       the SCF (US) assisted some 62,000 refugees and internally displaced persons&#13;
in the wake of the civil war to rebuild and rehabilitate housing whilst feeding&#13;
some 27,000 brigade workers through food for work projects.&#13;
D.      Micro-enterprise/Credit and Small Enterprise Development&#13;
12.     The Tajikistan Government has defined micro-enterprises as those having up to nine&#13;
(9) employees and small enterprises as having between ten (10) and one hundred and ninety-nine&#13;
(199) employees.&#13;
13.     Some examples are as follows:&#13;
*       SCF (U.S.) has been supporting a group guaranteed lending program&#13;
(GGLP) at the village level in Khatlon Region (patterned after the ASA&#13;
Program and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh) and has engaged in training for&#13;
small enterprise development for women and their families as well as small&#13;
business entrepreneurs. The early experience of this program has been quite&#13;
positive; for instance, there has been a zero default rate on loans.&#13;
i       SCF (U.K.) has sponsored small enterprise development through a&#13;
monetization scheme and small scale income generation projects. These have&#13;
been specifically directed towards female headed households.&#13;
-       The Soros Foundation has provided financial assistance to both SCF (U.S.)&#13;
and SCF (U.K.) for their micro-enterprise and credit schemes.&#13;
For a period of about five months in early 1995, Mercy Corps International&#13;
(MCI) sponsored monetization projects using food donated by the U.S.&#13;
Department of Agriculture. Through the mechanism of third-party&#13;
agreements, all credits extended under such projects are repaid to local non-&#13;
profit organizations and not to MCI.&#13;
*       Relief International (RI) has made a contribution through quick impact&#13;
projects (QIPs) focusing on women heads of families. All 1,350 women who&#13;
had participated in the QIPs subsequently were offered training. Of these,&#13;
five hundred and forty (540) had done so by the end of 1995. Ninety percent&#13;
(90%) of business plan proposals (goat, sheep and poultry breeding, bread&#13;
making, sewing, knitting, soap making and so on) had been accepted as of&#13;
that time.&#13;
*       Shelter Now International (SNI) has supported capacity in small enterprise&#13;
development through on-the-job training and the provision of building&#13;
products.&#13;
*       Various NGOs have reported on projects which produce goods and materials.&#13;
IRC, for instance, has been supporting the rehabilitation of small soap and&#13;
shoe production industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127-&#13;
*        MCI has made loans to agricultural enterprises and reports quite favorable&#13;
results.&#13;
*       AED, in partnership with the US Embassy/Department of Commerce, has&#13;
established a Business Initiative Resource Center, though this would appear&#13;
to be somewhat beyond the scope of this study. It also, reportedly, benefits&#13;
larger businesses rather than small and micro enterprises.&#13;
E.       Rehabilitation/Reconstruction - Public Works and Housing&#13;
14.     The fact that so many NGOs are involved in public works and the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and property is, of course, a direct consequence of the&#13;
1992-93 civil war and the conditions under which they first began their Tajikistan programs.&#13;
Some examples are:&#13;
*       SCF (U.S) took over physical reconstruction from UNHCR (which had&#13;
initiated the program). This food for work (FFW) activity is now being&#13;
supported by USAID. SCF (US) has been involved in housing and schools&#13;
reconstruction projects as well as the clearing of rubble and building of&#13;
irrigation ditches, primarily in West Khatlon. It is also providing plastic&#13;
sheeting for fruit greenhouses.&#13;
e       MCI has taken on both free food distribution and FFW  projects (e.g.&#13;
cleaning drainage systems and parks and public facilities in Dushanbe).&#13;
e       CARITAS has also been involved in a substantial way (with $1,250,000&#13;
funding from European sources) in reconstruction of returning refugees'&#13;
houses and the production of housing tiles.&#13;
*       The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is involved in village&#13;
level disaster prevention and mitigation as well as reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation in landslide prone mountainous areas of the Panjkent region.&#13;
It has co-operated with SCF (US) as well as with SNI in housing&#13;
reconstruction. Because of the interest of a company operating a gold mine&#13;
in the area in improving its public relations situation, IOM has been able to&#13;
involve this firm in a constructive way in support of the project. (Though,&#13;
strictly speaking an intergovernmental organization, IOM has a number of&#13;
NGO characteristics.)&#13;
*       Shelter Now International (SNI) is operating a demonstration facility to&#13;
produce appropriate building materials, notably roofing tiles which, it hopes,&#13;
will be both less expensive in the long run and safer than the asbestos&#13;
sheeting of which much is used.&#13;
F.      Water and Sanitation&#13;
15.     Water and sanitation projects figure prominently in the programs of the IRC and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128-&#13;
UNICEF which work as partners in this area. IRC took over a project in the fall of 1994 begun&#13;
by Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) Belgium and started another such project in Khatlon with&#13;
USAID assistance.&#13;
16.     A recent evaluation concluded that, although the IRC project had been carried out well,&#13;
it did not meet its full potential from a community development point of view. Moreover, it noted&#13;
that impact assessment is lacking. This fact may, perhaps, be due in part to IRC's historic&#13;
emphasis on relief.&#13;
G.      Agriculture, Food Security and Rural Development&#13;
17.     Several NGO projects fall under the heading of agricultural development:&#13;
*       The AKF/PRDP has a large program of assistance to farmers in Gorno-&#13;
Badakshan and has moved from its initial humanitarian relief response to a&#13;
developmental one. It is supplying technical assistance and inputs to&#13;
independent farmers working land leased by collective farms. New varieties&#13;
of wheat appropriate to different geographic, soil and climactic conditions&#13;
have been introduced with very positive production results. As part of the&#13;
contribution from USAID, the AKF/PRDP is supporting the completion of&#13;
the building of the Pamir I electric power facility.&#13;
*       The IRC has supported the rehabilitation and resupply of poultry farms in&#13;
West Khatlon.&#13;
*       The evaluation of AKF/PRDP (mentioned elsewhere) recommends that&#13;
attention be given to the enhancement of livestock and also the potential for&#13;
cold water fish, silk and wool production in Gorno-Badakshan.&#13;
*       German Agro Action (GAA) plays a prominent role and operates in areas of&#13;
Tajikistan where other foreign NGOs have little or no presence. With the&#13;
assistance of the European Union and the German Government, GAA has&#13;
been delivering foodstuffs and other needed supplies in Khodjent and war&#13;
affected areas south of Dushanbe since 1994. It has a large seed distribution,&#13;
upgrading and multiplication scheme operating principally in the Garm and&#13;
Khodjent regions and is proposing a large revolving loan fund. By the time&#13;
current project funding expires, it anticipates having benefited 3,900 farmers&#13;
directly and a possible total of 80,000 persons indirectly. GAA is working&#13;
with emerging private farmers associations which it hopes will eventually&#13;
become multi-purpose organizations with the capacity to extend and supervise&#13;
loans, offer technical assistance through extension services and operate a&#13;
marketing system.&#13;
*       CARE International is actively involved in food security and nutrition. It&#13;
completed its Tajikistan Emergency Logistics Assistance Program (TELAP)&#13;
to distribute emergency medicines and supplies in mid 1994. Together with&#13;
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and supported by USAID&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
funding, it conducted an important study (August, 1994). The study&#13;
recommended that CARE focus on food distribution programs in particular&#13;
areas of need but also that it assist the development of potable water and&#13;
irrigation systems.&#13;
*       though CARE appears to have been cautious about moving from relief to&#13;
development activities and to working with local NGO formations, it is&#13;
proposing to begin a relationship with the Dekhan Farmers Associations by&#13;
providing training and agricultural inputs.&#13;
18.     Several NGOs have sponsored FFW projects is worthy of note. This fact may be not&#13;
unrelated to the prominent roles which USAID and US NGOs are playing in Tajikistan. FFW&#13;
projects, in MCI's view, are useful for creating employment in the short term but do not promote&#13;
sustainability. Interestingly, the aforementioned evaluation of the AKF encourages that agency&#13;
to consider the possibility of supporting FFW projects.&#13;
H.      Institutional/Organizational Development and Capacity Building&#13;
19.     SCF (U.S.) and Counterpart Consortium (CC) have jointly supported a county-wide&#13;
project to build the capacity of NGO local staff in project management and training as well as&#13;
establishing the NGO Resource Center. The capacity building began with the training of SCF's&#13;
own local staff, but now this service is available to the staff of other NGOs, both foreign and&#13;
local. The SCF (US) and CC trainers work as a team.&#13;
20.     The AKF, whose Tajikistan projects were recently evaluated, is credited with having&#13;
established PRDP, the strongest of the national NGOs in the country in terms of its program and&#13;
management capacity.&#13;
21.     The AKF is proposing, as well, to work with the Khorog State University to upgrade&#13;
some of its programs and also to work with four or five universities to improve English language&#13;
instruction.&#13;
22.     The Independent evaluation of the UNHCR SED projects concludes that "IRC's&#13;
particular strength is capacity building". With this in mind, it proposes that IRC concentrate on&#13;
replication of its early projects and development of linking enterprises. (Peduzzi, p. 18) In that&#13;
this is an area of the most critical importance, IRC's response to this recommendation bears&#13;
further examination.&#13;
I.       Health&#13;
23.     Some NGOs have specialized in health programs. Though this is not a priority for the&#13;
proposed Bank initiative, it is worthy of note that some NGOs have chosen to focus on health:&#13;
*       RI has made a substantial contribution in this area. A recent evaluation&#13;
found, however, that its future may be compromised because the focus of its&#13;
work has been with the government health service which is in a severe state&#13;
of crisis due to economic and political conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
*       SCF (US) has likewise been involved in health programming but has&#13;
emphasized the development, strengthening and training of village health&#13;
committees. The same evaluation judged these activities to be a more&#13;
sustainable approach than RI's.&#13;
*       UNICEF began an emergency program in early 1993. In late 1993 it&#13;
conducted a rapid assessment study of the situation and needs of women and&#13;
children in Tajikistan. UNICEF's concerns center on the health and nutrition&#13;
of women and children. Currently, UNICEF is offering support to a variety&#13;
of clinics and hospitals in order to keep as many as possible in operation.&#13;
24.     Some of these agencies with a concentration in health, it should be added, have considerable&#13;
demonstrated capacity in other areas of programming, some of which fit within the Bank's designated&#13;
priorities&#13;
25.     It should be noted as well that some of the emerging Tajikistan NGOs are showing an interest&#13;
in health. This is most notably true of women's and environmental organizations which are, respectively,&#13;
concerned with women's and environmental health issues.&#13;
J.      Civil Society&#13;
26.     Though most of the international NGO activity in the immediate wake of the civil war was&#13;
concerned with emergency relief followed by reconstruction, there are NGOs which have demonstrated&#13;
an interest in the question of what can be done to promote the growth of civil society.&#13;
*     The Counterpart Consortium, together with the American Legal&#13;
Consortium, co-sponsored a regional conference on NGOs and the&#13;
Law (October 29 to November 4, 1995). Representatives of seventy-&#13;
five (75) NGOs and governments from all five countries attended.&#13;
Topics included the relationship between NGOs and government in&#13;
a civil society, an appropriate legal framework for promoting the&#13;
NGO sector, transparency by both NGOs and government,&#13;
registration procedures and tax status for non-profits. The conference&#13;
provided and opportunity for country-specific NGO/government&#13;
groupings to develop recommendations for legislative reform and&#13;
improved administrative procedures.&#13;
*     The Counterpart Consortium/SCF NGO Capacity Development&#13;
training project has been noted above.&#13;
*     The Soros Foundation has stated its intent to support projects to&#13;
extend and promote human rights and to develop the media. Soros&#13;
does not have its own program but provides support to other NGOs&#13;
which have a program development and management capacity. The&#13;
Soros Foundation works throughout the former Soviet Union (FSU).&#13;
It makes seed grants to enable other initiatives to start. Then it&#13;
moves on to other projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
27.      During the three years it has worked in Tajikistan, Soros assisted IRC, MSF, Relief&#13;
International, SCF US and UK and Human Rights International with contributions. Even the UNHCR,&#13;
though clearly not an NGO, received an initial contribution from the Foundation towards its work in the&#13;
post civil war period.&#13;
K.                Analysis of NGO Operating Environment in Tajikistan: Political&#13;
28.      From the top levels of Government, there is official receptivity to NGOs bringing relief and&#13;
development assistance to Tajikistan - notwithstanding varying degrees of enthusiasm from ministry to&#13;
ministry. The Government has responded positively to the idea that the a substantial portion of the&#13;
proposed PPAP to be established through the World Bank loan would be devoted to NGO projects that&#13;
have the potential for "scaling-up".&#13;
29.     However, there has apparently been, it should be added, a recent demonstration of alleged&#13;
government interference in the election of a the President of a national NGO, the Tajikistan Red Crescent&#13;
Society. (The Red Crescent Society is the largest national NGO with branches throughout the country.&#13;
One of its essential principles of operation is independence from the state.) Because of this alleged&#13;
interference, the association called an extraordinary general meeting of the members. In order to ensure&#13;
the freedom and independence of the meeting, invited official observers of both the ICRC and IFRC were&#13;
present. The fact that interference evidently took place in the initial election and that international&#13;
observers were brought in must be regarded as a disturbing sign, notwithstanding that a reversal was&#13;
secured in this particular instance. An indigenous and autonomous Tajikistan NGO without this kind of&#13;
international backing might well have had a more difficult experience.&#13;
L.      Legal&#13;
30.      Because the legal situation of NGOs in Tajikistan has been reasonably well documented, the&#13;
following will simply touch upon some salient features of the law and the regulatory environment.&#13;
31.      The principal laws which apply to NGOs are the Constitution of the Republic of Tajikistan,&#13;
which recognizes the concept of pluralism and the right of citizens to associate, and the Law of Public&#13;
Associations (1991), which defines a public association as "a voluntary unit created by the free will of&#13;
citizens who have united together on the basis of common interests". The definition encompasses a wide&#13;
range of possibilities from trade unions to political parties, mass movements, associations of women,&#13;
veterans and invalids as well as scientific, cultural and sporting organizations and so on.&#13;
32.     The breadth of the field of possibilities is both a virtue and a possible problem. Some observers&#13;
feel that the law lacks precision and a sense of the differences between one kind of organization and&#13;
another. They note, in particular, the substantial distinctions to be made between a political party or a&#13;
trade union and a voluntary association. On the other hand, they would not want to see the law become&#13;
too restrictive. It is important to note that the Law on Public Associations is currently under review and&#13;
amendments are likely to be presented within a few months time.&#13;
33.     NGOs, both foreign and local, must register with the Ministry of Justice under the heading of&#13;
"public associations". There are now over two hundred (200) "NGOs" thus registered, though only a&#13;
small portion these are concerned with relief and/or development, and the majority of those are oriented&#13;
to social welfare. There does, however, appear to be a significant number of environmental NGOs,&#13;
perhaps reflecting a serious degree of concern about the state of the natural environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
34.      The information which an NGO wishing to register with the Ministry of Justice must supply&#13;
is as follows:&#13;
*    its name, purposes and goals;&#13;
*    its structure and the territory within which it will carry out its activities;&#13;
*    the rules for granting and terminating membership;&#13;
*    the rights and obligations of members;&#13;
*    the rules for forming governing bodies and structural subdivisions and the terms of&#13;
office;&#13;
*    its sources of funds and other property;&#13;
*    the procedures for amending its charter;&#13;
*    the procedures for terminating activity and disposing of remaining property&#13;
35.      The registration fees for an international public association amounts to $260 (US); organizations&#13;
operating throughout the Republic must pay the equivalent of $80, and those operating in a rayon or local&#13;
area, $55. Public associations representing invalids and children are exempt, and associations of women,&#13;
veterans and youth pay fifty percent (50%) of the fees applicable. For most foreign NGOs, the fee is not&#13;
a problem. Given the amount of cash available to most local citizens and organizations, however, the fees&#13;
represent a hardship. Effectively, therefore, a great many local public associations will require foreign&#13;
support even to pay their registration fees.&#13;
36.      In the event of denial of registration, the right of appeal to the Supreme Court exists.&#13;
37.      As regards taxes, the Public Associations Law specifies that Public Associations must pay taxes&#13;
on "entrepreneurial activities". Under a decree of the Supreme Council of the Republic, there are certain&#13;
exceptions to this rule, including enterprises and institutions related to associations of invalids, museums,&#13;
libraries, theaters and so on. Rates of income taxes may be reduced where profits are devoted to&#13;
charitable purposes.&#13;
38.      In the event of an international treaty whose provisions are different from local legislation, the&#13;
former will prevail.&#13;
39.     It should be added that organizations operating in a particular region or locality must register&#13;
with the department of justice of the particular regional council of people's deputies.&#13;
40.      The formal legal requirements for establishing an foreign-based or international NGO in&#13;
Tajikistan are minimal. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of International Organizations and&#13;
International Law is the body which registers foreign NGOs. (There is no requirement that local NGOs&#13;
register with the Foreign Ministry.) The organization must submit the following under cover letter:&#13;
(i)  its by-laws or charter;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
(ii) a statement of its goals, objectives and activities in Tajikistan and;&#13;
(iii) a written mandate from headquarters for the organization's senior official posted to the&#13;
country.&#13;
41.      Approval by the Foreign Ministry can be granted very quickly. The foreign NGO then has&#13;
access to free consular services and many privileges available to the diplomatic corp. Some NGO&#13;
representatives have observed that the Justice Ministry tends to be the controlling face of government,&#13;
whereas the Foreign Ministry adopts a more facilitating stance with regard to the registration of foreign&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
42.      Finally, as regards micro and small enterprise development, there appears to be no legal&#13;
problem in organizing and registering businesses. It is worthy of mention here since some of the foreign&#13;
NGOs are sponsoring and encouraging micro and small enterprise activities.&#13;
M.       Regulatory&#13;
43.      It is in the administration of the law where some NGOs observe or experience difficulties. For&#13;
instance, as noted above, some have found attitudes held by some Justice officials to be "dirigiste". On&#13;
the other hand, a senior official of the same Ministry confirmed to this author that the policy of the&#13;
Government is to encourage a vibrant NGO sector which can help to address the severe socio-economic&#13;
problems which the country is facing.&#13;
44.      The experience of local NGOs in securing the registration of their charters varies considerably.&#13;
Some speak of the procedures as being complicated and cumbersome, of having had to wait two years&#13;
or more and of having had to submit answers to questions not asked at the outset. There is a feeling that&#13;
"city NGOs" with access to money and government offices have an easier time than rural ones, and&#13;
especially those which represent the very poor. One NGO representative claimed that officials sometimes&#13;
seek bribes. Other organizations, however, appear to have enjoyed a relatively easy process. It may be&#13;
that some types of associations, those which represent disabled people for instance, find more ready&#13;
acceptance because their categories are specifically recognized in law.&#13;
45.      Taxation matters are the source of a good deal of concern for NGOs, both foreign based and&#13;
local. Notwithstanding that the Public Associations Law appears to restrict taxation to "entrepreneurial&#13;
activities" that might be carried on public associations - and hence profits earned - there does appear to&#13;
be considerable confusion regarding how the law is to be interpreted. Several NGO representatives&#13;
interviewed in the course of the May, 1996 Mission spoke of their fear that their revenues, regardless&#13;
of source or purpose, will be taxed. This has led some to operate on a cash system rather than through&#13;
a bank. Whilst most registered NGOs appear not to be paying taxes, this uncertainly is obviously not very&#13;
satisfactory, and clarification is needed. The problem appears to be that a distinction between profits&#13;
earned from business activity on the one hand and revenues generated from charitable giving and official&#13;
donors on the other may not be well understood. There would also appear to be an element of confusion&#13;
about national pension plan contributions. This whole area of taxation and related matters is of concern&#13;
and will need to be followed carefully.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
N.      Successful Project Completion by Sector: Small Enterprise Development&#13;
46.     Quite promising results have been reported from small enterprise credit programs. As one&#13;
example, the SCF (US) Group Guaranteed Lending Program has had a repayment rate of 100 per cent&#13;
(as of mid 1995). During its visit to Tajikistan, the World Bank Mission was informed that MCI expects&#13;
a 95 percent (95%) repayment rate on loans it has extended.&#13;
47.     A recent Independent Evaluation of the UNHCR supported SED projects found that:&#13;
*   the IRC soap making project was economically viable and easily replicable and that the&#13;
products were produced in a cost effective and technologically appropriate manner.&#13;
(Peduzzi, op. cit.)pp. 8-9) The USAID PVO evaluation also found this project&#13;
"impressive". (Wenger et al., op. cit., p. 13).&#13;
*   the IRC poultry project farms had the potential to be economically viable by the Spring&#13;
of 1996 and replicable, though it raised questions as to their sustainability in light of&#13;
inflation. (pp. 10-11) As added endorsement, the USAID PVO evaluation commented&#13;
very favorably on this project. (p. 12).&#13;
*   the IRC's oil production project is economically viable and profitable as long as cotton&#13;
seed and electricity are available. Profitability will be enhanced by the production of&#13;
purified oil. In a stable economic environment oil press enterprises should be sustainable.&#13;
They should also be replicable. (pp. 12-13)&#13;
*    the IRC shoe masking facility is less viable than the soap factory though with low cost&#13;
sewing machines and home based production, successful shoe making enterprise should&#13;
be replicable. (pp. 14-15)&#13;
3   the RI SED Training Program for Village Women evaluation noted that further training&#13;
will likely be required to reinforce that already given, that trainees had "demonstrated a&#13;
reasonably fair comprehension of the (business) concepts" but that "the biggest obstacle&#13;
facing the women is marketing" and that "another possible obstacle . . . is the&#13;
procurement of raw materials". (pp. 21-22)&#13;
48.     Another study of enterprise development (Pruyne, op. cit., p. 17) proposed to UNDP that this&#13;
project be evaluated for potential replication, and if positive, that it be expanded to other parts of&#13;
Tajikistan beyond its present base in Khatlon. Without prejudging the outcome of the evaluation, the study&#13;
was evidently expressing a vote of confidence in the merits and efficacy of credit schemes aimed at&#13;
women.&#13;
49.     In the judgement of the US PVO evaluation, some of the most outstanding among the physical&#13;
building and rehabilitation projects were:&#13;
*     the IRC Water and Sanitation program which put potable water within reach of 40,000&#13;
beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
*      the SCF (US) FFW program which provided shelter for some 100,000 people&#13;
0.       Rural Development&#13;
50.     As noted above, the AKF/PRDP initiative has been ranked highly by the evaluation&#13;
commissioned by World Learning Inc. (the agency administering USAID granted funds for support of&#13;
U.S. NGOs working in Tajikistan).&#13;
51.     PRDP, with technical assistance from AKF, has placed a high priority on institutional&#13;
development to ensure continuity of progress and replicability of results. . . By any objective standard&#13;
or comparison of results with similar efforts elsewhere, the performance of PRDP has been outstanding.&#13;
(Fort, op.cit., pp. 1-2 and 10)&#13;
P.      Capacity Building&#13;
52.     The capacity development efforts of the AKF and its local counterpart, the PRDP also scored&#13;
very highly by this same evaluation. In fact, the evaluation thought the level of intemal competence has&#13;
reached such a high level that the PRDP ought now to redirect its capacity development efforts to&#13;
strengthening other local organizations. (Ibid.)&#13;
53.     According to another evaluation, the SCF (US) was worthy of recognition. Through its&#13;
emphasis on village health committees and its projects which involve local participation in management,&#13;
it supports the goal of sustainability. Moreover, it does all of this within a reasonable cost structure.&#13;
(Wenger, et al., op. cit., pp. 17-19)&#13;
Q.      Reliance on external funding sources&#13;
54.     Given the political/economic situation of Tajikistan, it is difficult to imagine there being much&#13;
potential, for some time to come, to move away from substantial reliance on foreign funding. Some forms&#13;
of program activity, however, do involve less external funding than others. Revolving loan funds, for&#13;
instance, maximize local effort and recycle money within the economy.&#13;
R.      Project Sustainability&#13;
55.     Inflation has been mentioned as a major factor. Political and social stability are key elements&#13;
of sustainability.&#13;
56.     The 1995 Feasibility Study on Enterprise Development makes the point that sustainability, at&#13;
least in the agricultural area, may be enhanced by giving in-kind contributions (seeds, fertilizers, fuel and&#13;
the like) with repayment pegged to agricultural output calculated in hard currency.&#13;
57.     Another of the factors contributing to project sustainability is the gestation and implementation&#13;
periods required. This is an issue that the Bank will need to consider in relation to any expectation of&#13;
quick return. An evaluation of the UNHCR's Tajikistan small enterprise development projects is&#13;
instructive when it calls attention to the contradiction between quick impact and long term development.&#13;
58.     Conflict resolution and peace building are matters of urgent need. Though virtually all NGOs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136-&#13;
claim to be non-discriminatory as far as employment and other project benefits are concerned, few have&#13;
explicit and practiced strategies for addressing social conflict. The USAID PVO evaluation notes,&#13;
however, that the SCF (US) has "been among the leading practitioners of the art". The May, 1996 Bank&#13;
Mission found a general awareness of the problems of social conflict among NGOs with which it met,&#13;
though it did not detect much NGO programming activity in the area. This having been said, there is a&#13;
UNDP sponsored pilot project operated by UN volunteers. (An evaluation of the project was underway&#13;
at the time of the Mission's visit.)&#13;
S.      Staff capacity&#13;
59.     There is an abundance of well educated and talented local people available in Tajikistan.&#13;
Though most of these are not experienced in the design and management of development projects and&#13;
programs, many have found work with NGOs and have proved themselves very adaptable.&#13;
60.     Because of the conditions of living and working in Tajikistan, foreign NGO staff have tended&#13;
to stay for rather short periods of time, thus contributing to a turnover problem. This issue has been&#13;
complicated by the change in role experienced as a result of coming to the country as relief agencies and&#13;
more recently having tried to make a transition to development. The staff who are suitable for a relief&#13;
operation are often not those most appropriate for a development program.&#13;
T.      Transition from Relief to Development&#13;
61.     The shift from relief to development is frequently not an easy one for NGOs whose orientation&#13;
and experience is in relief programming. Even though these agencies may be extremely professional and&#13;
competent in what they do, and though they are able to employ some needed expertise for development&#13;
projects, they do not necessarily have the broader institutional awareness and support capacity which more&#13;
seasoned development NGOs possess and use to good effect. This experiential gap showed itself in such&#13;
areas as public participation in the planning, design and management of projects. Some organizations lack&#13;
an intuitive and methodological grasp of how to proceed, simply because it is not part of their experience.&#13;
U.      Geographical Limitations&#13;
62.     The other impediment is very much related to the foregoing point. Most of the present NGO&#13;
projects are to be found in areas where the 1992-93 civil conflict occurred. These, in other words, are&#13;
the parts of the country where their experience has been acquired. As a result, NGO relief, reconstruction&#13;
and development projects are unevenly distributed throughout Tajikistan. "Scaling-up" through replication&#13;
of activities in other areas, and, more especially, starting entirely new activities in new areas, are risky&#13;
options and are steps which most NGOs would take very cautiously. The presence of NGOs in certain&#13;
regions but not in others is an additional problem when it comes to distributing activities and benefits in&#13;
an equitable fashion throughout the country. Moreover, this is a problem which is unlikely to be entirely&#13;
solved in the short run.&#13;
V.      Factors Contributing to/Constraining Scaling-up&#13;
63.     Money is an obvious factor. Stable or unstable economic conditions constitute another set of&#13;
factors. If prices of inputs and/or products vary wildly or unpredictably, they negatively affect&#13;
investment, production and sales and hinder any consideration of "scaling-up".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
64.     The management capacity of NGOs themselves. On the surface, there is no reason to doubt that&#13;
the organizations proposing "scaled-up" activities can manage what they claim to be able to do. However,&#13;
the ability of each organization to manage and be accountable for projects undertaken is something that&#13;
can be addressed closer to the time of actual decisions.&#13;
65.     In addition to management capacity are the questions of orientation and expertise. These too&#13;
are aspects that need careful assessment when considering potential projects to support. One general&#13;
observation is that most of the foreign NGOs operating in Tajikistan came in an emergency relief role&#13;
during or after the 1992-93 civil conflict. Some of these are organizations which have evolved over many&#13;
years both a developmental and an emergency response capacity and practice. Historically, however,&#13;
others have been known almost exclusively as relief organizations. In the Tajikistan context, some have&#13;
advanced farther than others in redirecting their programs to development.&#13;
W.      Examples of "Scaling-up" Activities&#13;
66.     A reading of various reports on NGO activities in Tajikistan would suggest a number of&#13;
possibilities. Micro-enterprise development assisted through credit schemes is one such. The SCF (US)&#13;
Group Guaranteed Lending Program, for instance, has proved so successful in Khatlon Region that the&#13;
agency is considering replicating it in other parts of the country. The AKF Fund for Economic&#13;
Development is presently considering the establishment of a small credit scheme to begin in Gorno-&#13;
Badakshan and, depending on experience, expand to other parts of Tajikistan.&#13;
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: MEASURES TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE BANK/NGO&#13;
COLLABORATION&#13;
67.     Representatives of the foreign NGO community in Tajikistan have, by and large, had no&#13;
experience working with the World Bank; the Government of Tajikistan has had little more; and NGOs&#13;
and the GOT have, to date, had what might be termed a distant relationship. There will, therefore, have&#13;
to be effective means of communication and co-ordination between and among the parties and some&#13;
deliberate mutual confidence-building.&#13;
68.     Because the proposed loan will be provided from the Bank to the GOT, both parties will have&#13;
to agree on the basic terms of the agreement and the purposes for which the money will be spent.&#13;
Government, for its part, will have to be satisfied that the projects reflect the best possible national&#13;
priorities, and the Bank will need to ensure consistency with its own purposes as well as probity and&#13;
accountability.&#13;
69.     Notwithstanding the tripartite nature of the relationship which will have to be worked out, there&#13;
is much to be said for an "arm's length" project management facility. Indeed, the credibility of the&#13;
mechanism, at least in the eyes of participating NGOs and perhaps others in addition, may well depend&#13;
on this arrangement. The facility will need to be and be seen to be honest, efficient and competent.&#13;
Though it will have to adhere to the policies laid down and agreed upon and be accountable for its&#13;
actions, it will need to be free from day-to-day interference.&#13;
70.     The possible contradiction between this sort of "arm's length" facility and the desirability of&#13;
developing capacity within Government is one that is sufficiently obvious as to require comnment. Given&#13;
all the problems of setting up a mechanism within the GOT which would satisfy the tests suggested by&#13;
the foregoing point, and which could be able to operate quickly, one is led to the conclusion that this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138-&#13;
relatively short-term PPAP will need an independent management. Of course, all parties will need to&#13;
agree.&#13;
71.         Since what is proposed is largely uncharted territory, at least in Tajikistan, experience will need&#13;
to be assessed and, if necessary, plans amended. An NGO advisory body could be a very useful device&#13;
to provide needed input whilst reassuring the participating organizations.&#13;

ANNEX L&#13;
REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN&#13;
PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
KEY INDICATORS FOR MONITORING AND INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.         An independent evaluation of the Project would assess overall performance against&#13;
its objectives of (a) impact on household incomes and (b) capacity building. It would provide a&#13;
comprehensive and independent analysis of the results of the projects and the efficiency of the&#13;
use of available resources, and derive lessons to be learned. The evaluation is designed so as to&#13;
ensure both that its findings are independent and reliable, and also that it is conducted in a&#13;
participatory way (involving both implementors and beneficiaries) that will maximize learning.&#13;
2.         Such an evaluation has particular importance for a pilot project with the express aim&#13;
of charting a path for expanded future investments in poverty alleviation, in a country where the&#13;
Bank has as yet little implementation experience. An evaluation, conducted at mid term and&#13;
completion, would enable three key things: (i) ensure at mid-term that lessons learnt in the first&#13;
Project component are consolidated and incorporated in the second; and (ii) provide a "lessons&#13;
learned" context for the preparation of a follow-up project based on the second component, and&#13;
(iii) provide important pointers for future more specialized sector work including infrastructure,&#13;
health, education and micro-credit.&#13;
3.         The overall evaluation would verify and integrate the results of separate evaluations&#13;
of the individual components and sub-components of the Project (although its scope would not&#13;
necessarily be restricted by them), and on the results of monitoring incorporated in each&#13;
component. In order to allow this to happen, key indicators need to be established that can be&#13;
measured in a compatible fashion across both components of the Project at three points in time:&#13;
baseline, mid-term and end-of-project. For this reason, the evaluation is termed "integrated".&#13;
The remainder of this annex covers the three related topics of key objective indicators, the&#13;
conduct of the integrated evaluation, and monitoring indicators.&#13;
OBJECTIVE INDICATORS&#13;
4.         Key objective indicators would be measured and maintained by the Project in order&#13;
to track, in a consistent and comparable fashion, the essentials of performance against objectives.&#13;
The key objective indicators are summarized below in Table 1, and discussed in the following&#13;
paragraphs. The first Project objective of impact on the incomes of the poor would be measured&#13;
across all sub-components by five key indicators, of which two would indicate the extent to which&#13;
this objective has been met in a cost effective and participatory fashion. In addition, each sub-&#13;

component would be evaluated according to three specific indicators relating to the strategic entry&#13;
point selected (e.g. shelter, micro-credit, agricultural production of female-headed households,&#13;
agricultural reform), that address in particular aspects of impact, coverage and sustainability. The&#13;
second Project objective of capability building would be measured by two general indicators&#13;
across all components, with a third relating specifically to the training of TASIF staff. Thus each&#13;
sub-component would be evaluated on ten indicators, of which seven are common to the Project,&#13;
and three specific to the sub-component. An additional capacity-building indicator is included&#13;
for the second component. These indicators, and the specific measures and instruments to&#13;
compile them, would be refined in a pilot baseline exercise .&#13;
A.    Poverty Impact Indicators&#13;
5.    It is difficult in situations such as Tajikistan to measure household incomes reliably,&#13;
owing to the importance of non-monetary items. The social assessment pointed to three key&#13;
proxy indicators that were highly sensitive to household poverty levels and appear suitable for&#13;
generalization across all sub-components (Annex F). Food security and nutrition is the single&#13;
best measure of household economic status and purchasing power, food being the largest budget&#13;
item for poor households. Food insecurity needs to be measured in its dimensions of incidence,&#13;
depth and seasonality. The nutritional status of children can be measured by standard rapid&#13;
survey techniques, such as MUAC (mid upper-arm circumference) used extensively by UNICEF.&#13;
(Two sub-components whose design permits the direct measurement of household incomes on&#13;
a small scale are identified in the next section).&#13;
6.     Clothing, especially shoes for children, is the second priority of poor households,&#13;
particularly in areas subject to winter cold.&#13;
7.     Shelter and fuel is the third key household incomes proxy indicator. The availability of&#13;
domestic fuel for cooking, and for heating during the winter months, is a critical concern of poor&#13;
families.  Local scales should be constructed for standards of overcrowding in sleeping&#13;
accommodation, together with a simple score for shelter quality (leaky roof, no windows, no&#13;
flooring etc.). An indicator of household durables (beds, mattresses etc.) might be added.&#13;
8.     A common or compatible calculation of cost-effectiveness would show  cost per&#13;
beneficiary for certain types of specified or measured benefits.&#13;
9.     An indicator of community participation would show the scale and intensity of local&#13;
involvement in the planning, implementation, financing and monitoring of programs. Community&#13;
participation is seen primarily as an approach rather than an objective. However, a participatory&#13;
approach was an important criterion for the selection of programs for scaling up in the first&#13;
Project component and is expected to be a prominent feature of TASIF microprojects in the&#13;
second component. Moreover, the close relationship between local powerlessness and poverty&#13;
revealed by the social assessment points to community participation in poverty alleviation&#13;
activities, together with institutional capacity-building (discussed below), as being an important&#13;
indicator of social capital formation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
B.     Specific program indicators&#13;
10.    The performance of each program would be evaluated according to three key indicators&#13;
specific to the objectives of that program. While each program would have its range of additional&#13;
indicators for monitoring and individual internal evaluations, the three specific indicators are&#13;
selected primarily to measure the aspects of coverage, delivery of the specific benefit, and longer&#13;
term sustainability.&#13;
11.   The shelter program has as its main objective to assist 2,000 returned families with&#13;
shelter in five districts. Beneficiary selection would ensure the inclusion of the neediest and most&#13;
vulnerable groups, including female headed households and ethnic minorities.  Locally-&#13;
manufactured tiles would be used in place of asbestos sheeting. The three specific indicators&#13;
therefore measure (i) the quantity of shelter improved as a result of the project and the number&#13;
of households benefiting, in proportion to the overall identified need (ii) the inclusion of poor and&#13;
vulnerable categories of households as beneficiaries; and (iii) the adoption of tile technology.&#13;
12.    The micro-credit program aims to extend a group savings and credit guarantee scheme&#13;
to 3,750 poor women in 250 groups, and to build institutional capacity. The three specific&#13;
indicators would measure (i) the active loan portfolio, comprising the number of beneficiaries,&#13;
the loan volume and the repayment rates, indicating the extent to which poor women are able to&#13;
access the benefit; (ii) the change in household incomes as a result of the project, and (iii) the&#13;
creation of productive micro-enterprises as a result. The measurement of household incomes,&#13;
impractical for application across the Project, is feasible within the restricted context of this&#13;
program by virtue of its regular monitoring, and will allow testing of simple and inexpensive&#13;
methods of investigating household budgets. The creation of productive micro-enterprises is an&#13;
important indicator of the future sustainability and replicability, showing the productive use of&#13;
household credit as investment, rather than for short-term consumption needs. The important&#13;
component of institution-building is captured by a general indicator.&#13;
13.     The Female-Headed Households program would provide support for household food&#13;
production to 3,700 female-headed households to improve food security and incomes. The three&#13;
specific indicators selected are (i) the number of participating households; (ii) household&#13;
incomes, for the same reason as in the micro-credit program, and (iii) food productivity. The&#13;
range of institutional and group formation benefits, including community day care centers,&#13;
schools and access to local services would be captured either in the first specific indicator, or in&#13;
the general indicators of community participation and institutional capacity.&#13;
14.    The agricultural reform program aims to increase food crop production and productivity&#13;
in six of seven districts in Gorno-Badakhshan, by bringing additional land into cultivation through&#13;
small scale self-help irrigation channels. This would benefit 1,600 resource-poor farming&#13;
households. The three specific indicators would measure the (i) the land development potential&#13;
(length of channels constructed and potential command area realized); (ii) actual land development&#13;
(number of hectares developed for cultivation, number of households benefiting; and (iii) actual&#13;
increase in food production and productivity by family and unit area. The evaluation would take&#13;
into account that the land development schedule extends for several years beyond the life of the&#13;
Project, and that therefore the benefit stream for some may commence after Project completion.&#13;

C.    Capacity building indicators&#13;
15.    The second Project objective of capacity building is to strengthen in country capacity to&#13;
develop and implement poverty alleviation programs through (i) development of TASIF as a&#13;
central organization to fund and provide technical support for microprojects; and (ii) through the&#13;
first Project component, to build up local community, NGO and local government capacity to&#13;
initiate and organize poverty alleviation programs at local level.&#13;
16.    Three indicators would be used to measure and evaluate Project performance and the&#13;
achievement of this objective: (i) the development of national and local institutional capacity to&#13;
implement participatory poverty alleviation programs; (ii) the number of national and local&#13;
government officials trained in project identification, proposal preparation and community&#13;
participation, together with the number of proposals received by TASIF, and (iii) the number of&#13;
TASIF staff trained in these skills. The first two of these indicators are common to both&#13;
components of the program, while the third is specific to the second component.&#13;
17.   The institutional capacity indicator is both qualitative and quantitative, and must be&#13;
measured at several levels:&#13;
A.    Each of the programs in the first Projct component has a specific local&#13;
institutional objective which is both a means and an end: participation through&#13;
community-based organizations and associations of beneficiaries. The work&#13;
groups of the shelter program, the micro-credit groups and umbrella NGO, the&#13;
associations of female headed households and the managements of day care&#13;
centers and schools, the local farmers' groups negotiating irrigation channels, all&#13;
play an important part in empowering the poor and marginalized to organize to&#13;
improve their conditions.   They help rebuild civil society and ensure&#13;
sustainability of process and impact in poverty alleviation. The indicator at this&#13;
level would measure scale (size, geographical and social coverage), scope and&#13;
institutional strength. The design of an instrument and a method to capture this&#13;
aspect objectively, in the context of the diversity of organizations emerging will&#13;
be a challenge for the baseline evaluation to resolve.&#13;
B.    At the second tier, the institutional capacity of local government officials, and&#13;
local or national NGOs to target, appraise, implement and monitor poverty&#13;
alleviation programs can be determined by simple institutional assessments on a&#13;
common checklist.&#13;
C.    At the third tier of TASIF itself, the key measures of capacity would be results&#13;
against its central objective, the ability to channel investments through&#13;
community microprojects for poverty alleviation, and to ensure and account for&#13;
the results.&#13;
18.   The second key capacity building indicator is trained officials. This indicator would&#13;
capture the number and geographical distribution of national and local government officials and&#13;
NGO officials trained in project identification, proposal preparation and community participation.&#13;
The indicator would measure training effort (person-days, cost) against intended results, such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
the number, quality and distribution of proposals received by TASIF, or changes in knowledge,&#13;
attitudes and practice. Measured across the Project, this indicator would capture the extent to&#13;
which the four NGO programs, and TASIF itself, have contributed lessons, demonstration,&#13;
training for replication of their successes over a wider geographical and institutional canvas.&#13;
Additionally, each training event should have a simple internal evaluation as standard quality&#13;
control practice.&#13;
19.    The third key capacity building indicator is training within TASIF itself, the only&#13;
indicator in Table 1 is not measured "across the board". As with the previous indicator, this&#13;
indicator should measure not only training effort but training results in terms of knowledge,&#13;
attitudes and practice that contribute to the organization's mission and performance.&#13;
20.    The above set of indicators would facilitate and provide a sound foundation for an&#13;
integrated and overall evaluation and should therefore be emphasized in monitoring. The&#13;
integrated evaluation, however, would not be limited or determined by these indicators.&#13;
MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
21.    Each program has specified its own monitoring indicators, which have four main&#13;
purposes: management of implementation, triggering disbursements, tracking impact, and&#13;
providing a foundation for subsequent evaluation. The range of these indicators, and how they&#13;
would be measured, is shown in Table 4 at the end of this Annex.&#13;
D.    Establishing a baseline (May 1997)&#13;
22.    To assess the Project's overall impact requires a baseline study, that would allow the key&#13;
objective indicators in Table 1 to be measured in a compatible fashion across the Project's several&#13;
programs. The first of two main steps to accomplish this is to develop, through workshops and&#13;
pilot field exercises, instruments and procedures to operationalize these indicators. By the time&#13;
of Project approval [April-May 1997], measurement of the key indicators in Table 1 would have&#13;
been pilot tested through a workshop and field exercises that would bring together the NGOs, the&#13;
TASIF monitoring and evaluation officer and relevant local consultants or research organizations&#13;
under expert technical assistance. The indicators would be not only expert derived, but would&#13;
include indicators selected in consultation with local commnities and capable of being measured&#13;
by them;&#13;
23.   Having agreed and tested measurement of the indicators and constructed a suitable sample&#13;
frame6', quantitative and qualitative baseline data would then be collected and analyzed by the&#13;
four NGOs and by TASIF for the first batch of 10-15 micro-projects, to establish quantified&#13;
measures. The inclusion of TASIF in the baseline exercises would improve learning from the&#13;
first to the second Project components, and facilitate the setting up of a fuller beneficiary&#13;
assessment for later TASIF micro-projects.&#13;
6/ A 10 per cent sample of direct beneficiaries, plus a control group of suitable size, seems appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
MANAGEMENT OF INTEGRATED EVALUATION&#13;
A.    Objectives&#13;
24.    The integrated evaluation would determine the extent to which the Project had achieved&#13;
its objectives, and particularly evaluate the following aspects, without necessarily being limited&#13;
by them:&#13;
A.    design (needs identification, selection of intervention strategy, targeting)&#13;
B.     social and geographical targeting&#13;
C.     impact&#13;
D.    sustainability (of process and of impact)&#13;
E.     community participation&#13;
F.     cost effectiveness, relating the identified benefits to resources invested&#13;
G.    replicability&#13;
B.     Design and method&#13;
25.    The evaluation has been designed in order to ensure the following features: (i) the&#13;
independence, multi-disciplinary professionalism, integrity and reliability of its conclusions;&#13;
(ii) the effective participation of beneficiaries and implementors; and (iii) the generation of&#13;
maximum learning and capacity building. Any tension between the first objective (independence&#13;
and integrity) and the second (participation of implementors and beneficiaries) would be resolved&#13;
by ensuring a collegial approach under an independent leader.&#13;
26.    A three-week mid-term evaluation would be conducted about June-July 1998, linking and&#13;
coordinating the findings of the separate evaluations of the four NGO programs comprising the&#13;
first Project component. It would verify through field visits the validity of key monitoring&#13;
indicators and the essential accuracy of the quarterly progress reports, and review the training&#13;
materials under preparation. The progress of the TASIF MIS would be assessed against these&#13;
findings, with particular emphasis on (i) assisting with the identification of simple and effective&#13;
monitoring and evaluation instruments, and the inclusion of community-based indicators; and (ii)&#13;
the design of the TASIF microprojects beneficiary assessment. The design and selection of&#13;
microprojects would also be evaluated. In reviewing Project progress against key indicators, the&#13;
mid-term evaluation should pay particular attention to an initial institutional capacity assessment&#13;
of TASIF, in order to allow time for recommendations to be taken into consideration during the&#13;
second year of the Project.&#13;
27.    The focus of the mid-term evaluation would be on lessons learned and Project course&#13;
correction. TASIF, local communities and NGOs would all have the opportunity of mutual&#13;
learning and education.&#13;
28.    A final four-week evaluation would be conducted in June-July 1999, combining the&#13;
evaluations of the four NGO programs, a selection of the TASIF microprojects, the beneficiary&#13;
assessment, and an institutional assessment of TASIF. The evaluation team would make site&#13;
visits to a selection2' of TASIF microprojects to verify monitoring and reporting procedures&#13;
1   A 20 percent sample of projects is recommended. It would be important to ensure a representative range of examples&#13;
of success or difficulty in implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
against observations. The central questions to be addressed, on the basis of an analysis of key&#13;
indicators, are: (i) the justification of continuing or expanding investments in poverty alleviation&#13;
through participatory micro-projects; (ii) the lessons learned that would maximize the cost-&#13;
effective impact and sustainability of such investments; and (iii) the capacity of TASIF to manage&#13;
such investments effectively.  The final evaluation would also relate its findings to the&#13;
expectations and judgments of the PAD, so as to derive lessons for future project preparation.&#13;
C.    Management and inplementation&#13;
29.   The evaluation exercise, both mid-term and final, would be contracted competitively by&#13;
TASIF, subject to no objection from the Bank, to a suitably experienced and qualified lead&#13;
individual or organization who has not been involved in project design, preparation or&#13;
implementation. The evaluation leader would, in consultation with TASIF and the implementing&#13;
NGOs, assemble a multi-disciplinary team of eight well-qualified local and international experts,&#13;
ensuring a sufficient range of expertise to cover the project content: poverty and its alleviation,&#13;
construction, micro-credit, gender, agriculture, institutional capacity and MIS training,&#13;
community participation. Of the team, three or four international members would be proposed,&#13;
one by each of the international NGOs, and paid for from their program budget. At least four&#13;
local counterparts would be selected by the team leader and paid for from TASIF's budget.&#13;
Interested relevant donors might also be invited to participate.  TASIF's Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Officer would actively assist the team with research documentation and analysis.&#13;
30.   The evaluation team would work as an interdisciplinary team, reviewing each of the&#13;
programs, and the TASIF microprojects, with full access to all project sites, personnel and&#13;
documentation, and the ability to conduct their own spot field research. The team leader would&#13;
be responsible for using all of the inputs and reports from the team members, and would have&#13;
full responsibility for the end-product.&#13;
31.   In addition, the team would be expected to constitute local evaluation teams for brief&#13;
participatory, on-site evaluations. These local teams should include community representatives,&#13;
local government officials, other knowledgeable or local persons, and representatives of the&#13;
implementing agency.&#13;
32.   The team would have access to all relevant TASIF and NGO records. and would be&#13;
expected to ensure physical visits to project sites in each region of the country.&#13;
D.    Outputs&#13;
33.   The consultant would produce a report in Russian and in English for each of the three&#13;
evaluation components that would be confidential to TASIF, the implementing NGOs and the&#13;
Bank. TASIF and the implementing NGOs would ensure dissemination of relevant findings to&#13;
participating communities.&#13;
34.   These reports would be made available in final form one month after the evaluation.&#13;

PILOT POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
1.    The Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project (PPAP) would increase the incomes of some of the&#13;
poor in Tajikistan and improve their access to essential economic and social services. This would&#13;
be done by (a) scaling up selected existing NGO programs that are having a positive impact on&#13;
poverty alleviation, and (b) developing the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (TASIF) as a&#13;
demand driven, cost-effective and transparent funding mechanism that would respond to proposals&#13;
from the local level to carry out small investments in social and economic infrastructure. It would&#13;
also finance the implementation of 70 microprojects throughout Tajikistan.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.    The executing agency for the PPAP would be the newly established TASIF. The TASIF&#13;
would be created by Presidential Resolution with the necessary autonomy and authority to enable&#13;
it to execute the project according to the Legal Credit Agreement. The TASIF would operate&#13;
according to a detailed Operational Manual which would provide information on the organization&#13;
and structure of the TASIF. A draft of the Operational Manual would be prepared by TASIF&#13;
prior to Project Effectiveness based on those used in other social funds and input from the World&#13;
Bank and technical assistance. The Operational Manual would detail the implementation&#13;
arrangements for microprojects as well as the responsibilities of the TASIF in monitoring,&#13;
supervision and reporting on the NGO programs supported by the PPAP.&#13;
3.    The TASIF would enter into service contracts with each of the NGOs to be supported&#13;
through the PPAP. Attachments to the service contracts would stipulate the procedures,&#13;
benchmarks and monitoring indicators to be followed by the NGOs for implementation of the&#13;
NGO programs. Currently the TASIF Executive Director and the leadership of the NGOs are&#13;
finalizing the details of the proposals and reaching consensus on the delegation of responsibilities&#13;
for financial management, monitoring and reporting.&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
4.    Given the nature of the project, it is difficult to estimate of procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures and schedules. These would be discussed with the World Bank mission and the NGOs&#13;
during the forthcoming appraisal mission. The procurement arrangements for the NGO programs&#13;
would be specified in attachments to the service contracts. Procurement arrangements for the&#13;
microprojects and purchasing of equipment, furniture and consulting contracts would be specified&#13;
in the Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
Financing&#13;
5.    The total project costs are estimated at US$11 million, of which IDA would finance&#13;
US$10 million. The Government of Tajikistan and communities would contribute to the costs as&#13;
well.&#13;
Project Accounting and Monitoring&#13;
6.    By project effectiveness, the TASIF would have hired staff and acquired equipment and&#13;
technology to enable it to monitor and account for the use of PPAP funds. External auditing&#13;
would be conducted on an annual basis. A beneficiary impact assessment would be undertaken&#13;
to understand the impact of the project on poor communities.&#13;
Completion of the PIP&#13;
7.    The TASIF will complete its Project Implementation Plan by appraisal of the project. The&#13;
TASIF will specify critical factors that could affect the success of the project, the role of the&#13;
World Bank during project implementation, and a detailed schedule of implementation&#13;
activities.&#13;

            Tajikistan - Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The development objective of the Pilot
            Poverty Alleviation Project is to increase on a sustainable
            basis the incomes of the poor, and to improve their access
            to essential economic and social services.  The Project
            objectives are to: (1) have a modest though quick impact on
            the incomes of some of the poor; and (2) develop capacity at
            the national and local level to implement participatory
            approaches to poverty alleviation.  The Project's two
            components are: scaling-up of on-going nongovernmental
            organization poverty alleviation programs; and developing
            the Tajikistan Social Investment Fund (TASIF). The first
            component further consists of: (1) assisting returned
            families in the self-help reconstruction of their homes ;
            (2) expanding existing services and extending activities of
            the micro-credit program to other districts; (3)
            strengthening the capacity of social services to support
            female-headed households with access to and ownership of
            agricultural assets, and with grants for day-are centers and
            schools; (4) expanding the agricultural reform program; and
            increasing staple food crop production; and (5) continued
            sponsoring of these activities, if they or similar programs
            modeled after them are successful.  The development of the
            Social Investment Fund has two sub-components.  In the
            first, TASIF will be developed by providing equipment,
            vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training, technical
            assistance, and financing for monitoring and evaluation.
            The second sub-component implements pilot micro-projects in
            order to train staff and test and modify the targeting,
            promotion, appraisal, approval, supervision, monitoring and
            evaluating procedures written in the operational manual.
