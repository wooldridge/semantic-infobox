For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;

the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 10,850&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 55&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 51*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

tells only part of the story, so do changes in that ranking.          This measure shows how far on average an economy is&#13;
Yearly movements in rankings can provide some indication              from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

      If the municipality asks for changes to be made to the&#13;
      architectural designs during the approval process, these changes&#13;
      should be reflected in the engineering and landscaping projects&#13;
      as well. For final approval, these project plans are submitted to&#13;
      the municipal project branch, for static, sanitation facility, heating&#13;
      and heat insulation, and landscaping project plans to the Turkish&#13;

      The company requests a building permit from the licensing&#13;
      branch of the municipality. The approved design, engineering&#13;
      drawings, and other necessary documents (described in the&#13;
      previous procedures) must be attached to this request. The&#13;
      company must pay the fees before receiving the building permit&#13;
      and starting foundation work.&#13;
&#13;
      The fee schedule is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
      1-25 sq. m.: 3.00 TRY / sq. m&#13;

      Building permits are usually issued 1 -- 2 months after&#13;
      submission of the application. The law provides for a statutory&#13;
      time limit of 30 days for the municipality issuing the permit.&#13;
      There are frequent complaints from applicants about not&#13;
      receiving the building permit within the specified time.&#13;
&#13;
      Following the building permit issuance, the municipal building&#13;
      control authority will randomly conduct inspections during the&#13;
      construction on site, in addition to private inspection.&#13;

      As far as construction works are concerned, once they are&#13;
      completed, the site (i.e., the workplace) will be closed. Upon&#13;
      completion date, there must not be any outstanding social&#13;
      security premium debt arising from the employment of the&#13;
      construction workers on site. Therefore, the contractor must&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;
when outages exceed a certain cap).                        companies and national regulators on SAIDI and SAIFI.&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

with the associated time and cost, are summarized&#13;

       The buyer conducts a non-encumbrance check on the property&#13;
&#13;
       Although not mandated by law, non-encumbrance check is a must&#13;
       Procedure without which buyers do not proceed with the transfer&#13;
       process. The buyer almost always checks whether or not the property is&#13;
       free of liens and encumbrances. For this, the seller would need to obtain&#13;
       the document showing that the property is free of disputes.&#13;
       By law, title deeds are open to anyone who legitimizes their interest.&#13;
       However, in practice the records are not accessible to the public: the&#13;
       buyer can obtain this document only with a power attorney of the seller.&#13;
       Therefore, this document is typically obtained by the seller who is often    1 day                no cost&#13;
   1&#13;
       accompanied by the buyer. For transactions that are undertaken by&#13;
       lawyers, this procedure is taken care of by lawyers (who have the power&#13;
       of attorney from the seller and have a legal right to search titles). The&#13;
       information is computerized; it takes minutes to check and is free of&#13;
       charge. If the buyer or seller wish to obtain a copy of the records&#13;
       displaying the status of the property, a fee of TL 7.20 per page applies.&#13;

      If a â&#128;&#156;compulsory earthquake insurance policyâ&#128;&#157; had not been issued for&#13;
      the building, one must be prepared since in practice, when selling the&#13;
      building or asking for a loan on it, it is usually required. The cost of this&#13;
      insurance policy depends on the features such as the area of the building&#13;
      and the place thereof, and the insurance brokers automatically calculate&#13;
      it. If there is an existing "compulsory earthquake insurance policy" which                    no cost (unless a&#13;
      is still valid at the date of the sale (i.e. if the term of the insurance policy    1 day     new insurance is&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

                                 The most common and practical way for the hotel to proceed is the&#13;
                          postponement of bankruptcy procedure. Article 377 of Turkish Commercial Code&#13;
                            and Article 179 of the Turkish Enforcement and Bankruptcy Code regulate this&#13;
                          procedure. The debtor must propose a rehabilitation plan. The court may decide&#13;
                            to grant up to one year for the debtor to attempt rehabilitation based on the&#13;
            liquidation      proposed plan. This period can be extended up to 4 years in total. Upon the&#13;
              (after an     decision on postponement of bankruptcy, no legal proceeding (including the&#13;
Proceedin&#13;
            attempt at     proceedings for the collection of the public receivables) can be initiated against&#13;
g&#13;
          reorganization) the debtor and the pending proceedings will be deferred. If the court agrees to&#13;
                              postpone the bankruptcy, it will also appoint an administrator in the same&#13;
                          decision. The maximum postponement period is one year, during which time the&#13;
                          administrator will supervise the business. In most cases, similar to the case study,&#13;
                            the debtor does not achieve the projections of the rehabilitation plan and the&#13;
                                            court will commence liquidation proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
                       If the debtor fails to achieve its goals shown in the rehabilitation report, then the&#13;
Outcome piecemeal sale court will rule for opening its bankruptcy. Therefore in that case it would not be&#13;
                               possible for the debtor to continue operating as a going concern.&#13;
&#13;
                               After several months of procedural matters and hearings, the court will grant a&#13;
                                 one-year postponement of bankruptcy period to Mirage. This period can be&#13;
                               extended up to four years depending on the achievement of the rehabilitation&#13;
                                plan. In the case of Mirage, the postponement period will last 3 years in total.&#13;
                                  After the third year, Mirage can request an extension of the postponement&#13;
                                   period (another year), however, the court will likely deny this this request,&#13;
                                  because Mirage is not likely to comply with the financial projections of the&#13;
                               proposed rehabilitation plan. The court will declare Mirage bankrupt and notify&#13;

                                   inventory and financials of the company, review creditors' claims, prepare&#13;
                                creditors' list, organize creditors' meetings and facilitate the sale of the hotel's&#13;
                                              assets. The bankruptcy procedure will last 18 months.&#13;
                                   Given the recent restructuring of its commercial courts, pending cases are&#13;
                                  experiencing significant delays while case files are being reassigned to new&#13;
                               courts. It is however expected that this reform will speed up proceedings in the&#13;

                             The largest part of the expenses is government levies (4.55% for bankruptcy) and&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

practice across the entire sample of 36 indicators for 10     extreme outliers in the distributions of the rescaled data&#13;
Doing Business topics (the labor market regulation            for most component indicators (very few economies&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

the nonlinear transformation, an increase in the total tax&#13;
rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Turkey
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Turkey.
            To allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides
            data for other selected economies (comparator economies) for
            each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Turkey ranks 55. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
