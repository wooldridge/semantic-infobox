&#13;
Agenor, Pierre-Richard&#13;
(Notation: The World Bank Institute was formerly called the Economic Development Institute&#13;
(EDI), as reflected in some text)&#13;
&#13;
The Macroeconomic Management and Policy Division of EDI (EDIMP), in collaboration with&#13;
the Bank's Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network (PREM) and the&#13;
Research, Data &amp; Prospects Group of Development Economics &amp; Chief Economist&#13;
(DECRG), conducted a core course on Macroeconomic Management: New Methods and&#13;
Current Policy Issues in Abidjan, Ivory Coast from October 5-15, 1998. This was the fourth&#13;
offering of the Macroeconomic Management series in 1998, following the courses held earlier&#13;
in Washington, D.C., Kenya, and Turkey. The ten-day course of advanced macroeconomic&#13;
policy analysis was delivered through lectures in 11 specific thematic sessions, covering an&#13;
overview of theories, empirical evidences, and the latest policy issues. The course&#13;
particularly emphasized providing skills and tools for macroeconomic analysis and&#13;
econometric techniques through hands-on computer lab exercises. Instructors included&#13;
university professors and World Bank staff. A total of 42 participants attended the course,&#13;
representing economists and officials from Central Banks, Finance Ministries, the Asia&#13;
Development Bank, and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) conducted a Level I (participants' reaction) evaluation using&#13;
a participants' feedback questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. The first&#13;
section asked the extent to which the respondents were satisfied with the course content,&#13;
design, and delivery. The second section asked the level of respondents' knowledge about&#13;
course topics before and after the course, based on self-assessment. A 5-point Likert type&#13;
scale that ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum was used for each question. The&#13;
questionnaire was completed by 39 respondents, or 92.9% of the total participants. Five&#13;
respondents (12.8%) were women.&#13;
&#13;
The data analysis used a combination of 2 methods: (i) the descriptive statistics, including&#13;
mean ratings on the questionnaire; and (ii) a correlation analysis to examine the&#13;
associations among the various responses. For the correlation analysis, a Pearson's&#13;
product-moment correlation test was used. Test results in the form of correlation coefficients&#13;
range from Â­1.0 to 1.0. The higher the positive or negative coefficient, the stronger the&#13;
relationship. A coefficient of 0 indicates no association between the responses. Following is&#13;
a summary of the evaluation findings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Content and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 4.32 on a 5-point&#13;
        scale. Respondents indicated that the course was of high relevance to their current&#13;
        work (mean=4.44) and to their personal learning needs (mean=4.33). Among the&#13;
        highest ratings given by respondents were on the extent to which they found new&#13;
        sources of information useful for the future (mean=4.46), instructors' knowledge of the&#13;
        issues (mean=4.38), and training materials provided by the course (mean=4.36).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   l  Three questions about the course objectives revealed a difference between what the&#13;
      course stated to achieve in terms of its objectives and how respondents viewed the&#13;
      stated objectives were met in the end. When asked about the effectiveness of the&#13;
      presentation of course objectives at the beginning of the course and the extent to&#13;
      which the course content matched the announced objectives, respondents' scores&#13;
      exceeded 4.0 on a 5-point scale, 4.49 and 4.16, respectively. On the extent to which&#13;
      the course achieved the stated objectives, however, their rating was much lower&#13;
      (mean=3.79).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  A correlation test indicated that the respondents' perception of the extent to which the&#13;
      course achieved the stated objectives had a statistically significant positive&#13;
      relationship to 2 factors.* One was the respondents' view of their improvement in&#13;
      analytical skills (=.521). The other factor was their view of course instructors.&#13;
      Specifically, 5 aspects of instructors showed a significant positive association: the&#13;
      instructors' effectiveness in communicating their messages (=.636); their knowledge&#13;
      of the issues (=.616); the usefulness of their presentations (=.531); the quality of their&#13;
      answers (=.504); and the extent to which they presented a variety of viewpoints&#13;
      (=.417). The results indicated that the respondents who rated higher on their level of&#13;
      improvement in analytical skills, as well as on the instructors' communication and&#13;
      presentations skills, were more likely to give higher ratings on the course's&#13;
      achievement. Similarly, those who rated lower on these items were more likely to give&#13;
      lower ratings on this indicator. This suggests that the respondents' perception of their&#13;
      analytical skills and their views of instructors may have affected how much they felt&#13;
      the course objectives were met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  One aspect of course design that may require the course organizers' attention is the&#13;
      adequacy of the work load during the course duration (mean=3.13). Respondents'&#13;
      mean score of this indicator was the lowest among all course performance indicators.&#13;
      This questions was used in previous offerings of this core course where the scores&#13;
      were significantly higher (above 4.0). Since this was the first time such a relatively low&#13;
      score was achieved in this area, one explanation suggested by the Task Manager&#13;
      was the level of expertise among the participant group. Suspected difficulty with the&#13;
      material may have caused them to respond that the workload was heavy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Respondents' self-assessed knowledge ratings showed a positive gain in all 5 areas of&#13;
      skills for macroeconomic policy analysis after the course. Their pre-course ratings of&#13;
      the 5 items ranged between 1.78 and 2.38 on a 5-point scale, indicating that&#13;
      respondents had come to the course with very limited knowledge and skills in these&#13;
      areas. On 4 out of the 5 items, respondents' perceived knowledge exceeded 3.0 after&#13;
      the course, with a large gain in the percentage change: "The Maquette" increased by&#13;
      83%; "Models I-III" by 71%; "RMSM-X Model" by 63%; and time-series econometrics&#13;
      by 38%. One item, "VAR techniques," had a percentage gain of 45%; however, its&#13;
      post-course score remained at a level of below 3.0 (mean=2.82).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  On 11 theoretical topics, respondents' pre-course ratings all exceeded 3.0 out of 5.0,&#13;
      ranging between 3.05-3.68. Their post-course scores rose to the 3.95-4.26 range. The&#13;
      topic on "Financial liberalization and the sequencing of reforms" had the largest&#13;
      percentage increase of 30.2% after the course. Respondents' perceived knowledge&#13;
      was the highest on the topic of "Consumption, saving, and investment" at both the&#13;
      beginning (mean=3.68) and the end (mean=4.26) of the course.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    l  The previous course offering by the course organizers used a set of cognitively-based&#13;
       pre/post-tests to measure participants' learning (Level II). The present course,&#13;
       however, used only respondents' self-perceptions of their knowledge gains from the&#13;
       course, and therefore, did not attempt to measure the degree to which respondents&#13;
       actually learned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    l  EDIES will conduct a review of all 5 course offerings on Macroeconomic Management&#13;
       held in 1998 upon completion of the December course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*Respondents' perceived degree of course achievement was examined against each of the&#13;
different factors separately. Test results were significant at the .01 level.&#13;

            The macroeconomic management new methods
            and current policy issues in Abidjan, Ivory Coast from 5-15,
            1998 was the fourth offering of the macroeconomic management
            series in 1998, following the courses held earlier in
            Washington, D.C., Kenya, and Turkey. The ten-day course of
            advanced macroeconomic policy analysis was delivered through
            lectures in 11 specific thematic sessions, covering an
            overview of theories, empirical evidences, and the latest
            policy issues. The course particularly emphasized providing
            skills and tools for macroeconomic analysis and econometric
            techniques through hands-on computer lab exercises.
            Instructors included university professors and the World
            Bank staff. A total of 42 participants attended the course,
            representing economists and officials from Central Banks,
            Finance Ministries, the Asia Development Bank, and the World
            Bank. The EDI evaluation unit (EDIES) conducted a first
            level (participants' reaction) evaluation using a
            participants' feedback questionnaire. The questionnaire
            consisted of two sections. The first section asked the
            extent to which the respondents were satisfied with the
            course content, design, and delivery. The second section
            asked the level of respondents' knowledge about course
            topics before and after the course, based on self-assessment.
