            State enterprises : what remains ?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            After two decades of privatization, has
            government ownership and control of enterprises declined
            substantially? A rigorous assessment is difficult in the
            absence of systematic data on state enterprises. But ongoing
            research suggests that while privatization has helped reduce
            the state's role in some developing countries and
            regions, in most others the stock of state enterprises
            remains relatively large. State enterprises continue to play
            a major role in many developing regions and, in some
            sectors, across more or less all of them.
