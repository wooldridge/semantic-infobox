&#13;
                                     I.      BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
Objectiveof the Credit&#13;
&#13;
 1.     The Economic and Public Sector Reform Credit (EPSRC) was prepared in&#13;
2000 to assist the government in jumpstarting the implementation of Kenya's Interim&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and to improve the outlook for economic&#13;
growth and poverty reduction in the medium term. The immediate objective was to&#13;
contain the fragile macroeconomic situation and looming fiscal difficulties at the time,&#13;
including large net outflows of long and medium-term capital. The fiscal situation was&#13;
making it difficult to finance the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure needed to facilitate&#13;
private investment. The economy was stagnating, with loss of private sector confidence.&#13;
The overall situationwas exacerbatedby severe drought conditions during 1999/00.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The EPSRC was approved within the context of the 1998 CAS that had placed&#13;
IDA's assistanceto Kenya in the Low Case lending scenario in view of serious concerns&#13;
about economic governance, envisaging a three-year lending program of $150 million.&#13;
The CAS saw weak economic governance - referring to poor management of public&#13;
resources, corruption, weak rule of law, and uneven implementation of policy reforms        -&#13;
as central to weak economic performance. The CAS set out tough triggers for advancing&#13;
to a base case scenario involving progress in macroeconomic management, economic&#13;
governance, and portfolio performance.&#13;
&#13;
3.     In 1999-2000,the government took many actions that encouraged IDA to proceed&#13;
with preparation of the EPSRC. The government prepared the I-PRSP in consultation&#13;
with a broad range of Kenyan stakeholders and in collaboration with IDA and the IMF&#13;
and other development partners. Most importantly, the government appointed a credible&#13;
team consisting of skilled professionals drawn from the private sector and international&#13;
organizations to manage the reform effort. The team had been successfully working&#13;
unhindered for almost a year when the Credit was considered by the Board. The Credit&#13;
supported the reform program articulated by the Government in its Letter of&#13;
Development Policy (LDP) dated May 28,2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recognized the risks involved in proceeding with this operation and the Credit was&#13;
4.     The EPRSC was IDA's response to this new situation. However, IDA clearly&#13;
&#13;
designed with conditionality that required close monitoring of the technical and&#13;
governance issues. Conditionality was wider than immediate economic issues, including&#13;
the establishment of institutions supported by new legislation with long-term impact in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mind. The Credit instrument itself was designed as a three tranche operation so that IDA&#13;
 support was linked to program performance.&#13;
&#13;
The New Government and the Updated LDP&#13;
&#13;
 5.     In December 2002, Kenya saw an historic change in government from the&#13;
political party that had been in power ever since independence to the National Rainbow&#13;
Coalition (NARC). The new government came to power on an agenda of promoting good&#13;
govemance, economic reforms and improved social services, and it has quickly moved to&#13;
demonstrate its strong commitment to fighting corruption. Its initial focus has been on&#13;
setting up institutions for better govemance and for reversing the economic decline that&#13;
has continued over more than a decade.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The new government released in June 2003, the Economic Recovery Strategy for&#13;
Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS) describing its medium-term strategy for growth&#13;
and poverty reduction. The ERS draws upon the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper being&#13;
prepared by the Govemment. In May 2003, the Government also prepared an updated&#13;
LDP (attached to this document) that confirmed to IDA the direction in which the new&#13;
government wanted to move on economic reforms supported by the Credit. The updated&#13;
LDP demonstrates the new Government's commitment to the spirit of the reform&#13;
program supported by the Credit, describes its strategy in all the reform areas that were at&#13;
the core of the EPSRC, and commits it to well-defined actions within a specified time&#13;
frame. In its dialogue with the Government, IDA has agreed to give the Government&#13;
more time to reformulate its strategy, and to provide technical support where requested,&#13;
on the issues of civil service restructuring and private sector participation in the&#13;
commercial activities of public enterprises. The DCA will be amended to incorporate the&#13;
updated LDP.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements so far&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Credit amounting to SDR 113.1 million (equivalent to US$l50 million) was&#13;
envisioned to be disbursed in three tranches: one upon effectiveness and two subsequent&#13;
tranches. The first tranche of SDR 37.7 million (equivalent to US$50 million) was&#13;
released after the Credit became effective on August 15, 2000. Subsequently an IDA&#13;
reflows allocation for FY2000 amounting to SDR 2.5 million was approved and&#13;
disbursed in April 2001. Two tranches of SDR 37.7 million each were expected to be&#13;
released during 2000/01, at the latest by June 30, 2001, on the basis of performance&#13;
relative to agreed monitorable indicators. The two remaining tranches are yet to be&#13;
released due to delay in carrying out agreed actions. Following a request from the&#13;
government, the closing date of the Credit was extended for one year, from June 30, 2002&#13;
to June 30, 2003, on the basis of an agreed Action plan. The closing date was extended a&#13;
second time to 30 April 2004, following a request from the new government, on the basis&#13;
of an action plan incorporated in the updated LDP. Two IDA reflow allocations of SDR&#13;
1.15million and SDR 400,000 have been attached to the second tranche release.&#13;

&#13;
 8.      The DCA will be amended to incorporate the updated LDP by adding the words&#13;
 ",and an additional letter of developmentpolicy dated May 28, 2003 (hereinafter called&#13;
 the updated LDP)," to second line of paragraph (A) in the Preamble to the DCA. The&#13;
 amended paragraph in the Preamble will read as below:&#13;
&#13;
     WHEREAS: (A) the Association has received a letter of development policy&#13;
     (hereinafter called the LDP), and an additional letter of development policy&#13;
     dated May 28, 2003 (hereinafter called the updated LDP), from the Borrower&#13;
     describing a program of actions, objectives and policies designed to achieve&#13;
     structural adjustment of the Borrower's economy (hereinafter called the&#13;
     Program), declaring the Borrower's commitment to the execution of the&#13;
     Program, and requesting assistance from the Association in support of the&#13;
     program during the execution thereof; and&#13;
&#13;
                         111.   RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
9.      The new govemment inherited an economy with good macroeconomic stability&#13;
but very subdued economic activity. Nominal GDP grew by -0.2 percent in 2000, 1.2&#13;
percent in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The prospects are modest for 2003, partly&#13;
because of the recent terrorism alert which has adversely affected the tourism industry.&#13;
Inflation has remained under control and the overall inflation rate actually declined from&#13;
5.8 percent in 2001 to 1.9percent in 2002. Inflation increased in the first half of 2003 due&#13;
to increase in food and fuel prices, but has decelerated more recently, as supply side&#13;
pressures have eased. The exchange rate has been largely market-determined and&#13;
relatively stable. Helped by increasing horticulture and AGOA-induced exports and a fall&#13;
in imports, the balance of payments position has been comfortable in the past two years&#13;
and foreign exchange reserves are rising. In June 2003, official reserves covered 3.8&#13;
months of imports of goods and services compared with 3.2 months at the end of 2001.&#13;
The stock of external debt is low by international standards. Kenya is not eligible for&#13;
HPC relief under the current ratios for the initiative and external debt service payments&#13;
are on a falling trend.&#13;
&#13;
10.     However, there are underlying risks to macroeconomic stability. A key issue is&#13;
the high level of domestic debt which is more than 25% of GDP. Interest payments on&#13;
domestic debt are about 2.7 percent of GDP and account for 14 percent of total&#13;
government expenditure. Liabilities of parastatals arising from bank loans, overdue&#13;
pension contributions, and government guaranteed public borrowings are estimated to be&#13;
large and a significant source of contingent risks. Other fiscal risks arise from pending&#13;
bills and stalled projects. The financial sector is another potential source of instability.&#13;
The banking sector has about 30% non-performing loans and underprovisioning is an&#13;
issue. The government-controlled banks have about 50% non-performing loans.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Macroeconomic stability masks significant structural weaknesses in the economy&#13;
which have been behind the low growth rates during the past decade. More important&#13;
from a policy viewpoint is the structure of public spending which is highly skewed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
favor of recurrent wage-bill expenditure leaving little for investment in physical and&#13;
human capital and delivery of services. The lack of investment in the utilities and&#13;
infrastructure combined with their poor management has significantly constrained the&#13;
growth of the economy. Investment response to the improved governance environment&#13;
has been weak so far due to policy uncertainties. Addressing these structural issues is the&#13;
challenge that Kenya faces in its efforts to recover economic growth and reduce poverty.&#13;
&#13;
 12.    The ERS addresses many of these structural issues. It targets an annual GDP&#13;
growth rate of 4.7%, reducing poverty levels by 5% and creating 500,000jobs annually&#13;
during 2003-2007. This Strategy will provide the background for discussions at the&#13;
Consultative Group meeting to be held in November 2003. Following the CG meeting,&#13;
the ERS is expected to be revised and presented to the IDA and the Fund for Joint Staff&#13;
Assessment in December 2003. Main themes of the ERS are:&#13;
&#13;
        Strengtheninginstitutions for governance including implementation of the&#13;
        recently enacted Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act and The Public&#13;
        Officers Ethics Act, strengthening security and law and order;&#13;
    0   Rehabilitating and expanding physical infrastructure specifically the road network&#13;
        including rural access roads and energy sector;&#13;
        Improving access to and quality of education and health services;&#13;
        Improving the investment climate particularly for micro and small enterprises;&#13;
        and&#13;
    0  Restructuring public expenditures and improving their effectiveness.&#13;
IMF's relations&#13;
&#13;
13.    Kenya's previous three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and&#13;
Growth Facility (PRGF) was approved in August 2000 in an amount of SDR 190million.&#13;
After one withdrawal of SDR 33.6 million, the PRGF-supported program suffered major&#13;
setbacks in the late 2000 and never recovered. The program expired in August 2003. The&#13;
IMF has negotiated a new three-year arrangement under the PRGF in an amount&#13;
equivalent to SDR 175 million. The arrangement is scheduled to be considered by the&#13;
IMF Board on 21 November 2003. Seven disbursements are contemplated during the&#13;
three-year period.&#13;
&#13;
                  Iv. OVERALLPROGRESSONTHEREFORMPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
14.    Apart from maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, the Bank's EPSRC&#13;
supported reforms in five areas corresponding to key policy matters in the I-PRSP:&#13;
&#13;
   (i) Improving the governance framework. This included strengthening of anti-&#13;
   corruption machinery; procurement reforms involving issuance of new regulations&#13;
   and setting up a Directorate of Public Procurement; legal sector reforms to&#13;
   consolidate the independence of judiciary; and fully empowering the C&amp;AG as the&#13;
   supreme audit institution in the government;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     (ii) Civil service reforms. These reforms aimed at creating a smaller and more&#13;
     efficient system of public administration and reducing the wage bill to a manageable&#13;
     level. Some 32,000 employees were expected to be retrenched as part of this reform;&#13;
     (iii)Expenditwe management reforms. These reforms aimed at using MTEF to&#13;
     establish a hard budget constraint; strengthening budget monitoring and reporting;&#13;
     and restructuring expenditure in line with the I-PRSP priorities in the areas of&#13;
     agriculture, education, health and HIV/AIDS;&#13;
     (iv)Public enterprise reform and privatization. These reforms involved implementing&#13;
     the strategy for privatization in telecommunications, ports, railway, energy, water and&#13;
     sugar sectors; and&#13;
     (v) Private sector development. The reforms included measures to deal with&#13;
    inefficiencies in the institutional environment such as simplifying licensing&#13;
    procedures and strengthening of mechanisms for consultation between the&#13;
    government and the private sector.&#13;
15.      The reform program involved important institutional changes, preparation and&#13;
enactment of new legislation, and other politically hard decisions about civil service&#13;
retrenchment and privatization of infrastructure services. Progress was initially very slow.&#13;
The government had difficulty in moving on new legislation in a highly politicized&#13;
environment and in the face of parliamentary opposition. Capacity constraints,&#13;
particularly in the office of the Attorney General affected the processing of some&#13;
legislation. The civil service restructuring exercise was interrupted in 2001 following law&#13;
suits by private individuals against the restructuring program. Privatization in general was&#13;
delayed due to a number of factors including legal challenge and a shortage of finance for&#13;
essential pre-privatization downsizing. In the case of Kenya Telkom, the process of&#13;
selling 49% of Telkom shares to the winning consortium had reached an advanced stage&#13;
but the Government decided that the consortium could not provide the necessary&#13;
assurances on their technical experience and knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
16.      The new government's commitment to improving the economic governance&#13;
framework is strong and visible. In the ten months since coming to power, the&#13;
government has enacted, or is in the process of enacting, many major pieces of legislation&#13;
setting up and strengthening the institutional framework for governance, thereby going&#13;
much beyond the conditionality of the Credit. Specifically, the government has:&#13;
&#13;
0   Enacted the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act which creates and empowers&#13;
    a Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate corruption and economic crimes.&#13;
    The Act was not a condition of the Credit but was an IMF prior action for negotiating&#13;
    a new program.&#13;
&#13;
   Enacted and implemented The Public Officer Ethics Act that requires all public&#13;
   officials including the executive, members of parliament and the judiciary to disclose&#13;
   their wealth regularly. The Act was not a condition of the Credit but was an IMF prior&#13;
   action for negotiating a new program. The Judicial Service Commission has also&#13;
   published a Judicial Service Code of Conduct under the provisions of this Act.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 0  Approved bills on public procurement, public audit, and government financial&#13;
    management. These bills have been published and are awaiting deliberation by&#13;
    Parliament. The bills on public audit and financial management go beyond the Credit&#13;
    conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
0   Initiated work on judicial reform focused on rooting out corruption in the judiciary&#13;
    and improving access tojustice and the speed and transparency of legaljudgments.&#13;
&#13;
 17.    Civil service rightsizing continues to be politically sensitive but the government is&#13;
nonetheless moving forward. As part of another IDA project, the Public Sector&#13;
Management Technical Assistance Project (PSMTAP), the government is carrying out an&#13;
exercise to identify functions in various ministries that can be abolished, contracted out,&#13;
commercialized or eliminated. In the LDP update, the government has committed to&#13;
prepare a detailed strategy for civil service rightsizing and pay reform. The technical&#13;
work required for this is going on but is taking longer than expected because of capacity&#13;
constraints.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The new government remains fully committed to private sector participation in&#13;
commercial activities of public enterprises and is in the process of formulating a strategy&#13;
and laying down the framework for privatization. As a first step, the government is&#13;
preparing a privatization bill to provide legal and institutional basis for privatization&#13;
transactions. This bill was not a condition of the Credit. The draft bill has been approved&#13;
by Cabinet and the final bill is expected to be published in November. On large&#13;
infrastructural utilities - railways, ports and urban water - the stance and modalities for&#13;
private sector participation remain largely the same as before and the government has&#13;
committed in the updated LDP to take this preparatory work to its logical conclusion&#13;
within a stated time frame in each case. The government is also finalizing a privatization&#13;
strategy for other public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
19.     In the telecommunications sector, in line with the Bank's current technical&#13;
advice, the Government is taking steps to bring more competition to the market. As part&#13;
of its commitments in the LDP update, the government has approved a license for a&#13;
third mobile operator who has been authorized to start operating in December 2003. The&#13;
government has also decided not to renew Telkom's monopoly on international services&#13;
when it expires in 2004. The government is also in the process of finalizing a new&#13;
strategy on the privatization of Telkom.&#13;
&#13;
20.    The government has been working on reforming the budgeting and expenditure&#13;
management process. In FYOO, a three-year MTEF was adopted with a view to&#13;
strengthening linkages between budget and policy priorities, improving resource&#13;
predictability for sector ministries, and restructuring public expenditure in line with the&#13;
PRSP priorities. IDA is supporting the implementation of the MTEF through the&#13;
PSMTAP. Progress in implementing and institutionalizing MTEF has been slow so far.&#13;
Part of the problem has been frequent adjustments to the fiscal framework in view of&#13;
dwindling government resources. A MTEF review is being carried out, the findings of&#13;
which will be implemented during the 2004/05 annual budget cycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21.     A government owned process of annual Public Expenditure Review is becoming&#13;
institutionalized. Following a PER carried out in the budget year 2002/03, the&#13;
government has decided to carry out another PER exercise in the year 2003/04 to&#13;
underpin the 2004/05 budget. The focus of the new PER exercise is to carefully cost, and&#13;
project additional resources required by ministries to implement the ERS and arrive at a&#13;
medium-term strategy to align expenditures with the ERS priorities. The PER Technical&#13;
Working Group which monitors the PER process, and in which IDA participates along&#13;
with other donors, has been functioning effectively since the beginning of 2003. These&#13;
developments underlie a greater willingness on the part of government to infuse&#13;
transparency into budgetary processes and to work with both external and domestic&#13;
stakeholders on budget priorities.&#13;
&#13;
22.     A consolidated action plan for public expenditure management reform bringing&#13;
together the recommendations of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment 2001&#13;
and the recently concluded Public Expenditure Management Assessment and Action Plan&#13;
is being implemented. This action plan sets up the agenda for reform in the areas of&#13;
public accountability and financial management in the medium-term. Implementation of&#13;
the Integrated Financial Management Information System has now commenced after&#13;
previous delays and the system is planned to be hlly rolled out to line ministries by mid&#13;
2004 and to districts by end 2004.&#13;
&#13;
23.     While budgeted expenditure on core poverty program went up, the government&#13;
has not been able tofully protect the releases and expenditure, as detailed in paragraphs&#13;
36 to 37 below. The Ministry of Planning and National Development has taken steps in&#13;
the current budget year to strengthen the measures for monitoring and protecting releases&#13;
to core poverty programs.&#13;
&#13;
24.     In summary, the new government is committed to the reform program supported&#13;
by the Credit and the progress of reform has been satisfactory except for the two areas of&#13;
civil service rightsizing and the monitoring of core poverty programs. However, in other&#13;
areas, the governmenthas taken actions which go beyond those required by the Credit.&#13;
            v.       STATUS OF 12 SPECIFIC SECOND TRANCHE RELEASE ACTIONS&#13;
&#13;
            1. The Borrower has, consistent with paragraph 14 of the Letter of&#13;
                Development Policy (LDP), taken measures, including, if necessary,&#13;
                the presentation of legislation to Parliament, to merge the office of&#13;
                the Auditor General (Corporations)with the office of the Controller&#13;
                and Auditor General (C&amp;AG).&#13;
&#13;
25.     This condition has been met. Government introduced the merger bill as part of&#13;
the Miscellaneous Statute Amendment Bill in Parliament in April 2002. The Bill was&#13;
passed by Parliament on May 8, 2002 and signed by the President and the two offices&#13;
have subsequentlymerged.&#13;
&#13;
           2. The Borrower has established a Task force under terms of reference&#13;
                satisfactoryto the Association to review and prepare revisions to the&#13;
                Exchequer and Audit Act and other financial regulations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                  procedures with the view to improving the timely flow of budget&#13;
                  resourcesto the districtsas outlined in paragraph17 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
 26.     This condition has been met. A task force, chaired by the Deputy Accountant&#13;
 General, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA was established by the government&#13;
 in late 2000 and subsequently issued recommendations. Immediately prior to and&#13;
 following the establishment of the Task Force the government has taken the following&#13;
 measures to improve the flow of funds to the districts: (1) channeling payments for re-&#13;
 imbursement through Central Bank transfers between accounts, rather than writing&#13;
 checks and transmitting them by post; (2) issued Treasury Circular No.3 of March 2000,&#13;
which shortened the process of accessing funds from off-shore bank accounts; (3)&#13;
 instructed ministries to submit exchequer requisition for funding immediately after an&#13;
Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) has been issued; and (4) issued circular letter No&#13;
 7/2001 of 25 April, 2001 which re-organizes the operations of District Treasuries and&#13;
provides for separate bank accounts to be opened by every vote represented in the&#13;
districts, and for the direct channeling of funds to these accounts.&#13;
&#13;
27.     A key part of the task force's work concerned two new pieces of legislation to&#13;
replace the Exchequer and Audit Act, and to separate financial management functions&#13;
from audit functions. Drafts of the Financial Management Bill and the Audit Bill&#13;
(prepared in consultation with the Controller and Auditor General) were circulated to a&#13;
wide range of stakeholders, including Accounting Officers, for their review and&#13;
comments. Versions of the Bills acceptable to the IDA were approved by the Cabinet on&#13;
May 16, 2003 and published on June 6, 2003. They are now awaiting deliberation by&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
             3. The Borrower has, in accordance with paragraph 14 of the LDP,&#13;
                 submitted to the Association a progress report satisfactory to the&#13;
                 Association on the implementation of the Borrower's plan to (a)&#13;
                 enhance fiduciary transparency involving public resources, and @)&#13;
                 improvethe quality and timelinessof audit reports.&#13;
&#13;
28.     This condition has been met. With respect to (a) there were two developments.&#13;
First, district treasuries have been re-organized. The Treasury issued circular No 7/2001&#13;
(April 25, 2001) to provide for direct accountability by operating separate bank accounts&#13;
for each vote at the District Treasury to assure both Accounting Officers and District&#13;
Department Heads (Appropriations-in-Aid holders) that funds allocated to them from the&#13;
Exchequer are utilized. Second, to improve fiduciary transparency (as described in&#13;
paragraph 14 of the LDP) the government is introducing             an Integrated Financial&#13;
Management Information System. A copy of the Accountant General's progress report on&#13;
the development of the Integrated Financial Management Information System for the&#13;
quarter ending March 2003 has been received and the status was reviewed during the&#13;
PSMTAP supervision mission soon after. After delays in 2001/2002 the implementation&#13;
phase has commenced: key infrastructure such as cabling has been installed; the&#13;
implementation team has been trained; and orders have been placed for two production&#13;
servers. There are reasonable prospects that the Integrated Financial Management&#13;
Information System will be fully operational by the end of 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29.     With respect to (b), while regular progress reports were not produced by the&#13;
government, the condition has been met through the following actions. The C&amp;AG's&#13;
 audit reports for 1997/98, 1998/9 1999/00 and 2000/01 have been completed and&#13;
 submitted to parliament. The 2001/02 report is expected to be completed by November&#13;
2003. After the completion of the 2001/02 report, the backlog will have been cleared and&#13;
further reports will be on time. To facilitate the production of quarterly audit reports by&#13;
the C&amp;AG, the GOK has taken steps to (i) move ledger production from the Computer&#13;
 Services' mainframe computer to the Accountant General's Department; and (ii)&#13;
introduce computers to line ministries and district offices to facilitate quick and reliable&#13;
capture of data.&#13;
&#13;
           4. The Borrower has, as specified in paragraph 17 of the LDP,&#13;
                submitted to the Association progress reports satisfactory to the&#13;
                Association on the implementationof the government'sMarch 2000&#13;
                Circular regarding the processing of payments of donor-funded&#13;
                projectsutilizingoff-shorespecial accounts.&#13;
&#13;
30.     This condition has been met. Statistical tables sent to IDA on a regular basis&#13;
show an improvement in the flow of funds to donor-funded projects. Issues in the past&#13;
have concerned the prompt replenishment of the Special Accounts because of delays in&#13;
submitting Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Since 2001, the Accountant General's&#13;
department has been working closely with External Resources Department of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance to ensure smooth and faster flow of funds to projects. Regular&#13;
reports on progress show that the transfer of funds fkom the exchequer to projects has&#13;
improved discernibly. Funds have been transferred directly to project bank accounts and&#13;
they have been made available to project managers in good time, resulting in&#13;
contractodsuppliers getting paid promptly. The Government is regularly monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the March 2000 Circular with a view to ensure that identified&#13;
constraints are promptly addressed. The last report on flow of funds for IDA projects -&#13;
covering the lStquarter of 2003/04 - was submitted to IDA in November 2003&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           5. The Borrower's Cabinet has, as specified in paragraph 15 of the&#13;
               LDP, approved the new proposed procurement law whose objective&#13;
&#13;
               system for all public procurement (includingpublic enterprises);(ii)&#13;
               shall be to (a) establish a uniform and transparent procurement&#13;
&#13;
               establish a Procurement Appeals Board; and (iii) establish a&#13;
               Directorateof Public Procurement.&#13;
&#13;
31.    This condition has been met. The Finance Minister signed new Procurement&#13;
Regulations (2000) on March 16, 2001. The Attorney General gazetted the Regulations&#13;
on March 30,2001 (see Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 24, Legal notice No. 51) to apply&#13;
to public procurement (except those exempted, for example, on security grounds) by&#13;
public entities. A Treasury circular has been distributed to all public institutions to&#13;
enforce the Regulations. The Regulations entrust The Tender Board of each procuring&#13;
entity (under the chairmanship of its Accounting Officer) with the authority to award&#13;
contracts. The Regulations established a Procurement Appeals Board and a Directorate&#13;
of Public Procurement (DPP) to monitor the implementation of the new procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regulations. The press is briefed regularly on the outcome of appeal cases (and they are&#13;
posted on the Treasury website). The Directorate of Public Procurement has been staffed.&#13;
 The Inspection Unit has been active in monitoring and evaluating public entities on how&#13;
they are implementing public procurement regulations and providing necessary advice.&#13;
&#13;
32.      A Procurement Bill acceptable to IDA was approved by the Cabinet on May 16,&#13;
2003. This followed a rather protracted process. An earlier Procurement Bill was&#13;
 approved by the Cabinet, and published, at the same time that it approved the new&#13;
Procurement Regulations in March 2001. Subsequently, the Bill was withdrawn when it&#13;
was realized that key issues had not been well addressed. After consultations with&#13;
stakeholders (including national accountancy organizations), a revised bill was drafted.&#13;
The Bill was again submitted to Cabinet on July 25, 2002 and approved. This version of&#13;
the Bill was, however, never debated in parliament. Instead following the election at the&#13;
end of 2002, the new government drafted a revised Public Procurement and Disposal of&#13;
Assets Bill, 2003. This Bill, which is acceptable to IDA, was approved by the Cabinet on&#13;
May 16, 2003 and published on 24 June. The Bill is now awaiting deliberation by&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
            6. The Borrower has submitted to the Association reports, satisfactory&#13;
                 to the Association, showingprogress in implementingits civil service&#13;
                 restructuringplan specifiedin paragraph 23 of the LDP, including a&#13;
                 reduction of staff corresponding to the reduction in the core&#13;
                 functions of the government and including the removal of&#13;
                 duplicationof functions.&#13;
&#13;
33.     This condition has not been fully met and a waiver is recommended. This&#13;
condition required retrenching 32,000 personnel from civil service over a period of 2&#13;
years. In practice 23,448 civil servants were retrenched in 2000/01 before the program&#13;
was interrupted following law suits by private individuals against the civil service&#13;
restructuring program, together with parliamentary opposition. The previous government&#13;
was reluctant to move ahead because of the political sensitivity of the issue. It did&#13;
attempt, however to meet the objective of achieving comparable fiscal savings by&#13;
retrenchment in publicly funded organizations. A total of 5,613 staff have subsequently&#13;
been retrenched from the publicly funded organizations. In total, therefore, 29,061 civil&#13;
servants and staff in publicly funded organizations were retrenched over a three year&#13;
period, against a target of 32,000 civil servants in two years. The government's progress&#13;
reports outline the way in which the implementation of retrenchment in publicly h d e d&#13;
organizations has been made consistent with the civil service retrenchment program. An&#13;
estimate of wage savings has been provided in both cases&#13;
&#13;
34.     As mentioned above in paragraph 17, the new government is taking steps to&#13;
address again the issue of civil service rightsizing through ministerial rationalization and&#13;
net attrition, although in doing so it faces financing constraints. A specific commitment&#13;
in the updated LDP is to reduce the size of the civil service by 5,000 per year through&#13;
natural attrition. In the updated LDP, the government also focuses on reducing the&#13;
burden of the public service wage bill by setting firm targets for reducing the wage bill&#13;
share of GDP over time. A waiver is recommended as substantial retrenchment was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 achieved, the shortfall on target was relatively small taking into account additional&#13;
retrenchment in publicly funded organizations, and the new government is committed to&#13;
move forward with the rightsizing process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            7. The Attorney General of the Borrower has, as provided in&#13;
                paragraph 21 of the LDP, issued a legal opinion that the updated&#13;
                "Privatization Strategy Paper" as it relates to the public utilities&#13;
                sectors (railways, ports, electricity and water) is consistent with the&#13;
                current law and that no further new legislation is required to&#13;
                implement the privatization of these entities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34.      This condition has been met. The Attorney General issued a legal opinion on&#13;
June 13th2000 stating that GOK's privatization strategy submitted to IDA was consistent&#13;
with current law and that no specific privatization law was required to give legal effect to&#13;
the proposed strategies. Subsequently, the           government started preparation of a&#13;
Privatization Bill with the objectives of legally establishing both the privatization process&#13;
and institutional arrangements to enhance transparency in privatization transactions. The&#13;
Cabinet has approved a draft Privatization Bill and the final bill is expected to be&#13;
published in November. The government has also prepared a strategy for deciding on&#13;
privatization of public enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
           8. The Borrower has submitted to the Association a report showing the&#13;
               previous quarter's public expenditures in accordance with&#13;
               paragraph 25 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
35.    This condition has been met. Quarterly budget review reports, assessing&#13;
expenditure performance in the four quarters of both 2000/01 and 2001/02 have been&#13;
made available to the Association. Reports covering the first 2 quarters of 2002/03 have&#13;
also been made available, as have the third and fourth quarter reports in draft.&#13;
&#13;
           9. The Borrower has, in accordance with paragraph 25 of the LDP,&#13;
               submitted to the Association reports satisfactory to the Association&#13;
               on the financing and expenditures on core poverty programs. Such&#13;
               reports shall demonstrate the release of funds to the said programs&#13;
               and that funds released are in accordance with the 2000/2001&#13;
               budget. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "core poverty&#13;
               programs" shall be those which are particularly important to the&#13;
               poor and the disadvantaged members of the society.&#13;
&#13;
36.    This condition has not been fully met and a waiver is recommended. The&#13;
condition requires the government to define and finance a core poverty expenditure&#13;
program within the terms of the Credit each year. The government has identified core&#13;
poverty programs and quarterly reports have been submitted regularly. These reports&#13;
indicate that funds allocated to core poverty programs have increased over time in both&#13;
the recurrent and development budgets, in part because the definition of core poverty&#13;
program has been expanded. Thus budget allocation for core poverty recurrent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 expenditure (excluding expenditure on wages and interest payments) went up from 7% of&#13;
the total in 2000/01 to 17% in 2002/03; similarly the allocation for core poverty&#13;
 development expenditure grew from 14% to 25% of the total estimates during the same&#13;
period.&#13;
 37.     However, the government has not been able to ensure that funds allocated in the&#13;
budget for core poverty programs are released to spendingunits infull and actually spent.&#13;
 In 2000/01, actual expenditure on core poverty programs was 89% of the budget&#13;
 estimates and that on development was 58% of the estimates. In 2001/02 actual&#13;
 expenditure was 92% for recurrent estimates and 73% for development estimates. The&#13;
three main reasons for the gap between budgeted amounts and actual expenditure are (i)&#13;
the fiscal stress experienced due to low level of external development assistance during&#13;
this period; (ii) weaknesses in reporting and monitoring systems. The government has&#13;
cited recurring problems of obtaining accurate information on donor funding, especially&#13;
when payments are made directly; and (iii) weak commitment to the core poverty&#13;
programs in line ministries. In some instances, ministries have reallocated resources out&#13;
of core poverty programs into other areas.&#13;
37.     As stated in the updated LDP, the Government has taken steps to ensure that core&#13;
poverty programs are fully financed in accordance with their budget allocations during&#13;
the budget year 2003/04. It has redefined the set of core poverty programs in conjunction&#13;
with development partners and finalized mechanisms for fully protecting and monitoring&#13;
spending on such programs in consultation with line ministries. It is expected that these&#13;
mechanisms will be able to ensure full financing for the core poverty programs. The&#13;
Public Expenditure Review being conducted by the government in this budget year will&#13;
report on the financing of core poverty programs as well as physical progress associated&#13;
with these programs.&#13;
&#13;
38.     In summary, while overall allocation and expenditure on core poverty programs&#13;
has increased over the past three years, the goal of ensuring releases and expenditures in&#13;
accordance with the budget has not been fully met. The goal of fully protecting core&#13;
poverty expenditure has been technically difficult in a way that was not fully appreciated&#13;
at the time of designing the Credit. The new government has taken steps to strengthen&#13;
mechanisms which are expected to fully protect spending on core poverty programs. A&#13;
waiver is recommended.&#13;
&#13;
           10.   The Borrower has submitted to the Association a report showing&#13;
                 that National Aids Control Council (NACC) has been funded and&#13;
                 is operational,as providedin paragraph34 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
41.     This condition has been met. The government has provided project reports&#13;
which demonstrate there is adequate funding for NACC so far, except in areas where&#13;
there is limited capacity to implement the program. IDA is in agreement with the&#13;
absorptive capacity problems. A satisfactory budget and financing plan was agreed for&#13;
2001/02. In the current budget year 2003/04 Ksh. 18million allocated to NACC has been&#13;
released.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            11.   The Borrower has taken all measures necessary, including the&#13;
                  enactment of new legislation or amendment of existing legislation,&#13;
                  (a) to liberalize small farmer tea processing activities, (b)&#13;
                  abolishingthe Kenya Tea Development Authority(KTDA), and (c)&#13;
                  to implement policy measures to allow individual tea factories to&#13;
                  operate independently,all in accordance with paragraph 27 of the&#13;
                  LDP.&#13;
&#13;
42.     This condition has been met. Liberalization of the tea sector was implemented&#13;
by transforming KTDA into an independent agency through a legal notice in June, 2000&#13;
effective from July lSt2000. The new institution - Kenya Tea Development Agency Ltd. -&#13;
was incorporated under the Companies Act as a private entity owned by small-scale tea&#13;
farmers, through their respective tea factories. This ended the govemment control over&#13;
small farmer tea processing activities and individual tea factories. Kenya Tea&#13;
Development Agency now manages all the 45 small-scale tea factories.&#13;
&#13;
            12.   The Judicial Service Commission has approved the Judicial Code&#13;
                  of Conduct, as specifiedin paragraph18 of the LDP.&#13;
&#13;
43.     This condition has been met. The preparation, approval and enforcement of a&#13;
Judicial Code of Ethics has been linked to wider legislation on public officer ethics.&#13;
Parliament rejected an original Code of Conduct and Ethics bill in December 2000 and&#13;
the new government presented a revised `Public Officer Ethics' bill to parliament as soon&#13;
as it took power. Parliament has approved this Bill which following presidential assent&#13;
came into law on May 2, 2003. The Judicial Code of Conduct has been approved by the&#13;
Judicial Service Commission and gazetted on May 16,2003.&#13;
&#13;
                                     VI.     CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
44.     Ten out of twelve conditions for the second tranche release have been met to the&#13;
satisfaction of IDA and the broad objectives of the remaining two have been substantially&#13;
achieved. The progress on the reform program outlined in the government's Letter of&#13;
Development Policy dated June 2, 2000 has been satisfactory. In several areas (the Anti-&#13;
corruption Act, Public Office Ethics Act and the Privatization Bill) the government action&#13;
has gone beyond the requirements of the Credit. The new government has signaled its&#13;
ability and willingness to continue with and further deepen reform.&#13;

                                 Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement between the International&#13;

            Kenya - Economic and Public Sector Reform
            Credit Project : release of second tranche and waiver of two
            conditions and amendment of Development Credit Agreement
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Economic and Public Sector Reform
            Credit Project was prepared to assist the government
            jumpstart the implementation of Kenya's Interim Poverty
            Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), and, to improve the
            outlook for economic growth, and poverty reduction in the
            medium term, initially by containing the fragile
            macroeconomic situation, and fiscal difficulties. Although
            macroeconomic stability masks significant structural
            weaknesses in the economy, and, from a policy viewpoint, the
            structure of public spending seemingly favors a recurrent
            wage-bill expenditure, leaving little for investment in
            physical, human capital, and services delivery, commitments
            nonetheless, to improving the economic governance framework
            are strong, much beyond the conditionality of the Credit.
            Ten conditions regarding institutional auditing reforms,
            financial regulations to improve the budget process, the
            transparency of public spending, donor finance payments, the
            procurement process, the legal framework on privatization of
            public utilities, and, some legal and judicial reforms have
            been met. However, two conditions, civil service
            restructuring, and financing of core poverty programs, have
            not been fully met, but for which a waiver is recommended
            based on the fact that substantial retrenchment was
            achieved, and that, while core poverty expenditures have
            been technically difficult (in a way not fully appreciated
            at the time of project design), steps have been taken to
            strengthen mechanisms to fully protect spending on these programs.
