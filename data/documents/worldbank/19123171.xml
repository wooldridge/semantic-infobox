&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success&#13;
factorsâ&#128;&#153; selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systemsâ&#128;&#148;in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

Strategic Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The water and sanitation sector in Tanzania has undergone       pathwayâ&#128;&#153;, along which finance is converted into services,&#13;
extensive reforms in the past decade. This led to the           is functioning effectively. Upstream progress in policy and&#13;
recent adoption of a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp),               institutional reforms as well as finance is positive, but is&#13;
which includes much greater coordination of finance for         currently undermined by downstream management and&#13;
the sector as well as taking a sectorwide view of               implementation challenges. Key concerns include:&#13;
performance monitoring and institutional development.&#13;
Through the multidonor Water Sector Development                 â&#128;¢	 At the national level, improvements in procurement and&#13;
Program (WSDP), funding for the sector has quadrupled              budget management, monitoring, and reporting are&#13;
since 2002.                                                        critical to prevent a return to project funding.&#13;
                                                                â&#128;¢	 At the local level, sustainability and equity challenges&#13;
However, Tanzania is not on track to meet the Millennium           threaten to undermine the effectiveness of the new&#13;
Development Goal target for either water supply or                 funds in rural areas, as does the lack of a clear strategy&#13;
sanitationâ&#128;&#148;the overall trend in access as reported by survey       for pro-poor urban water supply.&#13;
data barely keeps up with population growth in both cases,      â&#128;¢	 Low budget utilization suggests that even if investment&#13;
let alone extending access to the unserved. Although the           funding for water supply were increased to the required&#13;
most up-to-date survey data was collected before the               level, the targets would not be met.&#13;
recent rapid increase in funding for the sector, the funding    â&#128;¢	 In sanitation, institutional and policy frameworks lag&#13;
has come too late to meet the targets. An analysis of the          behind those of the water supply sector, though progress&#13;
investment requirements and budget allocations suggests            is being made in addressing this.&#13;
that even with the recent increase, funding is less than        â&#128;¢	 The sanitation sector is also undermined by the lack of&#13;
what is required to meet urban water supply targets and            accurate data on the current state of latrine coverage.&#13;
only sufficient in rural areas if low cost technology options   â&#128;¢	 The lack of proven effective strategies to persuade and&#13;
are deployed. In sanitation, the mechanisms for leveraging         enable rural and urban households to invest in improved&#13;
the majority of finance which is expected to come from             sanitation in the Tanzanian context is also holding back&#13;
households are yet to be defined, making it difficult to           the sector. The outcome of ongoing efforts to fill this&#13;
estimate the investment gap.                                       knowledge gap will be very important.&#13;
&#13;
The shift to a SWAp has not been a smooth transition, and       This second AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2) has&#13;
a number of still-unresolved issues threaten to undermine       been produced in collaboration with the Government of&#13;
donor confidence before the new approach has been given         Tanzania and other stakeholders. Agreed priority actions&#13;
time to deliver. Institutional reform and increased finance     to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
do not guarantee services unless the entire â&#128;&#152;service-delivery   turned into services, have been identified here.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Finalize and operationalize the promising draft National Sanitation and Hygiene Policy, and efforts to improve inter-&#13;
     ministerial coordination as a matter of urgency.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Cement recent efforts to systematize and speed up procurement and budget management processes.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Make a clearer distinction between routine monitoring and household surveys to help the sector identify key obstacles&#13;
     preventing supply side progress (outputs) translating into user side improvements (outcomes).&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Bring household surveys in line with international best practice on sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Fast-track implementation of the new national program, PRONASAR and its associated common fund.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   The establishment of institutional arrangements and mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of community-managed&#13;
       rural water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban water supply&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Clarify and strengthen pro-poor approaches for urban water supply, including a combination of strengthening&#13;
       accountability mechanisms, pro-poor service options such as kiosks, and even tariff increases for those already&#13;
       connected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Identify an effective approach for rural household sanitation promotion based on current initiatives being tested at&#13;
       scale and mainstream this into a nationwide program supported with adequate staffing and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Revisit policy of only using public funds for sewerage expansion in favor of a pro-poor approach that supports&#13;
       urban household sanitation promotion with public solutions to facilitate better management of septage from onsite&#13;
       sanitation.&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), which are&#13;
implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and the WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has&#13;
been produced in collaboration with the Government of Tanzania and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

from routine monitoring data (number of facilities built,                   For sanitation, the JMP suggests access to improved&#13;

Second, public sector budgets in Tanzania frequently do&#13;
not distinguish between investments in water supply and&#13;
investments in sanitation. This makes it hard to estimate                     achieved. If any of the annual OPEX has to be subsidized&#13;
anticipated public investments in sanitation. The analysis                    from the public purse, for example to utilities that do not&#13;
of sanitation sector investments presented in Figure 2                        achieve operational cost recovery, it reduces the amount&#13;
(to meet the MDG targets, based on JMP data) should                           available for capital investment.&#13;
therefore be interpreted with caution. In particular, while&#13;
the substantial user contribution to capital costs depicted                   These considerations are only part of the picture.&#13;
in Figure 2 follows the policy assumption, it will not be                     Bottlenecks can in fact occur throughout the service&#13;

There are a number of reasons why the above depiction of                      should turn into services at the estimated unit costs.&#13;
investments may be over-optimistic. A particular concern                      Where it is not, the above investment requirements may&#13;
is operation and maintenance requirements (O&amp;M) (see                          be gross underestimates. The rest of this report evaluates&#13;

Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s institutional framework for water supply has          rural water supply. It builds on the previous Water Policy&#13;
undergone considerable reform in recent years as part of         (of 1991), strengthening mechanisms for community and&#13;
the shift to a SWAp. As a result, Tanzania out-scores its        private sector participation in water supply, and reducing&#13;
peers on indicators related to the institutional frameworks      the role of central government in implementation and&#13;
for urban and rural water supply. However, reforms to            management of water projects. This was followed by&#13;
the institutional framework for sanitation and hygiene           the 2005 National Water Sector Development Strategy&#13;
have lagged behind and are only now taking place. These          (NWSDS), which sets out to strengthen the previously&#13;
findings are reflected in Figure 4. The basic outline of         weak institutional and legal frameworks to implement&#13;
reforms for water supply and sanitation respectively is          the NAWAPO.14 This was formally approved in 2008 and&#13;

having recently reduced a considerable bias in favor of                of allocated resources is a major issue for the sector in&#13;
urban investments.23 In urban water supply, there is no                Tanzania. In the financial year 2007/8, only 55 percent of&#13;
national formula-based allocation system to utilities for              allocated budgets were expended,27 with delays in donorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
either capital or operational subsidy. The ministry has a              disbursements, cumbersome procurement processes, and&#13;
set of criteria for allocating investment funds to utilities,          limited implementation capacity cited as the main reasons&#13;
though these criteria are not used systematically. A                   for these delays.28 The situation improved slightly in&#13;
formula system, linked to the Local Government Capital                 2008/9, partly as a result of a budget reduction and partly&#13;
Grant means allocations within the rural water supply                  due to improvements in procurement management.29&#13;
subsector are more systematic, which has brought about                 Nevertheless, utilization challenges remain serious, and&#13;
a major improvement in equity between districts,24 though              currently suggest that even if funding were to increase&#13;
deviations from the formula system remain common.25                    to the required level, the targets would not be met.&#13;
                                                                       The capacity constraints of coordinating authorities,&#13;

combination of need (as demonstrated by current levels of              present.&#13;

       Priority actions for rural water supply&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   The increased funding available for rural water supply should be allocated more efficiently, including&#13;
            through more systematic use of data. This applies both nationally, where the allocation formula should&#13;
            be applied in full, and at local level, where equity considerations should be given greater weight in&#13;
            planning.&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address the poor sustainability record of rural water&#13;
            projects, including through strengthening monitoring of functionality and exploring the possibility of&#13;
            creating a funding window for rehabilitation of rural water supply infrastructure.&#13;

Government routine monitoring data puts coverage at 59             The costing model, which assumes the higher coverage levels&#13;

underinvestment in rural water supply have resulted in             a third of available finance. Furthermore, regardless of the&#13;
no increase access. The massive increase in funding in the         coverage data used, it is likely that some of the required&#13;
past three years has the potential to improve this situation,      operational expenditure (OPEX) burden of around US$19&#13;
though significant bottlenecks are undermining progress            million per year will fall on public finance, in the absence of&#13;

As in the rural subsector, urban water supply is generally          pro-poor planning. Strategies in use in some utilities for&#13;
stronger upstream, though it registers lower scores for             expanding services to the poor in current use include&#13;
developing aspects than sustaining (see Figure 15). Overall,        the construction of public water supply kiosks and cross-&#13;
it performs above its peer group average, but apart from            subsidies to support first time connections. However, these&#13;
the apparent shortfall in investments there are several             strategies are not widely implementedâ&#128;&#148;a 2008 survey&#13;
issues which need to be addressed before finance will               found that only 5 percent of 185 recently constructed&#13;

finance is not the only obstacle to service expansion. Low          the poorest households.&#13;
utilization rates have been blamed primarily on procurement&#13;

progress is being made in addressing these problems by              viability is their operating ratio (operational income over&#13;

The equity with which finance is distributed also registers a       to cover their operating costs. Nonrevenue water is also&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Tanzania :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The first round of Country Status
            Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the
            preparedness of sectors of 16 countries in Africa to meet
            the Millenial Development Goals (MDGs) based on their
            medium-term spending plans and a set of &#145;success factors&#146;
            selected from regional experience. Combined with a process
            of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted
            countries to ask whether they had those &#145;success factors&#146; in
            place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.
            The African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW)
            commissioned the production of a second round of Country
            Status Overviews (CSO2s) to better understand what underpins
            progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member
            governments can do to accelerate that progress across
            countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The analysis aims to
            help countries assess their own service delivery pathways
            for turning finance into water supply and sanitation
            services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water
            supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2
            analysis has three main components: a review of past
            coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of future
            investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of
            particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.
            The CSO2&#146;s contribution is to answer not only whether past
            trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. A synthesis report,
            available separately, presents best practice and shared
            learning to help realize these priority actions.
