NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:    Lebanese Republic&#13;
Beneficiary:  Ministry of Public Works&#13;
Amount:      US$42 million&#13;
Terms:       Standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar-denominated single currency loans,&#13;
with 17 years' maturity, including 5 years of grace&#13;
Project      The project would assist in the implementation of a program of urgently needed road&#13;
Description:  rehabilitation works through financing a pilot program comprising components of the&#13;
Government's overall Road Rehabilitation Program (RRP), which is to rehabilitate about&#13;
3,500 km of the national road network.  The project would also assist in the&#13;
implementation of road sector reforms.  Specifically, the project is comprised of:&#13;
Component A (US$61.5 m): Pilot Road Rehabilitation Program to rehabilitate about 400&#13;
km of international, primary and secondary roads distributed among the four regions of&#13;
the country. Component B (US$4.8 m): Technical assistance to: (i) support a Program&#13;
Impiementation Unit; (ii) carry out a detailed Road User Charges Study; (iii) assist in the&#13;
implementation of the Statement of Road Sector Policy; and (iv) strengthen the&#13;
Directorate of Roads in the implementation of the Road Rehabilitation Program.&#13;
Component C (US$1.5 m): Equipment, including laboratory equipment, traffic counting&#13;
and axle load control equipment.&#13;
Benefits:    Detailed evaluation of the national road network, and selection of road sections to be&#13;
rehabilitated, has been carried out utilizing the World Bank's Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Standards Model (HDM-III). The results of these studies indicate that the&#13;
rehabilitation works proposed to be implemented under the RRP have very high economic&#13;
rates of return. The Modified IRR estimated for the program shows an overall rate of&#13;
return of 30 percent.  Additional benefits include: establishment of self-financing&#13;
mechanisms for the road sector through the introduction of user charges, employment&#13;
generation among poorer segments of society through geographically dispersed road&#13;
works, and enhancement of road safety.&#13;
Risks:       Implementation risks for the proposed project, as well as for the overall Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program, relate to: (a) the present weaknesses in the implementation&#13;
capacity of Directorate of Roads (DOR); and (b) the need to secure significant financial&#13;
resources for the rehabilitation program. With regard to the former, the project design&#13;
seeks to mitigate the institutional capacity risk through creation of a Program&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) within the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) with adequate&#13;
powers in the areas of planning, resource allocation, procurement and monitoring of&#13;
works implementation. In relation to the financing risk, the major uncertainty is a delay&#13;
in implementation of the road user charges which could jeopardize financing of the RRP.&#13;
These financing risks are mitigated by the Government's commitment to full cost&#13;
recovery in the road sector as set out in the Statement of Road Sector Policy.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The prolonged 17-year conflict in Lebanon and the consequent neglect of the road network has&#13;
resulted in a considerable backlog of maintenance, and about 35 percent of the overall network is now&#13;
in poor condition. Failure to address this problem in a timely manner will lead to large economic losses&#13;
both due to high vehicle operating costs as well as due to losses of the physical infrastructure which&#13;
would then require expertsive reconstruction. It is estimated that reducing "poor condition" roads to about&#13;
10 percent of the network, which is about the average for well-managed road networks, would produce&#13;
savings for the Lebanese economy of about US$100.0 million/year on account of vehicle operating cost&#13;
savings alone. Preservation of the network would generate additional savings by avoiding costly&#13;
reconstruction in the future. Urgent action is needed to restore the network and preserve existing road&#13;
assets. The Government of Lebanon (GOL) is therefore initiating a major Road Rehabilitation Program&#13;
(RRP) to rehabilitate about 3,500 km of roads. The proposed National Roads Project (NRP), which is&#13;
to support this overall program by financing institutional strengthening and a pilot program of road&#13;
rehabilitation works, is consequently a high priority for the Government in the transport sector.&#13;
II. THE ROAD SECTOR&#13;
2.1    Roads are critical to the efficient functioning of the Lebanese economy, being the only mode of&#13;
internal transport, and the main transportation link with the regional hinterland which is, and will&#13;
continue to be, a major factor in the country's development. Furthermore, expenditures on roads is one&#13;
of the single largest components of the Government's budget (second only to civil service salaries), and&#13;
hence efficiency in the road sector also has significant fiscal implications for the country. This section&#13;
gives an overview of the road sector and highlights some of the key issues. A more detailed discussion&#13;
of the sector is provided in the project files (Project Working Papers).&#13;
A. The Road Network&#13;
2.2    Lebanon's road network is extensive and well distributed throughout the country (0.63 km/sq.&#13;
km).  Excluding municipal roads, it comprises about 6,330 km subdivided into four categories:&#13;
international roads (530 km), primary roads (1,650 kin), secondary roads (1,340 km), and local roads&#13;
(2,810 km). More than 80 percent of this network, including all primary roads, consists of two-lane&#13;
bituminous roads which are usually narrow and winding with structures varying in width, load capacity&#13;
and condition. A detailed inventory made during 1995 of the first three categories revealed that 36&#13;
percent of the national network (excluding local roads) is in poor condition, as shown in Table 1 below.&#13;

Source: Maintenance &amp; RehaBilitation of Lebanon's Road Network, CDR, 19!3 -.&#13;
Note: a/About 450 km of international, primary and secondary roads were not surveyed, as these were located in&#13;
the buffer zone in South Lebanon.&#13;
2.3    Traffic densities are high on some portions of the network, particularly around Beirut where&#13;
traffic volumes in excess of 150,000 vehicles/day are recorded on the coastal highway to the north of the&#13;
city. High traffic densities are also found along the coastal highway to the south, and on the highway&#13;
from Beirut to the Bekaa valley. The motor vehicle fleet has been increasing rapidly; even during the&#13;
war years the fleet grew from about 265,000 vehicles in 1974 to 670,000 vehicles in 1986. Recent&#13;
estimates indicate a fleet of about I million vehicles, which for a population of about 4 million indicates&#13;
a high vehicle ownership ratio (1 vehicle/4 persons). Rapid expansion of the automobile fleet is partly&#13;
attributable to the virtual collapse of public transport systems in the country as a consequence of the civil&#13;
war. The Bank is assisting the Government, under a Japan - PHRD Grant funded technical assistance,&#13;
in formulating a program to address public transport issues and facilitate private investment in the&#13;
delivery of urban transport services.&#13;
2.4   In addition to the high traffic volumes, parts of the Lebanese road network are also subjected to&#13;
high tr;ffic loads due to the heavy vehicle traffic generated by the reconstruction works now underway.&#13;
The results of axle load surveys indicate a significant axle load problem, primarily caused by the transport&#13;
of construction materials and the lack of enforcement of axle load controls. Trucks causing the greatest&#13;
damage are the 2-axic heavy trucks and the 3-axle rigid trucks, which are the most popular truck types&#13;
in the fleet. For 2-axle heavy trucks, 35 percent of the trucks registered single axle loads of 14 to 24&#13;
tons, while for 3-axle rigid trucks 50 percent registered axle loads of 14 to 22 tons. The legal limit on&#13;
a single axle is 14 tons, but the regulations now in place are complex and difficult to enforce. The&#13;
potential benefits of enforcement are, however, very significant.  It is estimated that improving&#13;
regulations and enforcement to international standards would result in a reduction in road pavement&#13;
damage on the order of between 27 and 44 percent. The proposed project, therefore, proviees for the&#13;
installation of weigh-bridges at selected locations to allow implementation of an enhanced system of axle&#13;
load controls.&#13;
B. Institutional Framework&#13;
2.5    The Directorate of Roads (DOR) within the Directorate General of Highways and Buildings&#13;
(DGHB) of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) is responsible for road maintenance. The&#13;
organizational structure of DOR within the MPW is shown in Chart 1. Over the war years, institutional&#13;
capacity for administration of the road network was severely depleted. This loss of institutional capacity&#13;

is best illustrated by the reductions in skilled manpower that DOR has suffered: in late 1994, out of 10&#13;
established positions at the Grade II level, 9 were vacant, and at the Grade III level, out of 115 positions,&#13;
81 were vacant. Overall, DOR now has about 70 percent of its approximately 500 authorized positions&#13;
vacant. Any program for rehabilitation of the road network would therefore also have to address the need&#13;
to create adequate institutional structures and capabilities.  In addition to DOR, the Council for&#13;
Development and Reconstruction (CDR), and the Conseil Executif des Grands Projets (CEGP) also&#13;
undertake road works but they mainly undertake larger projects implemented through private contractors&#13;
and are not responsible for maintenance.&#13;
C. Pnb!ic Expenditures in the Road Sector&#13;
2.6   Funding for the road sector is provided under three government budgets: the MPW budget, the&#13;
CDR budget, and the CEGP budget. The latter two are for new construction and major works&#13;
implemented as large projects. Maintenance funding is provided through the MPW budget and is&#13;
implemented by DOR either through contracted works or, to a much lesser extent, through force account&#13;
operations using DOR's own labor, plant and equipment. Presently, MPW's road maintenance budget&#13;
is around US$60 million per year. About 90 percent of the budget is expended through contracted works,&#13;
and there exists a sizeable local road construction industry with 37 private contractors capable of&#13;
undertaking road works valued at up to US$10 million per contract.&#13;
2.7   In order to assess the adequacy of maintenance expenditures, a comparison was made with other&#13;
countries on the basis of average maintenance expenditures per kilometer of network.  Since the&#13;
comparator countries have higher standard road networks, it could be expected that their expenditure&#13;
levels (per kilometer) would be higher than in Lebanon. On the contrary, however, expenditures for the&#13;
Lebanese network are about twice those of the highest cost comparator - Finland. Maintenance of the&#13;
Finnish network is tspecially problematic due to climatic factors and the existence of a large lumber&#13;
industry which regnlarly moves large numbers of heavy vehicles over the network. The extremely high&#13;
cost of maintaining the Lebanese network may be explained by two factors, first, the poor condition of&#13;
the network, which requires excessive expenditures to provide a reasonable riding surface, and second,&#13;
inefficiencies duc to a lack of systematic planning and control of expenditures.&#13;
D. The Road Rehabilitation Program&#13;
2.8    Recognizing the urgency to carry out a systematic evaluation of rehabilitation needs for the road&#13;
network, the CDR engaged consultants in December 1994 to develop a comprehensive Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program using the Highways Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM) and its&#13;
supporting Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM), which have been developed by the World Bank. The&#13;
study was in twc phases. Phase I involved data collection and economic analysis to define the priority&#13;
program, and Phase II to prepare detailed designs for the first year program. Data was collected&#13;
describing the current roadway characteristics and traffic, the expected traffic growth, the vehicle fleet&#13;
characteristics and unit costs, the unit costs of road maintenance operations, and the characteristics of the&#13;
maintenance strategies to be evaluated. The analysis is discussed in greater detail in Section V - Economic&#13;
Evaluation. Based on this evaluation an overall road rehabilitation program was defined and a detailed&#13;
description is in the project files (Project Working Papers). The proposed Road Rehabilitation Program&#13;
is summarized in Table 2 below.&#13;

E. Road Sector PerCormance&#13;
2.9    Present problems in the road sector are evident from the following observations:&#13;
36 percent of the Lebanese road network is in poor condition, as compared with 12&#13;
percent on average for well managed networks and 22 percent on average for poorly&#13;
managed networks', and is resulting in economic losses of about US$140 million/year.&#13;
Annual expenditures for maintenance of the Lebanese network at about US$10,(00/km&#13;
is more than twice the level for stable, well maintained networks (US$2,000 to&#13;
US$5,000/km), but these high expenditures have not resulted in a significant&#13;
improvement in the overall network condition.&#13;
High axle loads cause excessive damage to roads, and large numbers of trucks are found&#13;
to have axle loads in the 18-22 ton range as compared with a normal design limit of 13&#13;
tons - doubling axle loads increases pavement damage by a factor of 16 (4th power).&#13;
Bad road conditions (lack of guard rails, signage, etc.) cause many accidents. For July,&#13;
1995 the figures were 88 fatalities, which is about 10-12 fatalities per 100 million&#13;
vehicle-km compared with European Union rates of 2.7 per 100 million vehicle-km.&#13;
To deal with the problems effectively, there is a need to strengthen institutional capacity in the road sector&#13;
and this will require both strengthening the existing institution, i.e. DOR, as well as augmenting the&#13;
institutional structure to create the accountability and separation of functions, implementation vs.&#13;
budgeting and programming, necessary to prevent the inefficiency now evident in the sector.&#13;
III. ROAD SECTOR REFORM&#13;
3.1    Effective implementation of a rehabilitation program on the scale envisaged under the RRP will&#13;
require strengthening of institutional capacity as well as mobilization of additional financial resources for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
the roads sector. Weaknesses in the DOR cause expenditures on roads to not achieve commensurate&#13;
results due to DOR's inability to resist various pressures to undertake works without adequate planning&#13;
and justification. The ability of DOR to re-establish its institutional capacity is constrained by limitations&#13;
in areas such as its ability to recruit trained personnel, to enter into contracts, and to mobilize necessary&#13;
financial resources. These considerations have led the Government to decide, as an integral part of the&#13;
RRP, on restructuring the institutional framework in the road sector. The reforms to be implemented are&#13;
set out in a Statement of Road Sector Policy (Annex 1) and are sumimarized below.&#13;
A. Statement of Road Sector Policy&#13;
3.2    Government recognizes the present institutional weaknesses in the sector, and also that they&#13;
represent an opportunity to rebuild the institutional framework based on improved concepts of effective&#13;
road sector administration and financing, and increased responsiveness to the needs of road users. At&#13;
negotiations. a detailed Statement of Road Sector Policy was agreed. and this statement has been&#13;
confirrned bv the Government as its policg for the sector. Key elements of this policy are:&#13;
(a)   to develop the national road network in ways that promote regionally and socially&#13;
balanced development of the country;&#13;
(b)   to preserve the existing road network, which is a major infrastructure asset critical to the&#13;
nation's economic well-being, in a cost-effective manner and to enhance its safety and&#13;
efficiency;&#13;
(c)   to reduce the reliance of the road sector on the Government's recurrent bud,et and&#13;
increase efficiency in road use over time by recovering from users the cost of providing&#13;
roads;&#13;
(d)   to create a strong institutional capacity in the road sector capable of deploying modern&#13;
planning, design and management technologies to achieve the objectives of this policy;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   to develop the capacity of the road sector to mobilize resources to finance the&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of the road network.&#13;
The full te~xt oi the Statement of Road Sector Policy, as approved by the Council of Ministers on May&#13;
9, i996, is in Annex 1.&#13;
B. Road User Charges&#13;
3.3    Success of the proposed reforms in the road sector, and in particular those elements related to&#13;
the financing of the sector, requires that the level of user charges established be adequate to provide the&#13;
financial resources needed for maintenance of the road network. An efficient structure of user charges&#13;
is also essential to providing the right incentives for efficiency in the use of road assets. Important&#13;
considerations in setting user charges would be to reduce the environmental impacts of excessive fuel use,&#13;
and to recover from heavy vehicles the higher costs they impose through increased pavement damage.&#13;
Surcharges on petrol/diesel, vehicle license fees and heavy vehicle fees would be the primary user charges&#13;
utilized. As it will be difficult to introduce major changes in user charges at one time, a phased program&#13;
of user charge increases is to be developed through a Road User Charges Study, with initial shortfalls&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
in cash flows being covered by borrowings against future revenues. Such a program of user charge&#13;
increases, would include appropriate corrections for inflation and productivity enhancements. It should&#13;
be noted here that fuel prices in Lebanon are still somewhat below prices in neighboring countries&#13;
(LebanoL US$0.35/ltr versus Syria US$0.41/ltr in December 1995). Since the level of road user charges&#13;
would be based on assessments of the cost of maintaining the existing network, any network expansion&#13;
or other extraordinary expenditures without compensating revenues (e.g., tolls on a new road) would&#13;
require either additional increases in user charges or a specific budget transfer. Satisfactory completion&#13;
of the Road User Charges study by September 30, 1997 is a covenant of the prorosed Loan.&#13;
C. Financing the Road Rehabilitation Program&#13;
3.4    Overall financing requirements for the RRP is estimated to be about US$500.0 million, which&#13;
would be provided by: the proposed loan for the NRP; GOL's road maintenance budget for an initial&#13;
period; and contributions from Road User Charges. Full cost recovery from road users for rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of the road network will be achieved over a period of three to five years between 1998&#13;
and 2003.  The following indicative levels of user charges have been estimated and would be&#13;
confirmed/refined in the user charges study to be undertaken during implementation of the project:&#13;
(a)    An initial surcharge on fuel of LL 16/ltr in 1998, eventually increasing to LL 48/ltr (in&#13;
constant 1995 prices); and&#13;
(b)   75 percent of existing Vehicle License Fees, which would be adjusted in 1998 based on&#13;
the detailed Road User Charges Study to be carried out by the Government.&#13;
Revenues from the above sources would be deposited in a Trust Account at the Banque du Liban called&#13;
the Road Fund. Most of these revenues would be used solely for rehabilitation, improvement and&#13;
maintenance os the classified network, with the remaining being transferred to the Ministry of&#13;
Municipalities as a contribution to their maintenance of internal roads. Projected Road Fund revenues&#13;
are shown in Table 3 below. Legislation needed to implement these road user charges and establish the&#13;
Road Fund will be submitted to Parliament no later than February 28, 1998 (Annex 1, Statement of Road&#13;
Sector Policy). MPW will conduct annual reviews of the road rehabilitation program to ensure that the&#13;
program is appropriately prioritized and that works included have an internal rate of return above 15&#13;
percent. Prior to creation of the Road Fund. GOL will ensure that the RRP is adeguatelv funded.&#13;

IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
4.1    The National Roads Project's objectives are to: (i) implement a pilot road rehabilitation program&#13;
in support of the RRP; (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for maintenance and development of the&#13;
national road network; and (iii) reduce reliance on the Government's budget by requiring users to pay&#13;
for the provision of roads.&#13;
4.2    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's strategy in Lebanon is primarily driven by the&#13;
country's extensive reconstruction needs which, after the long civil war and the consequent neglect of&#13;
infrastructure development, calls for efficient utilization of very limited public resources for rebuilding&#13;
the country's infrastructure. The proposed project is consistent with this overall country assistance&#13;
strategy, which was discussed by the Board on June 30, 1994, and which, inter alia, supports&#13;
rehabilitation of infrastructure and strengthening core functions of public administration. With a view&#13;
to minimizing budgetary impacts, the project seeks to assist the Government in rehabilitating its road&#13;
network with a significant portion of the needed financial resources being mobilized from road users,&#13;
rather than funded from the general budget. More importantly, the project creates the institutional&#13;
structures critical to future development of the road sector, and the Bank is in a unique position (given&#13;
its experience across countries) to assist the Government in this difficult area.&#13;
A. Project Description&#13;
4.3    The National Roads Project would help finance a three-year pilot program of urgently needed&#13;
road rehabilitation works and the necessary technical assistance in support of the Government's Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program. The main components of the proposed project are:&#13;
A.    Road Rehabilitation Works. A three-year pilot program to rehabilitate about 400 km of&#13;
selected international, primary and secondary roads distributed among the four Regional&#13;
Directorates of Roads.&#13;
B.    Technical Assistance to:&#13;
(i)    support the MPW's Program  Implementation Unit (PIU) in planning and&#13;
programming   works,  preparing   guidelines  for  and  reviewing&#13;
feasibility/environmental studies, undertaking all procurement actions necessary&#13;
for the project, and monitoring outputs;&#13;
(ii)   carry out a detailed road user charges study to recommend the level and structure&#13;
of tariffs;&#13;
(iii)   assist in the preparation of laws and regulations to implement the Statement of&#13;
Road Sector Policy; and&#13;
(iv)   strengthen the capacity of the Directorate of Roads to develop and implement the&#13;
Road Rehabilitation Program, including preparation of feasibility/environmental&#13;
studies and supervision of works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
C.      Equipment.  Procurement of vehicles, computers, office equipment, road laboratory&#13;
equipment, traffic counting equipment and axle-load control equipment for better&#13;
management of roads.&#13;
A more detailed description of the project is presented in Annex 2.&#13;
4.4     The road rehabilitation works will be carried out in accordance with design standards established&#13;
for the Road Rehabilitation Program (a detailed description of the program is in the Project Working&#13;
Papers). All the works will be carried out on existing alignments, except for minor improvements to&#13;
meet design standards and for traffic safety. Rehabilitation will consist mainly of pavement strengthening&#13;
and drainage improvements. Road intersections will be corrected and "blackspots" will be eliminated to&#13;
reduce road accidents, and on all project roads safety barriers, road signs, and road markings will be&#13;
provided. To increase the level of service of the road network, the carriageway of the classified roads&#13;
will be widened as rights of way permit, or when the required expropriation does not require&#13;
resettlement, to achieve the minimum objective of 7 meter wide carriageway and 1.5 meter wide&#13;
shoulders for international and primary roads, and 6 meter width and 1.5 meter shoulders for secondary&#13;
roads. It is expected that this pilot program will be implemented in three successive groups of projects&#13;
to be launched during the first three years of the RRP. Roads to be rehabilitated under the project in the&#13;
first year have been selected and their details are provided in Annex 2.&#13;
B. Project Cost Estimate&#13;
4.5     The estimated total project cost is US$67.8 million, including physical and price contingencies,&#13;
with a foreign component of US$38.6 million equivalent, or 57 percent of total project cost. Costs were&#13;
estimated at July 1995 prices and include physical contingencies of 15 percent for the road works&#13;
component. Costs have been estimated based on average costs per kilometer (based on bids for road&#13;
works of similar magnitude and nature) and for consultant services (based on average staff-month costs&#13;
for foreign and local consultants). For the calculation of price contingencies, it was assumed that the&#13;
foreign cost will increase by 2.6 percent per year. Given that the Lebanese economy is highly dollarized,&#13;
local costs were estimated in US dollars and price contingencies for local costs were estimated using the&#13;
same rate of 2.6 percent a year. The project cost estimate is provided in Table 4.&#13;

C. Financing Plan&#13;
4.6    The Bank will finance US$42 million, or 62 percent of project cost, and the Government will&#13;
finance US$25.8 million. The Bank loan would finance 60 percent of the civil works costs, 75 percent&#13;
of the technical assistance services, and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for equipment and supplies&#13;
procured under project Component C. The financing plan is presented in Table 5 below.&#13;
4.7    Loan Terms. The borrower has selected LIBOR-based variable rate US dollar single currency&#13;
loan termrs. These terms were considered to be the most appropriate for the Government's overall&#13;
liability management.&#13;

D. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.8    A Program Implementation Unit established within MPW will oversee the project. The PIU will&#13;
be responsible for coordinating implementation, monitoring progress (including preparation of progress&#13;
reports), and processing disbursement requests. All procurement under the project will be carried out&#13;
by the PIU. Performance of the project in meeting its objectives would be measured against indicators&#13;
which are set out in Annex 3. Key indicators related to specific project objectives are summarized below:&#13;
*     Objective (i): effectiveness of pilot rehabilitation program would be measured against&#13;
monitorable targets set for:&#13;
- timely implementation of pilot rehabilitation program;&#13;
- percentage of network in good condition; and&#13;
- percentage of vehicle - kilometers on poor condition roads.&#13;
*     Objective (ii): institutional strengthening would be monitored against production of&#13;
annual works program using an appropriate pavement management system; and&#13;
*     Objective (iii):  full cost recovery in the road sector would be monitored against&#13;
implementation of road user charges.&#13;
Agreement on the monitoring and reporting of the above key indicators was obtained at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Procurement&#13;
4.9    'ithe project components, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the elements&#13;
to be financed by the Bank are detailed in Annex 4 and are summarized in Table 6. The Bank-financed&#13;
civil work; and equipment would be procured under the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits. Consulting services financed under the loan would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the Bank as Executing Agency.&#13;
The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the Ministry of Public Works will be able to apply&#13;
procurement procedures satisfactory to the Bank, and to follow the Bank's Procurement Guidelines once&#13;
Parliament ratifies the Loan Agreement. which requires the use of Bank's Guidelines for all procurement.&#13;
4.10   All civil works contracts would be awarded using ICB procedures, and procurement&#13;
documentation and decisions relating to all civil works contracts would be subject to prior review and&#13;
approval by the Bank. Pre-qualification of contractors for all civil works contracts would be required.&#13;
Contracts for equipnment and materials, not exceeding US$200,000 each, would be procured through&#13;
international shopping procedures based on the comparison of three price quotations from at least two&#13;
countries. The total aggregate value of such contracts would not exceed US$1.0 million. All contracts&#13;
exceeding US$200,000 would be subject to prior review and approval by IBRD. For consultancy&#13;
assignments financed by IBRD 4.mder the project, there would be prior review for contracts worth&#13;
$100,000 and above for contracts with consulting firms and $50,000 and above for contracts with&#13;
individual consultants. This would result in prior review of about 90 percent of Bank-financed&#13;
procurement.  During negotiations. agreement was reached with the Government on the above&#13;
procurement arrangements and those set out in Table 6.&#13;

F. Disbursements and Audit&#13;
4.11   The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table 7.&#13;
Withdrawal applications for contracts valued at more than US$200,000 for goods and works, US$100,000&#13;
with con5ulting finms and US$50,000 for individual consultants, will be presented in English for&#13;
disbursements. Disbursements for contracts valued at less than US$200,000 for goods and works,&#13;
US$100,000 with consulting firms, and US$50,000 with individual consultants, will be made on the basis&#13;
of Stateinents of Expenditures (SOEs). During negotiations. it was agreed that documentation to support&#13;
exrenditures financed under SOEs or otherwise will be maintained in English by the MPW and made&#13;
avaiiable for review by Bank supervision missions. It was also agreed that annual audit reports of project&#13;
accounts and SOEs will be prepared and submitted in English by auditors acceptable to the Bank within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
4.12   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government will&#13;
open a Special Account in the Central Bank, to be operated by the MPW under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactorj to the Bank. The Bank would make an initial deposit of US$1.0 million in the Special&#13;
Account. Once total withdrawals from the loan have reached US$4.5 million, the authorized allocation&#13;
for the Special Account would be increased to US$2.0 million. The MPW will submit replenishment&#13;
applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or when half the authorized allocation has been&#13;
used, whichever comes first. The replenishment applications will be supported by the necessary&#13;
documentation: a bank statement of the Special Account and a reconciliation bank statement of the Special&#13;
Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow Bank&#13;
procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to the Bank for review and approval within six&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the above&#13;
orovisions for the operation and auditing of the SRecial Account.&#13;

4.13   Disbursement Schedule. A schedule of disbursements, based on a projected effectiveness date&#13;
in December 1996, is given in Annex 5. It is anticipated that the proposed project will be completed in&#13;
about 66 months and disbursements would essentially be completed by June 30, 2002. Including a 12-&#13;
month contractor's maintenance period, the closing date is set for June 30, 2003. Due to the relatively&#13;
uncomplicated nature of the works to be financed, the estimated disbursement schedule is shorter than&#13;
the standard disbursement profile for a transport sector project.&#13;
G. Project Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
4.14  It is estimated that over the project execution period 14 supervision missions would be needed,&#13;
with one large project inception mission initially, to launch the project. Total staffweeks for supervision&#13;
is estimated to be in the order of 100 staffweeks distributed among a project team (transport economist,&#13;
highway engineer, project finance specialist) and other specialists, such as an HDM Specialist, an&#13;
Institutional Development Specialist, a Procurement Specialist, etc. Project supervision would be based&#13;
on the agreed set of Project Monitoring and Development Indicators presented in Annex 3.&#13;
4.15   Mid-Term Review. A review of the project will be carried out within three years of the date&#13;
of effectiveness but no later than June 30, 2000. This review will be based on the various monitoring&#13;
indicators agreed for the project.&#13;
H. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.16   The project has been processed as an environmental Category B project since it involves only the&#13;
rehabilitation of existing roads with minor realignments, within existing rights of way, to improve safety.&#13;
For the road rehabilitation works, key issues addressed in the environmental analysis are the quarrying&#13;
of stone and location of borrow areas. The most important recommendation of the environmental analysis&#13;
is that an environmental unit be established within the DOR to monitor environmental impacts of the&#13;
proposed project, and other projects in the sector, and to develop guidelines for the implementation of&#13;
mitigatory measures. The environmental analysis and actions includes an Environmental Mitigation and&#13;
Monitoring Plan (Annex 6) for the various environmental impacts which are likely to arise during road&#13;
rehabilitation works.  During negotiations. agreement was reached on the establishment of the&#13;
environmental unit and on implementation of the mitigation plan.&#13;
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
5.1   This section presents the economic evaluation of the overall RRP and of the individual road works&#13;
components selected for the first-year pilot program to be financed under the proposed project. The&#13;
economic evaluation is based on studies carried out by consultants engaged by CDR to develop a cost&#13;
effective rehabilitation program. The studies utilized the HDM model and its associated EBM model,&#13;
developed by the World Bank, to assess maintenance and rehabilitation strategies for the existing network&#13;
and to optimize these strategies under budgetary constraints in order to determine the best possible&#13;
allocation of funds. The HDM model simulates road deterioration and computes the road maintenance&#13;
and vehicle operating cost streams for each of the strategies being evaluated, as well as the economic&#13;
indicator used to compare these strategies, i.e., the net present value (NPV) of benefits to society. The&#13;
EBM model is an optimization program used to select, under budget constraints, for each road a strategy&#13;
that maximizes the net benefits to society of the group of roads being evaluated. Details of the analysis&#13;
are presented in Annex 7, and the following provides a summary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
A. Road Network Characterization&#13;
5.2    Based on road inventory data and road condition and traffic surveys carried out, the network was&#13;
divided into more than 300 uniform sections, with an average length of 9 km and uniform characteristics&#13;
with respect to traffic, condition and road width. Road condition was assessed using the International&#13;
Roughness Index (IRI). According to the results of the roughness survey, about 13.1 percent of the&#13;
network surveyed is in Good condition (IRI &lt; 4), 47.8 percent in Fair condition (4 &lt; IRI &lt; 6), 35.7 percent&#13;
in Poor condition (6&lt;IRI &lt;9) and 3.3 percent in Critical condition (IRI&gt;9). To evaluate the whole&#13;
Lebanese network the road sections needed to be classified into homogenous "representative links"&#13;
according to the following criteria: (a) four road condition levels - Good, Fair, Poor and Critical; (b)&#13;
seven traffic volume ranges based on the Average Daily Traffic (ADT &lt; 400, 400-1000, 1000-2000, 2000-&#13;
3000, 3000-5000, 5000-10000, and &gt; 10000); and (c) four road width classes (one lane, narrow two&#13;
lane, two lane, and four lane). In total, 112 (4x7x4) representative links were established from the&#13;
combination of the variables described above. Traffic growth rates of 4 percent p.a. from 1995 to 2004&#13;
and 3 percent p.a. from 2005 to the end of the analysis period were assumed.&#13;
B. Costs and Benefits&#13;
5.3    Both construction costs and vehicle operating costs were converted to economic costs by&#13;
eliminating taxes, duties and subsidies. Distortions due to exchange rate variations were eliminated by&#13;
expressing the unit vehicle operating costs in US dollar terms and by computing the project costs&#13;
(construction and future maintenance) in US dollars (see Annex 7, Tables 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4).&#13;
Vehicle Operating Costs&#13;
5.4   In order to establish the Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) for the common vehicle types in&#13;
Lebanon, a vehicle operating costs survey was carried out around the Greater Beirut area. The vehicle&#13;
fleet was characterized by six vehicle types: cars, pickups, buses, medium trucks, heavy trucks and&#13;
articulated trucks. For each vehicle type, financial costs of fuel, tires, new vehicle prices and labor costs&#13;
were collected. In order to arrive at economic costs, shadow pricing techniques have been used to adjust&#13;
financial costs and thus eliminate the effects of transfer payments (mainly taxes, import duties and&#13;
subsidies). Annex 7, Table 7.2 shows the vehicle characteristics and economic unit costs used in the&#13;
analysis. Annex 7, Table 7.3 shows typical unit vehicle operating costs at different levels of road&#13;
roughness obtained using the Vehicle Operating Cost model of the HDM.&#13;
Rehabilitation Strategies&#13;
5.5    A series of feasible periodic maintenance and rehabilitation operations (four overlay thicknesses&#13;
and two reconstruction types) were identified and the corresponding unit costs and characteristics were&#13;
defined. Annex 7, Table 7.4 shows the unit costs of maintenance operations used in the analysis. For&#13;
links in fair to critical condition, an optimal rehabilitation operation, based on engineering principles, was&#13;
adopted as the first periodic action and this action was assumed to take place either in the first year&#13;
.1997) or postponed to the second through the eighth years. Also, for each link a different (lower&#13;
standard) first periodic operation was evaluated taking place on the same years. In all cases, after the&#13;
first periodic action is executed, it was assumed that it would be followed by condition-responsive&#13;
overlays of 6 cm activated at roughness of 4.0 IRI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
C. Five-Year Budget Constraints&#13;
5.6   The rehabilitation strategy for the network was evaluated using the EBM model for a number of&#13;
budget scenarios; the changes in NPV and average roughness of the network are shown in Annex 7,&#13;
Figures 1 and 2. In all cases, the recurrent expenditures as well as the periodic expenditures after year&#13;
7 were left unconstrained. The no-budget constraint case presents the theoretically optimal solution,&#13;
which is not practical because it produces an unequal distribution of the program. In this case, most of&#13;
the expenditures take place in the first year followed with few expenditures in years 2 to 5. A uniform&#13;
budget constraint of US$60 million/year represents a more practical solution that yields an expenditure&#13;
program of about US$254 million in the first five years. A number of budget constraints (US$50 million&#13;
to US$10 million per year) were tested to assess the effect on the overall program and study the resulting&#13;
changes in the network condition. Based on these assessments, the final rehabilitation program was&#13;
developed using a set of budget constraints over five years, which took into consideration the build-up&#13;
of iriplementation capacity and the objective of early completion of the rehabilitation program. This&#13;
selected budget scenario (Scenario H in Annex 7), called for budgets of US$35 m, US$45 m, US$50 m,&#13;
US$55 m and US$50 m in years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.&#13;
D. Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.7   The economic evaluation and the sensitivity analysis is shown in Annex 7, Table 7.5; the results&#13;
are summarized  in Table 8 below.   As can be expected, the economic returns of a&#13;
rehabilitation/maintenance program are extremely high. For the overall rehabilitation program, the NPV&#13;
for the selected expenditure program (Scenario H in Annex 7) is on the order of US$3,300 million for&#13;
an expenditure of US$498 million (constant 1995 US$). The internal rates of return (IRR) are&#13;
consequently high (&gt; 100%), but suffer from the implicit assumption that the benefits generated during&#13;
the course of the project can be reinvested at the rate of return of the investment elsewhere in the&#13;
economy during the life of the project, which is unlikely in view of the high returns being generated.&#13;
Therefore, the modified IRR has been calculated, which assumes that returns are reinvested at the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital in the economy (around 12%); this yields a much lower (modified) IRR. The&#13;
modified IRR estimated for the Road Rehabilitation Program is 30 percent. Table 8 shows the results&#13;
of changes in costs and benefits. The high returns are not significantly affected by a 15 percent increase&#13;
in costs and decrease in benefits, whose combined effect reduces overall NPV to US$2,772 million and&#13;
the IRR to 28 percent.&#13;

3. 15 percent Decrease in Benefits             29.0                   2,804&#13;
4. Combined (2) and (3)                        28.0                   2,772&#13;
5.8    More generally, the project's benefits can be viewed in relation to the overall Lebanese economy.&#13;
The efficiencies expected would translate to net savings of about US$140 million per year in reduced&#13;
vehicle operating costs and road maintenance expenditures once the RRP has been implemented and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
proportion of poor condition roads has been reduced to about 15 percent of the network. From a fiscal&#13;
point of view, the road user charges established under the RRP will reduce the burden on the&#13;
Government's budget imposed by road maintenance expenditures. Funding road maintenance from user&#13;
charges would result in budget savings on the order of 2-3 percent, which would help reduce the present&#13;
high budget deficit (38 percent of expenditures in 1996).&#13;
5.9    The road sections selected for the first year pilot rehabilitation program (see Attachment 1 of&#13;
Annex 2) have an NPV, at a 12 percent discount rate, of US$137.3 million for an expenditure of&#13;
US$20.6 million. These road sections were selected from the overall RRP so as to provide an adequate&#13;
distribution of the pilot program among the four Regional Directorates of Roads, and are not necessarily&#13;
the sections with the highest rates of return. In general, it has been agreed that the RRP will use a&#13;
minimum 15 percent threshold IRR for approving road works to be included in the annual rehabilitation&#13;
programs.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
5.10   The major risk for the NRP is the country risk attached to all projects in Lebanon. If present&#13;
trends continue, these risks should reduce as the country enjoys increasing political stability and as&#13;
progress made in the Middle East peace process. Implementation risk for the proposed project, as well&#13;
as for the overall Road Rehabilitation Program, relate to: (a) the present weaknesses in the&#13;
implementation capacity of DOR and the consequent need for institutional reform; and (b) the need to&#13;
secure significant financial resources for the rehabilitation program. With regard to the former, the&#13;
project design seeks to mitigate the institutional capacity risk through establishment and support for a&#13;
Program Implementation Unit with adequate powers in the areas of planning, resource allocation,&#13;
procurement and monitoring of works implementation. In particular, the procurement authority of the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works, which is critical to effective implementation of the project, has been confirmed&#13;
by the Government.  In relation to the financing risk, there is the possibility of  delays in the&#13;
implementation of the road user charges and in the establishment of the Road Fund. These delays could&#13;
jeopardize financing of the RRP but would not affect implementation of the NRP-funded works&#13;
themselves. Increases in fuel taxes in July 1995, which increased fuel prices by 38 percent, makes&#13;
establishment of the Road Fund and implementation of road user charges in the near term difficult for&#13;
the Government. These financing risks are mitigated by the Government's commitment, set out in a&#13;
detailed Statement of Road Sector Policy, to implement full cost recovery and to achieve self-financing&#13;
in the road sector through a system of road user charges.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1    Since this project concept already constitutes a significant challenge for the Government in&#13;
developing new processes to improve the effectiveness of roads administration, issues to be addressed&#13;
under the project have been restricted to those that are critical to the implementation and sustainability&#13;
of the project. The following were agreed at loan negotiations:&#13;
(a) Actions taken prior to Board Presentation:&#13;
(i)    Government has confirmed the Statement of Road Sector Policy (para. 3.2); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(ii)    Government has provided to the Bank the Ministry of Justice's legal opinion&#13;
confirming that the Ministry of Public Works will be able to apply procurement&#13;
procedures satisfactory to the Bank and to follow the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, once Parliament ratifies the Loan Agreement, which requires the use&#13;
of Bank Guidelines for all procurement (para. 4.9).&#13;
(b) Actions to be taken during project implementation:&#13;
(i)    The MPW will conduct a Road User Charges study to establish an appropriate&#13;
level and structure of road user charges and will submit the results for review by&#13;
the Bank no later than September 30, 1997 (para. 3.3); and&#13;
(ii)    MPW will conduct annual reviews of the Road Rehabilitation Program (RRP) to&#13;
ensure that the program is appropriately prioritized and that works included have&#13;
an internal rate of return above 15 percent, and the Government will ensure that&#13;
the RRP is adequately funded (paras. 3.4 and 5.9).&#13;
bas.ed on the above agreements, the proposed project would provide a suitable basis for an IBRD Loan&#13;
to the Lebanese Republic of US$42 million at the Bank's Standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US&#13;
dollar-denominated single currency loans, with 17 years' maturity, including 5 years of grace.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Statement of Road Sector Policy&#13;
Approved by the Council of Ministers on May 9, 1996&#13;
1.    The Government of Lebanon, with a view to achieving improved efficiency in the roads sector,&#13;
adopts this Statement of Road Sector Policy as the guiding principle for the future development of the&#13;
sector. The objectives of the Government's Road Sector Policy are as follows:&#13;
(a)   to develop the national road network in ways that promote regionally and socially&#13;
balanced development of the country;&#13;
(b)   to preserve the existing road network, which is a major infrastructure asset critical to the&#13;
nation's economic well-being, in a cost-effective manner and enhance its safety and&#13;
efficiency;&#13;
(c)   to reduce the reliance of the road sector on the Government's recurrent budget and&#13;
increase efficiency in road use over time, by recovering from users the cost of providing&#13;
roads;&#13;
(d)   to create a strong institutional capacity in the road sector capable of deploying modern&#13;
planning, design and management technologies to achieve the objectives of this policy;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   to develop the capacity of the road sector to mobilize resources to finance the&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement of the road network.&#13;
This Statement of Road Sector Policy sets out and elaborates the mechanisms and policies by which the&#13;
Government intends to achieve the above policy objectives.&#13;
1. Regionally and Socially Balanced Economic Development&#13;
2.     In developing the country's road network, and in all decisions related to the planning,&#13;
programmning and execution of road works, the Government will ensure that the expenditures incurred&#13;
provide net economic benefits sufficient to merit the use of scarce resources, and that these expenditures&#13;
promote regional and social balance in the economic development of the country. Promotion of regional&#13;
and social balance through expansion of the road network to areas needing improved access, through&#13;
works programs which increase employment opportunities, or through contracting arrangements which&#13;
encourage the growth of a diverse and dynamic road construction industry, are therefore considered&#13;
worthwhile activities within this policy framework for the road sector. In furtherance of this policy, the&#13;
Government will require that all major works planned for the road sector, including new investments,&#13;
rehabilitation and capacity improvements, will be subjected to social and environmental impact analysis&#13;
and to detailed economic cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
II. Preservation of the National Road Network&#13;
3.    In recognition of the fact that the national road network, among the nation's most expensive&#13;
infrastructure assets, has deteriorated as a result of neglect during the war and now more than a third of&#13;
the network is in poor condition, that timely maintenance avoids costly reconstruction later, that the&#13;
present poor condition of the network imposes excessively high costs on road users and results in&#13;
economic losses in the order of US$150.0 million per year, and that misuse of the network by some users&#13;
imposes unacceptable costs on all users, the Government places a high priority on the rehabilitation of&#13;
the road network and on the prevention of damage to roads caused by overloaded vehicles. The&#13;
Government's policy is to ensure that:&#13;
(a)    maintenance of the road network is adequately funded, and is accorded a high priority;&#13;
(b)    rehabilitation of the road network will be conducted in a systematic manner with&#13;
economically justified programming of works to address priority needs; and&#13;
(c)    a system of axle load controls, including the establishment of truck weigh stations at&#13;
appropriate locations on the road network, will be implemented.&#13;
Implementation of a Road Rehabilitation Program (RRP) designed to restore the national road network&#13;
is therefore accorded a high priority by the Government.&#13;
III. Cost Recovery in the Roads Sector&#13;
4.    The traditional "public goods" approach to funding the road sector from the general tax revenues&#13;
of the Government is now widely recognized as unnecessary since the major determinant of the cost of&#13;
provision and upkeep of a modern road network is the motor vehicle; and the motor vehicle user can be&#13;
charged for road use through a number of mechanisms, such as a road user surcharge on motor fuels,&#13;
vehicle license fees, and other such cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
5.    Full cost recovery from road users for rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network would&#13;
be achieved gradually over a period of three to five years between 1998 and 2003. Specific road user&#13;
charges to be used to achieve full cost recovery, would be developed through a detailed Road User&#13;
Charges Study to be completed by September 30, 1997.&#13;
IV. Strengthening Institutional Capacity in the Roads Sector&#13;
6.    Cost effective implementation of a rehabilitation program on the scale envisaged under the Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program will require strengthening of institutional capacity in the roads sector.&#13;
Weaknesses in the DOR cause expenditures on roads not to achieve commensurate results. The capacity&#13;
of DOR has been severely diminished owing to the loss of personnel during the war years, and the ability&#13;
of DOR to re-establish its institutional capacity is constrained by limitations in areas such as its ability&#13;
to recruit trained personnel, to enter into contracts, and to mobilize necessary financial resources. These&#13;
considerations require, as an integral part of the RRP: (i) the strengthening of DOR in its role as&#13;
implementing agency responsible for construction, maintenance and improvement of the classified road&#13;
network; and (ii) the establishment of the necessary institutional set-up mandated to mobilize resources&#13;
for the road sector, monitor their efficient use and remain responsive to the needs of road users.&#13;
&#13;

7.     Upon finalization of the results of the road user charges study, and its approval by the&#13;
Government, the Government will prepare draft legislation to implement the road user charges and&#13;
establish the necessary institutional change. Such legislation shall be submitted to Parliament by February&#13;
28, 1998.&#13;
8.     Upon implementation of the road user charges, and subject to the approval of Parliament,&#13;
revenues from such charges would be deposited in a Trust Account at the Banque Du Liban called the&#13;
Road Fund. A portion of these revenues would be used solely for the rehabilitation, improvement and&#13;
maintenance of the classified network, with the remaining being transferred to the Ministry of Municipal&#13;
and Rural Affairs as a contribution to their maintenance of internal roads. The proportion to be allocated&#13;
to the classified network would be determined as part of the road user charges study. The road user&#13;
charges established would be appropriately adjusted for inflation on an annual basis, and would be subject&#13;
to change by the Council of Ministers acting on the recommendations of the Minister of Public Works.&#13;
9.     Upon approval of the road user charges study by the Government, the Government will send to&#13;
Parliament a draft law.  Upon its approval by the Parliament, the Government will establish an&#13;
institutional set-up under the tutelage of the Minister of Public Works, designed to:&#13;
"Implement a system of road user charges which will mobilize the financial resources&#13;
needed to improve the existing national road network and enhance its safety and efficiency,&#13;
and to ensure the efficient utilization of these resources"&#13;
This institutional set-up would be responsible for financing the rehabilitation, improvement and&#13;
maintenance of the classified road network, and establish procurement rules based on competitive&#13;
tendering, and would be authorized to approve contracts awarded in accordance with these rules.&#13;
V. Transitional Arrangements&#13;
10.   Prior to the introduction of the institutional change, the Ministry of Public Works will establish&#13;
a Program Implementation Unit (PIU) which will be responsible for the overall planning, programming,&#13;
budgeting and monitoring of the initial implementation of the Road Rehabilitation Program. In carrying&#13;
out its functions, the PIU will consult with a committee of road users appointed by the Minister of Public&#13;
Works.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Project Description, Cost Estimates, and Financing Plan&#13;
1.    The National Roads Project would help finance a three-year pilot program of urgently needed&#13;
road rehabilitation works and the necessary technical assistance in support of the Government's Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program.&#13;
I. Project Description&#13;
2.    The main components of the proposed project are:&#13;
A.    Road Rehabilitation Works. A three-year pilot program to rehabilitate about 400 km of&#13;
selected international, primary and secondary roads distributed among the four Regional&#13;
Directorates of Roads.&#13;
B.    Technical Assistance to:&#13;
(i)   support the MPW's Program Implementation Unit (PIU) in planning and&#13;
programming  works,  preparing  guidelines  for  and  reviewing&#13;
feasibility/environmental studies, undertaking all procurement actions necessary&#13;
for the project, and monitoring outputs;&#13;
(ii)   carry out a detailed road user charges study to recommend the level and structure&#13;
of tariffs;&#13;
(iii)  assist in the preparation of laws and regulations to implement the Statement of&#13;
Road Sector Policy; and&#13;
(iv)   strengthen the Directorate of Roads capacity to develop and implement the Road&#13;
Rehabilitation Program, including preparation of feasibility/environmental studies&#13;
and supervision of works.&#13;
C.    Equipment. Procurement of vehicles, computers, office equipment, road laboratory&#13;
equipment, traffic counting equipment and axle-load control equipment for better&#13;
management of roads.&#13;
3.    With the assistance of consultants, the Ministry of Publics Works selected about 3,500 kilometers&#13;
of road sections that require rehabilitation and has undertaken an economic evaluation to identify those&#13;
of highest priority. About 400 kilometers of road sections would be included for rehabilitation under the&#13;
project as a pilot road rehabilitation program. The pilot program will be implemented in three successive&#13;
groups of projects to be launched during the first three years of the project in order to technically and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
economically improve the rehabilitation and pavement strengthening strategies recommended by the RRP&#13;
preparatory studies (see Project Working Papers). The road sections selected for the first year of the pilot&#13;
program are shown in Attachment 1.&#13;
4.     The pilot road rehabilitation projects will be carried out in accordance with the design standards&#13;
established for the Road Rehabilitation Program (see Project Working Papers). All the works will be&#13;
carried out on existing alignments, except for local improvements to meet standards requirement and those&#13;
for traffic safety consideration. Rehabilitation will consist mainly of pavement strengthening and drainage&#13;
improvements. Road intersections will be corrected and "blackspots" will be eliminated to reduce road&#13;
accidents, and on all project roads safety barriers, road signs, and road markings will be provided. To&#13;
increase the level of service of the road network, the carriageway of the classified roads will be widened&#13;
as rights-of-way permit, and when the required expropriation does not imply resettlements to achieve the&#13;
minimum objective of 7 meter wide carriageway and 1.5 meter wide shoulders for international and&#13;
primary roads, and 6 meters and 1.5 meters for secondary roads. Procedures for designing strengthening&#13;
needs and methods of economic analysis of each individual road section will be refined during the course&#13;
of the project.&#13;
5.     During the first year of the pilot program about 150 kilometers of rehabilitation works will be&#13;
launched including portions of the international road No. 005 between Masna'a and Dnabe (29 krm), the&#13;
primary road No. 004 between Tripoli and Kab'aet (40 km), the primary road No. 033 between Raifoun&#13;
and BeKfaya (23 km), the primary road No. 025 between Bekfaya and Dahr Al-Harf (27 km), and the&#13;
primary road No. 061 between Sour and Bent-Jbail (31 Iam). These sections are shown in Map IBRD&#13;
27480. The criteria for approval of the roads to be included in the second and third year of the pilot&#13;
program are: (i) quality of preparation and environmental analysis acceptable eo the Bank; and (ii)&#13;
economic rate of return of the investment at least equal to 15 percent.&#13;
6.     A road user charges study will recommend the appropriate level and structure of the tariff for the&#13;
provision of roads. The study will estimate the costs of operating and maintaining the entire network&#13;
of classified roads on a sustainable basis; define all costs that have to be met through user charges;&#13;
evaluate the traffic (composition and volume) expected to use the road network at different time horizons;&#13;
and estimate the variable costs attributable to each type of traffic to propose the appropriate road tariff&#13;
including its structure (fuel levy, license fees, and, if relevant, heavy vehicle license fees), level, and&#13;
revision and adjustment mechanisms. Important considerations in setting user charges would be to reduce&#13;
the environmental impacts of excessive fuel use, and to recover from heavy vehicles the higher costs they&#13;
impose through increased pavement damage. Surcharges on petrol/diesel, heavy vehicle fees, etc., would&#13;
be the primary user charges utilized. As it will be difficult to introduce major changes in user charges&#13;
at one time, a phased program of user charge increases is to be developed with initial shortfalls in cash&#13;
flows being covered by borrowings against future revenues. Such a program of user charge increases&#13;
would include appropriate corrections for inflation and productivity enhancements. Since the level of&#13;
road user charges would be based on assessments of the cost of maintaining the existing network, any&#13;
network expansion or other extraordinary expenditures without compensating revenues (e.g., tolls on a&#13;
new road) would require additional increases in user charges. TORs for the Road User Charges Study&#13;
are in the Project Working Papers.&#13;
7.     The technical assistance to implement the Statement of Road Sector Policy will support the&#13;
preparation of: (i) the required draft legislation and executive decrees to create a Road Fund and&#13;
implement road user charges; (ii) the Road Fund financial projections; (iii) an internal auditing system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
and book-keeping procedures to establish adequate financial controls prior to the start-up of Road Fund&#13;
operations; (iv) an appropriate management information system; and (v) the procurement guidelines,&#13;
procedures and standardized documentation to be used by the Program Implementation Unit. It will also&#13;
assist in the implementation of the appropriate systems and processes for planning, budgeting, and&#13;
monitoring of outputs and for the preparation of guidelines for feasibility and environmental studies of&#13;
road projects.&#13;
8.    The overall objective of the technical assistance to DOR is to enable DOR to implement the RRP&#13;
works by strengthening its capacity to implement road maintenance and rehabilitation works. More&#13;
specifically, it will assist DOR prepare and supervise the implementation of the project works component&#13;
(pilot program). Consultants will help prepare and perform the tasks related to:&#13;
(i)    Road works implementation: detailed engineering, procurement activities, and&#13;
implementation support;&#13;
(ii)   The Road Pavement Management System and assistance to a technical complex to be&#13;
established within DOR and which would include the DOR laboratory;&#13;
(iii)   Training actions for DOR staff, locally and overseas, including technical visits and&#13;
seminars;&#13;
(iv)   Operating procedures, manuals, and technical guidelines for annual road programs,&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation projects (including detailed engineering), road safety&#13;
audits, marking and signing, economic analysis, environmental analysis, works&#13;
implementation, and quality control; and&#13;
(v)    Project management and management information systems.&#13;
Detailed TORs for the Technical Assistance to DOR are in the Project Working Papers.&#13;
9.    A preliminary list of equipment to be provided under the Loan including vehicles, computers,&#13;
office technology equipment, equipment and materials for road laboratory and field testing, traffic&#13;
counting equipment, vehicle weighing equipment, and special vehicles for surveying road conditions is&#13;
given in Table 2.3&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
1. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
1.    A Program Implementation Unit (PIU), established within the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)&#13;
will oversee all the project activities. The PIU will be responsible for coordinating implementation,&#13;
monitoring progress (including preparation of progress reports), and processing disbursement requests.&#13;
The MPW will be responsible for carrying out all project procurement activities in accordance with the&#13;
Bank Guidelines.   To undertake such activities, the PIU  will be staffed with Procurement&#13;
Specialists/Consultants acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
2.    The PIU will be staffed with the following five professionals:&#13;
(a)    A transportation planner to manage the project and to oversee the road rehabilitation&#13;
planning and programming processes. The planner will also be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the institutional and financial reform of the road sector, particularly&#13;
for the road user charges study.&#13;
(b)    A highway engineer responsible for overseeing the detailed design and bid document&#13;
preparation for the project road works component and for monitoring progress in&#13;
implementation of the overall Directorate of Roads (DOR) rehabilitation and maintenance&#13;
works. The engineer will also be responsible for overseeing DOR's production of the&#13;
guidelines for road rehabilitation projects (detailed engineering, economic evaluation,&#13;
environmental assessment, and supervision), and for supporting the technical assistance&#13;
to DOR component of the project.&#13;
(c)    A financial analyst responsible for assisting in the preparation of the draft decrees and&#13;
legislation required for implementing the institutional and financial reform, and for&#13;
preparing and updating financial projections. The financial analyst will also prepare&#13;
internal system audit and book-keeping procedures in order to establish adequate financial&#13;
controls.&#13;
(d)    A systems analyst responsible for overseeing the transfer to DOR of the road database for&#13;
the international, primary and secondary road networks developed by the project&#13;
preparation consultants, and for developing DOR's data collection system for regularly&#13;
updating the condition and works history of the road network. The systems analyst will&#13;
also prepare a project management information system to monitor procurement,&#13;
schedules, loan covenants, performance indicators, expected costs at completion, and&#13;
project accounts (including commitments and disbursements), and to report progress and&#13;
keep track of historical changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(e)    A procurement specialist responsible for carrying out all the project procurement&#13;
activities, and for preparation of the procurement guidelines, procedures, and&#13;
standardized documentation.&#13;
3.     The MPW will establish, staff, and maintain the above organizational arrangements for efficient&#13;
project execution. In addition to the staffing of the PIU, the MPW will ensure that DOR designates four&#13;
professionals to serve as the key counterparts for technical assistance in pavement management system,&#13;
road rehabilitation, road maintenance, and environmental assessment. They will have the following&#13;
responsibilities:&#13;
(a)    The Pavement Management System Counterpart will implement the Road and Pavement&#13;
Management System initiated during the Road Rehabilitation Program (RRP) preparatory&#13;
studies to conduct the planning and programming of road projects, traffic counts, reports&#13;
on road condition, the required studies and programs to develop appropriate pavement&#13;
design standards, and other road management and quality control activities. This&#13;
counterpart will also be responsible for developing the DOR laboratory and for reviewing&#13;
the detailed designs of road projects. The overall objective is to initiate and develop an&#13;
efficient and qualified Road Technical Complex to improve road sector efficiency and&#13;
technical standards. The four regional directorates of roads will be involved in the road&#13;
data collection activities so that the collections can benefit from their experience and&#13;
knowledge of the roads' condition and operation, and to enhance their responsibilities as&#13;
managers of road networks.&#13;
(b)    The Road Rehabilitation Counterpart will prepare and oversee the implementation of the&#13;
road rehabilitation projects in close coordination with the four regional directorates of&#13;
roads.&#13;
(c)    The Road Maintenance Counterpart will prepare and oversee the implementation of the&#13;
road maintenance works in close coordination with the four regional directorates of roads.&#13;
(d)    The Environment Unit Chief will head an environment unit to be established within DOR&#13;
with the support of the project technical assistance to carry out environmental impact&#13;
analysis and develop environmental guidelines for road projects.&#13;
4.     A comprehensive mid-term review involving the Government and the Bank will be carried out&#13;
within three years of project effectiveness but no later than June 30, 2000. This review will be based&#13;
on the various monitoring indicators agreed and set out in Table 3.1 below.&#13;
II. Monitorable Targets and Performance Indicators&#13;

Ill. Supervision Plan&#13;
7.     It is c;tiriu.tedl that 14 missions would be needed over the project execution period, with one&#13;
large project ilception mission initially to launch the project.  Total staffweeks for supervision is&#13;
estimated t1o be !)n the order of 100 staffweeks distributed among a project team (transport economist,&#13;
highway engineer, project finance) and other specialists. Project supervision would be based on the&#13;
agreed set of project monitoring and development impact indicators which are presented in Table 3.1.&#13;
The Bank input indicated in Table 3.2 below (68 staffweeks) is in addition to regular supervision needs&#13;
at headquarters for handling correspondence and reviewing/commenting on procurement actions,&#13;
disbursement -equcs;ts, progress reports, annual audits, consultants' inception/draft final/final reports, etc.&#13;
which are estnimated to take 4 staffweeks for each of the first two years and 3 staffweeks for each of the&#13;
four remainhile \cars in all 20 staffweeks. Other specialists may also participate in supervision missions&#13;
as re jlrci,v     II 1a1)NM, institutional development, and procurement specialists for an additional 12&#13;
staffveck. r';cl t'1; Jfc of th1e project). This level of input (100 staffweeks) is dictated by the relative&#13;
importance of the technical assistance components, and the complexities attached to the institutional&#13;
strengtheninig supported by the project.&#13;

Procurement Arrangements&#13;
1.    The MPW will be responsible for carrying out all project procurement activities in accordance&#13;
with the Bank Guidelines. To undertake such activities, the PIU will be staffed with Procurement&#13;
Specialists/Consultants acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
2.    The MPW could designate CDR as procurement agent for any project element where CDR has&#13;
a corrparative advantage.&#13;
3.    The Bank-financed civil works and equipment would be procured under the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. Consulting services financed under the Loan would&#13;
be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the Bank as Executing Agency. During the project launch workshop, it will be stressed that Bank&#13;
procedures must be followed if misprocurement is to be avoided.&#13;
4.    Under the project, the proposed methods of procurement would include International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) and International Shopping (IS).&#13;
5.    International Competitive Bidding (ICB). All civil works for the pilot road rehabilitation&#13;
program (project's component A) will be awarded using International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines and Bank standard bidding documents&#13;
for bidding and prequalification. Procurement documentation and decisions relating to all civil works&#13;
contracts will be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Contracts packaging of works will&#13;
be done with due consideration of costs efficiency, economies of scale, and promotion of the local&#13;
construction industry participation. It is estimated that the equivalent of about US$61.5 million (90.7&#13;
percent of the total estimated project cost) will finance the pilot road rehabilitation program component,&#13;
which will be implemented in 12 ICB contracts of more than US$3.5 million equivalent each.&#13;
6.    Equipment and Goods. All contracts for equipment and goods of more than US$200,000&#13;
equivalent each would be awarded using ICB procedures and will be subject to prior review and approval&#13;
by the Bank. Contracts for equipment and goods of less than US$200,000 will be procured through&#13;
international shopping procedures based on comparison of three price quotations from at least two&#13;
countries. The total aggregate of such contracts should not exceed US$1,000,000. It is estimated that&#13;
the equivalent of about US$1.5 million (2.2 percent of the total project estimated cost) will finance the&#13;
project's equipment component.&#13;
7.    Services. Consultant and training services for the project's technical assistance components will&#13;
be contracted in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. These services,&#13;
totalling about US$4.8 million (7.1 percent of the total project estimated cost), include studies, training,&#13;
engineering designs, and construction supervision services for which proposals will be requested from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

three to six shortlisted firms. For consultancy assignments financed by the Bank under the project, there&#13;
would be prior review for contracts worth $100,000 and above for contracts with consulting firms and&#13;
$50,000 and above in the case of contracts with individual consultants.&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Envirominental Analysis and Actions&#13;
1.    Since the project comprises roads rehabilitation works and procurement of equipment, it is not&#13;
expected to have any major environmental impacts. The road works involve rehabilitation, widening,&#13;
and maintenance along existing road alignments. Even so, the works implemented under the National&#13;
Roads Project (NRP) will incorporate environmental considerations at each stage from design to&#13;
completion. The environmental analysis of the first-year program will be reviewed prior to negotiations.&#13;
2.     Environmental issues in the proposed project mainly concern indirect impacts, and the potential&#13;
negative direct impacts are negligible. Among the issues to be considered are drainage, erosion, quarries,&#13;
sand excavation, disposal of waste materials, and the damaging effects of asphalt mix plants. The&#13;
magnitude and importance of negative impacts, together with the improvement of environmental&#13;
conditions and traffic safety, will be assessed and specific mitigatory actions will be carried out during&#13;
implementation. Road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance will involve very little realignment (and&#13;
when it is necessary, realignment will be limited to small curve correction or safety-related blackspot&#13;
treatment). Road works will essentially include widening within existing rights-of-way limits, drainage&#13;
improvements, non-treated base courses and asphalt concrete overlays. Most granular materials will be&#13;
supplied from existing quarries or quarry sites.&#13;
3.     Environmental guidelines will be prepared for road rehabilitation works and their use will be&#13;
required under the project. Within the contract documents, a specific chapter on environment will be&#13;
required to cover noise, dust, replanting, and waste material disposal issues, and must include a&#13;
restoration plan for asphalt mix plant areas after the works are completed. The DOR's road laboratory&#13;
will be required to measure dust emissions around asphalt plants, especially near urban areas. Similarly,&#13;
safety guidelines for road projects will be prepared, and will be required to be implemented on all works.&#13;
Road safety studies (safety audits) will be carried out to identify and correct blackspots.  Special&#13;
guidelines will be introduced concerning the safety of road users and workers for the works being carried&#13;
out in traffic.&#13;
4.     Designs and implementation plans for each road will include the environmental improvements and&#13;
mitigation measures as set out in Table 6. 1. Works contracts will include environmental clause&#13;
provisions, including financial guarantees, related to: origin of quarry material (with incentives to use&#13;
quarries with approved environmental management plans); location of borrow sites; location and&#13;
ilanagement of stockpiling areas and work depots; location and pollution control of asphalt concrete&#13;
plants; location of work camps and worker accommodations; storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous&#13;
products; procedures to prevent and control soil, water, air, and noise pollution; procedures for road user&#13;
safety; traffic management plans for construction vehicles and diverted traffic; restoration of all work&#13;

LEBANESE REPUBLIC&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Maintenance &amp; Rehabilitation of Lebanon Road Network&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    During the past few years, the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) initiated several efforts to meet&#13;
the minimum requirements for the maintenance of the classified network. However, there was an urgent&#13;
need to define a cost effective program for the rehabilitation and strengthening of the classified road&#13;
network and to develop an overall road maintenance strategy. Such a program would allow the present&#13;
backlog of maintenance work to be progressively reduced over the coming few years, and would ensure&#13;
that the funds available for maintenance works are allocated in the most cost effective manner. The&#13;
Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) has developed such a program supported by a&#13;
network economic evaluation based on the Highways Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM)&#13;
and the supporting Expenditure Budgeting Model (EBM), which have been developed by the World Bank.&#13;
This program is presented in the study: Identification, Preparation and Economic Evaluation of a Five-&#13;
Year Road Rehabilitation Program, prepared by consultants engaged by CDR.&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
2.    The objectives of the study are: (a) to define the optimal budget requirements for an overall road&#13;
maintenance strategy for the rehabilitation and strengthening of the classified road network (excluding&#13;
local roads); (b) prepare a five-year program based on this overall network economic evaluation,&#13;
including a first year priority program; (c) to quantify the economic benefits of such a program and the&#13;
expected improvements on the current level of service; and (d) to quantify the consequences of adopting&#13;
sub-optimal strategies due to budget constraints.&#13;
B. Methodology&#13;
3.    The study was composed of two phases. Phase I involved the data collection process and&#13;
economic analysis to define the priority program, and Phase II prepared detailed designs for the first year&#13;
program. Data was collected describing the current roadway characteristics and traffic, the expected&#13;
traffic growth, the vehicle fleet characteristics and unit costs, the road maintenance operations unit costs,&#13;
and the characteristics of the maintenance strategies to be evaluated. The data collected for the road&#13;
inventory included, among others, the horizontal and vertical alignment, cross sections, pavement type,&#13;
and drainage characteristics. Network surveys included a traffic survey, a limited axle load survey, a&#13;
roughness and visual pavement condition survey, and a vehicle operating costs survey. The network&#13;
under study comprises 2,787.8 km of International, Primary and Secondary roads where data was&#13;
available. Local roads and the remainder of the International, Primary and Secondary roads (mainly in&#13;
the occupied parts of South Lebanon) were not included in this study. The former was excluded from&#13;
the scope of the analysis, while the latter (about 100 km) were not covered due to difficulties of access&#13;
and data collection in the buffer zone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;

4.    The HDM and EBM models have been used to assess maintenance and rehabilitation strategies&#13;
for the existing network and to optimize the maintenance strategies under budgetary constraints in order&#13;
to determine the best possible allocation of funds. The HDM model simulates road deterioration and&#13;
computes the road agency and vehicle operating cost streams for each of the strategies being evaluated,&#13;
as well as the economic indicator used to compare these strategies, i.e., the net present value (NPV) of&#13;
benefits to society. The EBM model is an optimization program used to select, under budgetary&#13;
constraints, for each road a strategy that maximizes the net benefits to society for the group of roads&#13;
being evaluated.&#13;
Road Network Characterization&#13;
5.    Based on the inventory data and the condition and traffic surveys, the network under study was&#13;
divided into more than 300 uniform sections with an average length of 9 km and uniform characteristics&#13;
with respect to traffic, condition and road width. Road Condition was assessed using the International&#13;
Roughness Index (IRI). According to the results of the roughness survey, about 13.1 percent of the&#13;
network surveyed is in Good condition (IRI &lt; 4), 47.8 percent in Fair condition (4 &lt; IRI &lt; 6), 35.7 percent&#13;
in Poor condition (6 &lt; IRI &lt; 9) and 3.3 percent in Critical condition (IRI &gt; 9). The findings of the traffic&#13;
survey revealed that close to 61 percent of the estimated traffic is concentrated on about 320 kilometers&#13;
of Intemational and Primary roads (about 13 percent of the network).&#13;
6.    For the HDM model to be used to evaluate the whole Lebanese network, the road sections were&#13;
classified into homogenous "representative links" by various engineering and traffic variables. The&#13;
sections were grouped into representative links based on the following criteria: (a) four road condition&#13;
levels - Good, Fair, Poor and Critical; (b) seven traffic volume ranges based on the Average Daily&#13;
Traffic (&lt;400, 400-1000, 1000-2000, 2000-3000, 3000-5000, 5000-10000, and &gt; 10000); and (c) four&#13;
road width classes (one lane, narrow two lane, two lane, and four lane). In total, 112 (4x7x4)&#13;
representative links were established from the combination of the variables described above. Table 7.1&#13;
shows the analytical matrix that represents the road network surveyed.&#13;
Vehicle Operating Costs&#13;
7.    In order to establish the Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) for the common vehicle types in&#13;
Lebanon, a passenger and goods vehicle operating costs survey was carried out around the Greater Beirut&#13;
area. From the surveys, it was found that the average age of passenger vehicles is 14 years, whereas for&#13;
goods vehicles the average age is 18 years. For each vehicle type, financial costs of fuel, tires, new&#13;
vehicles and labor were collected. In order to arrive at economic costs, shadow pricing techniques have&#13;
been used to adjust financial costs and thus eliminate the effects of transfer payments, mainly taxes,&#13;
import duties and subsidies. Table 7.2 shows the vehicle characteristics and economic unit costs used&#13;
in the analysis. Table 7.3 shows typical unit vehicle operating costs at different levels of road roughness&#13;
obtained using the HDM model.&#13;
Maintenance Strategies&#13;
8.     A series of feasible periodic maintenance and rehabilitation operations (four overlay thicknesses&#13;
and two reconstruction types) were identified, and corresponding unit costs and characteristics were&#13;
defined. Table 7.4 shows the unit costs of maintenance operations used in the analysis. For all links,&#13;
a periodic maintenance action can be expected immediately or in the near future. Therefore, we are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
interested in evaluating this first action as well the effects of postponing it. For links in fair to critical&#13;
condition, an optimal rehabilitation operation, based on engineering principles, was adopted as the first&#13;
periodic action and this action was assumed to take place in either the first year (1996) or postponed to&#13;
the second to the eiglith year. Also, for each link, a different (lower standard) first periodic operation&#13;
was evaluated taking place in the same years. In all cases, after the first periodic action is executed, it&#13;
was assumed that it would be followed by condition-responsive overlays of 6 cm activated at roughness&#13;
of 4.0 IRI. For links in good condition, the first maintenance action was assumed to take place between&#13;
years four and eleven, followed by condition-responsive overlays of 6 cm at roughness of 4.0 IRI.&#13;
Five-Year Budget Scenarios&#13;
9.     The HDM  model was run using the HDM  Manager 3.0 for all representative links with an&#13;
analysis period of 20 years, a discount rate of 12 percent and a traffic growth rate of 4 percent from 1995&#13;
to 2004 and 3 percent from 2005 upto the end of the analysis period. The optimal strategy for each link&#13;
was found using the EBM model for the following budget scenarios:&#13;
Scenario A: No budget constraints&#13;
Scenario B: Periodic expenditures limited to US$60 mi/year&#13;
Scenario C: Periodic expenditures limited to US$50 n/year&#13;
Scenario D: Periodic expenditures limited to US$40 m/year&#13;
Scenario E: Periodic expenditures limited to US$30 m/year&#13;
Scenario F: Periodic expenditures limited to US$20 m/year&#13;
Scenario G: Periodic expenditures limited to US$10 m/year&#13;
Scenario H: Periodic expenditures limited to US$35, US$45,&#13;
US$5, US$55 &amp; US$50 m in years 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5&#13;
In all cases the recurrent expenditures were left unconstrained as well as the periodic expenditures after&#13;
year seven. The no budget constraint case (scenario A) presents the theoretically optimal solution, which&#13;
is not practical because it presents an unequal distribution of the program in the first five years. In this&#13;
case, most of the periodic expenditures takes place in the first year followed with few expenditures in&#13;
years two to five. This solution is not realistic but it is computed to give us the total periodic&#13;
expenditures needed for the first five years, in this case is US$260.0 million. Scenario B presents&#13;
uniform periodic expenditures of US$60.0 million/year, representing a more practical solution that yields&#13;
about US$254.0 million in the first five years. Scenarios C to G present different budget constraint cases&#13;
where the yearly uniform periodic expenditures are being reduced gradually. Finally, Scenario H&#13;
presents the budget over the next five years based on an assessment of the maximum practical&#13;
rehabilitation expenditures considering institutional capacity constraints.&#13;
10.   Having determined the optimal practical budget scenario and obtained the corresponding five-year&#13;
program, the next step was to determine the geographical distribution of the investments and compare&#13;
the distributon with the proportion of the network in each Muhafazat. This has indicated that the&#13;
distribution of expenditures are of the same magnitude as the proportion of the network in each&#13;
Muhafazat. The distribution of investments was then adjusted slightly to take into account other non-&#13;
economic factors. This regional analysis was then used as the basis for defining the actual work&#13;
program, which also considered other programming requirements, such as practicality of contract&#13;
packaging, bidding and execution.&#13;
&#13;

C. Network Analysis Results&#13;
11.   Table 7.5 shows the strategies selected by the HDM &amp; EBM models for each representative link&#13;
as a function of each budget scenario. Each strategy, other than the base strategy, is identified by a&#13;
strategy code that is divided into two parts. The first two digits identify the first operation to be&#13;
implemented and the last digits the timing of this first action (year). The possible operation codes are&#13;
the following: (a) 00 for 4 cm overlay; (b) 01 for 6 cm overlay; (c) 02 for 8 cm overlay; (d) 03 for&#13;
10 cm overlay; (e) 04 for 12 cm overlay; (f) RI for reconstruction with 3.5 SN; and (g) R2 for&#13;
reconstruction with a 5.0 SN. For example, for representative link "One lane / Poor / 0400" and for&#13;
the proposed budget scenario the selected strategy is 02 6, that is a 8 cm overlay to take place in year&#13;
6 as the first periodic action followed by 8 cm overlays at roughness of 4 IRI. Following this coding&#13;
system, we can identify, for each budget scenario, which links should be worked on each year and the&#13;
operation needed. Having obtained the solution for each representative link, we also obtain the solution&#13;
for each aniform road section that is a part of each representative link. These strategies were selected&#13;
by the F3M model with the objective of maximizing the network net present value (NPV) of benefits to&#13;
society under varying budget constraints or levels of implementation capacity. The resulting NPVs for&#13;
each budget scenario, as well as the agency expenditures required to implement each scenario are also&#13;
gi/en in Table 7.5.&#13;
Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
12.   As can be expected, the economic returns of a rehabilitation/maintenance program are extremely&#13;
high. For the overall rehabilitation program, the NPV for the selected expenditure program (Scenario&#13;
H) is on the order of US$3,335 million for an expenditure of US$498.0 million (constant 1995 US$).&#13;
The internmtl rates of return (IRR) calculated are consequently high (&gt; 100%), and suffer from the implicit&#13;
assumption that the benefits can be reinvested at the (high) rate of return of the investment, which is not&#13;
likely in view of the high returns being generated. Therefore, the modified IRR has been calculated,&#13;
which assumes that returns are reinvested at the opportunity cost of capital in the economy (around 12%),&#13;
and this yields a much lower (modified) IRR. The modified IRR estimated for the Road Rehabilitation&#13;
Program is 30 percent. Table 7.5 shows the results of changes in costs and benefits, and the high returns&#13;
are not significantly affected by a 15 percent increase in costs and decrease in benefits, whose combined&#13;
effect reduces overall NPV to US$2,772 million and the IRR to 28 percent.&#13;
Projected Network Improvements&#13;
13.    Figure I presents graphically the relationship between the rehabilitation programn's net benefits&#13;
to society and the average annual periodic agency expenditures. We can see that scenarios A, B, and C&#13;
yield slightly higher benefits than the proposed scenario H that was selected based on the institutional&#13;
capacity of MPW. We can also observe the more drastic economic consequences of reducing the average&#13;
agency expenditures to levels below US$30.0 million/year (Scenarios F, G). Figure 2 shows the resulting&#13;
network level of service for each budget scenario. The graph shows the average network roughness over&#13;
the analysis period (20 years) for each budget scenario. We can see that for the proposed budget scenario&#13;
H, the overall nctwork roughness over the next 20 years will be around 4.0 IRI. For scenarios D to G,&#13;
reducing th agency expenditures will increase the network roughness and the resulting vehicle operating&#13;
costs, yielding lower total costs to society than scenario H.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
14.   Figure 3 presents the evolution of the network condition over the next six years under the&#13;
proposed budget scenario H. This graph shows the percentage of the network length in Good, Fair and&#13;
Poor/Critical condition. The first year (1995) represents the current network condition and the following&#13;
years show the expected improvements due to implementation of the proposed program. The percent of&#13;
the network in Good condition (roughness &lt; 4.0 IRI) will increase from around 13 percent to 87 percent&#13;
over the five years. Figure 4 shows the expected network utilization over the next five years for the&#13;
proposed scenario. The graph presents the total network utilization, in million vehicle-kilometers per&#13;
year, and the percent of the vehicles driving on Good, Fair and Poor/Critical roads, and shows that in&#13;
year 2001 the great majority of users will be serviced by good roads.&#13;
Projected Work Program Requirements&#13;
15.   Figure 5 presents the yearly financial periodic expenditures required to implement the proposed&#13;
scenario H, by operation type. For this scenario, the yearly recurrent expenditures required, for patching&#13;
and routine maintenance, are about US$4.4 million per year. We can see that in the first two years the&#13;
resources will be used mostly on 10 to 12 cm overlays, the third and fourth years will be dedicated&#13;
mostly to 6 to 8 cm overlays and reconstructions will mostly be done in year five. Figure 6 presents the&#13;
work program in kilometers for the proposed scenario H by operation type. In the first two years around&#13;
300 kilometers per year will be worked on, in year three around 550 kilometers will be worked on, and&#13;
in years four to six around 400 kilometers per year of works will be undertaken.&#13;
16.   Figure 7 presents, for the proposed scenario H, the average periodic expenditures per km needed&#13;
to implement the scenario for three, four-year periods starting in 1996. We can see that in the first four-&#13;
year period (1996-99), the network needs yearly expenditures in the order of US$16,500 per km and after&#13;
the backlog is eliminated the yearly requirements are reduced to around US$9,000 per km in the second&#13;
four-year period, and US$4,500 per km in the third four-year period, i.e., the network is stabilized in&#13;
about ten years.&#13;
D. Evaluation of the Sections to be Financed by the Loan&#13;
17.   The pilot program  to be financed under the proposed loan was selected from the overall&#13;
rehabilitation program, and the individual road sections included in this pilot program were subjected to&#13;
specific economic evaluations. In selecting the pilot program components, economic merit was not the&#13;
sole criterion since the pilot program's components were to be used as demonstration projects, to develop&#13;
improved maintenance standards and project implementation procedures in each of the four regional&#13;
directorates. Therefore the rates of return obtained on the pilot program do not correspond to the highest&#13;
rates of return available within the overall program. Attachment 1 to Annex 2 presents the NPV for the&#13;
first year of the pilot program components, and shows that each component has a positive NPV at a 12&#13;
percent (real) discount rate.&#13;

            The objectives of the National Roads
            Project are to: (1) implement a pilot road rehabilitation
            program in support of the Road Rehabilitation Program; (2)
            strengthen institutional capacity for maintenance and
            development of the national road network; and, (3) reduce
            reliance on the Government's budget by requiring users
            to pay for the provision of roads. The main components of
            the project are: (A) road rehabilitation works, a three year
            pilot program to rehabilitate about 400 km of selected
            international, primary, and secondary roads; (B) technical
            assistance to: (i) support the Ministry of Public
            Works' Program Implementation Unit in planning and
            programming works, preparing guidelines for and reviewing
            feasibility/environmental studies, undertaking all
            procurement actions necessary for the project, and
            monitoring outputs; (ii) carry out a detailed road user
            charges study to recommend the level and structure of
            tariffs; (iii) assist in the preparation of laws and
            regulations to implement the Statement of Road Sector
            Policy; and (iv) strengthen the capability of the
            Directorate of Roads to develop and implement the Road
            Rehabilitation Program, including preparation of feasibility
            / environmental studies and supervision of works; and (C)
            procurement of vehicles, computers, office equipment, road
            laboratory equipment, traffic counting equipment and
            axle-load control equipment for better management of roads.
