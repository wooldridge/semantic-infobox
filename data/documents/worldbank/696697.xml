REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         Republic of Ghana&#13;
Implementing&#13;
Agencies:         Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (Lead&#13;
Ministry); Technical Services Centre of Ministry of Works and&#13;
Housing; Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies of Accra,&#13;
Kumasi, Shama-Ahanta East (Sekondi-Takoradi), Tema, and&#13;
Tamale.&#13;
Beneficiaries:    All residents of the five cities (total about 3.5 million); sanitation&#13;
and upgrading would target some 500,000 low-income people.&#13;
Poverty:          Included in Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Credit Amount:    SDR 47.8 million (US$71.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:            Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity.&#13;
Project&#13;
Description:      The project would cover Ghana's five major cities (Accra, Kumasi,&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale). It would have five main&#13;
components: (i) storm drainage, (ii) sanitation, (iii) solid waste,&#13;
(iv) upgrading of low-income urban areas, and (v) capacity-&#13;
building. Physical components represent about 83 percent of total&#13;
project costs; capacity-building, design and supervision services&#13;
the other 17 percent. The drainage component would improve&#13;
primary and secondary drains to alleviate chronic flooding&#13;
problems in Accra, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi. The sanitation&#13;
component would cover all five cities and include high-priority&#13;
household, school, and public sanitation facilities as well as&#13;
septage treatment and disposal facilities. Emphasis would be&#13;
placed on strengthening the capacity of city governments to plan&#13;
and manage sanitation services while contracting with private&#13;
providers for most construction, operation, and maintenance&#13;
functions. Assistance in solid waste would cover the development&#13;
of new landfill sites in Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale.&#13;
The project would also provide financial and technical assistance&#13;
for the privatization of refuse collection and equipment&#13;
maintenance in all the cities. The community upgrading&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
component would cover seven lower-income areas in Accra,&#13;
Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi. Upgrading sub-projects comprise&#13;
drainage, water supply, sanitation, solid waste, roads, paths, and&#13;
street lighting. The upgrading component is being undertaken with&#13;
active community participation in preparation and implementation.&#13;
The capacity-building component would provide technical&#13;
assistance, training and equipment to improve the ability of the five&#13;
participating MAs to manage basic services. Special emphasis&#13;
would be given to cost accounting of waste management, contract&#13;
management and local financial administration. The project would&#13;
also seek to improve the capacity of the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) and other central&#13;
government agencies involved in the environmental sanitation&#13;
subsector.&#13;
Financing Plan:    IDA                     US$71.00 m.&#13;
Gov't                    US$ 8.94 m.&#13;
Local Gov'ts &amp; Benef.    US$ 5.32 m.&#13;
Co-Financing*            US$ 4.01 m.&#13;
*Nordic Development Fund ($3.40 m.); Netherlands ($0.60 m.)&#13;
Benefits:         (i) The project's improvements in drainage, sanitation, and waste&#13;
management would contribute to better hblih and thereby raise the&#13;
productivity of residents, especially the poor, in the five cities.&#13;
Some components, such as solid waste landfills, would have city-&#13;
wide benefits. The sanitation and community upgrading&#13;
components would benefit around 600,000 lower-income people.&#13;
Although it is well-established that major urban health problems,&#13;
including diarrhea, intestinal parasites, and vector-borne diseases,&#13;
require adequate sanitation and waste management, the health&#13;
benefits of these interventions are not quantifiable due to&#13;
methodological limitations. (ii) Economic rates of return (ERRs)&#13;
have been calculated for the storm drainage works (35 percent of&#13;
project cost) based on quantification of benefits from flood&#13;
allviation including damage to buildings, land, or other physical&#13;
property that would no longer occur and incremental losses of&#13;
income or productivity that would be prevented. The ERRs,&#13;
ranging from 32 percent to 48 percent, show that the drainage&#13;
investments would be amply justified. (iii) The project's capacity&#13;
building for improved local revenue mobilization, cost recovery,&#13;
and privatization of services would prolong the useful life of&#13;
facilities, improve efficiency, and mobilize additional funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
Risks:            (i) Project implementation may be delayed by the weak capacity of&#13;
the Metro and Municipal Assemblies. Under Ghana's emerging&#13;
sanitation and waste management policies, the MAs would&#13;
increasingly manage the work of private contractors who are to be&#13;
responsible for the direct provision of most infrastructure and&#13;
services. The project would attempt to minimize the risks&#13;
associated with the MAs' weak capacity by limiting the numbers&#13;
and sizes of components that each MA would manage; requiring&#13;
each MA to have a basic core staff assigned to the project;&#13;
providing support for the hiring of contractors to help with&#13;
technical and financial tasks; ensuring that the central&#13;
implementing agency supervises and monitors the MAs&#13;
adequately; and providing substantial training to the MAs'&#13;
officials and staff. (ii) Counterpart funds may not be available as&#13;
required. It would be addressed by keeping the required&#13;
counterpart fund contribution modest (10 percent for the GOG and&#13;
3.9 percent for the MAs as a group). The GOG and MAs'&#13;
combined contribution in the peak years of implementation would&#13;
represent only around 1.5 percent of the national 1996&#13;
development budget. (iii) Cost recovery and general local revenue&#13;
mobilization may not be implemented effectively, resulting in&#13;
inadequate maintenance. Household, school, and public sanitation&#13;
facilities pose a low risk, as these would be provided on a demand&#13;
basis and would depend largely on direct user maintenance.&#13;
Drainage also has a low risk of maintenance failure. Sensitivity&#13;
analysis indicates that primary and secondary drainage would&#13;
provide high economic benefits even if maintenance is well below&#13;
the optimum. This probably applies as well to the sanitary landfill&#13;
facilities. The septage treatment facilities would be simple,&#13;
modest-sized stabilization ponds with O&amp;M costs that are easily&#13;
absorbed by the cities' budgets. The risk of inadequate O&amp;M&#13;
funding is being addressed through (i) a credit covenant requiring&#13;
the MAs to allocate O&amp;M funds to separate program budget lines&#13;
for waste management and drainage, (ii) an intensive effort to build&#13;
ownership of the project on the part of the Metropolitan and&#13;
Municipal Assemblies during preparation and up to effectiveness,&#13;
and (iii) the provision of a considerable amount of capacity-&#13;
building relating to O&amp;M during implementation.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
1. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.   URBAN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Urban Economy&#13;
1.1   About half of Ghana's total GDP is non-agricultural, in industry and services.&#13;
These largely urban-based sectors of the national economy have been the most dynamic.&#13;
Between 1980 and 1994 the industry and services sectors grew on average by about four&#13;
percent and seven percent per year respectively, while the agriculture sector grew at about&#13;
one percent. Improved economic growth in Ghana over the medium term future will&#13;
depend in large part on achieving higher agricultural production and exports. At the same&#13;
time, growth of the agriculture sector is likely to foster the development of urban-based&#13;
activities linked to it. These include the processing of wood and other products, the&#13;
transfer and storage of farm outputs, and the provision of commercial and financial&#13;
services. Ghana's current drive to promote new investment, both foreign and domestic,&#13;
would also contribute to the development of new manufacturing enterprises (catering to&#13;
both the export and domestic markets) in urban areas.&#13;
1.2   Comparative country data show that economic development and urban growth are&#13;
closely linked, that per capita incomes are consistently higher in urban areas, and that&#13;
urbanization increases with economic growth more rapidly at lower income levels than at&#13;
higher ones. Ghana, with a GNP per capita of about $430 (1994) and about one-third of&#13;
its population urbanized, has a substantially smaller portion of its national economy in&#13;
non-agricultural sectors than other countries with similar income and urbanization levels.&#13;
This suggests that, as Ghana's national economic performance continues to improve, the&#13;
share of urban-based economic activities is likely to expand considerably faster than in&#13;
the past.&#13;
1.3   The Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), which includes cities of Accra&#13;
and Tema, accounts for 15 to 20 percent of GDP and employs around 10 percent of the&#13;
national labor force (one third of the national urban labor force). Accra and Tema house&#13;
the majority of Ghana's industries, from micro-enterprises to large plants. Major&#13;
financial institutions, government ministries, parastatals, and multinational corporations&#13;
have their head offices in Accra. Accra's primary market linkages (as both a purchaser&#13;
and seller) are with Kumasi in the Ashanti Region and Sekondi-Takoradi in the Western&#13;
Region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.4   Tema is Ghana's primary port, handling about three quarters of all goods&#13;
shipments. The remainder goes through the port of Takoradi. Both Kumasi and Sekondi-&#13;
Takoradi have diversified economies comprising small-scale industry, trade, and services.&#13;
Tamale, the main city of the north, is a mainly a trading and governmental service center.&#13;
Urban Population&#13;
1.5   Economic growth in Ghana is bringing about a transition from a predominantly&#13;
rural to a quasi-urban society. Over the past three decades, the urban population,&#13;
estimated at 5.5 million in 1993, has consistently grown at a higher rate than the national&#13;
population. The level of urbanization--the proportion of total population living in urban&#13;
areas--rose from 26 percent in 1965 to 35 percent in 1993. The total population is&#13;
projected to reach 20 million by the year 2000. At the current urban growth rate of 4.2&#13;
percent per year, the urban population would double in 17 years. The country acquires&#13;
about 275,000 new urban dwellers each year, which is the equivalent of adding a city the&#13;
size of Kumasi every three years or four cities the size of Cape Coast each year.&#13;
1.6   There are approximately 185 urban settlements in Ghana, with the capital, Accra,&#13;
accounting for about one quarter of the urban population. The two largest cities, Accra&#13;
and Kumasi, together contain about 41 percent of the urban population, while the five&#13;
largest cities (Accra, Kumasi, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tamale) account for about 59&#13;
percent of the total (see Table 1). Regionally, about 60 percent of the urban population is&#13;
concentrated in the Greater Accra, Ashanti and Eastern regions, all three of which are&#13;
located in southern Ghana.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
Urban Poverty&#13;
1.7   The World Bank's Extended Poverty Study (1995), using data from the Ghana&#13;
Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) of 1987-88 and 1991-92, defined a monetary "poverty&#13;
line" of two thirds of mean per capita household expenditure (in constant May 1992&#13;
Accra prices). This is estimated at Cedis 132,230 per year (about US$300 using the&#13;
average 1992 exchange rate).&#13;
1.8   The data indicate that the national incidence of poverty (the proportion of the&#13;
population below the line) fell from 37 percent in 1987-88 to 31 percent in 1991-92. The&#13;
depth of poverty also declined: the mean expenditures of the poor were about 12 percent&#13;
below the poverty line in 1987-88 and about 8 percent in 1991-92. According to the data,&#13;
there were about 1.46 million poor people in urban areas in 1992. This breaks down into&#13;
about 350,000 in Accra and about 1.11 million in other urban areas. The gap between&#13;
urban and rural poverty appears to be much smaller than suggested by earlier profiles. In&#13;
1992 the incidence of poverty was 33 percent in the rural forest area and 38 percent in the&#13;
rural savannah area. The percentage of poor people was found to be 23 percent in Accra&#13;
and 28 percent in other urban areas. The national decline in poverty between 1988 and&#13;
1992 appears to be due mainly to an increase in non-farm self-employment and an&#13;
increase in crop production. While it is important for Ghana to focus on the alleviation of&#13;
rural poverty, it is critical to simultaneously address urban poverty issues and take&#13;
measures to address them before they assume unmanageable proportions.&#13;
1.9   The urban poor tend to cluster in identifiable areas of Ghana's major cities.&#13;
Various studies have shown that lower-income urban areas have the highest densities, the&#13;
lowest social indicators (education and health), and the lowest levels of infrastructure and&#13;
services. They also account for the vast majority of all epidemic and preventable&#13;
diseases. A 1991 survey of services in 17 lower-income communities in Accra yielded&#13;
the following profile:&#13;
Secondary roads are few and unpaved or non-existent. Many sections of&#13;
the communities are inaccessible by vehicle. In nine of the 17&#13;
communities the share of secondary roads rated "bad" was over 50 percent&#13;
(in five it was 70 percent or higher).&#13;
All the communities have pipe-borne water systems, but in 10 of the 17&#13;
communities less than half of the houses have connections. The quality&#13;
and reliability of the water supply varies.&#13;
Drainage is poor, with numerous localized flooding problems. The few&#13;
existing drains tend to be badly built and clogged by rubbish and silt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Sanitation is very bad: there are few household toilets or latrines; public&#13;
toilets are in disrepair; pan latrines are still widely used despite having&#13;
been banned; night soil is dumped in and around the communities and&#13;
flows into drains; large numbers of people defecate in the open.&#13;
Solid waste collection is erratic or non-existent; there are few communal&#13;
rubbish containers; sometimes these are not emptied regularly; open&#13;
rubbish dumps are common.&#13;
Most houses have electricity, but quality is substandard (low voltages and&#13;
interruptions).&#13;
Street lighting is non-existent or inadequate.&#13;
1.10 A 1991 household survey found that about one third of the low-income population&#13;
of Accra lacks access to piped water and must purchase water from vendors. These&#13;
households pay five to ten cedis per bucket, or about one cedi per gallon. Households&#13;
with access to metered or unmetered piped water pay about a quarter of this price. The&#13;
cost of purchasing water from vendors can come to 10 percent of the monthly income of&#13;
a low income household. This, together with the irregularity of water supplies and low&#13;
levels of health education, constrains the amount of daily water use by the urban poor for&#13;
drinking, cooking, and hygiene.&#13;
1.11  A 1993 study found that, of the 16 significant diseases reported in Accra, 13 are&#13;
linked to poor housing and ventilation, an unsanitary environment, contaminated&#13;
drinking water, poor drainage and lack of facilities for waste disposal. The higher&#13;
occurrence of disease in low-income areas means greater loss in work days and a higher&#13;
outlay of expenditure for medical attention for the poor than for those living in better&#13;
physical environments.&#13;
Institutional Framework for Urban Development&#13;
1.12 PNDC Law No. 207 (1988) initiated a shift in the structure of governmental&#13;
authority whereby the central government devolved to local government Assemblies the&#13;
responsibility for policy formulation, planning, and implementation with respect to,&#13;
among other things: community development, town planning, public works, roads and&#13;
streets, markets, sanitation, and motor parks. This shift of authority is occurring in two&#13;
directions: vertically from 22 central government ministerial departments to District&#13;
Assemblies; and horizontally, at the local government level, from GOG staff performing&#13;
executive functions to members of District Assemblies performing legislative functions.&#13;
Two thirds of the members of each District Assembly are elected. The latest local&#13;
government elections occurred in March 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.13 The Local Government Act of 1993, which replaced Law 207, gives District&#13;
Assemblies the power to "exercise political and administrative authority in the District&#13;
[and] provide guidance, give direction to, and supervise all other administrative&#13;
authorities in the District" (Article 10). The 1993 Act does not mention specific sectoral&#13;
functions of local Assemblies; but it devolves to them responsibility for "the overall&#13;
development of the District", "the development of basic infrastructure", the provision of&#13;
"municipal works and services", and the "management of human settlements and the&#13;
environment", among other activities. The 1993 Act also refines the structure of local&#13;
governments by distinguishing among three different types: Metropolitan Assemblies&#13;
(requiring at least 250,000 population); Municipal Assemblies (requiring at least 95,000&#13;
population); and District Assemblies (which must have at least 75,000 people within their&#13;
boundaries).&#13;
1.14  The assumption of responsibilities and building of capacity by local governments&#13;
will be a long-term process. Meanwhile, the Ministries of Works and Housing (MWH)&#13;
and Roads and Highways (MRH) continue to play major roles in urban development.&#13;
MWH is the implementing agency for larger drainage projects (mostly donor funded) in&#13;
the major cities. The Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC), a dependency of&#13;
MWH, remains the single national parastatal for water supply (though a major policy&#13;
decision to create several operating companies, commercialize services, and privatize&#13;
certain functions is being considered by the Government). The Technical Services Centre&#13;
(TSC) under MWH is the implementing agency for two World Bank-supported urban&#13;
projects (Urban II and the Local Government Development Project). MRH's Department&#13;
of Urban Roads (DUR) handles road construction projects in the five main cities&#13;
(including those financed by the World Bank).&#13;
1.15  The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) has the&#13;
mandate to: (a) develop policies and legislation with respect to local government; (b)&#13;
supervise and monitor local administration; (c) assist local governments in drafting by-&#13;
laws (and vetting them); (d) monitor the financial performance of the local govermments&#13;
and promote internal auditing of their accounts; (e) provide guidelines to local&#13;
governments with respect to revenue collection; (f) promote capacity-building of local&#13;
governments; (g) provide guidelines and technical assistance for the delivery of&#13;
environmental sanitation services; and (h) facilitate the provision of offices and&#13;
residential accommodation for local government staff. In addition, in the absence of&#13;
actual implementation of composite budgeting, the MLGRD serves as an interlocutor&#13;
between local governments and international donor agencies with respect to projects that&#13;
are appropriately implemented at the local level.&#13;
Urban Infrastructure and Services&#13;
1.16  Deficient urban services--water supply, sanitation, urban roads, and others--is a&#13;
major constraint on urban productivity in Ghana. Mobilizing more public and private&#13;
capital for investment in urban infrastructure is a major need, along with using financial&#13;
and institutional resources more efficiently. The huge gap between investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
requirements and actual funds likely to be available highlights the tremendous importance&#13;
of (a) cost recovery through user fees and local taxes and (b) the use of appropriate design&#13;
standards. With assistance from the World Bank, cost recovery for urban services is&#13;
steadily expanding, though much remains to be done. The use of appropriate, low-cost&#13;
standards, as opposed to conventional industrialized-country standards, can multiply the&#13;
effectiveness of investment between two and five times.&#13;
1.17  Water Supply: GWSC estimates that about 75 percent of the urban population is&#13;
covered by piped water systems, down from a high of over 90 percent in the late 1970s.&#13;
Total production capacity from piped systems equals around 85 liters per capita per day,&#13;
but about 50 percent of this water is lost or unaccounted for. The five main cities of&#13;
Ghana (Accra, Tema, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale) all suffer from insufficient&#13;
quantities of treated water, although it appears that the water that is produced is generally&#13;
of acceptable quality. Three large-scale piped water supply schemes (supported by IDA,&#13;
AfDB, and CIDA) are currently on-going at an estimated cost of $222 million, covering&#13;
87 systems responsible for over 80 percent of GWSC's production capacity.&#13;
1.18  Sanitation: Tema is the only urban center in Ghana with a comprehensive&#13;
waterborne sewage system (though presently it has no treatment, with sewage discharged&#13;
directly to the sea). The IDA-supported Urban II Project is rehabilitating the system,&#13;
which has fallen into disrepair. The central part of Accra has a limited waterbome&#13;
sewerage system to which very few properties are connected and which also has fallen&#13;
into disrepair. Other urban centers in Ghana rely on on-site excreta disposal systems.&#13;
Only about 40 percent of the urban population is estimated to have access to some form&#13;
of household sanitation facility. Of these, a small minority have flush toilets (almost all&#13;
connected to septic tanks), most have pit latrines, and a significant proportion use the&#13;
unsanitary pan or bucket latrines (whose contents must be disposed of manually each&#13;
day). Around 45 percent of the urban population relies on public toilets. The remainder&#13;
have no sanitation facility at their disposal. The few disposal facilities for liquid waste&#13;
(stabilization ponds) that exist in the major cities are inadequate and in poor condition.&#13;
Most of the waste goes directly into storm drains, lagoons, or the sea.&#13;
1.19  Urban Roads: GOG has given high priority to investment in urban roads over&#13;
the past decade, particularly in the five main cities. This was necessary to counter the&#13;
severe deterioration that arose from deferred maintenance throughout the 1960s and&#13;
1970s and to accommodate the significant increases in traffic. Future medium-term&#13;
interventions in the urban roads subsector should focus on carefully selected road&#13;
improvements and traffic management measures with high economic rates of return. A&#13;
further priority is the improvement and provision of access roads for lower-income urban&#13;
communities as part of integrated infrastructure upgrading programns.&#13;
1.20  Storm Drainage: None of Ghana's urban centers has a comprehensive storm&#13;
drainage system. Haphazard urban growth over the past decades has produced a situation&#13;
characterized by gaps between primary, secondary and tertiary drains and construction in&#13;
low-lying, flood-prone areas. Flooding, with related building and personal property&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
damage and traffic disruption, is a regular occurrence in urban areas during the rainy&#13;
season. The poor are affected most, because they have settled in the least desirable&#13;
locations in low lying areas adjacent to drains and water courses, where land is cheap or&#13;
has been informally settled. Garbage, sullage, and sewage are commonly deposited in&#13;
drains, creating a health hazard along the course of the drains and polluting the waters&#13;
into which they discharge. In the southern cities, receiving waters often form part of&#13;
sensitive coastal wetlands. While a significant amount have been invested in roadside&#13;
drainage in the major cities as part of road upgrading projects in recent years, primary and&#13;
secondary drainage has received little financing.&#13;
1.21   Solid Waste Collection and Disposal: Solid waste management is entirely a&#13;
local government service. Collection ratios (waste collected/waste generated) in the five&#13;
main cities are well below desirable levels: Accra 67 percent; Kumasi 45 percent; Tema&#13;
59 percent; Sekondi-Takoradi 42 percent; and Tamale 13 percent. The Accra and Kumasi&#13;
Waste Management Departments provide a limited degree of house-to-house collection&#13;
services in some of the lower-density, higher-income areas. In Tema's "township"&#13;
(planned city) area, rubbish is collected adequately by curbside pickup; however, no solid&#13;
waste services are provided in Tema's lower-income areas. A significant share of the&#13;
solid waste collection in Ghana's major cities is through communal containers and lift&#13;
vehicles. Much of the collection, however, is limited to the sporadic clearing of&#13;
neighborhood dumps by manual labor and tipper trucks. This is the norm in the&#13;
secondary towns. In all urban centers, heaps of uncollected rubbish are found in and&#13;
around built-up areas, especially lower-income communities. As mentioned earlier,&#13;
rubbish dumping is a major cause of blocked storm drains. In the main cities, waste is&#13;
deposited at large open dumps located in fringe areas, sometimes very close to&#13;
residences. None of the dumps is operated as a proper sanitary landfill. To date, no&#13;
special methods have been applied for the disposal of medical or industrial waste.&#13;
1.22  Urban Transport: Traffic congestion is now ubiquitous throughout Accra and is&#13;
also a problem in the centers of Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi. The national vehicle fleet&#13;
has grown at an average rate of 19 percent per annum since 1984. The great majority of&#13;
all motorized passenger trips are by public transport (taxis, tro-tros and buses). The&#13;
overall quality of public transport is poor. Most vehicles are old, many are converted&#13;
trucks, and maintenance standards are low. There appears to be a sufficient number of&#13;
vehicles to meet demand, with low-capacity vehicles such as taxis and minibuses&#13;
predominating and increasing their share of the market. This is of concern because small&#13;
vehicles carry fewer passengers per standard unit of road space than larger buses and&#13;
therefore exacerbate traffic congestion. Public transport and freight terminals, commonly&#13;
referred to in Ghana as lorry parks, serve all forms of vehicles from private cars and taxis&#13;
to multi-axled trucks. Few are paved, and there is no clear demarcation between access&#13;
roads, bus parking spaces, and passenger waiting areas. Facilities for passengers are&#13;
rudimentary or non-existent. Generally, the terminals have sprung in an ad-hoc manner,&#13;
with little account taken in their siting of the impact of the vehicle and pedestrian traffic&#13;
they attract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Municipal Finance&#13;
1.23  Improving urban infrastructure and services requires the mobilization of more&#13;
financial resources for both capital investment and O&amp;M. Details on revenues,&#13;
expenditures, and local finance problems of the five UESP cities are available in the&#13;
project files. Efforts to increase own source local government revenues in recent years&#13;
have centered on the revaluation of property rates and the collection of property taxes.&#13;
These measures have produced some gains, but their sustainability is subject to the ability&#13;
of local governments to become more responsive and accountable for the provision of&#13;
services. Local revenue collection remains far below its potential. It is estimated, for&#13;
example, that Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies are collecting between one tenth&#13;
and one third of the potential property taxes. Per capita total local revenue collected by&#13;
the five main cities is minuscule, averaging about US$1.25 in 1994. The collection of&#13;
many low-yielding taxes (such as the basic rate) is mandated by law. The Assemblies&#13;
thus tend to disperse their efforts in collecting numerous relatively unproductive revenues&#13;
rather than concentrating on a few productive ones.&#13;
1.24  Local government staff are appointed through the central civil service, and central&#13;
government transfers cover most of their salaries. As a result, local governments have no&#13;
incentive to use staff efficiently. Budget and financial systems remain archaic. Fees and&#13;
tariffs often bear little relationship to cost, and billing and collection systems are&#13;
inefficient and prone to corruption. To stimulate decentralization and the provision of&#13;
local infrastructure and services, the Government established the District Assemblies&#13;
Common Fund (DACF) in 1993. The DACF annually distributes to the Districts not less&#13;
than five percent of total GOG revenues specifically for development (capital&#13;
investment). The key issue with the DACF is avoiding a disincentive effect on local&#13;
revenue mobilization. The DACF allocation to the five MAs in 1994 totaled Cedis 3,303&#13;
million, about one third of their combined total revenues. Local governments in Ghana&#13;
have not yet been able to achieve consistent yearly budget surpluses. Until they do so,&#13;
they will not be capable of servicing debt.&#13;
1.25  Recent experience shows that the provision of technical assistance, training, and&#13;
equipment is necessary but not sufficient to achieve improved mobilization by local&#13;
governments of own source taxes and fees. Such inputs can produce short-term gains.&#13;
However, obtaining sustainable improvements in local revenue collection and&#13;
management is a long-term process related to changes in governance systems. It will&#13;
require developing incentives for local government politicians, executives, and staff to&#13;
view themselves principally as providers of services to the public. As the public develops&#13;
confidence in local government's responsiveness and competence, people's willingness to&#13;
pay higher taxes will grow.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
B.   SECTOR STRATEGIES&#13;
Decentralization&#13;
1.26 The most important government policy related to urban development is the recent&#13;
decentralization initiative. Under the 1992 Constitution and the Local Government Act&#13;
(No. 462) of 1993, Ghana's Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies are&#13;
autonomous local governments with legislative and executive powers within their areas.&#13;
They are empowered to prepare and approve their annual budgets, to raise revenues from&#13;
taxes and fees, to borrow funds, to acquire land, and to provide basic services and local&#13;
infrastructure. A Letter of Local Government Development Policy prepared by the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) in conjunction with&#13;
the latest IDA-financed urban project focuses on two key points. First, Local&#13;
Governments should eventually be able to employ their own staff accountable to them.&#13;
The 1993 Act calls for the creation of a Local Government Service, and proposals for this&#13;
are being studied. Second, the Assemblies are to have discretion in selecting of projects&#13;
to be financed with revenues of the District Assemblies Common Fund.&#13;
Urban Development&#13;
1.27 An Urban Strategy Review carried out in 1993-94 with World Bank support&#13;
produced the following main conclusions: (a) continued improvements in basic urban&#13;
infrastructure and services are needed to increase the productivity of urban households&#13;
and firms, but investments must be carefully selected; (b) infrastructure and services for&#13;
the urban poor can be improved through targeted upgrading programs; (c) urban service&#13;
delivery should be made more efficient and sustainable by greater competition, more&#13;
reliance on commercial principles, private sector participation, and attention to demand;&#13;
(d) further efforts are needed to obtain long-lasting improvements in revenue&#13;
mobilization by local governments; (e) sanitation and waste management are the highest&#13;
priority urban environmental problems; and (f) impediments to land transfer, land titling&#13;
and private land development need to be removed to make urban areas more efficient and&#13;
productive. These points are consistent with a 1993 Ghanaian Task Force proposal for a&#13;
human settlements strategy (prepared with assistance from UNDP and UNCHS) which&#13;
reflects a broad national consensus on four basic elements: (a) improving the economic&#13;
performance of towns and villages, with particular attention to strengthening the&#13;
economic linkages between urban and rural productive sectors; (b) increasing access to&#13;
basic services; (c) improving the living conditions of the poor and vulnerable groups; and&#13;
(d) building human capacity for urban planning and management.&#13;
Urban Environment and Sanitation&#13;
1.28  The Government's 10 year (1991-2000) National Environrental Action Plan&#13;
(NEAP) includes urbanization as one of four main areas for intervention. The NEAP&#13;
highlights sanitation and waste disposal as major issues. It lists the implementation of&#13;
urban waste management and sanitation projects as a top priority. It also calls for the&#13;
improvement of drainage in coastal cities; the establishment and implementation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
environmental and health standards; and the adoption of effective land use control&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
1.29  At appraisal, a draft Letter of Sector Policy for Environmental Sanitation was&#13;
reviewed. Key themes covered in the letter are private sector participation and the&#13;
financial sustainability of services. The final version of the letter was agreed upon at&#13;
negotiations and it was singed by the Minister for Local Government and Rural&#13;
Development, thus fulfilling the single condition of Board presentation.&#13;
External Assistance&#13;
1.30  Foreign assistance agencies are supporting capital investments in urban&#13;
infrastructure and capacity-building in urban management. The bulk of the urban-related&#13;
external capital funding is currently going into urban roads and water supply. IDA is the&#13;
major source of financing in the urban roads sector through the Urban II, Urban&#13;
Transport, and Local Government Development Projects. IDA, AfDB, and several&#13;
bilaterals are assisting in water supply, mainly through the Water Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project. Urban sanitation, drainage and area upgrading have received very limited&#13;
funding. KfW and GTZ have been supporting a project to strengthen the Accra Waste&#13;
Management Department. ODA sponsored a similar, more limited project in Kumasi&#13;
during 1991-93. UNDP and UNCHS have been active in technical assistance for urban&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The objectives of the Urban Environmental Sanitation Project are:&#13;
(a)   To promote productivity and raise living standards in Ghana's major cities,&#13;
especially for lower-income people, by improving drainage, sanitation,&#13;
and solid waste services.&#13;
(b)   To help establish better institutional and financing mechanisms and more&#13;
effective policy frameworks so that improvements are sustained overtime.&#13;
(c)   To build up the capacity of the Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies to&#13;
manage environmental sanitation services.&#13;
B.   DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
2.2   The project would cover Ghana's five major cities (Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-&#13;
Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale). It would have five main components: (a) storm drainage,&#13;
(b) sanitation, (c) solid waste, (d) upgrading of low-income urban areas, and (e) capacity-&#13;
building. Physical components represent about 83 percent of total project costs; capacity-&#13;
building and consultancy services for design and supervision the other 17 percent.&#13;
2.3   The Urban Environmental Sanitation Project is part of the World Bank's Country&#13;
Assistanc Strategy (CAS) for Ghana. The basic goal of the CAS is poverty reduction&#13;
through rapid economic growth. The project would support four of the five objectives of&#13;
the CAS: (a) poverty reduction, by improving services which have high impact on the&#13;
productivity and welfare of the urban poor both city-wide and in lower-income areas; (b)&#13;
capacity-building, by strengthening the ability of the Metro and Municipal Assemblies to&#13;
plan and manage the delivery of basic services; (c) private sector development, by&#13;
promoting the contracting out of various waste collection and sanitation services; and (d)&#13;
environmental improvement, by directly addressing the highest priority urban&#13;
environmental problems through policies, institutional structures, and physical&#13;
investments.&#13;
2.4   The project was identified as a result of the Urban Development Strategy Review&#13;
conducted jointly by the World Bank and the Government in 1993-94. The Review&#13;
involved a series of seminars with representatives of central and local institutions&#13;
involved in the sector. As mentioned in Section I, the Review established a clear&#13;
rationale for the project: First, sanitation is one of the highest priorities in Ghana's&#13;
Environmental Action Plan. Second, sanitation, drainage and solid waste management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
supply--have been addressed through past and ongoing projects supported by the Bank&#13;
and other donors. Third, the project would deal with basic services whose deficiencies&#13;
constrain urban economic development and depress living conditions for large numbers&#13;
of people, especially the poor.&#13;
Storm Drainage Component&#13;
2.5   The focus of the storm drainage component (34 percent of the project's base cost)&#13;
is to alleviate flooding in built-up urban areas. The highest-priority interventions have&#13;
been selected in Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi. A detailed description of the&#13;
drainage component is in Annex 7.&#13;
2.6   Accra: Approximately 7 km. of the city's primary drainage channel, the Odaw,&#13;
from the Abossey Okai Road to the Motorway Extension, would be dredged and&#13;
reconstructed as a trapezoidal channel with top width varying from 45 to 65 m. This&#13;
would significantly alleviate flooding in major industrial, commercial, and residential&#13;
areas in and around the center of the city. About 20 km. of secondary drains serving 13&#13;
neighborhoods would be reconstructed, also for the purpose of alleviating flooding&#13;
affecting around 20,000 people. These improvements were identified as the highest&#13;
priorities in the 1991 Drainage Master Plan and Feasibility Study. This study included&#13;
simulations showing that inadequate capacity of primary and secondary drains is the&#13;
principal bottleneck in the drainage system, whereas silting of the Korle Lagoon&#13;
contributes very little to the flooding problem.&#13;
2.7   Kumasi: The project would finance measures to reduce flooding in the Central&#13;
Business District, covering the Central Market, the Asafo Market, and the Kejetia Lorry&#13;
Park (transport terminal). These would include (a) the construction of four new&#13;
secondary drains, (b) widening the existing primary channel from the Zoo through&#13;
Kejetia to the Asafo Market, and (c) reconstruction of a four km. stretch of the Nsuben&#13;
primary channel to a trapezoidal section with stone pitched lining.&#13;
2.8   Sekondi-Takoradi: A major desilting exercise would be undertaken to rid&#13;
covered drains in the Market Circle area of solid waste that has accumulated in them over&#13;
the years and restore the capacity of the existing drains. Additional capacity required in&#13;
the Market Circle drain, which is the main outlet from the Central Business District,&#13;
would be provided.&#13;
Sanitation Component&#13;
2.9   During project preparation each of the five MAs prepared a Strategic Sanitation&#13;
Plan (SSP) that sets out its strategy for providing comprehensive sanitation services by&#13;
the year 2005. The SSPs include a prioritized listing of the mix of household, public, and&#13;
school facilities needed to serve the city's low and middle income households. They also&#13;
present the management and financing arrangements needed to implement each&#13;
component. The SSPs differ from conventional master plans in that they (a) tailor&#13;
technical options to each type of housing in the city, (b) consider users' preferences and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
willingness to pay, (c) emphasize actions that can be taken within the medium term, and&#13;
(d) present components that can be implemented independently but which together&#13;
provide full coverage.&#13;
2.10  The MAs used their SSPs to identify the specific sanitation sub-projects that are to&#13;
be included in the UESP. The sanitation component represents about 10 percent of the&#13;
project's base cost. A summary of the facilities appears in Annex 8. The categories of&#13;
sub-projects are as follows:&#13;
2.11  Household sanitation facilities: In medium density areas of all five cities, the&#13;
project would help finance about 5,560 household latrines (expected to benefit a total of&#13;
about 200,000 people). The project would bear 50 percent of the construction costs, and&#13;
the beneficiaries would contribute the other 50 percent. The MAs would contract day to&#13;
day management of the household latrine programs to one or more private firms. Their&#13;
tasks would include training latrine construction contractors, reviewing applications,&#13;
awarding individual contracts, reviewing works and making payments (25 percent down&#13;
and 25 percent at completion). The programs would be promoted through local media by&#13;
the MAs' Waste Management Departments.&#13;
2.12  Public sanitation facilities: The project would support the construction of new&#13;
and the replacement or rehabilitation of old public sanitation facilities at markets and&#13;
other commercial locations in all five cities. A total of about 65 facilities would be built&#13;
or improved. Only those facilities offering the prospect of full cost recovery (based on&#13;
location and size) would be selected. The facilities would be operated on a franchise&#13;
basis. The MAs would contract with local firms to manage construction.&#13;
2.13  School sanitation facilities: The project would finance construction of about 305&#13;
sanitation facilities at primary and junior secondary schools in the five cities. Parent-&#13;
Teacher Associations (PTAs) would be able to obtain financing if they collect sufficient&#13;
funds in advance to cover one year's operation and maintenance costs and prepare a&#13;
management plan. MAs would contract with a local firm or NGO to implement the&#13;
school program. Its tasks would include promotion, assistance to individual PTAs,&#13;
contracting, supervision, and training. The Training Network Centre at the University of&#13;
Science and Technology at Kumasi would provide training materials. UST is doing&#13;
similar work for the National Community Water and Sanitation Programme.&#13;
2.14 Septage treatment and disposal; sewerage rehabilitation: All the MAs have&#13;
agreed to withdraw from direct septage hauling. This service will be turned over to&#13;
private operators. The project would finance the construction of a septage treatment&#13;
facility in each of the five cities. In Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale these would&#13;
be combined with the new sanitary landfill sites (see description of Solid Waste&#13;
Component, below). In Accra and Tema, the septage treatment facilities would be&#13;
separate. Septage would be treated in a ponding system; settled sludge would be mixed&#13;
with sawdust or similar material and either disposed in the landfill or composted for&#13;
resale as a soil conditioner. The project would also finance rehabilitation of selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
segments of the Tema sewer system in communities 1, 2, 4 and 5; an abattoir in Tamale;&#13;
rehabilitation of a sewerage system serving a modest-income housing area in Kumasi;&#13;
and an extension of water distribution in East Ashaiman of Tema, a lower-income area.&#13;
Solid Waste Component&#13;
2.15  Solid Waste Collection (5 percent of base cost): In recent years central and local&#13;
government officials have come to realize that they do not have to be the sole providers&#13;
of solid waste collection services, and that the private sector can be a cost effective&#13;
alternative. They are also recognizing the importance of consulting and involving users&#13;
in making decisions on the type of service to be provided and the means of paying for it.&#13;
2.16  The project would provide technical and financial support for privatized waste&#13;
collection in the Accra metropolitan area, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale, and the&#13;
Ashaiman area of Tema. Previous experience in Tema, Accra and Sekondi-Takoradi&#13;
indicates that households are willing to pay fees for an efficient, reliable service. While&#13;
this experience shows that user fees can cover the full costs of house-to-house collection&#13;
in upper income areas, it is unrealistic to expect the same in medium and low income&#13;
areas, where communal collection must be used. This is because willingness and ability&#13;
to pay are limited and it is difficult to organize the collection of fees for communal refuse&#13;
removal. The use of general revenues to help cover the cost of solid waste collection is&#13;
justified by the city-wide public health and environmental benefits.&#13;
2.17  The four MAs are receiving technical assistance for identifying areas to be served&#13;
by private waste collection, preparing financial projections, and determining contract&#13;
modalities. Experiences from other countries are being taken into account. In each case&#13;
the shares of the collection costs to be borne by user fees and general revenues would be&#13;
established. The project would finance a portion of the general revenue shares annually&#13;
on a declining basis. Preliminary financial analyses of likely contractors' costs (using&#13;
their own equipment and including depreciation, interest, labor, vehicle operating costs,&#13;
overheads, and profit) have been carried out. Specialist consultants would continue to&#13;
work with the MAs on the following: (a) establishing appropriate differential charges for&#13;
the different types of collection systems and socio-economic areas, (b) relating theoretical&#13;
contractors' costs (as established in the financial analysis) to actual costs incurred by the&#13;
contractors working in Tema, Accra, and Takoradi, (c) checking and refining the basic&#13;
data, (d) determining the appropriate contracting mechanisms, and (e) analyzing the sizes&#13;
of contracts that the MAs and UESP could support. The latter would be dimensioned&#13;
according to a reasonable, agreed projection of each MA's budgetary capacity.&#13;
2.18  Sanitary Landfills (16 percent of base cost including equipment): The project&#13;
would finance the construction of properly engineered sanitary landfills in Kumasi,&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale. Suitable sites have been identified in each city. The&#13;
MAs are negotiating acquisition of the sites with the owners. At negotiations it was&#13;
agreed that the financing of these facilities under the credit would be dependent on the&#13;
MAs having legally acquired the sites and assured adequate compensation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Topographical, soil, and geophysical surveys have been carried out, and the preparation&#13;
of preliminary engineering designs by specialist consultants is underway. The&#13;
consultants' TOR include assessing the environmental impacts of the facilities and&#13;
incorporating the needed mitigation measures in the designs. These would include&#13;
diverting storm water flows around the sites, collecting and treating leachate, and venting&#13;
gases produced by waste decomposition. The sites would also incorporate septage&#13;
treatment facilities. The consultants would assess the feasibility of treating the leachate&#13;
and septage together. Equipment for weighing, spreading, and compacting the waste&#13;
would be procured under the project. The possibility of having private contractors&#13;
operate the landfill facilities will be explored and encouraged, as experience from other&#13;
countries indicates that this is more effective than public management.&#13;
2.19  A detailed description of the solid waste component is in Annex 9.&#13;
Community Infrastructure Upgrading Component&#13;
2.20  The community infrastructure upgrading component (16 percent of base cost)&#13;
would be implemented in seven lower-income areas of Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-&#13;
Takoradi. The communities are: Sukura, Old Teshie, and West Maamobi in Accra;&#13;
Aboabo and Anloga in Kumasi; and Effia Zongo and Kwesimintsim in Sekondi-&#13;
Takoradi. These communities were selected by the MAs from longer lists of&#13;
infrastructure-deficient, lower-income areas which had already demonstrated some&#13;
community initiative and willingness to improve their living environments. A detailed&#13;
description of the community infrastructure upgrading component is in Annex 10.&#13;
2.21  In total about 530 hectares in which some 265,000 predominantly low-income&#13;
residents reside would be upgraded with a packages of basic infrastructure improvements.&#13;
These are: (a) access (vehicular roads and footpaths), (b) stormwater drainage, (c)&#13;
sanitation, (d) solid waste management facilities, (e) water supply, and (f) street lighting.&#13;
2.22  The final programs have been developed following strict cost targets, functional&#13;
standards and design service levels. One of the fundamental principles of the program is&#13;
that beneficiaries are to fully cover the operation and maintenance costs of the&#13;
infrastructure provided through fees or taxes. Available information on ability and&#13;
willingness to pay indicates that this is realistic. For example, residents of these&#13;
communities already pay substantial amounts monthly to purchase water from private&#13;
venders and to use public toilets. Surveys have shown that people are willing to pay for&#13;
the maintenance of infrastructure if service is reliable. These factors have been a key&#13;
determinant in decisions regarding design standards, prograrn size and costs. Likely&#13;
implementation capacity has also been taken into account in dimensioning the program.&#13;
2.23  Besides physical upgrading, the community infrastructure component aims to (a)&#13;
promote the use of demand-driven, participatory planning and design procedures and&#13;
functional, affordable standards and levels of service for infrastructure; (b) strengthen the&#13;
ability of Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies to collaborate with community&#13;
residents in the planning, design, implementation of infrastructure upgrading schemes so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
as to foster a sense of ownership by the communities; and (c) establish sustainable&#13;
arrangements for operation and maintenance. Details of the facilities to be upgraded,&#13;
their implementation, capital costs, estimated annual O&amp; M cost requirements, and O&amp;M&#13;
modalities are to be set out in a "Facilities and Management Plan" to which each&#13;
community (via a community based organization agreed upon with local leaders) and&#13;
relevant public agencies would formally agree. Each of the Assemblies has agreed to&#13;
contribute 10 percent of the capital costs of the upgrading component from its own funds.&#13;
2.24  Local leaders and residents are being actively involved at all stages of planning&#13;
and design. Meetings were held with focus groups including Assembly members, local&#13;
unit committee members, and representatives of non-governmental organizations&#13;
including women's groups. A household survey was carried out to determine the&#13;
coverage and quality of existing services and willingness to pay for improved services. A&#13;
series of workshops was conducted with community leaders and residents to discuss their&#13;
priorities, standards and service levels, the community's role in O&amp;M, and tradeoffs in&#13;
allocating the limited resources to be provided through the project.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Component&#13;
2.25 Local-Level Organization: The Ministry of Local Government and Rural&#13;
Development (MLGRD) and the five MAs have developed a basic organizational&#13;
framework for the local management of infrastructure and services. Each MA's technical&#13;
organization would be composed of a relatively small staff of professionals, technicians,&#13;
and support personnel. The main function of the staff would be to plan, manage,&#13;
coordinate, and supervise the work of contractors who would perform the bulk of the&#13;
provision of infrastructure and services. The staff would be organized in four&#13;
departments or units: (a) the Head Office of the technical organization, (b) the Waste&#13;
Management Department, (c) Roads and Drains, and (d) Development Control. The five&#13;
MAs already have some technical staff, but their numbers and qualifications are limited.&#13;
2.26 Building the MAs' human and organizational capacity to properly manage&#13;
infrastructure and services will be a long-term process. Among the MAs' main&#13;
constraints on achieving an adequately sized and qualified staff are low remuneration in&#13;
the public sector at all levels, the perception that central government service is preferable&#13;
to local government, and the difficulty of attracting well-qualified people to work outside&#13;
Accra and Kumasi.&#13;
2.27  These problems cannot be solved in the context of one Bank-supported project.&#13;
Some aspects are being dealt with separately. These include the ongoing Civil Service&#13;
Performance Improvement Program at the central level, to which the Bank is contributing&#13;
funding and advice, and the plans under discussion to establish a Local Government&#13;
Service (in which MLGRD is involved). The UESP would contribute to local capacity&#13;
building of the five MAs through the following measures: (a) assisting the MAs to&#13;
recruit additional qualified personnel through the hiring of individual contract staff, (b)&#13;
actively involving their existing officials and staff in project preparation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
implementation, (c) providing the MAs with technical assistance (mainly through local&#13;
consultants) in waste management and municipal finance (see below), and (d) providing&#13;
equipment and training. A number of capacity deficiencies are common to all the MAs.&#13;
Some have more experience in certain aspects, e.g. privatization in Tema, management&#13;
information and accounting systems in Accra, and health education and community&#13;
awareness in Kumasi. A wealth of well-documented knowledge exists from previous&#13;
assistance provided through German and British assistance programs.&#13;
2.28 Capacity-Building: A project-wide capacity-building and training (PWCBT)&#13;
program would be financed by the project. It would be overseen by MLGRD's Local&#13;
Government Support Unit. There would be two sources of financing: the Nordic&#13;
Development Fund, which would finance consultants, and the Association of Netherlands&#13;
Municipalities, which would finance a training program. The PWCBT would provide&#13;
assistance to the five MAs and relevant central government agencies. Its work would be&#13;
carried out by national consultants supported by a limited number of international&#13;
specialists who would provide knowledge not available locally. This group would&#13;
prepare an annual work program in response to the needs of the client institutions and the&#13;
activities of the UESP. The work program would be approved by the clients. Each year&#13;
the clients and the PWCBT group would review the effectiveness of its activities.&#13;
2.29 The PWCBT would cover two main areas, environmental sanitation and&#13;
municipal finances. About 270 person-months of consultant services would be financed.&#13;
The types of assistance to be provided would include but not be limited to:&#13;
* Drafting of local government by-laws for environmental sanitation.&#13;
*  Establishing and using performance monitoring systems for waste collection.&#13;
*  Developing and implementing cost accounting and management information&#13;
systems.&#13;
*  Compiling standard designs, specifications, and cost data on appropriate&#13;
technologies for sanitation, waste collection, treatment facilities, and disposal&#13;
systems.&#13;
*  Designing public enlightenment campaigns and preparing health education&#13;
materials.&#13;
*  Updating and maintaining data bases on municipal revenue collection.&#13;
*  Privatizing revenue collection using the commission system.&#13;
2.30  It is considered important for each Metropolitan or Municipal Assembly to&#13;
implement its own individual capacity-building activities, apart from those undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
the project-wide CPT program. The project will therefore finance a package of capacity-&#13;
building resources which will be available to each city to use as it wishes, as long as the&#13;
activities are relevant to UESP. With these resources, the MAs will be able to hire their&#13;
own consultants (with terms of reference cleared by MLGRD) and finance training&#13;
activities tailored to their specific needs. Each city will be required to submit an annual&#13;
capacity building and training plan for approval by MLGRD.&#13;
2.31  Each of the five MAs is establishing a project team which will be responsible for&#13;
day-to-day management of the city's sub-projects of the UESP. Regular staff of the MAs&#13;
will be assigned to work on the project team, along with three long-term contract staff to&#13;
be hired by each MA under the project. These will generally be a civil engineer, a&#13;
sanitary engineer, and an accountant.&#13;
2.32  The institutional strengthening component would include support for public&#13;
information campaigns in the five cities dealing with (a) public cooperation with refuse&#13;
collection and disposal, (b) household hygiene related to sanitation, (c) management of&#13;
public sanitation facilities. These activities would be carried out by contractors under the&#13;
supervision of the MAs.&#13;
2.33  A detailed description of the institutional strengthening component (about 13&#13;
percent of the project's base cost) is in Annex 11.&#13;
Land Titling&#13;
2.34 A Land Administration Pilot Project is being carried out under the Urban II&#13;
project. Its objective is to establish a system for issuing new land titles in accordance&#13;
with the Land Title Registration Law of 1986. It is being undertaken as a coordinated&#13;
exercise involving the Survey Department, the Land Title Registry, and the Lands&#13;
Commission. An international adviser has been working with these institutions on a&#13;
periodic basis since mid-1994. The pilot project is starting to produce results. Major&#13;
bottlenecks in the process have been documented, regular interagency coordination&#13;
mechanisms have been established, and improvements are being introduced to make the&#13;
system more efficient. The participating institutions believe that it is important to keep&#13;
up this momentum. As funding for the current pilot project will run out by mid-1996, the&#13;
UESP would provide a modest amount of additional resources (US$550,000) to be&#13;
focused on strengthening the field operations and records management of the Land Title&#13;
Registry and establishing a small unit in the Survey Department which would employ&#13;
digital methods on a routine basis in the production of Registry Maps and Registry Plans.&#13;
Details are in Annex 12.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
2.35  Waste management has been underfunded at the local government level. In many&#13;
cases, capital investments in civil works and equipment have outpaced the ability of the&#13;
Assemblies to cover operation and maintenance costs. The project will support initiatives&#13;
of the MAs to increase the funding of O&amp;M through both user fees and general revenues.&#13;
-- ----- --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
It has been agreed with the MAs that user fees should finance 100 percent of the O&amp;M&#13;
costs of household latrines, public toilets, piped sewerage, and septage removal. The&#13;
costs of solid waste collection would be financed by a combination of user fees and&#13;
general revenues. Surveys conducted during project preparation as well as prior&#13;
experience in Ghana indicate that house-to-house refuse collection can be carried out on a&#13;
full cost recovery basis. However, house-to-house collection is appropriate for only 20 to&#13;
50 percent of the population (depending on the city) living in low to medium density,&#13;
higher-income areas. The remainder of the population living in lower-income, higher&#13;
density areas must be served by communal collection systems. Because of low ability or&#13;
willingness to pay, user fees may cover only 20 to 30 percent of the costs of communal&#13;
collection. The operating costs of solid waste landfills and septage treatment facilities&#13;
may in principle be covered largely through tipping fees paid by private waste haulers.&#13;
However, this requires a licensing and enforcement capability that will take a long time to&#13;
establish in Ghana. In the short to medium term, the recurrent costs of these facilities&#13;
will have to be paid from general revenues. Roads and drains are public goods that must&#13;
be financed primarily through general revenues.&#13;
2.36  Assembly officials recognize that they must begin to set aside increasing amounts&#13;
of general revenues for the recurrent costs of waste management and for the upkeep of&#13;
facilities and equipment. Prior to credit effectiveness, MLGRD would issue a directive to&#13;
the five MAs requiring each of them to create separate budget lines for waste collection&#13;
and disposal and maintenance of storm drains. It was agreed at negotiations that the MAs&#13;
would allocate, as of the third year of implementation, appropriate amounts to be agreed&#13;
with IDA in these budget categories. Technical assistance would help the MAs to make&#13;
projections of the shares of O&amp;M costs to be met through user fees and general revenues&#13;
(i.e. property taxes, business license fees, etc.). MAs would have to budget annually for&#13;
the latter portion. Waste collection, maintenance of equipment, and drain cleaning would&#13;
be carried out by the private sector under contracts to the MAs. A study would be carried&#13;
out under the project to prioritize drainage maintenance needs so as to target scarce funds&#13;
most effectively. O&amp;M of water and street lighting in the community upgrading areas&#13;
would be handled by the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) and the&#13;
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG).&#13;
Client Consultation and Participation&#13;
2.37  One of the project's main objectives is to build the capacity of the Metropolitan&#13;
and Municipal Assemblies to provide environmental sanitation services. Accordingly, a&#13;
major concern of the project preparation process has been to foster ownership of the&#13;
project by the participating MAs and other involved institutions (e.g. TSC and MLGRD).&#13;
The client consultation and participation process consists of several formal activities&#13;
linked by continuous informal exchanges. The main activities are:&#13;
2.38 Initial Preparation Workshop: A two day project preparation workshop was&#13;
held in October 1994. This included the Chief Executives of the five&#13;
Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies, other local officials and staff, and several central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
agency representatives. The main objectives were to agree on the basic scope of the&#13;
project, to exchange information on urban environmental sanitation issues, and to&#13;
establish action plans for follow-up by each city. This event was funded by the UNDP-&#13;
World Bank Water and Sanitation program (West Africa Regional Office).&#13;
2.39 Municipal Finance Workshop and Consultations: Previous efforts to provide&#13;
technical assistance and training for improving municipal finances have had mixed&#13;
results. Sustainability has been disappointing. Nevertheless, better revenue mobilization&#13;
and financial management by Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies are essential if&#13;
urban sanitation services are to improve. The project supported (through the PPF) a study&#13;
of municipal finance trends and issues and a workshop with officials of the five MAs in&#13;
February 1995 to identify strategies and interventions. These are being used to identify&#13;
follow-up interventions and assistance to be provided under the project.&#13;
2.40 Consultations with Community Leaders and Residents: The community&#13;
infrastructure upgrading component in seven lower-income areas is being prepared with&#13;
the participation of community leaders and residents. A university research group&#13;
conducted community meetings, focus group discussions, household surveys, and&#13;
workshops with local leaders to identify community priorities, determine willingness to&#13;
pay for improvements, and reach agreement on community-based O&amp;M where needed.&#13;
2.41  Workshop on Project Implementation: Government and the Bank have agreed&#13;
to include the five Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies as implementing agencies of&#13;
the project. The challenge is to set up an institutional arrangement that promotes this,&#13;
while keeping the risks of implementation problems to a minimum. A participatory&#13;
process for formulating the implementation structure was initiated in January, 1995.&#13;
First, a brief paper outlining options for implementation arrangements was prepared and&#13;
circulated to officials of the five MAs and other concerned agencies. Second, a workshop&#13;
to discuss the requirements and proposed arrangements for project implementation was&#13;
held in April, 1995. Chief Executives and staff of the five MAs and representatives of&#13;
MLGRD, MF, TSC, and the World Bank participated. The workshop dealt with issues&#13;
such as the number and sizes of components for which the MAs could be responsible, the&#13;
staffing requirements for the MAs to assume implementation responsibilities, and the&#13;
financial flow and accounting arrangements. The main recommendation of the&#13;
workshop, which has been incorporated into the project, was to form "core teams" in each&#13;
MA composed of existing staff and contract staff to handle project implementation.&#13;
2.42 Further Activities: During the appraisal mission a workshop on solid waste&#13;
collection through the private sector was held with local government officials and staff.&#13;
It examined local practices, national policy questions, and the experience in Ghana with&#13;
private contracting of waste collection. A model contract was reviewed and discussed.&#13;
The workshop laid a foundation for developing detailed legal and financial arrangements&#13;
for the solid waste component of the project. During the period leading up to&#13;
effectiveness, seminars are lanned dealing with procurement and other implementation&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
2.43  As of December 1995, about 80 percent of a US$1.16 million Project Preparation&#13;
Facility had been committed for various preparatory studies. Preliminary design and&#13;
local consultation for community infrastructure upgrading and drainage in Kumasi has&#13;
been completed. Contracts for the preparation of detailed studies and bid documents for&#13;
community upgrading and Kumasi drainage are expected to be signed in March 1996. A&#13;
team of international and national consultants is carrying out preliminary designs and&#13;
environmental studies for storm drainage works in Accra and Sekondi Takoradi. This&#13;
phase is expected to conclude by the end of February 1996, after which detailed designs&#13;
would be prepared. Another international/national consulting group is nearing&#13;
completion of preliminary designs and environmental studies of sanitary landfill/septage&#13;
treatment facilities in Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale. National consultants&#13;
under separate contracts are finalizing Strategic Sanitation Plans and preliminary designs&#13;
for sanitation facilities in the five cities. A national consultant will be contracted in&#13;
March 1996 to help the MAs perform zoning studies for solid waste collection and start&#13;
pilot implementation of the household sanitation programs. The MAs of Kumasi,&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale have completed negotiations for acquisition of sites for&#13;
the sanitary landfills. Finalization of the legal acquisition is to await the confirmation of&#13;
the suitability of the sites by the design/environmental consultants.&#13;
C.   PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
2.44  The project would be implemented over a six year period beginning around July&#13;
1996. The cost summary appears in Table 2. Detailed cost tables are in Annex 2. The&#13;
total project cost is estimated at US$89.3 million equivalent. The foreign exchange&#13;
component is about US$50.8 million equivalent (57 percent of the total). Physical&#13;
contingencies for civil works have been calculated at 10 percent. Price contingency&#13;
calculations are based on expressing all costs in US$ at July 1995 prices and applying a&#13;
cost escalation of 2.5 percent per year starting in FY97.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
2.45 A summary of the financing plan appears in Table 3. An IDA credit of US$71.0&#13;
million equivalent would finance approximately 80 percent of total project costs. This&#13;
credit would be extended on standard IDA terms for 40 years with 10 years of grace.&#13;
GOG would finance US$8.9 million equivalent, or 10 percent of total project costs. The&#13;
MAs and beneficiaries would finance about US$5.3 million, representing their shares of&#13;
community upgrading works, sanitation facilities, and solid waste collection. The MAs'&#13;
contribution is estimated to be about US$3.5 million, comprising a 10 percent share of&#13;
the upgrading programs in Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi and a 50 percent share&#13;
of the new privatized solid waste collection. Beneficiaries' contribution of US$1.9&#13;
million represents their 50 percent share of the household sanitation component. The&#13;
three Assemblies participating in community upgrading have passed resolutions&#13;
committing themselves to providing their 10 percent shares. At negotiations both GOG&#13;
and the MAs confirmed that they would provide their respective counterpart funds.&#13;
Initial deposit of counterpart funds in the main project account and the MAs' sub-project&#13;
accounts would be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;

2.46  Co-financing of about US$3.4 million equivalent has been tentatively secured&#13;
from the Nordic Development Fund. This would be applied to the project-wide capacity&#13;
building sub-component. In addition, it is expected that the Government of the&#13;
Netherlands, through the Netherlands Association of Municipalities, will contribute about&#13;
US$0.6 million toward a training program.&#13;
Cost Recovery&#13;
2.47  Until recently, charging fees for solid waste collection was not a public policy in&#13;
Ghana. This has changed. However, the ability of the MAs to collect user fees is limited&#13;
by their weak management capacity and the public's lack of confidence in their abilities to&#13;
deliver adequate services. Thus, the MAs will have to move into cost recovery gradually.&#13;
The project would assist the MAs and their contractors to establish and collect user fees&#13;
for public toilets, piped sewerage, septage removal, solid waste collection, and tipping at&#13;
waste disposal sites. Fees would be set to cover 100 percent of O&amp;M costs for the first&#13;
three of these; fees would cover an agreed share of O&amp;M for the last two. Fees would&#13;
also cover some portion of investment costs subject to demonstrated affordability and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
willingness to pay. Franchise contracts for public toilets in commercial areas would&#13;
stipulate fees sufficient to cover their full capital and recurrent costs. Connection fees&#13;
would be charged for water supply and piped sewerage to recover the investment costs of&#13;
these services. The cost of household latrine construction would be shared 50-50&#13;
between the project and beneficiaries. O&amp;M costs of services for which fees cannot be&#13;
charged (such as drainage) would be paid through general revenues of the MAs. The&#13;
Chief Executives of all five cities are fully supportive of this approach. The use of&#13;
general revenues to cover a part of the costs of sanitation services is justified by their&#13;
city-wide environmental and public health benefits.&#13;
2.48  Under the community upgrading component, user fees would be charged for water&#13;
supply, piped sewage, public toilets, refuse collection, and street lighting (the latter&#13;
through the electricity tariff). The same cost recovery policies described above would be&#13;
applied. The MAs have agreed to cover the O&amp;M costs of roads and storn drains&#13;
through increased property tax collections. During negotiations, the Government and the&#13;
MAs agreed to implement the above cost recovery policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.1   The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) would be&#13;
the lead sector Ministry for the project. MLGRD would head the Project Coordination&#13;
Committee which would include representatives of MWH, the five MAs, and EPA.&#13;
MLGRD's existing Local Government Support Unit (LGSU) would oversee the&#13;
implementation of the project. The project would finance two professional contract&#13;
positions to boost the capacity of the LGSU. These personnel would focus on the&#13;
formulation and implementation of environrnental sanitation policies, assist in&#13;
coordinating the capacity-building activities of the project, and participate in supervision&#13;
of implementation.&#13;
3.2   The Technical Services Centre (TSC), a unit of the Ministry of Works and&#13;
Housing, would assist MLGRD with monitoring, accounting, procurement, and contract&#13;
management. TSC has served as the implementing agency for several Bank-funded&#13;
projects, including two currently under implementation (Urban II and Local Government&#13;
Development). TSC originally was staffed entirely by civil servants, but recently it has&#13;
been developing a mixed staff from government and the private sector. It combines some&#13;
of the better features of a well-functioning public sector agency (a small staff that focuses&#13;
on managing contracts with private providers of most services) with those of a more&#13;
efficient private organization (use of privately contracted staff for better performnance and&#13;
flexibility). The professional staff of TSC, totaling 1 1, currently consists of two civil&#13;
engineers, two architects, one quantity surveyor, one planner, one procurement specialist,&#13;
and four accounting/administrative staff. At appraisal it was determined that TSC would&#13;
require three more professional contract staff to handle the additional workload imposed&#13;
by UESP. These positions and some logistical support are to be funded under the project.&#13;
3.3   MLGRD, assisted by TSC, would manage the implementation of the project's&#13;
larger and more complex components (storm drainage, landfills, project-wide capacity&#13;
building). To build capacity at the local government level, the Metropolitan and&#13;
Municipal Assemblies would implement a number of the small and medium sized&#13;
components (e.g., community upgrading and on-site sanitation). The MAs would sign&#13;
contracts for the components under their responsibility and would take the lead in&#13;
handling procurement, contract supervision, and financial management for their&#13;
components. TSC would help train the MAs to perform these functions and would&#13;
support them during the initial "learning period" of actual implementation. All the MAs&#13;
have Technical Departments which would be strengthened. Accra and Kumasi already&#13;
have Waste Management Departments (WMDs), and the other three cities have smaller&#13;
waste units which would be upgraded.&#13;
3.4   Each MA would be required to put in place a core team of five or six persons&#13;
consisting of engineers, technicians, accountants, and support staff. The project would&#13;
finance three contract staff positions for each city to bolster the capacity of the core&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
teams. At negotiations, the Government and the MAs agreed to fill the three contract&#13;
staff positions with qualified persons. The other members would be drawn from the&#13;
MAs' existing staffs. In most cases the MAs will provide an engineer, a technician, and a&#13;
bookkeeper. The MAs would be required to have all contract staff in place as a condition&#13;
of effectiveness,&#13;
3.5   The allocation of implementation responsibilities between central government&#13;
(MLGRD assisted by TSC) and the Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Central Government:&#13;
Civil Worka&#13;
Storm Drainage&#13;
Sanitary Landfills/Septage Treatment Facilities&#13;
Large-Scale Piped Sewage&#13;
Procurement of Vehicles and Equipment&#13;
Heavy Equipment for Waste Disposal&#13;
Vehicles and Equipment for Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Consultancy Services&#13;
Design and Supervision of Works&#13;
Project-Wide Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies:&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
Community Infrastructure Upgrading&#13;
(roads, footpaths, drains, sanitation, solid waste collection, street&#13;
lighting)&#13;
Household Sanitation Facilities&#13;
Public and School Sanitation Facilities&#13;
Septage Treatment Facilities, Other Small Sanitation Facilities&#13;
Consultancy Services&#13;
Local-Level Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
Local-Level Design and Supervision of Works&#13;
Operations&#13;
Solid Waste Collection (Private)&#13;
3.6   The relationship between MLGRD and TSC was formalized in a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding signed by the respective Ministers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.7   The obligations of the MAs under the project would be formalized through grant&#13;
agreements to be signed by the Ministry of Finance, MLGRD, and each of the MAs. The&#13;
agreements would cover the MAs' responsibilities to sign contracts, provide counterpart&#13;
funding from their own resources, allocate funds for O&amp;M, establish Waste Management&#13;
Departments, provide adequate staff, perform financial accounting and reporting, and&#13;
comply with procurement and audit requirements. The content and form of the&#13;
agreements were agreed at negotiations. The signing of the grant agreements would be a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.8   The World Bank's experience in Ghana with local contractors has been generally&#13;
good. There is a sufficient number of qualified contractors to handle the contracts under&#13;
the project, including civil works and the operation of sanitation services. Ghana has&#13;
numerous civil engineering companies which have a good track record of performance&#13;
under IDA-financed projects. Private firms also have been active in the sanitation sector.&#13;
The city of Tema, for example, has successfully managed contracts with several private&#13;
companies to collect solid waste in its planned residential areas for the past five years. In&#13;
1994, the city of Accra began a pilot solid waste collection contract with a private firm.&#13;
Private septage hauling companies have been in existence for some time, mainly&#13;
servicing non-government clients.&#13;
B.   OPERATIONAL PLANS AND MANUALS&#13;
3.9   A Project Implementation Schedule appears in Annex 4. This SAR contains most&#13;
of the other elements of the Project Implementation Plan: organizational arrangements for&#13;
implementation (see above), a disbursement schedule (Annex 5), risk factors (Chapter 4),&#13;
and monitoring and performance indicators (Annex 3). These elements plus two others--&#13;
a procurement schedule and an auditing timetable--would be put together to form the&#13;
complete Plan.&#13;
3.10  TSC would oversee the preparation of a Project Implementation Manual covering&#13;
procurement, contract management, financial record-keeping, and disbursements. IhX&#13;
Manual. which would also contain the Project Implementation Plan. satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
would be adopted prior to credit effectiveness for use by staff of MLGRD, TSC and the&#13;
MA&amp;&#13;
C.   REPORTING, MONITORING, AND REVIEW&#13;
3.11  In the period leading up to credit effectiveness, the existing computer-based&#13;
project progress reporting system used by TSC would be adapted and extended for use by&#13;
the five MAs. Staff of the MAs would be specially trained to operate the reporting&#13;
system. During negotiations, the MAs agreed to provide data on locally implemented&#13;
components within 14 days of the end of each quarter to TSC. TSC agreed to combine&#13;
this information with its own data on the centrally implemented components to produce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
consolidated quarterly progress reports. These would be submitted to the Project&#13;
Coordination Committee and IDA. The progress reports would cover the status of each&#13;
civil works contract, the status and timing of procurement steps for each contract,&#13;
implementation of technical assistance and training activities, funds committed against&#13;
funds budgeted by sub-project, funds disbursed by sub-project, the status of all bank&#13;
accounts, cost recovery for services, and general municipal finances. The progress&#13;
reports would also contain action plans for each component for the coming 12 months,&#13;
updated each quarter.&#13;
3.12  Special monitoring mechanisms would be put in place to assess the effectiveness&#13;
and efficiency of (a) solid waste collection, (b) solid waste disposal, (c) the operation of&#13;
the household, neighborhood, and school sanitation programs, and (d) the operation of&#13;
treatment facilities. Monitoring and performance indicators for the project are shown in&#13;
Annex 3.&#13;
3.13 During negotiations, the Government agreed that the mid-term review of the&#13;
project would occur by September, 1999. This would be a joint exercise of the&#13;
Government, the MAs, and IDA designed both as an assessment of past experience and a&#13;
forward-looking analysis of any changes or remedial actions that may be needed to&#13;
achieve the project's objectives. The mid-term review would cover the project's&#13;
components, implementation arrangements, and financing mechanisms, including&#13;
specifically (a) the progress of physical implementation of infrastructure improvements,&#13;
(b) the timeliness and efficiency of procurement of works, goods, and consultancy&#13;
services, (c) the effectiveness and impact of technical assistance and training at the&#13;
central and local levels, (d) the operation and maintenance components, especially the&#13;
privatized solid waste collection, (e) the extent to which the MAs have maintained&#13;
adequate staffing for the project, and (f) performance of the Government and MAs in&#13;
making counterpart funds available. In addition to the mid-term review, annual joint&#13;
implementation reviews would be carried out based on the monitoring and performance&#13;
indicaos&#13;
D.   PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.14  A procurement schedule for key contracts, showing the major milestones, appears&#13;
in Annex 13. A more detailed procurement schedule would be prepared as part of the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (see para. 3.9) to be completed prior to credit effectiveness.&#13;
The capability of the implementing agencies is discussed in Section A above (see&#13;
especially para. 3.2). An agreement is in place with the Government of Ghana (dated&#13;
June 1993) regarding time limits for procurement processing for civil works and goods.&#13;
Table 4 summarizes the project components, their estimated costs, and proposed methods&#13;
of procurement. At negotiations, agreement was reached on limits to procurement&#13;
processing time for the various categories of procurement.&#13;

Civil Works&#13;
3.15  The main civil works components of the project would be (a) primary and&#13;
secondary drainage, (b) solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and (c) community&#13;
infrastructure upgrading. The storm drainage works for Accra and Kumasi and the solid&#13;
waste disposal facilities for Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale are likely to be&#13;
attractive to foreign bidders and would be tendered through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures. These have an estimated total value of about US$43 million&#13;
equivalent. The drainage works for Accra (about US$21 m.) would be divided in two&#13;
packages: one for the Odaw primary drain and one for secondary drains. The Kumasi&#13;
drainage works (about US$10 m.) would be packaged in one contract. There would&#13;
probably be three contracts (one per city) for the solid waste facilities (about US$12 m.&#13;
total). Eligible domestic contractors bidding for civil works under ICB would receive a&#13;
7.5 percent margin of preference in bid evaluation in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
the IDA Procurement Guidelines of January 1995.&#13;
3.16 The community infrastructure upgrading subprojects for Accra, Kumasi, and&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi, totaling about US$14 million, would be tendered through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) under procedures acceptable to IDA. Because of the number&#13;
of contracts, the type of work, and the location (in dense, lower-income communities), it&#13;
is unlikely that these works would be attractive to foreign contractors (though they would&#13;
not be precluded from bidding). Septage treatment facilities, sewerage rehabilitation&#13;
works, on-site sanitation facilities, and related works, whose value totals about US$6&#13;
million, also would be packaged into contracts suitable for NCB competition by local&#13;
firms. In the project as a whole, works estimated to cost up to US$2.0 million per&#13;
contract, up to an aggregate of US$16.2 million, would be procured through NCB&#13;
procedures. Experience from previous projects confirns that that there are a sufficient&#13;
number of competent local and locally-based foreign bidders to provide effective&#13;
competition for these types of works. International contractors, some of which are based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
in Ghana, would be eligible to bid for these works both individually and/or in joint&#13;
venture with local firns.&#13;
3.17  The household sanitation program (US$3.7 m.) would consist of many very small&#13;
contracts. These would be managed by a local consultant in each city working under the&#13;
MA's Waste Management Department. The consultants would select small community&#13;
contractors, through an acceptable procedure, who would submit proposals for small&#13;
packages of latrine works. Individual contracts would not exceed US$ 10,000. A detailed&#13;
explanation of the mechanism appears in Annex 8 (Sanitation Component). The&#13;
household sanitation program meets the criteria for "community participation in&#13;
procurement" under the World Bank guidelines, as it involves (a) the use of artisans from&#13;
the local communities and (b) the application of labor-intensive techniques and&#13;
beneficiary labor. The program is classified under "other" procurement in Table 4.&#13;
Goods&#13;
3.18 Goods financed under the project would include landfill equipment (bulldozers&#13;
and front loaders), light vehicles, computers, and miscellaneous equipment for&#13;
implementing agencies. The total value of goods is estimated at about US$3.2 million&#13;
equivalent. ICB procedures would be used for the heavy equipment, vehicles, and some&#13;
office equipment, for a total of about US$2.9 million. About $0.14 m. of equipment&#13;
would be financed through the Nordic Development Fund. National shopping and/or the&#13;
use of the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO) of UNDP may be used for&#13;
off-the-shelf individual items such as vehicles or computers for contracts not exceeding&#13;
US$50,000 each. The total value of goods procured through shopping would not exceed&#13;
US$500,000. All goods imported into Ghana would be subject to pre-shipment&#13;
inspection for quality, quantity, and customs duty verification (but not price verification&#13;
for goods procured under ICB).&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
3.19  Consultants financed by IDA, totaling about US$11 million equivalent, would be&#13;
contracted in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. The&#13;
consultancy services required under the project would be for preparation of designs,&#13;
environmental studies and bid documents, works supervision, project management, and&#13;
capacity-building. The procurement of consultants would be done using the World&#13;
Bank's Standard Letter of Invitation and Standard Consultant Contracts.&#13;
Bank Review&#13;
3.20 Prior review by IDA would be required for procurement of works which exceed&#13;
US$1 million equivalent; for procurement of goods which exceed US$200,000&#13;
equivalent; for procurement of services of consulting firms which exceed US$100,000&#13;
equivalent; and for procurement of services of individual consultants which exceed&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent. Prior review for consultant contracts would apply without&#13;
exception to single-source contracts or assignments of a critical nature. Prior review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
would cover approximately 70 percent of the total value of contracts financed by IDA.&#13;
All bidding documents for ICB will be based on the World Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents for each type of ICB procurement.&#13;
E.    DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.21  The project would be disbursed over a period of six years, from about July 1,&#13;
1996 to June 1, 2002. This is consistent with the standard disbursement profile for urban&#13;
projects in Ghana. Disbursements are expected to occur as planned because the&#13;
Technical Services Centre has had extensive involvement as an implementing agency for&#13;
Bank-financed projects. One of TSC's main tasks would be to assist the Metro and&#13;
Municipal Assemblies to manage their components of the project. A disbursement&#13;
schedule appears in Annex 5.&#13;
3.22  The IDA credit would be disbursed against the following categones:&#13;

3.23 During negotiations it was agreed that MLGRD and TSC would operate a project&#13;
account in Cedis which would carry the counterpart funding by the Government, and that&#13;
each MA would operate a Project Subaccount to be replenished quarterly from the Project&#13;
Account. To facilitate project implementation, Government would open a Special&#13;
Account in US dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized&#13;
allocation would amount to US$3.0 million and would cover four months of eligible&#13;
expenditures. Once the Special Account is opened, an amount of US$1.5 million,&#13;
representing 50 percent of the authorized allocation, would be deposited in it. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
remaining balance would be made available when needed. The Special Account would&#13;
be for payments below US$300,000 equivalent.&#13;
3.24  In order to facilitate payments to be made by the five participating MAs for small&#13;
contracts, each MA would open an Advance Account in US dollars at the branch of a&#13;
commercial bank, acceptable to IDA, preferably at the branch of the bank which carries&#13;
the Special Account. Once the initial deposit has been made into the Special Account, a&#13;
transfer would be made from the Special Account to the Advance Accounts of the&#13;
participating MAs amounting to US$200,000 for Accra, Kumasi, and Shama-Ahanta East&#13;
and US$ 100,000 for Tema and Tamale. MAs would replenish these Advance Accounts&#13;
monthly from the Special Account by submitting fully documented requests to TSC. The&#13;
latter will, in turn, replenish the Special Account monthly from the Credit Account. TSC&#13;
will provide guidance to the MAs on disbursements as needed and ensure that proper&#13;
accounting records are maintained by each MA.&#13;
3.25 Replenishment applications would be submitted monthly by TSC. The&#13;
applications would include details which clearly identify the amounts withdrawn for each&#13;
MA from the Special Account. All replenishment requests would be fully documented&#13;
except for: (a) contracts of less than: US$500,000 equivalent for civil works, US$200,000&#13;
equivalent for goods, US$ 100,000 equivalent for the services of consulting firms, and&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent for consulting services by individuals; and (b) operating costs&#13;
which may be claimed on the basis of the Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All&#13;
supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by TSC for review by periodic&#13;
Bank supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
F.   ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.26 TSC and the five Metropolitan or Municipal Assemblies would establish and&#13;
maintain project-related financial accounts for all components. At negotiations,&#13;
Government and the MAs agreed to the following financial record-keeping and auditing&#13;
requirements of the project, with accounts maintained in accordance with sound and&#13;
internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
Each of the five MAs would prepare annual statements of account and annual audit&#13;
reports covering the project components for which they are responsible. These reports&#13;
would be submitted not later than three months from the end of the financial year. TSC&#13;
would consolidate the MAs' financial and audit reports with its own annual financial&#13;
statements reflecting the financial performance and position of the project as a whole. An&#13;
independent auditor's opinion and report satisfactory to IDA on such statements would be&#13;
provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year. Special accounts and SOEs&#13;
would be included in the audit and specifically addressed in the audit report. The&#13;
auditor's report would also include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the&#13;
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a&#13;
basis for credit disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. The foregoing&#13;
accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and&#13;
timely information to IDA for supervision of the project.&#13;
&#13;

4. JUSTIFICATION, IMPACTS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    BENEFITS&#13;
Health, Productivity, and Well-Being&#13;
4.1   The project's improvements in drainage, sanitation, and waste management would&#13;
contribute to better health and thereby raise the productivity of urban residents, especially&#13;
the poor, in the five cities. The infant mortality rate in Ghana has dropped by about 25&#13;
percent in the past 20 years, but it still remains high at 79 per 1,000 live births. Diarrhea&#13;
is a major cause of death and disease, with around two to three episodes per child per&#13;
year. Intestinal worms also exact their toll, particularly among children, for whom ascaris&#13;
is an important contributor to malnutrition and hookworm an important factor in anemia.&#13;
Both diarrhea and worn infections directly affect a child's health status and his/her&#13;
susceptibility to other diseases. Malaria, responsible for some 800,000 deaths annually in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa, appears to be staging a resurgence in Ghana because the parasite is&#13;
developing a resistance to chloroquine and other anti-malarial drugs, and because its&#13;
normnally rural or coastal habitats are being spread by urbanization.&#13;
4.2   Poverty is the main predictor of urban morbidity and mortality. Water, sanitation,&#13;
food, shelter, hygiene, medical care, and education all play a part in determining&#13;
susceptibility to disease. It has been clearly established that the prevention of diarrhea,&#13;
the reduction in children's worm loads, and the elimination of habitat for mosquitoes and&#13;
other pests requires improved water supply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste collection,&#13;
and personal hygiene. However, the health benefits of infrastructure interventions&#13;
typically are not quantifiable due to the methodological problems of attributing outcomes&#13;
to various separate factors.&#13;
4.3   Sanitation: In Ghana's five major cities, about 40 percent of the population pay&#13;
to use public latrines that are unclean, inconvenient and lack privacy; 15 percent use&#13;
bucket latrines which have been banned because of the health hazard to conservancy&#13;
workers; 40 percent use household water closets that usually overflow to street drains;&#13;
and 5 percent use traditional or improved pit latrines. In addition, few schools have&#13;
operational sanitation facilities, and few children are taught or allowed to use public&#13;
facilities. At present, most of fecal waste generated in Ghana's urban centers is&#13;
discharged untreated into city streets and drains.&#13;
4.4   The sanitation component would provide about 5,500 household, 300 school and&#13;
65 public sanitation facilities in the five participating cities, from which some 400,000&#13;
people would benefit. While this represents only 15 to 20 percent of the total number of&#13;
potential beneficiaries, the project would also lay the foundation for reversing the trend in&#13;
environmental health degradation by establishing the public and private support&#13;
structures needed to construct and maintain these facilities on a large scale. In the case of&#13;
school facilities, physical works would be complemented with teacher training in the use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
of the facilities and practical ways to improve personal hygiene and encourage&#13;
environmental awareness among children. More generally, each of the cities would&#13;
benefit from a new septage treatment facility that would allow wastes from household&#13;
and public facilities to be properly disposed of rather than dumped into local street drains&#13;
and watercourses.&#13;
4.5   Solid Waste: Currently only about half of the solid waste generated within&#13;
Ghana's five largest cities is collected and disposed in dumps outside neighborhoods.&#13;
The project would support measures to improve the efficiency and coverage of solid&#13;
waste collection through private contracting, thereby removing a greater share of the&#13;
waste from neighborhoods, storm drains, and local watercourses. At appraisal it was too&#13;
early to make quantitative estimates of the impact of these interventions because studies&#13;
of collection zones and applicable technology were still ongoing. The project would also&#13;
finance new sanitary landfills in three cities, which would replace the existing, nearly&#13;
exhausted dump sites, provide environmentally safe disposal, and permit the elimination&#13;
of many neighborhood refuse dumps. These measures would eliminate breeding grounds&#13;
for pests (rats, flies and cockroaches) and focal points for excreta related diseases (as&#13;
many people, especially children, use local dump sites for defecation).&#13;
4.6   Drainage: The health dimensions of poor drainage range from nuisances such as&#13;
bad odors to serious problems like excreta-related diseases, malaria, schistosomiasis, and&#13;
filariasis. The project would finance major investments in primary and secondary&#13;
drainage in Accra and Kumasi. These would improve the functioning of tertiary drainage&#13;
networks in extensive, densely built up areas.&#13;
Flood Abatement&#13;
4.7   The project's primary and secondary storm drainage improvements (35 percent of&#13;
total project costs) aim to reduce the incidence and severity of flooding in dense, flood-&#13;
prone central city areas. Apart from their contributions to improved health, the drainage&#13;
works would generate other economic benefits in the form of (a) reduced damage to&#13;
properties, (b) increased industrial and commercial turnover, (c) reduced losses of&#13;
contents of structures, (d) reduced damage to infrastructure, and (e) fewer traffic&#13;
disruptions resulting in reduced time losses and lower vehicle operating costs. In Accra,&#13;
the project would have an immediate impact on some 1,300 properties housing at least&#13;
17,000 people which are flooded nearly every year. It would also benefit several&#13;
thousand other structures which are flooded within 5 to 10 year cycles. Moreover, it&#13;
would provide large benefits to 71 industrial properties that are flooded within a 15-year&#13;
period and 98 industries that would be affected by a major 50-year event. In Kumasi, the&#13;
project would directly benefit 1,290 shops and around 25,000 traders in the Central&#13;
Market and nearby areas which experience five year cycle floods.&#13;
4.8   Economic rates of return using the above types of benefits show that the drainage&#13;
investments would be amply justified. ERRs have been calculated for the Kumasi and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Accra drainage works. Results are summarized in Annex 6. The Kumasi estimates were&#13;
carried out in late 1995 as part of preliminary design work, with benefits quantified for&#13;
the first three categories mentioned above. The ERRs for Kumasi drainage are 48 percent&#13;
for the full improvement scheme and 36 percent for the prioritized improvement scheme&#13;
(which has somewhat lower capital costs, higher maintenance costs, and slightly lower&#13;
benefits). The net present values of these schemes using a 12 percent discount rate are&#13;
US$31.8 million and US$26.9 million respectively. The ERRs for Accra come from the&#13;
1991 drainage master plan studies, upon which the UESP investments are based (new&#13;
preliminary engineering studies are currently underway, and these will include an updated&#13;
economic analysis). The ERRs for Accra, using the first three benefits categories&#13;
mentioned above, are 43 percent for the Odaw channel enlargement and 32 percent for&#13;
the Priority I secondary drains. Net present values using a 10 percent discount rate are&#13;
Cedis 6.3 billion and Cedis 5.9 billion respectively (1991 values).&#13;
Cost Effectiveness&#13;
4.9    Cost effectiveness has been a major consideration in the choice of technologies&#13;
for the project. Of the US$8.7 million allocated for sanitation in the project, 79 percent&#13;
(US$6.9 m.) is devoted to household sanitation with VIP latrines and on-site sanitation&#13;
facilities in schools and commercial areas. VIP latrines, which cost US$20 to US$60 per&#13;
capita, are clearly the least-cost solution for medium-density areas. Simplified piped&#13;
sewerage in similar areas would cost at least twice as much. The financing of public&#13;
toilet facilities (using the VIP or aquaprivy system) in commercial areas is justified by the&#13;
eligibility criteria: only those facilities that can operate on a commercial basis (full cost&#13;
recovery) would be financed. The school facilities (also multi-unit VIPs) are justified by&#13;
the fact that most children tend not to use public facilities and lack access to a household&#13;
facility. For solid waste disposal, the selected technology is landfill, which is the lowest-&#13;
cost, environmentally acceptable method. Landfill costs roughly US$3-5 per metric ton,&#13;
compared with tidal land reclamation ($5-15/m.t.), composting ($5-20/m.t.), and&#13;
incineration ($40-60/m.t.). Composting is often thought to be financially viable, but&#13;
experience in Ghana and similar countries shows that it is not, due to insufficient&#13;
demand.&#13;
4.10   The assistance to be provided under the project for privatized solid waste&#13;
collection is expected to increase the efficiency of this service. No precise data are&#13;
available on the actual costs per ton of solid waste collection in Ghana's main cities.&#13;
However, the low efficiency of present services is evident in low utilization rates of&#13;
municipal collection equipment, overstaffing, and cumbersome procedures. Data from&#13;
other countries suggests that competition encourages the public sector to significantly&#13;
improve its efficiency and to lower costs. Monitoring systems will be introduced under&#13;
the project to quantify the performance of traditional public sector collection as compared&#13;
with private contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
Institutional Performance&#13;
4.11   Strengthening of the MAs' institutional and financial capacity to operate and&#13;
maintain facilities would prolong their useful life and save on repair and rehabilitation&#13;
costs. The project's support for improved local revenue mobilization, cost recovery&#13;
through user fees, and capacity building for financial management would provide more&#13;
resources for the provision of basic infrastructure and services and help reduce the MAs'&#13;
reliance on the central government budget. Greater local government self-reliance and&#13;
better financial management would establish a basis for multi-year planning and&#13;
budgeting, which would help to make the use of scarce resources more efficient.&#13;
B.    POVERTY IMPACT&#13;
4.12  The project's improvements in urban drainage, sanitation, and solid waste services&#13;
would benefit all income groups in the participating cities, which have a total population&#13;
of about 3.1 million. Because the urban poor in Ghana suffer disproportionately from ill&#13;
health, mortality, and low productivity caused by inadequate environmental sanitation,&#13;
systematic improvements in the provision of these services would provide substantial&#13;
benefits to the poor. About 30 percent of the project's total cost would cover components&#13;
that specifically target the poor (community infrastructure upgrading, low-cost sanitation)&#13;
or from which the poor are more likely to benefit than the overall population (solid waste&#13;
collection). The community upgrading component would directly benefit about 265,000&#13;
residents of predominantly low-income urban communities which have severe&#13;
deficiencies of basic infrastructure (see Chapter 1). A 1991 survey found that average&#13;
household income levels in the selected communities in Accra were about equal to or&#13;
only slightly above the 1992 "poverty line" for Ghana as a whole. The sanitation&#13;
component would provide better services (new household latrines, new and improved&#13;
public toilets) to around 400,000 additional lower-income urban dwellers.&#13;
C.   ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
4.13 Following consultations with the Regional Environmental Division (AFTES), the&#13;
project was assigned a "B" environmental category. In general the project would improve&#13;
environmental conditions in urban areas by providing for safer removal, treatment, and&#13;
disposal of liquid and solid wastes. The main environmental issues involve protection of&#13;
ground and surface water from contamination by sewage, septage, and refuse leachate.&#13;
Environmental impact assessments are being carried out as part of the design of the&#13;
drainage works, sanitary landfills, and liquid waste treatment facilities. Treatment and&#13;
disposal facilities as well as any drainage outfalls would incorporate design features for&#13;
mitigating risks to ground and surface waters. Local residents have been or are being&#13;
consulted regarding site selection. Sites are located away from built-up urban areas.&#13;
Topographic and geophysical studies are being done to confirm the environmental&#13;
suitability of the sites. The preliminary design studies for primary drainage and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
community upgrading include assessments of any relocation that may be needed.&#13;
Relocation can largely be avoided by seeking drainage and road alignments that do not&#13;
displace people. If any relocation is needed, it is expected to be small. World Bank&#13;
guidelines on participation and compensation would be followed.&#13;
D.   RISKS&#13;
4.14  Project implementatiQoncould be delayed by the weak capacity of the&#13;
Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies. Sanitation, refuse and drainage are most&#13;
efficiently managed at the local government level. Thus, the incorporation of the MAs as&#13;
implementing agencies is an essential objective, in order to build their capacity to assume&#13;
responsibility for these services. Under Ghana's emerging sanitation and waste&#13;
management policies (see Letter of Sector Policy, Annex 1), the MAs would increasingly&#13;
manage the work of private contractors who are to be responsible for the direct provision&#13;
of most infrastructure and services. This means that the MAs would be moving toward&#13;
smaller, more professional staffs compatible with a focus on planning, coordination, and&#13;
supervisory functions. The project would attempt to minimize the risks associated with&#13;
the MAs' weak capacity by (a) limiting the numbers and sizes of components that each&#13;
MA would manage, (b) requiring each MA to have a basic core staff assigned to the&#13;
project, (c) providing support for the hiring of contractors to help with technical and&#13;
financial tasks, (d) ensuring that the central implementing agency supervises and&#13;
monitors the MAs adequately, and (e) providing substantial training to the MAs' officials&#13;
and staff. An implementation delay of one or two years would not jeopardize the benefits&#13;
of the investments.&#13;
4.15  There is a risk that counterpart fund may not be available as required, either from&#13;
the central government or the MAs. While this has not been a serious problem in past&#13;
IDA-supported urban projects, it continues to be a general issue for the IDA portfolio. It&#13;
would be addressed by keeping the required counterpart fund contribution modest (10&#13;
percent for the GOG and 3.9 percent for the MAs as a group). The GOG and MAs'&#13;
combined contribution would reach a maximum of US$ 3 to 4 million per year during the&#13;
three peak years of project implementation. This represents only about 1.3 to 1.8 percent&#13;
of the national 1996 development budget.&#13;
4.16  The project's impact could be reduced if cost recovery and general local revenue&#13;
mobilization are not implemented effectively, resulting in inadequate funding of&#13;
operation and maintenance. Household, school, and public sanitation facilities pose a low&#13;
risk, as these will be provided on a demand basis and will depend largely on direct user&#13;
maintenance (except public facilities which will be operated on franchise). Drainage also&#13;
has a low risk of maintenance failure. Sensitivity analysis (see Annex 6) indicates that&#13;
primary and secondary drainage would provide high economic benefits even if&#13;
maintenance is well below the optimum. This probably applies also to the sanitary&#13;
landfill facilities, whose ideal O&amp;M costs are considerable. The septage treatment&#13;
facilities would be simple, modest-sized stabilization ponds with O&amp;M costs are&#13;
relatively small and easily absorbed by the cities' budgets. The risk of inadequate O&amp;M&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
funding is being addressed through (a) a credit covenant requiring the MAs to allocate&#13;
O&amp;M funds to separate program budget lines for waste management and drainage, (b) an&#13;
intensive effort to build ownership of the project on the part of the Metropolitan and&#13;
Municipal Assemblies during preparation and up to effectiveness, and (c) the provision of&#13;
a considerable amount of capacity-building relating to O&amp;M during implementation.&#13;
&#13;

C.   CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS&#13;
5.13 Government would adopt the Project Implementation Manual (para. 3.10).&#13;
5. 14 MF, MLGRD and each of the MAs would have executed the grant agreements&#13;
referred to in para. 5.3 above (para. 3.7).&#13;
5.15  Government would issue a directive satisfactory to IDA requiring the MAs to&#13;
establish separate budget lines for waste management operations, including solid waste&#13;
collection and disposal and liquid waste management, and for the maintenance of storm&#13;
drains (para. 2.36).&#13;
5.16 Government would make an initial deposit of counterpart funds into the main&#13;
project account and into each of the five MAs' sub-project accounts (para. 2.45).&#13;
5.17 Govermnent would have caused each of the MAs to have hired persons acceptable&#13;
to IDA to fill the Project Coordinator, Project Sanitary Engineer, and Project Accountant&#13;
positions (para. 3.4).&#13;
D.   CONDITION OF DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.18 No disbursements of funds from the credit would be made for civil works for any&#13;
solid waste disposal or septage treatment facility in each city unless Govermnent provides&#13;
documentation showing that land for the facility in the city has been acquired in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.18).&#13;
E.   RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.19  With the above agreements and actions, the proposed project would be suitable&#13;
for an IDA credit of SDR 47.8 million (US$ 71.0 million equivalent) to the Republic of&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development&#13;
Letter of Sector Policy&#13;
January 18, 1996&#13;
The Director&#13;
West Central Africa Department&#13;
World Bank&#13;
Washington, DC U.S.A.&#13;
Environmental sanitation is an essential component of the health, productivity,&#13;
and welfare of the Ghanaian population. Inadequate drainage, solid waste management,&#13;
and disposal of liquid wastes interact to cause major problems, especially in urban&#13;
centers. The Government's ten year (1991-2000) National Environmental Action Plan&#13;
(NEAP) highlights sanitation and waste disposal as major issues. The NEAP calls for the&#13;
implementation of urban waste management and sanitation projects as a top priority; the&#13;
improvement of urban drainage in coastal cities; and the establishment and&#13;
implementation of environmental and health standards. However, environmental&#13;
sanitation has been treated as a relatively low priority in the allocation of national&#13;
development resources.&#13;
The Government of Ghana is taking steps to change this. One is the preparation&#13;
of an Environmental Sanitation Policy (ESP), drafted earlier this year by the Ministry of&#13;
Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD). The draft ESP is now being&#13;
reviewed by other government bodies. Another initiative is the preparation of an Urban&#13;
Environmental Sanitation Project (UESP), to be financed in part by the World Bank,&#13;
which is expected to commence in 1996.&#13;
The ESP provides the framework for accelerated development of the&#13;
environmental sanitation subsector. The national goal of the policy is the development&#13;
and maintenance of a sound and sanitary environment in all communities in order to&#13;
promote the social and economic well-being of the population. The objectives that will&#13;
lead toward this goal are:&#13;
a) Recognition of the environmental sanitation sub-sector as one of the&#13;
categories of the national development program.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 4&#13;
b) Establishment of adequate institutional structures at all levels to deal with the&#13;
various aspects of environmental sanitation.&#13;
c) Strengthening and promoting the involvement of the private sector in the&#13;
delivery of environmental sanitation services.&#13;
d) Promoting the use of cost-effective, appropriate, affordable, and&#13;
environmentally friendly technologies for addressing environmental sanitation&#13;
problems.&#13;
e) Adoption of the cost recovery principle in the planning and management of&#13;
sanitation services.&#13;
f) Development of human resource capabilities to manage environmental&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
Environmental sanitation comprises storm drainage, waste collection and disposal&#13;
(including solid waste, sewage and septage, industrial wastes, and clinical wastes),&#13;
cleaning of public areas, pest control, food hygiene, hygiene education, and related&#13;
programs. The provision of environmental sanitation services is a legal responsibility of&#13;
the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies. The Government will assist the&#13;
Assemblies in preparing sanitation plans for their areas. "Strategic sanitation plans"&#13;
dealing with sewage and septage already have been prepared for the five cities covered by&#13;
the UESP.&#13;
Assemblies will be encouraged to use a variety of technologies adapted to&#13;
different types of housing, commercial, or industrial facilities, densities, soil conditions,&#13;
user preferences and affordability. The intent is to move away from the use of&#13;
conventional solutions only, and to employ a range of proven technologies that address&#13;
the needs of all segments of the population. For example, options for household&#13;
sanitation include VIP latrines, septic tanks, simplified sewers, and conventional sewers.&#13;
Options for solid waste collection include communal "skip" containers, arm-roll&#13;
containers, compactor trucks, modified tippers, and small tractor-trailers for pre-&#13;
collection.&#13;
It is essential to mobilize the private sector in order to augment the resources&#13;
(financial, material and managerial) applied to environmental sanitation and to improve&#13;
the efficiency and sustainability of services. Private contractors have for some time been&#13;
hauling septage and have recently begun collecting solid waste in Accra and Tema. The&#13;
UESP will assist in improving and expanding these types of arrangements. The&#13;
Government's policy will be to facilitate the participation of private enterprises in&#13;
activities such as the management of sanitation facilities (through lease or franchise&#13;
contracts), the collection of septage (through private pumping truck services), the&#13;
maintenance of city-owned waste collection trucks, and the cleaning and maintenance of&#13;
drains.&#13;

Some services and facilities--including house-to-house waste collection and&#13;
public toilets in market areas--can be operated on a commercial basis, whether by the&#13;
public or private sectors. The policy will be to promote full cost recovery of such&#13;
services through user charges. Other services--such as communal waste collection or&#13;
piped sewerage--for which a willingness to pay exists, but not enough for full&#13;
commercialization, will be offered with user charges that cover at least the recurrent&#13;
costs, and if possible a portion of the capital costs. For those services that are public&#13;
goods--e.g. drainage--cost recovery will be through gerieral taxes and fees levied by the&#13;
Assemblies. As public funds are limited, the general policy will be to target subsidies as&#13;
much as possible to the lower-income segments of the population.&#13;
National standards and regulations for environmental sanitation shall be issued by&#13;
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Assemblies, in the performance of&#13;
their functions, shall be guided by the EPA's norms. The Assemblies shall promulgate&#13;
their own by-laws as needed.&#13;
The present institutional capacity for setting policies, planning, monitoring, and&#13;
providing services in environmental sanitation is inadequate. Capacity-building will be&#13;
needed among the following:&#13;
a) The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, as the lead&#13;
Ministry for the sub-sector. MLGRD's Human Settlement and Environmental&#13;
Division will coordinate the provision of policy guidance and technical&#13;
assistance to local governments.&#13;
b) A national coordinating body for environmental sanitation policy, representing&#13;
allied government institutions, non-governmental organizations, and private&#13;
sector groups. Allied government institutions are the Ministries of&#13;
Environment, Science, and Technology (and its agencies); Works and&#13;
Housing; Roads and Highways; Education; and Health.&#13;
c) Waste Management Departments to be established in the Metropolitan and&#13;
Municipal Assemblies and Environmental Sanitation Departments to be&#13;
established in the District Assemblies. These will be responsible for local&#13;
planning, management, regulation, and provision of services--directly or&#13;
indirectly through private contractors.&#13;
d) Private enterprises and non-governmental organizations involved in the&#13;
provision of environmental sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;

In Accra, waste management services have been consolidated&#13;
under one Waste Management Department (WMD) to enable full&#13;
accountability for service performance and cost.   The UESP wi 11&#13;
assist  in  the  establishment  of  similarly  accountable  WMDs  in&#13;
Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema and Tamale. The adoption of this&#13;
institutional model in the five main cities involves the adoption&#13;
of by-laws enabling the WMD to generate revenues through direct&#13;
user charges, to retain and manage these revenues for the provision&#13;
of services, to directly pay the salaries of its staff and to&#13;
privatise selected aspects of its services.&#13;
Waste management services are severely underfunded at the&#13;
local government  level.   In many cases.  capital  investments  in&#13;
civil  works  and  equipment  have  outpaced  the  ability  of  the&#13;
Assemblies  to  cover  operation  and  mainrenance  costs.    The&#13;
Assemblies shall be encouraged to set aside increasing amounts&#13;
to meet the recurrent costs of waste management services and for&#13;
the upkeep of  facilities and equipment.   To help promote  such&#13;
sustainability,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Rural&#13;
Development will require each of the five Assemblies participating&#13;
in the UESP to create a separate budget line for waste management&#13;
operations, including solid waste collection and disposal. liquid&#13;
waste management, and cleaning of storm drains.&#13;

*Figures from 1991 Accra Drainage Master Plan. New updating studies are underway to be completed&#13;
by March 1996.&#13;
Main Assumptions&#13;
Discount rate = Kumasi 12 percent (1995). At the time the Accra study was done in&#13;
1991, the norm was 10 percent. However, the updated study now&#13;
underway (to be completed in March 1996) will use the current standard&#13;
12 percent). The variation between the discount rates is slight and does&#13;
not alter the thrust of the findings of economic viability.&#13;
Real exchange rate constant.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
Kumasi:      Assume both a decrease of benefits by 20 percent and an increase of costs&#13;
by 20 percent. ERR then becomes 33.6 percent for Recommended&#13;
Scheme and 24.4 percent for Prioritized Scheme.&#13;
Accra:       Sensitivity analysis not performed in 1991 study but will be done in 1996&#13;
updated study.&#13;
Switching Values&#13;
Kumasi:      For NPV to become negative benefits would have to decrease by 74&#13;
percent (Recommended Scheme) or 75 percent (Prioritized Scheme).&#13;
Accra:       Switching values not calculated in 1991 study but will be done in 1996&#13;
updated study.&#13;

Nature of Benefits&#13;
Avoidance of building fabric damage: Surveys were carried out to inventory structures&#13;
within the project areas (industry, trade, and residential). Assessments of the ratable&#13;
values of the structures were carried out. These were based on construction costs for&#13;
various categories of properties and calculated on floor areas (m2). Damage estimates&#13;
were based on the depth of flooding that properties are subjected to. Tables of depth-&#13;
flood damage potential relationships were developed. Based on the water surface profile&#13;
that would result from an expected 15 year flood, the expected mean flood depth over the&#13;
flood-prone areas and the corresponding damage were estimated with the aid of&#13;
topographical maps. Considering the 15-year flood occurrence, estimated damages were&#13;
spread evenly over the amortization period.&#13;
Avoidance of contents damage: This was based on estimates of the value of equipment,&#13;
materials, and commodities and their elevations in the structures. Sample surveys&#13;
determined the types, quantities and values of contents affected. Usually there is little&#13;
chance of salvaging contents before floods occur, so losses tend to be considerable&#13;
especially in wholesale establishments. Depth distributions of flood damage potential&#13;
related to structure content were combined with survey data. The percentage of potential&#13;
damage was estimated for each content category. For Accra, residential contents damage&#13;
was also estimated based on house inventory valuations drawn up with the aid of the&#13;
State Insurance Company and other sources.&#13;
Avoidance of sales losses: A huge variety of trade activities occur in the affected areas,&#13;
including foodstuffs, leatherware, glassware, metal products, clothing, and building&#13;
materials. A large amount of porterage and motorized transport services are carried out in&#13;
support of these sales. Losses are mainly the result of the suspension of trading activities&#13;
during floods and during the ensuing clean-up periods. Sample surveys of traders of all&#13;
categories was carried out to estimate daily sales volumes. This information was&#13;
combined with flood incidence data to estimate the annual losses. These were computed&#13;
on the basis of estimated net profits.&#13;
The value of potential flood damage is expected to increase each year due to new&#13;
construction and real expansion of economic activity. Benefits were thus assumed to&#13;
grow by three percent per year, commensurate with expected economic growth.&#13;
The above benefits alone produce the high ERRs reported in the table. Major non-&#13;
quantified benefits are: (a) reduced deaths and illnesses from elimination of standing&#13;
water, (b) reduced damage to infrastructure, (c) lower costs associated with traffic&#13;
disruptions, and (d) indirect or multiplier costs (e.g. extra economic costs due to utility&#13;
disruptions).&#13;
Main Beneficiaries&#13;
Industrial enterprises (large and small), wholesale and retail enterprises, small-scale&#13;
traders, and residents of flood-prone areas.&#13;

URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Drainage Component&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The objectives of the component are (a) to improve priority primary and&#13;
secondary drainage systems serving the central business areas of Accra, Kumasi, and&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi which suffer regular inundation and (b) to establish construction and&#13;
maintenance responsibilities for drainage along with practices and programs to ensure the&#13;
sustainability of drainage investments.&#13;
DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.    The component will include the following:&#13;
a) Dredging and lining approximately 7 km. of Accra's primary drainage&#13;
channel, the Odaw River, to alleviate flooding of major commercial and&#13;
residential areas and construction of up to 20 km. of highest priority&#13;
secondary drains.&#13;
b) Dredging and lining approximately 7.6 km. of Kumasi's primary drainage&#13;
system, the Nsuben River, and selected secondary and tertiary drains which&#13;
serve the city's central commercial, market, and transportation node (lorry&#13;
park and railway station).&#13;
c) Rehabilitating parts of the drainage system serving the Market Circle in&#13;
Takoradi to relieve bottlenecks and alleviate flooding.&#13;
d) Strengthening the ability of the respective Metropolitan Assemblies to&#13;
maintain drainage infrastructure through the establishment of budget lines for&#13;
drain maintenance and implementation of maintenance plans.&#13;
3.    The sub-projects to be financed were identified from Drainage Master Plan&#13;
studies carried out with World Bank assistance in 1990-91 in both Accra and Kumasi.&#13;
The proposed investments represent the highest priority interventions proposed in each of&#13;
the studies based on benefit/cost ratios, populations served, and drainage capacity ratios.&#13;
4.    For Accra and Takoradi, consultants are preparing preliminary engineering which,&#13;
after review, will be followed by detailed engineering and preparation of bid documents.&#13;
Preliminary engineering is already complete for the Kumasi program, and consultants&#13;
have commenced detailed engineering. Bid documents for drainage in Kumasi are&#13;
scheduled for completion prior to scheduled credit effectiveness (July 1996).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57                               Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.    Based on the Master Plan study in Accra, the Odaw River will be dredged as a&#13;
trapezoidal channel. The top width will range from 65 m. at its outfall in the Korle&#13;
Lagoon to 45 m. at its upper reach near the Accra-Tema motorway, approximately 7.2&#13;
km. from the outfall. Depths range from 5 to 7 m. This was one of three options for&#13;
improvement of the Odaw River that were studied by the Master Plan consultants and is&#13;
the only option that would prevent flooding adjacent to the river. The channel would&#13;
have sufficient capacity to contain a 50 year design flood. With freeboard the channel&#13;
could also convey a 100 year event without flooding. The secondary drainage systems in&#13;
various locations within the city will be improved by desilting, realigning, and lining&#13;
with in-situ mass concrete sections and/or precast reinforced concrete U-sections or pipes.&#13;
6.   In Kumasi the upper length of the Nsuben River (0.5 km in length ) and major&#13;
secondary drains feeding it will be buried in concrete lined rectangular sections. The&#13;
primary drain will range in size from 2 to 2.5 m., and the secondary channels from 1.5 to&#13;
3.25 m. The middle section, of 2.5 km. length, will also be lined with in-situ concrete as&#13;
a rectangular section of 6-8 m. top width and 2.8 m. depth. The downstream section, of&#13;
4.6 km. length where development is much less dense, will be dredged and left as a&#13;
trapezoidal earth channel ranging in size from 6 to 12 m. wide and 2.5 to 2.65 m. deep.&#13;
This channel will also be lined with stone pitching in certain stretches to improve&#13;
hydraulic properties of the channel and reduce scour.&#13;
7.    A number of market stalls in Kumasi which are occupied during trading hours&#13;
would need to be temporarily relocated to permit construction. These would be restored&#13;
to their original locations. In addition, 15 shops in the railway area adjacent to the&#13;
Central Market would be permanently relocated. GOG and the KMA are following the&#13;
Bank's guidelines on relocation. A schedule of all properties affected by the works either&#13;
temporarily or permanently has been compiled. Alternative sites have been identified for&#13;
temporary stalls whilst works are carried out and also for the 15 shops to be relocated.&#13;
Shopkeepers are being fully consulted. Compensation will be assessed and paid. The 15&#13;
shops will be provided with new facilities at a mutually agreed location which will&#13;
provide equivalent or better incomes. Details of compensation, relocation logistics, and&#13;
development of the new shop site are being incorporated in a resettlement plan being&#13;
prepared by the consultants carrying out detailed engineering. This plan is to be&#13;
submitted and reviewed prior to negotiations&#13;
COSTS&#13;
8.    The base cost of the drainage component (excluding design and supervision and&#13;
physical and price contingencies) is estimated at an overall total of US$ 25.6 million.&#13;
This is made up of US$17.0 million in Accra, US$8.1 million in Kumasi and US$0.5&#13;
million in Takoradi. Table I summarizes program details and costs in the respective&#13;
cities.&#13;
&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
9.    Historically, responsibilities for drainage have been unclear and divided between&#13;
Roads Authorities, AESC Hydro, and respective local governments, each of which has a&#13;
different parent Ministry. Consequently attention to, and investment for, capital&#13;
improvements, rehabilitation, and maintenance have been inadequate. Local government&#13;
legislation points to drainage being the responsibility of local government (i.e.,&#13;
Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies). However, Assemblies lack the&#13;
technical capability to design and the funds to construct large-scale drainage works. The&#13;
component in the UESP will thus be implemented (and funded) by central government.&#13;
10.   The Technical Services Centre (TSC) of the Ministry of Works and Housing&#13;
(MWH) will have responsibility for procurement and administration of contracts for&#13;
drainage on behalf of the MLGRD. The bid documents will be prepared by consulting&#13;
engineers already engaged and funded through a PPF, and capital works will be carried&#13;
out by experienced civil works contractors who will enter into contracts with TSC.&#13;
Consultants will be engaged through the project for construction supervision.&#13;
MAINTENANCE&#13;
11.   Responsibilities for drainage maintenance have historically been unclear, and this&#13;
has contributed to inadequate budget allocations for drainage maintenance. Whereas&#13;
Assemblies are legally responsible for drainage, the reality is that they have neither the&#13;
expertise nor resources to carry out adequate levels of routine and periodic maintenance&#13;
for primary, secondary and tertiary drains. For the foreseeable future, the central&#13;
government will have to shoulder a considerable part of this responsibility. Communities&#13;
themselves, through locally based organizations, could assist in the routine maintenance&#13;
(cleaning and desilting) of tertiary drains. Priority drainage maintenance activities of&#13;
Assemblies should focus on secondary drainage systems. So that in future drainage&#13;
provision and maintenance responsibilities are rationalized and scarce funds targeted on&#13;
the most important drainage maintenance activities, the project would support a study&#13;
which would address these issues and make recommendations as to a more effective way&#13;
forward in the future.&#13;
12.  In the short term, the project will promote the gradual assumption of more&#13;
systematic responsibility for drain maintenance by the Assemblies by (a) providing&#13;
technical assistance for the preparation of drain maintenance plans and (b) requiring each&#13;
Assembly to allocate funds annually in a separate budget line for drain maintenance.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Sanitation Component&#13;
SANITATION PLANNING&#13;
1.   In Ghana's five major cities about 40 percent of the population pay to use public&#13;
latrines that are filthy, inconvenient and lack privacy; 15 percent use pan latrines which&#13;
have been banned because of the health hazard to conservancy workers; 40 percent use&#13;
household water closets that usually overflow to street drains; and 5 percent use&#13;
traditional or improved pit latrines. In addition, few schools have operational sanitation&#13;
facilities. At present, hardly any of the fecal waste generated in the MAs is properly&#13;
treated before disposal. Septic tank overflows, septage removed from household and&#13;
public facilities, industrial effluent from factories, leachate from sawmills and waste oil&#13;
from vehicle repair areas end up in local drains and vacant lots. As a result storm water&#13;
drainage systems have become open sewers. With rapid urbanization, the already poor&#13;
sanitation conditions will worsen if no urgent and effective actions are taken.&#13;
2.    To begin addressing these problems, the cities participating in the UESP have&#13;
prepared Strategic Sanitation Plans (SSPs) that set out their strategy for providing&#13;
comprehensive sanitation services by the year 2005. The SSPs include a priority listing&#13;
of the mix of household, public and school facilities needed to serve each city's low&#13;
income households and a description of the management and financing arrangements&#13;
needed to implement each component.&#13;
3.    The plans differ from traditional master plans in that they (i) tailor recommended&#13;
technical options to each type of housing or neighborhood in the city, (ii) consider user&#13;
preferences and willingness to pay, (iii) use a relatively short planning horizon (10-15&#13;
years) emphasizing high priority actions, and (iv) break the overall plan into projects that&#13;
can be implemented independently but which together provide full coverage. The intent&#13;
is to move away from a focus on conventional sewerage alone, and to consider a range of&#13;
proven technologies which address the needs of all segments of the urban population,&#13;
recognizing resource constraints and paying due attention to willingness and capacity of&#13;
users to pay for improved services.&#13;
4.    To address the MAs' immediate problems, the SSPs call for (i) elimination of pan&#13;
latrines and a move from public facilities to household sanitation facilities, (ii) improved&#13;
public facilities in neighborhoods and commercial centers, (iii) improved school&#13;
facilities, and (iv) new septage treatment facilities. The MAs would help pay the costs of&#13;
sewers and household latrines in low-income neighborhoods if the beneficiaries pay the&#13;
full cost of operation and maintenance. The MAs would also finance the rehabilitation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61                              Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
public facilities in neighborhoods and new or rehabilitated facilities in commercial areas,&#13;
provided operation and maintenance is contracted to a private company.&#13;
5.   In order to make the best use of limited financial resources the MAs have decided&#13;
to provide for a mix of sanitation technologies. Recommended technological options for&#13;
each housing type are based on housing densities and household income, and subsidies&#13;
would be targeted on low-income households. In high-density, low-income housing areas,&#13;
where space limitations preclude less expensive on-site systems, the MAs intend to help&#13;
finance simplified sewers for which beneficiaries would pay the full cost of operation and&#13;
maintenance. In rural and medium-density, low-income housing areas the MAs would&#13;
split the cost of household latrines with the beneficiaries, as they are the least-cost,&#13;
technically-viable option for the area. In low-density, high-income housing areas&#13;
households would pay the full cost of on-site WC/septic tank systems.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
6.    The five cities participating in the project have elected to use part of their UESP&#13;
funds to (i) finance sanitation programs to improve services in low-income&#13;
neighborhoods and schools, and (ii) construct septage treatment facilities. In addition,&#13;
Tamale would use UESP funds to construct a new abattoir; Kumasi would rehabilitate a&#13;
community septic tank disposal system; and Tema would rehabilitate selected existing&#13;
sewers systems in two communities and improve water supply services in a third. The&#13;
table below lists the numbers and types of facilities planned for each city under the&#13;
project. These numbers may change somewhat during implementation depending on&#13;
demand and actual unit costs.&#13;

7.    Household facilities: About 15 percent of the households in low-income, medium&#13;
density neighborhoods in the five cities (where 30-45 percent of the cities' population&#13;
reside) would obtain a new household latrine through the project. While only a fraction&#13;
of the total number of households would directly benefit from the project, the component&#13;
would build demand for household latrines and put in place the public and private sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
62                           Page 3 of 6&#13;
support structures needed to construct and maintain them on a larger scale. It is expected&#13;
that additional financial support can be mobilized in the future to meet demand.&#13;
8.    Household latrines would be constructed by small local contractors who would be&#13;
selected through a prequalification process and trained to market, design and construct&#13;
household latrines. Day-to-day management services for the cities' household latrine&#13;
programs would be contracted to one or more local firms termed "management&#13;
intermediaries". Their management responsibilities would include vetting household&#13;
grant applications received through pre-qualified contractors, reviewing design at the site,&#13;
awarding individual contracts, and making payments to contractors (25% down and 25%&#13;
upon acceptance of the works). These firms would also provide training and follow-up&#13;
support to contractors. Marketing support would be provided by the city through&#13;
newspaper, radio and television advertisements.&#13;
9.    Day to day maintenance of household latrines would be the responsibility of the&#13;
households themselves. Usually households would employ private sludge haulers to&#13;
empty their latrine pits, although latrines with alternating pits can periodically be cleaned&#13;
out by hand by a household member or private individual after wastes have been&#13;
stabilized.&#13;
10.   Public Facilities: The project will finance the construction of public sanitation&#13;
facilities in commercial areas such as markets, lorry parks and light industrial areas, but&#13;
only where operation on a full cost recovery basis is possible. Operation and&#13;
maintenance would be contracted to private lease contractors who would charge a user&#13;
fee (which is currently the custom) to cover operating and maintenance costs, profit, and&#13;
a lease fee paid to the city to recover capital expenditures. Private sludge haulers would&#13;
periodically be hired by the operator to empty the latrine pits.&#13;
11.   Since household latrines provide a more convenient service at less cost than&#13;
public latrines, no new neighborhood public facilities would be built using public funds.&#13;
However, since not all residents would be able to afford a household VIP latrine even&#13;
with the proposed cost sharing program, the cities would finance the cost of minor&#13;
renovation of existing public aquaprivies and the rehabilitation of public pan latrines.&#13;
However, municipal financing would only be available to communities which agree to&#13;
contract operation and maintenance to a qualified private company. Revenues generated&#13;
from user fees at the public neighborhood facilities would cover operation and&#13;
maintenance, operators' profit, and in some cases a small rental fee. Operators would&#13;
periodically employ private sludge haulers to empty their latrine pits.&#13;
12.   School Facilities: The MAs intend to improve sanitation conditions at primary&#13;
and junior secondary schools and to instill proper hygienic behavior and attitudes among&#13;
school children. Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) would be able to obtain new or&#13;
improved sanitation facilities (VIP latrine or WC/septic tank with drain field) if (i) they&#13;
prepare a Facilities and Management Plan and (ii) collect sufficient funds to pay for&#13;
operations and maintenance for at least one year. A local management intermediary (see&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                                 ex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
Household Facilities, above) would be contracted to implement the program including (i)&#13;
promotion, (ii) assistance to individual PTAs to prepare their Facilities and Management&#13;
Plans, (iii) management of procurement, (iv) supervision of construction, and (iv) training&#13;
of selected teachers in hygiene education. Enrollment at each school averages about 400,&#13;
divided into morning and afternoon sessions. In some instances two or three schools are&#13;
clustered at the same site. Typically each would be served by a VIP latrine or WC/septic&#13;
tank with five cabins (four the children and one for the teachers). For the purposes of&#13;
implementing the UESP, schools would be grouped in batches of five to ten. Training&#13;
materials for hygiene would be provided by the local consulting firm which is preparing&#13;
similar materials for the National Community Water and Sanitation Program. Operation&#13;
and maintenance arrangements would be determined by school officials plus PTAs and&#13;
would be described in individual Facilities and Management Plans. PTAs would be&#13;
encouraged to contract a qualified private company to maintain their facility, with support&#13;
from school custodial workers. Private sludge haulers would periodically be hired to&#13;
empty the latrine pits or septic tanks.&#13;
13.   Septage Collection, Treatment and Disposal: The cities would begin to get out of&#13;
the septage hauling business by leasing at least some of their suction trucks to private&#13;
operators who could purchase the vehicles at the end of the lease period. Septage&#13;
removed from septic tanks and public latrines would be conveyed to the city landfill site&#13;
where it would be treated in a ponding system; settled sludge would be mixed with&#13;
sawdust or similar material and composted for resale as a soil conditioner or disposed in&#13;
the landfill site. The septage treatment ponds would be operated by private contractors&#13;
paid through compost sales where there is a sufficient market and/or through tipping fees.&#13;
COSTS&#13;
14.   The base cost of the sanitation component (excluding septage treatment facilities&#13;
for Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tamale which are packaged with the solid waste&#13;
disposal sites) is US$8.1 million. A summary of planned costs by city and sub-&#13;
component is given below. The distribution of costs between sub-components in a given&#13;
city may shift during implementation depending on demand.&#13;

(2) Approximately 10% of construction costs (US$220,000) and covered under design and supervision. Facilities&#13;
include septage treatment in Accra and Tema, sewer rehabilitation in Kumasi and Tema, Abattoir in Tamale, and&#13;
community water supply in Tema.&#13;

16.   Construction contracts for public sanitation facilities would be let through local&#13;
competitive bidding procedures to qualified contractors. Generally five to ten facilities in&#13;
neighborhoods (about ten contracts total) and two to three facilities in commercial areas&#13;
(about eight contracts total) would be packaged per contract. MA staff would prepare&#13;
contract documents, manage the bidding process, and supervise the construction of these&#13;
facilities. Contracts and bid evaluation reports would be reviewed by the MA Tender&#13;
Board, and contracts would be signed by the MA.&#13;
17.   Construction contracts for school sanitation facilities would be let through local&#13;
competitive bidding procedures to qualified contractors. Generally five to ten school&#13;
facilities (about 30 contracts total) would be packaged per contract. Management&#13;
intermediaries (one per city) would prepare contract documents, manage the bidding&#13;
process, and supervise the construction of these facilities. Contracts and bid evaluation&#13;
reports would be reviewed by the MA Tender Board, and contracts and payment checks&#13;
would be signed by the MA.&#13;
18.  Individual construction contracts for septage treatment facilities in Accra and&#13;
Tema, sewer rehabilitation in Tema and Kumasi, and water distribution piping would be&#13;
let through local competitive bidding procedures to qualified contractors. MA staff&#13;
would prepare contract documents, manage the bidding process, and supervise the&#13;
construction of these facilities. Contracts and bid evaluation reports would be reviewed&#13;
by the MA Tender Board, and contracts and payment checks would be signed by the&#13;
MA.&#13;
19.   Construction contracts for all household latrines would be let to pre-qualified&#13;
artisans through a private management intermediary, subject to confirmation that the&#13;
design and bill of quantities are correct. Five or more household facilities would be&#13;
packaged per contract neighborhoods (about 1,000 contracts total). A priced bill of&#13;
quantities, annually negotiated between the city and pre-qualified contractors, would be&#13;
used to set prices. Contracts and payment checks would be signed by the management&#13;
intermediary.&#13;
20.   Contracts with management intermediaries would be arranged by the MAs. A&#13;
stepwise selection process would be used in which interested local groups would be&#13;
invited to submit letters of interest together with the CVs of proposed personnel to be&#13;
assigned to the work. The group with the best management experience and technical team&#13;
would be selected, and a contract would be negotiated based upon agreed inputs and unit&#13;
costs. Contracts and evaluation reports would be reviewed by the MA Tender Board, and&#13;
contracts and payment checks would be signed by the MA. The management&#13;
intermediary would be paid on a commission basis at a flat rate of about 7.5 percent of&#13;
the construction cost of both household latrines and school facilities.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Solid Waste Component&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The solid waste component of the project is designed to address: (a) the&#13;
privatization of collection services in a portion of the five cities of Accra, Kumasi, Tema,&#13;
Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi, and (b) the implementation of sanitary landfills in the&#13;
three cities of Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi. Privatization of collection&#13;
services will be conducted through mixed contract and franchise arrangements in selected&#13;
zones and designed to optimize cost recovery according to the ability and willingness of&#13;
waste generators to pay for service.&#13;
2.    Information for the planning of the solid waste component was initially based on&#13;
the multi-sectoral feasibility studies conducted under the World Bank Urban II Project for&#13;
Tema, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi, and Bank mission efforts in Accra and Kumasi.&#13;
Siting for the sanitary landfills was conducted by municipal officials, and geotechnical&#13;
studies and topographic surveys were conducted at the selected sites to verify their&#13;
viability. Preliminary willingness-to-pay studies were conducted in Kumasi, Tamale and&#13;
Sekondi-Takoradi to determine the viability of privatization. A seminar with local&#13;
officials and potential private sector investors in July 1995 established their mutual&#13;
interest in privatization and the terms and conditions which would be necessary.&#13;
SERVICE LEVELS FOR SOLID WASTE COLLECTION&#13;
3.    According to interviews with solid waste managers, the following levels of&#13;
service existed at the time of project appraisal: Accra, 60-65%; Kumasi, 45-50%; Tema,&#13;
50-55%; Tamale, 10-15%; Sekondi-Takoradi, 40-45%. In recent years Accra and&#13;
Kumasi obtained bilateral assistance grants (from Germany and England, respectively) in&#13;
the form of solid waste collection vehicles and spare parts, and no new assistance in the&#13;
near future is anticipated. Tema, Tamale and Sekondi-Takoradi are expected to receive&#13;
new solid waste collection vehicles and spare parts in 1995 through the World Bank&#13;
Urban II Project. After receipt of the new vehicles, the service levels in these cities are&#13;
expected to be increased by 10-20%. A shortfall in service will remain in each city.&#13;
Initially, privatization will address the shortfall in service levels. Gradually, if successful&#13;
in introducing efficiency and obtaining private sector investment, privatization may be&#13;
extended to cover as much as 70% of the service requirements of each city, leaving at&#13;
least 30% of service coverage to government to conduct with its own personnel and&#13;
equipment. Transition to increased privatization will depend on natural attrition of&#13;
personnel and the ability of the government to reduce roles in accordance with personnel&#13;
performance expectations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of8&#13;
LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
4.   In Accra, the solid waste management services have been consolidated under one&#13;
department to enable full accountability for service performance and cost. In addition to&#13;
solid waste management, this department also conducts human waste collection,&#13;
treatment, and disposal. In Kumasi and Tema, consolidation has been partially&#13;
accomplished; however, sweeping and drain cleaning services continue to be provided&#13;
under the Environmental Health Division (EHD) of the Medical Officer of Health&#13;
Department (MOH). In Sekondi-Takoradi and Tamale, the traditional arrangement still&#13;
exists wherein collection vehicles and landfill equipment, including drivers, are under the&#13;
management of the Fleet Maintenance Department (FMD), and the human resources for&#13;
collection, street sweeping, and drain cleaning services are provided by the EHD's.&#13;
5.    Under the project, the Accra institutional model of a fully accountable Waste&#13;
Management Department (WMD) would be adopted by the four remaining cities. The&#13;
change to an Accra model WMD shall include bye-laws comparable to those which Accra&#13;
has enacted enabling the WMD to generate revenues through direct user charges, manage&#13;
a segregated account utilizing these revenues, directly pay the salaries of their staff,&#13;
privatize selected aspects of their service, and perform vigilance and enforcement of laws&#13;
which control waste generators and haulers. In the process of establishing the new or&#13;
more autonomous WMDs and their supportive bye-laws, attention needs to be given to&#13;
providing structures which would minimize political interference in the use of department&#13;
resources. Technical assistance to help the cities improve their institutional arrangements&#13;
and development management information systems for solid waste management is&#13;
included within the project.&#13;
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
6.    Solid waste management is a significant expenditure for local governments. For&#13;
example, in Kumasi the combined waste management services performed by the WMD&#13;
and the cleansing staff at the EHD consume about 20% of KMA's annual revenues. If the&#13;
salaries paid by central government were added, the waste management expenditures&#13;
amount to about 25% of KMA's revenues. In Tema, waste management services&#13;
consume 43% of the city's revenues, with payments to waste collection contractors&#13;
amounting to about 35% of the WMD's total recurrent expenditures. For the cities to do a&#13;
better job in this high expenditure activity, the central government should provide them&#13;
with an appropriate regulatory and technical base of support.&#13;
7.    Data collection and cost analysis on appropriate technology choices should be&#13;
conducted country-wide and technical assistance made available to the cities. Technical&#13;
assistance with privatization initiatives and implementation of sanitary landfill should be&#13;
available to the cities. A regulatory framework governing clandestine disposal, providing&#13;
sanitary landfill guidance, managing hazardous wastes, and targeting performance goals&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

needs to be put into place. These subjects will be addressed through the technical&#13;
assistance and training component of the project (see Annex 11).&#13;
ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
8.    With technical support from the German Government, the Accra WMD has&#13;
implemented a complete set of record-keeping systems on stores inventories, distribution&#13;
and costs of spare parts, vehicle maintenance histories, maintenance labor, fuel&#13;
consumption, vehicle productivity, and cost analysis as part of the development of a&#13;
management information system (MIS). The MIS is complete and fully functional, and&#13;
has been clearly established as workable for large cities. It should be replicated in&#13;
Kumasi, and possibly in a modified form should be replicated in the other three cities.&#13;
PRIVATIZATION OF COLLECTION&#13;
9.    Since 1994 in Accra, there have been private franchisees working under three-year&#13;
agreements to provide collection in mixed income areas. These include door-to-door&#13;
service and communal container service. The franchisees are required to cover their costs&#13;
through collection of user charges which are established by the AMA. Since 1990 in&#13;
Tema, private contractors have been providing door-to-door collection. TMA pays the&#13;
contractors and collects user charges which partially cover the costs of the contracts.&#13;
Since 1994 in Shama-Ahanta East, there has been a private franchise providing collection&#13;
by door-to-door service and collecting fees based on individual negotiations between the&#13;
franchisee and the property owner.&#13;
10.   While the privatization experience in these cities is limited, there is a strong&#13;
indication that extending privatized services to a portion of each city and for a selected&#13;
group of services would be advisable. Efforts to improve the zoning of the contract areas&#13;
(i.e., to assure equitable distribution of easy and difficult collection problems, and high&#13;
and low income customers) are underway . Also, efforts to move to a competitive&#13;
tendering process with payment based on productivity measures (i.e., quantity collected)&#13;
are recommended, whether the agreement is of the contract or franchise mode. A&#13;
workshop was conducted in July 1995 with local govermment officials and existing solid&#13;
waste companies as part of project preparation. The workshop participants developed&#13;
model terms and conditions for contract and franchise agreements, based on a draft&#13;
agreement provided by the World Bank, which can be used for implementation of&#13;
privatization under the project.&#13;
11.   The key to successful privatization is development of service arrangements which&#13;
are long enough to allow depreciation of investment, large enough to allow economies of&#13;
scale, and competitive enough to encourage efficiency. The project will provide technical&#13;
assistance to support each city's privatization efforts. The following privatization&#13;
concepts are to be considered for implementation by the five cities: (a) licensing of all&#13;
private haulers for subscription service of large commercial/industrial generators or&#13;
construction/demolition debris generators; (b) implementing bye-laws requiring that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                              Anex 9&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
residents and establishments hire only licensed private haulers; (c) deregulating&#13;
subscription private hauling and allowing prices to be established on the open market&#13;
without control; (d) contracts to private workshops for repairs and preventative&#13;
maintenance; (e) development of equitable zones of about 50,000 to 100,000 residents&#13;
for purposes of giving franchises or contracts for general solid waste collection service of&#13;
some of the zones, while keeping others for public service; (f) contracts for the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the land disposal facilities; (g) contracts for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of transfer facilities; (h) contracts or commissions for fee collection; and (i)&#13;
contracts for comparative performance monitoring of all key services.&#13;
COLLECTION SYSTEMS&#13;
12.   Residents comply with the communal container system and bring their wastes&#13;
regularly to the containers. Neighborhoods are clean, except for the sites where the&#13;
communal containers are located or at communal depots (i.e., open ground transfer sites&#13;
used in the case where communal container sites have not been established). Lack of&#13;
adequate equipment, spares, and maintenance systems leads to low levels of vehicle&#13;
availability and thus to poor service of these communal containers. The result is&#13;
overflowing waste, highly unsanitary conditions at the communal containers, and&#13;
infrequent cleaning of the communal depot sites which do not have containers assigned to&#13;
them. No change in the technology of the current communal container system is&#13;
recommended, only extension and improved revenue generation. Based on interviews&#13;
with local officials, the project anticipates that communal container service will be&#13;
appropriate for the following estimated percentages of city population: Accra 80%;&#13;
Kumasi 60%; Tema 50%; Tamale 50%; Shama-Ahanta East 65%.&#13;
13.   There is door-to-door collection within some neighborhoods of the five cities.&#13;
Door-to-door collection is more sanitary than communal collection and more aesthetically&#13;
pleasing because the waste is contained in the household until the time of collection.&#13;
Obtaining compliance of residents with adequate dustbin storage requires more public&#13;
education, vigilance and enforcement measures to be put into place. To the extent&#13;
feasible, where residents can comply with the household storage needs of this higher&#13;
quality of service, it should be implemented. Neighborhoods receiving door-to-door&#13;
service may be more readily privatized than those receiving communal service, because&#13;
each dwelling and establishment exclusively receives service for which it can directly be&#13;
charged a fee. Based on interviews with local officials, the project anticipates that door-&#13;
to-door service will be appropriate for the following estimated percentages of city&#13;
population: Accra 20%; Kumasi 40%; Tema 50%; Tamale 50%; Shama-Ahanta East&#13;
35%.&#13;
14.   There has been considerable bilateral support (i.e., amounting to tens of billions of&#13;
Cedis over the past eight years) given to Accra and Kumasi for their collection systems,&#13;
including vehicles, containers, spares, training, and technical assistance. Yet, in both&#13;
cases the systems are inadequate because the equipment is not being adequately repaired,&#13;
fueled, and managed. Many vehicles in the workshops of Accra and Kumasi have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                               Annex 9&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
seriously cannibalized for parts. Vehicle downtime in these cities is about 60% and 50%,&#13;
respectively. The problem lies with each city's lack of support to meet the budgetary&#13;
needs of operating and maintaining the fleet. Given this history of poor support,&#13;
provision of collection equipment to the project cities is not included in the project.&#13;
Instead, the project will support the privatization of selected zones, as discussed above.&#13;
15.   Each private collection contract will specify the shares of total costs to be covered&#13;
by user fees (to be collected by the contractors) and general revenues of the MAs. IDA&#13;
will finance 50% of the general revenue shares of a group of contracts in the five cities.&#13;
The total base costs of these contracts will be US$ 1.0 million in Accra; US$0.9 million in&#13;
Kumasi; US$0.7 million in Sekondi-Takoradi; US$0.5 million in Tema; and US$0.35&#13;
million in Tamale. IDA will finance 75% of the costs in years 1 and 2; 50% in years 3&#13;
and 4; and 25% in years 5 and 6.&#13;
DISPOSAL SYSTEMS&#13;
16.   All of the cities operate disposal by open dumping. Typically swamps, ravines,&#13;
and quarries have been used for dump sites. No soil is applied to cover the wastes at&#13;
these sites, and fires regularly burn fueled by the methane being generated within the&#13;
refuse fills by anaerobic decomposition. Tooth-wheeled payloaders and bulldozers are&#13;
used at the Accra and Kumasi sites to spread and grade the refuse so that the vehicles&#13;
have continuous access. Other sites must rely on periodically renting equipment for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
17.   Sanitary landfill facilities are planned under the project for three project cities,&#13;
namely: Kumasi (11 km. one-way from city center), Tamale (15 km.), and Shama-&#13;
Ahanta East (10 km.). Sites have been selected which appear to meet technical and&#13;
environmental site selection criteria. All sites are within viable direct transport distances&#13;
for the types of collection equipment planned. Land acquisition is being completed for&#13;
the projected needs for a 10-year life. Preliminary designs and environmental&#13;
assessments are to be completed by project effectiveness.&#13;
18.   The possibility of private operation of waste disposal facilities through management&#13;
contracts or other arrangements will be explored and, and this approach will be&#13;
implemented if possible. Experience in other countries suggests that private operation of&#13;
treatment and disposal facilities is significantly more effective than public sector operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7 1                             Anx&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
19.   Costs for solid waste collection depend on cooperation from residents in&#13;
providing readily liftable storage containers, accessibility of vehicles to collection points,&#13;
and travel distances and time between collection service areas and disposal sites. Total&#13;
owning and operating costs have been estimated for practical collection options in the&#13;
five project cities. Collection range from 11,000 to 16,000 Cedis/tonne for a travel&#13;
distance of 10 km. to 14,000 to 20,000 Cedis/tonne for a travel distance of 35 km. Total&#13;
owning and operating costs for disposal are estimated to range from 5,000 to 8,000&#13;
Cedis/tonne. Each person generates about 0.2 tonnes/year. Therefore combined&#13;
collection and disposal costs will range from 3,500 to 6,000 Cedis/capita/year.&#13;
20.  In Accra, direct charges to waste generators receiving door-to-door collection and&#13;
using communal containers provide revenues to the WMD. Private collection&#13;
contractors and franchisees generate revenues based on the same tariff schedule used by&#13;
the WMD. The tariff schedule is approved by the AMA, and in 1995 averaged a 33,333&#13;
Cedis/c.m. fee for door-to-door service, which comes to roughly 5,500&#13;
Cedis/month/household. Private haulers pay tipping fees for discharging at the WMD's&#13;
disposal facilities. Fees collected by the WMD are put into a special account for which&#13;
the WMD Director and the AMA Treasurer are co-signatories.&#13;
21.   Only about 1 1% of the total cost of solid waste collection in Accra is for door-to-&#13;
door service. All costs (even calculated costs for depreciation and spares which were&#13;
received through bilateral grants) are covered by the user charges collected. The surplus&#13;
of revenues from cost recovery for door-to-door collection is used to cross-subsidize&#13;
service by communal container, and the AMA is expected to subsidize the remainder of&#13;
the communal container service. The total city-wide costs for door-to-door service are&#13;
10.2 million Cedis/month and the total billings are 22.0 million Cedis/month. The&#13;
collection ratio on billings is above 80%.&#13;
22.  In Accra, 74% of the residents lives in densely populated low-income&#13;
neighborhoods for which communal container service is most practicable. The cost per&#13;
household for communal container collection is roughly 25% of the cost of door-to-door&#13;
service; but, this cost, as a percentage of disposal household income, is high for low&#13;
income families and not affordable by many. The WMD attempts to collect user charges&#13;
for services to waste generators receiving communal collection service. The total costs for&#13;
communal container service are 85.9 million Cedis/month and the total billings are 2.3&#13;
million Cedis/month.&#13;
23.   Kumasi has a direct fee of 3,000 Cedis/month/household for door-to-door service,&#13;
and revenues from direct charges cover about 10% of costs. Tema's tariff for door-to-&#13;
door household collection by private contractor is only 1,000 Cedis/month/household, but&#13;
recovery is over 90% of billings. Revenues from direct fees for door-to-door household&#13;
service cover about 40% of the costs of the private contracts, the rest is subsidized from&#13;
municipal general revenues. Neither city collects fees for communal container service to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
households; however, Tema collects fees for communal container service to large&#13;
commercial establishments and reportedly covers its costs. Both Kumasi and Tema&#13;
collect tipping fees from private haulers (not their own contractors) at their disposal sites.&#13;
24.   Tamale is the only project city with a bell/block system of collection. For this&#13;
type of service, the MA charges 500 Cedis/monthfhousehold. Tamale has privatized&#13;
collection by franchise agreements in one area and allows the private company to&#13;
negotiate fees directly with each household, with 10% profit sharing going to the city.&#13;
25.   Only Accra has a system of cost accounting which is used routinely for&#13;
performance evaluation. In the other cities, only data on direct municipal budget items&#13;
for salaries, parts, and consumables are available. Performing a costing exercise is&#13;
complicated by the fact that many staff are seconded to the waste management service&#13;
from other government agencies. For examnple, accounting staff are seconded from the&#13;
central government Treasury Department, audit staff are seconded from the central&#13;
government Audit Department, field supervisors are seconded from the municipal MOH&#13;
Department, and some management staff are seconded from the central government&#13;
Public Works Department. Salaries for seconded staff are paid wholly by the Department&#13;
from which they were seconded in the case of central government employees and half by&#13;
the Department from which they were seconded in the case of local govermnent&#13;
employees..&#13;
26.   Preliminary willingness-to-pay studies conducted in Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi,&#13;
and Tamale during project preparation indicate that the most residents (over 60%) are&#13;
willing to pay something for solid waste collection service. Experience in Accra and&#13;
Tema also indicates that most residents are willing to pay something for collection&#13;
service. High income residents who are well educated are likely to be willing to pay&#13;
enough to cover costs, as indicated by the Accra experience in areas serviced by door-to-&#13;
door collection. However, middle-income residents are willing to pay only a fraction of&#13;
the cost (from 40% to 50%), as indicated by the Tema experience in areas serviced by&#13;
door-to-door collection. Low-income residents are less willing to pay, and the amount&#13;
which they could afford would cover only a small portion of cost (less than 40%). To&#13;
better determine how willingness-to-pay matches service options which could be&#13;
provided, more detailed willingness-to-pay surveys should be carried out.&#13;
RECYCLING&#13;
27.   There is very little waste of recyclable value left in the refuse by the time it arrives&#13;
at the open dump sites. The small number of waste pickers who work at the open dumps&#13;
confirms the very limited value of the solid waste discharged to the collection system.&#13;
Fewer than 20 waste pickers are working at each site. Local industries for plastic, paper,&#13;
steel, aluminum, and glass provide a good market demand for recyclables, and most&#13;
wastes are recovered from the source of waste generation. No actions in recycling are to&#13;
be included in the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 8 of8&#13;
SPECIAL WASTE SYSTEMS&#13;
28.   Systems for separating infectious and hazardous medical wastes from general&#13;
hospital effuse need to be better developed. The current hospital practice of separating&#13;
only body parts and major infection wastes for special burial or burning within a hole is&#13;
not adequate. Quick lime is not used in the burial, and burning is incomplete, according&#13;
to the studies conducted under Urban II Project. Sharps, contaminated cotton, laboratory&#13;
wastes, etc., also need to be separated from the general hospital refuse. Syringe needles&#13;
were evident in large quantities within refuse at all of the city dumps visited by the&#13;
mission and contaminated cotton fabrics are apparently being recycled by waste pickers.&#13;
These wastes are currently going to the city's open dumps and present a significant hazard&#13;
to the workers and waste pickers. The wastes can have an effect on the surrounding&#13;
population due to the spread of disease by vectors such as flies. Designs for the sanitary&#13;
landfills which are planned under the project should provide for special handling and&#13;
burial of medical wastes which are suitable for landfill. For other wastes, which require&#13;
special treatment such as incineration, the project will conduct a feasibility study to&#13;
determine the most cost-effective environmentally acceptable solution.&#13;
29.   Based on visual inspection of all official city dumps in Accra, Kumasi, and Tema,&#13;
hazardous industrial waste was not evident. Interviews with the landfill staff confirm that&#13;
no large quantities are being discharged and that there have been no known cases of&#13;
chemical burn or other hazardous waste accidents at the sites. Study for Tema under the&#13;
Urban II Project further confirms that hazardous waste generation is limited. Based on&#13;
the level of industrialization present in the five project cities and the information&#13;
available, no recommendations for hazardous waste management are suggested. The&#13;
operating plans for the proposed sanitary landfills developed under this project will need&#13;
to exclude receipt of hazardous wastes, or provide a special secured location for storage&#13;
until Ghana has a national hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility.&#13;
30.   Slaughterhouse wastes are not being discharged at the existing open dumps.&#13;
Available information suggests that nearly all slaughterhouse wastes are being recovered&#13;
for use and that waste generation is minimal.&#13;
31.   As the five cities expand their sanitation systems, increased production of night&#13;
soil, septage treatment plant sludge, and wastewater treatment plant sludge will result.&#13;
These sludges are being composted with sawdust at some locations (i.e., Accra), and&#13;
there appears to be good market demand for the compost provided that the compost price&#13;
is kept low. However, as quantities of sludge increase and if market demand does not&#13;
cover the extra costs of composting, it may become necessary to dispose of this waste by&#13;
land disposal. These sludges are acceptable at the landfill as long as they are dewatered&#13;
to less than 65% moisture and they comprise no more than 10% of the volume of&#13;
incoming waste.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Community Infrastructure Upgrading Component&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The objectives of the component are to increase the health, general well-being and&#13;
productivity of selected low income communities by provision of priority basic&#13;
infrastructure and municipal service improvements which have been identified through&#13;
consultations with beneficiaries in order to promote sustainability replicability. These&#13;
objectives would be achieved by:&#13;
a) Upgrading local (secondary and tertiary) infrastructure in selected urban&#13;
communities with the severest infrastructure deficiencies in Ghana's three&#13;
largest cities (Accra, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi);&#13;
b) Promoting the use of participatory planning and design procedures and&#13;
functional, affordable standards and levels of service;&#13;
c) Strengthening the ability of local governments (Metropolitan Assemblies) to&#13;
collaborate with communities in the planning, design, and implementation of&#13;
infrastructure upgrading schemes to foster a sense of ownership by the&#13;
communities;&#13;
d) Promoting sustainable arrangements for operation and maintenance of basic&#13;
infrastructure and services.&#13;
PRINCIPLES&#13;
2.    The component has been developed in accordance with the following principles:&#13;
3.    Communities have been selected and formally approved by way of formal&#13;
resolutions of the respective Metropolitan Assemblies. Communities were selected based&#13;
on the poor state of existing infrastructure and services together with other criteria&#13;
including community cohesiveness and initiatives being taken by the communities&#13;
through the various community groups already established.&#13;
4.   Improvements have been planned and designed adopting functional standards and&#13;
service levels and to cost ceilings (per hectare and/or per capita) for affordability and&#13;
replicability reasons. The planning and design process has involved participation of the&#13;
respective beneficiary communities. A range of service level options (basic,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                              Annex 10&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
intermediate, and full) for the "menu" of possible basic infrastructure components was&#13;
developed, together with their respective cost implications (capital and maintenance&#13;
costs). These were used to commence the participatory planning process. Functional&#13;
standards and existing planning guidelines and requirements are to be adopted and&#13;
applied flexibly to ensure sensitive least cost proposals and the minimization of any&#13;
resettlement&#13;
5.    Based on initial perceptions of need and affordability, the anticipated costs would&#13;
be on the order of US$25,000 per hectare (or up to about US$ 100 per capita) dependent&#13;
on densities. Costs estimated following the survey and preliminary design process have&#13;
taken account of not only the basic infrastructure components demanded by communities,&#13;
but densities, existing service levels, and physical conditions (e.g. soils, topography)&#13;
encountered in the selected communities.&#13;
6.    The "menu" of components to be supported was made up of access (roads and&#13;
footpaths); drainage; water supply; sanitation (human waste management); solid waste&#13;
management; and street lighting. Beneficiaries expressed a preference for a "balanced"&#13;
program of improvements (including all components on the menu), mainly in order to&#13;
have a greater overall impact on the quality of life.&#13;
7.    A fundamental program criterion has been that operation and maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
costs for the infrastructure improvements will be covered through contributions from the&#13;
respective communities, whether by way of user charges, existing tariff structures,&#13;
property taxes, or other community contributions.&#13;
8.    Details of the facilities to be upgraded, their implementation, capital and&#13;
estimated annual O&amp;M cost requirements and modalities are to be set out in "Facilities&#13;
and Management Plans" to which each community (via a joint group of representatives of&#13;
both formal structures--e.g. Assemblies, Town Councils, Unit Committees, utility&#13;
agencies--and informal structures--e.g. community organizations such as religious&#13;
groups, women's groups, youth groups) is to formally agree.&#13;
9.    Assemblies are to contribute 10 percent of the total capital costs of the program&#13;
(excepting the sanitation component--see below) with the remainder funded on a grant&#13;
basis through central government.&#13;
10.   In addition to the upgrading component, a citywide sanitation program is included&#13;
as a further component of UESP which is complementary to the upgrading program. The&#13;
citywide sanitation component will include the rehabilitation of existing neighborhood&#13;
public facilities as well as establishment of a domestic sanitation program which will&#13;
require the individual beneficiary to contribute 50 percent of the cost of the VIP or pour-&#13;
flush facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76                              Annex 10&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
11.   Essential trunk infrastructure required to ensure the effective operation of&#13;
secondary and tertiary infrastructure to be upgraded will also be provided under the&#13;
component (e.g. off-site drainage) and through other UESP components (e.g. city-wide&#13;
sanitation and solid waste components).&#13;
DETAILED DESCRIPTION&#13;
12.   The component will be implemented in Ghana's three largest cities, Accra,&#13;
Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi. In each of these cities, communities severely deficient in&#13;
basic infrastructure and services were identified in a 1994 consultant's study. The&#13;
communities included in the UESP program were identified by the respective Assemblies&#13;
on the basis of the study which ranked communities according to the severity of their&#13;
needs and their prior demonstrations of community initiative and cohesiveness.&#13;
13.   In total seven communities in the three cities, covering approximately 530&#13;
hectares in which about 265,000 predominantly low-income residents reside, will be&#13;
upgraded. (see Table 1). The service levels and functional standards developed for the&#13;
sub-components are summarized below.&#13;
Access&#13;
14.   Road hierarchies have been developed in each community: distributors, collectors,&#13;
access roads and footpaths. Only the busiest routes will be upgraded, namely the links&#13;
from district distributor roads to markets, lorry parks, public sanitation sites, schools,&#13;
clinics, etc. Roads and footpaths will be surfaced. Roads will range from 4.5 m. to 7.0&#13;
m. wide dependent on function and space availability. Footpaths generally will be 2 m.&#13;
wide but also dependent on space availability. Construction will consist of double&#13;
surface dressing on 150 mm. gravel base and 150 mm. gravel sub-base. Road&#13;
construction will be closely integrated with drainage construction.&#13;
Drains&#13;
15.   The project will finance main secondary drains and drains along roads to be&#13;
upgraded. Drains will be provided on both sides of the road for wider, cambered roads&#13;
where space permits or on one side of the road for narrower typologies where roads can&#13;
drain to one side. Capacities for secondary and tertiary drains will be calculated based on&#13;
catchment areas and rainfall intensity data. Run-off will generally be based on I in 5 year&#13;
return period storm plus an allowance for sullage flows. Drains will consist generally of&#13;
open rectangular section mass concrete sections (in-situ or precast). Three sizes (widths)&#13;
will be adopted: 450 mm., 600 mm., and 900 mm. In cases where existing conditions&#13;
demand it, trapezoidal section drains will be provided. Headwalls and protection works&#13;
will be provided at outfalls to major streams or rivers. To ensure efficient discharge to&#13;
existing primary accepting channels, the component includes a limited budget for&#13;
eliminating primary drainage bottlenecks in the vicinity of outfalls.&#13;
&#13;

Water Supply&#13;
16.   Water supply system reticulation improvements will be served by existing GWSC&#13;
distribution systems. Major elements of the system will be designed such that all&#13;
compounds/houses could eventually connect to the system. However the project will be&#13;
designed to ensure coverage of no less than one standpipe available for public use (at&#13;
normal GWSC tariff rates) for every five hectares to augment existing facilities and to&#13;
ensure availability within 100 m. of all dwellings. Management of the system will be the&#13;
overall responsibility of GWSC.&#13;
Sanitation&#13;
17.   A limited number of public toilet facilities will be provided (20 seat aqua-privy&#13;
units to serve up to 2,000 people). The major part of the program will, however, provide&#13;
on-plot facilities (VIP or pour flush toilets) to householders who are prepared to fund&#13;
50% of the costs of such an on-plot facility. These facilities have been costed as three&#13;
cabin VIPs to cater for approximately 30 persons. Management of the sub-component&#13;
will be as for the city-wide sanitation component of the project, and the budget for the&#13;
sanitation in the communities to be upgraded is included within the Sanitation component&#13;
of the Project (see Annex 8).&#13;
18.   Program sizing has not only taken account of priority demands ascertained from&#13;
the communities but also affordability, overall budget limitations, and implementation&#13;
capacity realities. For these reasons the sanitation component of the program is based on&#13;
meeting about 25 percent of the estimated demand during the project period.&#13;
Solid Waste Management Facilities&#13;
19.   Communal containers (10 cu.m.) will be provided together with concrete&#13;
hardstandings at a coverage of one per four to ten hectares, with the objective of&#13;
keeping walking distances in the order of 100 m. of every property. Assemblies or&#13;
private contractors engaged by Assemblies will be responsible for servicing (collection,&#13;
disposal, return) of the communal containers (skips) in accordance with city-wide&#13;
arrangements. Disposal of refuse to the skips will be the responsibility of the individual&#13;
householders or may be through local collection arrangements organized and fumded by&#13;
the community.&#13;
&#13;

Street Lighting&#13;
20.   Basic street lighting (lanterns and required cabling) will be provided on existing&#13;
ECG poles at approximately 50 m. to 100 m. intervals or five to ten lights per hectare.&#13;
ECG will be responsible for providing electricity to the streetlights and covering the&#13;
power and maintenance costs through the street lighting tariff added to normal electricity&#13;
bills.&#13;
Environmental Infiastructure Fund&#13;
21.   A small "environmental infrastructure fund" is to be made available for each&#13;
community to support construction of minor infrastructure (e.g. small drainage channels&#13;
between properties) which is identified by the community during the course of the&#13;
project. Small schemes to access this fund will be vetted by the supervisory consultants&#13;
(see Implementation, below), and the community (through the Management Committee)&#13;
will be expected to contribute 50 percent of the scheme cost. The size of the fund&#13;
available to each community has been based on the area of the community at a rate of&#13;
approximately US$1,000 per hectare, as the infrastructure likely to be provided through&#13;
the fund is of an "area sensitive" nature (i.e. drainage).&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
22.   Costs have been kept as low as possible, and involuntary relocation has been&#13;
minimized through the adoption of functional standards and appropriate service levels. At&#13;
the completion of preliminary designs, only one area--West Maamobi in Accra--was&#13;
found potentially to involve relocation to accommodate an access road. This would affect&#13;
about approximately 31 rooms in 11 compound houses. Roughly 180 residents would&#13;
need to be relocated. Discussions already have been held between the consultants,&#13;
landlords, tenants, and officials of the AMA. In the next phase of studies, alternatives&#13;
will be considered, including further consultations with the affected people. If relocation&#13;
is deemed to be necessary, a relocation plan would be prepared following World Bank&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
23.   Basic environmental impact assessments have been carried out as part of&#13;
preliminary designs. Where necessary, appropriate localized mitigative measures to&#13;
protect surface and ground water will be incorporated into designs and bidding&#13;
documents. Generally, given the infrastructure deficiencies, extremely poor level of&#13;
sanitation, solid waste management, access and drainage in the communities, the overall&#13;
environmental impact of the component is significantly positive.&#13;

COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
25.   The base cost of the on-site infrastructure component (excluding design and&#13;
supervision costs and physical and price contingencies) is estimated at US$10.61 million.&#13;
With off-site drainage costs the total component cost is US$11.67 million. A summary of&#13;
costs by city is given below.&#13;

26.   In the communities densities are relatively high, ranging from approximately 380&#13;
persons/hectare to 715 persons/hectare. Costs of components are either "area sensitive"&#13;
(e.g. roads and drainage networks) or "population/household sensitive" (e.g. on-plot&#13;
sanitation) and range from an average of US$16,400 per hectare (Sekondi-Takoradi) to&#13;
US$27,600 per hectare (Kumasi) or US$34 per capita (Sekondi-Takoradi) to US$45 per&#13;
capita (Accra) excluding the sanitation component.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
27.   The three participating Assemblies will take the lead in implementing the&#13;
program. Beneficiary communities will be involved and consulted as necessary. In each&#13;
community a Management Committee (MC) will be formed under the auspices of the&#13;
sub-metropolitan structure and including representatives from relevant formal&#13;
government entities as well as representatives of established community groups or&#13;
organizations such as women's groups, youth groups and religious groups. The MC will&#13;
have a particularly important role, not only being the linkage with, but also the body to&#13;
resolve issues arising within the community during the construction phase of the&#13;
program, but more importantly in the subsequent management, operation and&#13;
maintenance of the facilities to be provided.&#13;
28.   Supervision of civil works and goods contracts and provision of assistance with&#13;
O&amp;M programs will be carried out by the MAs through their core project teams. The&#13;
MAs may contract with a local consultant or other group to assist with the organizational&#13;
aspects of O&amp;M in the upgrading areas. The responsibilities and functions of the&#13;
Management Committees JMCs to provide technical and financial services will be&#13;
detailed in the Facilities and Management Plans.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
29.   One major contract for "network" infrastructure (i.e. roads, drains and water&#13;
supply and streetlighting) will be awarded in each community to ensure works are&#13;
properly coordinated. In addition one small contract in each community for solid waste&#13;
container hardstandings will also be awarded. A number of small contracts are envisaged&#13;
for the "stand alone" facilities (i.e. solid waste container hardstandings) as well as works&#13;
funded from the environmental infrastructure funds. An objective of this fund is to&#13;
finance small, simple civil works capable of being done by community labor or small&#13;
local contractors, thus generating employment within the community.&#13;
30.   Management, procurement and supervision of the sanitation component in each of&#13;
the communities will be in accordance with, and be part of, the city-wide sanitation&#13;
component being implemented in each of the cities. The solid waste containers (goods)&#13;
for the respective communities in each of the towns will be aggregated, and one contract&#13;
for each town (not community) will be bid for internationally, following International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, for economies of scale.&#13;
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
31.   The funding and execution of simple O&amp;M activities (e.g. tertiary drain&#13;
maintenance) may be carried out by communities themselves. Other O&amp;M may be&#13;
undertaken by private contractors. The Management Committees will ensure that&#13;
necessary periodic maintenance is carried out by the responsible authorities and may&#13;
&#13;

32.   Operation and maintenance costs are to be covered by the respective communities&#13;
through user charges, property taxes and other contributions that might be raised from&#13;
community efforts. For water supply and street lighting the responsible utility agencies&#13;
(GWSC and ECG respectively) will be responsible for operating and maintaining the&#13;
systems, after taking them over following the end of their defects liability periods, with&#13;
funding from existing tariff revenues. It is envisaged that the community standpipes will&#13;
be franchised to private operators or community groups which would be responsible for&#13;
standpipe operation, sale of water, and payment of the GWSC water bill. Street lighting&#13;
will be maintained by private contractors engaged by ECG as is now the norm. For roads&#13;
and drainage, major periodic maintenance (i.e. resurfacing and major structural repairs)&#13;
will be carried out by the urban roads units in the respective Assemblies. However,&#13;
routine maintenance of roads and drains may be organized within the communities and&#13;
carried out by community gangs or small contractors organized through the respective&#13;
sub-metropolitan structures with budget channeled through the respective Assemblies.&#13;
33.   Estimates of total operation and maintenance costs for the infrastructure to be&#13;
upgraded have been made (Tables 1 to 5) based on a percentage of estimated capital&#13;
costs. Order of magnitude annual funding requirements for routine maintenance for roads&#13;
and drains has also been estimated (Tables 2,3, and 4), but precise estimates will be made&#13;
by the respective Assemblies prior to annual budget setting. The respective Assemblies&#13;
will agree to allocate such sums each year to the respective sub-metropolitan structures&#13;
for routine maintenance of roads and drains for the beneficiary communities commencing&#13;
in Year 3 of the project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
1.    The institutional strengthening component of UESP has two major objectives:&#13;
a) To build durable technical and management capacity related to urban&#13;
environmental sanitation at the central and local levels; and&#13;
b) To ensure that the participating agencies have the resources needed to perform&#13;
their implementation functions effectively.&#13;
2.    Accordingly, assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Local Government&#13;
and Rural Development (MLGRD), the Technical Services Centre (TSC) of the Ministry&#13;
of Works and Housing, and the five Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies (MAs) of&#13;
Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale.&#13;
3.    The institutional strengthening component will consist of the following five&#13;
activities:&#13;
SUPPORT TO MLGRD&#13;
4.    MLGRD has established a Local Government Support Unit (LGSU) which is&#13;
assisting Regional and District capital cities to improve urban services and finances.&#13;
Under the UESP, LGSU will hire individual national consultants to bolster its capacity to&#13;
provide technical and implementation support to the cities in environmental sanitation.&#13;
The inputs to be financed are as follows:&#13;

PROJECT-WIDE CAPACITY BUILDING AND TRAINING&#13;
6.    A project-wide capacity-building and training (PWCBT) program will be financed&#13;
by the project. It will be overseen by MLGRD's Local Government Support Unit. There&#13;
would be two sources of financing: the Nordic Development Fund and the Association of&#13;
Netherlands Municipalities. The PWCBT will provide assistance to the five MAs and&#13;
relevant central government agencies. Its work will be carried out by national consultants&#13;
supported by a limited number of international specialists who would provide knowledge&#13;
not available locally. This group will prepare an annual work program in response to the&#13;
needs of the client institutions and the activities of the UESP. The work program would&#13;
be approved by the clients. Each year the clients and the PWCBT group would review&#13;
the effectiveness of its activities.&#13;
7.    The CPT would cover two main areas, environmental sanitation and municipal&#13;
finances. Examples of the types of assistance to be provided include (this is an&#13;
illustrative list, not a complete one):&#13;
* Drafting of local government by-laws for environmental sanitation.&#13;
* Establishing and using performance monitoring systems for waste collection.&#13;
* Developing and implementing cost accounting and management information&#13;
systems.&#13;

9.    Each of the five MAs is establishing a project team which will be responsible for&#13;
day-to-day management of the city's sub-projects of the UESP. Each MA will hire three&#13;
long-term contract staff to form the nucleus of its project team. Regular staff of the MAs&#13;
will also be assigned to work on the project team. The Assemblies will provide offices&#13;
and office furniture for the team. The inputs to be financed by the project are:&#13;

INDIVIDUAL CITIES' CAPACITY-BUILDING&#13;
10.  It is important for each Metropolitan or Municipal Assembly to implement its&#13;
own individual capacity-building activities, apart from those undertaken by the project-&#13;
wide CPT program (item 3 above). The project will finance a package of capacity-&#13;
building resources which will be available to each city to use as it wishes, as long as the&#13;
activities are relevant to UESP. With these resources, the MAs will be able to hire their&#13;
own consultants (with terms of reference cleared by MLGRD) and finance training&#13;
activities tailored to their specific needs. Each city will be required to submit an annual&#13;
capacity building and training plan for approval by MLGRD. The inputs to be provided&#13;
by the project are as follows:&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT&#13;
lalld Titlin&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Since its early involvement in the urban sector in Ghana, the World Bank&#13;
recognized the problems associated with land delivery, land administration and the lack&#13;
of cadastral and other maps. Consequently, the Bank-assisted Urban II Project includes a&#13;
Land Administration Component whose objectives are to improve mapping, land titling,&#13;
registration and conveyancing in the main urban areas and to develop cost effective&#13;
methods of adjudicating land and issuing clear titles.&#13;
2.    The Land Administration Component consists of:&#13;
a) A Pilot Land Adjudication and Titling (PLAT) project, to support the&#13;
implementation of the 1986 Land Title Registration Law.&#13;
b) The production of 1:2500 scale photomaps for Accra and Kumasi (by KLM&#13;
Aerocarto), which would be used for the PLAT project.&#13;
c) Institutional support (vehicles and equipment) for the key land administration&#13;
agencies.&#13;
d) Studies and documentation.&#13;
3.    The project is guided by a Land Administration Steering Committee composed of&#13;
the heads of the participating agencies: the Survey Department, the Land Title Registry,&#13;
and the Land Commission. The Steering Committee is supported by a Secretariat and&#13;
directed by an internationally recruited advisor.&#13;
4.    The World Bank-supported LGDP project recognized also that up-to-date base&#13;
maps are an important component of the information base for urban planning and&#13;
development. LGDP includes a mapping component which comprises aerial photography&#13;
and digital mapping (by outside firms) of 11 towns, provision of an analytical&#13;
stereoplotter, and technical assistance.&#13;
5.    The Bank-supported Ghana Environmental Resources Management Project&#13;
(GERMP) provided the Survey Department with a modest digital mapping capability and&#13;
modernization of the photo laboratory. The digital mapping facility is employed to&#13;
establish a digital Topographic Database in support of GERMP's geographic information&#13;
systems. The PLAT Project took advantage of these facilities to carry out a "proof of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
92                             Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
concept" project to demonstrate the application of digital mapping technology for the&#13;
production of Land Title (Registry) Maps and Plans.&#13;
6.    Although the PLAT Project was slow in starting and the Advisor was not&#13;
recruited until the end of September 1994, the Project is gaining momentum and is&#13;
starting to bear fruit. Major bottlenecks in the process of land adjudication and titling&#13;
have been identified, and steps are being taken to make the whole process more efficient&#13;
and effective. To this end recommnendations were made by the Advisor regarding the&#13;
merger of the Deed Registry with the Land Title Registry, introduction of a unique parcel&#13;
identification number (PIN), and strengthening of confidence in the land title system. On&#13;
the technology side, a "proof of concept" project demonstrating the use of computer&#13;
technology for the compilation of Land Title (Registry) Maps and Plans has been&#13;
successfully completed. The potential time savings are substantial. Registry Maps could&#13;
be compiled within days instead of months, and once they are available in digital form,&#13;
the Registry Plans could be prepared in less than one hour.&#13;
7.    As a first step in introducing this technology to routine operations of the Survey&#13;
Department, a Pilot Production of Digital Registry Maps and Plans will begin early in&#13;
1996. The Survey Department will provide the hardware and some software, and&#13;
contingency funds from the Urban II Land Administration component will be used to&#13;
engage a digital mapping expert for six months and to purchase additional software. The&#13;
objectives of this Pilot Production are to work out production procedures and standards,&#13;
train personnel, and enable the implementation of this technology in the day-to-day&#13;
operations of the Survey Department when funds for modernization become available.&#13;
8.   In order to foster the development of a technologically advanced private sector in&#13;
Ghana, two Ghanaian survey firms will be engaged shortly to produce digital Land Title&#13;
(Registry) Maps in the Accra and Kumasi areas using digital orthophoto maps as the&#13;
base. These are small contracts (less than $50,000 each) involving the development of&#13;
new procedures and methods. This new approach promises substantial savings in time&#13;
and effort as compared with the traditional ways of surveying and preparing Registry&#13;
Maps.&#13;
9.    The sub-project to be funded under UESP is intended to build upon and carry&#13;
forward the progress made to date.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
10.   The overall objectives of this sub-project are to continue the initiatives started&#13;
under Urban II; to acquire a critical mass of data and experience in order to start an&#13;
irreversible process of modernization; and to prepare for the design of a major Land&#13;
Administration/Management Project which could be supported by the World Bank or&#13;
other donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93                             Annex 12&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
11.   Specific objectives are:&#13;
* To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Land Title Registry.&#13;
* To modernize the Land Registry Section of the Survey Department.&#13;
* To foster the establishment of a competent and technologically advanced&#13;
private sector.&#13;
* To assist the Lands Commission in collecting and preparing information about&#13;
state and public lands in an efficient and effective manner.&#13;
DESCRIPTION&#13;
Modernization of Land Title Office&#13;
12.   This component of the sub-project will provide the Land Title Office with modern&#13;
filing shelves, computerized document tracking, and an efficient documents management&#13;
system. This will reduce the time of processing Land Title applications and increase&#13;
outputs.&#13;
13.   An additional vehicle will provide the much needed transportation for field work&#13;
in connection with explaining the Land Title process to the public.&#13;
Cost:&#13;
- Computer software and other equipment    US$60,000&#13;
- Vehicle                                  US$30,000&#13;
Modernization of the Land Registry Section of the Survey Department&#13;
14.   Drawing on the experience of the "proof of concept" project and the Pilot&#13;
Production of Digital Registry Maps, an improved production unit will be established.&#13;
Additional PCs, workstations and a plotter will be purchased together with the required&#13;
software. The aim is for the Survey Department to be in a position to utilize a number of&#13;
different inputs such as digital orthophotos, scanned or vectorized maps, field survey data&#13;
or lists of co-ordinates for the purpose of establishing a Digital Land Registry Database&#13;
(Parcel Database) and to produce Registry Maps and Plans by automated means.&#13;
15.   An expert in digital mapping will be engaged for a period of three months to&#13;
manage this section in close liaison with a counterpart Ghanaian and to train staff in&#13;
production, quality control and management of digital data.&#13;
16.   Another important function of this component will be to provide quality control&#13;
for work done on contract with private survey firms. In addition, this component would&#13;
&#13;

demonstrate the use of Digital Land Title (Registry) Maps in the works of the Land&#13;
Valuation Board and the Town and Country Planning Department as well as provide&#13;
technical support to the Land Title Registry.&#13;
Cost:&#13;
- Computers, plotter, and software         US$100,000&#13;
- Expert in digital mapping (3 months)     US$ 50,000&#13;
Fostering the Establishment of a Competent Private Sector&#13;
17.   The demand for timely, up-to-date geospatial base information cannot be satisfied&#13;
by the Survey Department alone and must involve a competent indigenous private sector.&#13;
Many projects could be carried out more economically and rapidly by Ghanaian survey&#13;
companies than by foreign enterprises. The preparation of survey documents and&#13;
Registry maps required under the 1986 Land Title Registration Law is the best example&#13;
of the need for a competent and technologically advanced private sector.&#13;
18.   The proposed contracting out of the preparation of Land Title (Registry) Maps&#13;
with Ghanaian survey firms is a step in the right direction, towards building a competent&#13;
private sector.&#13;
19.   The work will be carried out in the Accra-Tema and Kumasi areas of the PLAT&#13;
project employing novel approaches which promise to substantially reduce costly and&#13;
time consuming ground surveys. The digital orthophotomaps will be used as the base for&#13;
identification, in the field, of property boundaries and for making measurements.&#13;
Property corners will be surveyed relative to the features which appear on the photomaps&#13;
such as buildings, fences, curbs, etc. The co-ordinates of these lot corners will then be&#13;
determined on a computer screen employing digital mapping technology.&#13;
20.   At this time there are two fair size Ghanaian survey companies capable of&#13;
undertaking this type of work. Others are in the process of organizing themselves.&#13;
21.  It is estimated that the $210,000 allocated for this item will pay for the preparation&#13;
of Registry Maps covering some 10,000 average size properties. This will undoubtedly&#13;
give a boost to the land titling process and will be the largest effort of this kind to-date.&#13;
To put this effort in a proper perspective, however, it should be remembered that in Accra&#13;
alone there are an estimated 500,000 lots and in Kumasi 80,000 lots.&#13;
22.   Nevertheless, this gradual expansion of modem titling will be a major&#13;
contribution to reducing the risks and problems associated with land transfer, will expand&#13;
the amount of real property that can be used as collateral in bank credit, and should&#13;
stimulate private sector investment.&#13;
23.   Experience gained on this project will be most beneficial in formulating and&#13;
carrying out a much larger project of Land Administration/Management in Ghana,&#13;
&#13;

hopefully to be finned with the assistance of the World Bank and/or other donor agency,&#13;
and will prepare Ghanaian survey companies to meet this challenging opportunity.&#13;
Cost:&#13;
- Contracts with local survey companies for about 10,000 properties  US$210,000&#13;
Assistance to the Lands Commission&#13;
24.   The Lands Commission is one the important Government agencies involved in&#13;
land management. It manages public lands or lands vested by law in the President, grants&#13;
consent/concurrence for all allocations of Stool, Skin and family lands, and advises the&#13;
Government and local authorities on policies for land use and development.&#13;
25.   The Lands Commission will research, collect and prepare a layer of information&#13;
on Government vested lands as well as on StoollSkin and family/clan lands within the&#13;
PLAT Project area for demarcation by the Survey Department and inclusion in the Land&#13;
Registry Maps to be prepared by the pilot project. This information will be assembled by&#13;
contacting chiefs, and collecting data from Deeds Registry, the Land Title Registry, the&#13;
High Court, the Courts of Appeal, and other sources.&#13;
26.   To accomplish this, the Lands Commission would need the services of an&#13;
experienced Licensed Surveyor and a vehicle for field operations.&#13;
27.   The infonnation provided by the Lands Commission will facilitate issuance of&#13;
Land Titles in areas adjacent to public lands and the settlement of disputes about Stool&#13;
lands boundaries.&#13;
Cost:&#13;
- Licensed Surveyor (consultant)    US$10,000&#13;
- Vehicle                           US$30,000&#13;
Land Administration and Information Systems Advisor&#13;
28.   The services of a senior expert to assist in coordinating, documenting, and&#13;
providing technical advice will be required.&#13;
Cost:&#13;
- Senior Adviser        US$60,000&#13;
&#13;

            Ghana - Urban Environmental Sanitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Urban
            Environmental Sanitation Project are: 1) to promote
            productivity and raise living standards in Ghana's
            major cities, especially for lower-income people, by
            improving drainage, sanitation, and solid waste services; 2)
            to help establish better institutional and financing
            mechanisms and more effective policy frameworks so that
            improvements are sustained overtime; and 3) to build up the
            capacity of the Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies to
            manage environmental sanitation services. The project will
            cover Ghana's five major cities: Accra, Kumasi,
            Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale. It will have five main
            components: 1) storm drainage; 2) sanitation; 3) solid
            waste; 4) upgrading of low-income urban areas; and 5) capacity-building.
