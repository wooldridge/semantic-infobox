&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                           2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Well, in this, of course, I have to answer your questions linked with my&#13;
own tenure in PLN [Perusahaan Listrik Negara, State Electricity Company], you know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Please tell us that, yeah, please tell us that.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: I was appointed by the government to become a member of the board of&#13;
management, as we called, you know, the board of management since 1970. But eleven&#13;
years before 1970 I'm starting with this PLN as a brand new engineer, starting fromâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
what do you callâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;generation engineerâ&#128;&#157; up to the regional manager for the whole West&#13;
Java area responsible for generation, transmission and distribution. Within the ten years,&#13;
eleven years, after I joined with PLN, then I got the assignment as a member of board of&#13;
management in 1970 as a director of finance and commerce, 1970, this up to 1972. And&#13;
from 1972 to 1975 I was appointed as the director of operations. And from 1975 to 1980&#13;
I was assigned as the director of planning in PLN. And from 1980 to 1985 I was&#13;
appointed as the president director for the first time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: President?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: President director, yes, my first term, and from 1985 and 1980 [1990] I&#13;
was appointed as president director for my second term. And then 1990 I fully retire. So&#13;
answering to your question, I was involved with the World Bank since the&#13;
implementation of the first loan from not the World Bank but from the IDA&#13;
[International Development Association] .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: IDA.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: The World Bank, but IDA. Not the IBRD [International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development] yet for the first loan. The implementation of the first&#13;
loan of the IDA is in the year 1970.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 1970?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, the same time when I was appointed as the director of finance and&#13;
commerce. And then the main project is covering a small distribution project in the city&#13;
of Jakarta, but the big part of the project is for financing for the whole management&#13;
reform in PLN.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, management reform.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Management reform.&#13;

                                        Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                                 November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did that involve technical assistance or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, no, that is a loan, soft, what you call a loan from IDA.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A soft loan, yes. But what was the nature of the--what did you buy with the&#13;
loan?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: This I told you. There are two projects: one is a physical project, a&#13;
distribution project in the city of Jakarta, and the other project is management reform in&#13;
PLN. What we got is improving for, into institutional administration, finance and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And that's why I asked you, then, did you have some experts, some expatriate&#13;
advisors, consultants, who came in?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes. At that time we are appointing consultant from France, thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
SOFRELEC, in association with several consulting firms like Peat, Marwick, Mitchell,&#13;
for finance and other consultants. I don't remember again, but this is--the main job is to&#13;
provide a physical distribution project in the city of Jakarta and the other is for&#13;
management reforms, institutionally, financial, organization, management and so on.&#13;
&#13;
The loan is coming from IDA. It's not much. At the time is only 15 million U.S. dollars&#13;
for the [inaudible] . I involved the implementation of the first loan, that loan. I don't&#13;
involve in the appraisal of that project.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: But then from the second project to the sixteen project . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sixteen?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Sixteen. I was involved since the appraisal of the project, the negotiation&#13;
of the project, and the implementation of the project.&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact, the loan is not directly to PLN. The borrowing is the government.&#13;
The PLN is the beneficiary. So then we have two--what do you call--legal documents,&#13;
that is a loan document, loan agreement, signed by the government of Indonesia and the&#13;
World Bank and a project agreement signed by PLN and World Bank. But the project&#13;
agreement is, of course, under jurisdiction to the loan agreement.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And different interest rates, I imagine.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, no, no, no, no, no. The interest rate that the government paid is&#13;
according to the regulation of the World Bank, but up to a certain time the loan from the&#13;
World Bank passed through government as subsidized together.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At the same rate?&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: As I told you, as a subsidy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Subsidized?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Free.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, free. But then I don't know the second or the third or the fourth&#13;
loan. This loan created by the government as a re-loan from government to PLN with the&#13;
same rate.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Same rate as they paid the Bank, huh?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did that change later?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, up to my . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They always had the same rate?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the rate the market rate or was it subsidized?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Which one?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The re-loan from the government of Indonesia to PLN.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: At the same rate, same rate that the government gets from the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And this rate, was IDA the first one? Later on they weren't IDA loans, I&#13;
suppose. I mean, what, sometime in the â&#128;&#152;70s, you were getting IBRD loans.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, IDA loans.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Always IDA?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No. Up to a certain--I don't forget which loanâ&#128;&#148;changed from IDA to the&#13;
IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's what Iâ&#128;&#153;m asking, yes.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: From the IBRD, of course, they implement the loan from the IBRD.&#13;
From the IDA they implement the loan from IDA. But at the first beginning of the&#13;
&#13;
                                 Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                          November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
implementation of the loan, the government paid the loan, the money from the World&#13;
Bank to PLN as an equity, but then I don't know how much, when the loan created by the&#13;
government as a re-loan from the borrower, from the government, to PLN with the same&#13;
rate they got from IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. And therefore when they went from borrowing from IDA to IBRD, the&#13;
interest rate went up, and the interest rate charged PLN also had to go up.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course! You see, the same, the same rate. Of course, the rate from&#13;
the IDA and from IBRD are different.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Were most of the sixteen projects, were they mainly for generation or for&#13;
generation and for transmission?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: The most emphasized at that time was generation and distribution&#13;
because at that time the condition of our PLN in theâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--generation was&#13;
very, very poor. So the first attack from the World Bank is to help to provide the&#13;
generation, and then later on, step by step, they moved into transmission and distribution.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These are all thermal projects, right?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Mostly thermal projects. The World Bank financed the hydro projects;&#13;
it's only the big hydro at Saguling and Cirata in the year about 1980, something like that.&#13;
So after so many loans they started a big project, a hydro project, but for the first&#13;
beginning it's distribution and then generation: thermal, oil-fired, transmission step by&#13;
step, and then big distribution and then big hydro.&#13;
&#13;
But at the same time in every loan they provide to the PLN, they provide also some&#13;
money for consultancy, for instance, improvement of financial aspects, improvement of&#13;
the functional administration aspect, improvement for the planning aspect. So in every&#13;
loan they comprise of a physical project, a study of an engineering for the other project,&#13;
and consultancy for management, step by step.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: And there PLN at the beginning is, of course, fully subsidized by the&#13;
government. And then with the loan, the World Bank and the government set a target&#13;
that PLN should be recovery, step by step, financially. And fortunately the target can be&#13;
reached and then start step by step to make an internal rate of return from the operation.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Were there any sort of issues with the World Bank over the years on cost&#13;
recovery [both speaking at once] consumers?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Well, of course, the World Bank, since the name is International Bank for&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reconstruction and Development, in order to appraise the project, they appraise also any&#13;
aspect of PLNâ&#128;&#148;what you call--management, financially, costing, organization,&#13;
everything. They go enter into theâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--bottom of the problem, and they&#13;
sit together with us. If they don'tâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--appreciate the result of that aspect&#13;
and then we start to negotiate how to improve and we make a plan and every new&#13;
consultant they provide money for consultantâ&#128;&#153;s costs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And these, the people you dealt with, negotiated with in the Bank, were they--&#13;
did they have a continuity through time? Did you have the same people working in&#13;
Indonesian power for some years at a time so that they got to know the situation?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, yeah. Of course, they have changed.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, sure.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: But then in a period of the assignment of theâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--experts&#13;
in the World Bank, they involve deeply in a certain period.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These were engineers in many cases? Their profession was engineers, the&#13;
people in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: It depends. It depends. There are finance, engineer, procurement&#13;
engineer, and then there are so manyâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--structural organization who&#13;
handle directly with the government and with us.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. I see. I see.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So in the roughly twenty years you dealt with the World Bank, did you see any&#13;
change in the World Bank in the way they approached the power sector?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. For the first time I got the impression that the World Bank is&#13;
number one. He is always the man who knows better everything.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At the beginning?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: At the beginning. And at the beginning I was very afraid because I&#13;
assessed that they are very experienced. But later on we know each other. We can talk&#13;
openly. We know whatâ&#128;&#153;s--how to set the target. We know how to implement the project.&#13;
We can tell what we need.&#13;
&#13;
And they start also--they make some change in the approach. They are more and more&#13;
listening to us and more and more give the confidence to us. It is, of course, normal, you&#13;
know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah. So they learned along the way, too?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. Both sides learned very much. We learned how toâ&#128;&#148;what do&#13;
you call--at least the way how they solve the problems, yeah, the way they are&#13;
considering the problems. But they are also learning that not always the rule can be&#13;
implement in a certain country. They have to realize the condition, the situation, but the&#13;
main what we call rules should be implement without anyâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--change.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Did your work involve at all getting involved with the so-called technocrat&#13;
group, the Widjojo [Nitisastro] group? Did you work with those government&#13;
economists?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: If you call â&#128;&#156;work with them,â&#128;&#157; I am the implementing agency; they are the&#13;
policymaker. So I follow the policy, the general policy from those gentlemen.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, I see, okay. How about in terms of general policy? Did you ever have&#13;
any energy survey, major power study here?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes. Yes we . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: When was that?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Well, that's my difficulty if you are asking detail when, you know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're not talking, but approximately.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: As a matter of fact PLN is not the entity who is responsible for the total&#13;
energy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: But we have to make our study in order to get an electricity energy with a&#13;
comparable price, reliable supply and so on. That's why we make our own study for&#13;
several energy resources. And during my time we are able to diversify. When at the&#13;
beginning of the loan we have only fuel, oil as a fuel, and small hydro. When I left the&#13;
office I have already coal, I have already natural gas generation, I have alreadyâ&#128;&#148;what do&#13;
you call--geothermal potential generation. So we diversify into hydro, fuel, geothermal,&#13;
coal, and natural gas.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And how about across the whole country? You must have different sources for&#13;
different parts of different islands.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course, because our country is comprised of so many islands it's&#13;
impossible to make interconnection with the whole island, you know. Look at here.&#13;
[apparently goes to a map] Now when I left office I have already succeeded to make an&#13;
extra high voltage along the Java island. It means that all this area in Java can be not&#13;
only interconnected but as an integrated system. And then we are also able to connect&#13;
with the submarine, people from Java to Bali island and from Java to Madura island with&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a 150 kV submarine cable. So practically this is already in the one grid.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: But it is important, you know, because 75 percent of the population of&#13;
Indonesia is in this small islands. And then the most rich of resources in our area is first&#13;
Sumatra. They have coal, they have natural gas, they have geothermal, they have hydro:&#13;
everything. And we develop here hydro, thermal, and we started now to inter-connect&#13;
this area, pick up one, and half of this area is already interconnected.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: In this area, North Sumatra, you don't need that. And you have a Lake&#13;
Toba. The governmentâ&#128;&#148;not the government, the Japanese invest the aluminum smelters,&#13;
but they have this own power station from this Lake Toba. In this area the developed is&#13;
in the east side and the southern part here and also in the western part. We don't have yet&#13;
interconnection here because, you know, the area is in the middle of nowhere, a big area&#13;
but small population. Here is much more, you know, developed in this area. This is&#13;
alreadyâ&#128;&#148;we have one interconnected system in this area and in this area, but this is still&#13;
individual. This also is individual, and Irian, Basilan also individual, this part, this part,&#13;
this part, this part. [ apparently pointing to various areas on the map]. And all small&#13;
islands additional, aditional. This is a very difficult task for PLN, you know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It must be very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: So many islands, and then the concentration of the population is dense in&#13;
this Java island. The other rich in natural resources, but thereâ&#128;&#153;s no demand compared to&#13;
Java.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you own many of the small, individual . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes, yes. We have so many. That is the difficulties of us, that in these&#13;
areas we can easily make internal rate of return. This area we have to subsidize.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was going to ask you about your rate structure. Do you charge the same tariff&#13;
to all areas or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: We have a standard tariff.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Across the whole country?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Across the whole country, only we have functional group with different&#13;
each other. There are residential, there are social, there are commercial, there are&#13;
industrial, there are street lighting, there are public lighting and so forth. But for the&#13;
whole country the same.&#13;

WEBB: The World Bank has always accepted that?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I would think not. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, but don't forget that the World Bank is, in this case, is not able to--&#13;
finally they realized that it is a political issue. It is a governmentâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--&#13;
decision which nobody can . . .&#13;
&#13;
But principally the government is going to introduce that no subsidies will be provided&#13;
for PLN. So PLN has to grow with its own capability.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But you still can do this cross-subsidizing?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. We can use a cross-subsidy inter-areas but also a cross-subsidy&#13;
between the consuming groups.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But in the â&#128;&#152;70s and â&#128;&#152;80s did PLN get a financial subsidy from the government?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No. What I called a subsidy in the terms of development, construction,&#13;
new projects. For operations, since I am the director of finance, I never got subsidized&#13;
for the operation. But for the new projects we have, as equipping, not subsidized.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Have there been any disputes or discussions with the World Bank on the entry&#13;
of the private sector in these key [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. There are a lot of discussions about that&#13;
because the World Bank also realized that if the electricity is provided all by the&#13;
government, itâ&#128;&#153;s required a lot of money. That's why they invite also for private&#13;
enterprises goes into that area.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In particular areas?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: In particular areas, because mostly PLN has already operated in all area&#13;
of Indonesia in order to--not to confusing in the area of operation of course there are&#13;
someâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--agreements, for instance, between the ministry of mines and&#13;
energy (who has the PLN) with ministry of cooperation. The cooperatives built also&#13;
some, develop in the electricity in several areas. In this case we don't enter to this area,&#13;
and they don't also enter into PLN areas.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have any large enterprises, manufacturing enterprises that are self-&#13;
supplying, generate their own electricity?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: There are so many what you call private who own his own generation but&#13;
not for selling to the public.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, no, to supply themselves.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. As I told you, the smeltering in Lake Toba, they have more than&#13;
400 megawatt installed in hydro. And then here in the middle of nowhere in the Sulawesi&#13;
area there is the nickel, Inco. They have a hydropower station with about 180 megawatts.&#13;
And then here, what we call the area of, mining area, here also a big thermal power plant.&#13;
And, of course, the oil company, the Pertamina, who have so many installations&#13;
throughout the country, they provide electricity by themselves.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What kind of a price do you have to pay for oil? Do you buy your oil from&#13;
them?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: According to the government decision, we don't have any subsidies, no.&#13;
You pay for your car the same PLN paid for that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When did the World Bank stop insisting that you have different prices?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: What do you mean?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, they normally prefer you to have different prices, and they would insist.&#13;
In 1970 they [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Since the beginning. Since the first loan they introduced that, â&#128;&#156;Why don't&#13;
you bill electricity to areas according to the cost?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, but they've stopped insisting or not? They haven't made [both speaking&#13;
at once]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: They always made their recommendation, but the government doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
agree with this recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Even now they always . . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, even now they are insisting like that. Then finally the World Bank&#13;
sent a proposal to the government, â&#128;&#156;Okay. Let's stop only the internal rate of return of&#13;
the whole PLN.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When was that?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, in â&#128;&#152;75.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: â&#128;&#153;75.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: That's the recovery plan. You know, at that time we just recover about 80&#13;
percent of the costs, and then step by step by introducing the efficiency, by tariff&#13;
adjustment, by all things to improve the efficiency we can reach the break-even point and&#13;
will start to make a profit, and then they set a target of internal rate of return with the&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can see that the national unity argument in this place would be particularly&#13;
volatile.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: It's not a small job, you know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But in that plan when the World Bank understood the political necessity, who&#13;
was in the Bank? Who was the principal person negotiating that? Do you remember?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course, I have to mention a gentleman who is sitting in the board of&#13;
management, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, you know, of course, who is . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [Robert S.] McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course, the president at that time is McNamara, and then there are&#13;
directors, you know . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Vice presidents?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Vice presidents, who used to be the resident mission here. I forget the&#13;
name.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Dr. Bell, yes. And then he is--what do you callâ&#128;&#148;his successor is . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Shahid Husain?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Shahid Husain.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Burke Knapp get involved at all? He was the sort of executive vice . . [both&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, Iâ&#128;&#148;what you call--witnessed only to Shahid Husain. No, [Attila]&#13;
Karaosmanoglu. I know him also. So since theâ&#128;&#148;of course, as we said at the time, it is&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McNamara, but also the successor of Mr. McNamara is . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: [Alden W.] Clausen?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Clausen, yeah. He was also visiting here the project, our projects here&#13;
also with me, Clausen, yeah. So the director is since Dr. Bell, and then who is it? Shahid&#13;
Husain?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Shahid Husain.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: And then Karaosmanoglu. Who else? I involved only up to&#13;
Karaosmanoglu in the level of the board of management, but at that time the organization&#13;
is, there isâ&#128;&#148;what do you callâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s not yet by areas. It is by industry and so on. So there&#13;
are so many gentlemen in this . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Probably Warren Baum who might have been involved as he was at the vice&#13;
president at the level, looking after these sectoral project groups.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: At that time there was Central Projects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, he was head of Central Projects.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Central Projects and there were individual projects by areas. I have so&#13;
manyâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--names but I do forget the names of these gentlemen.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Each of these sixteen loans, did you or someone . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Now it is about nineteen or twenty.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. Do you go to Washington each time you sign them, or do they sign&#13;
them here?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, the signing, to be practical, the government and PLN sent a letter of&#13;
attorney to our ambassador in Washington, but one time I signed it by myself for the&#13;
project agreement. So the loan agreement is signed by the borrower, government, in this&#13;
case minister of finance, but always by the Indonesian ambassador in Washington, and&#13;
the project agreement signed by the beneficiary, that is PLN, and at that time also always&#13;
signed by the Indonesian ambassador in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. Good.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did PLN have many other lenders besides the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes. The whole IGGI [Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia] group,&#13;
near the whole IGGI group is providing loan for PLN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is that so?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah. The big, the giant is, of course, IBRD, World Bank. And then&#13;
come to Asian Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And from Japan?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: That is multilateral basis. World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and&#13;
then bilateral: Japan, French, German, Netherland, Belgium, Italian, Swiss, Norway. At&#13;
the beginning, of course, U.S. AID [Agency for International Development] , but then&#13;
stop, this AID.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These are all tied?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Sometimes tied, sometimes untied, but mostly tied.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When you're planning your new projects, how did you decide who was going to&#13;
finance?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Well, of course, as a matter of fact in my time I have always a short-&#13;
range plan, five years, and long-range, medium-range ten to fifteen, and a long-range,&#13;
twenty to twenty-five. In the short-range program there are always and already&#13;
determined fix the status of the project. For instance, Project A is under construction.&#13;
Project B is under study or under engineering, and Project C is in the period of study.&#13;
&#13;
As you know, there are annual meetings for the IGGI members, you know. Of course,&#13;
before the annual meeting all the IGGI members' officials already get what they call a&#13;
â&#128;&#156;blue bookâ&#128;&#157; from BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National&#13;
Development Planning Board] . A â&#128;&#156;blue bookâ&#128;&#157; is a list of projects which contains the&#13;
position or the condition of project, whether it is already ready for financing of&#13;
construction, whether it is still under engineering, whether it is still under identifying or&#13;
study. Every IGGI member indicates himself what is his interest, first, in this very first&#13;
beginning. But since this project is already out from our kitchen, we plan already. So&#13;
whatever they make its choice, it always will come to us because it is already in the short&#13;
period of planning.&#13;
&#13;
The problem now is whether the counterpart rupiah, the local costs, can be provided or&#13;
not. Sometimes is okay. Sometimes it's rather difficult. Then we have to cook again&#13;
which one the priority, because whatever the---what do you call--foreign costs is&#13;
available, we have to, have to provide the local costs. It is not always when the foreign&#13;
costs is already provided then we do agree to start with the project; we have also to&#13;
provide the local costs for the land acquisition, for the other local costs and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And the donors don't ever provide local costs, huh?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: At the very beginning, no. They are very strict.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, I know.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: But sometimes, sometimes, in the end of my assignment in PLN, the&#13;
World Bank also can realize that, for instance, several local product, as long as they can&#13;
participate in the international tender, they willâ&#128;&#148;what do you call--finance it if they win&#13;
the tender. But sometimes also by a certain reason they do agree to provide the financing&#13;
for a certain product of equipment local [inaudible] Of course, the percentage is very&#13;
small compared to the whole budget.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So in any one year you have many projects under construction, normally.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And from different donors, different lenders.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes. Look at this. Electricity is needed by people here [apparently&#13;
pointing to the map again], but at the same electricity is also needed by people there so&#13;
that when we have to have every area in order we can develop, of course, with the same&#13;
speed.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So sometimes here you have Japanese, there you have French, here you have&#13;
the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes, yes. But sometimes one project also comprised of several, you&#13;
know, financing it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And do all of them provide consultants or technical ideas, management ideas?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, consultants assigned by us.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: By you.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: By us. And mostly we look for World Bank financing for the&#13;
consultants.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So you always have control over the ideas that youâ&#128;&#153;re getting.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You donâ&#128;&#153;t--have you had much different ideas, problems with [both speaking at&#13;
once]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Of course during the discussions there are so many standards and so on.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
That's why we have toâ&#128;&#148;what you call--fix first, like standards and so on, in order to&#13;
avoid all theâ&#128;&#148;what you call--gray areas [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You pick out a specification so that when you make a grid of these different&#13;
inputs they do fit together.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you have one key consultant who is your, like your brother, your&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, no. We never act like that. It's depending upon the project. In every&#13;
project mostly we have consultants.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But when you--for instance, you're going to get Japanese financing for some&#13;
project, or Dutch, do you discuss that with the World Bank in particular?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: No, no, no. But the World Bank might know to--what do you call--to&#13;
study, of course, for its own purposes. They can ask us, yeah, but they don't evaluate the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Only their projects?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Only their projects. But they evaluate the total management of PLN, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, you started this work in 1959, I think you said.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yeah, 1960 about, yeah, â&#128;&#152;60.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You came as a young engineer. You were trained in this country or . . .&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: I was graduate in this country from Bandung Institute of Technology.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. And so you were turning out in this country engineers pretty early on, is&#13;
that right?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So you had your own sort of expertise?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes. For instance, I myself, I get my own expertise, but I have the vision&#13;
to get the training in France for one and a half years.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. When was that?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: It was before the loan, in 1967 to â&#128;&#152;68.&#13;
&#13;
                                  Ir. Sardjono&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, I see. I guess maybe we . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Why donâ&#128;&#153;t I ask one more?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sure. Go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Can I come back to pricing? One question is the overall price, but there's also&#13;
the tariff.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Have you had many disagreements with the Bank on tariffs?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Oh, yes. But we are in the same idea, that to develop as this tariff, the&#13;
level of the tariff, we have to use the method long-range marginal cost. That was the one&#13;
principle that we do agree with the Bank. So we are using the long-run marginal cost. Of&#13;
course, yeah, in these long-run marginal costs we have to count the local condition, you&#13;
know. That was important. But how to set the level in every functional groups,&#13;
sometimes you have different ideas with them, of course, because World Bank is&#13;
comprised of experts and we are also comprised of experts. No, but finally, finally the&#13;
decision is the government.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The World Bank people in Washington and also here, they all say the same&#13;
thing: Indonesia, their projects have lots of problems, but power has always been good&#13;
projects. It's the area they say thatâ&#128;&#153;s most successful in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Why?&#13;
&#13;
SARDJONO: Well, I always get that question. I rather hesitate to answer this question,&#13;
you know!&#13;
&#13;
What I feel is that before we go with a project, before we go with this development,&#13;
fortunately we are able to organize, as I told you, the first loan from the World Bank--&#13;
that's management reformâ&#128;&#148;into institutionally organization, finance and so on, until the&#13;
government also provided some facilities to us, you know? The government has&#13;
promulgated the Government Regulation Number 18 in the year 1972. We were able to&#13;
provide PLN organization into that capability. So the government provided these&#13;
facilities.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time we have succeeded recruitment of our young engineers at that time--&#13;
now they are already experts--but in the early â&#128;&#152;70s, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the area.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Were they trained mostly in country or abroad, the young engineers?&#13;
