A. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1.Project Rationale&#13;
&#13;
1.       Afghanistan i s one o f the poorest and longest-suffering countries among the members o f&#13;
the WorldBank. More than two decadeso fconflict andpolitical instabilityhaveresultedin&#13;
severely damaged infrastructure, a degradednatural resourcebase, weakened public institutions,&#13;
and fragmented political authority. A severe drought lasting from 1999 till 2002 has further&#13;
increasedrural poverty and depleted assets. Both the conflict and the drought have resulted in&#13;
massive populationdisplacements and disruption o f livelihoods. Among the country's estimated&#13;
22 million people, around a quarter are critically poor, and a larger number are vulnerable to risks&#13;
o f external economic and natural shocks.&#13;
&#13;
2.       About three quarters o f the Afghan populationare estimated to live inrural areas and are&#13;
mainly dependent on agriculture. Landholdingsvary in size between and within provinces, with an&#13;
average farm size rangingbetween 1-2 hectares. Absentee landownership i s common as a result o f&#13;
emigration o f families or family members to neighboring countries, share-cropping seems to be&#13;
expanding inmost provinces, and rural indebtedness i s widespread.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Despite the assistance provided to the rural populationby Afghan and international NGOs&#13;
as well as the UNsince the late eighties, the needs o f the rural populationregardingassistance to&#13;
cope with bothreconstruction and the legacy o fmore than twenty years o f deferred development&#13;
are enormous. Thus, only about a third o f the area under irrigation in 1993 was irrigatedin2002,&#13;
and local community-based irrigation systems require desilting o f canals and repair o f structures to&#13;
become fully functional (the area under irrigation only increased by 1%in2003). Most village&#13;
roads are inneed o f culverts andbridges to make them passable throughout the year, the large&#13;
majority o f children do not have access to education or are taught under the open sky, there i s&#13;
almost no access to electricity inrural areas, and the majority o f the country's populationdoes not&#13;
have access to safe drinkingwater.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Addingto the urgency for large-scale assistance to promote the recoveryo fAfghanistan's&#13;
rural communities i s the return from neighboring countries o f some 2.3 million refugees since late&#13;
2001.* Another halfmillion Afghans who were displaced inside the country have also retumedto&#13;
their homes. Unless economic activity and employment grows inrural areas, returnees will not&#13;
find itattractive to retumto their villages o f origin, andthe trend o furbanmigration is likely to&#13;
continue and exacerbate the growthproblems already faced by Kabul and other cities. Since&#13;
Afghan cities and inparticular Kabul have shown recovery over the past two years, particularly in&#13;
the construction and service sectors, they attract retuming refugees who expect to find improved&#13;
stability and betterjob opportunities compared to most rural areas. Approximately 30% o f the&#13;
returnees have moved to Kabul city and province. As a result, the population o f Kabul has&#13;
increased from 600,000 inhabitants inthe late seventies to an estimated 3 million today. UNHCR&#13;
estimates that there remain about 1.5 million Afghan refugees inPalustan and 1.2million inIran.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Since the end o f the three year drought in 2002, agricultural production inAfghanistan has&#13;
continuedits strong recovery for the second consecutive year primarily due to favorable&#13;
precipitation and the expansion o frainfed farming. Aggregate cereal productionestimated at 5.37&#13;
million tons i s the largest on record. However, despite the good harvest there are still a&#13;
considerable number o fAfghans who face food insecurity and will continue to depend on targeted&#13;
&#13;

2003. The succeeding informationbelow on agriculture draws o n this report.&#13;
2        UNHCRHumanitarian UpdateNo. 68,UNHighCommissioner for Refugees, August 2003.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
food assistance during2003/04. Inthe northern surplus producing areas (primarily Baghlan,&#13;
Kunduz, Takhar) there has been major improvement infood security. At the same time there are&#13;
chronically food insecure areas like the Central Highlands (Hazarajat) and Badakshan. Elsewhere&#13;
inthe countrythe picture ismixedand areaso fimprovedharvests contrast with pockets ofhigh&#13;
vulnerability and food insecurity.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The description above indicates that reconstruction and development needs differ&#13;
substantially across regions and even locally. To address this situation, a flexible assistance&#13;
program is needed, that takes as its point o f departure peoples' own local knowledge about their&#13;
priorities for reconstruction and development, that facilitates a participatoryprocess to assist&#13;
communities to agree on the priorities that needto be dealt with and how, and that provides&#13;
resources which enable communities to implement sub-projects that address these priorities. The&#13;
National Solidarity Program (NSP) has been designedwith these requirements inmindto provide&#13;
assistance to rural communities across the country. The proposed Emergency National Solidarity&#13;
Project (ENSP), supported by the InternationalDevelopment Association (IDA) andby other&#13;
donors, will assist implementation o fthis nationalprogram&#13;
&#13;
2. Government Strategy&#13;
&#13;
7.       The project would support the Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan's (TISA) National&#13;
Programme for Reconstruction, by promoting three o f its key elements, namely the use o f&#13;
assistance to create conditions for people to live secure lives and buildhuman capital, physical&#13;
reconstruction, and private sector development. The project would constitute one o f the six&#13;
nationalpriority sub-programs   -  the National Solidarity Program -under one o f the 12National&#13;
Development Programs: Livelihoods and Social Protection. The goal o f the NSPis to reduce&#13;
poverty through empowering communities with regardto improved governance, and social, human,&#13;
and economic capital. The key development issues that the project will address are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Ruralreconstruction: The project will provide resources throughblock grants to rural&#13;
         communities for investments inreconstruction or development activities plannedand&#13;
         managedby the communities themselves. Activities will either be implementeddirectly by&#13;
         the communities or through sub-contracting to the private sector.&#13;
    0    Strengthening o f local governance: Decisions on the use o fblock grants will be made&#13;
         through an inclusive participatory decision making process ledby community development&#13;
         councils elected through secret ballot. This process will facilitate the emergence o f&#13;
         consultative decision making and legitimate local leadership, which can form the basis for&#13;
         cooperationbetween communities and the local government apparatus as well as with&#13;
         other assistance programs.&#13;
    0    Enhancing government effectiveness: Capacity would be builtwithin the Ministryo f&#13;
         RuralRehabilitation &amp; Development (MRRD)to set and supervise standards and&#13;
        procedures for financial management, disbursement, and implementation of community&#13;
         projects plannedand implementedby local communities and funded byblock grants.&#13;

8.        The project i s consistent with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (of March2003),&#13;
and will promote this strategy by (i)   strengthening communities to develop and carry out plans for&#13;
local development, (ii)   generating incomes for the poor through wages eamed from community&#13;
projects and fiom the assets and skills created through these projects, (iii) enabling private sector&#13;
development through supply and implementationcontracts for community projects, and (iv)&#13;
increasing access to basic social services.&#13;
&#13;
2. Lessons from earlier experienceinAfghanistan and other post-conflict situations&#13;
&#13;
9.        International experience suggests that ina number o f sub-sectors suited for community&#13;
management, projects that are planned and managedby the communities themselves typically show&#13;
rates o freturn higher than those planned and managedby government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
10.       A growing body o f evidence from Bank-financedprojects demonstrates that community&#13;
projects are particularly appropriate for post-conflict environments. Inthe Rwanda Reintegration&#13;
Project, for example, close attention to usingjoint community activities to promote reconciliation&#13;
between ethnic groups has been successful and led the Rwandan Government to extend the design&#13;
into its national development plan. Another benefit o f this approach inpost-conflict environments&#13;
i s its speed. The East Timor Community Empowerment Project was able to attain national&#13;
coverage within one year of appraisal, albeit ina very small country and buildingon an existing&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
11.       Bearing inmindthat the Afghan context i s inmany ways sui generis because o f the&#13;
extreme levels o f destruction and the long-term nature o f the conflict, the project draws on several&#13;
general lessons from other community development and post-conflict projects. These include:&#13;
&#13;
          Community block grant projects can be scaled up very quickly and can function inhighly&#13;
          diverse environments because o f their modular design;&#13;
          Establishinga participatory process and community development councils initially adds&#13;
          time to sub-project preparation butprovides long-term and highlyjustified payoffs interms&#13;
          of sustainability and improved governance;&#13;
      e   Open menus allow a better reflection o f local needs than do pre-selected ones;&#13;
      0   Highquality technical support to communities makes for better outcomes andlonger-term&#13;
          sustainability. Private sector providers and NGOs should be used where available;&#13;
      0   Community-driven projects should include a strategy for linkingupplanning and&#13;
          investments to district and provincial management, althoughthis linkage should be&#13;
          sequenced carefully, particularly inpost-conflict environments;&#13;
&#13;
12.       Three design and management lessons of special relevance stand out for designing the&#13;
project:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Advance clarification and clear communication o f all project eligibility, community&#13;
          procurement, disbursement, and financial management procedures i s essential;&#13;
          Technical support and training is needed to enhance quality o f infrastructure designs, to&#13;
          pre-qualify engineers, agronomists, and other potential sources o f support to the villages;&#13;
      0   Prompt and decisive use o f sanctions i s neededfor communities and project officials if&#13;
          they do not follow agreed-upon rules.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13.     There i s also a relevant set o f negative lessons learned:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Risks o f elite capture o fbenefits are high, particularly incommunities with pronounced&#13;
        class differences. Mitigation measures will include external facilitation, a focus on public&#13;
        rather than private goods, and an intense programo f outreach and transparency.&#13;
        Communities usually do not have access to formal systems o fredress. Community-based&#13;
        projects thus depend on transparency and social controls to prevent corruption and fraud.&#13;
        Support from civil society groups (NGOs, legal advocacy organizations, press, academics,&#13;
        etc) must be enlisted from the outset.&#13;
    0   Communities with long histories o f aid dependency or inareas o f extensive government&#13;
        service delivery will not easily provide large contributions for capital costs or maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
14.     NGOshave been actively involved incommunity development inAfghanistan since&#13;
around 1990, and lessons gained from consultations with these NGOs include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Communities should be given enough time duringplanningto ensure full understanding&#13;
        and ownership o f the process. However, with good facilitation, this understanding and&#13;
        ownership can be establishedwithin a fairly short time-span.&#13;
    0   Labor involved inproject implementation will require payment for labor or else the poor&#13;
        will notbe able to afford to participate;&#13;
    0   Community contributions towards capital costs inthe form o f labor or reduceddaily wage&#13;
        rates mustbe supplemented with other forms o f contributions (e.g. cash) from more&#13;
        affluent families, who do not have members seeking work at the reduced wage rate;&#13;
    0   Be selective-areas    that are inpractice controlled by militia leaders or single-family elites&#13;
        may have to be excluded from the program ifthey oppose the holding o f elections for&#13;
        Community Councils through secret ballot.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Lessons gained from consultation with the government include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Project designs should reflect a long-term rather than short-term vision, with a special&#13;
        focus on developingrepresentative forms o f local leadership;&#13;
    0   Capacity support provided to provincial and district government should focus on&#13;
        strengthening their planning, monitoring, and coordinationroles but not on&#13;
        implementation. Local government should be involved ina long-termprocess o f&#13;
        responsiveness to bottom-up demand.&#13;
&#13;
3. Lessonsfromthe current National Solidarity Program&#13;
&#13;
16.     The project i s a follow-up to the community driven development (CDD) component o f the&#13;
Emergency Community Empowerment &amp; Public Works Project (H009-AF), that became effective&#13;
inJune 2002, andthat is currentlysupportingthe implementationofthe National Solidarity&#13;
Program in87 districts in 31o f Afghanistan's 32 provinces. Program implementation i s managed&#13;
byMRRDwith support from an internationallyrecruited Oversight Consultant, who began the&#13;
assignment inearly September 2003. Communities are supported by FacilitatingPartners (at&#13;
present 20 NGOs plus UN-Habitat) inthe election o f Community Development Councils (CDCs),&#13;
planning and implementationo f sub-projects, and capacity buildinginfinancial management and&#13;
procurement. UN-Habitat started field operations inM a y 2003, while the FacilitatingPartner&#13;
NGOsbegan operations from late July 2003 onwards. By October 2003, the FacilitatingPartners&#13;
had identified 3,527 villages for the first phase o f operations, and community mobilization was&#13;
ongoing in 1,450 villages, with elections o f CDCs completedin600 villages, and 350 CDCs&#13;
engaged inpreparation o f sub-projects. The NSP Oversight Consultant has established its office in&#13;
MRRD,andintheprovinces where the first disbursementsofblockgrantsto communitiesare&#13;
                                                     4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
taking place. The lessons from the NSP, albeit still at an early stage, demonstrate that it is possible&#13;
to implement a large scale CDD program involving substantial facilitation at the community level&#13;
inthe volatile anduncertainsocio-political environment o fpresent day Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
4. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
17.      After nearly 25 years o f conflict, there i s a highneedfor large scale interventions to&#13;
address rehabilitation and development inrural areas. The acceptance by the rural population o f&#13;
the transitional administration depends inno small measure on its ability to deliver long awaited&#13;
assistance to rural communities across the country. Because o f its experience with supporting&#13;
CDDprograms inother post-conflict countries, the Bank is well positionedto support this program&#13;
inAfghanistan. While there are anumber ofsmall-scale CDDprojects implementedbyNGOsand&#13;
supported by bilateral funding, the support for the NSP through the project will vastly expand the&#13;
scale o f CDD activities. Inaddition, the NSP will build on and strengthen the operational&#13;
partnership between NGOs and the Government that was started for the first time inAfghanistan&#13;
under the NSP component o f the Emergency Community Empowerment &amp; Public Works P r ~ j e c t . ~&#13;
This partnership will enable the government to further develop its national CDDprogram&#13;
framework (the National Solidarity Program), while drawing on the strength and experience o f the&#13;
NGOs for implementation. Inaddition, the program will introduce andbuildcapacity to execute a&#13;
key feature o f successful large scale CDD projects which involve local level planningprocesses&#13;
withinpublic sector management systems, namely tight supervision of financial management,&#13;
disbursement, and technical standards.&#13;
&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
18.      The objective o f the project i s to lay the foundations for a strengthening o f community&#13;
level governance, and to support community-managed sub-projects comprising reconstruction and&#13;
development that improve access o f rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and&#13;
services. The outcomes will be (i)    the establishment o f a framework for village level consultative&#13;
decision making and representative local leadership as a basis for interaction within and between&#13;
communities on the one hand, and with the administrationand aid agencies on the other, and (ii)&#13;
local level reconstruction, development, and capacity buildingwhich will lead to a decrease in&#13;
poverty levels.&#13;
&#13;
2. Project Components&#13;
&#13;
19.      The project will finance four components (See Appendix 3 for project costs and&#13;
disbursement schedule):&#13;
&#13;
PartA: BlockGrants for communities (US$72.32 million)to carry out Sub-projects involving&#13;
reconstruction and development activities through a facilitated participatory planning process.&#13;
These activities shall focus on, among other things, community infrastructure, development o f&#13;
human capital, savings and credit schemes for women and disabled, and asset transfers for women&#13;
and disabled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4        The related NGO Support Project (TF051247) implemented by MRRD,and funded by a US$2&#13;
milliongrant from the Japan Social Development Fund(JSDF) involves 37 Afghan NGOs as implementing&#13;
partners infour areas (Zabul, Shamali, Bamiyan, Nuristan) selected to ensure equity indistributiono f&#13;
benefits between ethnic groups (Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Nuristani). By October 2003, o f a total o f 37&#13;
projects, 23 were completed, 12 ongoing, and 2 postponed due to security risks.&#13;
                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part B: Community Facilitation and Sub-project Preparation (US$13.08 million) to support&#13;
local communities through: (i)    facilitation exercises to establish inclusive community institutions,&#13;
and identify local development needs and priorities; (ii)    assistance for preparing sub-project&#13;
proposals; (iii)  assistance incarrying out sub-projects for which block grants have been made&#13;
available, and capacity buildingfor members o f local communities.&#13;
&#13;
Part C: Capacity Buildingand Implementation Support (US$7.6 million) comprising&#13;
provision o f consultants' services for capacity buildingin, implementationsupport to, and&#13;
incremental operating costs for the MRRD. These services will strengthen local communities&#13;
capacity infinancial management, procurement, and technical skills. The project will also augment&#13;
the MRRD's human and physical capacity to supervise and implement the project.&#13;
&#13;
Part D: External Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2 million) comprising external monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and studies to verify implementationstatus, assess achievement o f project&#13;
objectives/outcomes, and undertake researchon specific issues related to programpolicy or&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
3. Project Description&#13;
&#13;
20.     Project operational policies are described inthe draft Operational Manual for the NSP&#13;
The operational manual i s expected to be amended from time to time by the government, in&#13;
consultation with IDA based on lessons from implementation. The following summarizes key&#13;
sections o f the operational manual..&#13;
&#13;
21.      Approach: The NSP provides a single-window framework for village level reconstruction&#13;
and development activities. The NSP consists o f four core elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Facilitationat the community level to assist communities establish inclusive community&#13;
        institutionsthrough elections, reachconsensus on priorities and corresponding sub-project&#13;
        activities, develop eligible sub-proposals that comply with NSP appraisal criteria, and&#13;
        implement approved project sub-proposals;&#13;
    0   A systemo f direct block grant transfers to support rehabilitation or development&#13;
         activities (sub-projects) plannedand implementedby the elected CDCs;&#13;
    0   A series o f capacity buildingactivitiesto enhance the competence o fCDC members&#13;
         (both men and women) for financial management, procurement, technical slulls, and&#13;
        transparency, and,&#13;
    0   Activities linking local institutions to government administration and aid agencies&#13;
        with available services andresources.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Coverage: The transitional government intends to have NSP cover the country's estimated&#13;
20,000 villages over a four year period. Inthe first year, three target districts have been selected by&#13;
MRRDineachofthe 32provinces onthe basis ofvulnerability relatedto drought impacts and&#13;
return o f Internally DisplacedPersons (IDPs) and refugees. The target for the first year o f&#13;
implementationis to reachmore than 4,100 village communities across the country. Duringyear&#13;
two, operations will expand to cover the remainingvillages inthe initial districts, and/or villages in&#13;
new districts. Village communities that successfully implementedprojects duringthe first year&#13;
would receive a new, but smaller block grant duringyear two, and the same formula would be&#13;
applied in successive years. The goal o f the government i s to establish a system o f recurrent&#13;
transfer o fblock grants for all village communities o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Block grant allocations to villages will be based on the following three principles:&#13;
&#13;
                                                     6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0    One block grant (budget) will be allocated to each community at a rate o f U S 2 0 0 per&#13;
         family with an upper limit o f US$60,000 per community. This allocationrequires that the&#13;
         community develops one or more eligible sub-project proposals within the framework o f&#13;
        the block grant allocation and its own contributions. Annual follow-up block grants will be&#13;
         allocated at a lower per capita rate to be determined;&#13;
    0   One DevelopmentCouncil will be established for each community. Development&#13;
         Councils can not be established for sub-sets o f an existingvillage (e.g. a village can not be&#13;
         split into its constituent political or ethnicknship (qaum) sub-divisions);&#13;
    0   A community is a village ofmore than 25 families.&#13;
&#13;
24.     Eliaibilitv: Inorder to be eligible for a block grant allocation, a community mustdevelop&#13;
one or more sub-project proposals that fulfill the following criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Proposed by a representative Development Council elected through a community-wide&#13;
        secret ballot;&#13;
    0   Endorsedthrough an inclusive community-wide consultation process;&#13;
    0   Provides equitable access to benefits;&#13;
    0   Technically and financially sound;&#13;
    0   Includes an operation and maintenance plan;&#13;
    0   At least 10%community contributions inestimatedmonetary equivalent towards capital&#13;
         costs and full responsibility for operation and maintenance';&#13;
    0   Includes a commitment to and plans for ensuring transparency o fthe use o f block grant&#13;
         funds.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Open menu: NSP will use an open menu o f subprojects within four types o f investments,&#13;
subject to a short negative list (see Appendix 8). The four types o f investments are:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Community infrastructure (the investments will comply with definedtechnical standards,&#13;
         and will only comprise public goods)6;&#13;
    2. Human capital development activities (e.g., time-bound literacy classes, hygiene education&#13;
         etc., that will not incur recurrent costs from the state);&#13;
    3.   Self-help savings and credit schemes for women and disabled;&#13;
    4. Asset transfers for vulnerable women and disabled.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Inthe case o f sub-project proposals involvingrehabilitationor new construction of schools,&#13;
a condition for approval will be the endorsement by the Ministryo f Educationthat the proposed&#13;
school fits within the overall planning o f the ministry, and that the ministrywill cover the operating&#13;
costs of the school (fully or with committed contributions from other agencies). Ifundertaken,&#13;
rehabilitationand new construction o f clinics will require carefulplanning and coordination, since&#13;
plans (withdonor fundingcommitted for implementation) exist inthe Ministryo f Healthto provide&#13;
500 clinics over the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Microfinance: An assessment will be made o f lessons from micro-finance operations in&#13;
Afghanistan as well as other post-conflict situations and other social funds to determine whether a&#13;
simple androbust methodologycanbe developed, that would enable communitiesto use all or part&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5       The community contributiontowards capital costs cancomprise cash, labor, or in-kindcontributions&#13;
such as construction materials and transport.&#13;
6        Suchinfrastructure projects would include, but not necessarily be restrictedto irrigation works,&#13;
roads including culverts and small bridges, erosionprotection, structures promoting watershed management,&#13;
water supply facilities, micro-hydropower, and school buildings.&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f their block grant for micro-finance activities. This assessmentwill also explore the scope for&#13;
synergies with the ARTF supported Microfinance Investment &amp; Support Facility for Afghanistan&#13;
(MISFA), e.g. the use o fblock grant funds by communities to leverage funding from micro-credit&#13;
agencies, which will then be in charge o f managing repayments as part o f their normal operations,&#13;
and the use o fblock grants for community managed revolving loan funds (Appendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
28.       Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): To facilitate re-integration o f IDPs and&#13;
returningrefugees, villages with a considerable IDP/refugee population, will have the option o f an&#13;
increasedblock grant allocationifIDPshefugeesretumand participate inproject planning. It i s&#13;
expected that this incentivemay encourage villages with a highproportionof IDPs or refugees to&#13;
initiate consultation with these groups about their potential retum duringthe project preparation&#13;
phase inorder to obtain access to an increased block grant allocation. Where IDPshefugee families&#13;
or family members actually retum to their village duringthe sub-project preparation phase, a&#13;
reassessment o f the population size should be undertaken prior to final sub-project development&#13;
and costing to enable an adjustment o fthe block grant allocation. Where such planningi s&#13;
undertaken, the FacilitatingPartner should assist the community in assessing whether the additional&#13;
resources provided through the enhanced block grant and the proposed sub-project activities would&#13;
enable a sustainable re-integration o fthe returnees.&#13;
&#13;
29.       Nomads (kuchi): Before the conflict began inthe late seventies, the Afghan population&#13;
comprised an estimated 1.5 to 2 million nomads, mostly Pashtun. The population displacements&#13;
resulting from the conflict have affected both the settled and nomadpopulation, and shifts ininter-&#13;
ethnic power relations has restricted access for Pashtun nomads to summer grazing areas inthe&#13;
Hazara highlands. Inaddition, the increase incultivation o frain-fed wheat has made inroads on&#13;
areas used for grazing, and the drought has reduced animal herds considerably. Lessons from a&#13;
previous severe drought in 1970-71, which like the recent drought drastically reduced nomad herds,&#13;
show that these recover fast when grazing improves with increasedprecipitation. The main&#13;
constraint today to a full recovery o f pastoral nomadism i s probably the increasing restrictions on&#13;
access to pasture. The project will explore the scope for providing assistance to nomads, which&#13;
could include facilitation o f consultations between specific nomad and settled groups regarding&#13;
shared rights to land used for pasture, or facilitation o f access to social services such as healthand&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
30.       Community Development Plan and Sub-Proiect Proposals: Inconsultation with the&#13;
community at large, the CDC will develop a Community Development Plan (CDP) that prioritizes&#13;
the specific needs o f the community, andproposes sub-projects that address these needs. While the&#13;
block grant allocationwould enable financing o f one or more o fthe proposed sub-projects, it i s&#13;
unlikelythat it can address them all. The CDP constitutes amediumterminvestment plan for a&#13;
particular village, which would provide for the first time ever a bottom-up inputto higher level&#13;
planningat the district, provincial, and nationallevel.&#13;
&#13;
31.       Sustainabilitv: The NSP rules for community sub-project proposals require a commitment&#13;
to contribute a minimumo f 10% o f capital costs and a plan to cover the costs o f operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) o f community assets. Afghan villages have a `traditional' institutional&#13;
framework for voluntary labor mobilization (ashar) to create or maintainjoint assets, which can&#13;
respond to the NSP requirements for community contributions towards capital costs and O&amp;M.&#13;
Moreover, inthe case o f rehabilitation or improvement o f irrigation systems, which are expected to&#13;
comprise a significant share o f the sub-projects, `traditional' non-formal water user associations&#13;
headedby `water masters' (mirabs) exist throughout Afghanistan (although some have collapsed as&#13;
a result of conflict and population displacement), and undertake water distribution and maintenance&#13;
o f local irrigation systems. Experience from other NGO implementedprojects inAfghanistan (e.g.&#13;
drinkingwater supply) have demonstratedthat arrangements for user payment incash, kind,or&#13;
&#13;
                                                    8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
labor for maintenance services providedthrough the market have resulted inhighlevels o f asset&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
32.      Communitv Development Councils: Communities will be identifiedon the basis o f&#13;
existing local settlement and social patterns. However, this will not prevent different distinct&#13;
villages, whether small or large, fromjoining together to develop assets (e.g. a school, a pipe water&#13;
system, or a road) that serves more than one village. The CDC i s responsible for:&#13;
&#13;
         Overseeingpreparation o f the CDP with prioritised needs and sub-project activities that&#13;
         address these needs ;&#13;
         Convening community wide meetings to ensure community participationduringall phases;&#13;
         Overseeing planning and preparation o f specific sub-projects either directly or through&#13;
         community project management committees;&#13;
         Mobilizing community contributions;&#13;
         Presenting sub-project plans for appraisal;&#13;
        Managing and supervising sub-project implementationwith assistance from the Facilitating&#13;
        Partner agency;&#13;
         Overseeing (or directly handling) procurement and financial management at the&#13;
         community level;&#13;
         Reportingto the community and to MRRDon project progress and use o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
33.      Elections: The CDC will be established through an election conducted according to the&#13;
following rules:&#13;
&#13;
         Everybody inthe community who i s entitledto vote ingovernment elections i s entitled to&#13;
        be registered as a voter;&#13;
        Eachperson has one vote ;&#13;
         The voting will be conducted through a secret ballot;&#13;
        Both menand women are eligible to vote and to be members o f the CDC;&#13;
        Candidates and electioneering i s prohibited; and&#13;
         At least 40% o feligible voters haveto vote for an election to be valid.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Prohibition o f candidature and electioneering i s critical to reduce the likelihood o f elite&#13;
capture and intimidation, recognisingthat it will not remove it. To avoid selection o funwilling&#13;
candidates, community members will have an opportunity to declare (prior to the election) that they&#13;
are not preparedto accept the position ifelected. All members o f the community are eligible&#13;
candidates untilthey take the positive step to declare themselves ineligible.&#13;
&#13;
35.      To ensure inclusiveness interms o f different socio-economic, factional, and ethnickibal&#13;
(qaum) sub-divisions withinthe community, the election process will be based on a division o fthe&#13;
community into groups o f families (clusters), which will each elect one representative for the&#13;
Development Council. Since neighbours are usually also relatives, the division into clusters will&#13;
also reduce restrictions on women Cpurdah) and thereby facilitate their active involvement in&#13;
discussions o fthe qualities required for representatives and inthe election itself. The size o f such&#13;
clusters will vary depending on the size o f the village, but should generally not exceed about 20&#13;
families. The clusters would inturn serve as the framework for community wide consultations on&#13;
proposals from the DevelopmentCouncil, through a process where the elected councillors consult&#13;
with and seek feed-back from their electorate before decisions on priorities, sub-projects, and&#13;
community contributions are finalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36.       Where local norms regardingpurdah do not allow women to participate directly in&#13;
community wide meetings or inthe Development Council, the Facilitating Partner must promote&#13;
the establishment o f a separate forum where women can define their priorities. The Facilitating&#13;
Partner would also ensure that the priorities defined by women are discussed with the men, and that&#13;
those defined by the men are discussed with the women, so that the CDP takes account o fboth.&#13;
&#13;
4. MonitoringandEvaluation&#13;
&#13;
37.       Progress monitoring on inputs,process, and outputs will be undertakenby Facilitating&#13;
Partners andby the NSP Oversight Consultant, which will maintain a Management Information&#13;
System for the program and provide regularreports onthe overall program status. Workshops to&#13;
consult with Facilitating Partners will be conducted on a regular basis to distill lessons leamed and&#13;
adjust the overall approach and implementationarrangements described inthe NSP Operational&#13;
Manual as required. Independent extemal evaluation by a consultant will be undertaken to verify&#13;
the accuracy o fprogress monitoring conducted by the FacilitatingPartners and the Oversight&#13;
Consultant, and to assess achievement o f project outcomes against baseline data. (The project&#13;
performance indicators are described inAppendix 6 and monitoring and evaluation arrangements&#13;
are describedinAppendix 7).&#13;
&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1.InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
38.       The NSP i s implementedby MRRD. As a result o f more than two decades o f conflict,&#13;
exodus o ftrained personnel, low pay, and lack o f exposure to new approaches, the government's&#13;
institutionalcapacity i s generally weak. To address this issue, MRRD's leadership has over the&#13;
past year instituteda comprehensive reformwithin the ministry. The mandate, principles, policies&#13;
and objectives o fMRRDhave beenrevisedwith community empowerment at the core o fthe&#13;
ministry's work to ensure, that communitieshave boththe authority and capacity to own decisions&#13;
over their reconstruction and development. MRRD'sreformedmandate is policy and strategy&#13;
formulation, program coordination, programand project execution (involving implementation&#13;
through contracting partners -NGOs, UNand private sector), monitoring and supervision, and&#13;
information dissemination. The NSP and other nationalpriority programs managedby MRRD&#13;
reinforce the govemment's policy and regulatoryrole to support the private sector through&#13;
competitive contracting.&#13;
&#13;
39.       MRRD'sstructure at the nationalandprovincial levels has beenreformedto reflect the&#13;
functional changes with NSP at the core o fthe ministry. The overall goal o f MRRDi s that inthe&#13;
course o f the next three to five years, NSP will account for a large part o f the work o fthe ministry.&#13;
A new department - the Community-Led DevelopmentDepartment has been createdto manage&#13;
                                                                       -&#13;
the NSP, and other departments comprising technical support, livelihoods promotion, finance,&#13;
procurement, contract administration, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity development have&#13;
beenrestructured to support this core function. MRRDhas been committed to the principles o f&#13;
Priority Reform and Restructuring(PRR) even before this process was initiated formally, as&#13;
reflected by the creation o f the Community-Led DevelopmentDepartment, which i s one o f several&#13;
departments that are under the purviewo f the PRR.&#13;
&#13;
40.       Capacity development, a key aspect o fthe institutional strengthening and reform process,&#13;
i s a priority programmanaged by the Capacity DevelopmentDepartment. Resources from the&#13;
National Area Based Development Program support a number of strategically placednational and&#13;
expatriate advisors indifferent departments. Particular emphasis has been given to financial&#13;
management and procurement. Additionally, a management advisor i s allocated to each province.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff have been assigned to NSP inall provinces and an extensive training programbased on&#13;
"learning by doing" has been instituted.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Inadditionto theNSP, MRRDimplements three other programs, namelythe National&#13;
Emergency Employment Program, the Area BasedProgram, and the Microfinance Investment &amp;&#13;
Support Facility for Afghanistan. MRRDi s aiming to maximize synergies between these&#13;
programs, as indicatedby the current assessmento fpotential linkages between the NSP and&#13;
microfinance (Appendix 5).&#13;
&#13;
42.      The Oversight Consultant will be responsible to MRRDfor overall management and&#13;
supervision o fthe NSP. The NSP Oversight Consultant will have staff at the central level, infive&#13;
regional offices, and inall provincial level MRRDoffices. The Oversight Consultant i s placed in&#13;
MRRDandworks withMRRDcounterpartsinthe Community-LedDevelopmentDepartment to&#13;
strengthencapacity for community development and program management at central and&#13;
provincial levels. The key tasks o f the Oversight Consultant are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Appraisal o fcommunity project proposals;&#13;
    0    Management o f the NSP block grants for community projects (including effecting fund&#13;
         transfers, tranche payments, financial management, accounting, and reporting);&#13;
    0    Supervision o fthe performance o f Facilitating Partners;&#13;
    0    Planningand conductingtraining for staff o f MRRDand FacilitatingPartners (either&#13;
         directly or through sub-contracting), together with regular workshops to exchange lessons&#13;
         learned and adjust the program implementation approach as required;&#13;
    0    Undertaking technical and financial monitoring, and producing consolidatedprogress&#13;
         reports, and&#13;
    0    Management o f an informationand communication campaign on NSP.&#13;
&#13;
43.      FacilitatingPartners are agencies (Afghan and internationalNGOsplus UN-Habitat)&#13;
contracted by MRRDto assist inthe delivery o f the NSP to communities. Ineach province one or&#13;
more FacilitatingPartners have deployed community facilitators and technical specialists initially&#13;
for three districts to support the agreed target communities. Dependingon capacity, individual&#13;
FacilitatingPartners are undertakmg these activities inone or more districts, or inone or more&#13;
provinces. The primary role o f a Facilitating Partner is to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Facilitateelections o f inclusive CDCs;&#13;
    0    Facilitateconsultative community project planning comprising Community Development&#13;
         Plans and sub-project proposals;&#13;
    0    Provide technical assistance to develop sub-project proposals through either:&#13;
              o facilitating community access to technical assistance available inthe market or&#13;
                   from other agencies; or,&#13;
              o technical assistance providedbythe FacilitatingPartner,'&#13;
    0    Provide technical assistance to communities duringimplementation;&#13;
    0    Provide training to communities (e.g. book-keeping, procurement, contracting);&#13;
    0    Conduct monitoring and reporting.&#13;
&#13;
44.      The expected outputs o f the FacilitatingPartners are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I        While the preferred approachunder NSP i s for communities to avail themselves o ftechnical&#13;
assistance for project design through the market, it is recognized that this may not be feasible inmany rural&#13;
areas, and that insuch situations, technical assistance will have to be provided by the Facilitating Partner.&#13;
                                                        11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     0   Eligible project proposals (measured by the number o fprojects appraised and approved by&#13;
         the NSP);&#13;
     0   Implementationo f funded projects (measured by the number o f projects completed in&#13;
         accordance with design standards and ina sustainable manner).&#13;
&#13;
45.      Facilitating Partners are expected to recruit and deploy female field staff to enable&#13;
involvement o f women inthe targeted communities inthe prioritization, decision-making, and&#13;
implementationo fprojects.&#13;
&#13;
46.      p:PartnersandtheOversight            Contracts with Facilitating&#13;
Consultant are performance based, andrenewable on an annual basis. The NSP will hold&#13;
FacilitatingPartners accountable for performance against outputs, but will provide flexibility to its&#13;
partners inthe choice o f specific facilitation methods and work planning. The FacilitatingPartners&#13;
may use facilitation methods that they deem appropriate inorder to assist communities to prepare&#13;
projects that meet the eligibility criteria o f the NSP. The NSP Oversight Consultant will inter alia&#13;
be held accountable regardingtimely appraisal o f community sub-project proposals, timely&#13;
disbursement o f block grant installments to communities, and timely submission o f monitoring&#13;
reports.&#13;
&#13;
NSPgovernance&#13;
&#13;
47.      A SteeringCommittee acts inan advisory capacity to MRRDon overall programpolicy&#13;
formulation and direction, and oversees program implementation. At present, the Steering&#13;
Committee i s composed o frepresentatives from MRRDand Ministryo f Finance (MoF). An&#13;
External Review Committee consisting o f donors, UNagencies, the Independent Commission for&#13;
Human Rights,M o F and MRRDmeets on a regular basis to review and endorse all policy and&#13;
contractual issues. Discussions are underway to broaden the membership o f the Steering&#13;
Committee by merging the two bodies. An inter-ministerial committee has been established for&#13;
policy advice and coordination. The committee i s chaired by MRRD and comprises the ministries&#13;
o f Finance, Agriculture, Public Health, Education, hgation, Labor &amp; Social Affairs, Women's&#13;
Affairs, Public Works, Reconstruction, ForeignAffairs, and Refugees.&#13;
&#13;
Capacitybuildingfor NSP staff&#13;
&#13;
48.      Capacity buildingi s at the core o f the NSP, and the project will support this inthree ways.&#13;
The Oversight Consultant will train MRRD staff at central and provincial levels to buildcapacity to&#13;
eventually take over responsibility for management o f the NSP.' Duringthe course o f the proposed&#13;
Emergency National Solidarity Project, a strategy will be elaboratedto recruit (ifnecessary) and&#13;
retainhighquality national staff into MRRDand to develop the capacity o f existing staff to&#13;
manage the NSP. Broader capacity on CDD will also be built by involvingundergraduateswith a&#13;
social science or engineering background from Kabul University incommunity facilitation through&#13;
training by Facilitating Partners. Likewise, university undergraduates will be given opportunities&#13;
to participate inthe monitoring undertaken by the Oversight Consultant, and inevaluationby&#13;
extemal consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8       The JapanSocialDevelopmentFundsupports a project Capacity Buildingfor NSP Project&#13;
(TF05 1429) which provides U S $ l.1.48 million for capacity building within the NSP.&#13;
                                                     12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Linkageswith Sub-National Administration&#13;
&#13;
49.      Strengthening local governance requires buildingcapacity beyond elected CDCs and&#13;
forming meaningful institutional linkages with the sub-national government administration.&#13;
Recently, the World Bankhas completed a comprehensive study on "How Government Works in&#13;
Afghanistan" (World Bank, 2003). This study found that government administration i s highly&#13;
centralized based on the policy of a unitary state, and that this governance model i s unlikely to face&#13;
a serious challenge inthe near future. The study also found that, despite years o f conflict and&#13;
neglect from Kabul, administrative and fiscal mechanisms have continued inuse throughout the&#13;
country, although payment o f staff salaries i s erratic and often partial, and no allocations for&#13;
operating budgets are as yet made at the district (woluswuli) level.&#13;
&#13;
50.      The National Area Based DevelopmentProgram (NABDP) managed by MRRDwith&#13;
UNDP support i s designed to complement NSP by addressing linkages between communities and&#13;
government authorities through developingthe capacity o f sub-national authorities, to establish and&#13;
maintainprovincial and district consultation mechanisms to ensure that all stakeholders views are&#13;
reflected indevelopment planning and management. A twin-stream capacity development strategy&#13;
(management and technical services) i s on-going with MRRDprovincial management and&#13;
technical advisors assignedto eachprovince with international advisors providing technical&#13;
support. For the first time, a planning exercise has been conducted inall provinces identifying&#13;
priority projects above the village level ineach district.&#13;
&#13;
5 1.     The NSP faces a number o f competingdemands. Onthe one hand, its long-term goal i s to&#13;
strengthenlocal governance, transparency, accountability andpeoples' participation inthe&#13;
development process. On the other hand, inorder to establish its credibility, it must quickly&#13;
finance approved CDC plans that provide tangible benefits to communities. Without gaining&#13;
credibility inthe short-term, the NSP i s unlikely to achieve its long-term goal o f improving local&#13;
governance.&#13;
&#13;
52.      Strategy for LinhngCDCs and Sub-national Administration: The strategy i s based on a&#13;
phased approach that recognizes that NSP has some short-term goals. Linkages with sub-national&#13;
government should not act as bottlenecks to the quick and efficient approval and financing o f CDC&#13;
plans. The strategy also recognizes that government i s inthe process o f developinga number o f&#13;
programs to strengthen sub-national administration (such as the NABDP)and also to improve&#13;
service delivery insome key sectors such as health and education. The NSP therefore mustbe&#13;
flexible to adapt to these evolving programs; and the program shouldnot inadvertentlyduplicate, or&#13;
create perverse incentives that undermine the objectives o f other programs.&#13;
&#13;
53.      The strategy to be usedby NSP has three dimensions:&#13;
     0   Encouraging CDCs to create a demand for better services from sub-national government&#13;
         (district andor provincial).&#13;
     0   Encouraging CDCs to use their allocationo f direct block grants (particularly the Zndand 31d&#13;
        year allocations) to leverage additionalresources from provincial and district levels&#13;
        through the budgetary process.&#13;
     0  Encouraging CDCs to monitor the quality and timeliness o f service delivery providedby&#13;
         sub-national government.&#13;
&#13;
54.     The strategy will be implementedintwo phases. The first phase covers a short-term period&#13;
o f about one to two years. The second phase covers the period after that.&#13;
&#13;
55.     Phase 1: MRRD/Oversight Consultant representatives based inthe provinces will provide&#13;
the summary Community DevelopmentPlans o fCDCs (drawn from their MIS)to the district level&#13;
&#13;
                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
representatives o f each ministryand also the District Administrator (Woluswal)on an annual basis,&#13;
so that this information can be provided to line ministries intime to informthe annual budget&#13;
exercise. At the district level, these plans will be provided for informationpurposes only and no&#13;
direct action i s requiredon the part o f district officials inapproval o fplans or in fundtransfer to&#13;
CDCs. However, district officials may use this informationto coordinate the efforts o f aid&#13;
agencies operating or planningto operate inthe district inquestion.&#13;
&#13;
56.      Phase 2: After CDCs have developed some experience in implementingtheir plans and&#13;
managing funds, they will be encouragedto be more proactive indemanding services from district&#13;
government and inmonitoring the quality o f services delivered at the village level. Specifically:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   CDCs ina given district will be invited (by Facilitating Partners) to coordinate. This&#13;
         would enable them to exert greater voice on district level government to demand specific&#13;
         improvements inservices.&#13;
         CDCs can determine whether to use their 2ndand 3rdyear allocations individually, or as&#13;
         coordinatingentities, to leverage additionalresources from district or provincial&#13;
         government. CoordinatingCDCs could leverage resources for possible large scale&#13;
         investments such as roads linkingvillages or towns.&#13;
         CDCs will be asked (by FacilitatingPartners) to provide quarterly monitoring reports to&#13;
         district officials o f the Ministries o f Educationand Health. The reports will be simple and&#13;
         will essentially report on attendance o fteachers and healthprofessionals and availability o f&#13;
         text books, teaching materials and medicines. Report formats (e.g. Report Cards) will be&#13;
         developed by MRRDincollaborationwiththe Ministries o f Education and Health.&#13;
&#13;
57.      The modalities o f implementing the above strategy will be adapted based on lessons&#13;
learned duringimplementationo f the NSP.&#13;
&#13;
Implementationinhighriskareas&#13;
&#13;
58.      The extent to which the NSP will be able to assist communitiesthroughout the country i s&#13;
critically dependent on the security situation. Security remains problematic throughout large parts&#13;
ofthe country due to the limited extent o f government authority, and aid agencies face three&#13;
different lunds o f threats, namely from crime, inter-warlord rivalries, and opponents to the&#13;
transitional government (primarily from Taliban and the Hizb-e Islami). Since the summer o f&#13;
2003, attacks by Taliban have increased inthe South and East, and aid agencies have been&#13;
explicitly targeted as allies of the transitional government.&#13;
&#13;
59.      The deteriorating security situation may result in suspension o f operations by Facilitating&#13;
Partners inparts (or ina worst case scenario, most) o f the South and East. The options for&#13;
operating inhighrisk areas o f the country are limited. Some FacilitatingPartners operating in&#13;
these areas report constraints because they are not able to reach all villages due to security&#13;
concerns. These FacilitatingPartners use facilitators recruited from the district, who seem to be at&#13;
less riskthan staff from outside the district. However, in some situations FacilitatingPartners are&#13;
unable to monitor the work o f these staff raising concerns about the quality o f the planning,&#13;
approval and monitoring processes.&#13;
&#13;
60.      Indistricts where FacilitatingPartnerscannotberecruited, or mayhaveto pullout due to&#13;
security risks, MRRDhas proposed to manage the implementation o f the programby directly&#13;
advertising and recruitingmanagerial staff and facilitators. This staff would be placed with a&#13;
FacilitatingPartner for two months to receive practical training inparticipatoryplanning processes&#13;
and the rules and procedures o f the NSP. Teams o f trained individuals for a particular district&#13;
would then be establishedby MRRDand deployed.&#13;
&#13;
                                                      14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61,      Finally, inareas where security risks are particularly high,MRRDwould consider an&#13;
alternative approach to provide resources for reconstruction or development activities to&#13;
communities, which would not call for compliance with NSP appraisal requirements, and which&#13;
would be financed from other sources.&#13;
&#13;
2. BudgetandCo-financing&#13;
&#13;
62.      Programand proiect budget: The goal o f the Government i s to scale-up the National&#13;
Solidarity Programto cover all the estimated 20,000 villages inthe country within a four year time&#13;
frame. Total fundingrequirement over the four year period are estimated at aroundUS$781&#13;
million (Appendix 3). Fundingrequirements for the first year o fthis program are estimated at&#13;
close to US$161million.&#13;
&#13;
63.      The proposed Emergency National Solidarity Project i s for three years, but ifrequired,&#13;
IDAwould provide its entire contribution for the first year ofthe program. The project would be&#13;
funded by an IDA Grant o fUS$95 million and by co-financing from other donors for&#13;
approximately US$65 million. A number o f donors have committed to support the balance o f&#13;
US$65 million for this project.&#13;
&#13;
64.      Implementationconstraints may not allow the program to actually disburse funds at the&#13;
pace desired by the government. Therefore, the IDA-supported project has an expected completion&#13;
date o f September 30,2006, with the expectation that funds may disburse much faster.&#13;
&#13;
65.      The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund(ARTF)represents one mechanismfor&#13;
cofinancingo f the NSP. The ARTF i s one o f the main instruments available to the Government o f&#13;
Afghanistan to finance key recurrent expenditures (salaries, capital expenditures, operations and&#13;
maintenance o f key government institutions), as well as finance urgent investments and&#13;
reconstruction activities plannedinthe country's economic recovery program. The ARTF can&#13;
either finance free-standing projects or co-finance IDA or other Donor funded projects. However,&#13;
donors have expressed concern about ARTF as a mechanism for cofinancing o f NSP, since they&#13;
can not `earmark` their contributions for a specific activity inthe legal agreement. Modalities have&#13;
been developed by IDA, as ARTF Administrator, to allow donors to express preferences for a&#13;
priority program or project includedinthe Government multi-year development budget, and for&#13;
which the Government has requestedARTF funding. To maintain the integrity and principles&#13;
underlying a multi-donor Trust Fund, the ARTF cannot be used exclusively for the purpose o f&#13;
financing specific programs or projects. Donors who express a specific preference are expected to&#13;
also contribute to the general allocation. The amount for which the preference is being expressed&#13;
cannot exceed 50% of the donor's total contribution ina given Afghan Fiscal Year (Solar Year    -&#13;
SY). Ina non-legally bindingside letter to the Agreement, IDA will communicate its confidence&#13;
that ARTF will fund the designatedprogramup to the amount expressed by the donor, and this&#13;
amount would be transferred from the general fund to the specific project fund.&#13;
&#13;
66.      The government's preferredco-financing mechanism would bejoint cofinancing under an&#13;
arrangement where funds from different donors are channeled through the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
3. Procurement&#13;
&#13;
67.      Procurement under the project will be carried out inaccordance with the "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRDLoans and Credits" (January 1995, revisedinJanuary and August 1996&#13;
and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and Employment o f&#13;
Consultants by World BankBorrowers" (January 1997, revisedinSeptember 1997, January 1999&#13;
&#13;
                                                  15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and May 2002). Procurement o f goods, works and services will follow IDA approvedktandard&#13;
documents (see Appendix 1for details on procurement arrangements).&#13;
&#13;
68.     The Community Grant Component consists o fblock grant allocations that contribute to the&#13;
planned coverage o f the country's estimated 20,000 villages over a four year period. The block&#13;
grants will be used for community infrastructure, human capital development activities, self-help&#13;
savings and credit schemes for women and disabled, and asset transfers for vulnerable women and&#13;
disabled. The physical work will be described inthe approved sub-project contracts.&#13;
&#13;
69.     Works will be implementedby community organizations through a community-driven&#13;
process, incompliancewith para. 3.15 o f the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
70.     Goods estimated to cost more than US$200,000 or equivalent per contract will be procured&#13;
through IntemationalCompetitive Bidding. Intemational Shoppingwill be allowed for contracts&#13;
for goods estimated to cost less than or equivalent to US$200,000 per contract, and National&#13;
Shopping for contracts estimated to cost less than or equivalent to US$lOO,OOO per contract. Direct&#13;
Contracting will be used for goods estimatedto cost less than or equivalent to US$lO,OOO per&#13;
contract.&#13;
&#13;
71.     All contracts for goods estimatedto cost the equivalent o fUS$200,000 or morewillbe&#13;
subject to the IDA'Sprior review.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Incases, whereFacilitatingPartnersmayhavetopulloutofdistrictsdueto securityrisks,&#13;
MRRDwould attempt to directly advertise andrecruitindividuals for implementationsupervision&#13;
and facilitation as "Service Delivery Contractors". Facilitators recruitedfrom the districts in&#13;
question would be requiredto have the minimumqualifications o f basic literacy and basic&#13;
arithmetic skills.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Under the component for extemal monitoring and evaluation services, services o f firms&#13;
estimated to cost US$200,000 or more per contract will be procuredfollowing Quality and Cost&#13;
Based Selection. Services o f firms costing less than US$200,000 will follow the Consultant&#13;
Qualification method, and individual consultants will be selected on the basis o f their qualifications&#13;
for the assignment, in accordance with Section V o f the Consultants' Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
74.     Consulting services contracts estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more for&#13;
firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals, and any selection o f consultants on a Single-Source&#13;
basis will be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
&#13;
75.     The Facilitating Partners already worlung under ECE&amp;PWP will be continuing under the&#13;
project selected on a Single Source Basis. Their contracts are performance based, renewable on an&#13;
annual basis. Incase the performance o f any o f the FacilitatingPartners i s not found satisfactory&#13;
upon annual evaluation, the contract with that Facilitating Partner will not be extended further, and&#13;
a replacement would be done through selection o f another FacilitatingPartner following the&#13;
Quality- and Cost-Based Selection method. The Oversight Consultant was recruitedthrough&#13;
international competitivebiddingfollowing the Quality Based Selection Method. Inthe event o f&#13;
replacement, the same method o frecruitmentwill be followed.&#13;
&#13;
4. FinancialManagement,Disbursement, andAudit&#13;
&#13;
76.     Through the engagement o f the FinancialManagement Agent, the government i s ina&#13;
position to ensure proper accountingfor local payments. Inaddition, the government has also put&#13;
inplace aGrant Management Unitto manage and coordinate all donor projects, anda Cash&#13;
&#13;
                                                  16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Management Unitto undertake accounting for all income and manage cash resources under the&#13;
officer incharge o fthe Treasury at Ministry o f Finance. The government has also engaged the&#13;
services o f an international firm o f auditors to assist the Government's Auditor General in&#13;
satisfying the donor community regarding audits. These measures reflect the Government's&#13;
commitment to transparent and accountable financial management.&#13;
&#13;
77.      MRRDhas initiatedreforms ofthe ministry'sadministrative andfinancial functions&#13;
(including procurement and finance), appointment o f financial and procurement advisers, an&#13;
ongoing review and modification o f financial management and audit arrangements as well as&#13;
disbursement systems, and training o f staff at nationaland provincial levels infinancial&#13;
management and procurement.&#13;
&#13;
78.      FundsFlow: The project will be executedbyMRRDwith support from an internationally&#13;
recruitedOversight Consultingfirm. A key task o f the Oversight Consultant is management o f&#13;
disbursement o fblock grant funds, which constitute the largest component under the project. To&#13;
enable this, a specific designated account has been established for block grant funds under&#13;
management o fthe Oversight Consultant. Inaddition, a Special Account will also be opened at the&#13;
D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB) and, except for direct payments, this will be the main conduit for&#13;
payments for goods and for consultant services related to external monitoring and evaluation. In&#13;
case o fpayments to international firms (incl. NGOs and Oversight Consultant), direct payments&#13;
can be requestedthroughthe Grant Management Unito f MoF.&#13;
&#13;
79.      Responsibilities: The Grant Management Unitwithin M o F has the mainresponsibility for&#13;
preparingwithdrawal applications, taking steps to transfedmake payments, undertake accounting,&#13;
reporting, and obtaining audit opinions. At the same time, MRRDhas a Chief Financial Officer&#13;
who i s responsible for all these activities andwho will support the GMUinfulfillingthese&#13;
responsibilities. The ChiefFinancial Officer i s also responsible for ensuring that proper financial&#13;
procedures are followed inthe implementation o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
80.      Accounting Policies and Procedures: The Project will follow standard Afghan government&#13;
financial managementpolicies and procedures, including use o f the Chart o f Accounts developed&#13;
bythe Financial Management Agent to recordproject expenditures. The use o fthese procedures&#13;
will allow for adequate recording andreportingo fthe project expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
81.      Overall project accounts will be consolidated centrally inMoF's GMUfor all&#13;
implementing entities, and consolidated Project financial statements will be prepared for all sources&#13;
and uses o f project funds. To support this, the financial management department inMRRDhas&#13;
been strengthened, an accounting system has been set up for the whole ministrythat also includes&#13;
the NSP, and a detailed accounting system i s set up and maintainedby the Oversight Consultant for&#13;
block grant funds as well as the consultant's fee.&#13;
&#13;
82.      Audit Arrangements: The project accounts will be auditedbythe Auditor General with the&#13;
support o f the Audit Agent with terms o freference satisfactory to IDA. The annual project&#13;
financial statement to the Association would include a summary o f funds received(showing funds&#13;
receivedfrom all sources), and a summary o f expenditures shown under the main Project&#13;
components/activities and by main categories o f expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
83.      A fullassessmento ffinancial management, disbursement andaudit arrangements has been&#13;
undertaken and the arrangements envisaged for the project are detailed inAppendix 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
1. ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
84.      It ispremature to calculate economic andfinancialbenefits insuch a disrupted&#13;
environment. For this reason the NSP will collect detailed monitoring data to enable an evaluation&#13;
to make realistic assessmentso f the expectedreturns on individual subproject investments. Cost&#13;
data reported by NGOs worlung inAfghanistan suggests that the small-scale village investments&#13;
proposed under the NSP will have a positive return.&#13;
&#13;
85.      Beneficiaries o fthe NSP are expected to be the country's poor and near-poor. Sub-project&#13;
choices by villagers are expected to include physical infrastructure and revolving funds. In&#13;
addition, direct asset transfers (e.g. tools and equipment for income generation activities) are&#13;
permitted for vulnerable women and disabled people, and the use o fblock grants for microfinance&#13;
and income generation activities i s being assessedand may be eligible under the project.&#13;
Experience inother countries suggests that approximately 60-70 percent of program funds retum&#13;
to local labor, and virtually all o f the benefits from the physical works accrue to primary producers.&#13;
&#13;
86.      Total delivery costs for the program including costs o f Facilitating Partners, Oversight&#13;
Consultant, MRRDmanagement, training, and M&amp;E are expected to amount to about 20 percent o f&#13;
costs. This i s comparable to similar projects inother countries. Giventhe circumstances o f&#13;
Afghanistan, ifrequired, it would bejustified that an even larger proportiono f the budget be used&#13;
to cover delivery costs inorder to mitigate risks o f capture and to ensure quality o f the program. A&#13;
reduction o f delivery costs would be sought for subsequent phases o f the NSP.&#13;
&#13;
2. ProjectRisks&#13;
&#13;
87.      The context for the NSP o fvarying government authority inthe rural areas, a factional&#13;
mode o fpolitics and clientism at the village and supra-village levels, warlord rivalry and Taliban&#13;
resurgence insome areas, and low paid government officials who may receive salaries on an&#13;
irregularbasis, all contribute to create substantial risks for boththe program at large and for the&#13;
IDA supported project. Specific risk andproposedmitigation measures, some o fwhich are&#13;
elaborated elsewhere inthis Technical Annex, are listedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
 Risk                Mitigationmeasures&#13;
 Elite capture o f   External facilitation o fthe establishment o f CDCs through secret ballot and the&#13;
 benefits           participatory sub-project planningprocess. Focus onpublic rather than private&#13;
                     goods, and transparency inbudgeting and the use o f block grants by&#13;
                     communities.&#13;
 Corruption          Same as above, as well as financial management arrangements where MRRD,&#13;
                     FacilitatingPartners, and Oversight Consultant staff do not handle cash.&#13;
                     Transparency will be further promotedby the involvement o f the press in&#13;
                    monitoring o f the program.&#13;
 Delays inblock     Transfer o f funds and disbursement for approved community projects will be&#13;
 grant              managed by the Oversight Consultant, initially through the Hawala system until&#13;
 disbursement       it is determined on a caseby casebasis that a functioningbanking system is&#13;
                    established at the provincial level.&#13;
 Decreasing         Current strong support for NSP among cabinet members could seriously&#13;
 political          weaken inthe event o f changes inpolitical leadership. A strategic analysis o f&#13;
 support for        options for governance and management o fthe NSP will be undertaken to&#13;
 NSP                implement institutional arrangements that promote the continuity and integrity&#13;
                    of the program.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Decreasing          Deteriorating security conditions may prevent operations inspecific areas.&#13;
  security            Where this happens, and if feasible, operations may be shifted to other districts&#13;
                      within the sameprovince (as has already happenedinthe provinces o fZabul,&#13;
                      Paktika, and Uruzgan).&#13;
  Perceptions o f     Deteriorating security conditions as a result o f Taliban re-infiltration may&#13;
  inequitable         require suspension o f operations inthe south and east, which would inturn&#13;
  ethnic coverage     foster perceptions o f inequitable ethnic coverage. Proposed mitigation&#13;
                      measures include direct implementationby MRRDo fcommunity development&#13;
                      activities that would not have to comply with NSP appraisal requirements, and&#13;
                      that would therefore be financed from other sources.&#13;
&#13;
3. AlternativesConsidered&#13;
&#13;
88.      Approach and scale: The project is a follow-on project to the ECE&amp;PWP.&#13;
The Community Empowerment component of the first project has supported the establishment o f a&#13;
methodology for community driven planning, prioritization, implementationand subsequent&#13;
operation and maintenance o f sub-projects. This methodology i s derived from a series of&#13;
consultations involving MRRDand Facilitating Partners, and draws on the decade-long experience&#13;
o fthese partners with implementationo f CDD-typeprojects inAfghanistan. Duringthe appraisal&#13;
o f the project, considerable time was spent with MRRDto refine and simplify the approval and&#13;
funds flow mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
89.      Two alternatives were considered duringappraisal o f the project: (i)    financing the sub-&#13;
projects identified by CDCs usingsimilar approaches to those financed under the Public Works&#13;
component o f the ECE&amp;PWP; and (ii)       reducingthe scale o f operations o fthe NSP.&#13;
&#13;
90.      The first option was rejected because the public works component includes financing o f&#13;
larger public goods (road rehabilitation) that are implementedthrough contractors procuredthrough&#13;
National Competitive Bidding(NCB) by the government. However, an approach that relies on&#13;
public works contractors directly contracted by the government (as opposed to beingcontracted by&#13;
the communities) would be inconsistent with the specific objective o fNSP to improve local&#13;
governance through transparent collective action. Improving local governance requires that the&#13;
CDCs are in-charge of implementing subprojects that they themselves have identified, and are in&#13;
charge o f any contracting required to undertake the implementation.&#13;
&#13;
91,      The second option was rejected given the need for rapid coverage across the country, the&#13;
needfor development assistance to be perceived as being equitable by covering all provinces, and&#13;
the needto limit the proportion o fprogram delivery costs vis-&amp;vis block grants to be disbursed to&#13;
communities (a reduced block grant fundwould translate ina higher proportion o f delivery costs).&#13;
Initialprogress under the first project indicates that community demand for the NSP i s high. This&#13;
i s witnessed by the rapid increase inthe number of CDCs that have been elected duringthe last few&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
92.      Lastly, given that the project is a follow-on project, it was consideredprudent not to make&#13;
major changes inthe participatory approach, implementation modalities, or choice o f funding&#13;
instrument. Any change at this juncture would carry significant risks because most o f the&#13;
Facilitating Partners have already started working with communities and have started explaining&#13;
the rules and procedures of the project as part o f forming CDCs and preparing sub-project&#13;
proposals. Changes would have resulted inboth the Government and the FacilitatingPartners&#13;
losing credibility with the communities with whom they are working.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93.      POPPYeradication: Afghanistanhas emerged as the world's largest opiumproducer, with&#13;
productionlast year estimated to be around 3,600 tons.' An estimated 200,000 families cultivate&#13;
poppy providing an annual net income o f around US$2,500 per family, and wage rates for the&#13;
estimated 1million daily laborers involved duringpeak periods go as highas USSlO per day.&#13;
Thus, poppy cultivation plays a major role inthe Afghan economy, and a recent reportbythe IMF&#13;
suggests that the opium drugbusiness accounts for 40-60% o f Afghanistan's GDP." The opium&#13;
drugbusiness t h v e s ina fragmentedpolitical setting, and there are serious grounds for concern,&#13;
that those who profit from this business would have a vested interest inunderminingthe&#13;
governments state buildingefforts, or would command sufficient financial power to influence the&#13;
elections planned for 2004.&#13;
&#13;
94.      The government, with support from donor agencies, i s currentlypreparing an operational&#13;
strategy for poppy eradication. The strategy may include usingpriority sub-programs such as NSP&#13;
as part o f a package o f incentives to eradicate poppy.&#13;
&#13;
95.      Experiences from the early nineties onwards with the use o f community development&#13;
projects as incentives to wean farmers from poppy cultivation demonstrate that no single&#13;
development program can be expected to provide sufficient incentives for farmers to abandon&#13;
poppy production. However, if supplemented by effective enforcement o f a ban onpoppy&#13;
cultivation, the cumulative effect o f different development programs may play a positive role as&#13;
part o f a package o f incentives aimed at providing alternative livelihoods to farmers currently&#13;
engaged inpoppy production." Ifthe findings o fthe current assessment (paragraph 27 above) o f&#13;
the scope for usingblock grants for microcredit and income generation activities supports a simple&#13;
and replicable methodology, this would add another element to a package o f development&#13;
incentives that incombination with effective law enforcement, could support alternative economic&#13;
growth and employment.&#13;
&#13;
96.      Disarmament, Demobilization. and Reintegration (DDR): Started in September 2003, the&#13;
government's DDRprogram aims to support the demobilizationand reintegrationo f an estimated&#13;
100,000 to 200,000 former soldiers and combatants into the civilian economy. The option o f using&#13;
the NSP as an instrument to support the DDRprogram has been considered. The block grants&#13;
furnished by the NSP for community projects will provide direct employment and stimulate&#13;
economic recovery which will contribute towards creating a setting conducive to reintegration. A&#13;
more direct linkage could be established ifthe DDR or another program establishes training to&#13;
buildcapacity among former soldiers and combatants as artisans withinthe constructionsector or&#13;
to undertake small-scale contracting. However, a direct area targeting to accommodate the DDR&#13;
program would dilute the ongoing implementation o fNSP, since the NSP target districts have&#13;
already been selected on the basis o fthe Vulnerability Assessment Map and refugee return data,&#13;
and implementation has started inthese disticts.I2&#13;

access and map food insecurity. Under MRRD'sleadership, and with assistance from the World Bank and&#13;
other actors, the World Food Programhas broadenedthe 2003 assessment to include other dimensions of&#13;
vulnerability and has moved from an income to a consumption focus.&#13;

F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
1.Environmental and SocialImpacts and Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
97.        Sub-projects may comprise small-scale civil works which are not expectedto have any&#13;
significant negative environmental or social impacts. The Environment &amp; Social Safeguards&#13;
Framework (Appendix 8) will be operationalizedthrough the project's arrangements for&#13;
implementation, monitoring, and capacity building. Interms o f social impacts, the project falls in&#13;
the S-3 category o fthe Framework's Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements, and&#13;
Compensation, and it has a "B" environmental rating.&#13;
&#13;
98.        Environmental impacts: Activities envisaged under the project are not expected to entail&#13;
negative environmental and social impacts, providedthey are designed and implementedin&#13;
accordance with the design and mitigation guidelines inthe Framework. Certain types o f&#13;
investments with negative environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included&#13;
ina negativelist o fprohibitedinvestments.&#13;
&#13;
99.        Landacquisition: N o land acquisition i s anticipated. Inthe current socio-political context&#13;
inthe rural areas, involuntarylandacquisition basedonthe state's eminent domain isunlikely for&#13;
the kmdof small-scale activities that will be undertaken under the project for two reasons. The&#13;
first is, that local authorities do not have access to funds to purchase land or other assets ifland&#13;
acquisition were to be undertaken. The second is, that the political costs (interms o f opposition&#13;
from affected landowners/users) would inall likelihood deter the government apparatus from&#13;
attempting to acquire any land against the will o fthose affected. Ifany minor areas o fland would&#13;
be needed for a project (e.g. realignment o f an irrigation canal, or land for a school), such land&#13;
could only be obtained through either private voluntary donations, compensation paid by the&#13;
community (i.e. transaction between willing buyer-willing seller), or from available government&#13;
land. Private voluntary donations and community purchases would be documented as requiredby&#13;
the Framework, and for government land, documentation would be needed that the land i s free o f&#13;
encroachments, squatters or other encumbrances, and has been transferred to the project by the&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
100.      Ethnic minoritv aoups: The design for the project defines a strategy, which will ensure&#13;
that ethnic minority groups are included as beneficiaries, and that their concems are addressed in&#13;
compliance with the requirements o f OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. The key elements o f this&#13;
strategy are (i) project is national in scale and coverage, and consequently reaches all the&#13;
                  the&#13;
country's different ethnic groups, (ii)  the facilitated participatoryplanning process at the&#13;
community level includes an approach for electiono f CDCs, which will provide for representation&#13;
o f all sub-groups inthe community, (iii)   both internal monitoring and external independent&#13;
evaluation will assess the inclusiveness o f CDCs and thus provide information that would&#13;
constitute the basis for corrective actions, ifnecessary, and (iv) independent monitoringby civil&#13;
society (NGOs and the press) will provide another mechanism to identify cases where ethnic&#13;
minority groups would have beenbypassed or marginalized.&#13;
&#13;
101.      Cultural property: Chance finds duringimplementation o f sub-projects involving civil&#13;
works will be reported to the provincial or district governors, who then will inform the&#13;
Archaeological Committee.&#13;
&#13;
102.      Compliance with the safeguardprovisions and the negative list will be ensured through an&#13;
environmental, social and mine risk screeningprocedure (check lists) required for sub-project&#13;
proposals, and by internal input,process, and output monitoring, independent external monitoring&#13;
by consultants, andby Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
103.     Consultation and Disclosure. The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will&#13;
be disclosed by the government inboth Dari and Pashto, as well as English,and it will also be&#13;
made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. Extensive consultations have beenheld with the&#13;
FacilitatingPartnersregarding the NSP approach and implementation arrangements. Sub-projects&#13;
will involve consultations withinthe communities regarding(i) holding o f secret ballot&#13;
                                                               the&#13;
elections for representative CDCs, (ii)prioritization o fcommunity needs, (iii)&#13;
                                                                              identification o f&#13;
projects corresponding to these needs, (iv) development and costing o f sub-project plans, and (v)&#13;
arrangements to ensure disclosure o f budget and expenditures. The following information on the&#13;
project would be posted on the government's web-site: summaries o f quarterly NSP&#13;
implementationprogress reports, summaries o f annual project financial statements and audit&#13;
reports, and summaries o f findings from monitoring and supervision teams (after a reasonable&#13;
period allowed for internal review).&#13;

&#13;
A.      GENERALDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.      The project would support the Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan's (TISA)&#13;
National Programfor Reconstruction, bypromoting three o f its key elements, namely the use o f&#13;
assistance to create conditions for people to live secure lives and buildhuman capital, physical&#13;
reconstruction, and private sector development. This project i s a follow-up to the community&#13;
drivendevelopment (CDD) component o fthe Emergency Community Empowerment &amp;Public&#13;
Works Project (H009)(ECE&amp;PWP).         The project i s expected to achieve its objective through&#13;
laying the foundations for a long-term strengthening o f community level govemance, and to assist&#13;
the reconstruction and development o frural communities through a program framework, that can&#13;
form the basis for future development interventions by the state at the village level. The expected&#13;
outcomes would be (i)   the establishment o f a framework for village level consultative decision&#13;
making and representative local leadership as a basis for interaction between communities on the&#13;
one hand, and the government and aid agencies on the other, and (ii)   local level reconstruction,&#13;
development, and capacity buildingwhich will leadto a decrease inpoverty levels.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The goal o f the Borrower i s to scale-up the National Solidarity Program (NSP) to all the&#13;
villages inthe country within a four year time frame. The indicative fundingrequirements to&#13;
achieve this goal are presentedinthe table below:&#13;

three year period(Closing Date o f September 30,2006).&#13;
&#13;
4.      The project will finance four components:&#13;
&#13;
        Component 1: Grants for Community Projects (IDA:US$72.32 million)&#13;

&#13;
5.      Procurement under the Project will be carried out inaccordance with the "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRDLoans and Credits" (January 1995, revised inJanuary and August 1996&#13;
and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and Employment o f&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revisedin September 1997, January 1999&#13;
and May 2002). Procurement o f goods, works and services will follow IDA approvedstandard&#13;
documents.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1:Grantsfor Community Sub-projects&#13;
&#13;
6.      The community grant component consists o f Block Grant allocations to the country's&#13;
estimated 20,000 villages over a three to four year period with the goal to establish a recurrent&#13;
block grant allocationfor all village communities. One block grant (budget) will be allocated to&#13;
each community at a rate o fUS$200per family with an upper limit o fUS$60,000 per&#13;
community. This allocationrequires that the community develops one or more eligible project&#13;
proposals within the framework o f the block grant allocation and its own contributions. The&#13;
block grants will be used for community infrastructure, human capital development activities,&#13;
self-help savings and credit schemes for women and disabled, and asset transfers for vulnerable&#13;
women and disabled. The physical work will be described inthe approved subproject contract.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Sub-projects (goods, works and services) will be implementedby community&#13;
organizations through a community-driven process, incompliance with paragraph. 3.15 o f the&#13;
World Bank Guidelines, and will adopt the following methods:&#13;
&#13;
            Execution o fthe sub-project (works) by the communities themselves by employing&#13;
            labor and byprocuring the neededmaterials, following the community procurement&#13;
            procedures detailed inthe ProgramOperational Manual ;or&#13;
            Award the sub-project (services) on Single-Source basis to community organizations&#13;
            or NGOs, following the procedures detailed inthe Project Operational Manual; or&#13;
            Award the sub-project (works), estimated to cost not more than $5,000, to qualified&#13;
            domestic contractors upon inviting quotations from at least three qualified domestic&#13;
            contractors, following the procedures detailed inthe Program Operational Manual; or&#13;
            Award the sub-project (works), estimated to cost $5,000 equivalent or more, through&#13;
            competitivebidding,advertised locally, inaccordance with the procedures detailed in&#13;
            the ProgramOperational Manual (the threshold o f $5,000 will be reconsidered after&#13;
            6-12 months to assess whether it can be raised); or&#13;
            Procure goods under contracts awarded on the basis o fnational shopping procedures,&#13;
            as detailed inthe Program Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Incaseofemergencies or to complete any unfinishedworks without disruptingother&#13;
ongoing operations, the Force Account methodmay be applied.&#13;
&#13;
Component2: Procurementof Goods&#13;
&#13;
9.      The procurement o f goods will consist o f office supplies/equipment, communication&#13;
equipment, computers and vehicles. InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB),&#13;
InternationalNational Shopping (ISNS) and Direct Contracting (DC) procedures will be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10.      InternationalCompetitive Bidding:This will be used for goods estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$200,000 or equivalent per contract.&#13;
&#13;
11.      International Shopping: This will be usedfor goods estimatedto cost less than or equal&#13;
to US$200,000 equivalent per contract. Under Shopping procedures, simplifieddocuments and&#13;
procedures will be used for soliciting, receiving, and evaluating competitive quotation from&#13;
usually at least three suppliers from two different counties. Inview o f the nature o f this&#13;
emergency operation, the threshold i s set higher than normal limit o f US$lOO,OOO.&#13;
&#13;
12.      National Shopping: This will be used for goods estimatedto cost less than or equal to&#13;
US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract. Under Shopping procedures, simplified documents and&#13;
procedures will be used for soliciting, receiving, and evaluating competitive quotation from&#13;
usually at least three suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Direct Contracting (DC) Procedures: This will be used for goods estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$lO,OOO equivalent per contract.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: Consultants' Services &amp; Training&#13;
&#13;
14.      As already mentioned, the project is a follow-up to the community driven development&#13;
(CDD) component o fthe Emergency Community Empowerment &amp; Public Works Project&#13;
(H009)(ECE&amp;PWP).        The communities are being supported by Facilitating Partners (NGOsplus&#13;
UN-Habitat) inthe election o f Community Development Councils, planning and implementation&#13;
o f sub-projects, and capacity buildingon financial management and procurement. Due to&#13;
urgency, these Facilitating Partners were selected based on the Consultants' Qualifications [the&#13;
contract value ranges from US$0.26 million to US$ 1.6 million] with IDA'Sapproval.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The overall management o f the ECE&amp;PWP by MRRDi s supportedby an intemationally&#13;
recruitedOversight Consultant, whose key tasks include (i)   appraisal o f community sub-project&#13;
proposals, (ii)fundtransfer and disbursement for approved community sub-projects, (iii)&#13;
management o frelations with Facilitating Partners, (iv) M&amp;E, and (v) capacity buildingo f&#13;
MRRDcounterparts. The Oversight Consultant was selected throughQuality-Based Selection&#13;
method.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Contracts with FacilitatingPartners and the Oversight Consultant are performance based,&#13;
renewable on an annual basis. Based on the performance o fthe oversight firm and the&#13;
Facilitating Partners, their contracts would be extended, under Single-Source Selection, for&#13;
continuation o fthe same services under the proposed ENSP&#13;
&#13;
17.     IncasetheperformanceofanyoftheFacilitatingPartnersisnotfoundsatisfactoryupon&#13;
annual evaluation, then the contract with that FacilitatingPartner will not be extended further and&#13;
a replacement would be done through selection o f another Facilitating Partner following the&#13;
Quality- and Cost-Based Selection method.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Incases,whereFacilitatingPartnersmayhavetopulloutofdistricts dueto securityrisks,&#13;
MRRDwould attempt to directly advertise andrecruitindividuals, withthe minimum&#13;
qualifications o fhaving basic literacy and basic arithmetic skills, as "Service Delivery&#13;
Contractors", from the districts inquestion. The individuals can be placedwith a Facilitating&#13;
Partner for two months to receive practical training inparticipatory planningprocesses and the&#13;
rules and procedures o f the NSP. Teams o f trained individuals from a particular district can then&#13;
be establishedby MRRDand deployed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component 4: External Monitoring and Evaluation services&#13;
&#13;
19.      The project entails consultants' services for external monitoring, evaluation and studies&#13;
to verify implementation status, assess achievement o fproject objectives/outcomes, and&#13;
undertake research on specific issues related to programpolicy or implementation.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Qualitv- and Cost-Based Selection (OCBS): Services through firms estimated to cost&#13;
US$200,000 or more per contract will be procured following QCBS.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Selection Basedon Consultants' Qualifications (CQI: Services through firms estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$200,000 per contract may be procuredbased on Consultants' Qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Individual Consultants (IC): Individual consultants will be selected on the basis o ftheir&#13;
qualifications for the assignment, inaccordance with Section V o f the Consultants' Guidelines.&#13;

&#13;
23.           0   The Project Procurement Planhas been finalized.&#13;
              0   The Project Operational Manual including the Community Procurement&#13;
                  Procedures has been finalized.&#13;
              0   The format for draft tripartite contract between community organizations,&#13;
                  facilitators, and project unit at the provincial level o f MRRDhas been finalized;&#13;
&#13;
24.      Most procurement would take place under the Community Block Grant sub-projects, by&#13;
the Community Development Councils (CDCs). The community sub-projects would involve&#13;
small value procurement o f goods, works and services, expected to cost not more than $60,000&#13;
per contract, through simple procurement procedures, described inthe Project Operational&#13;
Manual. The FacilitatingPartner NGOs would provide training to the CDCs on the community&#13;
procurement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
25.      The remainingprocurement would be processed by MRRDwith the assistance o f the&#13;
Government's central procurement consultant, i.e. Crown Agents at present. The Crown Agent's&#13;
contract i s valid till August, 2004 and the Borrower has initiatedsteps to select a new central&#13;
procurement consultant.&#13;
&#13;
D.       PROCUREMENTPLANNING&#13;
&#13;
26.      A detailed procurement plan for the Project has been finalized. Procurement o f goods,&#13;
works and services shall be undertaken inaccordance with the Plan. Incase o f any modification,&#13;
the plan shouldbe forwarded to IDA for its prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
E.       PRIORAND POSTREVIEW&#13;
&#13;
27.      All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$200,000 or more will be&#13;
subject to the IDA'Sprior review.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Consulting services contracts estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$lOO,OOO or more for&#13;
firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals, and any selection of consultants, on a Single-&#13;
Source basis will be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29.       Except for the above, all other contracts would be subject to post-review on a random&#13;
basis duringsupervision missions and audits.&#13;
&#13;
30.       Due to the nature o f the operation under the project, the majority o f contracts will be&#13;
below prior review limits. It i s expected that the project will have about 4,100 small value sub-&#13;
projects. The project provides for audits to be conducted by independent auditors to be hired by&#13;
ministries or the Control and Audit Office (the Audit Agent o f the Government) for expenditures&#13;
incurred as well as asset verification. Inaddition, the projectprovides technical audits by&#13;
independent consultants for community construction works on a sample basis. The normal Bank&#13;
requirement o f ex-post review o f one infive contracts for a high-riskproject cannot be achieved&#13;
inthisproject due to resourceandtime constraints.Giventhe sheernumber ofcontracts&#13;
envisioned inthis project, the Bank's resource constraints, the mitigating effect o f the self-audit&#13;
and technical audits mentionedabove, we would consider the "benchmark" review level o f 1in5&#13;
contracts to be excessively large for this type o f emergency operation. However, MRRDhas&#13;
agreed to conduct these post-award audit reviews through an External Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
Consultant for a sample o f sub-projects and furnishthe reports to IDA. The Bank will review&#13;
samples o f these reports as per the regional guidelines. Inaddition to a review o f the independent&#13;
self-audit reports called for inthis project, Bank staff will conduct post-award reviews during&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;

H.OverallProcurementRiskAssessment&#13;
&#13;
33.     Although MRRDhas been executing a number o f donor financed projects, and has&#13;
contracted an Oversight Consultant to support management o f the NSP including support to and&#13;
monitoring o f community procurement, the procurement riskhas been appraised as highdue to&#13;
the post-conflict environment, the geographically remote and dispersednature o fthe works, and&#13;
the decentralized implementation. Therefore, frequent procurement review missions are proposed&#13;
(once every four months) duringthe project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
   FINANCIALMANAGEMENT,DISBURSEMENT, AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      The World Bank has gained significant experience and understanding o f the financial&#13;
management issues inAfghanistan from the implementationo f several projects over more than a&#13;
year. The overall assessment is, that though the country's financial management system i s not&#13;
fully functional, especially to manage donor projects, appropriate mitigationmeasures, general&#13;
and project specific, have been introducedinorder to ensure fiduciary financial accountability for&#13;
the project funds. Inan effort to strengthen key institutions, the IDA i s financing a Financial&#13;
Management Agent to assist the Ministryo f Finance (MoF), and an Audit Agent to assist the&#13;
Control and Audit Office. USAID and IndianAid assistance programs are financing&#13;
consultants/advisors to assist the D a AfghanistanBank (DAB) inlocal as well as foreign currency&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthsand Challenges&#13;
&#13;
2.      Strengths: The characteristics listed below constitute major strengthsthat would help the&#13;
project meeting challenges related to the financial management:&#13;
&#13;
    1. One o fthe greatest strengths o fTISA i s the commitment towards accountability and&#13;
        transparency inits operations, as this provides IDA management confidence inensuring&#13;
        the proper utilization o f funds. The measures to strengthen institutional capacity referred&#13;
        to above reflect this commitment and will help inproper accounting and auditing o f&#13;
        financial transactions.&#13;
    2. Through the engagement o fthe Financial Management Agent inMoF, the transitional&#13;
        government i s now in a positionto ensure proper accounting for local payments. It i s the&#13;
        responsibility o f the FinancialManagement Agent to provide the necessary support to the&#13;
        TISA inensuring all aspects o f accounting and reporting, including compliance with the&#13;
        necessary fiduciary controls.&#13;
    3.  Inaddition, TISAhasalsoputinplacecertain supplementarymechanismssuchasa&#13;
        Grant Management Unit (GMU) to manage and coordinate all donor projects, and a Cash&#13;
        Management Unit to undertake accounting for all income and management o f cash&#13;
        resources, under the overall management of the Treasury Department at Ministryo f&#13;
        Finance.&#13;
    4. By engaging the services o fAudit Agent, an international firmo f auditors to assist the&#13;
        Country's Auditor General, TISA i s able to further satisfy the international donor&#13;
        community regardingproper auditing.&#13;
    5.  One o f the specific strengths o f the project i s that this i s a follow-up project, and that it&#13;
        already has a number o f mechanisms inplace which will significantly reduce the&#13;
        preparation time. These mechanisms include&#13;
             0   MRRDhas initiatedreforms ofthe ministry'sadministrative andfinancial&#13;
                 functions (including procurement and finance), appointment o f financial and&#13;
                 procurement advisers, an ongoing review and modification o f financial&#13;
                 management and audit arrangements as well as disbursement systems, and&#13;
                 training of staff at national and provincial levels infinancial management and&#13;
                 procurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              0    Appointment o f a ChiefFinancial Officer at MRRD,who i s responsible for&#13;
                   financial management tasks related to the project.&#13;
              0    The contracting o fan Oversight Consultant for implementationand financial&#13;
                   management o f grants to village communities, which constitutes the largest&#13;
                   portion o f the NSP funds (approx. 75%).&#13;
              0    The Oversight Consultant's tasks also include management of transfer o fblock&#13;
                   grant funds to communities. Inthe absence o f a functioning banlung system at&#13;
                   the provincial level, this will initially be done through Hawala operators. This i s&#13;
                   an intermediate measure, and when it i s established that functioningbanks exist&#13;
                   inparticularprovinces, the disbursementofblock grants to communitieswill&#13;
                   henceforth take place through the banking system. Hawala dealers will be&#13;
                   selected based on criteria definedinthe NSP Operational Manual.&#13;
              0    The Oversight Consultant's staff includes a Block Grant Manager, and Financial&#13;
                   Management staff i s being engaged for each o fthe provinces, who will be&#13;
                   responsible for ensuringthat the financial managementrequirements o f the&#13;
                   Operational Manuali s compliedwith ineach o fthe provinces.&#13;
              0    The project has developed an Operational Manual with a section on `Funds Flow&#13;
                   and Financial Management' which covers procedures as well as internal controls&#13;
                   o f various aspects o f the overall flow o f funds, the fund transfer mechanism,&#13;
                   disbursement to communities, and fundmanagement at the community level.&#13;
              0    The responsibilities o fFacilitatingPartners (20 Afghan and InternationalNGOs&#13;
                   plusUN-Habitat) include facilitation o fcommunitymobilization and sub-project&#13;
                   preparation, support for sub-project implementation, monitoring and reporting on&#13;
                   mobilization, project preparation and implementationincluding compliance with&#13;
                   NSP transparency rules for sub-project expenditures. FacilitatingPartners also&#13;
                   provide capacity buildingon simple financial management inbeneficiary&#13;
                   communities.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Challenges faced by the project regardingfinancial management are:&#13;
&#13;
4.       The primary challenge i s the transfer o f funds to almost 6,000 villages duringthe first&#13;
year o fimplementation, and the issue o f the use o fbankingchannels vis a vis Hawala dealers.&#13;
Considering that there are no commercial banks operating at any significant level inAfghanistan,&#13;
most commercial operations are undertakenby DABitself. DABi s currently inthe process o f&#13;
reviving its operations inthe provinces. However, at present, except for a few large provinces,&#13;
the revival i s still inits initial stages. Inview o f the lack o fbanlung facilities, the project has&#13;
opted to adopt transfer o f funds through Hawala dealers. Studies o f the Hawala system havebeen&#13;
undertaken on behalf o fthe World Bank and IMF. The usefulness o f the Hawala system under&#13;
the present conditions was recognized, and IDA has accepted this method for transfer o f funds as&#13;
an transitional measure under circumstances where on functioning banking system exist at the&#13;
provincial level. The arrangements for usingHawala under the NSP are based on the findings o f&#13;
these studies.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The risks associated with the Hawala operations are mainly relating to (i) potential&#13;
                                                                                          the&#13;
use o f the system for money launderingoperations, and (ii)        to loss o f funds insuch operations.&#13;
The risk derivingfrom potential money launderingwill be mitigatedby only usingHawala&#13;
dealers who are registered with DAB. The riskregardingloss o f funds will be managed through&#13;
an arrangement as that usedbyNGOs and UNagencies who all rely on Hawalas for money&#13;
transfers, where all funds to the Hawala dealers will be transferred only after the actual delivery&#13;
to the destination and after proofo fthe delivery i s provided. (iii)    Another riskrelatedto the use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f Hawala dealers i s that there i s often no audit trail left o f transactions undertaken. However, the&#13;
project has developed systems and documentation to record all transactions ina transparent&#13;
manner. Under the project, Hawala dealers will perform the role o f fund-transfer agents as an&#13;
intermediate measure until a functioning banking system i s inplace at the provincial level. The&#13;
procedures for this are defined inthe NSP Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
&#13;
6.       The main component under the project i s community Block Grants for sub-projects.&#13;
Funds for these grants are transferred by the Oversight Consultant from a DesignatedAccount&#13;
maintainedby the Oversight Consultant. Fundsto the designated account are transferred through&#13;
direct payment by the World Bank. Details o f operating the account are given below, under the&#13;
heading o f Community Block Grant account.&#13;
&#13;
7.       All the other components will be funded either through directpayment mode or through&#13;
payment from a Special Account. The Special Account will be maintainedat the Da Afghanistan&#13;
Bank. Contracts by MRRDhave already been entered with the Oversight Consultant and with&#13;
FacilitatingPartners comprisingnational and international NGOs as well as UNHabitat.&#13;
&#13;
8.       All direct payments will berequestedthrough Grant Management UnitofMinistryo f&#13;
Finance.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
9.       No retroactive fundingis envisagedunder the project.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
10.      For accounting purposes, the Government's budgetingand accounting systems will be&#13;
used. The Project will follow standard Afghan government financial management policies and&#13;
procedures, including using the Chart o f Accounts developed by the Financial Management&#13;
Agent to recordProject expenditures. Ultimately, the GMUwill be responsible for accounting o f&#13;
all expenditures and receipts inthe Government's accounting system, which will be the basis for&#13;
preparation o freports to IDA as well as to TISA.&#13;
&#13;
11.      The Oversight Consultant has put inplace a computerized, tailor made accounting system&#13;
for the sub grant component o fthe project. The system will generate both financial monitoring&#13;
reports (FMRs) and statements o f expenditures (SOEs). While this system has not yet been&#13;
tested, it appears that it hasbeen designed to record all grant transactions and to generate periodic&#13;
summary reports for this component (including Financial Monitoring Reports as indicated&#13;
below). The systemwill be tested only as the first grant operations beginto be recorded during&#13;
November 2003.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Annual project financial statements to be provided to IDA will be consolidated centrally&#13;
at the GMU. The statements would include a summary o f funds received (showing funds&#13;
receivedfrom all sources), and a summary o f expenditures shown under the mainProject&#13;
components/activities and by the main categories o f expenditures. These statements should also&#13;
disclose a statement o f financial affairs at the end o f the year and describe all major accounting&#13;
policies used inpreparingthe statement. The project CFO will assist the GMUinthis regard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13.       GMU, which is responsible for the accounts o fthe Grant projects, hasnow been&#13;
managing a number o f Grant/Credit projects for last 9-10 months and has sufficient experience to&#13;
handle such accounting andreporting responsibilities. Ithas also developed procedures and&#13;
systems, which are inplace to ensure a systematic process o f disbursement. However, there are&#13;
still certain weaknesses inaccounting o f expenditures on a day to day basis, and these needto be&#13;
worked on by the Financial Management Agent on a priority basis. It i s expectedthat the GMU&#13;
will have a proper accounting system inplace to ensure day to day accountingbefore the project&#13;
becomes effective.&#13;
&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
14.      GMUis responsible for reportingto IDAunderthe overall supervisiono fMoF, and with&#13;
assistance o f the Financial Management Agent. However, it will be the responsibility o f the&#13;
project CFO to facilitate this process. One o f the reportingrequirement is submission o f&#13;
FinancialMonitoring Reports (FMRs) each semester. The reports will be preparedby the CFO&#13;
and forwardedto IDA through the GMU. It i s important that the reports are generated from the&#13;
financial management system available at MRRD. The Bank's guidelines for FMRs have been&#13;
provided to CFO-MRRD and the Oversight Consultant. and it has been agreed that, usingthe&#13;
examples inthe guidelines as basis, the project will need to design formats proposed for FMRsby&#13;
the time o fnegotiations. GMUshould also be consultedwhile finalizing these formats.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Itwill bethe responsibility o f GMUto ensure that the informationas contained inthe&#13;
reports i s inagreement with the information as per its FMS system. FMRs should show: (i)&#13;
sources and uses o f funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii) o f status&#13;
procurement activities; and (iii)physical progress. These will be submitted to the Association&#13;
within 45 days o f the end o fthe semester. Guidelines for borrowers on FinancialMonitoring&#13;
Reports on World Bank-Financed projects are available at the World Bank office.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Monitoring o f Outputs and Achievements: The project has a component for independent&#13;
external agencies to monitor the processes and results o f the project implementation. It i s&#13;
essential that the team contains Financialmanagement expertise who examines the effectiveness&#13;
o f FMprocesses being undertaken and comment upon improvements required inthese processes&#13;
particularly relating to the management o f Block Grants.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Formats have been designed for the Oversight Consultant's reporting on Statement o f&#13;
Expenditures, Advances on Block Grant Funding, and Three MonthEstimate for Block Grant&#13;
Disbursements. These formats are part o fthe contract between MRRDand the Oversight&#13;
Consultant. Inaddition, formats have been developed for progressreportingon the process and&#13;
outputs o f community projects for boththe Oversight Consultant and FacilitatingPartners (see&#13;
Attachment 1and 2 inAppendix 7).&#13;
&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
&#13;
18.      The project CFO, who is placed at MRRD,i s inoverall charge o fthe execution o f&#13;
detailed financial management tasks, including accounting, periodic reporting, establishment o f&#13;
appropriate intemal procedures and controls to ensure that project funds are utilized for the&#13;
purposes intended, preparation o f annual financial statements, and organizing audits in&#13;
compliance with the audit requirements under the Grant agreement. H e will function inclose&#13;
coordination with the Block Grant Manager o f the Oversight Consultant. As part o f the Oversight&#13;
Consultant's staff, the project will have a Finance Officer at the provincial level, who will be&#13;
responsible for ensuring compliance with financial management requirements for the NSP ineach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
province. The Oversight Consultant's Block Grant Manager and the project CFO will ensure that&#13;
adequate training i s provided to these officers to enable them to undertake their responsibilities&#13;
successfully.&#13;
&#13;
19.       At the GMUlevel, as the number ofprojects increase, and its overall capacity is under&#13;
pressure and M o F should undertake an assessment o f GMU's workload to ensure that adequate&#13;
staff i s available to manage its responsibilities effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
20.       The accounts o f the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f&#13;
the Audit Agent, with terms o freference satisfactory to the Association. The audit o f the project&#13;
accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy o f the accounting and internal&#13;
control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) the&#13;
eligibility o f incurred expenditures for IDA financing. The annual project financial statements&#13;
audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, would be submitted within six&#13;
months o f the close o f fiscal year, i.e. by September 22 o f each year. All agencies involved in&#13;
implementationand holding records o f expenditures would needto retaintheir financial records&#13;
as per the IDA retention policy.&#13;
&#13;
21.       The following audit reports will be monitored inthe Audit Reports Compliance System&#13;
(ARCS):&#13;
&#13;
           ResponsibleAgency           Audit                               Auditors&#13;
           MOF, supported by           SOE,     Project  Accounts    and Auditor General&#13;
           Grant Management            Special Account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.       Risks&#13;
&#13;
              Non-absorption o f funds: One o f the mainrisks for the project i s that o f the project&#13;
               not being able to absorb the funds at the scale envisaged. While not affecting the&#13;
               viability o f the project, this would extend the implementationperiod. While&#13;
               disbursement o f the IDA Grant may take place duringone year after effectiveness if&#13;
               the funds transfer arrangements function as envisaged and security conditions permit&#13;
               operations across the country, the three year project period defined for the project&#13;
               will mitigate this risk.&#13;
               Transfer o f funds to remote locations: As mentionedabove, undertahng transfer o f&#13;
               fundsinsuch a large volume o ftransactions does initselfpose a challenge. While&#13;
               the project has designed a system to meet this challenge, it has not yet undertaken a&#13;
               substantial volume oftransfers, andthe practical problems associated with such a&#13;
              major task are yet to be leamed and mitigated. Henceproject management mustkeep&#13;
               a close watch on this critical aspect and be ready to make the necessary changes as&#13;
              required.&#13;
               Custody o f Grant Funds: It i s planned that large tranches o f funds will be transferred&#13;
              to the provincial centers where the funds will be then be provided to nominated&#13;
               community representatives. As the block grant allocations to communities can be&#13;
              quite large (upto US$60,000 depending on the size o f the community) and&#13;
               considering the insecure environment in some of the regions, this poses a real risk.&#13;
              To mitigate this risk and ensure that funds are used for the purpose intended,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            disbursement o fblock grants will be made intranches based on achievement o f&#13;
            agreed project milestones. Furthermore, as long as Hawala dealers are used for fund&#13;
            transfer, they retain responsibilityfor the funds untilthe payments are made to&#13;
            communities at the provincial MRRDoffices. Thus, no block grant funds will be&#13;
            physically kept inMRRD's provincial offices. Finally, payments for local&#13;
            contractors or goods under approved community sub-projects will be made at the&#13;
            provincial MRRDoffice inthe presence o f the nominated community&#13;
            representatives, the Facilitating Partners, and MRRD/Oversight Consultant staff.&#13;
            This arrangement will limitthe amounts o fcashthat has to be transported by&#13;
            community representatives from the provincial centers to the villages. When a&#13;
            functioning banlung system i s established at the provincial level, communities would&#13;
            open bank accounts, and funds would be transferred to these. Payment can then be&#13;
            made by check to further limit the risks associated with transport o f cash under the&#13;
            present conditions.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The Operational Manual describes the above arrangements. Ifcertain forms and&#13;
procedures are found not to be practical and require amendment, these will be reviewed during&#13;
the workshops with Facilitating Partners scheduled to take place at least bi-annually, and the&#13;
required revision o f the Operational Manual will be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
24.     While certain aspects o f the project appear to be highrisk, implementationo fthe&#13;
mitigation measures described above together with regular and effective supervision o f the&#13;
project would reduce the risk to medium.&#13;

&#13;
25.     Financing Percentage: Since collection o f tax revenue by TISA has just begun and i s&#13;
sporadic, disbursement percentages have been set at 100%with the understanding, that MoF will&#13;
submit withdrawal applications on anet-of-tax basis. The tax structure o fthe government willbe&#13;
reviewedperiodically by IDA and decision made whether standard disbursement percentages&#13;
needto be set and financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Disbursement Method: Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment o f special account, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special&#13;
Commitments) with full documentation or against statements o f expenditures as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Use o f statements o f expenditures (SOEs): Disbursements will be made on the basis o f&#13;
SOEs for all expenditures under block grants; for contracts for goods costing less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 35&#13;

     ASSESSMENT OFMICROFINANCE, LIVELIHOOD PROJECTS,AND INCOME&#13;
     GENERATINGSCHEMESAS AN OPTIONFORCOMMUNITY SUB-PROJECTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.         The National Solidarity Program (NSP) has been established by the government to provide&#13;
resources throughblock grants for community managed small-scale reconstruction and development in&#13;
rural areas, and to promote more participatory and inclusive decision making and governance at the&#13;
village level. NSP promotes a new development paradigmwhereby communities are empowered to make&#13;
decisions and control resources duringall stages o f the project cycle. NGO best practices inAfghanistan&#13;
have demonstratedthat community-driven projects can succeed even ininhospitable environments&#13;
providedthat certain principles o f participatory planning and technical quality management are followed.&#13;
The NSP is implementedby the Ministryo f Reconstruction &amp; Rural Development (MRRD).&#13;
&#13;
Rationale&#13;
&#13;
2.         Microfinance (MF)' has proved that sustainability and poverty outreach are compatible goals, by&#13;
providing credit facilities to poor and vulnerable groups on a sustained basis and enabling them to&#13;
improve their standard o f living. This has been confirmedby the better social fund and multi-sectoral&#13;
projects that have included microfinance.2 Inthe past, social funds similar to the NSP have been used to&#13;
deliver microfinanceincountries where there were no Microfinance Institutions(Yemen and Bosnia) and&#13;
also as a means to encourage existing Microfinance Institutions(MFIs)to expand into new regions, serve&#13;
new types o f clients, and develop new financial products for the target group. The IDA funded project to&#13;
support the National Solidarity Program, includes an assessmentto determine whether a simple approach&#13;
can be developed for NSP block grants to be used, either partially or fully, for microfinance activities,&#13;
livelihood activities and income generating schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Scope&#13;
&#13;
3.         This assessment comprises a review o fthe microfinancesector                MISFAInstitutional Partners&#13;
inAfghanistan -both existingproviders3as well as anticipatednew&#13;
entrants. It will explore the scope for synergies with the World Bank              BRAC                       CARE&#13;
supported Microfinance Investment and Support Facility for                         Mercy Corps                FINCA&#13;

1          The term "microfinance" is oftenusedina narrow sense to refer principally to microcredit for tiny informal&#13;
business. Ths assessmentuses the termmore broadly. The clients are notjust micro entrepreneurs, but a whole&#13;
range o f poor clients who also use financial services to manage emergencies, acquire householdassets, smooth&#13;
consumption and fimd social obligations. The services also include savings.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4.       Inadditionto the above, the assessmentwill also lookat experiences with livelihood andincome&#13;
generation activities inAfghanistan and elsewhere to determine whether inclusion o f such activities inthe&#13;
NSP can constitute a viable and sustainable option for the utilization o fblock grants by communities.&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
5.       The methodology employed thus far consists o f secondary data collection and document review,&#13;
discussions with staff o f microfinance programs and livelihood projects, and with MISFA staff. This&#13;
Appendix represents an early stage o f the assessment, limited due to the time constraints and lack o f&#13;
recorded information available with microfinance service providers. It i s anticipated that the more&#13;
detailed review will be completed by January 15,2004.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Over the next two months extensive interviews will be carried out with all MFproviders, MISFA,&#13;
the Oversight Consultant for the NSP, and the Ministryo f Rural Rehabilitation and Development&#13;
(MRRD). Visitswillbeconductedto locations (includingvillages) where microfinanceprograms,&#13;
livelihoodprojects, and income generating schemes are already being implemented. Bearing inmindthat&#13;
Afghanistan i s ina unique situation, lessons learned from similar projects in other post-conflict situations&#13;
will also be drawn upon.&#13;
&#13;
Challengesandopportunitiesfacing the microfinance sector inAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
7.       More than two decades o f conflict have left Afghanistan's economic and physical infrastructure&#13;
significantly damaged. Inthe recent past, the situation has been exacerbated by severe drought and it i s&#13;
estimated that over a quarter o f the population are critically poor. Life expectancy inAfghanistan is only&#13;
46 years and the unemploymentrate i s estimated to be 50% or higher.&#13;
&#13;
8.       A report commissioned by the World Bank andpreparedby EnterprisingSolutions Global&#13;
Consulting inM a y 20034,suggests that inthe foreseeable future, micro and small enterprises will be the&#13;
most important source o f employment for Afghans. The report estimates the current marketpenetration&#13;
o f microfinance to be less than 1%. Access to financial services and credit i s a key constraint to business&#13;
growth. Financial services are needed for a range o fneeds: to develop entrepreneurial activities, to cope&#13;
with crises andto meet plannedexpenditure.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Preliminary assessments carried out by Save the Children (US) suggests that boththe need and&#13;
the demand for microfinance, particularly by women, i s extremely high. On the other hand, introducing&#13;
credit services will be complicatedby existing levels o f indebtedness5. CHF International, CARE and&#13;
IRC have found a highrate o f indebtedness among micro enterprise target clientele inboth urban and&#13;
rural areas. These findings highlightthe need for a range o f financial services, including savings facilities&#13;
which play a particularly important role inreaching the poorest segments o f society and improving coping&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The lack o f formal employment, the need for funds to invest inbusiness and other financial&#13;
services such as savings, combined with the historically trade orientedtraditions o f the Afghan people&#13;
implyan environment ripe for increasedfinancial services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  "Micro finance Providers inAfghanistan", Enterprise Solutions Global Consulting, M a y 2003.&#13;
5        It is important to analyze existing levels o findebtedness before giving a loan. While indebtedness might&#13;
prevent clients from timely repayment, depending on the client and the structure o f the loan (e.g. a longer&#13;
repayment period), MF could also help raise clients out o f indebtedness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  11.    Challenges confronting the expansion o f microfinance services inAfghanistan comprise:&#13;
         (1)           Political instability and lack o f security&#13;
         (ii) Corruptionandpatronagestructure&#13;
         (iii) Underdevelopedformalbanlungsector&#13;

         (vii)         L o w level o f education and rate o f literacy&#13;

         (xii)         Badpractice programs&#13;
&#13;
  12.    Opportunities include:&#13;
         (i)           Entrepreneurial spirit and traditions which are expressed inthe interest by villagers to&#13;
                       use block grants for income generation activities&#13;
         (ii)          Trade economy&#13;
         (iii)         Tradition o f informal bankingpractices     - e.g. hawala6&#13;
         (iv)          Interest being shown by domestic and international organizations&#13;
         (VI           Donor availability&#13;
         (vi&gt;          Willingness on part o fplayers to launch a coordinated and cohesive effort&#13;
         (vii)         The establishment o fMISFA as an apex organization for the microfinance sector.&#13;
&#13;
 CurrentMFproviders&#13;
&#13;
  13.    There i s reason to believe that though the development o f MFwill be highlychallenging inthe&#13;
Afghan context, the sector could take o f f ifthe challenges outlined above are addressed. What i s urgently&#13;
needed i s funds to grow the loan portfolio and further buildthe capacity o fthese microfinance&#13;
institutions. MISFA i s working with its 10partner institutions to address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(1)        Currently there are 12-15 providers extending micro loans (excluding very tiny micro lending&#13;
           components i.e. less than 100 active loans or $25,000 outstanding loanbalance)&#13;
(ii)       Total outreach i s somewhere between 30-40,000 clients and the outstanding loanbalance i s&#13;
           less than $1 million according to market surveys undertaken in20027.&#13;
(iii)      Most programs operate inthe middle andnorthernpart o f Afghanistan. Kandahar and Farahin&#13;
           the southalso have MFprograms. Nimroz, Hilmand, PaktikaandKhost inthe South are not&#13;
           covered at all and nor are Ghor, Baghlan, Samangan, Kunduz and Takhar inthe north. Within&#13;
           provinces, MFprograms operate inno more than 2-4 districts.&#13;
(14        All providers have multi-sectoralprograms, i.e. are more thanjust microfinanceproviders.&#13;
(VI        Generally, the MFexperiment inAfghanistan has not been well informed by lessons learned&#13;
           from MFelsewhere inthe world. Some NGOs active inthe country have treated MF as a&#13;
           charitable undertaking and are less concerned about sustainable financial service delivery to&#13;
           the poor.&#13;
(4         The majority o f current providers focus exclusively on the provision o f credit, though some&#13;
           require forced savings and a few promote savings.&#13;
&#13;
~~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6        Estimates of the number o funregisteredmoney exchange dealers inAfghanistan vary widely from 500-&#13;
2000.&#13;
7        BRACmakes up for 15,000 ofthese clients. This figure also assumes that national organizations such as&#13;
NPORAA,CHA and ADA contribute approximately 10,000 clients.&#13;

  Implementation&#13;
&#13;
   14.      The NSP will seek to buildon the expertise o f the micro finance providers, the experience o fthe&#13;
  facilitating partners, and traditions o f community management.&#13;
&#13;
   1. Microfinance Schemes -alternatives for implementation&#13;
&#13;
   15.      Discussions between the World Bank's MicroFinance Project and MRRDinMay 2002 concluded&#13;
  that there needs to be close collaborationbetween MISFA and the NSP for the benefit o f the Afghan&#13;
  people, particularly as bothprograms have some commonpartner institutions. Inaddition, it was agreed&#13;
  that microfinance funds involving onlending to the community need to be channeled through institutions&#13;
  which are qualifiedto undertake these programs, preferably through MISFA. The two alternatives&#13;
  suggested inthis assessment, take these discussions into account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(1)           Invillageswith pre existingMFIswithprovencapacity (as determined byMISFA), the&#13;
              amount o fthe block grant chosen by the Community to be used for microfinance will be&#13;
              transferred to the MFI. These funds will not be included inthe general portfolio o fthe MFI,&#13;
              but will be managedthrough a separate account exclusivelyfor disbursement to the community.&#13;
              The exact methodology i s to be worked out inconjunction with MFIs and MISFA.&#13;
(ii)          Invillages where MFIsare notpresent, fundscanbetransferredto MISFAwho will consult&#13;
              with itspartners to see who would bebest suited to serve the community. Ifit is established that&#13;
              microfinance services can be provided to the community inquestion, the funds will then be&#13;
              usedto help the MFIincrease outreach to include the community. Incase of the latter scenario,&#13;
              microfinance services will be implementedonly iffunds over a certain amount are committed&#13;
              to it. This amount will be decided collaborativelyby the microfinance providers and MISFA.&#13;
              Ifneeded, villagescanbe allowedto submitproposalsjointly andpoolfundsto achieve this&#13;
              critical mass. Funds will be channeled, administered and monitoredthrough MISFA. The&#13;
              exact methodology i s to be determined inconjunctionwith MISFA and MFIs. Funds will be&#13;
              divided into two portions. One section will go to the MFIto cover its infrastructure cost in&#13;
              expansion while the other will be usedby the MFIfor distribution to the community. The&#13;
              division o f funds will be determined by the community, the MFIand MISFAjointly and be&#13;
              dependant on the costs incurredby the MFIto expand services. The benefit to the community&#13;
              will be access to credit facilities on a sustained basis.&#13;
&#13;
   16.      Itis importantto keep inmindthat integratingmicrofinancewithinthe NSP carries significant&#13;
  risks if initiatedbefore adequate capacity has been builtinthe microfinance sector. Lessons learned in&#13;
  post conflict situations such as Bosnia, Kosovo and Mozambique demonstrate that microcredit can assist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
even the vulnerable and displaced to support themselves economically'. However, these experiences also&#13;
show that ifa `charity' or grant culture i s allowed to prevail, then microcredit will not only prove&#13;
ineffective, it will harm the development o f the (micro) finance and entrepreneurial sector. Inthe Afghan&#13;
context, to ensure quality, microfinance institutions need to develop the infrastructure and capacity to start&#13;
or grow existing programs.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The preliminary assessment indicates that it would be preferable for NSP to work through&#13;
existing microfinance providersbecause experience has shown that ingeneral it i s better to avoid creating&#13;
new institutionsgwhere possible. MISFA i s actively involved inhelping MFIsbuildcapacity and expand&#13;
outreach. It is anticipated that most o f MISFA's ten partner institutionsat least will be up to the task o f&#13;
coping with NSP demands by late 2004 - early 2005. The MFIsto be involved will be decided by&#13;
MISFA depending on scale o f operation, depth o f outreach, commitment to sustainability, and adequate&#13;
capacity. The fourth quarter o f 2004 should see the development o f a comprehensive strategy to offer&#13;
microfinance through pilot projects in 10-15 villages, spread out geographically across NSP&#13;
implementing districts, with a demand for financial services. These villages will be ones where MFIs are&#13;
already operating or are willing to start operations.&#13;
&#13;
2. Revolving Loan Fundsand Income Generating Schemes&#13;
&#13;
18.      Revolving Loan Funds and Income Generating Schemes are already open to women and disabled&#13;
under the current NSP Operations Manual. Access for the entire community to such schemes can be&#13;
introducedon a pilot basis inthe first quarter o f 2004. These would be project grants to a community as a&#13;
whole, but would be administered by the community as a revolving loan fund and used for follow-up&#13;
activities agreed on by the Community Development Council (CDC).&#13;
&#13;
19.      Initially, 10-15 pilots villages will be selected. Selection will depend on traditions o f communal&#13;
management o f community-owned assets and a demonstrated track record o f the FacilitatingPartners'&#13;
success with similar schemes. Clear indicators to determine prior experience incommunal management&#13;
bythe community and success o fthe FPwill be determined inconjunction with the FacilitatingPartners.&#13;
Indicators for community management could include functioningtraditional communal management o f&#13;
irrigation systems (mirab system), andjoint decision-making regardingzakaat funds collected by&#13;
mosques. These experiences ensure thatjoint management i s not a new idea being introduced.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Experience on the part o f the FacilitatingPartner is necessary to develop sustainable oversight&#13;
and maintenance procedures to continue after it withdraws. Indicatorsto gauge experience will be&#13;
developed inconjunction with the Facilitating Partners themselves and will include the number o f similar&#13;
projects managed inthe past, sustainability o f these projects, experience inestablishing oversight and&#13;
maintenance procedures etc. These prior experiences on the part o fboththe community and the&#13;
Facilitating Partners will be built upon to ensure against elite capture o f community-owned assets or&#13;
fraud.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Inthe initial pilotphase (first quarter o f2004), these schemes wouldinvolve the establishmentof&#13;
a revolving loan fund from the amount the community selects to use for this purpose from its block grant.&#13;
As with other sub-projects, a community contribution o f 10% would be required. This loanfundwould&#13;
be used for income generating activities decided upon and managed by the CDC. The Facilitating Partner&#13;
will supervise establishment o f sustainable oversight and management bytraining andhelpingthe&#13;

community build capacity. Loanrepayment and profits generated (ifany) would be managedby the CDC&#13;
and usedfor second generation activities, whether community infrastructure, new revolving fund loans&#13;
for income generation, or community welfare activities such as literacy classes. The exact methodology i s&#13;
to be worked out inconjunctionwith FacilitatingPartners.&#13;
&#13;
22.       Based on lessons learned inthese pilots, activities may be expanded to villages where&#13;
FacilitatingPartner have no prior record of implementing Revolving LoanFunds and Income Generating&#13;
Schemes duringthe second quarter o f 2004. Inthe third quarter o f 2004, a comprehensive review should&#13;
be conducted to determine whether these schemes can be offered on an enlarged scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.      To avoid elite capture or fraud, the design for this type o f activities must establish checks and&#13;
balances as well as community management procedures that enable effective use o f social controls. A&#13;
detailed supervision plan that Facilitating Partnersneed to follow i s required, as experience with other&#13;
decentralized, community-based, poverty reductionprojects" have proved the role o f the facilitator to be&#13;
critical not only for start upbut also for follow-up and reinforcement.&#13;
&#13;
Loansversus Grants&#13;
&#13;
24.      This assessmentwill also draw up an initial list o fproposed community projectsand distinguish&#13;
their eligibility for loans (microfinance) or grants (income generating/ livelihoods). The list o fprojects&#13;
will be compiledbased onpreliminary findingso f Facilitating Partners regardingprojects that&#13;
communities express an interest in. This list i s expected to be dynamic as NSP expands and communities&#13;
come up with varying requests.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Broadly speahng, infrastructure projects are usually public goods and therefore eligible for&#13;
grants, whereas income generating projects will needto be assessedon a case by case basis to determine&#13;
whether CDCs envision that the asset inquestion will be a public or private good. Private goods (e.g. a&#13;
tractor or truck) will not be eligible to receive grant fundingfrom the NSP block grants, but mightqualify&#13;
as loans channeled through a microfinance institution, or as a second generation loan from a revolving&#13;
fundmanagedby a CDC . However, anumber o fprojects straddlethe linebetweenpublic infrastructure&#13;
and income generation. Examples are hydro-electric facilities and flour mills. Ifjointly managed by the&#13;
community, both o fthese activities would be eligible for block grant fundingunder the current NSP&#13;
guidelines, but ifprivately held and managed as an enterprise, they would currently not be eligible untila&#13;
methodology i s inplace, that provides for use o f block grants for microfinance loans.&#13;

             a detailed methodology for introducing livelihood schemes and income generating projects&#13;
             into the NSP inthe first quarter o f 2004. This methodology will be determined in&#13;

&#13;
                           MONITORING AND EVALUATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            The NSP's monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system i s intended to provide adequate information&#13;
            to the relevant stakeholders on project implementationperformance, process, outputs, and&#13;
            outcomes. The mainpurpose o f the monitoring system i s to provide timely feedback to key&#13;
            stakeholders, so that lessons can be leamed on a real time basis and mid-course corrective action&#13;
            initiated where necessary. The M&amp;E system has four components: (i)         implementationmonitoring&#13;
            -physical/financial; (ii) process monitoring; (iii) post-implementation monitoring, including&#13;
            sustainability monitoring o f completed sub-projects and audits; and (iv) outcome evaluation. A&#13;
            computerized MIS system will ensure that information flow takes place smoothly at all levels,&#13;
            and that data are electronically processed from provincial level upwards.&#13;
&#13;
-momtonng.:                               At the village level, communities will assisted bytheir Facilitating&#13;
            Partner to monitor their own progress based on a few self-selected key indicators (e.g. on&#13;
            process/participation, implementationprogress/results, and expenditures). Simple formats will be&#13;
            developed for this purpose and maintainedat the villageiFP level. The effort would be to widely&#13;
            display and communicate the results o f such monitoring within the village. At the next level, the&#13;
            Facilitating Partner, usingthe village as the basic unit o f monitoring, will provide a&#13;
            comprehensive report, including physical (and other outputs) and financial progress, on a&#13;
            quarterly basis to the NSP-Province office. The FacilitatingPartner's quarterly report will&#13;
            include the findings o f the community monitoring. A briefer, summary report on the status o f&#13;
            implementation will be submitted on a monthly basis (Attachment 1below).&#13;
&#13;
            The Facilitating Partner's quarterly progress reports will cover the district(s) or province(s) in&#13;
            which the particular Facilitating Partner i s responsible for facilitation of the NSP. Where more&#13;
than one Facilitating Partner i s involved infacilitation ina particularprovince, their reports will&#13;
            be aggregated at the NSP-Provincelevel. Provincial quarterly progress reports will then be&#13;
            aggregated at the national level by MRRD/Oversight Consultant (Attachment 2). At the national&#13;
            level, quarterly progress reports for the project as a whole will be generated and shared with key&#13;
            stakeholders, including the NSP Steering Committee, Facilitating Partners, and donor agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring data for aggregated reporting for the provincial level will be entered into a&#13;
            standardized electronic MIS, and the flow o f monitoring information and findings deriving from&#13;
           this informationcanbe depicted as follows:&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Post-imulementation monitoring: The purpose i s primarily to determine whether communities&#13;
are operating and maintaining their facilities ina sustainable manner. This will be carriedout&#13;
through random sample monitoring by the Oversight Consultant three months and six months&#13;
after sub-projects are completed ina particular village, and through external evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Process monitoring: Process indicators are included inthe FacilitatingPartners' quarterly&#13;
progress report. Inaddition, MRRD/Oversight Consultant will separately conduct, on a sample&#13;
basis, a bi-annual process monitoring exercise. This will involve the hiringo f an external agency&#13;
to spendsignificant time inthe field to monitor key processes at the village level, make cross-&#13;
village/province comparisons and suggest remedial action where required.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation: To evaluate project outcomes interms o f assessing whether the NSP i s meeting its&#13;
Program Objectives, key performance indicators have been developed (Appendix 6).&#13;
Achievements against these will be evaluated on a bi-annual basis by an external evaluation&#13;
consultant. Inaddition, regular supervision, and a mid-term review will be conductedby IDA.&#13;
At the end o fthe projectperiod, IDAwill produce an ImplementationCompletion Report, which&#13;
focuses on evaluating whether the project objectives and targets for key performance indicators&#13;
have been met.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional arrangements for M&amp;E: The M&amp;Esystem will be managedby MRRD/Oversight&#13;
Consultant at the provincial level and national level with inputsfrom FacilitatingPartners. While&#13;
it is expected that the MRRD/Oversight Consultant staff at the provincial level will frequently&#13;
make village visits, it is important to stress that senior personnel from MRRD/Oversight&#13;
Consultant's HQand the NSP Steering Committee should also go to the field periodically, to get&#13;
better acquainted with ground realities. MRRD/Oversight Consultant will also holdmeetings and&#13;
workshops with FacilitatingPartners (at least quarterly) to share the results o f monitoring and&#13;
receive feedback from them. The monitoring system and the NSP OperationalManual will thus&#13;
be periodically updated and improved, malung both live instruments for improving project&#13;
performance.&#13;

&#13;
    ENVIRONMENTAL &amp; SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE&#13;
                            NATIONAL SOLIDARITY PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       The proposedNational Solidarity Project would support the Transitional Islamic State o f&#13;
Afghanistan's National Programme for Reconstruction, by promotingthree o f its key elements,&#13;
namely the use o f assistance to create conditions for people to live secure lives and buildhuman&#13;
capital, physical reconstruction, and private sector development. The project would constitute&#13;
one o f the six nationalpriority sub-programs- the National Solidarity Program (NSP) -under one&#13;
o f the 12 National Development Programs: Livelihoods and Social Protection. The key&#13;
development issues addressed by the project are:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   Ruralreconstruction: More than two decades o f conflict have resulted inextensive&#13;
         destruction o finfrastructure and massive population displacements. A severe drought&#13;
         lasting from 1999 till 2002 has further increasedrural poverty, depleted available assets,&#13;
         and led to further displacements. The project will provide resources through block grants&#13;
         to rural communities for investments inreconstruction or development activities planned&#13;
         and managed by the communities themselves. Activities will either be implemented&#13;
         directly by the communities or through sub-contracting to the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
     0   Strengthening o f local governance: Decisions on the use o f block grants will be made&#13;
         through an inclusiveparticipatory decisionmalung process ledby community&#13;
         development councils elected through secret ballot. This process will facilitate the&#13;
         emergence o f consultative decision making and legitimate local leadership, which can&#13;
         form the basis for relations between communities and the local govemment apparatus&#13;
         including other assistance programs.&#13;
&#13;
     0   Enhancing govemment effectiveness: Capacity would be built within Ministry of&#13;
         Rehabilitation&amp; Rural Development (MRRD) to supervise the standards andprocedures&#13;
         for financial management, disbursement, social and environmental management and&#13;
         community projects that would be a requirement for the local level planning and&#13;
         management o fblock grants, which i s the core o f the NSP.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The project i s a follow-up to the community driven development (CDD) component o f&#13;
the Emergency Community Empowerment &amp; Public Works Project (H009), that became effective&#13;
inJune, 2002, andthat is currently under implementationin87 districts in31ofthe country's 32&#13;
provinces. The current NSP project has demonstrated, that despite a volatile security situation&#13;
and limited government authority inmuch o fthe rural areas, it has beenpossible to launch a large&#13;
scale CDD project across the country.&#13;
&#13;
Project Objective&#13;
&#13;
3.       The objective o f the project is to lay the foundations for a long-term strengthening o f&#13;
community level governance, and to assist the reconstruction and development o frural&#13;
communities through a program framework, that can form the basis for future development&#13;
interventions by the state at the village level. The outcomes will be (i)  the establishment o f a&#13;
framework for village level consultative decision making and representative local leadership as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
basis for interaction between communities on the one hand, and the government and aid agencies&#13;
on the other, and (ii)  local level reconstruction, development, and capacity buildingwhich will&#13;
lead to a decrease inpoverty levels.&#13;

4.        The goal o f the Government i s to scale-up the NSP to cover all the estimated 20,000&#13;
villages inthe country within a four year time frame. This would require fundingduringthe first&#13;
year o fimplementationo fUS$160 million, and a total fundingrequirement over the four year&#13;
period o f around U S 7 8 0 million. The project to be supported by IDA would contribute to&#13;
achieve the targets o f the larger program, and would be funded through an IDA Grant o fUS$95&#13;
million plusestimated co-financing o f US$65 million from other donors. While the IDA&#13;
supported project would be for three years, it would at the same time support the achievement o f&#13;
the first year implementationtarget.&#13;
&#13;
5.        The project will finance four components: Component 1: Grants for Community&#13;
Projects(US$73.52 million)comprises block grants to communities for reconstruction and&#13;
development activities selected by the communities through a facilitated participatory planning&#13;
process with elected Community Development Councils. Component 2: Goods (US$1.1&#13;
million)comprises additional equipmentfor MRRDsuch as vehicles, radio equipment,&#13;
computers, and furniture for field offices Component3: ConsultantServices andTraining&#13;
(US$18.38 million)comprises implementationsupport and capacity buildingby Facilitating&#13;
Partners to communities and by the NSP Oversight Consultant to MRRDand Facilitating&#13;
Partners. Component4: ExternalMonitoringandEvaluation(US$2 million) comprises&#13;
external monitoring, evaluation and studies to verify implementationstatus, assess achievement&#13;
o fproject objectives/outcomes, and undertake research on specific issues relatedto program&#13;
policy or implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Potentialimpactsofvarious components&#13;
&#13;
6.        Activities envisaged under the project should not entail significant and negative&#13;
environmental and social impacts, provided they are designed and implementedwith due&#13;
consideration o f environmental and social issues. Rather, most sub-projects envisaged under the&#13;
project should contribute to improving environmental and social conditions inrural Afghanistan.&#13;
Adverse impacts may arise due to depletion or degradation o f natural resources such as stone,&#13;
earth, water etc. used for construction o f small-scale infrastructure. Construction activities may&#13;
cause limited, temporary, and localizednegative impacts that can be mitigatedthrough the&#13;
implementation o f an appropriate social and environmental management plan. Certain types o f&#13;
investments with negative environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included&#13;
inanegative list ofprohibitedinvestments. Interms ofsocial impacts, theprojectfalls inthe S-3&#13;
category o fthe Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements, and Compensation&#13;
(Attachment 3).&#13;
&#13;
7.        No landacquisition is anticipated. Inthe current socio-political context inthe rural areas,&#13;
involuntary land acquisition i s unlikely for the kindo f small-scale activities that will be&#13;
undertakenunder the project for two reasons. The first is, that local authorities do not have&#13;
access to funds to purchase land or other assets ifland acquisitionwere to be undertaken. The&#13;
second is, that the political costs (interms o f opposition from affected landownershsers) would&#13;
inalllikelihooddeter the government apparatus fromattempting to acquire any landagainst the&#13;
will o fthose affected. Ifany minor areas o flandwould be neededfor a project (e.g. realignment&#13;
o f an irrigationcanal, or land for a school), such land could only be obtained through either&#13;
private voluntary donations, compensation paidby the community (i.e. transaction between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
willing buyer-willing seller), or from available government land. Private voluntary donations and&#13;
community purchases would be documented as requiredby the Framework, and for government&#13;
land, documentation would be needed that the landis free o f encroachments, squatters or other&#13;
encumbrances, and has been transferred to the project by the authorities.&#13;
&#13;
8.       The design for the project defines a strategy, which will ensure that ethnic minoritv&#13;
groups are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed incompliance with the&#13;
requirements o f OD 4.20. The key elements o fthis strategy are (i)  the project i s national inscale&#13;
and coverage, and consequently reaches all the country's different ethnic groups, (ii)   the&#13;
facilitated participatory planningprocess at the community level includes an approach for&#13;
election o f Community Development Councils, which will provide for representation o f all sub-&#13;
groups inthe community, (iii) internal monitoring and external independent evaluation will&#13;
                                both&#13;
assess the inclusiveness o f Community DevelopmentCouncils and thus provide information that&#13;
would constitute the basis for corrective actions, ifnecessary, and (iv) independent monitoring by&#13;
civil society (NGOsand the press) will provide another mechanism to identify cases where ethnic&#13;
minority would have been bypassed or marginalized.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Chance finds o f cultural proper&amp; (archaeological artifacts) duringimplementationo f sub-&#13;
projects involvingcivil works will be reported to the provincial or district governors, who then&#13;
will informthe ArchaeologicalCommittee.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Compliance with the safeguard provisions and the negative list will be ensured through&#13;
an environmental, social and mine risk screeningprocedure (check lists) required for sub-project&#13;
proposals, andby internal input,process, and output monitoring, independent external monitoring&#13;
byconsultants, and by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
Purpose of the Environmental and Social Management Framework&#13;
&#13;
11.      Currently social and environmental management inAfghanistan is suffering from critical&#13;
capacity constraints. Since there i s potential for adverse environmental impacts, albeit limited,&#13;
from the proposed activities under the NSP, their mitigation and management i s key to the&#13;
wholesome development o f rural communities throughout Afghanistan. Hence, keeping inview&#13;
the existingmanagement capacity, as well as the flexibility required due to the demand-driven&#13;
nature o f the project, a framework approach i s adopted. Itprovides for early identification o f&#13;
potential adverse impacts, without the requirement o frigorous analysis through quantification,&#13;
and also provides broad guidance for their effective mitigation. Consistent with existingnational&#13;
legislation, the objective of the Framework i s to help ensure that activities under the project will:&#13;
&#13;
    0    Protect human health;&#13;
&#13;
    0    Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
    0    Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their&#13;
         cumulative effects;&#13;
&#13;
    0    Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
&#13;
    0    Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguardpolicies.&#13;
&#13;
General Principles&#13;
&#13;
12.      Recognizingthe emergency nature o f the proposed reconstruction operation, and the&#13;
related need for providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence inmanaging&#13;
potential environmental and social risks, this Framework i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         0  The project will support multiple sub-projects, the detailed designs o f which i s&#13;
            known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application o fthe World Bank's&#13;
            safeguard policies, the Frameworkprovides guidance on the approach to be taken&#13;
            duringimplementationfor the selection and design of sub-projects, and the planning&#13;
            o f mitigation measures;&#13;
         0  Allproposedsub-projects will be screened (usingMatrix 1) to ensure that the&#13;
            environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the application&#13;
            o f standardized guidelines (usingMatrix 2);&#13;
         0  The design o fthe NSP aims at ensuring regionalbalance interms o f coverage o f&#13;
            ethnic and religious groups, as well as gender equity with regardto decisionmalung&#13;
            on sub-project selection and projectbenefits. Employment opportunities withinthe&#13;
            projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis o fprofessional&#13;
            competence, irrespective ethnic or religious group affiliation. Inall projects which&#13;
            require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated&#13;
            consultations will be conducted to elicit the views o f the female population, along&#13;
            with that o fthe male population; and,&#13;
            Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs&#13;
            o f these operations. Prior to approval by the World BankBoard, this Environmental&#13;
            and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed inAfghanistan inDari and&#13;
            Pashto, and inthe World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard Screening&#13;
&#13;
 13.    Additionally, the selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects&#13;
will be consistent with the following guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
        0   A negative list o fcharacteristicsthat would make aproposed subproject ineligible for&#13;
            support (Attachment 1);&#13;
            Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation&#13;
            (Attachment 2);&#13;
&#13;
        0   Procedures for the protection o f cultural property, including the chance discovery o f&#13;
            archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites (Attachment 3);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation measures&#13;
&#13;
14.     Sound design will ifnot eliminate, then at least diminishto the extent possible, most o f&#13;
the potential adverse impacts o fproject activities. Good Engineeringdesign will, inmost cases,&#13;
have a positive impact on the environmental conditions inthe project area. Constructionand&#13;
operation stage impacts will be addressed through a simplified Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
Social and environmental guidelines and codes o fpractice will be includedinthe Project's&#13;
technical manual, that i s currently under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
15.     The overall responsibility o fproject implementationrests with the Ministry o f&#13;
Rehabilitationand Rural Development (MRRD). A designated Safeguards Nodal Officer will be&#13;
identifiedwith responsibility for overseeing the implementationo f the Environmental and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework and Management Plan withinthe Project Management Team (PMT) at the&#13;
MRRD.TheMinistry's FocalPointwillbe supportedbythe OversightConsultant firmmanaging&#13;

the implementation o f the project, which will be responsible for (i)appraising sub-project&#13;
proposals, and (ii) monitoring that sub-project implementation is inaccordance with the&#13;
provisions o f the social and environmental management framework&#13;
&#13;
CapacityBuilding&#13;
&#13;
16.     As part o fthe social andenvironmental capacity buildingthat willbeprovided for&#13;
implementationo f IDA-financed operations inAfghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Points and&#13;
relevant staff o fthe MRRDand implementing agencies/Consultants will receive training inthe&#13;
applicationo f the SafeguardFramework. Iti s proposedto prepare specific materials, hold a&#13;
workshop, and arrange site visits to other countries inthe region on similar projects inprogress to&#13;
provide hands-on training to the Ministry and implementing agency staff. Specialist training&#13;
modules may be considered after an acceptable level o f base knowledge has been established.&#13;
This capacitybuildingactivity will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance&#13;
program for Environmental and Social management.&#13;
&#13;
17.     Duringsupervision o fthe project, IDAwill assessthe implementationo fthe Framework,&#13;
and ifrequired will recommendadditional strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationandDisclosure&#13;
&#13;
18.     This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed by ITSA inboth&#13;
Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made available at the World Bank's&#13;
Infoshop. It i s worth noting that ITSA intends to make all project documentation publicly&#13;
available through the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS).&#13;
&#13;
19.     Extensive consultations have been held with the Facilitating Partner NGOsregarding the&#13;
NSP approach and implementation arrangements. Sub-projects will involve consultations within&#13;
the communities regarding (i) holding o f secret ballot elections for representative community&#13;
                                the&#13;
development Councils, (ii)  prioritization o f community needs, (iii)identificationo f projects&#13;
corresponding to these needs, (iv) development and costing o f sub-project plans, and (v)&#13;
arrangements to ensure disclosure o f budget and expenditures. The following information on the&#13;
project would be posted on TISA's web-site: summaries o f quarterlyNSP implementation&#13;
progress reports, summaries of annual project financial statements and audit reports, and&#13;
summaries o f findings from monitoring and supervision teams (after a reasonable period for&#13;

undertaken and has establishedthat irrigation is feasible, investments inmotorized irrigation wells is not&#13;
permitted.&#13;

         Guidelinesfor LandandAsset Acquisition, Entitlements andComuensation&#13;
&#13;
I.Objectives&#13;
&#13;
Landacquisition will be kept to a minimumand no person will be involuntarily displaced under&#13;
sub-projects financed by the proposed emergency reconstruction operation. Sub-project&#13;
proposals that would require demolishinghouses or acquiringproductive land should be carefully&#13;
reviewedto minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals that&#13;
require more than minor expansion alongrights o fway should be reviewed carefully. No land or&#13;
asset acquisitionmay take place outside o f these guidelines. A format for LandAcquisition&#13;
Assessment i s attached as Attachment 2(i).&#13;
&#13;
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that&#13;
all such persons negatively affected, regardless o f their land tenure status, will be assisted to&#13;
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or productioncapacity to&#13;
pre-project levels.&#13;
&#13;
Categorization&#13;
&#13;
Based on the number o f persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People,&#13;
PAPs) and the magnitude o f impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects:&#13;
&#13;
    a.       S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement o f more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
             where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions&#13;
             willbe ineligible for support under the proposedemergency reconstruction&#13;
             operations.&#13;
    b.       S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement o f less than 200 persons. In&#13;
             such cases, the following documentation i s required: (1) a land acquisition&#13;
             assessment, (2) the Minutes or record of consultations which assess the compensation&#13;
             claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record o f the receipt o f the compensation,&#13;
             or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
    C.       S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant&#13;
             adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and&#13;
             improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
&#13;
11.Eligibility&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are identifiedas persons whose livelihood i s directly or indirectly affectedby the project.&#13;
PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
&#13;
    (1)      those who have formal legalrights to land, water resources or structureshuildings,&#13;
             includingrecognizedcustomary and traditional rights;&#13;
    (2)      those who do not have such formal legal rightsbut have a claimto usufruct right&#13;
             rooted incustomary law;&#13;
    (3)      those whose claimto land and water resources or building/structures do not fall&#13;
             within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
Acquisition ofProductiveAssets and Compensation&#13;
&#13;
PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as describedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        a.       Voluntaly contributions. Inaccordance with traditionalpractices, individuals&#13;
               may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or&#13;
              permanently from their landwithout compensation.&#13;
        b.       Contributions against compensation. A contributorlasset loser considered&#13;
               "affected" will be eligible for compensation from the local community or&#13;
               alternatively from the Government. A PAP shall lodge hisher claim for&#13;
               compensation to the local community representativeshhura head and it shall be&#13;
               verified by the implementingagency. The claim shall be lodgedwithin 2 weeks o f&#13;
               completion o fthe consultations with the concerned community, and before project&#13;
               implementation begins.&#13;
&#13;
Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented. The&#13;
documentation should specify that the land is free o f any squatters, encroachers or other claims.&#13;
A format is attachedinAttachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
&#13;
111.CompensationPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any o f the following means o f compensation&#13;
are provided ina timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
&#13;
(1)     Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other productive assets&#13;
        with the remaining assets beingeconomically viable are entitledto compensation at&#13;
        replacement cost for that portion o f land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost&#13;
        assets will be according to following principles:&#13;
        a.       replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
                 productive assets;&#13;
        b.       materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
        C.       replacement o f damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
        d.       other acceptable in-kindcompensation;&#13;
        e.       incaseofcashcompensation, the delivery o fcompensation shouldbemade in&#13;
                 public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.&#13;
&#13;
(2)     Project affected persons losing access to a portion o f their land or other economic assets&#13;
        rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options o f compensation&#13;
        for the entire asset by provision o f alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,&#13;
        according to the principles in(1) a-d above.&#13;
&#13;
ConsultationProcess&#13;
&#13;
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants o f land and owners o f assets locatedin&#13;

documentation and be available for inspection during supervision.&#13;
&#13;
Subproject Approval&#13;
&#13;
Inthe event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing&#13;
agency shall:&#13;
&#13;
        a. not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed&#13;
            between the affected person and the local community;&#13;
        b. not allow works to start untilthe compensationhas beendeliveredina satisfactory&#13;
            manner to the affected persons;&#13;
        c.  ifmorethan200personsare affected andrequirecompensation, the subproject shall&#13;
            be deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
&#13;
All complaints should first benegotiated to reachan agreement at the local community/village&#13;
level. Ifthis falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the&#13;

&#13;
                                   Protectionof CulturalPropertv&#13;
&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f view,&#13;
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property i s defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risko f damaging&#13;
cultural property, as the sub-projects will largely consist o f small investments incommunity&#13;
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction o f existing structures, and minor&#13;
urbanpublic works. Further, the negative list o f attributes, which would make a subproject&#13;
ineligible for support (Attachment I),    includes any activity that would significantly damage non-&#13;
replicable cultural property. Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection&#13;
from theft, and treatment o f chance finds should be followed and included in standard bid&#13;
documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance find procedures are definedinthe law on Maintenance o f Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities&#13;
o f cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered inthe course o fproject&#13;
implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural&#13;
artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
&#13;
     1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessmento fhistorical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministryo f Information&#13;
         and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
         made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation o f&#13;
         work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
         untila solutionis found for the preservationo fthese artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
     3. Ifa moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found inthe countryside o f a&#13;
         province, the provincial governor (wali)or district-in-charge (woluswal)should be&#13;
         informed within two weeks, and they should informthe Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
         case the immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found ina city, the provincial branch&#13;
         o f the Department o f Maintenance o f Historical Values of the Ministry o f Information&#13;
         and Culture shouldbe informed within two weeks (art. 18). Ifthe find i s made within the&#13;
         center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art.&#13;
         25).&#13;
&#13;
     4. Failure to report a chance find withinthe stipulated time limit will bepunishedwitha&#13;
         fine or imprisonment for a period o f one week or upto one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
     5. Ifsomeone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shallpay&#13;
         compensation inaccordance with the value o f the artifact plusbe imprisoned for a period&#13;
         o f one month to ten years depending on the gravity of the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Incase o fa chance find o fmoveable or immovable historicalor cultural artifact, the&#13;
implementing agency i s responsible for securing the artifact fi-om theft, pilferage and damage&#13;
untilthe responsibilityhasbeentaken overbythe relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures mustbe referred to as standard provisions inconstruction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. Duringproject supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment o f any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded inWorld Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o f the project's&#13;
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity buildingactivities, as appropriate.&#13;

         communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000 each);&#13;
         Small and medium-size works to be identifiedby local authorities (or Community&#13;
         Development Councils) and implemented by local contractors (for projects up to $5m&#13;
         each)(projects implementedby contractors for Community Development Councils would&#13;
         generally be below $60,000, but could conceivably be o f higher value, ifcommunities&#13;

         Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m) [not applicable];&#13;
&#13;
2.       General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance&#13;
tasks shall be implementedincoordinationwith the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan&#13;
(MACA). These procedures may needto be amended inthe future depending on evolving&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Communitv-ManagedWorks&#13;
&#13;
3.       Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitation / construction works to&#13;
be identifiedand implementedby the communities themselves (for small projects o f up to&#13;
$100,000 each).&#13;
&#13;
4.       Overallapproach: The communities should be responsible for malung sure that the&#13;
projects they propose are not inmine-contaminated areas, or have been clearedbyMACA (or a&#13;
mine action organization accreditedby MACA).&#13;
&#13;
5.       Rationale: Communities are best placedto know about minedareas intheir vicinity, and&#13;
have a strong incentive to report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
6.       Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected&#13;
presence o fmines inthe area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be&#13;
implemented. This questionnaire should be formally endorsedby the Mine Action Programfor&#13;
Afghanistan(MAF'A).     Itwill be a mandatory attachmentto the project submissionbythe&#13;
communities and shouldbe signed by community representatives and the external project&#13;
facilitator. Extemal project facilitators will receive training from MAPA.Financingagreements&#13;
with the communities should make clear that communities are solely liable incase o f a mine-&#13;
related accident.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  82&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.      Ifthe communitycertifies thatthere isnoknown minecontamination inthe area, the&#13;
ministryresponsible for the selection o fprojects should check with MACA whether any different&#13;
observation i s reported on MACA's data base.&#13;
&#13;
            o IfMACA's information is the same, the project can go ahead for selection. The&#13;
                 community takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and external&#13;
                 organizations cannot be made liable incase o f an accident.&#13;
&#13;
            o IfMACA's informationis different, the project shouldnot go ahead for selection&#13;
                 as long as MACA's and community's statements have not been reconciled.&#13;
&#13;
8.     Ifthe community suspectsmine contamination inthe area,&#13;
&#13;
            o Ifthe communityhas includedan assessment/ clearance task inthe project&#13;
                 agreed to be implementedby M A C A (or by a mine action organization&#13;
                 accredited by MACA), the project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
            o Ifthe communityhas not includedan assessment/ clearance task inthe project,&#13;
                 the project should not go ahead for selection as long as this has notbeen&#13;
                 corrected.&#13;
&#13;
            o Mineclearance tasks mustbe implementedbyM A C A or by a mine action&#13;
                 organization accredited byMACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent&#13;
                 fundingby World-Bank fundedprojects shall bereducedor cancelled) ifthey&#13;
                 elect to clear mines on their own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                 Procedurefor SmallandMedium-size Works ContractedOut&#13;
&#13;
9.     Applicability:This procedure applies to small- andmedium-size works to be identified&#13;
by localauthorities andimplementedbylocal contractors (for projects upto $5meach).&#13;
&#13;
10.     Overallapproach:M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited byMACA) should&#13;
provide detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and&#13;
updated general survey or on a new general survey) beforeprojects are considered for selection.&#13;
Onlyproject sites assessedto have a nil-to-low riskwould be eligible for selection, unless they&#13;
have been demined by MACA or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA.&#13;
&#13;
11.    Rationale:Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the&#13;
mine-related risks in a systematic way, while they may have incentives to underestimate them.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey should be carriedout by&#13;
       MACA (or a mine action organization accreditedbyMACA) to assessmine-related risks&#13;
       inthe areao ftheproject (thisshould include checkmginformationavailable inthe&#13;
       MACA database).&#13;
&#13;
    2. If A C A provides information suggesting a nil-to-low riskinthe project area, the project&#13;
          M&#13;
       can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. The contract between the responsible ministryand the contractor will include a clause&#13;
   stating that incase o f an accident, legal liability would be fully and solely borne by the&#13;
   contractor.&#13;
&#13;
4. IfMACA assesses a potentially highriskinthe area (whether due to the presence o f&#13;
  mines or uncertainty),&#13;
&#13;
       o Ifthe project includes an assessment/ clearance task agreed to be implemented&#13;
            byMACA (or by a mine actionorganization accreditedbyMACA), it can go&#13;
            ahead for selection based on agreed funding modalities (clearance may be funded&#13;
            either under a contract with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor&#13;
            agreements with the mine action organization);&#13;
&#13;
       o Ifthe project does not includedan assessmentI clearance task, it shouldnot go&#13;
            ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Emergency National Solidarity
            Project for Afghanistan will lay the foundations for
            strengthening community level governance, and support
            community-managed sub-projects comprising reconstruction and
            development that improve the access o f rural communities to
            social and productive infrastructure and services. The Grant
            will finance block grants to village communities,
            consultants for community facilitation and sub- project
            preparation, consultants for program management and
            monitoring, capacity building and implementation support for
            the implementing ministry, and consultants for external
            evaluation.  The project benefits will be (i) the
            empowerment o f local communities through the establishment
            o f village level consultative decision making and
            representative local leadership as a basis for interaction
            within and between communities on the one hand, and with the
            administration and aid agencies on the other; and (ii) local
            level reconstruction, development, and capacity building
            leading to a decrease in poverty levels. Through these
            benefits, the project will also contribute to stability in
            Afghanistan. Likely risks are weak institutional capacity; a
            fragile security situation; elite capture o f benefits, and
            misuse o f funds. Appropriate mitigation measures have been
            proposed to address these risks.  The Credit i s expected t
            o be fully disbursed in a 33 month period.
