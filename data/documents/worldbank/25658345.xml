others 2015).&#13;
&#13;
How they did it&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Morocco ensured its nationally targeted sectors had an&#13;
     adequate supply of skilled workers. Sector priorities set by the&#13;
     Office of Professional Training and Employment Promotion&#13;
     (OFPPT) closely adhered to those in Moroccoâ&#128;&#153;s Emergence&#13;
     plan, which targets key sectors. OFPPT works closely with the&#13;
     National Agency for the Promotion of Employment and Skills&#13;
     (ANAPEC), and together the two agencies offer an online tool&#13;
     for job seekers, an innovative program to commercialize entre-&#13;
     preneurial ideas, and customized training programs.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Private industry provides feedback on the specific skills it&#13;
     needs through special institutional mechanismsâ&#128;&#148;Organs de&#13;
     Gouvernance. These exist at both the national and local level,&#13;
     and the feedback is channeled to OFPPT, ANAPEC, and univer-&#13;
     sities. ANAPEC conducts studies on sectoral workforce needs&#13;
     in which it collaborates with training institutes, universities,&#13;
     as well as human resources managers and sectoral professional&#13;
     associations.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   IFMIA, the Institute for Training in the Automotive Industry&#13;
     Trades, is operated by Renault next to its plant and serves to&#13;
     fill the talent pipeline in automotive production. IFMIA was&#13;
     tasked with training for jobs within Renault as well as for&#13;
     components suppliers. It was funded by numerous national&#13;
     agencies but operated by Renault, and it taught skills such as&#13;
     stamping, welding, riveting, assembly, hydraulics, pneumatics,&#13;
     electrics, materials handling, servo systems, mechanics, robot-&#13;
     ics, forklift operations, sanding, painting, and logistics.&#13;
&#13;
What they achieved&#13;
Maintaining and enhancing the 5,500 direct jobs and 30,000 indi-&#13;
rect jobs supported by Renault at its site in Tangier has improved&#13;
the cityâ&#128;&#153;s position in the automotive sector, helped solidify Renaultâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
commitment to its Tangier location, and opened the way to auto&#13;
industry growth. A Nissan plant is expected to be built in the area&#13;
(a sister plant to the Renault one) and Delphi Automotive and Lear&#13;
Automotive already employ 4,900 and 2,500, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
What cities can learn&#13;
Tangierâ&#128;&#153;s workforce development programs closely aligned with&#13;
its targeted sectors, which is critically important to establishing&#13;
local capacity and enhancing the attractiveness of those sectors to&#13;
increased foreign and domestic investment. The city made use of&#13;
investment attraction strategies to draw several producers after&#13;
Renault and provide the skilled workers those producers and local&#13;
suppliers need to meet growing production needs.&#13;
