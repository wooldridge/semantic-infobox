PRIVATE CAPITAL FLOWS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
AND THEIR DETERMINATION:. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE,&#13;
RECENT EXPERIENCE, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
From an analysis of borrowing experience by oil-importing developing coun-&#13;
tries (OIDC's), it is concluded that in recent literature on private capi-&#13;
tal flows too much emphasis has been placed on the constraints on banking&#13;
intermediaries.   The key determinant of flows through banking markets is&#13;
the macroeconomic environment (the orientation of global current account&#13;
balances, the state of domestic loan demands in the industrialized coun-&#13;
tries, etc.) that influences the supply of funds to the banks.      The banks&#13;
themselves are strongly motivated to intermediate internationally by a&#13;
desire to diversify their portfolios and by the profitability of inter-&#13;
national business broadly defined.     Constraints do impinge on particular&#13;
banks and particular borrowers at certain junctures, but for the market as&#13;
a whole these constraints will not be severe as long as there are groups of&#13;
banks--the Middle East banks are a current example--with an abundence of&#13;
capital and an undiversified portfolio that are willing to establish a mar-&#13;
ket presence. Prospects for greater access of the OIDC's to the fixed-rate&#13;
international bond markets will remain bleak so long as high and variable&#13;
interest rates persist and the public sectors in the industrialized coun-&#13;
tries continue to preempt large volumes of fixed-rate funds.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
This paper examines the recent evolution of private capital flows&#13;
to developing countries and seeks to identify those factors which are&#13;
likely to be most potent in influencing their size and make-up in the early&#13;
1980s.     The  focus   of  attention   will   be  almost   entirely  on  the&#13;
quantitatively   most  important   flows,  specifically   those  through   the&#13;
international capital markets to the middle- and low-income oil-importing&#13;
developing countries (OIDC's). 1/&#13;
The paper will seek to shed light in particular on borrowing&#13;
experience by the OIDC's, for it has been argued by some economists,&#13;
bankers, and market commentators that the flow of funds through private&#13;
markets to these countries might be slowing down--and this at a time when&#13;
the OIDC's are having to cope with increasing current account deficits that&#13;
require financing. In this scenario of constrained private capital flows,&#13;
the strain can be taken in the short term by a run-down in reserve levels.&#13;
If, however, no alternative forms of financing are forthcoming, this would&#13;
imply a need for domestic policy adjustment and a slowing in the tempo of&#13;
economic development.&#13;
There is one feature of the methodology of this paper that merits&#13;
attention. The most significant development in the world economy over the&#13;
last decade has been the increasing interdependence of its component&#13;
economies.    Increasing  trade  linkages  have  brought  with   them greater&#13;
interdependence of real activity both between and within the industrialized&#13;
and developing economies. Of particular relevance to this paper, however,&#13;
is the increasing financial interdependence in the world economy brought&#13;
1/ Developing countries comprise the middle- and low-income OIDC's to-&#13;
gether with   the oil-exporting   developing  countries   (OEDC's).    The&#13;
Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries which run large current account&#13;
surpluses  are   defined  as   capital-surplus  oil-exporting   countries&#13;
(CSOEC' s).&#13;
&#13;

about by the growth of the international banking and bond markets.         The&#13;
removal of barriers to capital flows into and out of the industrial&#13;
economies has also meant increasing interdependence of financial conditions&#13;
within the industrialized economies and in the international markets.      The&#13;
implication of this observation for the present paper is that the ability&#13;
of the developing countries to raise funds in the international markets&#13;
will largely depend on conditions in the industrialized countries.         The&#13;
determination of economic and financial conditions in this latter group of&#13;
countries must accordingly be the subject of analysis.&#13;
1I. Historical Perspective&#13;
The 1960s and Early 1970s&#13;
The pattern of developing country financing that existed prior to&#13;
1974 was markedly different from that which has since ensued.         Foreign&#13;
capital financed between 10% and 20% of total investment in ¶these&#13;
countries.   The bulk of foreign capital took the form of official flows;&#13;
that is, grants and loans from official bodies on concessional or market&#13;
terms.   In 1969, the first year for which comprehensive debt data are&#13;
available, 55% of the outstanding debt of developing countries was from&#13;
official sources.   Of the remainder, the bulk is believed to have been in&#13;
the form of officially guaranteed suppliers' credits.      The rest took the&#13;
form of direct foreign investments.&#13;
Two changes began to take place towards the end of the 1960s.&#13;
First, private Western banks began to see the benefits of overseas lending&#13;
and started to increase their external exposure to, among others, the&#13;
developing countries.    The banks were strongly motivated to diversify the&#13;
risks in their portfolios toward high-yielding overseas loans. Second,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
workers' remittances 1/ came to assume an increasing importance for&#13;
developing countries as a source of finance, particularly those countries&#13;
in Southern Europe and North Africa.     This development reflected the&#13;
growing mobility of workers from within these two regions.&#13;
1973-78: Adjusting to the First Oil Price Shock&#13;
A change in pattern of developing country financing had begun to&#13;
take place at the end of the 1960s, but in many respects 1973 marked a&#13;
distinct turning point.  In that year the major oil-producing countries,&#13;
after a long period during which they had seen the real price of their main&#13;
export fall, took steps to raise the relative price of their oil.    The&#13;
price adjustment took the form of an abrupt and unexpected price increase&#13;
a quadrupling over the 1973-74 period.&#13;
The price rise brought about a distinct increase in the size of the&#13;
current account surpluses run by the oil-producing countries that had as&#13;
its counterpart rises in the deficits (or falls in surpluses) of the&#13;
industrialized countries and the oil-importing countries. (See Table 1.)&#13;

As well as adjusting to the rise in energy prices, the OIDC's had&#13;
to contend with the impact of an associated recession in the industrialzed&#13;
countries.    The consequent   fall-off  in OIDC exports exacerbated     their&#13;
payment  situations.    After the sharp deterioration in current account&#13;
positions in 1974, which continued into 1975, there was an improvement that&#13;
resulted from a leveling out of the oil price in nominal terms.       In real&#13;
terms oil prices fell as the decade progressed.&#13;
The improvement also reflected a degree of domestic policy&#13;
adjustment  in the OIDC's.     Experience with adjustment was not uniform&#13;
across developing countries. Some middle-income OIDC's (in particular the&#13;
newly industrialized countries) that had ready access to the fast-growing&#13;
international capital markets were able to quicken their export growth or&#13;
import substitution strategies.    1/  The growth rates of the middle-income&#13;
countries held up remarkably well--an annual GDP growth rate of 5.6% in the&#13;
1970s compared with one of 6.2% in the 1960s--given the size of their&#13;
current account deterioration in 1974-75. This may be explained in part by&#13;
the fact that the oil price rise was construed by many of these countries&#13;
as a one-time occurrence.     Accordingly, there was a strong incentive to&#13;
finance the increased current account burden rather than to undertake swift&#13;
economic policy adjustment that would have been very wasteful in economic&#13;
resources.&#13;
Those low-income OIDC's not benefiting from good harvests and with&#13;
only limited access to commercial financing were, in contrast, forced to&#13;
cut their oil imports and attain little economic growth (3% in the 1970s&#13;
compared with 4.2% in the 1960s) and probably zero growth in per capita&#13;
terms.&#13;

Bank, World Development Report 1981 (New York: Oxford University Press,&#13;
August 1981), chapter 6, and other papers in this series.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1979 and After: Adjustment to the Second Oil Price Shock&#13;
As forementioned, the fall in the real price of oil through the&#13;
mid-1970s wiped out much of the price adjustment that had taken place in&#13;
1973-74. In many respects the world had returned to its pre-1973 position,&#13;
with CSOEC's accumulating only small current account surpluses and the&#13;
surpluses of the industrialized countries mirrored by deficits in the&#13;
developing countries (see Table 1). In 1979 the CSOEC's took further steps&#13;
to readjust the oil price. As a result, the price effectively doubled over&#13;
the 1979-80 period.&#13;
The 1979-80 oil shock accompanied a deeper world recession with&#13;
worse unemployment levels, more unused capacity, and higher inflation and&#13;
interest rates in the industrialized countries than occured after the shock&#13;
of  1973-74.    The deflationary   policies  adopted by many industrialized&#13;
countries following the recent shock - particularly the strong predilection&#13;
in favor of monetary policy - have compounded the problems facing the&#13;
OIDC's. The resulting fall in activity in the industrialized countries -&#13;
quantitatively the most important factor - adversly affected the exports of&#13;
the OIDC's. With respect to monetary policy, a tight control of the money&#13;
supply is seen in certain countries as a necessary (and in some cases&#13;
sufficient) condition for controlling     inflation.    This type of policy&#13;
requires for its imposition a willingness to allow short-term interest&#13;
rates to fluctuate almost without constraint.     As much developing country&#13;
debt has been contracted on a floating-rate basis in dollars, 1/     the sharp&#13;
upward movements in U.S. short-term rates (which are closely related to&#13;
Eurodollar rates) will unfavorably affect the debt-servicing burden of the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
1/   The thirty-three largest developing country borrowers held a total&#13;
variable interest-rate debt of about US$180 billion, most of it denomi-&#13;
nated in dollars. For each percentage point increase in the Eurodollar&#13;
rate (normally the six-month rate) these thirty-three countries face&#13;
extra interest charges of $1.8 billion a year. For further coverage of&#13;
this point, see N.C. Hope, Developments in and Prospects for the Exter-&#13;
nal Debt of Developing Countries: 1970-80 and Beyond, Staff Working&#13;
Paper No. 488 (Washington, D.C., August 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In many respects, however, the most recent oil shock has been&#13;
superimposed on a world economy better prepared to absorb it, not least&#13;
because governmeats had gained, over the previous six years, some&#13;
experience in coping with the effects of such oil price increases.         The&#13;
learning process has also helped the international banks.       In the years&#13;
since 1974, international banking activity has grown approximately two and&#13;
one-half times in real terms (fourfold in nominal terms); hence, the banks&#13;
have had six year's experience to call upon in handling the renewed need&#13;
for recycling.&#13;
There are, however, some worrisome features associated with the&#13;
second oil shock.    The balance-of-payments adjustment problem may persist&#13;
longer because the import-absorptive capacity of the CSOEC's is lower now&#13;
than it was after the 1973-74 shock.     The outstanding debts of the OIDC's&#13;
meanwhile are considerably higher, in nominal terms at least, than they&#13;
were prior to the first oil shock (see Table 2).     The OIDC debt problem is&#13;
compounded by the high servicing costs that have been brought about by a&#13;
combination of the large debt volume and increased short-term interest&#13;
rates (noted above).&#13;

The Evolving Pattern of Financing&#13;
The global economic developments that took place during the 1970s&#13;
have had direct implications for the nature and volume of financing that&#13;
the developing countries have received. The financing of the middle-income&#13;
OIDC's has exhibited the most dramatic changes (see Table 3).&#13;

Perhaps the most remarkable development, however, was the vast&#13;
growth in lending by international banks.     As much of the surplus of the&#13;
CSOEC's   had  been   placed   either  directly   or   indirectly   with   the&#13;
international banks, these institutions acted as intermediaries for the&#13;
recycling of funds, although many doubts were expressed at the time as to&#13;
whether they could cope with such large volume of funds.&#13;
For the low-income OIDC's, the pattern of financing has changed&#13;
relatively little over the decade.      They have had to rely primarily on&#13;
ODA.   This form of finance reached its peak in 1975 as the industrialized&#13;
countries responded to the heavy financing requirements of the low-income&#13;
countries.    Since then ODA has grown very slowly.        The only form of&#13;
financing that has exhibited substantial growth over the 1970s is workers'&#13;
remittances.   Remittances grew to reach 33% of net financial flows to the&#13;
low-income OIDC's in 1978.&#13;
Borrowing in the International Capital Markets&#13;
It has been shown that borrowing through the international capital&#13;
markets has become the most important source of financing for the&#13;
developing countries, particularly for the middle-income OIDC's.        Before&#13;
attempting to analyze the reasons for the growth in borrowing, it is&#13;
necessary to examine in more depth the nature of the borrowing over the&#13;
last decade.   To place developing country borrowing in proper perspective,&#13;
three sets of data must be examined:      (1) gross borrowing commitments in&#13;
the syndicated medium-term Eurocurrency credit market and the terms&#13;
attached to such loans, (2) net international bank lending, and (3) the&#13;
issuance of foreign and international bonds.     For (1) and (3), the source&#13;
of data is the World Bank's Capital Markets System (CMS); for (2), the Bank&#13;
for International Settlements (BIS).&#13;

In terms of nominal volume of OIDC borrowing there was a pause in&#13;
1977 and in the first half of 1980.  It was the most recent pause that some&#13;
market observers took as an indication that an adverse change in bank&#13;
sentiment toward OIDC's might have begun.   In the event, rising spreads&#13;
appear to have encouraged further bank lending, and loan volume picked up&#13;
substantially.  In the first half of 1981 the share of OIDC borrowing in&#13;
total borrowing had reached a high 43%.&#13;
Developing countries' access to the syndicated lending market was&#13;
encouraged by a number of factors.  The large volumes of funds that could&#13;
be mobilized in one operation were attractive to developing countries, as&#13;
were such attributes as the speed with which credits could be arranged,&#13;
flexibility in their use, etc.  Whereas borrowing from the International&#13;
Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  for   instance,  entailed  a  degree  of  policy&#13;
conditionality, market borrowing did not. This became a potent argument in&#13;
favor of the latter at certain junctures.&#13;

&#13;

The terms on syndicated lending (spreads and maturity of loans)&#13;
which were easy in 1973 tightened significantly in 1974--spreads widened&#13;
and maturities shortened (see Table 5). These tighter conditions persisted&#13;
into 1976.  Thereafter conditions eased considerably and 1978 and 1979 saw&#13;
a "borrowers' market" in which almost all borrowers were able to negotiate&#13;
fine terms on their syndicated loans.    Since the beginning of 1980 OIDC's&#13;
have had to face generally stiffer terms, however, combined with high&#13;
average levels of LIBOR (the London inter-bank offered rate).&#13;

BIS banking data may be distinguished from the syndicated loan data&#13;
in that they cover the actual outstanding international lending activity&#13;
(including syndicated, non-syndicated, and short-term lending) of all banks&#13;
reporting to that institution. 1/ BIS data are thus a broader measure of&#13;
international banking flows.   Using this measure it can be seen from Table&#13;
6 that outstanding lending to the OIDC's has increased two and one-half&#13;
times since the end of 1976.     It is also notable that the share of OIDC&#13;
lending in total international bank lending has increased since the end of&#13;
1979.  Furthermore, in the post-1979 period such lending has continued to&#13;
grow at annual rates in excess of 20%.&#13;

The external bond markets have not been a major source of finance&#13;
to OIDC's.    Indeed, as Table 7 shows, only in the period 1977-79--good&#13;
years generally for bond financing--did the OIDC's secure significant&#13;
volumes  of   funds.    Floating-rate  notes   (effectively,  bonds  with   an&#13;
adjustable coupon) have come to assume increasing importance, as have&#13;
certain other innovating fund-raising techniques (convertible issues and&#13;
warrant   issues,  for   instance).    However,   it  has   been  mainly   the&#13;
sophisticated   borrowers   from  the  industrialized   economies  that   have&#13;
benefited from these innovations.&#13;

Taking new flows of funds through both the banking and bond markets&#13;
to the OIDC's--that is, net new international bank lending and net 1/&#13;
issuance of bonds--the nominal volume has increased from $11 billion in&#13;
1973 to about $52 billion in 1980.   A measure of the adequacy of these&#13;
flows relative to fund requirements is the ratio of total net lending to&#13;
total current account deficits and reserve changes. This ratio reached--at&#13;
35%--its low point in 1975, when the OIDC current account deficits were of&#13;
substantial size. By 1980 the ratio had reached about 65%. 2/&#13;
III. The Determination of Flows through the International Capital Markets&#13;
Some Preliminary Questions&#13;
The determination of the volume of capital flows through the&#13;
international markets is a matter of considerable academic debate--a debate&#13;
which is far from resolution at the time of writing. What is set out below&#13;
is simply a framework for analysis and a discussion of some of the relevant&#13;
issues.  Readers are advised to follow up references cited for a deeper&#13;
understanding of these issues.&#13;

2/ "International Capital Markets: Recent Developments and Short-Term&#13;
Prospects, 1981," IMF Occasional Paper, No.7 (Washington, D.C., August&#13;
1981), p.7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
The volume of funds flowing through the international capital&#13;
markets is the result of three factors:    the primary supply of funds to the&#13;
markets, the demand for market funds, and the willingness of private&#13;
institutions to act as intermediaries in the process. As far as the supply&#13;
of funds to the market is concerned, it is important to ask what real&#13;
economic conditions in the world economy and what financial conditions&#13;
within the major industrial countries create the conditions for a flow of&#13;
funds to the external markets.&#13;
Furthermore, since the developing countries are imporant borrowers&#13;
in the international markets, the question of which factors determine&#13;
private capital flows to them can be subsumed initially in the question of&#13;
which factors determine market conditions in general.&#13;
In what follows, the banking markets will be considered separately&#13;
(in the next three sections) from the bond markets, although there is clear&#13;
substitutability   between   the   suppliers   of  funds   to   each  market.&#13;
Substitutability also exists on the borrowers' side of the markets.&#13;
The Supply of Funds to the Banking Markets&#13;
In the 1970s one of the main determinants of the volume of net&#13;
capital flows has been the size and distribution of worldwide current&#13;
account surpluses and deficits. The larger the absolute size of ex-ante 1/&#13;
surpluses and deficits, the larger the volume of the flows that might be&#13;
expected to take place through the international banking markets. Accord-&#13;
1/ Ex post the resulting levels of surpluses and deficits will tend to be&#13;
smaller. Their size depends largely on the degree of economic activity&#13;
in the surplus countries and the chosen balance between adjustment and&#13;
financing in the deficit countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
ing to this view, the large surpluses accumulated by the CSOEC's in the&#13;
wake of the two oil shocks would tend to be placed in the international&#13;
banking markets, thereby increasing market liquidity and encouraging&#13;
lending to those countries - in particular the OIDC's - which carry the&#13;
counterpart  current   account  deficits.     One  of  the  reasons  why   the&#13;
"recycling" process took place so smoothly after the first oil shock was&#13;
that much of the surplus of the CSOEC's was placed directly with the&#13;
international banks.   These banks, in turn, were prepared to carry both the&#13;
resulting maturity transformation risk - the CSOEC's typically placed their&#13;
funds at short-term while lending demand was for longer-term money - and&#13;
the country risk attached to loans.&#13;
One of the intriguing questions raised in the context of the&#13;
present round of recycling is the implications for the nature (and cost) of&#13;
capital flows to the OIDC's of greater placements by the surplus countries&#13;
outside the international banking system. Wherever such funds are placed,&#13;
however, it is clear that much, will eventually find its way back into the&#13;
international banking markets through a chain of interest-rate-induced&#13;
financial substitution and eventual switching (or arbitraging) by the&#13;
Eurobanks.&#13;
As far as the world current account configuration is concerned, the&#13;
U.S. current account position may be of particular significance.       A U.S.&#13;
deficit, rather than absorbing funds from international markets, actually&#13;
provides funds as the dollar is voluntarily held as a reserve currency.&#13;
The unique role of the U.S. dollar, it has been argued, 1/ adds an&#13;
assymetry   to  the  system  which   is  perhaps   important  in  influencing&#13;
conditions in international markets.    A more potent argument, however, is&#13;
that Euromarket conditions are influenced not by the U.S. deficit per se,&#13;
1/ K. Inoue, "Determinants of Market Conditions in the Eurocurrency&#13;
Market - Why a Borrowers Market?" BIS Working Paper No. 1 (April 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
but by central bank intervention to support the dollar.       The dollar pro-&#13;
ceeds of the intervention tend to find their way back into the Euromarket.&#13;
These theories offer an explanation of why banking flows were strong to the&#13;
OIDC's in those years - 1977, and 1978 - when the CSOEC surplus was fall-&#13;
ing.&#13;
A further factor influencing the volume of flows through the inter-&#13;
national capital markets is the level of activity in industrial economies,&#13;
although this is slightly ambiguous in its effect.     Higher economic activ-&#13;
ity within the industrial economies may encourage increased exports from&#13;
the developing economies and by so doing improve the creditworthiness of&#13;
these countries.   This might encourage flows from the international capital&#13;
markets.   Such flows might also take place - and this is perhaps a more&#13;
potent argument - when activity in the industrialized countries is low.&#13;
Low economic activity will have as its counterpart a low level of domestic&#13;
loan demand from the banks. If this coincides with periods when there is a&#13;
high degree of liquidity in domestic banking markets, then banks may seek&#13;
alternative portfolio outlets for their surplus funds by lending intern-&#13;
ationally.   The upturn in international bank lending after the first oil&#13;
shock can be attributed in part to this cause.&#13;
It might be expected, ceteris paribus, that easy monetary con-&#13;
ditions 1/ in the major industrialized economies will spill over into the&#13;
Euromarkets, causing easy conditions there which would be conducive to&#13;
larger banking flows to the developing countries. Paradoxically, however,&#13;
in those countries which have non-interest-bearing reserve requirements on&#13;
bank liabilities (notably the United States), tighter monetary conditions&#13;
1/ The question of liquidity creation in the Eurocurrency market is dealt&#13;
with very comprehensively by H. Mayer in "Credit and Liquidity Creation&#13;
in the International Banking Sector," BIS Working Paper No. 1 (November&#13;
1979).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(implying high nominal interest rates) can encourage banks to book deposits&#13;
through offshore subsidiaries and thereby foster external intermediation.&#13;
The net effect of domestic monetary conditions in the industrialized econo-&#13;
mies on the flow of funds to the Euromarkets will ultimately, however,&#13;
depend (as discussed above) upon the state of domestic loan demand.&#13;
U.S. monetary policy has a clear and direct impact on the cost of&#13;
borrowing in the Euromarkets, for the Eurocurrency reference rate - LIBOR -&#13;
closely follows movements in U.S. domestic money-market rates due to the&#13;
arbitrage activities of the major international banks.l/       The best indi-&#13;
cator of conditions in the longer-term segment of the Eurocurrency market -&#13;
the syndicated loan market - are contractual loan spreads and not LIBOR it-&#13;
self.  In fact, historically the average level of spreads and LIBOR appear&#13;
to have moved inversely. 2/&#13;
The Demand for Banking Funds&#13;
A wide range of countries - industrialized, centrally planned,&#13;
capital-surplus oil-exporting, as well as developing - tap the inter-&#13;
national banking markets for funds.      The industrialized countries - the&#13;
main fund raisers - tend to borrow in these markets to the extent that they&#13;
are unable to attract to their own relatively sophisticated financial mar-&#13;
kets requisite volumes of funds to finance their payments imbalances.&#13;

Interest Rates," Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin (March 1979).&#13;

Industrial, commercial and financial entities within these coun-&#13;
tries also tap the markets from time to time to supplement their domestic&#13;
funding sources.   Furthermore, in the event of a tightening of conditions&#13;
in the international banking markets, heavy demands on the part of the&#13;
industrialized countries will tend to crowd out other borrowers, partic-&#13;
ularly developing country borrowers.&#13;
In the developing countries, much of the borrowing through private&#13;
markets that took place in the pre-1973 period was directly for development&#13;
purposes.   The first oil shock in 1973-74, however,       brought with it. a&#13;
demand for funds of a different order.      In the first place, funding was&#13;
required to cover the increased costs of needed oil imports.      Second, the&#13;
developing countries had to cover a shortfall in export earnings brought&#13;
about by the depth of the global recession which ensued.           Third,  the&#13;
borrowing itself had to be serviced while the higher inflation rates that&#13;
accompanied the shock brought higher nominal rates that exacerbated the&#13;
servicing burden (as noted in Section II).&#13;
If an individual developing country identifies a potential financ-&#13;
ing requirement, there are several factors that will determine when an&#13;
approach to the market will be made, and for how much this will be. 1/&#13;
The adequacy of the existing level of foreign currency reserves&#13;
will be an important determinant. Furthermore, even if the existing level&#13;
of reserves were sufficient to cover any projected financing requirements,&#13;
it might be rational for a developing country to take advantage of easy&#13;
Eurocurrency market conditions to borrow and bolster its resources (perhaps&#13;
temporarily reinvesting them in the Eurocurrency market) if it anticipates&#13;
a deterioration in conditions.&#13;
_/ Assuming that the country has already chosen an appropriate balance be-&#13;
tween domestic policy adjustment and financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
An important constraint on borrowing, however, will be the existing&#13;
and prospective level of debt outstanding combined with the likely extra&#13;
debt-servicing costs that will be involNed.       In summary, each "market-&#13;
eligible 1/ developing country will have its own unique borrowing strategy&#13;
that will be formulated against the background of movements in the costs of&#13;
borrowing as well as the size of prospective borrowing requirements and&#13;
their outstanding level of debt.&#13;
The Role of International Banking Intermediaries&#13;
The international banks have not been passive intermediaries&#13;
between the suppliers and demanders of funds.       They have, for instance,&#13;
been active in switching funds from domestic to international use when&#13;
domestic demand or returns have been low.    What is more, there has been a&#13;
marked tendency during the 1970s for banks to seek to internationalize&#13;
their business.   Aided by the relaxation of capital controls, banks have&#13;
been diversifying their portfolios by increasing their international lend-&#13;
ing at short-term and longer-term,     denominating loans in their own and&#13;
other currencies, and lending through branches and subsidiaries in offshore&#13;
markets.   The adjustment of bank portfolios in this direction has been&#13;
helped by innovations such as the development of the Eurocurrency inter-&#13;
bank market and the technique of syndication.      The international markets&#13;
have broadened, deepened, and become more competitive - with the result&#13;
that  the innovations   themselves  have  encouraged  faster  growth.     This&#13;
longer-run process of internationalizaticn was probab)ly under way well&#13;
before the first oil shock.&#13;
The high returns on offer in the international banking markets have&#13;
encouraged banks of different nationalities to enter these markets from&#13;
1/ Market-eligible developing countries-are primarily those in the middle-&#13;
income group, although certain low-income countries (India is a recent&#13;
example) with low volumes of private debt outstanding have been able to&#13;

time to time.     Conversely,  as returns have fallen relative       to  those&#13;
available in domestic markets different nationality groups of banks have&#13;
dropped out of international     lending.    It is the   inward  and outward&#13;
mobility of banks in this market that makes it so distinctive.       American&#13;
banks dominated the market in the 1960s and in the early to mid-1970s. The&#13;
international lending momentum was continued by the European banks and in&#13;
particular by the Japanese banks, which added a strong competitive fillip&#13;
to the market in 1972-73 and 1978-79 (although the Japanese Ministry of&#13;
Finance limited their market access at certain junctures).         During the&#13;
1977-78 period when international bank lending as a whole was accelerating,&#13;
the market share of American banks began to fall sharply.      This reflected&#13;
both the preponderance of new market entrants and the low levels of spreads&#13;
that many American banks found unattractive. More recently, there has been&#13;
a partial withdrawal from the market by German banks, whereas Middle East&#13;
banks 1/ have been increasing their presence substantially.&#13;
To summarize, the factors determining the market entry and exit of&#13;
banks are relative returns in domestic and international markets 2/ and,&#13;
closely associated with this motive, an underlying desire to expand&#13;
internationally   to  gain   the  benefits   of   portfolio  diversification.&#13;
Government policy is also important whether it is imposed for banking&#13;
prudential purposes or for balance-of-payments reasons - that is, where the&#13;
banks' activities may undermine a country's external financial position.&#13;

The allocation of bank lending between competing borrowers depends&#13;
upon the risk associated with the borrower relative to the return available&#13;
on the loan.    Differing spreads between borrowers will tend to reflect&#13;
differences in the banks' perceived creditworthiness of them. 1/ Some&#13;
developing countries may be limited in the amount they can obtain from the&#13;
banks, which may operate rationing 2/ in the form of self-imposed credit&#13;
ceilings.&#13;
Conditions in the External Bond Markets&#13;
Conditions in the foreign and international bond markets are rather&#13;
more susceptible to world economic, and particularly financial, events than&#13;
are the Eurocredit markets.    When conditions are not right for the launch-&#13;
ing of bond issues, an increase in international bank lending activity is&#13;
sometimes observed.&#13;
One of the key economic factors determining conditions in these&#13;
markets is the level of short-term interest rates relative to the yield on&#13;
bonds. 3/ When short-term rates exceed bond yields, there is a tendency for&#13;
bond issuance to fall off and even to dry up entirely.          The reasoning&#13;
behind this is that as short-term interest rates rise non-bank bond inves-&#13;
tors have an incentive to place funds in banks rather than take up bonds.&#13;
Banks, meanwhile, also hold bonds, but as short-term rates rise it becomes&#13;
unprofitable to finance bond holdings through their now more expensive&#13;
deposit liabilities.&#13;

3/ This is only true for fixed-coupon bonds. As noted early in Section II&#13;
bonds with floating rates - floating-rate notes - are assuming increas-&#13;
ing importance in the market.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Market conditions are also determined to a large extent by the&#13;
financial authorities. At times when the country concerned is experiencing&#13;
a current account surplus and inflows of capital, the, authorities will&#13;
often liberalize foreign access to their bond markets to encourage an out-&#13;
flow. The converse is also true.&#13;
The access of developing countries to the external bond markets is&#13;
determined largely by their credit ratings. Bond investors typically tend&#13;
to wish to invest in good-quality paper and only invest in higher-risk&#13;
names if an appropriately high coupon is set on the issue.         At certain&#13;
times developing countries will be crowded out of the bond markets by the&#13;
better-risk industrialized borrowers.    It is also the case, however, that&#13;
when market conditions are coducive to bond issuance and industrialized&#13;
country borrowers take advantage of the availability of fixed-rate funds,&#13;
there is greater scope for the developing countries to secure banking&#13;
finance.&#13;
IV. Recent Experience and Future Prospects&#13;
The Macroeconomic Environment, Current and Prospective&#13;
The second major oil price rise fed through into the industrialized&#13;
and OIDC economies toward the end of 1979 and into 1980 and 1981. As shown&#13;
in Table 8, there was a notable swing from current account surpluses to&#13;
deficits for the industrialized economies and a widening deficit for the&#13;
OIDC's that reflected the sharp increase in the surplus of the CSOEC's.&#13;
The direct effect on the OIDC current account position of the oil price&#13;
rise was worsened by the indirect effect of slower economic activity in the&#13;
industrialized countries, which dampenend demand for OIDC exports.       It is&#13;
noteworthy that the U.S. current account improved in 1979 and swung into&#13;
surplus in 1980, remaining there in 1981.&#13;

Economic activity has fallen substantially in the industrialized&#13;
countries. Real GNP growth of the seven largest industrial countries fell&#13;
from 4.3% in 1979 to 2.2% in 1980 and a projected 1% for 1981.      Unemploy-&#13;
ment rates at the same time have risen sharply.&#13;
As noted earlier, the policy response in industrial contries to&#13;
the oil shock has been to mitigate the inflationary impact by keeping mone-&#13;
tary growth in tight control.      High inflation (and inflationary expec-&#13;
tations) coupled with tight monetary policies has meant very high short-&#13;
term interest rates that have influenced the costs of borrowing in the&#13;
international markets.     At the same time, domestic loan demand in the&#13;
industrialized economies has been fairly subdued as a result of the low&#13;
activity in these economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Looking into the future, World Development Report 1981 predicts&#13;
that by 1985 the current account surpluses of the CSOEC's will be in the&#13;
order of $100 billion (see Table 8).    Some considerable improvement in the&#13;
current account position of the industrialized countries is expected over&#13;
the same period, with the result that the OIDC's will be unable to improve&#13;
their own current account positions in nominal terms.&#13;
Growth is expected to remain sluggish in the industrialized econo-&#13;
mies - between 2.6% and 3.3% during the 1980-85 period.      The period up to&#13;
1985 is also likely to be characterized by continued high inflation,&#13;
although the inflation rate may fluctuate about a marginally lower mean&#13;
than that observed in the latter half of the 1970s. This implies a con-&#13;
tinuation of historically high interest rates in the world's main money&#13;
and capital markets.&#13;
An Analysis of Recent Bank Lending to the OIDC's&#13;
This subsection draws upon the recent economic developments set out&#13;
thus far to explain movements in the data for bank lending to the OIDC's&#13;
(Tables 4 through 6).     The analysis is carried out with reference to a&#13;
simple supply and demand model.    It is assumed that the market is amenable&#13;
to conventional partial equilibrium analysis. 1/&#13;
Lending through the syndicated Eurocurrency credit market is the&#13;
most important form of private finance for the OIDC's, although the data&#13;
themselves are not entirely comprehensive 2/ and should be treated with&#13;
caution. 3/&#13;
1/ See A.E. Fleming and S.K. Howson, "Conditions in the Syndicated Medium-&#13;
term Eurocredit Market," Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin (Sept.&#13;
1980).&#13;
2/  Data only cover publicized lending.   The increasing importance of un-&#13;
published lending when market conditions tighten probably leads to an&#13;
underestimation of loan volume at such times.&#13;
3/ The data contain some stand-by credits (which may never be drawn) and&#13;
refinanced credits (which arguably impart a degree of double counting&#13;
to the data).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
A key question in the analysis is the nature of the clearing&#13;
price.   To the borrower, both LIBOR and spread will be important in deter-&#13;
mining the level of demand.    For the lending bank, it is the spread which&#13;
is of prime importance because this is the return on the banks' inter-&#13;
mediary services. Accordingly, the spread is taken as the clearing price,&#13;
and large changes in LIBOR are assumed to shift the curves rather than to&#13;
bring about movements along them.      Readers are advised that the simple&#13;
model described below is purely a characterization of events and is not&#13;
derived from a rigorous analysis based upon econometric investigation.&#13;
Table 9 summarizes the movements in the volume of and spreads on&#13;
lending as well as the main determinant of OIDC borrowing demand, their&#13;
current account positions.&#13;

The situation that evolved in 1978 is depicted in Chart 2.     On the&#13;
demand side of the market there was probably little increase in the&#13;
underlying demand for funds (the demand curve shifted outward only&#13;
slightly) because the current account deficits increased imperceptively.&#13;
On the supply side, however, there was a substantial increase in the&#13;
liquidity of the international banks, which shifted the supply curve&#13;
outward.   As noted in Section III, one explanation that has been offered&#13;
was the liquidity-creating effects of a U.S. current account deficit.        A&#13;
more potent explanation, however, may be the low level of domestic loan&#13;
demand in the industrialized countries. The result was an increase in the&#13;
quantity of borrowing (q 77 q     ) and a fall in spreads (s -Es 7 ).       An&#13;
interpretation of the 1978 outcome is that the OIDC's were actively&#13;
encouraged to borrow much more than their current needs by the banks, which&#13;
were flush with funds.   There was, consequently, a substantial build up in&#13;
OIDC borrowed reserves in 1978.&#13;

The situation in 1979 (Chart 3) was similar to that in 1978, except&#13;
the underlying demand for funds increased more than it had the previous&#13;
year (a larger outshift in the demand curve), a reflection of the worsened&#13;
current account position and the anticipation that market conditions might&#13;
deteriorate  in the near    future.   Market   liquidity increased   further,&#13;
however, bringing about the so-called borrowers' market.&#13;

By way of background to 1980, two developments influenced the&#13;
syndicated loan market. First, the general environment for syndication was&#13;
soured by the Iranian crisis and the freeze placed on Iranian banking&#13;
assets.   This development undermined the trust that had grown up between&#13;
banks - a trust that is so important for the efficient functioning of both&#13;
the inter-bank market and the syndication process. Second, a further major&#13;
oil price rise took place in 1979 and continued into 1980.       This had the&#13;
effect of widening the deficits of the industrialized countries and OIDC's&#13;
alike.    It is, however,   necessary   to consider   the experience   of  the&#13;
industrialized and OIDC economies separately in 1980. The demand for funds&#13;
by the industrialized countries increased in the wake of their larger&#13;
current account deficits.   On the supply side the surpluses of the CSOEC's&#13;
boosted the volume of funds available to the banks.        1/    The Japanese&#13;
Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, forced the Japanese banks to withdraw from&#13;
the market, and this helped to ameliorate competitive pressure. For the&#13;
industrialized economies, the increase in demand appears to have been more&#13;
than compensated by the increased supply.       This resulted in a greater&#13;
volume of borrowing and a further fall in spreads for this category of&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
1/ Although the improvements in the U.S. current account position may,&#13;
arguably, have had a tightening effect (see Section 'III).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
For the OIDC's the situation was slightly different. On the demand&#13;
side several factors - in addition to the OIDC current account deficits -&#13;
were at work.   Several of these may have moderated demand.    The high level&#13;
of reserves - accumulated during the easy market phase of 1978-79, when&#13;
much anticipatory borrowing took place - may have encouraged these coun-&#13;
tries to hold back from the market.    In any case, unused borrowing commit-&#13;
ments were high, and this meant that there would have been less need for&#13;
recourse to the markets. The high level of LIBOR may have also discouraged&#13;
many borrowers from approaching the market.    There was also another impor-&#13;
tant factor working on the supply side.      The heightened fears of country&#13;
risk, fueled by the high OIDC current account deficits, encouraged the&#13;
banks to reappraise their country lending limits. Against this background&#13;
the industrialized countries looked a more attractive lending proposition.&#13;
As a result, it seems reasonable to assume that there was little shift in&#13;
the demand curve, while the supply curve probably shifted backwards for the&#13;
OIDC-s as depicted in Chart 4.&#13;

Market observers had predicted for 1981 a marked upturn in spreads&#13;
for OIDC borrowers, given that these countries would have to come back to&#13;
the market to rebuild reserves, refinance maturing loans, and meet the&#13;
demands that an inflated current account deficit implies.      As a result it&#13;
was expected that the two-tier market observed in 1980 - with industria-&#13;
lized countries securing markedly different terms from those of OIDC's -&#13;
would become more pronounced in 1981.     Actually, although the demand for&#13;
loans has undoubtedly increased for the reasons cited above, the supply of&#13;
funds, which was constrained by unfavorable bank sentiment, *has improved&#13;
towards the OIDC's with only a few country exceptions.        This change in&#13;
sentiment has reflected the success with which most OIDC borrowers have&#13;
accommodated  the second oil shock.      In many cases successful economic&#13;
adjustment policies were introduced. Chart 5 depicts the projected outcome&#13;
for 1981.&#13;

Spreads rise slightly (s 8-s   ) as does the volume of lending (q -3&#13;

The Impact of Banking Constraints&#13;
Before considering the outlook for banking flows into the mid-&#13;
1980s,  it is necessary to examine whether there are any upcoming con-&#13;
straints likely to impinge upon the banks' willingness or ability to lend&#13;
to the OIDC's.&#13;
It is suggested that the falling profitability of international&#13;
banking, or more specifically the declining returns available relative to&#13;
risk, is one factor that may cause banks to hold back from the market.&#13;
Although the long-term trend in spreads may be downward, 1/ and although&#13;
low spreads are mitigated only in part by high short-term interest rates&#13;
(which endow them with a high return on their capital), it is clear that&#13;
the long-term profitability of a bank's entire relationship with an OIDC&#13;
may be the factor of key importance. The entire relationship takes in such&#13;
profitable business as foreign exchange dealing, trade financing, etc.&#13;
Although the loan loss record has been very good in the past on&#13;
international lending (compared with domestic lending), concerns have been&#13;
expressed that the exposure of some banks overseas is becoming excessive&#13;
relative  to domestic   lending.    In the short    term some   banks  heavily&#13;
involved in international lending have reportedly found their share prices&#13;
quoted at a discount, which hampers any attempt to raise new equity. There&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
is evidence to suggest, however, that whereas overall bank exposure to&#13;
OIDC-s is large, the lack of structural uniformity of the countries within&#13;
the OIDC category ensures that lending risk is well diversified. 1/&#13;
Declining capital ratios have been cited as another possible con-&#13;
straint on banks. Inflation has had a significant impact on capital ratios&#13;
in some countries.   2/  This is probably the least potent of influences on&#13;
bank lending in the short term, although it is perhaps of more significance&#13;
in the long run.    Ascertaining whether capital is adequate for banks has&#13;
different meanings in different banking systems. 3/ The possible relevance&#13;
of capital adequacy to OIDC borrowing stems from two important balance-&#13;
sheet relationships.    The first of these is on the assets side, between&#13;
country lending limits (either internally set or externally imposed) and&#13;
capital.   On the liability side, banks are concerned about their total&#13;
liability growth relative to capital as well as the relationship between&#13;
their potentially volatile deposits (deposits from, say the CSOEC's) and&#13;
capital.&#13;
On the assets side there is a question of "country limits." 4/&#13;
There is no formal definition of what these limits should be, although in&#13;
the United States regulators have a ruling that loans to one borrower must&#13;

not exceed 10% of captial surplus plus retained earnings; this does not,&#13;
however,  apply to countries.      Banks'  internal country   limits are not&#13;
published, and there is no way of analyzing how far the market itself is&#13;
"up to its limit."    Undoubtedly limits are being reached for some banks&#13;
with some countries, and further extensive borrowing by those countries&#13;
would require an expansion of the number of banks wishing to take on their&#13;
exposure.   Some banks may have reached limits for certain countries in&#13;
specific categories of lending (to a specific type of entity, for instance)&#13;
or maturity of loan, which brings with it the possibility of heavier&#13;
concentrations of lending at short term. Concentration of OIDC debt in the&#13;
shorter maturity range could of itself be a worrisome development.&#13;
Overall, however, there is no strong evidence to suggest that "country&#13;
limits" are either a general or lasting constraint on banks' activities.&#13;
A further set of constraints emanate from the monetary authorities&#13;
in the industrialized economies. The first of these relate to proposals to&#13;
control the growth of the Eurocurrency markets through the introduction of,&#13;
say, reserve requirements on Eurocurrency deposits.     This would involve a&#13;
very high degree of international cooperation in an area where there is&#13;
considerable international disagreement on the usefulness and feasibility&#13;
of  such  controls.     The  intellectual   underpinnings  of  the  need   for&#13;
Euromarket controls were weakened by the fact that recycling has proceeded&#13;
very smoothly in the wake of the second oil shock, as it did after the&#13;
first. Attempts by the United States to get agreement to a form of reserve&#13;
requirement have accordingly been shelved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
There does seem to be some measure of agreement among the central&#13;
banks in the industrialized countries that there is a need for greater&#13;
transparency in international banking flows and closer prudential surveil-&#13;
lance.  Moves have been made in the Cooke Committee 1/      towards requiring&#13;
banks to report their activities on a consolidated basis, thereby permit-&#13;
ting closer scrutiny of a bank's entire operations by banking supervisors.&#13;
Some analysts have argued that in the long run this might place some con-&#13;
straint on the ability of banks to extend international loans. 2/&#13;
Recent moves by the U.S. authorities to establish an offshore bank-&#13;
ing zone in New York may be construed as an attempt to encourage the repat-&#13;
riation to the United States of dollar banking business and hence in the&#13;
longer run permit closer surveillance of banking business.&#13;
Prospects for International Banking Flows&#13;
In much of the literature the possible constraints on banking&#13;
intermediaries   are  overemphasized.    Whereas   some  of  the  constraints&#13;
undoubtedly do constrain certain banks and impinge on specific country&#13;
borrowers at particular times, it is misleading to suggest that there will&#13;
be a' general constraint on banks that will act so as Ito cut off abruptly&#13;
the supply of funds to the OIDC's.      Even a prospect of default that, it&#13;
might be thought, would ensure a cessation in the flow of funds need not&#13;
prove unduly worrisome, for banks have quite profitably rescheduled the&#13;
borrowings of countries that have run into financial difficulties. Pruden-&#13;
tial controls, meanwhile, by creating a more stable environment for banking&#13;
business, could encourage, not discourage, flows of funds to the OIDC's.&#13;
1/ For a brief history of international banking supervision, see Develop-&#13;
ments in Cooperation among Banking Supervisory Authorities," Bank of&#13;
England quarterly Bulletin (June 1981).&#13;
2/ The German authorities, for instance, are gaining greater control over&#13;
the activities of German banks in Luxembourg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Although the data for gross medium-term syndicated lending to&#13;
OIDC's has shown some fluctuation over time, net Euromarket lending 1/&#13;
(which includes short-term Lending) has exhibited a steadier annual rate of&#13;
growth in excess of 20% a year over the past four years, and this at a time&#13;
when many commentators had expected banking constraints to become binding.&#13;
OIDC borrowers are becoming more sophisticated, too, recognizing that the&#13;
best time to borrow is not when the need is greatest 2/ (for bankers' risk&#13;
perception is at its greatest then) but when market conditions are easiest.&#13;
The prime determinants of banking flows are not the constraints&#13;
discussed above, for there is a strong propensity for banks - unconstrained&#13;
by county limits or capital considerations - to enter or reenter this mar-&#13;
ket and thereby overcome the market constraints.    Experience over the past&#13;
year suggests that when market conditions are tighter a small rise in&#13;
spreads may be sufficient to encourage potential lenders to the market. 3/&#13;
The key determinants of banking flows are the macroeconomic ones,&#13;
and as far as future developments are concerned the persistence of large&#13;
surpluses among the CSOEC½s - together with relatively sluggish growth and&#13;
hence slack loan demand in the major industrialized countries - means that&#13;
banking intermediaries will continue to have a major role to play in&#13;
channeling funds to the OIDC's.      The strong desire by banks to inter-&#13;
nationalize their business as a means to diversifying their portfolios&#13;
ensures that the banking intermediation process becomes effective.        The&#13;
Middle East banks have entered the international banking markets and have&#13;
1/ BIS data - see Table 6.&#13;
2/ See Stanyer and Whitley, "Financing World Payments Balances," Bank of&#13;
England Quarterly Bulletin (June 1981).&#13;

Prospects, 1981," IMF Occasional Paper, No. 7 (August 1981), pp. 17-18.&#13;

become very active in injecting new capital into the systems, while banks&#13;
from the developing countries themselves are waiting in the wings.      Until&#13;
such time as the world's banks have restructured their portfolios and&#13;
attained the "desired" balance of OIDC exposure in their portfolios, it is&#13;
possible to envisage increases in net bank lending of the order of 20% a&#13;
year.   In terms of the simple supply and demand model explored above, this&#13;
would imply continuous outshifts in the supply and demand curves until such&#13;
time as portfolio balance has been reached. Thereafter spreads might rise&#13;
more permanently for OIDC borrowers as the demand shift exceeds the supply&#13;
shift.&#13;
Prospects for the External Bond Markets&#13;
As shown in Table 7, very little external finance has been&#13;
obtained by the OIDC's in the foreign and international bond markets in&#13;
recent years despite efforts to provide greater access to these markets. 1/&#13;
There has been very little overall growth, and that issue volumes have held&#13;
up reflects innovations in the market: the growth of floating-rate notes,&#13;
convertible   bonds,  and  numerous  other  hybrid   instruments.    Although&#13;
international interest rates could decline from the historical peaks&#13;
registered recently, prospects for a permanent return to low interest rate&#13;
levels is bleak. The prospective interest rate environment therefore seems&#13;
likely to make access to international fixed-rate markets sporadic.&#13;
Domestic bond markets will continue to be dominated by the demands of the&#13;
industrialized country governments themselves, which will be seeking&#13;
non-money-creating finance to square their high levels of expenditure with&#13;
monetary stringency.&#13;
1/ The World Bank/IMF Development Committee set up a working group in June&#13;
1975 to examine the impediments to developing country access to the&#13;
capital markets and to suggest ways in which access might be promoted.&#13;
See the Secretariat of the Development Committee document, "Developing&#13;
Country Access to Capital Markets" (Washington, D.C., November 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
It therefore seems likely that the OIDC's will have to rely&#13;
heavily, in the period up to 1985, on financing from the private banks if&#13;
concessional financing does not respond sufficiently to cover the large&#13;
current account deficits likely to ensue.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            From an analysis of borrowing experience
            by oil-importing developing countries, it is concluded that
            in recent literature on private capital flows too much
            emphasis has been placed on the constraints on banking
            intermediaries. The key determinant of flows through banking
            markets is the macroeconomic environment (the orientation of
            global current account balances, the state of domestic loan
            demands in the industrialized countries, etc.) that
            influences the supply of funds to the banks. The banks
            themselves are strongly motivated to intermediate
            internationally by a desire to diversify their portfolios
            and by the profitability of international business broadly
            defined. Constraints do impinge on particular banks and
            particular borrowers at certain junctures, but for the
            market as a whole these constraints will not be severe as
            long as there are groups of banks--the Middle East banks are
            a current example--with an abundance of capital and an
            undiversified portfolio that are willing to establish a
            market presence. Prospects for greater access of the
            OIDC's to the fixed-rate international bond markets
            will remain bleak so long as high and variable interest
            rates persist and the public sectors in the industrialized
            countries continue to preempt large volumes of fixed-rate funds.
