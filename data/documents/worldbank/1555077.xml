FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS: AN EVALUATION OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to review the evolution of family planning&#13;
policy and program activity in those countries in which there is now an of-&#13;
ficial family planning policy as well as some program activity, and to discuss&#13;
the role of family planning programs in promoting declining fertility rates.&#13;
The events leading to adoption by governments of family planning policy are&#13;
discussed. Primary emphasis is given to reviewing the role of the private&#13;
sector in family planning which helped initiate and promote open discussion&#13;
of family planning; provided the first, limited family planning services; and&#13;
fostered informational exposure of the general population. These activities, it&#13;
is maintained, helped to de-sensitize populations to the emotional nature of&#13;
family planning. Additionally, adoption of family planning policy was influenced&#13;
to an important extent by the ability of each country to collect and analyze&#13;
population data as well as to recognize the implications of these data for&#13;
socio-economic development. Public and private efforts in this regard are&#13;
discussed. The development of family planning programs in the context of&#13;
institutional developmeints and delivery systems is traced. With regard to&#13;
these, staged changes have occurred in relation to program responsibility,&#13;
(gradual movement of the program from predominantly private sector responsibility&#13;
to predominantly public sector responsbility), in service approach (gradual re-&#13;
orientation of family planning service from being primarily clinic based&#13;
--clinical approach-- to the use of an outreach approach and most recently an&#13;
inundation approach), and in service delivery (changes in: types of personnel,&#13;
types of contraceptives, and response to changing demands for family planning&#13;
services). A discussion of the dynamic response of policy and program to changes&#13;
in demand for family planning services (specifically reduced demand) serves as&#13;
a point of departure to discuss evaluation of the contribution of family planning&#13;
programs to fertility decline. Evaluation in the strict sense faces significant&#13;
problems when applied to family planning programs to ascertain their inherent&#13;
"success" or their role in general in changes in fertility.    However, application&#13;
of the concepts of supply and demand to family planning services provides a&#13;
qualitative rationale for the importance of both family planning programs and&#13;
socio-economic development in explaining the apparent reductions in fertility&#13;
which have occurred. The paper closes with an illustration of the main points&#13;
discussed through a series of 7 country case studies.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
The past 30 years have witnessed an increasing interest in population&#13;
matters due to the unprecedented increase in the rate of population growth,&#13;
especially in developing countries. Increasingly, these countries have&#13;
realized the consequences of rapid population growth for their development&#13;
efforts and some of them have adopted measures of fertility control. Evidence&#13;
of success in those efforts was slow in coming, but it is now clear that&#13;
fertility is beginning to decline. The reasons for the fertility decline are&#13;
not yet well established, but some groups attribute the      decline to the&#13;
effect of family planning programs while others insist that it is the result of&#13;
socio-economic development. This paper contends that both sides are correct.&#13;
By showing how government family planning policies have been adopted and&#13;
programs implemented, it highlights the importance of these actions on the&#13;
supply of services. The paper underscores the importance of research, of the&#13;
multi-approach to service provision, of private groups and of socio-economic&#13;
development in improving the supply of contraception and abortion.&#13;
Events Leading to Government Adoption of Family Planning Policies&#13;
Official adoption of family planning policies and programs in&#13;
developing countries was prec=ded by a great deal of activity on the part of&#13;
private physicians and private groups and by much discussion of the rationale&#13;
for government involvement. The activities of private groups demonstrated&#13;
that there was a market for family planning and that most of the population&#13;
was not opposed to the provision of family planning services. Private groups&#13;
which developed the initial service delivery system and gave impetus to&#13;
research formed a pressure group to make governments adopt such a policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These groups therEfore, have been important in the adoption of policies,&#13;
although with some variation of degree from country to country.&#13;
The activities of private groups, however, were not sufficient to&#13;
make governments adopt family planni:ng policies. Countries adopted policies&#13;
only after clearly realizing that their population growth rate twas increasing&#13;
and that excessively high rates of gro;.'i would have negative consequences for&#13;
their socio-economic development0   Addti.:onallyD policies could be adopted&#13;
only after the opposition, be it reYZ.3-ous or political, had been quieted.&#13;
Data gathering and research efforts were very important: those countries&#13;
which had a long tradition of census taking and adequate research capabilities&#13;
or received aid in analyzing the results of their censuses were the early&#13;
adopters of family planning policies0 The analysis of data was particularly&#13;
important in encouraging the adoptioni of family planning policy since it&#13;
promoted a recognition of the consequerces of population growth0 To some&#13;
extent, this also explains wihy policy adoption is somewhat related to&#13;
socio-economic development0 Census-taking and research usually imply&#13;
resources for those activities and therefore may explain why proportionally&#13;
more middle-income countries than low income countries have adopted family&#13;
planning policies0&#13;
Other factors mediated agairst the adoption of family planning&#13;
policy in some nations0 Certain counfries had to overcome beliefs regarding&#13;
the importance of a large population for development, colonization of empty&#13;
lands or even a role in world affairs. Othcars had to contend with&#13;
political opposition    which branded famnily planning efforts a conspiracy of&#13;
the developed world against the developing countries, and the religious opposition&#13;
opposing family planning on moral gounds. More importantly, perhaps, may have&#13;
been the belief (fueled in part by the intecpretation of research results)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
that the population problem could be solved by socio-economic development&#13;
only. The controversy led to considerable pressures from internal and&#13;
foreign sources for and against the adoption of family planning policies in&#13;
most developing countries, and these pressures in their turn have either helped&#13;
or deterred policy adoption.&#13;
The existence of only thirty-five developing countries with a policy&#13;
including fertility decline as an objective is evidence that all the hurdles&#13;
have not yet been overcome. Most of the countries with policies to reduce&#13;
fertility are in Asia (seventeen) where the population problem was first&#13;
realized and where opposition, political or religious, was not so strong. Only&#13;
nine countries in the Americas have adopted a policy with demographic objectives,&#13;
perhaps because of the role of the Catholic Church. In Africa only eight&#13;
countries have adopted a policy with similar objectives, perhaps because the&#13;
seriousness of the problem is not as yet evident. One country in Oceania&#13;
(Fiji) completes the list of countries with family planning policies to reduce&#13;
fertility.&#13;
Adoption of policies proceeded slowly. By 1960, only four countries&#13;
had official policies; by 1964, six more had joined the club; in 1965, five&#13;
others did so. During the second half of the 1960s thirteen countries&#13;
adopted family planning policies, and so far only seven countries have done&#13;
so during the 1970s.&#13;
Several factors may be behind the adoption of family planning&#13;
policies in the thirty-five countries with policies: the activities of&#13;
private groups, research and data-gathering efforts, and the capacity in&#13;
some countries to identify their problems and take action linked to the level&#13;
of socio-economic development. These elements explain in part the absence of&#13;
policies in many other countries, particularly the poorer ones.&#13;

The concept of family planning services and, therefore, the programs&#13;
themselves have changed dramtatically since the early programs in developing&#13;
countries were initiated. These programs faced a number of constraints.&#13;
Programs had to be incorporated into the particular institutional setup of the&#13;
country, they had to be designed ut'lizing the kInown technology of the tim-,&#13;
and they began to operate on the assumption of excess demand. The experience&#13;
of those countries prompted innovation in the field that was useful in both&#13;
the countries where these ideas were developed and later on in other countries&#13;
just beginning family planning activities.&#13;
Institutional Development. Family planning activities in most countries have&#13;
gone through three basic organizational phases in their development. Initially,&#13;
these activities,which were totally in the hands of private groups, generally&#13;
did not have demographic objectives and were operated under loose administrative&#13;
arrangements without much accountability or evaluation.&#13;
The second phase, adoption of an official policy by a country, usually&#13;
led to the formation of a policy-making body, such as a National Population&#13;
Council. Under this body and for program implementation purposes, there was&#13;
reliance either on private groups financed by the government or a body in the&#13;
government, usually within the Ministry of Health, to provide services0   In&#13;
some cases there was an effort at integrating family planning services with&#13;
health services, but in most cases this did not occur immediately. Integration&#13;
of services is the third phase, therefore, and usually came only after a&#13;
categorical approach had proven less than successful. The initiation of&#13;
activities on the part of governments brought some important changes with it&#13;
regardless of the organization utilized. In the first place the objective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
of fertility decline was clearly defined; secondly, the idea of accountability&#13;
was clearly established; thirdly, targets were set and evaluation procedures&#13;
established; and, finally more efforts were initiated to improve performance.&#13;
The first official efforts in family planning were relatively&#13;
unsuccessful. Targets set tended to be over-optimistic; the ready,&#13;
potential acceptors were already utilizing the services of private groups and&#13;
the delivery system in existence was not adequately geared to provide services&#13;
to an unmotivated population. Lack of integration between health services and&#13;
family planning services was perceived as one of :he organizational problems,&#13;
and on this basis programs have moved increasingly in the direction of&#13;
integration. More importantly, however, governments began efforts to modify&#13;
the delivery system.&#13;
Delivery Systems. The delivery of family planning services has developed&#13;
over time from the single service provided on request at a physician's office&#13;
to the highly complex system in use today in the most developed programs.&#13;
This improvement in the delivery system has come about from the need to:&#13;
(a) motivate people to reduce their fertility, (b) inform them about the&#13;
services available, (c) convert them into acceptance of family planning&#13;
services and, finally, (d) insure that they become continuing users. Four&#13;
basic activities have been identified to do that job, namely, motivation,&#13;
information, prescription and follow-up. These four activities are now&#13;
characteristic of most family planning programs in developing countries.&#13;
Perception of the need toexecute those four activities has changed&#13;
over time and has been the fundamental factor in developing different&#13;
approaches to the provision of services. Three main approaches to the&#13;
provision of family planning services have been adopted: (a) the clinical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vi&#13;
approach is facility based (including mobile units) and utilizes medical and&#13;
paramedical personnel to provide information and prescription activities and,&#13;
in some cases, follow-up activities; (b) the outreach approach is client-&#13;
oriented, usually implying home visiting, initially for motivational and&#13;
informational activities, later including follow-up activities, and recently&#13;
adding the precription activity; (c) the inundation approach, utilizing&#13;
commercial shops or lay personnel.has as a basic activity that of resupply&#13;
and is useful for distribution of contraceptives not requiring prescription&#13;
or medical intervention. A number of secondary approaches have also been&#13;
utilized, but the above three constitute the basis of any modern delivery&#13;
system in family planning0&#13;
The above developments can be better illustrated on a chronological&#13;
basis. In the 1940s and 1950s when private groups initiated the delivery of&#13;
family planning services, the only basic activities were the provision of&#13;
information and prescription to already well-motivated persons. Services were&#13;
provided by a physician and only traditional methods of contraception were&#13;
available.&#13;
Initiation of government activity brought some changes, although&#13;
not immediately. Early government efforts were patterned after those of&#13;
private groups0 Later on, however, lack of enough clients brought about the&#13;
need for motivational activity and, still later, the perception of high&#13;
drop-out rates made it necessary to begin follow-up activities0 By the mid-&#13;
1960s the number of countries with an official policy had reached fifteen;&#13;
the introduction of the IUD had intensified the need for the clinical approach,&#13;
but also indicated the need for follow-up activities and therefore the&#13;
acceptance of the outreach approach utilizing paramedical personnel for&#13;
follow-up and motivation0 More efforts were made at evaluation and research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vii&#13;
was intensified to understand the determinants of fertility and to improve&#13;
the delivery system.&#13;
A few more countries adopted policies in the late 1960s. In the&#13;
delivery system the popularization of the IUD and expanded use of the pill&#13;
gave more importance to both prescription and follow-up activities which,&#13;
while emphasizing the importance of the clinical approach, marked also the&#13;
consolidation of the outreach approach. The acceptance of the condom as a&#13;
program method also produced the first efforts to provide contraceptives&#13;
through personnel other than the physician and therefore the initiation of&#13;
the inundation approach.&#13;
In the 1970s doubts were raised about the effectiveness of family&#13;
planning to reduce fertility because there were no clear signs of fertility&#13;
decline in those countries which had provided services for several years.&#13;
The idea that socio-economic development by itself could produce better results&#13;
was gaining influence and this may have constrained the growth of a number of&#13;
countries adopting family planning policies. Supporters of family planning&#13;
were not, however, giving up hope. The activities needed to provide&#13;
effective services were well established; the approaches to the provision&#13;
of services were clearly expanded to include inundation and a few countries&#13;
liberalized the laws on abortion and encouraged the acceptance of sterilization.&#13;
The increased popularity of the pill and condom, plus side effects produced by&#13;
the IUD and the absence of appropriate clinical back-up,contributed to the&#13;
IUD's reduced importance. The modern delivery system, as we know it today,&#13;
reached maturity and is now widely acceptable by the population in general&#13;
and by governments in particular.&#13;
During the past several years only a few innovations in delivery&#13;
systems were launched, such as the introduction of a new contraceptive--the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
viii&#13;
injectable--and trne increased acceptance of pns-dical pyreonol to ;_0-&#13;
the pill and insert IUDs.  On the othsr hsnd, the gfgit PneinfuW. sWad       to&#13;

p.ticularJ   those countries utilizing a multi-approach to the dGlivery of&#13;
servizes anJ   L.ose whiL have had a policy for come time.&#13;
Policy and Program Response to Reduced Demand&#13;
The development of family pr-grams have also included a change on&#13;
the part of governments to the problem of reduced demand0 The initial family&#13;
planning efforts were based on provicion of sarvices to clients on a purely&#13;
voluntary basis. Since the efforts of private groups did not usually have&#13;
demographic objectives and were   limited, they were frequently  confronted with&#13;
excess demand. Governments, trying to reduce fertility and to cover a wide&#13;
market,found that services available were in excess of the de-and0   To&#13;
convince the population of the advantages for the individual and the coomunity&#13;
of limiting family size, motivational activities were added to family planning&#13;
programs. This effort, however, was not sufficient to produce the desired&#13;
reduction in fertility and governments had to adopt other measures0&#13;
Four different types of measures have been tried by governments&#13;
in the search for improved program results0 First, they have utilized&#13;
payments (incentives) for the acceptance or practice of contraception and&#13;
in a few cases, on an experimental basis, payments for the limitation in&#13;
the number of births0 Second, to discourage large families, they have made&#13;
legal provisions such as increasing the minimum legal age of marriage, limiting&#13;
paid maternity leave to only three or four children, charging graduated fees&#13;
for in-hospital delivery increasing with the number of children a woman bea$D,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ix&#13;
and limiting the number of exemptions for income tax purposes. Third,&#13;
governments began making more efforts to improve the socio-economic&#13;
environment and therefore create conditions more conducive to the demand&#13;
for contraception. Finally, governments have tried to utilize peer pressure&#13;
to persuade people to practice family planning. In at least two cases,&#13;
some coercion has been utilized, but in one of them this appears to&#13;
have contributed to the fall of the government.&#13;
The development of family planning programs has been associated&#13;
with a great deal of frustration, but this frustration has led to more&#13;
research, with positive results. Only after research helped to promote&#13;
and test new delivery systems, has assistance been provided to secure accep-&#13;
tance and proper adaptation of new ideas in the field. Research has also,&#13;
to some extent, helped these interests in family planning recognize that&#13;
the market for family planning, as any other market, depends on both supply and&#13;
demand. In this sense, research has been instrumental imt expanding the scope&#13;
of family planning policy to convert it to population policy, including both family&#13;
planning services to improve supply and legal and socio-economic measures&#13;
to affect demand.&#13;
At least in the research into the delivery system, private groups&#13;
have played a very important role. They have taken the risk of advancing&#13;
new ideas, trying them on an experimental basis, discarding them if they&#13;
were not workable and propagating them when they are effective. Not known&#13;
for their research capacity, the private family planning groups have acted&#13;
primarily as demonstrating agents, sometimes developing trial projects and&#13;
taking the risk of failure. The role of private groups in this work has&#13;
protected governments against taking that risk themselves and will likely&#13;
continue to be important in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Family Planning Programs and Fertility-Declnp-&#13;
Government family planning programs have been subjected to more&#13;
evaluation efforts than any other social program. Theae efforto have not,&#13;
however, provided satisfactory answers to the basic question, nuesly, what&#13;
is the contribution of programs to the decline of fertility now evident in&#13;
many countries. Several problems of evaluation are responsible for this&#13;
state of affairs and a possible solution is now within sight.&#13;
The importance of evaluation of family planning programs originated&#13;
with supporters of such programs who wanted to demonstrate to skeptical&#13;
governments how effective these programs could be. Soon, the problem of the&#13;
availability of reliable data became evident. Hiost developing countries&#13;
did not have good systems of vital registration and many had not even taken&#13;
a census. This obviously made difficult the measurement of fertility and&#13;
the realization of changes in this variable. The situation has improved&#13;
somewhat in this respect, but still is not fully satisfactory. The early&#13;
efforts at gauging changes in fertility from program service statistics also&#13;
met with difficulty, because in their efforts to show success some family&#13;
planning workers did not report data accurately, making this information&#13;
invalid0&#13;
A second problem, even when reliable data were available and fertility&#13;
changes could be measured, was that of identifying the reasons for the decline.&#13;
Several factors such as change in age structure, changes in age of marriage&#13;
and the prevalence of sterility, among others, may affect the birth rate&#13;
independently of the practice of contraception or abortion. Although some&#13;
efforts have been made to solve this problem, it is now clear that in countries&#13;
having large fertility reductions the practice of contraception is usually&#13;
the most important factor. Considerable research still needs to be done to&#13;
identify properly the role of each factor in the decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xi&#13;
The above problems have been complicated, oddly enough, by research&#13;
efforts into che determinants of fertility. This research has tended to&#13;
attribute changes in fertility to socio-economic development independent of&#13;
program efforts. Lately, however, it has been recognized that socio-economic&#13;
factors are the prime determinants of the demand for contraception and&#13;
abortion, while program efforts are the basic determinants of the supply of&#13;
services. As in any other market, supply and demand.jointly and simultaneously&#13;
determine the market for contraception and abortion. This statement of fact&#13;
is not to deny that socio-economic development, through its effect on other&#13;
variables such as the age of marriage, may affect fertility or that program&#13;
efforts may include measures to increase the demand for family planning&#13;
services. What it says is that most of the large declines 'in fertility have&#13;
been brought about through the practice of family planning afld that in this&#13;
respect both socio-economic factors and program efforts play an equally&#13;
important role.&#13;
More importantly, there is at present enough evidence to&#13;
demonstrate that there has been a significant reduction in fertility during&#13;
the last twenty years. Among the sixty-three low and middle income countries&#13;
with populations of five million or more in 1976 considered in this paper, and&#13;
containing about 95 percent of the population of the developing world, fifty-one&#13;
showed a reduction in the birthrate between 1960 and 1977. Twenty-seven of&#13;
those with a birthrate reduction between 1960 and 1977 showed a reduction&#13;
of 10 percent or more. Only one of these twenty-seven countries was without&#13;
a family planning policy (the Democratic Republic of Korea). Among countries&#13;
with a policy, large reductions in birthrate (10 percent or more) were&#13;
more common among countries whose policies had a specific objective to reduce&#13;
fertility than among countries with a policy without a specific objective to reduce&#13;
fertility. It is only fair to say that,among the sixty-three countries&#13;
considered, the proportion of countries with specific policies including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
demographic objectives incKs@@si Bwith the level of per capita income, perhaps&#13;
because relatively rich counCea have    a better capacity to develop effective&#13;
programs. The wost successful countioo are in seneral countries where the&#13;
policy was adopted relatively early and   hoafreors have had some time to de2elop&#13;
their programs. They are countries sith a nuiti-approach to the delivery of ser-&#13;
vices, utilizing a wide variety of contgracctivs Eethods and utilizing a&#13;
variety of govermental and private agenciso to deliver those services.&#13;
It can be concluded therefore, that both a poUitive socio-economic&#13;
environment and a wel1-developed fa&amp;ily plannint proFvam have been instrumental&#13;
in the success of countrize in reducing their sertility. These factors&#13;

FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS: AN EVALUATION OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
The past 30 years have been accompanied by an increasing interest&#13;
in population matters around the world because of the unprecedented increase&#13;
in the rate of growth of population. Increasingly, developing countries&#13;
have come to realize that continuation of the hiUh rate of growth will make&#13;
their development efforts more difficult. Subsequent to this realization,&#13;
several governments have adopted policies and have implemented programs&#13;
of fertility control. Until recently, the results of those measures did not&#13;
show positive results on a scale wide enough to assure the world that adoption&#13;
or intensification of those measures could reduce the rate of growth of popu-&#13;
lation.  More recent data, however, have demonstrated a perceptible decline&#13;
in birth rates in a large number of developing nations. While this has produced&#13;
renewed optimism for efforts to reduce fertiltiy, there is still some doubt&#13;
about the reasons for the fertility declines. On one hand, the supporters&#13;
of family planning programs claim full credit for the decline; on the other&#13;
hand, some researchers argue that it is the improvement of socio-economic&#13;
conditions that has brought reductions in fertility. It is the contention&#13;
of this paper that both sides are correct: bearing in mind that supply&#13;
and demand act simultaneously and with equal weight to determine the market,&#13;
socio-economic conditions have increased the demand for contraception and&#13;
government programs have increased the supply of services. This paper&#13;
attempts to show how official population programs have influenced the supply&#13;
of and, in some cases, the demand for contraception. This is accomplished&#13;
by reviewing the events leading to the adoption by government of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
policies and programs in family planning, the deve.opment of family&#13;
planning programs and the evidence suggesting that programs along with&#13;
socio-economic development contribute to a lower fertility. A concluding&#13;
section reviews the implications for future program development.&#13;
II.    EVENTS LEADING TO GOVERNMENT ADOPTION OF FAiKILY PLAkNNING POLICIES&#13;
Official adoption of family planning policies and programs in&#13;
developing countries was preceded, in most cases, by a great deal of&#13;
activity on the part of private physicians and private groups and by a&#13;
great deal of discussion on the rationale for government involvement.&#13;
Initial interest in the provision of family planning services was expressed&#13;
in some countries as early as the l920/ ( e.g., India), but service provi-&#13;
sion was mainly in the hands of private physicians who provided services&#13;
on request from their own offices to highly motivated persons for a&#13;
regular fee. The provision of this service, however, was beneficial&#13;
only to a few persons who were sophisticated enough to take advantage of&#13;
such services and affluent enough to pay for them.&#13;
Soon groups of physicians and women social workers, helped in&#13;
some cases by sociologists, economists and demographers, began to realize that&#13;
many people would be interested in the services if they were offered on a&#13;
more open basis and at low cost. This constituted the recognition of a&#13;
demand and set the stage for an increased supply. Private groups opened&#13;
clinics to provide information and services in family planning. These&#13;
services, which utilized a clinical approach, were usually concentrated in&#13;
Il/ For more details see Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
--3-&#13;
large urban centers, and were offered on a purely voluntary basis.&#13;
Physicians were the prov.iders of services; and, in the first efforts,&#13;
contracep-ie meoJhods were very limited because the modern method - pill,&#13;
IUD and inijectabLe - were noc yet developed and the most effective methods&#13;
of the time - sterilization and the condom -- were not yet generally accept-&#13;
able to society.&#13;
The ptivate sector was instrumental in the eventual adoption by&#13;
governments of family planning policies and programs.   Several reasons&#13;
account for this. First, private efforts, more often than not, demonstrated&#13;
that there was a large demand for services amoag the population. Given&#13;
the limited capacity of private groups to provide services, they were, usually,&#13;
confronted by eccuss demand. Second, private groups d'emonstrated that the&#13;
population in general was not opposed to the provision of family planning&#13;
services and that, in fact, the population accepted easily the existence of&#13;
family planning clinics and encouraged the opening of addtional ones. Third,&#13;
private groups developed the initial delivery system that would become the&#13;
backbone of most present official programs. The clinical approach utilizing&#13;
physicians to provide services has been utilized by most family planning&#13;
private groups, and with important modifications, is utilized today in most&#13;
government family planning programs. I.nitial program activities did not&#13;
include other approaches because, giver, the excess demand for services, the&#13;
clinical approach was quite sufficient at the time. Fourth, private groups&#13;
became the driving force behind research efforts,and although those groups&#13;
have not been known for their research capability, they have stimulated other&#13;
institutions to initiate research projects by providing ideas, identifying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
crucial areas and in a few cases providing financial support. After&#13;
government adoption of a program, these private groups have continued their&#13;
influence on research by introducing new ideas in the field, testing them&#13;
and providing governments with the results so that those new ideas can be&#13;
integrated in larger scale programs. Fifth, private groups, through their&#13;
success, have been able toin-fluence governments into at least considering&#13;
the adoption of a family plfHnning program in their respective countries.&#13;
The success of private acti4vity in terms of acceptors, research, and&#13;
acceptance was certainly basic to the decision by governments to Dlay a&#13;
significant role in the rovision of services.&#13;
Countries' decision to adopt family planning programs came usually&#13;
after a great deal of debate on the need for the provision of services,&#13;
considerable political and religious opposition and some degree of pressure&#13;
from both local and foreign groups. The most important problem has been&#13;
that of identifying the need for services. Private groups had seen the&#13;
need for services as a meaRs to protect the health of mothers and children&#13;
and as a way to facilitate e4xercising the basic human right of people to&#13;
decide on the number and tiiming of their children.&#13;
For governments, the initial rationale was the-rapid growth of&#13;
the population and the possible implications of this for economic develop-&#13;
ment. Based on this, governments did not consider the possibility of a&#13;
family planning policy for their countries until they became aware of the&#13;
accelerating rate of population growth. This first stage only took place&#13;
when censuses or demographic surveys could demonstrate clearly that the&#13;
rate of growth in the country in question was accelerating. For some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
countries in South and Southeast Asia, this was not too difficult because&#13;
they had a well established tradition of census taking. By contrast for&#13;
countries in Africa, South of the Sahara, the lack of demogr. ic data has&#13;
proven to be one of the main obstacles in convincing governments of the&#13;
existence of the problem.&#13;
Awareness of increases in the rate of population growth has faci-&#13;
litated but not insured the adoption of a government policy. The next step in&#13;
policy and program development has centered on the debate whether rapid&#13;
population growth will affect the development process and whether development&#13;
in itself will not finally bring down the rate of growth without&#13;
a government family planning program. On the first of these two questions,&#13;
agreement is already widespread that rapid growth in population does generally&#13;
affect, negatively, the prospects for economic development. But this agreement&#13;
was not reached easily; a larger population was seen in several countries as&#13;
a larger market that would permit the development of local industry and&#13;
therefore stimulate economic development; a larger population was seen also as&#13;
a means to colonize empty lands in countries with relative low population&#13;
density. These views as well as other views claiming that-a large population&#13;
means more international power, even if it deters development, have now been&#13;
quieted.&#13;
On the second question, the debate still continues. Up to the late&#13;
1960's, it was believed in many sectors that widespread provision of family&#13;
planning services would immediately bring out a large number of acceptors&#13;
and users and reduce fertility quickly. The fact that this did not happen in&#13;
countries which had adopted programs early: the beginning of an emphasis on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
the study o. the determinants of fertility-and the reAuction in fertllity in&#13;
some developing ccuntries before programs were offici.11y adopted- (e.g. Rapub-&#13;
lic of China)   began to casr doubt on whether family planrning programs did&#13;
have a role to play. Emphasis was then shifted to socio--economic development&#13;
as the main engine of fertility decline. This conviction reached its peak in&#13;
the Bucharest Population Conference in 1974. Although much credence is still&#13;
given to this belief, a more balanced view is now b3eginning to emerge as&#13;
economists begin to use econoaic tools to analyze the market for family planning.&#13;
They are beginning to see that,in this market as in. any other, -3upply and&#13;
demand jointly determine the market. Socio-economic development, in a basic&#13;
senses, determines the demand function9 family planning programs, as initially&#13;
conceived, determine the supply function. The most important question now&#13;
appears to be    whether demand for family planning has to wait for orderly&#13;
socio-economic development to take place or whether the basic behavior of the&#13;
population, which affects the immediate variables influencing fertility, can be&#13;
changed in the absence of mo-;e rapid development than is now possible. That&#13;
this later position is being accepted is evident from some governments' policies&#13;
to expand the content of far-U.y planning programs to include measures specifi-&#13;
cally designed to change people's attitudes towards fertility and therefore&#13;
affect the demand function.&#13;
Other constraints were ideological aLd came from both political and&#13;
religious groups. Political groups argued that family planning was an imposition&#13;
from industrialized countriee which did not want the developing world to develop&#13;
and compete for scarce resov7ces. The populat-ion problau according to this thinkin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
would be automatically solved only after social change occurred. Religious&#13;
groups opposed family planning on moral grounds. Political opposition has&#13;
been somewhat assened by family planning efforts in socialist countries such&#13;
as in the People's Republic of China; and although it has slowed efforts to&#13;
adopt a policy in some countries, it has not stopped them completely. The&#13;
religious opposition has certainly slowed the efforts in some countries and&#13;
stopped them completely in other countries.&#13;
The above constraints to the development of a family planning&#13;
policy are evident in the different positions taken by different countries.&#13;
Although many countries, covering a majority of the population of the world,&#13;
have adopted policies including specific demographic objectives, some countries&#13;
have only gone as far as adopting policies and providing services with the&#13;
objective of protecting mothers' and childrens' health or only to allow people&#13;
to exercise their basic human rights, but without specific demographic objectives.&#13;
In some cases, governments have provided services without officially adopting&#13;
a policy.&#13;
Governments have also been subjected to internal and external&#13;
influence in favor of adopting a family planning program. The internal&#13;
influence came from family planning associations and academics in the fields&#13;
of economics, sociology and demography. They applied their influence through&#13;
research and teaching. Influence from external sources was sometimes more&#13;
overt and also more controversial than those exerted by internal groups.&#13;
External groups usually exercised their influence through research in the country&#13;
and through their contacts with senior government officials. During these contacts&#13;
evidence demonstrating the need for providing services was presented and help of-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
fered to get those countries on the way to establish family planning programs.&#13;
TMe development of government policies around the world has been&#13;
assilsted b-y i±terna-ationatl .1onors vie research studies, encouragement, techni-&#13;
cal assiskr,rce and f fnancial assistance.  The international donors can be&#13;
clag;sified in L-Vree d1istirict groups, namely: the voluntary private groups, the&#13;
bilateral. agen,ci; and the multilateral agencies.  Among the voluntary groups&#13;
tbe most. import-at are-  (a)  the International Planned Parenthood Federation&#13;
(YP?F), founded in 1952 as a federation of Family Planning Associations which&#13;
were the outgrowth of sout! of the private groups in each country; (b) the&#13;
Population Council, which also beganL activities in 1952 and has helped research,&#13;
training and in general the expansion of programs; (c) the Ford Foundation,&#13;
which in 1952 began supporting research and training in population; and&#13;
(d) the Rockefeller Founrdation, which has financed research, training and&#13;
experimental programs since early in this century.&#13;
Among the bilateral agencies, the most important in terms of&#13;
financial support have been the United States Agency for International Develop-&#13;
ment (USAID), the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), and the&#13;
Norwegian Agency for Internationial Development.  The Governments of Canada,&#13;
Germany, Japan and the Unifted Kingdom have also contributed substantially to&#13;
the development of population programs.&#13;
The most important multilateral agencies in the field of population&#13;
are the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the World&#13;
Bank.  Both of these agencies began activities in population in 1968.   In&#13;
addition, other multilateral agencies such as UNDP, UNESCO, FAQ, WHO and&#13;
UNICEF have contributed greatly to the population field by providing technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
and other types of assistance.&#13;
Table 1 presents a summary of the countries that have adopted&#13;
family planning policies including specific demographic obje    .ves, showing when&#13;
activities by private orgaiized groups began, when government supported&#13;
activity began, when policy was adopted and when implementation of that policy&#13;
was started.   In   eleven of the thirty-five countries in the Table, there&#13;
was some family planning activity by or before 1950. By 1960, twenty-three of&#13;
these countries had family planning-activity,and in at least twelve of those&#13;
countries there was formal government activity,even if only in four of them&#13;
(Pakistan and Bangladesh were only one country at the time) was there an&#13;
official policy. Before 1965, only ten countries adopted an official policy.&#13;
Of these ten countries seven were in Asia, two in North Africa and one in&#13;
Oceania. During 1965, five more countries (three in Asia, one in Africa,and&#13;
one in America) adopted official policies. From 1965 to 1970, the number of&#13;
policy adoptors grew by thirteen, of which five were in the Americas, four in&#13;
Asia and four in Africa. Only seven more countries have adopted official&#13;
policies since 1971,and of these, three are in America, three in Asia and one&#13;
in Africa. In total,therefore, Asia is leading the way with seventeen&#13;
countries, America follows with nine countries, Africa has eight and Oceania&#13;
has one. In terms of coverage, Asia is well ahead - it not only hasa higher&#13;
proportion of its countries with official policies, but those countries are&#13;
also the largest in the continent. Latin America and the Caribbean follow&#13;
with a mix of small and large countries. African countries with policies, on&#13;
the other hand, constitute only a small proportion of the African countries&#13;
and also cover only a small proportion of the African population.&#13;

Adoption of a family planning policy with demographic objectives&#13;
has not necessarily implied activity in the field on the part of a govern-&#13;
ment and the la    of such a policy has not deterred some governments from&#13;
providing services. As shown above in Table 1, some countries such as Ghana&#13;
and Senegal in Africa have adopted policies with demographic objectives, but&#13;
have not taken effective action to implement those policies. Furthermore,&#13;
some countries that have adopted policies have taken some time before clearly&#13;
establishing a program to provide services; Nepal and Morocco fall into&#13;
this category. Other countries such as Singapore, Republic of China and Hong Kong&#13;
began encouraging the provision of family planning services long before they&#13;
had an open policy. Costa Rica and Chile, which have not adopted policies&#13;
with demographic objectives, have provided services for a long time and have&#13;
been very successful in reducing their fertility. Pakistan, on the other&#13;
hand, was one of the first countries to adopt a policy and to provide services,&#13;
but real success has not been achieved. In most cases,however, the&#13;
adoption of a policy has led to provision of services within one or two&#13;
years, and the results of those services have begun to be apparent within&#13;
another ten years. The cases of the Republic of Korea, Indot1tsia, Philippines and&#13;
Colombia are the best examples of this. The failure to adopt a policy, on the other&#13;
hand, has generally implied the lack of service provision and the consequent&#13;
lack of positive results. This situation is evident in most countries of&#13;
Africa and a large part of Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Adoption of family planning policias by developing coutriso only&#13;
began after the Second World War and has proceeded 5lolyo    Ueully the&#13;
adoption of policies has been preceded   by family plraming acti7ity in the&#13;
private sector, be it by individual physiciano or by private grouso0 Th5so&#13;
activities of the private sector have coatributed to the adoption of policies&#13;
by demonstrating the existence of a need for services, the acceptability of&#13;
thoce Services by the populationsand the feasnibility of a dclLvery Oyotm-&#13;
Through research and example, they have also put pressure on gov@BnetS fow&#13;
a cleag statewsnt of policy. This, in many cases, hoDevnz, h9s not been&#13;
enough for governwents to take an open stad in favor of faemily planning0&#13;
Auarensse of a high rate of population growth, awareness of the conequences&#13;
of continuing that high rate for some timse and relazation of t-ho opposition&#13;
to femily planning bye political and religious groups appear to be important&#13;
elemeats in moving countries toward the adoption of a policy. The adoption&#13;
has not implied service provision in some comuftries; iE others, ths lack of&#13;
a policy has not been a constraint for service provision1 in wOst, however &#13;
policy generally imlies service and no policy implies lack of serviceso&#13;
Adoption of a policy, therefore, appears to be, in gseegrls a preTrequisite&#13;
for service provision and for the achievemaent of a country's desographic goalso&#13;

III.    DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENT FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS&#13;
The concept of family planning services and, therefore, the&#13;
programs themselves have changed dramatically since the first programs in&#13;
developing countries were initiated. The first programs were faced with a&#13;
number of contraints including lack of experience. Programs had to be&#13;
incorporated into the particular institutional set-up of the country, had&#13;
to be designed utilizing the known methodology of the time, and began oper-&#13;
ation on the assumption of excess demand. The experience of those pioneer&#13;
countries was difficult, but it resulted in a number of innovations in&#13;
the field. These innovations produced better programs in the countries&#13;
where they were devised and also formed the basis for better initial pro-&#13;
gram development in countries beginning family planning activities later.&#13;
The evolution of programs over time has probably made the difference in&#13;
the context of program results.&#13;
Institutional Development&#13;
Family planning activities in most countries were initiated by&#13;
private physicians or private groups of concerned citizens. Generally, these&#13;
private groups operated in a very loose way with few constraints on their&#13;
activities, without much accountability and without much concern for&#13;
performance in terms of demographic objectives. The objectives of private&#13;
groups have been to provide needed services to the communities within certain&#13;
legal boundaries and with limited budgets. Whether fertility declines were&#13;
achieved or to what extent they were achieved have not been the province of&#13;
private groups. Services were provided wherever a market was thought to exist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
If after a time the demand did not materialize, services could be closed&#13;
or moved without problem.&#13;
The initiation of family planning programs on the part of&#13;
governments brought about some organizational changes. In some cases,&#13;
governments began by supporting the private groups on the basis that those&#13;
groups had the experience in service provision and, until the governments&#13;
could organize their own services, it was better not to disturb the delivery&#13;
system in effect. Governmental support for private groups brought with it&#13;
a demand for more accountability on the part of the private groups, the&#13;
establishment of specific targets to be reached, the expansion of activities&#13;
to wider areas of the country, and stricter evaluation procedures. To&#13;
complement this arrangement, some countries also established some form of a&#13;
National Population Council for policy making and for coordination of the&#13;
activities of the different private groups providing family planning services.&#13;
This was essentially the pattern in countries like Mauritius, Barbados,&#13;
Pakistan  and Colombia.&#13;
A different pattern was followed by countries such as India,&#13;
Egypt, Tunisia and Mexico where responsibility for service provision was&#13;
given to the Ministry of Health almost immediately after policy adoption. This&#13;
brought about even more government control over use of funds, coverage of the&#13;
program, target setting and evaluation. Again in most countries there was&#13;
a semi-autonomous institution such as a National Population Council to&#13;
formulate policy and coordinate the efforts of the Ministry of Health with&#13;
those of other institutions within and outside government. In some cases&#13;
the takeover by the government was not total; information and training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
activities were sometimes left in the hands of the private groups because they&#13;
had more experience,and the Ministries of Health did not want to deal with&#13;
information -:mpaigns in which they did not really believe.&#13;
Assumption of family planning services by the Ministries of Health&#13;
did not usually imply integration of services until the late 1960e and&#13;
early 1970s. In some cases, the Ministries of Health provided family planning&#13;
services as an independent service within a separate division of the Ministry,&#13;
but without much coordination with other health services. This situation&#13;
occurred either because the health branch of the Ministry was too busy with&#13;
health activities or not interested in those services, or simply because the&#13;
program was not considered sufficiently important to receive high priority.&#13;
Although using health facilities, this system generally implied additional&#13;
personnel or additional payments to regular health staff for family planning&#13;
services rendered.&#13;
Regardless of the institutional arrangements made, initial govern-&#13;
ment efforts in family planning were not successful in reaching the targets&#13;
set for those programs because: (a) the targets had been set on the basis&#13;
of the limited experience of private groups and were therefore overly&#13;
ambitious; (b) the most ready acceptors were already practicing contraception&#13;
utilizing the services of private groups; (c) potential new acceptors resided&#13;
far away from large urban centers and were more difficult to reach; (d) the&#13;
integrated public health services and family planning services, needed by&#13;
many of the potential acceptors, did not really exist; and (e) the Ministries&#13;
of Health in charge of the services are in most developing countries weak&#13;
institutions, not high in the priority list of government,and are medically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rather than managerially or economically oriented. As a consequczee of the&#13;
above, the efficiency of governoent scrvices wee not very high.&#13;
Becoming   increasingly awerseE of  omen of thes probhleia  Bovernm&#13;
ments pursued a greater integration of fslily planning services with health&#13;
services generally and more specifically with intsEral and child health&#13;
services. The administration of family planning servicse iS now coming under&#13;
the umbrella of the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) division of the Ministry&#13;
of Health in most countries and family planning Services are considered an&#13;
integral part of MCH activity. Along with these chageso   there     been a&#13;
move toward establishing more realiotic targets for the programs, increasing&#13;
the emphasis of the motivational activity in service provision and identify-&#13;
ing the target population more clearly. These changes plus the importent&#13;
progress made in service delivery, appear to have accounted for the improved&#13;
results of programs.&#13;
Table 2 gives an idea of the institutional development in the&#13;
countries that have adopted family planning policies including demographic&#13;
objectives. It shows first the agency in charge of policy making and&#13;
coordination and then the agency or agencies in charge of implemsnting the&#13;
program. In most countries both of these functions are under the Ministry&#13;
of Health (MOH). In most countries, also, private groups participate in&#13;
service provision.&#13;
Also important has been the inclusion of other government ministries&#13;
in the provision of services. Ministries of Education have been integrated&#13;
in the program to provide population education through formal and informal&#13;
systems to individuals in and out of school. Also iinistries of Defense have&#13;

Delivery Systems&#13;
The delivery of family planyning services has developed over time&#13;
from the simple servicesprovided on request at a physician's office (charac-&#13;
teristic of countries without official programs and of those countries&#13;
pioneering family planning) to the highly complex system in use today in the&#13;
most developed programs. Gradual evolution has included changes in the&#13;
approaches utilized, changes in the activities to be executed, changes in&#13;
the personnel executing those activities, and changes in the contraceptives&#13;
available or utilized. This evolution and the increase in knowledge it&#13;
has brought have been motivated by low program performance. The conse-&#13;
quence of adapting the aew knowledge imr country prograns has usually meant&#13;
better performanen0  Once far3ly planning policies have been adopted, countries&#13;
have at the same time tended to adopt current e,rpertise in the delivery of&#13;
services. It is useful to review the development of that expertise in a&#13;
chronological way rather than in a functional or geographic way.&#13;
In most social environments, the population is divided among&#13;
five groups with regard to family planning. The persons in one of these&#13;
groups are completely unconcerned about family plaLining and do not have any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- i9 -&#13;
reason or motivation to control fertility.   This group of persons is likely&#13;
to be uninformed about the availability of services and is obviously not&#13;
practicing family planning. Persons in another group are motivated to&#13;
pracLice, but unaware of the services available and are therefore not&#13;
practicing famlly planning.   Persons in-the third group have already acquired&#13;
the necessary information, besides being motivated, but have not taken the&#13;
step of initiating practice of family planning. The fourth group is made of&#13;
persons who have accepted a method of contraception, but weaknesses in&#13;
their motivation or in the supply system place those persons at a high risk&#13;
of stopping practice or have already stopped them. Finally, the fifth group&#13;
people are active users of family planning. With some variations and subject&#13;
to changes in local circumstances, the above pattern is found in most develo-&#13;
ping countries today.&#13;
A comprehensive population program with the objective of reducing&#13;
fertility must include all the necessary activities to move a large&#13;
proportion of the population exposed to the risk of pregnancy toward the&#13;
fifth group. There are four distinct activities that can be carried&#13;
ouit to achieve that objective and which move persons successively from&#13;
the first to the fifth group. These are motivational activities, informa-&#13;
tional activities, prescription activities (including first provision) and&#13;
follow-up (including resupply) activities. Those countries which are&#13;
seriously concerned about their population problems have comprehensive&#13;
programs including the four activities.&#13;
The perception of the need to execute these four activities has&#13;
changed over time and has been a dynamic factor in developing different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
approaches to the provision of services. Three main approaches to the&#13;
provision of family planning services have been developed on this basis,&#13;
namely, the clinical approach, the outreach approach and the inundation&#13;
approach. The clinical approach is facility based (including mobile units),&#13;
and utilizes medical and paramedical personnel providing information and&#13;
prescription activities and sometimes followcup activities. The outreach&#13;
approach is client oriented, usually implying home visiting     I itially the&#13;
only activities of this approach were motivation and information; later on,&#13;
it encompassed follow-up andDbegining in the early 70s, it included prescrip-&#13;
tion of pill and insertion of IUD. The inundation approach, uszelly utilizing&#13;
day personnel or commercial shops has as basic activity that of resupply&#13;
and is useful only with contraceptives not requiring prescription or eurgTey0&#13;
A number of secondary approaches also exist. This classification of approaches&#13;
is not as clear cut as one would like it to be, but constitutes a rational&#13;
division of the numerous ways that have been devised to provide services.&#13;
The development of the three basic approaches has been determined&#13;
to a large extent by the availability of different methods of fertility&#13;
control and legal limitations in respect to their preicription, provision and&#13;
use. Development of new methods of fertility control, improved safety of&#13;
these methods and improved training, and supervision of w^orkers to prescribe&#13;
and distribute some of those methods have made possible the arrival of the&#13;
inundation approach, and therefore the provision of contraceptives on a mass&#13;
basis.&#13;
In the 1940a and 1950s when the first efforts at providing family&#13;
planning services began, most of the clients were highly motivated persons&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
who requested the services completely voluntarily and required only informa-&#13;
tional and prescription activities. The high degree of motivation of those&#13;
clients made it unnecessary to provide either motivational or follow-up&#13;
activities. The approach utilized at that stage was clinical; services were&#13;
provided by a physician in his own office or in a family planning clinic&#13;
belonging to a private group. Contraceptive methods were very primitive&#13;
compared to the ones existing today: pill, IUD and injectables had not been&#13;
developed sufficiently for commercial use, the condom and sterilization were&#13;
perceived as not acceptable to the population, and abortion was illegal as&#13;
it still is in most countries. The efforts were, however, very successful&#13;
in meeting their objective - the provision of a service. More often than&#13;
not, the demand met or exceeded the supply of services.&#13;
Initiation of family planning activities by governments did not&#13;
immediately bring a change in the above pattern. It was only after some time&#13;
that governments, having established nationwide programs,realized that there&#13;
was not sufficient demand for the services and that motivational activities&#13;
were of the utmost importance if the services available were to be utilized&#13;
-and the program targets achieved. The idea of changing people's attitudes&#13;
toward family planning focussed on the use of mass media and field workers&#13;
to convince people of the advantages of low fertility for both the individual&#13;
and the society. Also, the realization that clients accepted the practice&#13;
of family planning, but did not remain long as users pointed out the need&#13;
for follow-up activities to keep the clients motivated and resupply them when&#13;
necessary. The clinical approach, without many changes, continued at that&#13;
time to be the basic approach to the delivery of-services, especially in&#13;

activities became acceptable, mak:ing it             t to s.tend service while&#13;
saving the time of medical doctors for piresqy clinical activities. Finally,&#13;
governments became more conscious of the need for evaluation and the&#13;
identification of the weaknesses in the del-very system that made difficult&#13;
the achievement of targets. This awareness gave importance to evaluation&#13;
efforts and increased the number of experiental efforts with the idea of&#13;
finding ways to improve the delivery systemoL0&#13;
The number of cotutries adopting faEfly planning policies almost&#13;
doubled again by the late l9G%s.      t the oame tois e  renswed efforts were made&#13;

decline in some countries and the causes of program failure in others. The&#13;
delivery system also changed markedly during these years. The prescription&#13;
activity increased in importance because of the large scale introduction of&#13;
the oral contraceptive. Regulations in most countries established that this&#13;
new method could be prescribed only by physicians after appropriate medical&#13;
examination. The increased importance of the IUD and the introduction of the&#13;
oral contraceptive also made follow-up activities even more important than&#13;
before. This was especially true if the programs were to avoid the problem of&#13;
the acceptance-drop-out-and-reacceptance cycle which would absorb a large&#13;
part of service provision resources. While emphasizing the importance of the&#13;
clinical approach, the above changes also brought the consolidation of the&#13;
outreach approach with efforts aimed at increasing motivation, the dissemina-&#13;
tion of information and referral of clients to the clinic, and the first&#13;
attempts to deliver contraceptives through personnel other than physicians.&#13;
The increasing acceptance of the condom at this time made it possible for&#13;
family planning workers to deliver supplies door-to-door and for shops to&#13;
dispense them.&#13;
By 1970 there were serious doubts about the prospects for reducing&#13;
fertility decline through the provision of family planning services alone.&#13;
Changes in fertility were not yet observable in most of the countries that&#13;
had provided services officially for several years. The idea that socio-&#13;
economic development by itself was the reason for fertility levels was taking&#13;
shape and this idea continued growing during the early 1970s to reach its&#13;
peak at the World Population Conference in Bucharest. The defenders of family&#13;
planning were not, however, giving up hope. Although there were not many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
new additions to the club of cou trAce with o.f. mily p1nming policies,&#13;
there wse a high   level of activity in the              of osv'°c@e pcoviolon.&#13;
The activities needed to provide sefective servieso EsTs well&#13;
established. The approaches to thc pzovision of aervices were es panded to&#13;
include inundation, based on incrTeaing              of the condom and on Albera°&#13;

programs to encourage more wideSpread s    '-;   - of sterilizn0       A few&#13;
countries established telephone annswerg2   services to provide informtion on&#13;
family planning and the mails began to be utilized foz the recupply of&#13;
contraceptives. The great populaRity of the pill amd the condom1,     long with&#13;
the many side effects of the IUD amd the need for clinical bzc1xup for thio&#13;
method, began to reduce the IUD,s relative acceptance as the principal program&#13;
method.  The modern delivery systs3 aS we ECro it today had reached maturity&#13;
and was widely acceptable by the population in eaneral and by governments in&#13;
particular.&#13;
The last few years have seen few dramatic changes in the delivery&#13;
system but have provided the first meaningful rewards to the defenders of&#13;
family planning programs. In terms of the delivery system, the inundaticn&#13;
approach of making contraceptives available through all possible channels is&#13;
now accepted for both orals and condoms0    A new contraceptive, the injectable,&#13;
is now in use in a number of countries End    several countries are utilizing&#13;

-25 -&#13;
fertility in a large number of developing countries, with particularly impor-&#13;
tant reductions in those countries where multiapproach family planning programs&#13;
have been in action for several years. That the programs have made a&#13;
contribution to fertility decline will be the subject of Section III of this&#13;
paper.&#13;
The development of approaches to the delivery of services by&#13;
country is illustrated in Table 3. The popularity of each contraceptive is&#13;
illustrated in Table 4 which shows for each country with a family planning&#13;
policy,including demographic objectives, the two most popular contraceptives&#13;
during each period of time.&#13;
Policy and Program Responses to Reduced Demand&#13;
Private efforts at providing family planning services before govern-&#13;
ments adopt an official policy are usually insufficient to cover the demand&#13;
for those services. Governments, on the other hand, find that once their&#13;
services are provided nationwide, it is difficult to obtain enough clients&#13;
to use those services. The excess demand confronted by private groups has&#13;
often been a convincing reason for the establishment of government efforts,&#13;
but to the disappointment of government that ready excess demand has been&#13;
covered with little effort. When the first official family planning efforts&#13;
were established, the excess demand which was evident before the initiation&#13;
of government activity led to the setting of large targets. Failure to reach&#13;
these targets led to criticism of government efforts. In comparism govern-&#13;
ments adopting policies more recently have been cautious in setting targets&#13;

The efforts of private groups hava usually been@ concentTsted wher&#13;
the demand for services is large - generally in urban centers. Ymilure by&#13;
private clinics   to reach their objectives may cauce the clooing or moving&#13;
of the clinic to a more suitable environment0   The governmient, ¢ the other&#13;
hand, is expected to make services available even in places where the dew-ad&#13;
is small. This is of course an inefficient way to operate. To solve the&#13;
problem and help achieve desired demographic objectives, governpento havs&#13;
adopted several measures. The first and most important one(s     Pmentioned&#13;
earlier) was the effort to develop a better delivery system by givina&#13;
importance to motivation activity.  Other measures included the introduction&#13;
of new contraceptives in the program as they became available, utilization of&#13;
an increasing variety of personnel to provide services and mass media for&#13;
motivation and information, and expansion of the approaches to includs clinicaI,&#13;
outreach and inundation as many government programs are doing at present.&#13;
Acceptance of family planning was initially allowed to operate on&#13;
a purely voluntary basis. Services were provided only on request ith no&#13;
effort to convince anybody to practice contraception or reduce their fertility.&#13;
The introduction of the motivational activity as part of programs moved those&#13;
programs a shade away from pure voluntarism. By trying to convince potential&#13;
clients of the benefits of low fertility for themselves and for society in&#13;
general, the idea of pure voluntarism was being abandoned0 No objection could&#13;
be raised to the use of motivation simply because demand for any service,&#13;
product or even ideology depends on some type of motivational effort.&#13;
£stivational activities have not, therefore, besn coasidered in eny vey coercive0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Program improvements, including motivational efforts, have not been&#13;
sufficient to increase the practice of contraception and reduce fertility to&#13;
the level and within the time framework desired by many governments. Conse-&#13;
quently, four types of other measures have been adopted moving government&#13;
policies from the initial limited scope of family planning policies to more&#13;
comprehensive population policies.&#13;
The first of those measures is the provision of incentives. Incentives&#13;
types are numerous. Short-run payments for acceptance or practice of contraception&#13;
these have been in the form of small amounts of money or inexpensive gadgets&#13;
sometimes openly referred to as payments and at other times as compensation&#13;
for costs incurred while receiving services. Compensation for work time lost&#13;
has been an incentive utilized in India. Long-run incentives have also been&#13;
utilized, but only on an experimental basis up to now. These long run incen-&#13;
tives are more in the form of prizes for achieving low fertility. Educational&#13;
certificates inthe Republic of China and savings accounts in Tea Estates in India,&#13;
both examples of long-run incentives, were credited to women during their&#13;
childbearing years but redeemable only at the end of them and varying in value&#13;
according to the number of children delivered.&#13;
The second type of measures consist of legal provisions to discourage&#13;
large families. Examples of this type of regulation are: (a) the increase&#13;
in the legal minimum age of marriage adopted in many countries,as for example in&#13;
the Republic of Korea; (b) limitation of legal paid maternity leave for women workers&#13;
to three deliveries as in Singapore and Ghana; (c) limitations in tax exemptions&#13;
to only three or four children as in Korea and the Philippines; and (d)&#13;
giadtiated fees for hospital delivery of children, increasing with each child&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30&#13;
a woman be.--s-. These are only a few examples of many diverse la-s enacted&#13;
to help control fertility. The principal problem with these laws is that at&#13;
present  they may not reach the people with hihsr fertility (usually the puor)O&#13;
This derives from the fact that these people at riskt of high fertility (usually&#13;
the poor) are still outside the realm of z2rriage (i.e. as in Latin America),&#13;
do not deliver in hospitals, and/or given their low income are not subject to&#13;
tasation.&#13;
The third type of measures may iE the long run be more effective&#13;
and produce benefits beyond those of reducing fertility, This type of measures&#13;
is encompassed within the framework of socio-economic development, AS a large&#13;
number of research studies have shown that there is a significant correlation&#13;
between fertility and socio-economic factors, as measured by,inter alia,&#13;
levels of education, health care, urbanization and employment of women&#13;
governments are beginning to make an effort to improve the conditions of the poor&#13;
in the hope that improvement will bring about fertility decline, This effort,&#13;
no doubt, will bring an increase in the demand f'or family planning services,&#13;
while at the same time help to improve the living conditions of the poor,&#13;
The fourth type of measures is based on the assumptioD that pressure&#13;
of some kind will bring changed behavior among the population, Group pressure&#13;
has been utilized in the Republic of Korea with Mother's Clubs, in Indonesia with&#13;
,village community participation and folklo:ic representations that shame&#13;

people with many children, and in the People's Republic of China, where the&#13;
number and timing for a couple's children are practically determined by&#13;
the community. Although a step away from pure voluntarism, community pressure&#13;
is not usually considered bad in itself on the basis that a large number of&#13;
human actions are, after all, discharged because it is so determined by the&#13;
groups people belong to. Pressure, however, may lead to coercion. In India,&#13;
for example, it was alleged that men were being forced to have vasectomies.&#13;
Also in India, legislation was written but not signed by the President, stating&#13;
that men with more than three children who did not get a vasectomy could not&#13;
hold government jobs. Nonetheless, coercion is believed to have contributed&#13;
to the fall of the Government of Mrs. Gandhi.&#13;
As noted earlier, these types of measures have moved fertility&#13;
control from the sole purview of the Ministries of Health and the realm of&#13;
family planning into a more multisectoral concern and into the realm of&#13;
population planning. The above measures are relatively recent and have not&#13;
been enacted on a sufficiently widespread basis to have had a meaningful&#13;
role in the recent decline in fertility. Even if they had some influence, it&#13;
has not been evaluated. The types of measures adopted, however, offer a&#13;
glimpse of what governments may be ready to do in the future if ordinary&#13;
efforts to reduce fertility do not meet with success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This section has -eviewed thl developmnt £of fmaily plaan.n   efforts&#13;
in the developing world. It showed the movement of family planni3 from the&#13;
private sector, through the -overnnt organizations providing fawtily plannin,&#13;
services within or outs_. e cae Ministry of Health, to Coday's wVidely accepted&#13;
view that family plannin6 is an integral part of maternal and chilld health&#13;
services, and therefore the integration of family planning into these services.&#13;
The sectlion has also viewed improvements in the delivery of services&#13;
beginning with the pure clinical approach providing only information and&#13;
prescription of a few rudimentary contraceptives to the complex systems in&#13;
use today with clinical, outreach and inundation approaches, providing motiva-&#13;
tion, information, prescription and follow-up activities and utilizing a wide&#13;
variety of very effective contraceptives such as the pill and sterilization, and&#13;
with a freer environment for abortion.&#13;
The changes in governments' attitudes toward the problem and the&#13;
consequent measures those governments are willing to take to achieve their&#13;
objectives, have also been illustrated.   The day of absolute voluntarism has&#13;
disappeared from countries that take the problem seriously and has been replaced&#13;
with step-by-step multisectoral measures which approach coercion in some&#13;
countries. In the meantime, the term "family planning policy" has been replaced&#13;
by the more encompassing term "population policy" but this has had only slight&#13;
practical effect in changing the scope of family planning programs. The obvious&#13;
question in light of the above changes is whether family planning has produced&#13;
any results in terms of fertility decline or whethsr the efforts have been&#13;
wasted0 This ia therefore the subject of the followinE section0&#13;

IV.    FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMS AND FERTILITY DECLINE&#13;
Government family planning programs have been subjected to more&#13;
evaluation efforts than any other social program. Evaluation efforts,&#13;
however, have not provided satisfactory answers to the basic question,&#13;
namely, what is the contribution of programs to the decline of fertility&#13;
now evident in many countries. Within the framework of evaluation, the main&#13;
issue stems from those who attribute the reductions in fertility to family&#13;
planning programs as opposed to those who attribute the same reductions to&#13;
changes in the number of variables usually referred to collec-&#13;
tively as socio-economic development. There are several reasons why&#13;
solutions to this problem have not yet been found. These reasons, as well&#13;
as a possible solution to the puzzle, are discussed in this section.&#13;
The Problems of Evaluation&#13;
The importance of evaluation of family planning programs originated&#13;
with defenders of these programs who wanted to demonstrate to skeptical&#13;
governments how effective such programs could be. This was part of the&#13;
original belief that there was a very large demand for family planning&#13;
services just waiting for services to be supplied on a mass scale. This&#13;
belief, as noted before, originated in the relative large demand found by&#13;
private groups and was confirmed by the high incidence of abortion or by&#13;
answers given by women to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) surveys.&#13;
The expected rapid acceptance of services and consequent fertility decline&#13;
did not materialize, however, and whatever effects the programs had on&#13;
&#13;

- 34 -&#13;
fertility were difficult to measure and             it^'f tme Opzazs &amp;uon to&#13;
eeveral problems.&#13;
The first problem encountered in tt-he Ns ov.si-'viion 5gs ehs unzvftlability&#13;
of reliable data. In most developing cc=-trieso     to shoY through de p  ec&#13;

and of the need for better data brought Lovs5 ett-           to  "ove irapic&#13;
statistics. The census progrea of the United s.          D   o6gr&#142;  to iLmrovs vitel&#13;
registration systems in several countrisoD thne O5      r         of OsaKL?3.Se Curvte@y&#13;
and the development of techniques of    b:-Z6 tic. bsed on incomplete data ayre&#13;
examples of these efforts. The results o£¢ these o:.or2sD however, did not&#13;
materialize for several years. Estimates o- .t       ',s ratso have improved greatly&#13;
in many developing countries, but this ic a          wJ 'ep in the -; p-    of&#13;
data needed for precise analysis. Age-pecific f.ertllity rates, a .--re useful&#13;
measure of fertility, are still difficuls. to c;-te±   for   anny countrelms and&#13;
when they are available, they are usually outcated0Thse Lack of data to estimate&#13;
changes in fertility gave rise to the use of .,aamily planning progrsm service&#13;
statistics to evaluate the programs.    The efforte to achleve targets, howiever,&#13;
produced, in some countries, falsification of dats,, ralslng questions&#13;
about the reliability of these data also.&#13;
1/  See the various United Nations Demo   baphic Yserbook for an ide2 about&#13;
the problems with demographic data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
A second problem in evaluation, even when data are available and&#13;
fertility changes can be measured, is that of identifying the reasons for these&#13;
changes. Changes in the birth rate can be caused by changes in the age and sex&#13;
structure of the population, changes in the marriage rate, lactation practices,&#13;
the prevalance of sterility, intrauterine mortality, the frequency of inter-&#13;
course, and by changes in the practice of contraception and induced abortion.&#13;
Very few studies have been done to explain the influence of each of these factors&#13;
upon changes in fertility. Some efforts have identified for a few countries&#13;
the effects of changing age and sex distribution and of marriage rates on changes&#13;
1/&#13;
in the birth rate, but not much more . The evaluations of family planning&#13;
programs have estimated numbers of births averted as a consequence of contracep-&#13;
tive practice, but these efforts, as noted earlier, may have been vitiated by&#13;
defective data and assumptions and are, therefore, not fully convincing.&#13;
The above problems have been complicated, oddly enough, by the research&#13;
2/&#13;
efforts covered under the umbrella of "determinants of fertility" . These&#13;
research efforts have concentrated on finding the correlation between indicators&#13;
of socio-economic development and indicators of fertility levels and changes.&#13;
Unfortunately, this research has not considered the intermediate variables&#13;
that are affected by socio-economic factors, and in turn affect fertility. Not&#13;
much importance has been given, for example, to the relationship between&#13;

are consistent correlations between sccioeccuo-2kc indexEs and fertility indezesa&#13;
With few exceptions, researcz &gt;nto the ds    Sneenamts of fertility has&#13;
not included consideration of the avFla6il.:ty of. family plaming serviceso&#13;
This is surprising considering that   ieh reisich has bsen undertaken by&#13;
economists who, in studying the w_E,sskt fo' ntle.r goode and services, would&#13;
likely look into both supply and dem,r.&amp; funactionc. The approach utilized in&#13;
the case of fertility could be defendend on -,he baoSs that the contribution of&#13;
socio-economic factors iu made not jurst through contraception and abortion&#13;
but also through other variables. Cpz the other hand, it appears evident that&#13;
large reductions in fertility necessit.ate the uzactice of either contraception&#13;
or abortion.&#13;
The most important problem 4,S thece£fore that of attribution of fertility&#13;
reductions to different causes. On o.n,e extreme; the defenders of family&#13;
planning programs are quick to attribute any sli'.ght decline in fertility to&#13;
programmatic efforts. On the other side, the dsterminants-of-fertility group&#13;
tries to explain changes in fertility by cbanges in education, in health, in&#13;
status of women, in urbanization, t.c.     ?:-sb3y, both groups are at least&#13;
partially right, All that has to be done is to find out wnat part of the&#13;
decline in fertility is due to the ..c;:.c-. of contraception or induced&#13;
abortion. It can then be explained that socio-economic conditions determine&#13;
the demand for contraception and ind.ced    ortion  and that family planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
programs determine the supply of those services. Equality between supply and&#13;
demand simultaneously determines the market and both supply and demand are&#13;
equally responsible for the amount of contraceptive practice. The question of&#13;
whether it is socio-economic development or program efforts that determine&#13;
the level of contraceptive practice is simply not answerable.&#13;
Two points related to this problem need clarification. The first&#13;
one is that socio-economic factors may affect fertility without affecting the&#13;
demand for contraception. This can be done through effects on the age of&#13;
marriage and the proportions married, through effects on lactation practices,&#13;
the prevalence of sterility, and through effects on intrauterine mortality and&#13;
the frequency of intercourse. It is not clear, however, how these variables&#13;
work. If socio-economic development brings about an increase in the age of&#13;
marriage or a decrease in the proportions married, this effect may be compensated&#13;
by an increase in intercourse outside marriage. Socio-economic development&#13;
appears to bring about decreases in intrauterine mortality which would tend&#13;
to increase fertility through increasing the survival of children from concep-&#13;
tion to birth and tend to decrease fertility when the occurrence of one birth&#13;
delayed the time of a new pregnancy. The decrease in lactation and in&#13;
sterility brought about by socio-economic development will tend to increase&#13;
fertility. The effects of socio-economic variables on the frequency of&#13;
intercourse are not clear, but if there are any,they would tend to reduce&#13;
fertility by a small amount. This analysis would imply that the effects of&#13;
socio-economic development on fertility through variables other than contra-&#13;
ception and abortion are minimal.&#13;
The second point to be clarified is that family planning programs&#13;

fertility and that this reduction has been particularly significant in&#13;
countries with high marks for both socio-economic development and program&#13;
efforts; less significant for countries failing one of those tests; and that&#13;
there is no difference for countries failing both tests.&#13;
The Decline in Fertility in Developing Countries&#13;
The developing world, taken as a whole, experienced a consistent&#13;
increase in the rate of growth of population up to the late 1960s; there was&#13;
a stabilization at around 2.4 per cent per year during the next quinquenium and,&#13;
in the mid 1970s, the rate of growth dropped by about one-tenth of a percentage&#13;
point to 2,3 per cent, This decline does not appear dramatic at first sight.&#13;
The change of trend, however, is of tremendous importance in the history of&#13;
population, For the first time in modern times the rate of growth is declining&#13;
rather than increasing.&#13;
The continuous increase in the rate of growth had taken place because&#13;
of a continuous decline in mortality without a corresponding decline in&#13;
fertility. Fertility in developing countries remained constant or even increased&#13;
somewhat up to about 1960. Since then, fertility has been slightly decreasing&#13;
up- to the present. Mortality during the 1960s declined faster than fertility&#13;
and consequently contributed to the increase in the growth rate even when&#13;
fertility also declined. During the 1970s, however, because of the acceleration&#13;
in fertility decline and the slowing down in mortality decline, the rate of&#13;
growth has finally begun to decline. For our purposes, therefore, the&#13;
turning point came in the 1960s when fertility in the developing world began to&#13;
decline.&#13;

proportion of married women of reproductive age using contraception for&#13;
sixty-three countries. The countries in Table 5 are generally classified&#13;
as the developixiL countries, and the countries listed are limited to those&#13;
with a population of five million or more. Fotnote 1 of Table 5 identifies&#13;
all criteria applied for selecting the sixty-three countries included in the&#13;
table. It is of interest to note that the countries listed in Table 5 have&#13;
among themselves approximately 95 pexcent of the population of the developing&#13;
world or about 67 percent of the total world population.&#13;
Table 5 contains a great deal of information, some of which has been&#13;
put in a somewhat more compact form in Table 6. Table 6 shows that there are&#13;
family planning policies in forty-five of sixty-three countries. In twenty-six&#13;
of these a specific objective of the policy is fertility decline. In another&#13;
nineteen countries, fertility reduction is not a specific objective of the policy.&#13;
Eighteen of the sixty-three countries have no policy at all,&#13;
Table 6 shows that there is an association between the presence&#13;
(having a policy or not) and content (having a demographic objective or not)&#13;
of a family planning policy and the degree of reduction in the birthrate. Of the&#13;
forty-five countries with a policy, twenty-six had a large (10 percent or&#13;
more) reduction in birthrate. Among countries with a policy, large reductions&#13;
in birthrate (10 percent or more) were more common among countries whose policy&#13;
had a specific objective to reduce fertility (twenty of twenty-six) than countries&#13;
with a policy which did not spell out a specific objective to reduce fertility&#13;
(six of nineteen). It seems that having a specific demographic objective written&#13;
into the policy is related to large reductions (10 percent or more) in the birthrate,&#13;
while the absence of a specific objective to reduce fertility impeded the&#13;
reduction of the birthrate. It might be noted that of those six countries with&#13;
a policy including a specific objective to reduce fertility but which achieved&#13;
only small reductions in the birthrate we find:&#13;

gonQil only recently adopted a policy;       ,  1anyn and 8   aEn hrve bed&#13;
* policy since the mid-1960s but have made little progrecs in devoloping&#13;
a program; and Pakistan and Bangladesh programs have not achieved &amp;ny&#13;
significant succezso.  In comparison, there were soi  countries which had&#13;
large reductions (10 percent or more) in the birthrEte, but which were&#13;
countries with a policy not including a specific objective to reduce&#13;
fgetility (Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, and Cuba). XCt is&#13;
of interest to note that each of these six countries i{ Latin AmericGn,&#13;
is in the Eiddle income range and is predominately Cstholic.&#13;
By contrast, of the eighteen countries with no ft2ily pJLaninS policy,&#13;
only one had a large reduction in fertility (10 percent or more). This&#13;
country, the Democratic Republic of 7Co . still has no official family&#13;
pjlanning policy.&#13;
Table 5 also shows that large reductions in the birthrate (10 pemcent&#13;
ore more) are also associated to the level of income of the country. AmonS&#13;
ehe twenty countries with per capita incomes of $250 or less, three out of six&#13;
countries having policies with demographic objectives achieved a large reduction&#13;
in the birth rate. For the same level of income no country of five with policies&#13;
but no demographic objectives reached the same level of success. Xn countries&#13;
with per capita incomes between $250 and $1,000, eleven out of fifteen countries&#13;
with demographic objectives succeeded, and three out of eight with policies but&#13;
not demographic objectives achieved a large reduction in the birth rate. Among&#13;
countries with higher incomes the record is still better; five out of five&#13;
countries with demographic objectives and one out of six with policies but&#13;
no demographic objectives obtained a large reduction in the birth rate.&#13;
En only one country without a policy, the Democcatic Republic of Korea&#13;
with a per capita income of $670, was a large reduction in the birthrate&#13;
achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
That the decline in fertility is related to the practice of contracep-&#13;
tion is also shown in Table 5. A rule of thumb is that,if one assumes that&#13;
a birth rate of about 50 implies natural fertility in the absence of contra-&#13;
ception, then for each two percent of women of child-bearing age practicing&#13;
effective contraception the birth rate will decrease by one point. This rule,&#13;
of course, assumes that the women practicing are a random sample of all women&#13;
of child-bearing age in marital unions. This is not always the case and&#13;
therefore the required percentages will vary from country to country. As can&#13;
be seen in Table 5, however, the number of points that the birth rate was under&#13;
50 in 1977 is related to the percentage of married women of reproductive age&#13;
practicing contraception, although not clearly in the expected relation of one&#13;
to two.&#13;
The above simple analysis has indicated that large reductions in&#13;
the birth rate in the developing world have taken place mainly in countries&#13;
that have adopted policies with the specific objective of reducing fertility&#13;
and have implemented those policies, and that the amount of the reduction in&#13;
fertility is explained by the prevalence of contraceptive practice. This&#13;
explains the role of the supply of contraceptive and abortion services in&#13;
fertility decline.&#13;
It is also clear that the adoption of policies and the success in those&#13;
policies, once they are implemented, are related to the level of per capita&#13;
income in the countries and consequently to the level of modernization and&#13;
development. Although it is not established that countries adopt policies and&#13;
implement them in answer to an increased demand for services, it may be&#13;
hypothesized that,as development advances,people become aware of the possibi-&#13;
lities for self-improvement and of the possibilities of limiting their family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
size and begin demanding services at first frou the private s@ctoz and later&#13;
on from public health services. In view ol thio damand, yolitical lazdaES&#13;

channels. From this point of view, the policy decision may in itself be a&#13;
reflection of the demand for service@.&#13;
The above exercise was done only 0Zo countries sho-ing a IErgE&#13;
reduction in the birth rate simply so as not to claim reductioos where they&#13;
may be dubious. The data in the table aVeD houever, cooplets so avsilmble for&#13;

V   CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper has reviewed the process of adoption of family planning&#13;
policies, the development of family planning programs, and the contribution&#13;
of programs to fertility decline. We need, however, to consider the conclu-&#13;
sions of the review and its implications for the future.&#13;
The first conclusion is the importance of data collection and&#13;
research. It is clear that countries do not adopt family planning policies&#13;
and programs unless they are aware of the rapid rate of growth of population&#13;
in their countries and the consequences of that growth for socio-economic&#13;
development. In this type of research it is important to keep in mind the&#13;
cultural, social and economic background of the country in question and a&#13;
clear idea of the general development objectives of the government, particu-&#13;
larly in regard to the desired future standards of living, and the alternative&#13;
routes that can be followed to achieve those objectives.&#13;
Research has played and will continue playing a role in terms of&#13;
the improvement of regular programs. From past experience, it appears clear&#13;
that the market for family planning is not just one market for a particular&#13;
product or service. It is rather a conglomerate of markets for different&#13;
products and different services. A couple may want to practice family planning,&#13;
but unless the services are appealing to them, the services will not be used.&#13;
Research, therefore, will need to determine both what makes people desire to&#13;
limit their fertility and how they want the services to be provided. In&#13;
regards to the first, a number of studies have investigated the determinants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of fertility and have provided general idesa about macro-economic factors that&#13;
appea- related to fertility levels and variations in those levels. Little has&#13;
been dane to study the mental procecsss that intervene in the decision-making&#13;
process. A multidisciplinary approach to the solution, of this problem appears&#13;
to be needed. Moreove., it is likely that direct questioning of people in&#13;
this respect will produce better results rather than the indirect approach of&#13;
guessing fertility decisions from people's characteristics.&#13;
The answer to the questions "what services do people want" and "how&#13;
do they want them" is also important0 Up to now the approach has been essen-&#13;
tially trial and error0  Again, having people choose between possible alterna-&#13;
tives before implementing them may be an efficient way to find out what services&#13;
people want, at least in a general way before those services are tried0 Even&#13;
after the services are being provided ou a trial basis, it may be advantageous&#13;
to find out why some people utilize thoose services while other people do not,&#13;
gnd to try to find out ways to improve thoas cervices.   Experimsntation is&#13;
certainly very important, but should be done only after having determined&#13;
whether the general approach is acceptable to the population or not0&#13;
Finally, research has an importat role to play in evaluation, but&#13;
it must begin by recog nizing that, practice of family planning is a supply&#13;
and demand concern where the two simultaneously detemine the market and the&#13;
absence of one of them just means no practice. What is more important for&#13;
research is to find out how socio-ecomoaic factors affect the decision to have&#13;
a reduced fertility and to make that gresarch policy-oriented rather than&#13;
purely theoretical0 It is no use ktnouing thnt twenty more years of education&#13;
for everybody will result in lowez 2aEtility wh@en a country camnot afford the&#13;
coot o0 providing that level og education and cannot wait that long for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
desired effects. More important is to learn how education and other variables&#13;
affect decision-making, to study possible alternatives of producing the same&#13;
effects and then provide realistic policy recommendations. Researchin&#13;
population and family planning has had an important role to play in the past&#13;
and may have an even more important role in the future.&#13;
The second important conclusion is that programs to be effective will&#13;
have to cover as many markets as possible. The first family planning programs&#13;
to be implemented did not show positive results until an effort had been made&#13;
to increase the number of government agencies involved in the program, to&#13;
utilize all in the provision of a comprehensive a:ctivities service, to utilize&#13;
a number of different approaches and to utilize a wide variety of contraceptive&#13;
methods. As explained before, the market for family planning appears to be&#13;
a composite of several markets with several goods or services exchanged.&#13;
There is no question that motivational efforts are necessary for a large&#13;
majority of potential users. Many people will nort practice family planning&#13;
even if they are strongly motivated unless the groups to which they belong&#13;
approve of such practice. Community pressure, thWerefore, will undoubtedly be&#13;
helpful. Many potential acceptors are happy with the pure clinical approach&#13;
to family planning; others will require that approach only if accompanied by&#13;
health services; others, still, will only accept and practice if services are&#13;
brought to their place of residence or work-- the outreach approach. Many&#13;
more, however, may prefer the convenience of the"inundation approach if they&#13;
can obtain their contraceptives at a reasonable cost in as private a way as&#13;
possible. These approaches focus on the need for providing services appealing&#13;
to as many markets as possible. The final objective of every family planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
program should be eventually to fade away and for people to practice contra-&#13;
ception through the commercial system - basically, inundation. It may however&#13;
take many years before this stage is reached. In the meantime a multi-approach,&#13;
with multi-agency involvement is required for old, as well as new, family&#13;
planning programs.&#13;
The question of methods is also important. In the past, programs&#13;
emphasized only a few methods, either because no other alternatives were&#13;
available or because of program preferences. Expansion in the number of&#13;
methods, however, appears to have contributed to success. The main problem&#13;
with contraception is still that people have to decide "not to have children."&#13;
The road for the future is to discover a safe contraceptive that turns around&#13;
the decision-making, process that primarily makes the person "decide to have&#13;
children." This demands essentially a long-term vaccine. The present injec-&#13;
table goes some way in this direction, but it is still short-term and its safety&#13;
is not well established. Furthermore it is not reversible- The IUD.has&#13;
lost importance now because of the need for medical backup which frequently is&#13;
not-readily available ih developing countries. Sterilization is still consi-&#13;
dered a final method because in practice it is not reversible; until the ideal&#13;
contraceptive has been developed, however, it is necessary to make available&#13;
to the population, without unnecessary restrictions, the full range of&#13;
contraceptives now known plus abortion.&#13;
A third conclusion focuses on the role of private groups. The&#13;
principal-role of private groups in the past has been to provide a limited&#13;
amount of services before official policies were adopted and programs imple-&#13;
mented.  It is evident that in any country, regardless of the stage of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
development, there is a demand for family planning services. This market&#13;
has not been completely served by the private sector even when no official&#13;
services are available. The future should, however, be different.&#13;
There are a large number of countries without official policies or&#13;
programs; there are a few countries with policies but no programs; and even&#13;
a few countries with policies and programs that do not work. The private&#13;
groups can play an extremely important role in all of these countries, not&#13;
just to provide services but also to support the research needed to convince&#13;
governments of the importar.ce of the population problem. To do this, private&#13;
groups will need to discard the concept of "limited efforts"and expand&#13;
wherever necessary; they should begin focusing on fertility effects rather&#13;
than on pure service provision. Finally, they will need to become more&#13;
research oriented; the more proficient in research these groups become, the&#13;
more confidence people will have in their results and more impact on govern-&#13;
ments will be obtained. For this, private groups will need a great deal of&#13;
help from internal and external groups. The work will not be easy, but the&#13;
results may determine whether governments "grow" in the direction of population&#13;
programs or remain as simple observers while the problem grows in magnitude.&#13;
A fourth conclusion is in respect to countries with programs. It is not&#13;
disputed by anybody that countries which are better off in terms of per capita&#13;
income and In general socio-economic conditions have been more ready to&#13;
implement family planning programs. It is also clear that these countries have&#13;
been more successful with their programs. Among the group of countries with&#13;
per capita incomes of $1,000 or more, Brazil, Mexico, Iraq and Iran are the&#13;

appears to be pesent,D given the utilization of private sorvices and the decline&#13;
obosrved in the birth rate up to the   z        Provision of services on a wider&#13;
scale could have reduced the birth rate even Roze than up to now0&#13;
On the other extreme, is the story of the loow income countries w&amp;here&#13;
even with socio-sconoiiaic conditions not conduciva to high practice of contra-&#13;
ception, the presence of a stroig supply effort with motivationalez capaigns&#13;
such as in India and Indonesia, ind soms community pressure as in Indonesia, has&#13;
brought a large increase in practice and signifteant reductions in the birth&#13;
rate. Sri Lanka1, although at this level of income, is higher in socio-economic&#13;
development than other countries in the same group and therefore both factors&#13;
of supply and demand have been conducive to fertility decline.&#13;
An important lesson to be learned from the countries discussed aboveg&#13;
no matter how backward the country, some results can be obtained by establish-&#13;
ing strong programs, and regardless of how advanced the country is in socio-economic&#13;
terms1, if it has a high birth rate, the decline in that rate will be very slow&#13;
unless a supply system is established. This is something that countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
presently without programs, should consider with care.&#13;
Finally, governments adopting policies and implementing programs in&#13;
the past appear to have been too optimistic with regard to the presence of&#13;
demand and therefore promised achievements which later on could not be reached.&#13;
Furthermore, the rapid expansion of services nationwide has made those services&#13;
appear to be inefficient. For both old and new programs, it would be advisable&#13;
todetermine first and realistically the extent of the demand; second, to extend&#13;
services on a priority basis only where the estimated demand warrants the&#13;
services; and, third to set up targets that are achievable and will not discourage&#13;
the workers or providers of either technical or financial aid. This does not&#13;
mean that no emphasis should be put on family planning, it only means that&#13;
provision of services should be made on a rational basis.&#13;
In the 1950s and early 1960s, family planning appeared to be the only&#13;
solution to the population problem--and a rapid one. Expectations today are&#13;
more realistic. Policy-makers and program managers realize now that setting&#13;
up a working program requires several years and that achieving substantial&#13;
results takes a few more years. On this basis, the need for exaggerating likely&#13;
results no longer exists. The will to have a program working is certainly&#13;
more important than the promises made.&#13;

CASE STUDY: PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA&#13;
Policy Initiation and Evolution&#13;
Factors underlying the declaration of an official family planning&#13;
policy are obscure. However, impetus for the adoption of an official&#13;
policy may have been mediated by the facts enumerated below:&#13;
1949  In this year there was a feeling among the new leaders of&#13;
China that the country had too many people      Probably for&#13;
economic reasons as well as political considerations, the&#13;
leaders contemplated and planned for an enumeration of the&#13;
population.&#13;
. 1953 A national census was initiated.&#13;
. 1971 Chairman Mao advocated "Planned Birth", but he undoubtedly&#13;
influenced the development of family planning at an earlier&#13;
date 41&#13;
The results of the 1953 census were apparently a major factor in&#13;
illustrating the need for family planning, and probably were influential in&#13;
helping to lAunch an official family planning policy in 1956. The&#13;
policy cited the promotion of later marriages and birth limitation as ve-&#13;
hicles for achieving the socio-economically based goals of the population&#13;
policy41'74&#13;
Major setbacks to the fulfillment of the policy occurred. At the&#13;
outset of the Great Leap Forward in the early 60's and during the Cultural&#13;
Revolution of the mid and late 60's, the implementation of family planning&#13;
74&#13;
policy was halted   . As time has passed since the end of the Cultural Re-&#13;
volution, the family planning policy and program has been revived and has&#13;
been fostered by policy decisions which:&#13;

Family p'lanning activity seems to have always beep az`i..nistered&#13;
through a complex and intricate netwovk of political ard iidical systems.&#13;
This system was described around 1970-1971 by independeat eRuthors 4142&#13;
There are distinctly rural and urban components to family p'lannlng activi-&#13;
ty and each corresponds to the political framework of the    ural and urban&#13;

societies . The administrative units of the city (hiogher' to lowest)&#13;
are the districts, wards, and lanes or neighborhoods       L  the rural set-&#13;
ting, family planning responsibility rests vwith the leaders of the commune,&#13;
41,42&#13;
production brigades and teams         Oversight is providzd at all times by&#13;
the Communist Party to "revolutionary comittees".     Tvs Cov-ifunist Party&#13;
establishles policy, while the "revolutionary committee.&amp; execute programs at&#13;
each level in the society (e.g. national, urban, ruxal, locrl, etc) by&#13;
41&#13;
providing administrative and some executive function back.c-v. support&#13;
Within the context of the administrative organizatlon, local regis-&#13;
tration systems work well and facilitate the program on th_ local level.&#13;
However, at the national level, the vital statistics regI`i::cation system&#13;
has not worked efficiently and has made the administration of the family&#13;
planning program difficult.&#13;
. Delivery of Services&#13;
The development of the delivery of family planning sezvices occurred,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
apparently, during two periods of time in particular. With the declar-&#13;
ation of a family planning policy in 1956, a program was set in motion&#13;
which employed multiple approaches using multiple types of personnel.&#13;
Family planning activities were delivered in a variety of settings. Be-&#13;
tween 1971 and 1975, Mao's concept of "planned birth" (particularly local&#13;
target setting through community participation) came to fruition. None-&#13;
theless, since 1956 family planning activities have operated through&#13;
clinical, outreach and inundation approaches simultaneously in the context&#13;
of the political structure of the commune or production team.&#13;
All health workers (lay, paramedical, and medical; part-time and&#13;
full-time) may initiate and continue all family planning activities to&#13;
a varying extent. Health aides and midwives prescribe orals and other&#13;
conventional contraceptives (e.g. foams, jellies, etc.). Barefoot doctors&#13;
are trained in some cases to insert IUD's.&#13;
All forms of contraception are available; however, the IUD was fa-&#13;
vored during the 60's while the oral contraceptive is currently the most wide-&#13;
23&#13;
ly used form of contraception   . Oral contraceptives are available free of&#13;
charge. Other contraceptives can be purchased for a nominal charge.&#13;
23&#13;
Abortions and sterilizations are encouraged&#13;
Information and motivation activities are promoted primarily by word&#13;
of mouth, although radio messages are a common format for promoting family&#13;
planning.&#13;
In summary, a multi-faceted approach to family planning has existed&#13;
since program inception  in   1956.  With tke exception of program suspen-&#13;
sion during the Great Leap Forward' and' the Cultural Revolution, the only&#13;
change in the multiple approach came in the early 1970's with a refinement&#13;
of activity promoted by Chairman Mao and known as the "planned birth" move-&#13;
ment.&#13;

. Administration&#13;
Family planning services are provided in Colombia through: the MOH as&#13;
a part of the integrated health service; PROFAMILIA; ASCOFAME and by several&#13;
smaller, organized groups. This has presented difficulty in developing a&#13;
coordinated, consistent, and coherent organization for providing family plan-&#13;
ning services, although this arrangement does not appear to have adversely&#13;
affected the country's ability to provide services.&#13;
The MOH effort in family planning is an administrative part of and&#13;
integrated with the MCH services. The administrative organization of these&#13;
services corresponds to the organization of the MOH. A central office sets&#13;
the rules by which the policy is to be executed and operational units (hos-&#13;
pitals, health centers and posts) execute the program.&#13;
PROFAMILIA is organized around a clinic system, community distribution&#13;
programs (distribution posts) and special distribution programs (coffee&#13;
estates). These programs are centrally planned and directed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ASCOFAME is organized as a professional organization and is concerned,&#13;
primarily, with aiding the administration of educational programs through&#13;
established teaching institutions.&#13;
. Delivery of Services&#13;
Colombia is probably the only developing country where both the clin-&#13;
ical approach and the inundation approach were started simultaneously and&#13;
before the government bec6me involved in family planning. In 1965 both&#13;
of these approaches were initiated through a clinic system (staffed by a&#13;
physician, nurse, an auxiliary nurse, a motivator and a secretary) and a&#13;
network of distribution posts. Despite the distribution of pills and con-&#13;
doms by lay workers through the inundation approach, the IUD was and is&#13;
the most popular form of contraception.&#13;
In 1969 the KOH initiated family planning services integrated with&#13;
MCH services, but the clinical approach continues to be emphasized. Physi-&#13;
cians and paramedical personnel are found in the largest health facilities&#13;
(hospitals) and the smallest (health posts). Yet0 the latter of these also&#13;
have an "outreach" worker. Paramedical workers provide all services to some&#13;
extent0 Lay outreach fieldworkers are used to provide information, motiva-&#13;
tion, and referral services only.&#13;
PROFAMILIA services are supported by information and motivation activ-&#13;
ities back-up: mobile "motivators" and audio-visual programs. PROFAMILIA&#13;
and other family planning organizations run dozens of other large scale,&#13;

and the sale of contraceptive and -.nformational materials&#13;

two projects: a family planning clinic integrated into a pro-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
services through two clinics based in general practitioners'&#13;
offices. The GPPA was able to involve the GOG in these pro,ects.&#13;
In 1969 the GOG declared a family planning policy and in 1970 the GOG&#13;
launched ..t-; own program.  The policy is based on a socio-economlU  ration-&#13;
ale and has remained unchanged since 1969.&#13;
Development of Government Family P]anrring Program Activity&#13;
Administration&#13;
Since the inception of the family planning program, it has been co-&#13;
ordinated by the Ghana National Family Planning Program (GNFPP), a body&#13;
comprised of the Ministry of Health (MOH), the GPPA, and the Christian Coun-&#13;
cil. The program is administered by the GNFPP through the facilities of&#13;
all of these organizations. Services are offered in a categorica fashion,&#13;
although attempts have been made to integrate family planning services in&#13;
GOG facilities.&#13;
Delivery of Services&#13;
Up until and through the first year of the GOG program, family planning&#13;
services were provided through a clinical approach. Information and moti-&#13;
vation were provided by volunteers while other services were provided solely&#13;
by physicians at a fixed or mobile facility.   Since 1971 family planning&#13;
workers have been the main personnel to provide family planning services.&#13;
These workers do provide all services to some extent including prescription&#13;
and followup. Prescription by paramedical workers includes insertions&#13;
(which lost popularity after 1969) and distribution of oral contraceptives&#13;
(which became the most widely used contraceptive in Ghana after 1969).&#13;
The outreach approach began in 1971 with lay workers providing infor-&#13;
*Categorical is defined here as meaning that family planning services are&#13;
offered as a special program administered by the Ministry of Health - much in&#13;
the same way that malaria eradication programs are categorized and referred&#13;
to as "vertical programs".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65 &#13;
mation and motivation services in home visiting programs (primarily the&#13;
GPPA).&#13;
Although the inundation approach has probably been operating in&#13;
Ghana since at least 1969,chiefly through the 600 retail outlets of the Ghana&#13;
HCtional Trading Company, 1975 was the year of commitment to inundstion as&#13;
demonstrated by the GOG's invitation to other outside (non-government) whole-&#13;
salers to be distributors of contraceptives in Ghana.&#13;
Information and motivation activities have been nurtured through a&#13;
massive advertising campaign, Bamily life programs in 20 school systems, and&#13;
youth organization programs.&#13;

India more than any other country in the wocrld hzs been the leader,&#13;
both intellectually and logistically, in deve,?oPin5g e,;l.ori.ng and promoting&#13;
family planning practice. Family panr:.ng has heen : topi.c of -ntelalectual&#13;

or another by all of the deTa-loping rations whic'.: hEvse o3`icial policies&#13;
and programs of family plannr-ng.&#13;
Several factors made di-ficult the exF5ort to encou-ra.ge fa-.ly planning&#13;
among Indians. Although economists in gen-ral ..rc-ed femily planning prac-&#13;
tice, many of the economists who correctly est- Zlished the relationships be-&#13;
tween economic growth, social growth, and opw9*o7ion ,ro-th bel'eved that&#13;
industrialization would solve Indi.eas deve:cp ig popu:lation p-roblem. India's&#13;
vast social and physical diversity presented xpmy o7gani.ztiiona` difficulties&#13;
for the private sector in their attekmpts to pers7uede .'he Governrment of India&#13;
(GOI) to take an official and affinrzative stanOd on fE:,eily plann`ing policy and&#13;
program. Many of the clinics and grouos which foammed di7ring the 30's and 4Q0s&#13;
offered family planning services, bvt, found few clients a:t their doors. Per-&#13;
haps this situation was as much a result o: ioc socic economric levels as it&#13;
was a result of a lack of motivation and .info.omatior, but also technological&#13;
developments in the form of safe0 rel.iable0 and reversible contraceptive me-&#13;
thods were not yet available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Private efforts specifically aimed to make the leaders of India cog-&#13;
nizant of the consequences of excessive population growth apparently came to&#13;
fruition in 1940 when Nehru who had been appointed to prepare a national plan&#13;
for development mentioned in this document the need for a national family&#13;
44&#13;
planning policy  . Several key events occurred during the next 12 years, how-&#13;
ever, before either an official policy or program developed. These included:&#13;
. 1943 Health Survey and Development Committee appointed. In its&#13;
report issued in 1946, it stated that decreasing mortality rates&#13;
were accruing through disease control efforts and would ex-&#13;
acerbate the population growth rate. It advised a family limita-&#13;
tion policy.&#13;
. 1947 During this and the following year (just after Independence),&#13;
shortages -particularly of food - developed. A Planning Commis-&#13;
sion was appointed to study utilization of resources. A review&#13;
of health programs was made with the recommendation to start de-&#13;
velopment of a family planning policy.&#13;
. 1951 The GOI allocated funds to enable gathering of the information&#13;
needed to develop a population policy and program.&#13;
In 1952 a population policy was approved and evolved further in several&#13;
steps:&#13;
. 1952 Declaration of a policy.&#13;
. 1950's Initial funding for getting a program underway was approved&#13;
in 1952, but because no other countries had official family&#13;
planning program experience from which India could draw, the&#13;
family planning program in the 50's in India was characterized&#13;
primarily by research, strategy development and initiation of&#13;
some services in conjunction with existing maternal and child&#13;

1956  During the mid41950's a policy decisionr was made that acknow-&#13;
ledged that the GOI perceived famaily planning efforts to be in&#13;
need of more autonomy than the MON had allowed until this time.&#13;
Thus, the Family Planning Board was created in 1956e but as a&#13;
part of the MOH.&#13;
1960DS and 1970's  During these two decades there has been no devia-&#13;
tion from full commitment to the concept of family planning by&#13;
the GOI  ;      4  46   Policy decisions have dealt with pro-&#13;

Develojpment of Government Family Planning Program Activity&#13;
Administration&#13;
India has had a number of complicated administrative changes over the&#13;
past three decades.  The family planning program xays under the -urisdiction&#13;
of the Ministry of Health and Family Plzmnin£  NO)45 until :977 when it becaEs&#13;

with NCR services, The program was centrally qponaored, but ezecuted by the states,&#13;
States did bear a portion of the recurring cooto of the progrTea, In the latter part&#13;
of the 50's and through the mid 60's, efforts uere made to aive the Drogra&amp; more&#13;
autonomy but within the MOR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
This was effected through the Family Planning Board established in 1956.&#13;
With this change, the program took on more of a categorical flavor through-&#13;
ouL .he 60's.  In 1966 the central government assumed the full cost of the&#13;
,rogram; the program tended to be more centralized and categorical. This&#13;
situation lingered until about 1973 at which time the national development&#13;
plan redirected the fami.y planning program into an integrated health care&#13;
system    The family planning program today is still entirely centrally&#13;
funded, but executed by the states in GOI health facilities (including GOI&#13;
mobile units). The current organization of the program includes a Central&#13;
Family Welfare Council and the Department of Family Welfare. The former&#13;
defines policy and the latter executes the program in consultation with the&#13;
44                                                     44&#13;
state governments . The national structure is replicated in each state&#13;
The national marketing scheme of the Nirodh (condom) is organized by the&#13;
Department of Family Welfare as part of its activities in executing the&#13;
program.&#13;
. Delivery of Services&#13;
Matching the categorical nature of the program in the early years&#13;
through the 1960's, the family planning program was characterized by exhaus-&#13;
tive manipulation and experimentation with the clinical approach. Because&#13;
sterilization has been the predominant measure promoted in family planning&#13;
and because there is more of a feeling that this measure can be undertaken&#13;
most appropriately by a physician, the clinical approach has predominated.&#13;
Thus the program has been chained to facilities, both fixed or mobile (mo-&#13;
bile clinics were introduced in the early 60's) employing teams of physicians&#13;
(i.e. vasectomy camps). Apart frcm sterilization the traditional methods&#13;
of contraception were promoted.&#13;
The outreach approach to family planning has existed on paper practically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 731 -,&#13;
since the inception of the program. Fieldworkers had been trained in the&#13;
delivery of family planning services since the late 50's and probably continue&#13;
to be the most appropriate personnel for delivery of family planning through&#13;
the outreach approach. However, this has never been a strong program ap-&#13;
proach in India apart from its use in association with gaining sterilization&#13;
acceptors.  Added emphasis to this approach might occur with popularization&#13;
of the multipupose worker (early l970s).&#13;
Most recently and since the early 70'se the inundation approach has&#13;
gained momentum in India. The commercial vending of the Nirodh(condom)is&#13;
the best e::ample of this approach.&#13;
Currently there is a great emphasis on the clinical approach in an&#13;
integrated basic health service using the multipurpose worker.&#13;
Information and motivation activities have become more diverse and&#13;
more frequently used during the 1970's,  W7ith the advent of the inundation&#13;
approach, mass communication campaigns,including the ezperimental use of satellite&#13;
communication, now discontinued, have 5been nua&amp;&#13;
Two major frustrations have occurred among many difficulties with the&#13;
evolution of the program and service delivery. These are particularly im-&#13;
portant for other programs  :&#13;
1. Because of the sheer size of the task in India, there has been a&#13;
tendency to spend several months or years to start up projects.&#13;
During lengthy start-up periods, little service activity occurs.&#13;
In some cases, frustration at a lack of results has probably con-&#13;
tributed to a premature decision to switch to a new approach before&#13;
the old approach had enough time to take hold.&#13;
2.  Family planning services in some cases have achieved targets by&#13;
sterilizing or otherwise protecting against the risk of conception&#13;
females who are near the end of their reproductive age. The bene-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

fits that accruxe from these persons toward averting births might&#13;
be small for the expended effort.&#13;

2. Payment in kind to the acceptor of sterilization&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
CASE STUDY: INDONESIA&#13;
Policy Initiation and Evolution&#13;
While private efforts were able to nurture family planning activity as&#13;
early as 1952 in Indonesia, this was accomplished in the wake of years of&#13;
accumulated momentum eschewing the concept of birth control including:&#13;
. Religious and moral codes which were perceived by the indigenous&#13;
population to frown upon the use of measures to control family size48&#13;
. Legislation of the 30's and 40's which restricted the use of&#13;
48&#13;
birth control devices&#13;
. The perception that population growth would eventually decline with&#13;
economic development. Until this perception could be realized, it&#13;
was the official policy of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) to re-&#13;
settle Indonesians from foci of crowded areas to outlying islands.&#13;
15,48&#13;
This policy was called transmigration&#13;
Indonesia recognized that it had a population problem as demonstrated&#13;
by its policy of transmigration, but the GOI chose to deal with overpopula-&#13;
tion in a way which it perceived would maintain the status quo until socio-&#13;
economic development could alleviate the problem.&#13;
Although the period between the early 1950's and the mid 1960's pro-&#13;
vided little room for service expansion, the formation of the Institute of&#13;

and the chairman became responsible directly to the President.&#13;
The basic assignment of the NFPCB is to formulate general policy for&#13;
and to coordinate the implementation of the national family planning program&#13;
and complementary population programs at national and regional levels, and&#13;
also to coordinate the implementation of these programs in the field       . The&#13;
NFPCB has a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and four Deputy Chairmen responsible for&#13;
general affairs, family planning, population, and supervision and control. There&#13;
is an NFPCB office in each province, headed by a Provincial Chairman appointed&#13;
by the NFPCB responsible for coordination of activities. He is responsible to&#13;
the Governor, who has the overall responsibility for population and family planning&#13;
activities in the province. The Health Inspectors in the provinces along with the&#13;
provincial NFPCB actually execute the program, since most family planning activity&#13;
takes place in Health Ministry personnel.&#13;
Delivery of Services&#13;
Initially the NFPCB provided services using a clinical approach. All services&#13;
were under the jurisdiction of the physician and available in private and Health Minist y&#13;
facilities as well as Armed Forces facilities. Services were available as in a&#13;
categorical program: not linked to any other services. Services were available for a&#13;
48&#13;
few hours a week&#13;
Although the clinical approach continues to be a major approach of the Indonesian&#13;
Family Planning Program, the outreach and inundation approaches are also in use in&#13;
Indonesia. The outreach approach which began about 1970 was initiated through a program&#13;
whereby Health Ministry personnel would provide family planning services using a village&#13;
48&#13;
head and his wife as a focal point for popularizing contraceptive practice    . During&#13;
the early 1970's nurse midwives and fieldworkers were beginning to realize their&#13;
potential as providers of information, motivation, prescription (of pills, diaphragms,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

primary target the to-be-wed couple. In 2976 population education was brought into&#13;

During the period 1973 to 2978 the first efforts to integrate family&#13;
planning services into the basic health services were attempted7. Ser~sus&#13;

Until 1960 although,conditions seeh!ced Lo favor recognition by the&#13;
Government of Korea (GOK) of the benefits to be 6z-eivsd from a population policy&#13;
which included family planning, no policy was adopted.    War conditions&#13;
during the period 1950 to 1953 may have been an evriy stimulant to the&#13;
cause of family planning as war brought gtger bu-.denrs to the larger fam-&#13;

The GOK has been concerned primarily with prescription and follow-&#13;
up activities. The PPFK, subsidized by the GOK, has assumed the responsi-&#13;
bility for administering all other family planning activities. The GOK&#13;
program is executed through the family Planning sub-section of the MCH&#13;
services. MCH is one of five bureaus in the Ministry of Health and Social&#13;
Affairs (MOHSA). Day-to-day management is coordinated by the chief of the&#13;
family planning sub-section and the MCH bureau chief. The Bureau director&#13;
is apprised of major management decisions. Although these persons are re-&#13;
sponsible for all aspects of policy and operation, they are advised by a&#13;
committee of 15 members: the Family Planning Advisory Committee to the&#13;
Minister. The MOHSA works through nine provincial governments and two&#13;
special city governments all of which have family planning sub-sections&#13;
in their Bureaus of Public Health and Social Affairs. Targets are handed&#13;
down to these regional offices and eventually to field workers as quotas.&#13;
. Delivery of Services&#13;
Early in the program there was a strong predilection to permit only&#13;
physicians to prescribe contraceptives. In conjunction with an extensive&#13;
network of health ministry facilities, a large number of private physicians,&#13;
and the popularity of the IUD during this period (the IUD has always been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81 -&#13;
the most widely used contraceptive method in Korea) D these factora en-&#13;
21&#13;
couraged early entrenchment of the clinical approach       Paramedical&#13;
workers, however, were given legal sanction to provide all family plan-&#13;
ning services to a limited extent soon after the outeet of the progTsm.&#13;
Nonetheless the paramedical workersQ most important activities were&#13;
provision of information and taking ir§.n i   -sotivation activitieo, not&#13;
in prescription activities.&#13;
By the mid 60's a new worker was added to the family planning pro-&#13;
2,57&#13;
gram: the fieldworker D      This worker participated in all program activ°&#13;
ities to some extent,including contraceptive prescription, although he&#13;
could only refer IUD and sterilization acceptors0 As the mid 60's passed&#13;
these workers popularized the outreach approach with their door°zto-door&#13;
and group meetings. The mother's club wEs an important thrust of the fam-&#13;
ily planning program and utilized the fieldmorker.&#13;
Since the early 70's the inundation approach has been used in con-&#13;
nection with all activities. Even street corner information and motivation&#13;
73&#13;
campaigns were initiated recently 0&#13;
At all times throughout the program, authorized private physicians heve&#13;

ANNEX I&#13;
CASE STUDY: PAKISTAN&#13;
Policy Initiation and Evolution&#13;
The first family planning activity to occur in Pakistan began soon&#13;
after Pakistan separated from Britain as a colonialist territory and as-&#13;
sumed dominion status in 1947. Family planning activity grew out of aid&#13;
to refugees from India provided by interested business leaders and wives&#13;
of government officials through the Pakistan Women's Voluntary Service&#13;
and the All Pakistan Women's Association spearheaded by the Prime Minis-&#13;
ter's wife. Both of these groups which had organized family planning&#13;
services in major cities in 1952, merged to form the Family Planning As-&#13;
sociation of Pakistan (FPAP) in 1953 which became the International Plan-&#13;
82&#13;
ned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) affiliate&#13;
Government involvement in family planning activity came early in&#13;
Pakistan and progressed in parallel with some of the following events    :&#13;
. 1955 The Government of Pakistan (GOP) allotted money for support&#13;
of voluntary agencies' activities.&#13;
. 1958 In an effort to secure from the GOP a commitment to provide&#13;
services directly, a series of meetings was held. The out-&#13;
come was a decision by the GOP to continue support of family&#13;
planning, but that services should continue to be provided by&#13;
the FPAP in FPAP facilities. In addition, services were in-&#13;
itiated in armed forces facilities and at railroad hospitals.&#13;
. 1959 In a major speech the Prime Minister addressed problems of&#13;
over-population.&#13;
. 1959 Population Council of New York mission to Pakistan; policy&#13;

Development of Government Family Planning Program Activity&#13;
. Administration28'31'82'91'97&#13;
The administrative structure of the GOP family planning program has&#13;
undergone a series of complex changes over the years. Sources are&#13;
at variance with one another about these changes. At the outset of the pro-&#13;
gram, the provision of services was implemented through the facilities of&#13;
the Ministry of Health (MOH) and administered by a National Family Planning&#13;
Directorate (Board) (NFPB) within the health ministry. However,&#13;
the program was carried out as an integrated one but subsequently became a&#13;
categorical one. Provincial Family Planning Boards were established (at&#13;
least on paper) during the 60's to approve projects and to allocate funds.&#13;
Through the 60's the Federal and Provincial Pakistani Governments provided&#13;
roughly equal funding of the program. Apart from the NFPB and also respon-&#13;
sible for family planning was the Central Family Planning Council (CFPC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
The CFPC too was losely a part of the MOH. This council was composed of&#13;
the Minister of Health and central and provincial secretaries of health&#13;
and finance. In 1968 the status of the CFPC was changed to that of a full&#13;
division within the MOH, and the MOH was renamed the Ministry of Health,&#13;
Labor, and Family Planning (MOHLFP)o Under the 1973 reorganization, an&#13;
unusual arrangement was made whereby the overall adm niatrative reSponsibility of&#13;
the family planning program remained with the Population Planning Division&#13;
in the MOHLFP; however, the execution of the program was placed w^ith the&#13;
Population Planning Council, an autonomous government body of representa-&#13;
tives of various ministries and special interest groups. The federal&#13;
Minister of the Population Planning Division was, however, the chairman&#13;
of the Population Planning Council to ensure continuity at least at the upper&#13;
levels of the program between the MOHLFP and the Population Planning Coun-&#13;
cil. In 1975 the program was made completely autonomous. In each province&#13;
there was a Provincial Population Planning Board to administer the program&#13;
to which funds were directly transferred for project allocation. In high&#13;
density areas, a "continuous motivation system" was established in the&#13;
early 1970's but was abandoned in the mid&amp;7O0s.&#13;
Delivery of Services&#13;
There has always been a fixed-base clinical approach employed in&#13;
the family planning program in Pakistan, but the outreach approach has&#13;
been used since the inception of the program in 1960 and was the main ap-&#13;
proach between 1965 and 1977 for the provision of services. Village le-&#13;
vel workers and the traditional midwife were used as early as 1960 as a&#13;
referral agent  . The concept of trained workers called Lady Tamily Plan-&#13;
ning Visitors and Lady Health Visitors was accepted and employed in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
early 60's. These workers are still used. Included in the concept of using&#13;
these paramedical workers was allowing non-physicians to insert IUD's (orals&#13;
were not used in Pakistan until the 70's). These paramedical workers were&#13;
a necessity since IUD insertion in Pakistan can be performed only by a woman&#13;
and there are few female physicians in the country.&#13;
Subsequent to the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan and during&#13;
the reorganization of the family planning program starting in 1973, there&#13;
was a re-emphasis and expansion of the outreach approach. The vehicle for&#13;
widening the outreach approach was the "continuous motivation system" (CMS).&#13;
This approach called for an army of lay workers to provide family planning&#13;
services. Although the CMS has been abandoned (1976), the workers are&#13;
still paid but are not working. The CMS is described in detail&#13;
15&#13;
elsewhere by Taidi  .   In sum the CMS was to have been an intensification of&#13;
8&#13;
the outreach approach in high density areas utilizing non-physician workers&#13;
15&#13;
Inundation in the commercial sense got off the ground in 1975&#13;
Allegedly, some 35,000 shops (pharmacies, tea stalls, general goods&#13;
stores, etc.) were enlisted to sell pills and condoms. Simultaneously in&#13;
1975, a new program was started which trained high school graduates to in-&#13;
sert IUD's  '   . These workers, Lady Welfare Visitors, participated in&#13;
motivation, information, prescription, and follow-up activities and were&#13;
to be associated with the CMS.&#13;
Prior to 1971 information and motivation activities were carried out&#13;
by fieldworkers as an outreach approach, although mass communication was em-&#13;
9&#13;
ployed . Little information is available about the current information and&#13;
motivation campaigns in Pakistan are virtually non-existent.&#13;

respond to the references listed at the end of the paper.&#13;
Each summary sheet relates pertinent information about each of six&#13;
categories important to governments' role in family planning. These in-&#13;
clude:&#13;
. Development - When the government became active in family planning,&#13;
year of policy and program adoption.&#13;
. Organization - How is the program organized: is it guided by the&#13;
ministry of health or by some autonomous body; is the system of&#13;
delivery predominantly categorical or are family planning ser-&#13;
vices integrated with the health services; what facilities&#13;
are used to deliver services - ministry of health facilities&#13;
or special, non-government facilities or both.&#13;
. Approaches - Which approaches were introduced at what time.&#13;
. Contraceptives - Which contraceptives were most important at&#13;
what time.&#13;
. Personnel and Activities - Date at which certain categories of&#13;
workers were brought into the family planning effort. This cate-&#13;
gory also attempts to summarize the family planning activities&#13;
participated in by these different kinds of workers at the time&#13;
they were brought into the family planning effort. Additionally,&#13;
in the case of all workers except physicians, where these workers&#13;
were allowed to prescribe and supply contraceptives and the type&#13;
of contraceptive prescribed is listed.&#13;
It is important for the reader to note that in preparing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
these summary sheets it was rare for sources used to speci-&#13;
fy the exact year or even time period in which workers began&#13;
to participate in family planning activities in general, but&#13;
most specifically in information and motivation activities.&#13;
Thus, it should be assumed that all paramedical and lay workers&#13;
participate in both of these activities even0 though these are&#13;
not always recorded on the summary sheets.&#13;
0 Inducements - When direct payments were begun as part of the pro-&#13;
gram to acceptors of family planning (incentives), and what&#13;
laws have been enacted which have facilitated the family plan-&#13;
ning program. Where coercion has been a part of the program,&#13;
this is noted.&#13;

@Categories of workers include: physicians, peramedicals, lay workers and&#13;
commercial vendors. Sub-headings under each category, as these appear in the&#13;
tables, are not an exhaustive list of worker types in that country. Lay workers'&#13;
salaries, where salaries are received (most lay workers are volunteers), constitute&#13;
only a nominal portion of the workerse total incowe0&#13;
Paramedical workers may be facility based and/or fieldworkers. Generally&#13;
the name of the worker gives some indication (i.e. LHV is a lady health visitor - a&#13;
fieldworker). Paramedical workers generally have relatively lengthy formal training;&#13;
lay workers have only nominal training for limited duties.&#13;
It should be assumed that all paramedical and lay workers pcrticipate&#13;
in both information and motivation activities even thouSh these are not&#13;
always recorded on the summary sheets0 See discussion of this in opening&#13;
paragraphs of this annex0&#13;
In the "activities" category the "x in the body of the table indicates&#13;
the date or time period during which the opecified worker was first used in the&#13;
family planning program.&#13;

Ft-thermore, the government is trying to raise quality through&#13;
in sei lee training. All junior high teachers spend one month a year&#13;
(July) on taservice training, vwich includes pedagogy, psychology, and&#13;
subject content study. In addition to this month of concentration, there&#13;
are school level, grade level, and subject area meetings of techers&#13;
during the academic year (Leiner 1975, p. 105).&#13;
These problems and proposed solutions indicate that whilt the&#13;
achievements of the Cuban educational afforts have been remarkable,&#13;
particularly in adult education and the rapid expansion of primary and&#13;
secondary school and the extension of schooling into rural areas, such&#13;
education expansion - even in a society as committed to education as&#13;
Cuba - is fraught with difficulty in countries where the availability&#13;
of highly-trained teachilig persounel is limited by the conditions of&#13;
underdevelopment which preceded the Revolution. The shortage of educational&#13;
personnel also reflects the overall shortage of skilled labor in the&#13;
economy, and the shortage of adequate facilities in the schools reflecto&#13;
the overall material goods shortages in the Cuban economy. Furthermore,&#13;
as the figures indicate, one of the principal reasons that there are great&#13;
difficulties in providing schooling in Cuba is the Revolution's counitment&#13;
to rural areas, areas where the population is thinly spread, transportation..&#13;
not particularly well-developed, and a deeply ingrained culture of traditional&#13;
values inherited from the pre-Revolutionary social and economic structure.&#13;
Castro summarized the situation in the following way:&#13;
We face a really special situation in the coming years. Why?&#13;
Because we are living through a transitional situation. We&#13;
still don't have the new man and we no longer have the old one.&#13;
?he nev man doesn't exist yet (Castro 1972).&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this paper is to review
            the evolution of family planning policy and program activity
            in those countries in which there is now an official family
            planning policy as well as some program activity, and to
            discuss the role of family planning programs in promoting
            declining fertility rates. The events leading to adoption by
            governments of family planning policy are discussed. Primary
            emphasis is given to reviewing the role of the private
            sector in family planning which helped initiate and promote
            open discussion of family planning; provided the first,
            limited family planning services; and fostered informational
            exposure of the general population. These activities, it is
            maintained, helped to de-sensitize populations to the
            emotional nature of family planning. Additionally, adoption
            of family planning policy was influenced to an important
            extent by the ability of each country to collect and analyze
            population data as well as to recognize the implications of
            these data for socio-economic development. Public and
            private efforts in this regard are discussed. The
            development of family planning programs in the context of
            institutional developments and delivery systems is traced.
