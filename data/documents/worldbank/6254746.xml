                               TO THE REPUBLICOF MALAWI&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    A. BACKGROUNDANDRECENTDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
The drought-inducedemergency in Malawi&#13;
&#13;
1.     Dryweather inJanuary-February 2005 has ledto a widespread failure o f the agricultural&#13;
harvest in Southern Africa, and created a new emergency situation. Malawi i s one o f the worst&#13;
affected countries and its agricultural production has fallen by 7 percent compared to the&#13;
previous year. The maize crop for 2005 has been hit especially severely and i s estimated to be&#13;
almost 30 percent lower compared to last year, itself a shortage year, resulting inthe worst maize&#13;
season in ten years. The failure o f the maize crop i s o f particular concern for food security as&#13;
maize i s the main staple food in the country. The drop in maize production corresponds to an&#13;
estimated shortfall equivalent to about 20 percent o f national food consumption requirements&#13;
between April 2005 and March 2006 (when the next harvest is expected), which will needto be&#13;
filled by substantial imports of maize, mainly from northern Mozambique and South Africa&#13;
which have experienced good harvests.&#13;
&#13;
2.     The recent Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) analysis has indicated&#13;
that the incomes o f at least 4.2 million people, corresponding to more than 1/3 o f the population,&#13;
have beenseverely reduced as a result o f the harvest failure, particularly in southern Malawi (see&#13;
Map in Attachment 3). These household are unlikely to be able to afford to adequately feed&#13;
themselves and engage in productive economic activity in the next agricultural season, even if&#13;
large quantities o f food were to be imported in the country. The M V A C has estimated that in&#13;
order to maintain regular nutrition levels they will require humanitarian support during the&#13;
period betweenApril 2005 and March 2006 for a total o f 272,000 MT inmaize equivalent terms,&#13;
assuming that food prices do not increase significantly. Most o f this support will be required&#13;
during the period November 2005 to March 2006. In fact most o f the domestically produced&#13;
maize crop will have been consumed by that time, and there will be a need to satisfy the food&#13;
requirementsfor the following few months, untilthe next harvest is ready inMarch-April2006.&#13;
&#13;
3.     In addition to the immediate humanitarian needs, the crisis i s also expected to have a&#13;
severe negative impact on domestic investment and production because the exceptional food&#13;
import requirements will place a severe constraint on the regular imports critical to economic&#13;
production, notably petroleum, fertilizer, machinery, and construction materials. Further, the&#13;
disruptioncausedby the drought to trade and economic activity undermines business confidence,&#13;
and imposes additional losses on the economy as a whole. This situation calls for a quick&#13;
response from the Government and the Bank to help restore physical assets and investment, and&#13;
avoid a collapse inproductive activities duringthe next twelve months.&#13;
&#13;
Economicimpactof the drought-inducedemergency&#13;
&#13;
4.     The drought has severely affected the country's output level and the broader&#13;
macroeconomic scenario for 2005. GDP growth for the year 2005 as a whole has been reduced&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                           2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
by almost 3 percent and is now projectedat 2.1 percent (compared with a pre-drought projection&#13;
of 4.8 percent). Although this reduction i s mainly on account o f the reduction in agricultural&#13;
production, the disaster in agriculture has negatively affected business confidence and the&#13;
outlook for growth throughout the economy, notably for manufacturing which is expected to&#13;
grow half as fast in2005 compared to the previous year.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The economic outlook beyond 2005 will depend on the recovery from the drought-&#13;
induced emergency. The Government has recently agreed a new PRGFprogram with the IMF in&#13;
August 2005.        The implementation o f the macroeconomic framework agreement will entail&#13;
ambitious fiscal adjustments over the next few years, since it is aimed at rapidly reducing the&#13;
domestic debt burden. At the same time, economic prospects have been undermined for 2005&#13;
and subsequent years depending on the availability o f inputs for economic recovery, notably&#13;
agricultural production. Ifthe humanitarian aspects o f the crisis are successfully mitigated and if&#13;
sound domestic macroeconomic and structural policies are maintained, the Malawian economy&#13;
could achieve growth rates of 5-6 percent per year over the next few years. Reaching this level&#13;
of growth will require extemal financing by the donor community in 2005 as well as a recovery&#13;
o f smallholder production and investor confidence that will feed strong manufacturing growth&#13;
from 2005 onwards.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Due to the need for exceptional imports o f maize, the drought-induced emergency is&#13;
expected to place a severe strain on the smooth operation of trade transactions during the&#13;
next few months, thereby threatening economic recovery. Malawi's trade balance i s usually&#13;
strongest during the April to September when the tobacco exports, which account for almost 60&#13;
percent o f Malawi's exports, are concentrated. This period i s also generally associated with a&#13;
stable exchange rate of the Malawi Kwacha vis-a-vis the US dollar and an increase in official&#13;
foreign reserves. On the other hand, the trade balance i s usually under most pressure during&#13;
September to January when most o f the agricultural inputs and food imports take place. The&#13;
drought-induced emergency i s expected to exacerbate this seasonal trade pattem in 2005. It i s&#13;
expected that the trade deficits in 3'd and 4" quarters o f 2005 will be 20 percent higher than a&#13;
year earlier, mainly as a result o f the exceptional level o f food import requirements.                       This&#13;
exceptional level o f imbalance would likely constrain the smooth flow o f imports, thereby&#13;
obstructing economic recovery, notably in agriculture, and endangering the program o f&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization which has been successfully adopted by the authorities since May&#13;
2004.'&#13;
&#13;
7.       The emergency is also putting pressure on fiscal stabilization efforts. The new&#13;
Government since May 2004 inherited a potentially unstable domestic debt level, accumulated as&#13;
a result of the repeated fiscal slippages o f the previous administration. During its first year in&#13;
office the new administration successfully implemented a set o f fiscal measures to stabilize the&#13;
domestic debt level. As a result o f the crisis, however, the Government will now be forced to&#13;
slow down its fiscal stabilization efforts. The Government's budget approved in July 2005 has&#13;
already been expanded to accommodate the additional costs o f the relief operations and ongoing&#13;
food security measures by about 2 percent o f GDP (USD 47 million). The Government has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Infact, contrary to normal seasonal trends, the official exchange rate to the US dollar has depreciated by about 15&#13;
percent between February 2005 and July 2005, partly reflecting the very l o w level o f foreign exchange reserves&#13;
(which remain below 2 months o f imports as o f end-July 2005), and also reflecting the increasing pressure on the&#13;
balance o f payments.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
adopted some initial measures to contain the fiscal impact o f the crisis at 1.3 percent o f GDP and&#13;
minimize the impact on its debt stabilization objectives, but requires additional financing to keep&#13;
its overall deficit within target.  Several donors have already pledged additional support to&#13;
finance a good portion o f the Government's planned humanitarian interventions, although the&#13;
level o f funding and planned level o f intervention i s not yet sufficient to cover the full&#13;
humanitarian needs estimated by the M V A C assessment (see details inparagraphs 9 and 10).&#13;
&#13;
The Response of the Governmentandthe InternationalCommunity&#13;
&#13;
8.      The Government and the development partners have closely coordinated the response to&#13;
the food crisis. The Food Security Joint Task Force (FSJTF), which is chaired by the Principal&#13;
Secretary in the Ministry o f Agriculture, and includes some 50 representatives o f Government&#13;
Ministries, donor agencies, NGOs, and private sector, has been meeting every few weeks since&#13;
the onset o f the crisis inMarch 2005, to discuss the situation and agree on a strategy to respond&#13;
to the emergency. The World Bank i s a member o f this task force and has actively participated&#13;
inthe discussions. Inadditionthe World Bank is also amember ofthemore restrictedTechnical&#13;
Secretariat o f the FSJTF, which has assisted in preparing the plenary session meetings o f the&#13;
FSJTF.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Giventhe enormity of the problem, the Government is planning to focus relief efforts on&#13;
the most severely affected 2 million people (those people with food deficits o f 25 percent or&#13;
more), for a total food requirement o f 200,000 MT. Specifically, the Government and the&#13;
development partners have jointly discussed and agreed on a set o f interventions to respond to&#13;
the food emergency, which entail three levels o f intervention: (i)     provide targeted free food&#13;
distribution; (ii)scale up existing safety nets through expanded public works programs; and (iii)&#13;
import and sell maize domestically on commercial terms to ensure adequate supplies in the&#13;
domestic market. The emergency interventions highlighted above entail procuring 200,000 MT&#13;
of maize equivalent through public sector imports, to be distributed through targeted food&#13;
distribution and sales on commercial terms.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Several development partners have pledged financial support to the Government to&#13;
respond to the humanitarian crisis. Notably the Department for International Development&#13;
(DFID) and the European Union (EU) have pledged USD20 million (USDlOSm from the EU&#13;
and USD9.5m from DFID) for purchase and distribution o f food, additional to their existing&#13;
commitments o f USD7.2 million (USD4m from DFID andUSD3.2m from the EU) to restock the&#13;
Strategic Grain Reserve.     The EU has also pledged an additional USDlO million towards&#13;
expanded public works program. Further, the EUmay be able to provide a further USD5 million&#13;
for relief operations by reallocating resources under one o f its projects. Additional contributions&#13;
towards the cost o f humanitarian interventions are likely to be provided by Norway for USD2&#13;
million, Japan for USD2 million, France for U S D l million, and Ireland for USD0.6 million.&#13;
Finally, USAIDhas signaled that it may be able to provide in-kindmaize contributions o f around&#13;
40,000 M T (worth about USD10).&#13;

                        B. WORLD BANKRESPONSETO THE CRISIS&#13;
&#13;
IDA's SupportStrategy&#13;
&#13;
11.    IDA's response to the drought-induced crisis in Malawi is closely coordinated with the&#13;
IMF, and the other development partnersactive inMalawi. Within this coordinated framework,&#13;
IDA is following amulti-pronged strategy to help Malawi to cope with this crisis. It consists of:&#13;
&#13;
       (a)    Reallocation o f uncommitted funds under the Third Malawi Social Action Fund&#13;
              project (MASAF I11- P075911) to redirect project activities to scale-up social&#13;
              protection systems in the areas most affected by the drought. IDA staff are&#13;
              working with counterpart Government agencies and other development partners&#13;
              to consider how existing IDA operations might provide for the urgent social and&#13;
              infrastructure needs arising from the current crisis. The IDA team has proposedto&#13;
              the Department o f Poverty andDisaster Management, Office o f the President and&#13;
              Cabinet, that some proceeds from MASAF I11activities where disbursement is&#13;
              expected to slow down as a result of the drought-induced emergency be&#13;
              reallocated within the MASAF I11Project for the quick scaling up o f safety nets&#13;
              and reliefintervention.&#13;
&#13;
       (b)    Immediate assistance through financing o f critical imports provided under the&#13;
              proposed Emergency Recovery Project. An emergency recovery operation i s&#13;
              considered appropriate in the case o f Malawi, because the emergency has&#13;
              seriously dislocatedMalawi's economy and calls for a quick response.&#13;
&#13;
       (c)    Assisting the Government in tackling the underlying structural problems which&#13;
              lead to food insecurity through technical assistance and investment operations.&#13;
              The Bank i s already providing key technical assistance related to weather risk&#13;
              prevention and mitigation measures. Inparticular, following a feasibility study in&#13;
              2004, the Bank is currently working with the Government and private sector to&#13;
              pilot weather based insurance contracts for smallholders to manage weather risk&#13;
              through insurance markets, starting with the next agricultural season in October&#13;
              2005. The Bank i s also providing technical assistance to the Government o f&#13;
              Malawi on the practical issues involved with using SAFEX options to hedge grain&#13;
              price risks in Malawi.     Further, an irrigation investment operation including&#13;
              drought proofing technologies (through precision farming and improved crop&#13;
              management) i s in the advanced stages o f preparation, and Board presentation i s&#13;
              expected in late 2005.&#13;
&#13;
      (d)     Ongoing policy dialogue to strengthen food security and agricultural markets. As&#13;
              part o f the Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth Program (FIMAG -&#13;
              P072395) structural adjustment credit, the Government is undertaking a set o f&#13;
              important policy reforms affecting food security and the efficient operation o f&#13;
              agricultural markets. FIMAG supports the Government in addressing medium-&#13;
              term reforms, which are progressing according to a well-defined timetable. This&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                timetable could not usefully be accelerated in an attempt to gain access to FIMAG&#13;
                funds inthe next few months.&#13;
&#13;
Rationalefor IDA Involvement.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Malawi urgently needs additional external financing to facilitate economic recovery and&#13;
provide support to investment and production, notably agricultural production, and to return&#13;
growth to levels consistent with the government macroeconomic program. In the absence o f&#13;
additional resources, the additional need for foreign exchange resulting from the exceptional&#13;
food imports requirements during 2005/06 would likely exacerbate the negative effects o f the&#13;
drought on the economy, restrict critical imports, and limit progress towards macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization during 2005/06. Further,unless adequate funding i s secured the fiscal impact o f the&#13;
crisis could reverse progress towards economic recovery, notably the reduction o f the domestic&#13;
debt which the Government has achieved during 2004/05. This operation i s a key component o f&#13;
the Bank's support to Malawi to mitigate the impact o f the drought crisis and allow a speedy&#13;
recovery to a poverty-reducingmedium term growth path.&#13;
&#13;
13.     IDA'Sresponse is consistent with its Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi.&#13;
The CAS recognizes that Malawi is highly vulnerable to climatic shocks that adversely affect&#13;
agricultural production and economic growth. The CAS anticipates that when such events occur,&#13;
resources that should have been used for development may need to be reallocated to relief or&#13;
emergency activities. In anticipation o f these eventualities, the Bank has been working with the&#13;
Government and other donors to diversify Malawi's agricultural exports and to develop a more&#13;
robust food security strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Rationalefor EmergencyAssistance&#13;
&#13;
14.     Malawi urgently needs additional external financing to provide support for recovery in&#13;
key activities o f the economy which could falter and cause additional social hardship and to&#13;
maintain macroeconomic stability. This operation i s a key component o f the Bank's support&#13;
strategy for the country. A request for emergency assistance was received fiom the Government&#13;
on June 1 2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  C. THE PROPOSEDEMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
15,     The Malawi Emergency Recovery Project is aimed at supporting the restoration of assets&#13;
and production following the drought-induced emergency in early 2005, and thereby supporting&#13;
the growth path central to the macroeconomic program adopted by the new administration since&#13;
May 2004. Specifically, this emergency grant will provide an additional USD30million to allow&#13;
critical private sector imports for the restoration o f assets, investment and production to take&#13;
place with the least disruption to the economy. The domestic financial resources generated by&#13;
the grant will go towards financing the approved Government's budget, including expanded&#13;
safety nets and other costs o f responding to the drought, and will allow Government to reduce&#13;
domestic debt levels and maintain spending levels in line with the targets o f the IMF PRGF&#13;
program which has recently been approved.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
16.      The grant will provide immediate support to finance a positive list o f imports identified&#13;
as necessary to an effective recovery program while supporting macroeconomic objectives by&#13;
providing financing for the approved budget. The project will provide assistance for a broad&#13;
range o f imports by the private sector, especially imported production inputs and imported&#13;
capital equipment, through the use o f a positive list. The proposed grant would finance 100&#13;
percent o f the delivered cost o f eligible imports on the positive list, excluding import duties and&#13;
taxes. The nature o f the positive list i s such that no Bank safeguards policies are triggered. No&#13;
disbursements will be made to cover used or luxury goods, military equipment, or nuclear&#13;
reactors. While this type o f operation does not include conditionality linked to macroeconomic&#13;
policies, IDMBank monitoring o f economic developments and close collaboration with the IMF&#13;
(under the PRGFprogram) will help ensure adequate macroeconomic and fiscal diligence on the&#13;
part o f the Government. To accommodate the emergency nature o f the operation, abbreviated&#13;
processingwill be used as provided under OP 8.50.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The IDA Grant is proposed to be SDR20.8 million (USD30 million equivalent), based on&#13;
an assessment of the country's requirements after considering other sources o f financing.&#13;
&#13;
18.      The proposed grant i s being submitted to the Executive Directors for approval subject to&#13;
the availability o fadequate donor resources for the purpose o fenablingthe Association to extend&#13;
grants as described in Section I1o f the Memorandum to the Executive Directors on Transition&#13;
from IDA13 to IDA14 approved on March 10, 2005. The IDA Financing Agreement will only&#13;
be signed after Management has determined that such resources are available for the making o f&#13;
this Grant and notified the Recipient accordingly. Prior to signing, Management will satisfy&#13;
itself that the Recipient remains eligible to receive the Grant, and that no change has occurred in&#13;
the situation o f the Recipient which would significantly and adversely affect the basis on which&#13;
the approval by the Executive Directors o f the Grant was made. At this time, Management has&#13;
determined that adequate donor resources have been made available for the purpose o f making&#13;
this Grant andhas determinedthat it canproceedto signing.&#13;
&#13;
Benefitsand Risks&#13;
&#13;
19.      Project Benefits. The import financing under the proposed grant will provide timely&#13;
supply o f essential equipment, materials and commodities which will be critical in assisting the&#13;
recovery o f investment and production for key economic sectors, notably agriculture.             The&#13;
counterpart finds generated by the sale o f foreign exchange will provide the Government with an&#13;
important source o f financing to support the budget approved by Parliament (that has already&#13;
been scaled-up to respond to the emergency). The grant will not be used to increase spending&#13;
beyond the approved levels. Overall, the grant will complement the support for short- and&#13;
medium-termrecovery that will beprovidedby other multilateral andbilateral agencies.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Project Risks. The major risk o f the operation is that the impact of the crisis may be&#13;
larger than currently anticipated with additional implications on the balance o f payments and on&#13;
economic growth, and that the fiscal deficit will not be controlled because o f the need for&#13;
additional relief interventions. If this risk were to materialize, the Bank would work with the&#13;
intemational donor community so that necessary additional resources could become available to&#13;
the country, and the Bank would propose further support to economic growth through a follow-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
on DPL operation. A further risk is that the next agricultural season may also be affected by&#13;
adverse weather conditions that will undermine economic recovery. If adverse weather were to&#13;
persist for a second year in a row, actions would be taken by the intemational community to&#13;
provide support for relief and economic recovery and prevent a further collapse inthe economic&#13;
capacity o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
     D. INSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSAND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
ProjectOrganizationandManagement&#13;
&#13;
21.      The project will be implemented by the Ministry o f Finance in close collaboration with&#13;
the Reserve Bank o f Malawi since it will largely support import financing requirements. Both&#13;
institutions have prior experience in coordination o f disbursements against imports, and this&#13;
would ensure compliance with agreed procurement as well as disbursement arrangements.&#13;
Consistent with the emergency nature of the proposed support, these arrangements have been&#13;
simplified and streamlined to the extent feasible, while seeking to ensure that overall concems&#13;
about due diligence, transparency, and avoiding corruption are addressed.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The project will be implemented over a twelve-month period but most disbursement&#13;
should be completed in the first six months after effectiveness. The Closing Date for this grant&#13;
will be December 31,2006.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
23.      Consistent with the emergency nature o f this recovery assistance, implementation&#13;
arrangements have been simplified.       To ensure due diligence and sound governance, the&#13;
arrangements would seek to ensure that:&#13;
&#13;
            a) Grant proceeds are used only to finance imports o f items contained in the list o f&#13;
                imports permissible under the Grant (Attachment 1);&#13;
&#13;
           b) proper procedures on procurement and accounting and the complete&#13;
                documentation o ftransactions; and&#13;
&#13;
           c) provision ofmanagement information usingsuitable monitoring and audit tools.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The Ministry o f Finance and the Reserve Bank o f Malawi have agreed the following&#13;
implementation arrangements, defining the assistance to be provided by each entity. The&#13;
Ministry o f Finance will be the representative o f the Government for all the purposes o f the&#13;
Financing Agreement (FA). The Ministry o fFinance will therefore agree to:&#13;
&#13;
           a) authorize the Reserve Bank o f Malawi to administer and execute the Project;&#13;
&#13;
           b) comply with all the contractual obligations ofthe FA;&#13;
&#13;
           c) undertake the necessary actions to ensure that the quarterly financial management&#13;
               and the quarterly progress reports are submitted by the Reserve Bank o f Malawi&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                          8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   and copied to the Ministryo f Finance within 15 days after the end o f the calendar&#13;
                   quarter; and&#13;
&#13;
               d) request the National Audit Office to carry out the Project final audit, or to appoint&#13;
                   independent private auditors for this task, and submit the audit to IDA no later&#13;
                   than six months after the closing date o f the Project.&#13;
&#13;
The Reserve Bank o f Malawi will:&#13;
&#13;
                   manage and operate the project's Deposit Account; for this purpose the Reserve&#13;
                   Bankwill assign responsibilityofProject Manager to the Director, Department o f&#13;
                   International Operations, who will manage and administer the project;&#13;
&#13;
                   using appropriate financial management systems, and provide accountable and&#13;
                   timely financial information on project financing and expenditures; prepare&#13;
                   disbursement requests under the project and the records for the Statement o f&#13;
                   Expenditures;&#13;
&#13;
                   sign and submit the disbursement requests under the project;2&#13;
&#13;
                   establish and maintain appropriate records reflecting the transactions financed&#13;
                   under the project, including all the documentation in connection with eligible&#13;
                   imports and allow access to such information to the NAO auditors and&#13;
                   representatives o f IDA whenever required;&#13;
&#13;
                   prepare and submit quarterly financial management reports in a format agreed&#13;
                   with IDA and copy to the Ministry o f Finance by the fifteenth day o f the&#13;
                   following calendar month;&#13;
&#13;
                   prepare and submit quarterly progress reports in a format agreed with IDA and&#13;
                   copy to the Ministry o f Finance by the fifteenth day o f the following calendar&#13;
                   month;&#13;
&#13;
                   facilitate the auditors' activities.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of Malawi will jointly prepare and&#13;
submit to IDAthe Implementation CompletionReport for the project no later than 4 months after&#13;
the closing date o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 For this purpose, in order to accelerate the preparation and processing o f the disbursement requests, the Recipient&#13;
will establish a "Verification Team" to carry out the joint (Recipient and Bank) verification of the information inthe&#13;
summary statement of'expenditure (e.g. such that the itendgoods are on the agreed positive list, that the prices paid&#13;
were competitive and reasonable, and that all the required documentation is included). The IDA procurement&#13;
specialist, financial management specialists from the Country Office, and the disbursement officer fromthe regional&#13;
processing center, will be part o f the verification team. The statement of expenditures will be endorsed by the&#13;
Verification Team prior to submission to IDA.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
25.      The proceeds o f the Grant will be made available to finance eligible private sector&#13;
imports against documentation evidencing that the imported goods meet the eligibility&#13;
requirements o f paragraphs 1.6 - 1.8 o f the Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits May 2004 (The Procurement Guidelines); and are both on the positive list o f&#13;
imports listed in Attachment 1 and procured following the agreed procurement procedures&#13;
described below. Second hand goods and equipment will not be eligible for funding under the&#13;
Grant.    The Grant will provide for some advance contracting and retroactive financing as&#13;
described inparagraph32 below.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The last Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for Malawi i s dated M a y&#13;
2004. The country i s in a process o f procurement reforms which will be supported by several&#13;
donors and by IDA under the restructured Financial Management, Transparency and&#13;
Accountability Project (FIMTAP - P078408). Public procurement i s guided by the Public&#13;
Procurement Act (No. 8 o f 2003). The Act i s assessed as a good UNCITRAL based procurement&#13;
law. Procurement regulations to be used with the Procurement Act, desk manuals and standard&#13;
bidding and contract documents have been prepared and distributed to the public procurement&#13;
entities. The core o f the procurement reform activities are capacity building; study and design of&#13;
a procurement management information system as well as the establishment o f country&#13;
procurement systems assessment tools.&#13;
&#13;
27.     The Reserve Bank o f Malawi, which in collaboration with the Ministryo f Finance i s the&#13;
executing agency for the proposed Project, will be responsible for keeping the records o f the&#13;
import transactions financed under the grant, and also to verify that the transactions satisfy the&#13;
agreed procurement procedures. The Reserve Bank and the Ministry o f Finance have prior&#13;
experience in coordination o f disbursements against imports and are familiar with the Bank's&#13;
procurement policies and procedures, as well as the requirements for procurement records&#13;
management, procurement monitoring and reporting, and are therefore capable o f ensuring&#13;
compliance with the agreed procurement arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Only imports from private sector contracts will be financed under the Grant. The&#13;
prevalent method o f procurement in the private sector is based on long term relationships with&#13;
known suppliers and to some extent market surveys. All procurement o f imports by the private&#13;
sector under the project will be based on the established private sector or commercial practices&#13;
and will not needIDA prior review, since the private sector i s profit oriented and procurement i s&#13;
based on value-for-money considerations. In addition, in order to safeguard Malawi's national&#13;
financial interests, imports, excluding those expressly exempted, are subject by law to Pre-&#13;
shipment Inspection (PSI) for quality, quantity and reasonableness o f price by a professional PSI&#13;
firm, In order to avoid excessive transaction costs for IDA and the government, private sector&#13;
import contracts of less than USD10,OOO will not be eligible for disbursement o f grant proceeds.&#13;
&#13;
 29.    Overall the procurement risk rating for the project is assessed as "Average".   The Grant&#13;
would be used to finance only imports procured in accordance with the procedures presented in&#13;
Table 1below.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
30.      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was carried out in 2001&#13;
covering both the public as well as private sectors. The overall conclusion then was that, when&#13;
compared to most developing countries, Malawi had a good legal and institutional framework for&#13;
public sector financial management and accountability. Nonetheless, weaknesses were identified&#13;
inbudget execution inensuringthat the allocated resources were utilized efficiently for intended&#13;
purposes and in obtaining comfort that value for money was being achieved. A number of&#13;
initiatives have been undertaken by the Government o f Malawi, with the support o f the&#13;
international community including the Bank, to strengthen the country's financial accountability&#13;
framework.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursementand FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
31,      Adequate funding and the timely and uninterruptedflow o f resources will be needed to&#13;
expedite implementation o f the project. The project will therefore use a quick disbursement&#13;
mechanism that uses eligible expenditures from a positive list o f imports to generate counterpart&#13;
funds. The proceeds o f the grant will be disbursed against 100percent o f the delivered cost of&#13;
imports subject to the agreed positive list. Payments against the positive list o f eligible imports&#13;
will be deposited in a Government U S Dollar Deposit Account established specifically for this&#13;
project through the Reserve Bank o f Malawi. Disbursements into the Deposit Account will be&#13;
made against Statements o f Expenditures listing eligible imports, for which supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained by the Reserve Bank o f Malawi. Verification o f the information&#13;
given on the Statements o f Expenditure will be carried out jointly by Government and Bank&#13;
officials to establish that the goods were actually received, and the prices paid were competitive&#13;
and reasonable. The local currency funds generated from the foreign exchange sales will be&#13;
deposited in the M G 1 account at the RBM and will go towards financing the Government&#13;
budget3 The grant will not be used to increase spending beyond the approved levels, and will&#13;
therefore contribute to domestic debt reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Any withdrawal of foreign currency out o fthe deposit account will have to be matchedby an equivalent deposit in&#13;
local currency into the MGl account.&#13;

RetroactiveFinancing&#13;
&#13;
32.     The drought-induced emergency inMalawi i s expected to place severe strain on the trade&#13;
current account and the smooth operation o f trade transactions during the next few months, As&#13;
mentioned above, Malawi's trade balance is usually under most pressure during September to&#13;
January when most o f the agricultural inputs and food imports take place. The emergency i s&#13;
expected to exacerbate this seasonal trade pattern in2005. It i s expected that trade deficits in3rd&#13;
and 4th quarters o f 2005 will be 20 percent higher than a year earlier, mainly as a result o f the&#13;
exceptional level o f food import requirements. This will place an unusually severe strain on the&#13;
current account duringthe next few months, constraining the smooth flow o f imports and thereby&#13;
obstructing economic recovery. Inorder to facilitate critical fertilizer and other imports prior to&#13;
the start of the agricultural season in fall 2005, the proposed grant would include retroactive&#13;
financing in the amount o f SDR6.3 million (USD9 million equivalent), correspondent to 30&#13;
percent of the grant amount, which would be provided to finance expenditures incurred up to six&#13;
months before grant signing, and inany case not earlier than April 1,2005.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
33.     The project will only have a limitednumber o f financial transactions, and the emphasis&#13;
will be on making sure that the flow o f hnds from the IDA Grant Account through the Deposit&#13;
Account at the Reserve Bank o f Malawi to the Government o f Malawi is satisfactory, and that&#13;
there are arrangements to record transactions documents, relating to the underlying import&#13;
documents to be used to support Bank disbursementsunder the grant. The documentation used&#13;
to support Bank disbursements will include the name of supplier, customs declaration number,&#13;
value, description o f goods, the name o f importer, date o f payment, amount paidrate o f&#13;
exchange. Inaddition, supporting documents for payments will include evidence o f shipment o f&#13;
goods and commodities purchased (such as copy of the Malawi Customs Declaration Form 12,&#13;
which i s issued by customs upon examination o f the Bill o f Lading and other customs&#13;
documentation), proof o f payment or certification that payment was made (such as the&#13;
Application to Purchase Foreign Currency Form E appropriately endorsed by a commercial bank&#13;
as evidence o f payment), and other relevant custom documentation (which may include a Clean&#13;
Report o f Findings (CRF) fkom Pre-shipment Inspection (PSI) Agency or affiliate in exporting&#13;
country).&#13;
&#13;
34.    The Reserve Bank o f Malawi will record and maintain details o f all transactions used to&#13;
claim reimbursement under the project as per agreed positive list.                Given the short&#13;
implementation period o f approximately twelve months, quarterly financial monitoring reports&#13;
will be submittedto the Bank within one month after the end o f each calendar quarter showing:&#13;
       Progress report;&#13;

       Uses o f funds by project-activityin accordance with the "positive list"; and,&#13;

&#13;
35.     The Reserve Bank o fMalawi has inplace adequate accounting and financial management&#13;
reporting systems.      Separate project accounts prepared in accordance with International&#13;
Accounting Standards will be maintained. It has been agreed that all claims under the project as&#13;
per agreed 'positive list' will be recorded and maintained. The Reserve Bank o f Malawi and the&#13;
Ministry o f Finance have qualified staff experienced inmanaging World Bank projects. National&#13;
standards are in compliance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International&#13;
Standards on Auditing (ISA).&#13;
&#13;

36.     Only one set o f project financial statements covering the entire project period will be&#13;
prepared in the same format as for quarterly reports, and will be submitted to the Bank together&#13;
with the auditors report no later than six months after the last disbursement date. The Ministryo f&#13;
Finance will arrange for a financial audit upon completion o f the project. The terms o f reference&#13;
for the audit, to be submittedto the Bank for approval, will include the following tasks:&#13;
&#13;
        0  Assessing the adequacy and reliability o f procedures used for preparing import&#13;

ResultsFrameworkandMonitoringIndicators&#13;
&#13;
37.     The performance o f the Project will be evaluated on the basis o f the results framework&#13;
specified inAttachment 2. The framework focuses on the project development objective (PDO),&#13;
as specified in paragraph 15 above, and the intermediate outcomes expected. This information&#13;
will be usedto track progress towards the PDO and to make changes inthe project if necessary&#13;
duringimplementation. It should be noted that negative performance inthe PDO indicator may&#13;
reflect other factors that are responsible for the lack o f rapid economic recovery (as the project is&#13;
only a small part o f the wider interventions to facilitate the economic recovery). If the project&#13;
intermediate outcome indicators suggest that project performance i s satisfactory, but project&#13;
outcome indicators indicate that the economy continues to be under distress this may indicate&#13;
that the impact o f the crisis i s proving to be larger than anticipated, and that there may be needto&#13;
review the overall intervention strategy and the required levels o f support.&#13;

            The Emergency Recovery Grant Project
            will support the restoration of assets and production,
            following the drought-induced emergency in early 2005,
            through the financing of private sector imports necessary to
            an effective recovery program. The main objective will be to
            finance imports, critical to the recovery of investment and
            production; counterpart funds will be transferred to the
            approved budget, and thereby contribute to the financing of
            the Government's poverty reduction strategy. However,
            among the major risks is the impact of the crisis, which may
            be larger than anticipated, placing continued pressure on
            imports, such that investment, production, and exports may
            fail to recover quickly; that the next agricultural season
            may also be affected by adverse weather conditions which may
            undermine an economic recovery.
