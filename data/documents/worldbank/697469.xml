RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         The Russian Federation&#13;
Beneficiaries:    Volgograd Gorgas, Local District Heating and Power Utilities.&#13;
Amount:           US$106.5 million&#13;
Terms:            Currency Pool Loan for 17 years, including 5 years grace, at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable interest rate.&#13;
Onlending:        The proceeds of the loan directed toward gas distribution rehabilitation would be&#13;
onlent to Volgograd Gorgas with an amortization period of 17 years, including 5&#13;
years grace. The energy efficiency component would be onlent to municipal district&#13;
heating and power utilities with an amortization of 10 years, including 3 years&#13;
grace. Funds onlent would carry an interest rate equal to the Bank lending rate plus&#13;
a premium of 250 basis points.&#13;
Objectives:       The principal objectives of the project are to increase the efficiency of energy use&#13;
in Russia, to improve the efficiency and safety of gas distribution, and to support&#13;
policy reforms in the gas subsector. The project is expected to have both direct&#13;
impact in the targeted cities and indirect impact elsewhere in Russia through the&#13;
demonstration of technological and managerial principles.&#13;
Description:      The project consists of three components: (a) gas distribution  network&#13;
improvements; (b) energy efficiency investments; and (c) technical assistance. The&#13;
gas distribution network investments largely focus on metering, cathodic protection,&#13;
and pipe replacement. Energy efficiency investments would focus on replacement&#13;
of outdated and inefficient equipment. Technical assistance is designed both to&#13;
support project implementation and to advance the government's reform program.&#13;
An initial program aimed at greenhouse gas reduction, and financed under the&#13;
Global Environment Facility, is also linked to the project.&#13;
Benefits:         Direct project benefits arising through metering and through support of energy&#13;
efficiency investments include opportunities to: (a) increase availability of low-cost&#13;
gas for export; (b) defer investment in new gas supply; and/or, (c) displace&#13;
petroleum products or coal in domestic markets, with resultant benefits in terms of&#13;
environmental impacts and energy export opportunities. The investments in gas&#13;
distribution rehabilitation would yield benefits in terms of increased economic life&#13;
for network assets, as well as reduced investment costs through improved control&#13;
and planning. The acquisition of leak detection equipment would also help to&#13;
improve safety and reduce leakage of methane into the atmosphere.&#13;
Risks:            While it is expected that all project components would generate strong economic&#13;
returns and acceptable financial returns, risks are not inconsiderable. Risks faced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- v -&#13;
by the project include those associated with equipment prices, gas price reform,&#13;
macroeconomic uncertainties, changes to taxes, and efficiency of implementation.&#13;
The risks are being addressed explicitly through up-front actions and conditions, a&#13;
mid-term implementation review, consulting assistance, and a twinning arrangement&#13;
with a foreign gas distribution company.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
I. THE MACROECONOMIC SETTING&#13;
1.1   Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union (FSU) in late 1991, the Russian government&#13;
launched a radical program of economic reform to replace the remnants of the command economy with&#13;
a market-oriented economy based on the private ownership of property. From the beginning, this effort&#13;
took place in decidedly unfavorable conditions and, while results have been mixed, there have been&#13;
significant achievements in a number of specific sectors.&#13;
1.2    A great deal was accomplished during the period 1992 - 1993 to move Russia toward a market&#13;
economy. Prices have been liberalized, and there have been major shifts in relative prices, especially for&#13;
the critical energy and service sectors. Privatization has led to a rapid transfer of state assets into private&#13;
hands. Foreign trade has been substantially liberalized. Finally, enterprises are making decisions&#13;
increasingly on the basis of commercial criteria. Macroeconomic problems have persisted, but can be&#13;
largely traced to structural distortions that were inherited from the past. These distortions are being&#13;
addressed and progress is being made in rectifying them, but full adjustment must be regarded as a long-&#13;
term process. In the near term, various political factions are likely to express, and occasionally impose,&#13;
alternative paths for development. However, it is expected that Russia will continue to move toward a&#13;
market economy, both as a result of existing momentum, and for lack of a feasible alternative.&#13;
1.3    Within this evolving pattern of development, key sectors will have a direct positive impact at the&#13;
macroeconomic and microeconomic level. Energy is one such sector, and within energy, the gas&#13;
subsector is critical.  Gas is the primary source of fuel in the domestic market, and in 1993 accounted&#13;
for approximately 20 percent of foreign exchange earnings. The proposed Gas Distribution Rehabilitation&#13;
and Energy Efficiency Project, the subject of this report, is consistent with the goals of sector and&#13;
macroeconomic reform and recovery. The project would demonstrate the potential for short-term supply&#13;
enhancements by improving the efficiency of gas utilization, while supporting Russia's sector-reform&#13;
programs in the areas of price, structure, commercialization at the enterprise level, and reduced adverse&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
II. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
2.1    Energy is estimated to account for 15 percent of Russia's GDP, 11 percent of industrial&#13;
production, and 50 percent of its convertible foreign exchange earnings. Rapid stabilization of the overall&#13;
economy is unlikely to occur unless macroeconomic reforms are paralleled by energy- sector reform and&#13;
recovery.&#13;
A.    Energy Resources, Production and Exports&#13;
2.2   It is estimated that Russia has 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, 33 percent of natural gas&#13;
reserves, 10 percent of hard coal reserves, and 20 percent of the world's brown coal reserves. Its&#13;
capacity to generate electric power ranks second in the world. Russia is the second largest energy&#13;
producer in the world, accounting for about 14 percent of total commercial energy production. Despite&#13;

having one of the world's most energy intensive economies, Russia has been able to export over 25&#13;
percent of its total production, making it the largest exporter of energy. Energy exports, primarily of&#13;
oil and gas, represent almost 50 percent of Russia's current exports to non-Commonwealth of Independent&#13;
States (CIS) countries, thus providing critical foreign exchange.&#13;
2.3    Maintaining productive capacity and developing unexploited energy reserves will require massive&#13;
investments. Annual capital requirements for oil and gas alone, merely to stabilize existing production&#13;
levels, are probably in the excess of US$10 billion.  Funds are no longer available to meet these&#13;
requirements, however; and the future prospects for the sector are grim. Output of energy is now falling&#13;
in all energy subsectors. Crude oil output is down more than 45 percent from its 1988 peak and has been&#13;
declining at an annual rate of about 15 percent for the past three years. This decline must be viewed as&#13;
catastrophic if sustained for another year or two. Natural gas production, which had steadily increased&#13;
over the past several years, declined by over 3 percent 1993, and is estimated to have fallen by a similar&#13;
percentage in 1994. Production of coal has also been declining by approximately 10 percent each year,&#13;
indicating a deepening crisis in this subsector as well. Finally, Russia's electricity-generating capacity&#13;
has only been adequate owing to a drop in consumption of about 6 percent per year. Without this&#13;
contraction in demand, the poorly maintained power plants and ageing asset base would be inadequate.&#13;
Data on Russia's energy production and net exports for the years 1990 to 1993 are contained in Annex&#13;
2-1.&#13;
2.4    Energy exports in 1993 consisted of: natural gas, estimated at 51 percent; oil and petroleum&#13;
products, 42 percent; coal, 5 percent; and electricity, 2 percent (based on tons of oil equivalence).&#13;
Natural gas is expected to become increasingly important, in both export and domestic markets, because&#13;
of its environmental attractiveness. As a result, the strategic value of gas to the Russian economy&#13;
requires special attention.&#13;
B.    Energy Consumption&#13;
2.5    Data on consumption of commercial energy in Russia for 1990 through 1993 are presented, by&#13;
type, in Annex 2-1. Energy consumption decreased by 12 percent between 1990 and 1993, from 1,121&#13;
million tons of oil equivalent (mtoe) to 984 mtoe. The largest declines were in the coal sector (23&#13;
percent) and petroleum products (32 percent). Gas consumption remained relatively constant during this&#13;
period (as interfuel substitution has taken place in the interim). In 1993, gas accounted for about 55&#13;
percent of domestic consumption', petroleum about 18 percent and coal 17 percent. The remaining 10&#13;
percent was largely primary electricity supply (nuclear and hydroelectric power). While gas volumes&#13;
were down in 1993 relative to 1990, the share was 6 percentage points higher. The prospects for&#13;
continued increases in market share for natural gas are good because of its relative price advantages and&#13;
favorable environmental impacts.&#13;
2.6   Inefficient energy use is prevalent throughout the Russian economy. In 1992, Russia's energy&#13;
use per unit of GDP was 14 times that of Japan, 8 times that of the United Kingdom, and 5 times that&#13;
of the United States. This problem has since worsened, with considerable decreases in economic output&#13;
and only modest decreases in energy consumption. Russia's inefficient energy use stems from a&#13;
combination of factors, including an emphasis on energy-intensive industries, widespread use of inefficient&#13;
and outdated equipment, prices that discourage efficient use of energy, and an absence of metering.&#13;
I /   Includes gas used in thermal power generation and in petrochemical production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.7    The potential for the economic rationalization of energy consumption in Russia is substantial.&#13;
The government has initiated a program of reforms to address this prospect encompassing: (a) energy&#13;
price adjustments, through liberalization of pricing mechanisms, reduction in subsidies and reduction in&#13;
export constraints; (b) preparation of draft legislation on energy conservation; and, (c) establishment of&#13;
the Russian Energy Savings Foundation (RESF) to encourage energy efficiency investments.&#13;
C.    Energy Prices, Taxes, and Subsidies&#13;
2.8    Significant adjustments have been made to relative energy prices over the past three to four years.&#13;
In 1991 energy prices were less than 10 percent of estimated market levels. By early 1995, domestic gas&#13;
prices to industrial and commercial customers had reached approximately two-thirds of estimated full cost&#13;
recovery, and domestic prices for petroleum products were at similar levels. Electricity prices varied&#13;
among regions, but were typically around 60 percent of full cost recovery on sales to industry. Energy&#13;
prices to households, however, have risen at a more gradual rate. The government has justified the&#13;
slower increase in household prices in light of the slow adjustment in labor prices, the absence of an&#13;
effective safety net and the resultant concerns over household ability-to-pay for energy. Given that the&#13;
poor typically spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy, this approach is acceptable until&#13;
an adequate safety net is established.&#13;
2.9    Taxation of oil production has been prohibitive. This policy has resulted in financial losses by&#13;
producing enterprises, and sharply curtailed investment. Petroleum tax rates are very high, and, since&#13;
they are based on revenues rather than profits, are insensitive to the variations in production and&#13;
operating costs across the sector. Financial support has been extended to the sectcr through direct budget&#13;
transfers, as is the case for coal, or through subsidized credits, which have been granted to the oil and&#13;
gas subsectors. Overall, there is a pressing need to continue to rationalize energy prices and reform&#13;
taxes; however, these policies entail far-reaching macroeconomic and structural implications. Recent&#13;
actions on tax reforms and reductions in subsidized credit have improved the situation considerably.&#13;
D.    Energy and the Environment&#13;
2.10   Russia's current environmental problems are serious and widespread, and result from past policies&#13;
that set performance targets in quantitative terms and did not place an economic value on the&#13;
environment, lack of environmental legislation, standards and management systems, and pricing policies&#13;
that undervalued natural resources. Russia's energy inefficiency, in both production and end-use, not&#13;
only accelerates the depletion of economic resources, but also represents a prime cause of pollution and&#13;
of natural resource degradation. Price reform, coupled with investment in more efficient technologies,&#13;
would help to correct this problem, and the government is therefore actively pursuing initiative in both&#13;
of these areas. Furthermore, environmental legislation is being steadily improved, both in terms of&#13;
establishing standards and enforcing their implementation.&#13;
E.    Organization of the Energy Sector and Structural Reform&#13;
2.11   Prior to 1990, energy was fully integrated into the FSU's national plan. The sector was managed&#13;
by central government ministries and by subsector or branch ministries. This centralization of authority,&#13;
together with the lack of coordination among those central ministries with authority over energy&#13;
subsectors, stifled commercial and operational initiatives in the sector and led to the pressure to&#13;
decentralize.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
2.12   Russia's energy sector is undergoing structural reform to ameliorate these problems. Goals of&#13;
the reform package include reduced state intervention, the promotion of competition, and a strong,&#13;
independent private sector. Since 1991, progress has been made regarding each of these objectives.&#13;
While policy matters remain under the jurisdiction of the ministries, branch ministries were converted&#13;
to large state-owned enterprises, which were to address commercial and operational matters for each&#13;
subsector. The new enterprises included: Rosneftegas, with jurisdiction over crude oil production;&#13;
Glavtransneft, crude oil transport; Rosnefteproduct, oil product transport and distribution; Gazprom, non-&#13;
associated gas production, transmission, storage and export; Rosstrojgasifikazia, gas distribution2; Ugol&#13;
Rossii, coal; and Rossenergo, electric power. Although distanced from the ministries, these state or&#13;
national concerns were wholly owned by the state and were still formally accountable to them. Selected&#13;
activities came under newly established committees rather than state concerns; for example, oil refining&#13;
under the Refining Committee within the Ministry of Fuel and Power, and oil exploration under the State&#13;
Committee on Geology (the former Ministry of Geology).&#13;
2.13   Following the creation of the state concerns, a period of further decentralization of control over&#13;
the sector began, which was fostered by certain parts of the reform movement in Government that&#13;
promoted competition. Other factions in the government, however, regarded this development as&#13;
potentially disruptive during a time when stability in energy supplies was vital, and thus argued for a&#13;
slowdown to the decentralization process. By and large, the Government has acceded to the latter&#13;
proposal.&#13;
2.14   As of the present, all of the state energy enterprises have been converted into joint stock&#13;
companies (JSC's). This is beneficial in that it sets the stage for corporatization of the enterprises along&#13;
coommercial lines and for their ultimate privatization. At the same time, a controlling interest in each of&#13;
the new JSCs is to be retained by the state. For the most part, administrative responsibility for the state's&#13;
shareholdings has been placed in the hands of a few centralized holding companies, which are themselves&#13;
either wholly owned or effectively controlled by the state. Privatization has entered a new phase in which&#13;
the government intends to sell its remaining equity stake in profitable enterprises at a price that would&#13;
provide a reasonable return on its original investment. This project is designed to further this objective&#13;
(see para 6.8).&#13;
F.     Foreign Direct Investment&#13;
2.15   Foreign direct investment in Russia's energy sector can make a critical difference: in funding;&#13;
in transferring technology; in promoting a competitive environment; and in transferring managerial skills&#13;
appropriate to a market economy. To date, however, the energy sector, like the rest of the economy,&#13;
has had little success in attracting major foreign investment. Investors have attributed this to the absence&#13;
of an accommodating legal and fiscal framework, to institutional uncertainties, and to understandable&#13;
confusions during a period of major transition. An important factor often mentioned by potential foreign&#13;
investors in the energy sector is the conflicting signals they receive from Russia; in the end, the investors&#13;
are not persuaded that their investments are welcomed.&#13;
2/     With the exception of Moscow and St. Petersburg, which were the responsibility of Mosgas and&#13;
Lengas, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
G.    Bank's Role in the Energy Sector&#13;
2.16   The Bank's energy strategy in Russia has been to support sector reform and recovery through&#13;
direct assistance to the Russian authorities in designing their reform program and in developing a focused&#13;
program of energy lending. The Bank assigned high priority to the oil and gas subsectors owing to: (a)&#13;
the potential to attract significant inflow of foreign investment capital; (b) their potential to generate&#13;
foreign exchange through exports; (c) the potential impact on the fiscal deficit through adjustment of&#13;
domestic prices and rationalization of taxes; and, (d) the prospect of an early impact on sector revenues&#13;
and export earnings.&#13;
2.17  Identification of suitable projects for lending has proceeded in parallel with technical cooperation.&#13;
The US$1 billion project to support urgently required oil production rehabilitation in western Siberia is&#13;
effective and procurement is advancing favorably. A second oil production rehabilitation project has also&#13;
been approved for which procurement is well advanced. Other projects in the oil subsector have been&#13;
identified including: (a) a joint venture for new field development; (b) a refinery restructuring investment;&#13;
and, (c) oil transport. In the gas sector, Gazprom, the entity responsible for production and transmission,&#13;
has been able to attract financing from other sources, leaving the Bank to focus on gas distribution and&#13;
energy efficiency investments.&#13;
2.18   The Bank has broadened its energy sector dialogue with the government to include other&#13;
subsectors, such as power and coal.3 Lending to the energy sector could range between US$500 million&#13;
and US$1 billion annually for the next several years. As indicated in the most recent Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS), the energy sector is expected to be a major focus of Bank lending, accounting for&#13;
roughly 40 percent of new commitments during the FY93-97 period. In particular, the CAS recognizes&#13;
that developments in the energy sector are critical to Russia's export prospects over the next several years&#13;
and therefore to the viability of the external financing program. In all cases, the highest priority would&#13;
be assigned to designing a lending program that would act as a catalyst to private sector investment.&#13;
Once the macroeconomic framework stabilizes and an acceptable investment framework has been&#13;
established, the Bank's relative role in Russia's energy sector should decline significantly, giving way to&#13;
private funding. The proposed Project is fully consistent with the Bank's policy objectives in the recent&#13;
CAS and represents a priority use of Bank resources in assisting the transformation of the Russian&#13;
economy.&#13;
111. GAS SUBSECTOR&#13;
A.    Gas Resources, Production and Exports&#13;
3.1    As of the beginning of 1993, Russia's gas reserves were estimated at 48 trillion cubic meters, 33&#13;
percent of l; e world's reserves. Gas production was 617 billion cubic meters (BCM) in 1993, down 3.5&#13;
percent from 1992, giving a reserve-to-production ratio of 78 years. The majority of production takes&#13;
place in western Siberia: in 1992, the Urenguoy field produced 288 BCM and Yamburg produced 178&#13;
BCM. Although associated gas production has typically been about 6 percent of total gas production,&#13;
it is estimated that a further 3 percent could be recovered by recapturing flared gas. In 1993, gas exports&#13;
from Russia included 65 BCM to Western Europe, and 36 BCM to Central Europe. Russian gas accounts&#13;
for 90 percent of the total with the remaining 10 percent transited through Russia from Turkmenistan.&#13;
3/     A portion of the Bank's first technical cooperation project (TCP) in Russia, approved by the Bank's&#13;
Board of Directors in September 1992, was allocated to coal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Compared with 1992, 1993 exports to Europe were up 5 percent. Exports to cther FSU republics,&#13;
however, fell by approximately 25 percent (from 106 BCM to 79 BCM), mainly owing to economic&#13;
restructuring and payment problems. Initial figures for 1994 indicate a further 3 percent growth in&#13;
exports to Western Europe, and a 10 percent increase in sales to Central Europe. Exports to FSU&#13;
republics in 1994 were at approximately the same level as in 1993.&#13;
3.2    Fields now in production are expected to meet demand through most of the remainder of the&#13;
decade, as gas consumption in the FSU continues to be rationalized. The Yamburg field alone has the&#13;
potential to deliver another 60 to 80 BCM/yr, roughly equivalent to the level of Russia's current exports&#13;
to Western Europe. Step-outs from the existing fields will also keep the cost of gas supply low for the&#13;
near to medium term. Russia's large unexploited fields (Yamal and Shtokmanskaya in the Barents Sea)&#13;
are remote and present considerable environmental problems. Postponing the need to mobilize these&#13;
resources would enable Gazprom to further address the environmental problems associated with the new&#13;
fields.&#13;
B.    Natural Gas Demand&#13;
3.3    Export Markets: Although the export market during the early 1990's has been relatively weak,&#13;
gas demand outside Russia is expected to rise in the medium to long term. Forecasts of exports of&#13;
Russian gas prepared in 1992 indicated an 8 percent overall decline between 1992 and 1994, with a&#13;
gradual levelling off and beginning recovery after 1997. The decline was dominated by a sharp drop in&#13;
exports to FSU countries. (see table in Annex 3-1). Preliminary 1994 data indicate continued growth&#13;
in gas markets in Central Europe, and a slower but steady increase in Western European demand.&#13;
Markets in the FSU countries remain weak, however. Russia is a major source of natural gas for Central&#13;
and Western European markets, and is viewed as the single most important source for future gas supplies.&#13;
Alternative sources of gas, which include Algeria, Iran, the North Sea, and the Central Asian Republics,&#13;
each face transit problems. Russia, however, has the potential to supply a significant portion of the&#13;
expected growth in European gas markets, and at competitive prices, as low-cost gas becomes available&#13;
from the rationalization of existing domestic markets and the capture of flared associated gas. Assuming&#13;
sufficient transmission capacity, Russia could expect not only to maintain but also to increase its share&#13;
in the European markets. Indications are, however, that transmission capacity may be a growing&#13;
constraint. The main transit route is through the Ukraine, and there are continued allegations that the&#13;
Ukraine is appropriating transit gas for its own use, in order to make up for Russian cutbacks in&#13;
deliveries to Ukraine as a result of payment arrears. Alternative routes through Poland/Belarus are being&#13;
explored, and would require in the order of US$5 billion in investment. At present, however, the&#13;
financing and the international ownership/operating agreements needed to develop this corridor are not&#13;
yet in place.&#13;
3.4    Domestic Market: Gas has been capturing an increasing share of the primary energy market in&#13;
Russia, displacing coal in the 1970s and petroleum products in the late 1980s. With coal and oil&#13;
production decreasing, gas continues to increase market share, nearing half of Russia's total primary&#13;
consumption. This trend is expected to continue as gas-based power generation increases, both for cost&#13;
and environmental reasons. Although fuel oil is currently the least cost fuel in some power plants, this&#13;
is expected to change when oil refineries are upgraded to rationalize the product mix and surpluses of fuel&#13;
oil decline.4 In the residential market, gas is also expected to replace some of the current LPG&#13;
4/     Refineries in Russia are of a simple configuration, producing much less of the lighter products than the&#13;
market would dictate and an excessive proportion of fuel oil. With the liberalization of petroleum product&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
consumption.&#13;
3.5    Overall, the domestic energy market is expected to contract over the next three to five years&#13;
owing to: (a) the general economic decline in Russia; (b) a shift away from heavy industry towards a&#13;
more services-oriented economy; (c) new investments in more energy-efficient technology; and, (d)&#13;
investments in energy efficiency in existing industries. Many of these changes have started to occur as&#13;
a result of energy price adjustments, and the active role taken by the government in support of energy&#13;
efficiency investments. Gas consumption in Russia is forecast to decline by 20 to 30 percent from the&#13;
1992 levels as a result of restructuring and efficiency gains. This decrease could be offset to a degree,&#13;
however, if gas takes the place of other fuels in industrial and commercial markets.&#13;
3.6    As illustrated in Table 3-1, most of domestic gas consumption has been in electric utilities,&#13;
including combined heat and power plants (44 percent) and in boilers (19 percent). Use in transmission&#13;
is also substantial at 12 percent of the total. Gas consumption in the commercial and residential sectors&#13;
(7 percent) is relatively low because much of the space and water heating demand is met by district&#13;
heating facilities.  Consumption in households and many commercial enterprises is not metered.&#13;
Households are charged fixed rates based on norns which are related to the types and number of&#13;
appliances, the number of occupants, and the physical size of the dwelling. Unmetered commercial&#13;
consumers are charged based on type of activity and the equipment they operate. Normns are adjusted&#13;
periodically. Adjustments are proposed by the gas distribution companies (GDCs), based on the&#13;
difference between quantities received at the city gate and quantities billed to metered customers.&#13;
Changes to the norns, however, require local government approval prior to implementation.&#13;

- 8 -&#13;
natural gas. Ninety percent of these are located in urban areas. Piped and bottled LPG are supplied to&#13;
3.3 and 13.3 million households, respectively, in areas where natural gas is not available.5 Residential&#13;
use of natural gas is mostly for cooking, while both space and water heating needs are generally met by&#13;
district heating, especially in urban areas. Average household consumption, at 865 cubic meters per year,&#13;
is therefore significantly lower than in other countries where gas is used directly for heating. However,&#13;
although no statistical information exists on the specific consumption, it appears that residential gas&#13;
consumption for cooking is about 300 m3/yr, that is, three to four times the usual figure of western&#13;
countries.6&#13;
3.8   In the absence of meters, the incentive for individual residential customers to reduce their&#13;
consumption to more acceptable levels is absent. At the same time, because the cost of excessive or&#13;
wasteful consumption is spread among all customers through the norms, customers who would prefer to&#13;
reduce their consumption, and hence their gas cost, are unable to do so. The lack of an incentive to&#13;
reduce consumption is further reinforced by heavily subsidized prices to residential customers, whose&#13;
monthly gas bill in mid-1994 averaged in the order of RR 144 (approximately US$0.07) - less than 1 %&#13;
of the minimum wage.&#13;
C.    Gas Balance&#13;
3.9   In general, the government has strongly supported gas exports both because of the higher&#13;
net-backs and the access to foreign exchange. As a result, gas is supply-constrained in Russia during the&#13;
peak winter months. This situation is expected to change considerably in the near to medium term as&#13;
both export and domestic markets evolve. Gas availability is expected to increase as a result of the&#13;
collapse in the markets of the FSU. This would lead to Russia's gas supply becoming demand-&#13;
constrained in the foreseeable future (see Annex 3-1), a situation that has already been manifested in the&#13;
summers of 1993 and 1994, when Gazprom was unable to find markets for gas that was available for&#13;
production. Hence, it is expected that many of the gas-supply projects that are planned for the late 1990s&#13;
will be deferred, and Gazprom will start to develop enhanced supply to the domestic market, including&#13;
gas storage to help meet winter peaks.&#13;
D.    Institutional Setting&#13;
3.10   Gazprom: Gazprom dominates the natural gas industry in Russia. Its monopoly on non-associated&#13;
gas production, gas transmission, storage and gas exports makes it the largest gas company in the world.&#13;
In addition, through the system of gas allocation, it strongly influences the Russian gas market. The scale&#13;
of Gazprom's operations, its financial strength, its control over domestic gas supply, and its access to&#13;
'oreign currency, combine to make it a dominant entity within the energy sector. Its contribution to&#13;
economic stability in a turbulent period of economic restructuring is an important and well recognized&#13;
factor. Through the range of its activities, and its direct access to the Council of Ministers, Gazprom&#13;
is able to strongly influence sectoral national policy, encroaching significantly on the role of the Ministry&#13;
of Fuel and Energy and probably other branches of government as well.&#13;
3.11   Gazprom was formed in 1991 as a state concern when the former ministry structure was&#13;
dismantled and the major branches of the energy sector were formed into separate entities with greater&#13;
5/     Does not include Moscow and St. Petersburg.&#13;
6/     In Western Europe, specific gas consumption for cooking averages between 70 and 100 m3/yr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
autonomy from the government. Although Gazprom has experienced two major changes in its reporting&#13;
structure, it has retained virtually the same internal organizational structure. Gazprom is strongly&#13;
managed from the center, at least at the strategic and policy-making level. This may be explained in part&#13;
by the central control of the financial resources of the enterprise, including control of foreign currency&#13;
and funds for capital investment. Gazprom became a joint stock company in February 1993 and its&#13;
shareholding is evolving. The government was to retain a 40 percent ownership for at least three years.&#13;
The remaining 60 percent was to be issued to employees (15 percent), to ethnic minorities in the Yamal-&#13;
Nenetsk region (5 percent), to Rossgazifikazia (I percent), and sold through a check-auction to citizens&#13;
across the country (29 percent). Provision was also made for Gazprom to sell 10 percent directly to&#13;
investors, including foreigners, in order to raise cash for development.&#13;
3.12   Rosstroigazifikazia (Rossgaz): Rossgaz, like Gazprom, was established in 1991 as a state concern&#13;
when the previous ministry structure was disaggregated. It was responsible for gas distribution, acting&#13;
as the intermediary agent between Gazprom's gas transmission companies and industrial, commercial and&#13;
residential customers in the regions. Rossgaz operated through 71 gas distribution companies (Oblgas)&#13;
at the regional (Oblast) administrative level. Each Oblgas in turn operated through a number of city and&#13;
district gas companies (Gorgas and Mejraygas, respectively). Some of these companies, typically those&#13;
located in industrial cities, were jurisdictionally independent gas companies; most of the companies&#13;
located in small towns and rural areas were simply departments of the Oblgas, however.&#13;
3.13   Under the technical cooperation agreement with the government, the Bank was asked to finance&#13;
a study on the commercialization and privatization of the Russian gas industry. The results of the first&#13;
phase of this study, presented in Moscow in September 1992, recommended that Rossgaz be de-&#13;
monopolized into separate, independent gas distribution companies (GDCs) and that its contracting arm&#13;
be split off as an independent company. In December 1992, the government issued a decree setting this&#13;
process in motion (for details, see Annex 3-2). By March 1993, a regulation was established to define&#13;
the process. GDCs were given the option of either 40 percent or 51 percent employee ownership, while&#13;
the remainder of the shares were to be held by the federal, regional and local Governments based on a&#13;
formula included in the regulation. The first GDC joint stock companies (JSCs) were formed in June&#13;
1993; by December 1993, this process was almost complete. Effectively, the management and&#13;
operational responsibilities formerly executed by Rossgaz have been transferred to the new JSCs, leaving&#13;
Rossgaz with an as yet poorly defined coordinating role. Recently, however, a twinning arrangement was&#13;
established between Rossgaz and the American Gas Association which may be fruitful in establishing a&#13;
vision for its role in Russia's evolving gas sector.&#13;
E.    Development Plan&#13;
3.14   Development plans for the gas sector in Russia have changed considerably in the recent past as&#13;
a result of privatization and the financial health of gas utilities. As gas utilities are established as JSCs,&#13;
they have become much more careful with their proposed capital budgets, cutting back proposed&#13;
investments to address only urgent needs. Gazprom has limited financing for system expansion owing&#13;
to a shortage in funds. As a result of the contracting market, GDCs are able to focus on system&#13;
rehabilitation rather than expansion. In addition, GDCs are focusing on investments that would enable&#13;
them to make the transition to commercially operated businesses by installing metering and billing on the&#13;
basis of consumption. These investments are expected to ultimately free up gas for export by inducing&#13;
energy efficiency investments (from both the supplier and the end-user).&#13;
3.15   Gazprom currently envisions the need to develop the Yamal gas field and had requested Bank&#13;
assistance in financing this project. The Bank did not actively pursued this project on the basis that: (a)&#13;
gas markets in Russia are expected to continue to contract; (b) gas consumption in other FSU republics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
has decreased considerably (particularly in the Ukraine); (c) flared gas and dome gas in oil fields could&#13;
increase gas supply by about 20 BCM/yr; (d) gas markets in Western Europe are expected to grow more&#13;
slowly, in the near term, than originally anticipated; and, (e) gas consumption in Gazprom's compressor&#13;
stations will decrease as they are replaced with more efficient units. Therefore, the Bank has proposed&#13;
an investment strategy that combines energy efficiency investments, rehabilitation of the gas networks,&#13;
and debottlenecking the existing export corridors to increase foreign exchange earnings. Gazprom is&#13;
actively exploring the possibility of establishing a major gas-export corridor through Belarus and Poland.&#13;
Because the development of the corridor would be a joint effort by entities in Poland, Belarus and Russia,&#13;
this route is expected to face fewer problems than those faced by the existing gas transit route through&#13;
Ukraine (although Gazprom is also actively pursuing investments in the Ukraine corridor). Together,&#13;
these investments could increase supply to Western Europe at a relatively low cost by debottlenecking&#13;
the existing pipeline system.&#13;
F.     Issues&#13;
3.16   There are four main issues that are central to the development of the gas sector within Russia,&#13;
and also to the success of the proposed project. These are: (a) the commitment on the part of the&#13;
government to an ongoing program of price increases; (b) the potential to increase the efficiency of gas&#13;
use in the country; (c) the format for regulation of the industry; and, (d) the ability of GDCs to function&#13;
as privatized corporate entities. Although these may be regarded as separate issues, in fact there are&#13;
strong interrelationships among them, as discussed below.&#13;
3.17   Pricing: Gas prices in Russia prior to 1990 enabled full cost recovery to the gas sector with the&#13;
exception of gas prices for households. As the exchange rate deteriorated and inflation rose rapidly, gas&#13;
price adjustments lagged. In January 1992, many prices were liberalized, but energy prices remained&#13;
heavily subsidized. During 1992, the price of many energy products were adjusted faster than inflation&#13;
with the notable exception of gas. However, gas prices caught up (in relative terms) to prices of other&#13;
fuels during 1993, with industrial prices at year-end nearly 20 times the level at the end of 1992, and&#13;
household prices about 7 times higher.&#13;
3.18   Since mid-1993, gas prices to industries have been adjusted monthly in line with domestic&#13;
inflation (see Table 3-2). Gas prices to households were theoretically to be increased every six months&#13;
with inflation. However, although several draft decrees were put forward to increase residential prices,&#13;
no adjustments were implemented until March, 1995, when Resolution 208 was adopted raising prices&#13;
by a factor of ten to RR 20,000/MCM (RR 16,260/MCM excluding VAT and special tax). At the same&#13;
time, the Government adopted a resolution which would devolve responsibility for setting residential gas&#13;
prices to the regional administrations. It is expected that this action will help to ensure more timely&#13;
adjustment of residential gas prices, and also to ensure that prices are more reflective of the cost&#13;
structures of the local gas distribution companies.&#13;
3.19   Given that gas is market-constrained (see para 3.9), the basis for pricing in the Russian market&#13;
should be the cost of supply. As the sector moves to commercial operations, it is recommended that&#13;
price-setting be based on financial principles, with full removal of input subsidies. (See Annex 3-3 for&#13;
a more detailed discussion of pricing principles.) As a result, gas prices to city gates would depend on&#13;
location because of the considerable component of gas transport in the total cost of supply. The cost of&#13;
supply to the city gates, assuming full cost recovery on the existing system at international cost levels,&#13;
is estimated to be about US$25-US$35/MCM. The incremental cost of supply to industries would add&#13;
about $3-5/MCM, putting estimated March 1995 gas prices to these customers at approximately two-&#13;
thirds of their target level based on current market exchange rates. Based on estimated purchasing power&#13;
parity exchange rates, the March gas prices to industrial customers are very close to their target level.&#13;

3.20   Because the assets of the existing gas system were originally financed by budget transfers from&#13;
the government, most Russian gas companies are profitable at current prices. While recent residential&#13;
prices have failed to cover the financial costs of service, residential sales are typically a small part of the&#13;
GDCs' sales. Margins on industrial sales are generally sufficient to offset these losses. However,&#13;
because future investments will be financed on commercial terms, gas prices to households will need to&#13;
be increased to maintain financial viability. Gas prices to industries are expected to reflect the full cost&#13;
of supply by the end of 1995. Prices to residential customers are expected to be adjusted more gradually,&#13;
reflecting households' limited ability to pay. The current target is to reach full supply cost pricing to&#13;
households by 1998. This position is viewed as acceptable, as long as the gas utilities remain financially&#13;
viable without input subsidies. The Bank is now assisting the government to establish a safety net for&#13;
the poor that would ensure that they could afford at least a lifeline level of utilities. Once this has been&#13;
established, increases in gas prices to households can be accelerated.&#13;
3.21   Proposed financial covenants for the project reflect the principle of financial viability by requiring&#13;
that future investments are financed under commercial borrowing terms and through internal cash&#13;
generation. Returns on capital employed would also be adequate to attract equity participation by private&#13;
investors within two to three years. Given their current financial position, GDCs can be financially&#13;
viable with gas prices to industries reaching full cost by December 1995 and gas prices to households at&#13;
about one third of their estimated full cost of supply. The proposed energy pricing study (see para 6.8)&#13;
will address other details of gas pricing including seasonality, gas allocation, long-term gas contracts, spot&#13;
pricing, and interruptible supply contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
3.22   Efficiency of Energv Use: As noted earlier, the efficiency of energy use in Russia is extremely&#13;
low. As a consequence, energy which might either be sold into export markets or left in the ground to&#13;
serve future needs is consumed wastefully in domestic markets. Limited pipeline and storage capacities&#13;
are also engaged in serving domestic markets when they might be better directed toward exports. Energy&#13;
efficiency investments would also increase industry's ability to pay, thus helping to address a growing&#13;
interagency accounts receivable problem (see para 5.26). Finally, increased energy efficiency would help&#13;
mitigate the impact of energy use on the environment.&#13;
3.23   The first prerequisite for energy conservation, price adjustments, continue to take place. Current&#13;
energy prices have already made a number of energy efficiency investments attractive with payback&#13;
periods as low as a few months. The single biggest constraint impeding the implementation of these&#13;
investments is the availability of capital. Financial markets in Russia are in disarray with a limited equity&#13;
market and a modest capacity to meet local debt financing needs. Financial sector reform is being&#13;
addressed separately, and is expected to help mitigate some of these problems. However, studies have&#13;
indicated that energy efficiency investments are not made unless returns are exceptionally high (at least&#13;
40 percent and typically higher). As a result, projects that are both economically and financially&#13;
attractive in Russia are expected to languish unless a proactive initiative is undertaken to promote such&#13;
investments.  Therefore, it is recommended that the already established Russian Energy Savings&#13;
Foundation (RESF) be used to ensure that these projects are encouraged through a combination of studies,&#13;
project preparation, information dissemination, and assistance to the government in administering the&#13;
onlending under this project.&#13;
3.24   The structure and mandate of the RESF are outlined in paragraphs 5.7 to 5.11. Although the&#13;
agency is generally considered capable of acting to support energy efficiency investments, some&#13;
institutional upgrading and support would need to be undertaken to ensure the project's success (see para&#13;
6.26).&#13;
3.25   Regulatorv Structure: There is a natural tendency toward monopolistic agencies in the business&#13;
of gas transmission and distribution.  The high cost of entry, the economies of scale in system&#13;
development and operation, and the spatial characteristics of supply networks discourage free competition&#13;
for markets among alternative suppliers. Some competition may be introduced by opening supplier access&#13;
to transmission pipelines, and by allowing local distribution companies to negotiate purchase contracts&#13;
with these alternate suppliers. Within the city gates, however, interfuel competition is more likely to&#13;
occur than competition among different gas distributors.&#13;
3.26   Within this climate, regulation is important to protect customers from monopolistic pricing. It&#13;
is equally important to protect the transmission and distribution companies, with their large fixed-asset&#13;
bases, from pricing controls that might jeopardize their ability to earn an adequate rate of return to&#13;
maintain and expand their system, and also to protect them from predatory actions by competitors. The&#13;
government has taken initiatives in this regard, introducing a draft law on natural and state monopolies,&#13;
with the assistance of foreign consultants. The draft law addresses the need to regulate gas markets, from&#13;
both the federal and regional perspectives. The Government has agreed to review the appropriate legal&#13;
and regulatory framework for the gas distribution subsector as part of the proposed Energy Pricing and&#13;
Privatization Studies, and to prepare an action plan to improve the regulatory framework .&#13;
3.27   Of more immediate concern, from the perspective of the viability of the gas distribution&#13;
subsector, is the issue of predatory competition. Over the past year, the gas transmission company&#13;
(Gazprom and its subsidiaries) has begun approaching some of the large customers that were being served&#13;
by local gas distributors and offering to provide direct supply. A number of customers have accepted&#13;
this offer, with serious repercussions to the profitability of the GDCs. If this practice persists, the GDCs&#13;
would lose a measure of their ability to cross-subsidize the unprofitable residential service through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
revenues from industrial supply (see para 3.21). In addition, because the outlook for demand growth is&#13;
generally weak, the GDCs will be obliged to amortize their largely fixed costs over a smaller number of&#13;
units sold, with adverse impacts on their financial performance. The Government's recent resolution to&#13;
devolve responsibility for setting residential gas prices to the local administrations (see para 3.19) will&#13;
provide some protection to the financial viability of the GDCs, since it will facilitate adjustment of&#13;
residential prices to reflect the actual cost structure and customer mix of the distribution company.&#13;
3.28   Corporatization and Privatization of the Gas Distribution Sector:  The rapid pace at which&#13;
Rossgaz has been subdivided into a number of JSCs is an encouraging beginning to the corporatization&#13;
and privatization of the gas distribution sector. The next major steps will include shifting the orientation&#13;
of the companies' management and operating philosophies toward customer service and profit and cost&#13;
management, and generating a stream of projected earnings sufficient to attract equity capital. Achieving&#13;
these objectives would allow the state to divest their shares in the companies at a price that adequately&#13;
compensates them for their past investments. The government has requested support for a study to&#13;
identify the next steps in the privatization process, with a view to the ultimate full privatization of the&#13;
GDCs. Funds for the study are included as part of the technical assistance component of this project (see&#13;
para 6.8).   The corporatization program  would be advanced under the project through the&#13;
twinning/training arrangements with a foreign GDC (see para 6.13).&#13;
IV. LESSONS LEARNED FROM EARLIER BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
A      Relevant Experience&#13;
4.1    The first Bank loan to the energy sector in Russia was the Oil Rehabilitation Project (Loan&#13;
number 3623-0, approved in 1993). It is too early to draw many general lessons from this loan with&#13;
regard to Bank involvement in the Russian energy sector. Within two months of the project being&#13;
declared effective, over 50 percent of the initial bids had been evaluated by the borrower. This was an&#13;
unusually fast response to procurement, and reflected the borrowers' commitment to the project and the&#13;
intensive effort on procurement during project preparation. However, since that time, numerous delays&#13;
have arisen, many of which can be attributed to the lack of Borrower experience with Bank financing and&#13;
international procurement, and to ongoing changes in the political and economic environment. As a&#13;
result, actual disbursement on the project has been slow with almost 90 percent undisbursed as of the end&#13;
of February 1995.&#13;
4.2    The Bank has approved loans for natural gas development in a number of other countries with&#13;
a view to increasing its supply and commercial utilization. Lending for gas projects has increased in the&#13;
recent past because of its low environmental impact.  Project success is largely a function of the&#13;
commercialization of the executing agency. Strategies for achieving this objective include the following:&#13;
*     separating the government's policy and regulatory role from the commercial role of enterprises&#13;
*     stimulating private sector interests in exploration and production of gas&#13;
*     mobilizing external financial resources&#13;
*     introducing a rational gas pricing policy.&#13;
4.3    The Bank has also financed energy efficiency investments, and provided support for the&#13;
development of energy efficiency programs in a number of countries: Peru, Portugal, Hungary, Tunisia,&#13;
Indonesia, Yugoslavia, and India. Hungary (1983, 1986, and 1989) is the closest model, where&#13;
financing was made available through the Energy Efficiency Office of the National Bank of Hungary&#13;
(which was set up under the first loan) to finance subprojects in energy efficiency. The first two loans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
were generally successful because of the government's interest in promoting energy efficiency and&#13;
because of central control which facilitated implementation. The third project was less successful, in part&#13;
because the uncertain economic climate in Hungary during the transition period served to discourage&#13;
investments.&#13;
B      Lessons Learned&#13;
4.4    Although there is considerable scope for attracting equity investments for exploration and&#13;
development projects for oil, only limited foreign risk capital has been available for gas projects&#13;
worldwide, particularly where the gas is to be sold on the domestic market. As a result, as a lender of&#13;
last resort, the Bank has provided financing for gas transmission and distribution projects in a number&#13;
of countries.&#13;
4.5    Lessons learned from gas transmission and distribution projects and from energy efficiency&#13;
projects include the following:&#13;
*     The Bank often limits itself to the introduction of covenants to ensure the financial viability of&#13;
transmission and distribution companies. Poor pricing policies, however, have also led to a lack&#13;
of counterpart funds, delaying the implementation of some projects. Rational pricing policy&#13;
targets for natural gas pricing and indexation formulas should be agreed as conditionality up&#13;
front.&#13;
*      A strong government commitment to institutional change is essential. A long-term view is&#13;
needed, given that all of the goals of institutional development will not be achieved within the&#13;
time span of one project.&#13;
*      Experience also shows that project implementation hinges on the availability of a well-organized&#13;
project unit to act as a counterpart.&#13;
*      Experience from other projects has shown that implementation and procurement is improved&#13;
when the number of institutions involved in a project are minimized and definitions of project&#13;
components are precise.&#13;
*      Training should be approached from the perspective of the entire institution so that the quality&#13;
is enhanced all round and the benefits are sustained.&#13;
*      Implementation of energy efficiency projects has been mixed, but appears to have required&#13;
incentives or impetus beyond that of simple a-ailability of commercial funds.&#13;
4.6    These lessons have been incorporated into the current project. The Bank has established ongoing&#13;
policy dialogue with the government regarding pricing and institutional reform. Although energy price&#13;
adjustments lagged early on, considerable adjustment has taken place since the beginning of 1993. The&#13;
government's commitment to reforms has been demonstrated both on the pricing issue and on institutional&#13;
reform, with gas distribution becoming demonopolized and joint stock companies established. The&#13;
employees of Volgograd Gorgas, one of the beneficiaries under the project, have elected for a 51 percent&#13;
ownership stake, indicating their resolve to make their company profitable. At the same time, Volgograd&#13;
Gorgas has demonstrated an awareness of the risks and responsibilities inherent in the project, and a&#13;
commitment to proceeding quickly.  Training for their staff will be accomplished through a&#13;
training/twinning arrangement, established through co-financing from bilateral resources. This training&#13;
will address all aspects of corporate management and operations. Finally, past failure to disburse lines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
of credit for energy efficiency investments is being addressed by pre-identifying and reviewing a number&#13;
of subprojects, by offering competitive financing terms, and by involving the government agency&#13;
responsible for energy efficiency in the implementation process.&#13;
V. INSTITUTIONS&#13;
A.    Organization and Management&#13;
5 1    The general organization and management of Volgograd Gorgas, and of the Russian Energy&#13;
Savings Foundation (RESF) which would administer the energy efficiency onlending process, are outlined&#13;
in the following sections. Additional detail is provided in Annex 5-1.&#13;
Volgograd Gorgas&#13;
5.2    Volgograd Gorgas distributes natural gas and LPG to customers in the city of Volgograd, a city&#13;
of approximately 1 million persons located 900 km southeast of Moscow. The company delivers&#13;
approximately 3.6 BCM of gas annually, with more than 90 percent being consumed by industrial plants&#13;
(75 percent of sales go to 32 large industrial customers). Typically, a Gorgas sells up to 50 percent of&#13;
its gas for power generation, but most of the electricity in the Volgograd area is supplied by large&#13;
hydroelectric generating stations and therefore the Gorgas does not have a large power plant in its&#13;
customer base.&#13;
5.3    Day-to-day management of the organization is directed by a Management Committee consisting&#13;
of the general director, the chief engineer, the deputy general director in charge of procurement, and the&#13;
heads of planning, accounting and gas distribution and payment. The company has approximately 1,000&#13;
employees. These workers are now among the best paid in the city, and there are no vacancies and&#13;
limited turnover. The relatively high pay levels have also enabled the company to recruit qualified&#13;
graduates in engineering and other disciplines; this had not been possible in the past.&#13;
5.4    Prior to September 1993, gas distribution in the region was the responsibility of Volgograd&#13;
Oblgas, which operated through 17 subregional operating groups. Each of these operating groups chose&#13;
to become a separate independent JSC under privatization. The largest unit, Volgograd Gorgas,&#13;
submitted its application for JSC status along with the others in September 1993. Although the federal&#13;
authorities approved the application almost immediately, there was a long delay before final approval was&#13;
given by the local authorities. Local approval was given in early April 1994 and registration was&#13;
completed on April 14th. Employees hold 51 percent of the shares of the company, with the remaining&#13;
49 percent of shares allocated to federal (29 percent) and municipal (20 percent) authorities. The rights&#13;
of the shares allocated to the federal authorities will be passed first to the local GKI (Goskomimuschestvo&#13;
- State Committee for Management of State Property) and then to the Oblgas.&#13;
5.5    The initial Board of Directors of the joint stock company consists of the general director as&#13;
chairman, a representative of the municipality, the general director of the Oblgas representing the block&#13;
of federal shares owned by GKM, an elected member of the Duma and an employee representative. The&#13;
shareholders are to elect a new board at a general meeting to be held within twelve months of becoming&#13;
privatized. No consideration has yet been given to future dividend policy although senior management&#13;
believes that the best policy would be to reinvest all profits for the first three years.&#13;
5.6    The Gorgas's senior management is generally competent, positive, forward-looking and attuned&#13;
to future demands and challenges. British Gas has discussed with the senior management the main areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
in which a twinning/training arrangement would assist its future development, and has taken the initial&#13;
steps in implementing the twinning relationship. The management is enthusiastic about such a scheme,&#13;
and the Gorgas is likely to benefit substantially from the opportunity to expand its perspective. Details&#13;
of the expected scope of the twinning arrangement are set out in Annex 6-2.&#13;
Russia Energy Savings Foundation&#13;
5.7    The Russian Non-budgetary Inter-branch Energy Saving Foundation (RESF) was established under&#13;
Order 107a of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, dated August 3, 1992, pursuant to the Russian&#13;
Govemment Decree number 371 on energy conservation, dated June 1, 1992. The agency is intended&#13;
to operate at both the regional and federal level, through Regional Non-budgetary Energy Saving Funds&#13;
as well as through the Federal Non-budgetary Foundation. Copies of the organization's charter and&#13;
regulation are attached as Annex 5-1.&#13;
5.8    The mandate of the organization is to assist in implementing the government's policies on energy&#13;
efficiency, specifically addressing issues that affect multiple sectors. Its envisioned activities include:&#13;
(a) financing scientific studies, drafting of norms and regulations, and working on standardization of&#13;
energy consumption; (b) providing equity financing to assist in implementation of energy efficiency&#13;
measures; (c) providing financial support to the development of the manufacture of energy saving and&#13;
energy efficient equipment and materials; and, (d) providing preferred credit to small and medium energy&#13;
saving projects which meet specified technical and economic criteria.&#13;
5.9    The organization of the RESF is shown in Annex 5-1. The management group includes the&#13;
chairman, two vice-presidents (of technology and economics) and four department heads (of projects and&#13;
appraisals, regional programs, loans and finance, and external relations). There are also 11 sector&#13;
branches which focus on the needs of specific sectors or functions. Total staff complement is about 35,&#13;
of whom 25 are full time and the remainder perform their functions on a part time basis along with&#13;
regular jobs in the various ministries. There are also approximately 30 consultants or "experts" working&#13;
under contract. In addition, 12 regional centers have been established, consistent with the concept of&#13;
regional energy savings funds. The latter are independent of the RESF, but have a representative on the&#13;
RESF Board. The Board of Directors also consists of the chairman of the RESF, the vice-presidents and&#13;
the department heads.&#13;
5.10   Overall control and direction is provided by a Council of Observers, which is composed of&#13;
representatives from the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Science and Fuels and Energy. The Council&#13;
is intended to endorse basic strategy and policy, and audit one or two major projects per year to ensure&#13;
that the RESF meets its objectives.&#13;
5.11   Originally, the RESF was to be financially independent of the budget, with funding coming from&#13;
a number of sources including special taxes, fines and other assessments. The legislation to implement&#13;
the various funding mechanisms for the agency was introduced in the Duma, but was left outstanding&#13;
when the Duma was dissolved in late September 1993. At present, the future of the legislation is in&#13;
doubt. In the interim, funding has come mainly from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and other&#13;
ministries. In 1993, the RESF spent about RR 0.5 billion, primarily on research and development. The&#13;
proposed 1994 budget is for RR 22 billion for both R&amp;D and capital projects.' Current operating&#13;
expenses for staffing, consultants and overheads are RR 20 million/month (based on late 1993 salary&#13;
levels).&#13;
7/     The large increase in the R&amp;D and capital budget is attributable in part to an eight-fold inflation during&#13;
1993, and also to increased commitment of funds from local and foreign sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B.    Legal Status&#13;
5.12   Volgograd Gorgas is a Russian Joint Stock company, with 51 percent of the shares held by&#13;
employees. The legal status of the RESF has been laid out in its charter. The Bank's legal staff has&#13;
reviewed this document, and found no barrier to the RESF's proposed role in implementing the project.&#13;
The proceeds of the loan designated for the energy efficiency investments would be on-lent directly from&#13;
the Ministry of Finance to the beneficiaries, with the RESF acting only in an administrative capacity.&#13;
C.    Accounting Systems&#13;
5.13   Russian accounting developed as an integral part of the Soviet economic system and is mandatory&#13;
in nature, as opposed to being generally accepted. All Russian enterprises utilize the national accounting&#13;
systems, which are based on a unified chart of accounts and specified rules for recording all transactions.&#13;
A new unified system of accounts was introduced in February 1992, and is being adopted by gas&#13;
distribution companies (GDCs).  This system, based partly on international Generally Accepted&#13;
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and arising from a United Nations-sponsored accounting review, is&#13;
considered to be an improvement over the previous unified system but still dictates the recording of all&#13;
financial transactions based on standardized rules and accounts and not on accounting principles.'&#13;
Accrual-based accounting was adopted in principle in 1992 and implementation is currently underway.&#13;
At present, however, accounting practices reflect a blend of accrual and cash-based principles.&#13;
5.14   Currently, balance sheets are similar to those prepared under international financial standards,&#13;
both in structure and in terms of continuity principles. Income statements, however, summarize profits&#13;
primarily for tax purposes, and also summarize the distribution of any surplus remaining at year end.&#13;
Because the Russian system recognizes revenues and expenses on a cash rather than on an accrual basis,&#13;
income statements reflect only the revenues and costs associated with transactions for which payment was&#13;
received. A more comprehensive outline of the total value and cost of goods sold during the accounting&#13;
period is contained in a separate statement on costs of production, which covers all costs (including&#13;
capital costs) incurred during the accounting period. These "parallel" statements more closely conform&#13;
to western-style accrual systems, although year-end adjustments to reflect prepayments and accruals are&#13;
rare.&#13;
5.15   Depreciation is computed and recorded on an individual item basis. Inventories also are recorded&#13;
item-by-item (materiality is not an issue under Russian accounting law). Maximum depreciation rates are&#13;
specified for various classes of assets. Assets were revalued at the end of 1992 to bring them to 1992&#13;
price levels, and again at the beginning of 1994 to bring them to 1993 prices. A similar revaluation has&#13;
been decreed to take place in early 1995. Revaluation is carried out only in response to a government&#13;
decree, which in turn stipulates the multipliers to be used for different classes of assets and different years&#13;
of acquisition. The revaluation in early 1994 raised the value of fixed assets of the gas distribution&#13;
companies by an average factor of about 20.&#13;
5.16   The accounting system  in Volgograd Gorgas generally provides an adequate structure for&#13;
8/     A number of other initiatives in general accounting reform are underway including (a) EU funding of&#13;
on-going work in accounting reform by the International Advisory Board (a group of Russian government,&#13;
academic and international experts), (b) UN sponsored translation of well known US accounting text books, (c)&#13;
the British Council's funding of training courses for 40 accounting trainers, and (d) World Bank funding of&#13;
training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
maintaining project accounts. Records are maintained locally, and the law requires that all transactions&#13;
be appropriately documented. The Gorgas is in the process of automating their accounting systems,&#13;
although the process is hindered by a lack of finances, trained staff, and appropriate software. Most&#13;
Russian accounting software is poorly designed, and with the volatility of the Russian chart of accounts,&#13;
quickly out of date. Thus, the company is developing its own purpose-built software.&#13;
5.17   The management infornation systems of Volgograd Gorgas will require improvement since they&#13;
have been geared to satisfying the information requirements of the ministries, and not those of internal&#13;
management or shareholders. Increasingly, the Gorgas will be required to make strategic decisions which&#13;
were previously made by the government. Capital budgeting procedures and criteria will need to be&#13;
developed and supported by the information system. Management cost accounting and cash management&#13;
will also be important factors which may require modification in the financial information system.&#13;
5.18   During discussions with Volgograd Gorgas, it was agreed that financial advisory services would&#13;
be provided as part of technical assistance to the project implementation team. Specialists would help&#13;
to ensure that project accounting procedures meet the Bank's requirements, provide short term advisory&#13;
services in critical areas such as cash management, assist in the preparation of financial statements which&#13;
conform to international standards and provide training in international accounting practice. The need&#13;
for computer hardware and software to assist them in meeting the financial reporting and control&#13;
requirements of the project were also discussed (see para 6.8).&#13;
5.19   A  longer term consideration, particularly associated with privatization, will be the need to&#13;
reestablish the financial position of Volgograd Gorgas. Current balance sheets are misleading for a&#13;
number of reasons. The historic cost basis and arbitrary revaluation of fixed assets results in the serious&#13;
understatement of the current economic value of some of the assets, and in the overstatement of the worth&#13;
of technologically outdated or obsolete items. The balance sheet also typically contains non-gas assets&#13;
(such as social infrastructure). Unrecoverable receivables and obsolete or over-valued assets currently&#13;
on the balance sheets will need to be written off. A physical inventory will be required as a prerequisite&#13;
to revaluation, with full valuation only possible once a stable fiscal and regulatory framework is&#13;
established. These issues will be addressed as part of the proposed privatization study (see para 6.8).&#13;
D.    External and Internal Audits&#13;
5.20   Enterprises are obliged to submit to the government quarterly income statements, balance sheets&#13;
and statements of value and cost of goods sold. Generally, gas distribution companies do not have formal&#13;
external audit arrangements.  External audits are only required in the case of foreign joint&#13;
venture/subsidiary operations, conmmercial banks, insurance companies, and investment funds. GDCs&#13;
are subject to annual tax inspections (compliance audits), however. Tax audits are adversarial and involve&#13;
checking that all transactions have been recorded in accordance with Russian law, as well as ensuring that&#13;
income, expenditures, depreciation and capital investments have been accurately reflected in the&#13;
calculation of corporate taxes due. Internal accounting controls are maintained through the internal audit&#13;
department within the GDCs, which typically have two to four staff. (Total accounting staff range from&#13;
8 to 18 people.) A typical GAAP audit based on Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) is not&#13;
required, and it is not clear what it would entail at this time.&#13;
5.21   Currently, more than 2,000 firmns offer independent audit services in Russia, including the major&#13;
international firms. Many of the Russian firms, however, also engage in trading and other conmmercial&#13;
activities. A more realistic measure of those that solely provide accounting and auditing services would&#13;
be closer to 200. The international accounting firms are well established in Russia, some with a large&#13;
contingent of Russian accountants and auditors trained in GAAP. Most of the Russian audit firms only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
provide accounting and audit services in accordance with Russian statutory requirements. As of January&#13;
1994, eight Russian firms have been accredited to audit project accounts on behalf of the Bank.&#13;
However, corporate audits based on GAAP are still the domain of the international accounting firms.&#13;
5.22   The audit firms in Russia currently operate without license or regulation. While there are a&#13;
number of associations of auditors, there is no authorized body responsible for licensing, setting&#13;
standards, or promoting the training and development of practitioners. In 1993, the Russian legislature&#13;
deliberated on draft legislation for auditing, which defined auditing independence and application,&#13;
prescribed licensing and regulatory arrangements, established auditors' rights and duties, and prescribed&#13;
the form of the auditor's report. The law was passed through the legislature but vetoed by the Executive&#13;
Branch. In its stead, a decree on Temporary Rules for Audit was issued, to become effective on&#13;
December 1, 1993. The decree covered much of the same ground but gave the executive branch&#13;
considerably more authority and oversight over the auditing industry.&#13;
5.23   Volgograd Gorgas has agreed to ensure that their accounts are subject to an annual independent&#13;
audit by an external auditor acceptable to the Bank. For purposes of project evaluation, the current&#13;
system of reporting and tax audits is considered acceptable. As the application of GAAS becomes more&#13;
widespread, the Gorgas will be expected to present its statements in this fashion. The proposed&#13;
twinning/training program should assist in this regard as financial staff gain experience in European and&#13;
North American utility accounting principles and practices.  Volgograd Gorgas has examined the&#13;
possibility of appointing external auditors, but at present, cost is a deterrent. As the audit industry&#13;
expands, and the distribution companies accumulate revenues, annual GAAP audits are likely to become&#13;
routine, and even mandated by the shareholders.&#13;
5.24   Reporting requirements were discussed with Volgograd Gorgas, and the company has agreed to&#13;
fiurnish to the Bank:&#13;
(a)    financial statements, within three months of the end of each fiscal year;&#13;
(b)    audited project accounts, beginning with the account for fiscal year 1995, within six&#13;
months of the end of each fiscal year;&#13;
(c)    audited financial statements (including a qualified restatement in accordance with GAAP&#13;
if required) showing their performance and position beginning with fiscal year 1995,&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year; and,&#13;
(d)    by October 1 of every year, a copy of the budget for the next financial year, clearly&#13;
indicating how the financial targets can be met.&#13;
E.    Financial Situation and Prospects&#13;
5.25   Volgograd Gorgas was profitable in 1993 and, based on preliminary estimates, was also profitable&#13;
in 1994. The program of sustained increases in industrial gas prices, together with reasonable control&#13;
over cost of production, has enabled them to show net profits and a reasonable return on revalued assets.&#13;
Sunmmaries of financial performance in 1992 and 1993 are contained in the pro forma financial statements&#13;
in Annex 8-3. Data from earlier years have not been provided because of frequent changes in the chart&#13;
of accounts and recording requirements over recent years, and the distorting effects of inflation.&#13;
5.26   While the Gorgas performed satisfactorily in 1993, they experienced significant increases in&#13;
accounts receivable towards the latter part of the year, which led to corresponding increases in payables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
and to reductions in the revenues recorded for tax purposes. The company's effectiveness in controlling&#13;
arrears has been less than ideal, with totals approaching the equivalent of three months sales. A listing&#13;
of possible steps to redress the accounts receivable problem has been provided to Volgograd Gorgas, and&#13;
management has been encouraged to act on these suggestions. Decree No. 307 (April 8, 1994) "on&#13;
increasing customer responsibility for payment for fuel and energy resources" also provides a strong&#13;
support for addressing the arrears problem, dictating that energy supply is to be curtailed and&#13;
subsequently cut off in the event of nonpayment (see Annex 5-2 for a copy of the decree).&#13;
5.27   Generally speaking, Volgograd Gorgas has been generous in their payments to employee-&#13;
shareholders. Excess payroll tax in 1993 (taxes payable on salaries in excess of four times the minimum&#13;
wage) amounted to 30 percent of wages.' In addition to paying high wages, the Gorgas distributed over&#13;
70 percent of its after-tax profits in the form of special payments and bonuses to employees. If the&#13;
company continues to maintain this rate of supplementary payment, its ability to finance local costs and&#13;
debt service under the project would be jeopardized. The company was alerted to this risk, and has since&#13;
undertaken initial discussions with their proposed twinning partner, British Gas, on dealing with this&#13;
issue.&#13;
5.28   Volgograd Gorgas had also adopted the undesirable practice of reducing its depreciation charges&#13;
in 1994 to 50 percent of the level allowable under accounting regulations. The rationale is that because&#13;
excess payroll taxes must be paid out of after-tax profits, there must be sufficient profits recorded to&#13;
cover these taxes. The company's projections indicate that if full depreciation were charged, profits&#13;
would not be sufficient. They therefore opted to reduce depreciation charges to maintain their current&#13;
wage levels. Analysis of projected revenues and expenses suggests that the company's concerns are&#13;
unwarranted. If they were valid, the preferred course of action would be to reduce salaries and/or staff&#13;
complements. Again, the company was alerted to the risks in this practice, and were advised that&#13;
financial performance would have to be recalculated based on conventional depreciation allowances to&#13;
establish compliance with the financial covenants.&#13;
5.29   Although the current financial position and outlook of Volgograd Gorgas is generally positive,&#13;
it is also apparent that outside agencies can have a significant impact on their financial prospects and&#13;
performance. A number of instances were cited in which the regional and/or municipal governments&#13;
regarded the profitability of local GDCs as an opportunity to improve the revenues flowing to the budget.&#13;
Thus, in some instances GDCs have been denied mandated subsidies (for example, to cover losses on the&#13;
distribution of LPG), assigned special "taxes", barred from cutting off non-paying customers, or&#13;
somewhat arbitrarily assessed higher corporate taxes and attendant fines. While tax legislation limits the&#13;
rates at which local governments are allowed to tax companies in their area, there are a number of ways&#13;
in which these governments can influence the companies' financial performance. Thefederal government,&#13;
and the Bank supervision missions, will need to monitor the regions' actions and the impacts on the&#13;
subsidiary borrowers, as part of its obligations under the loan agreement.&#13;
9/     As of 1994, excess payroll tax will be applied at a rate of 35 percent on that portion of salaries which&#13;
are greater than six times the minimum wage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
6.1    The principal objectives of the project are: (a) to increase the efficiency of gas use within Russia&#13;
by upgrading and increasing the use of customer metering and by supporting investments in more efficient&#13;
equipment; (b) to reduce gas distribution costs, and maintain distribution system capacity and integrity,&#13;
through network rehabilitation; and, (c) to support the government's reform program through technical&#13;
assistance. The objectives will be realized both directly through project-financed investments and&#13;
indirectly through demonstration impacts.&#13;
6.2    More efficient use of gas will increase the availability of energy for export, either by increasing&#13;
the supply of exportable gas from existing fields, or by making gas available to replace domestic use of&#13;
other fuels, thereby freeing up other energy products for export. Increased gas exports will increase&#13;
financial flows to the government, which currently captures approximately 30 percent of the export value.&#13;
Increased energy efficiency will reduce the operating costs of domestic gas users, thus increasing their&#13;
competitiveness and potentially reducing the inter-agency arrears problem. Increasing the efficiency of&#13;
gas use will also have a beneficial effect on the environment, both directly through decreased emissions,&#13;
and indirectly by enabling increased substitution of gas for fuels that have a less favorable environmental&#13;
impact.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
6.3    The project was prepared by Volgograd Gorgas and RESF, with the assistance of USAID-&#13;
financed consultants. The project includes three main components, each of which comprises several sub-&#13;
components. The components are: (a) rehabilitation of gas distribution systems; (b) energy efficiency&#13;
investments; and, (c) technical assistance to support the government's reform program and project&#13;
implementation. In addition, a companion Global Environment Facility (GEF) project will support&#13;
initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions including financing a portion of the leak detection&#13;
sub-component. The major project components are briefly described below.&#13;
6.4    Rehabilitation of gas distribution system:  This component will be implemented by the gas&#13;
distribution company in Volgograd and will include the following sub-components:&#13;
6.5    Metering: Under the project, the GDC will purchase approximately 48,000 meters. New meters&#13;
will be installed at unmetered commercial enterprises, households, and apartment blocks. Pilot schemes&#13;
undertaken elsewhere in Russia have reportedly resulted in decreases in gas consumption which range&#13;
from 25 to 50 percent. The replacement of outdated industrial and commercial meters will bring about&#13;
improved accuracy in recording consumption. Individual meters will be installed in houses that use gas&#13;
for space heating, water heating, and cooking, while commercial-type meters will be installed in&#13;
apartment-blocks to allow for billing groups of customers (typically, I meter will correspond to one riser,&#13;
i.e., about 20 to 30 customers).&#13;
6.6    Asset Preservation:   The preservation of the existing asset value will include five main&#13;
investments:  (a) pipeline replacement of about 10 km/yr, located mainly in older sections of the city&#13;
where pipelines were laid about 40 years ago; (b) cathodic protection of the entire system, because the&#13;
current cathodic protection system is generally ineffective; (c) leak detection and test equipment (partially&#13;
financed by GEF) for the detection of gas leaks, because the quality of existing equipment is inadequate;&#13;
(d) SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system, to monitor system pressures and flows,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
to initiate changes to match system requirements and to provide better information for operations and&#13;
investment planning; and, (e) network modeling tools, to carry out engineering analysis for system&#13;
capacity and design.&#13;
6.7    Energy Efficiency Investments:  The energy efficiency component will finance the foreign&#13;
currency portion of investments that are designed to improve energy efficiency for district heating and&#13;
power utilities. It will also provide assistance to end users in evaluating and implementing investments.&#13;
Because there are likely to be a large number of subprojects and borrowers, administration and&#13;
management of this component of the project will be handled by RESF with the assistance of consultants,&#13;
under the supervision of its board. RESF will be responsible for: (a) assisting potential executing&#13;
agencies in identifying subprojects and in presenting their technical, economic and financial viability;&#13;
(b) appraising energy efficiency investments by municipal utilities (district heating) and power plants and&#13;
advising the Ministry of Finance on the feasibility of financing these subprojects; and, (c) providing&#13;
assistance and disseminating information to industrial enterprises to evaluate and access commercial&#13;
funding for energy efficiency measures. The recommended investments for increased efficiency include,&#13;
inter alia: burner replacement and associated controls; boiler replacement at municipal district heating&#13;
companies; portable diagnostic instrumentation for power plants and municipal boilers so as to facilitate&#13;
better adjustment of the equipment;  automated control systems at boiler plants; and automatic&#13;
temperature control equipment and heat energy meters at heating substations.&#13;
6.8    Training and Technical Assistance: The project includes a number of technical assistance&#13;
components, which will provide support for project implementation, institutional strengthening, and&#13;
support for policy development. The technical assistance will include: (a) assisting Volgograd Gorgas&#13;
with project implementation; (b) providing ongoing training and support by establishing a twinning&#13;
arrangement with a foreign GDC; (c) providing training and technical assistance to RESF staff, focusing&#13;
on upgrading and expanding project analysis skills of staff, including investment appraisal and financial&#13;
planning and control (project financing, pro forma cash budgets, project monitoring and control); (d)&#13;
upgrading the current gas industry standards and construction procedures; (e) preparing a third party&#13;
access decree for the gas industry; (f) preparing specific tariff recommendations for gas transport; (g)&#13;
preparing recommendations for an energy pricing strategy; (h) preparing recommendations on the&#13;
privatization of the gas sector; (i) consulting assistance for a gas law and regulatory requirements; (j)&#13;
preparing an overall plan for gas distribution system rehabilitation; and, (k) support for co-ordination&#13;
of these studies. Draft terms of reference are included in Annex 6-2.&#13;
6.9    Global Enviromnent Facility: The GEF facility will complement this project by financing&#13;
studies on gas production, transmission, distribution and utilization to develop an investment program for&#13;
reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Projects that would not otherwise be commercially&#13;
attractive will then be proposed for financing by the GEF. The study of the gas production and&#13;
transmission components will be carried out by Gazprom. The gas distribution component will relate&#13;
directly to this project and will provide leak detection equipment and consultants to assist in preparing&#13;
a program for methane leakage reduction. The gas utilization portion will also be undertaken in&#13;
conjunction with this project; it will include financing for emissions detection equipment, energy&#13;
efficiency investments (such as heat energy meters and insulation), and consultants to assist in the&#13;
implementation of the energy efficiency improvement program.&#13;
C.    Project Cost Estimates&#13;
6.10 Total Project Cost: The total project cost is estimated at US$131.4 million. Foreign currency&#13;
costs are estimated to be US$111.2 million (85 percent of the total). Table 6-1 summarizes the total&#13;
estimated project cost.&#13;

and the local cost is US$12.9 million (26 percent of the total). The cost estimate is detailed in Annex&#13;
6-3. The base cost of this component is estimated to be US$35.2 million (in mid-1993 dollars&#13;
equivalent), excluding taxes, duties, contingencies and implementation assistance. The addition of physical&#13;
and price contingencies increases this amount to US$46.5 million. Import duties (5 percent on imported&#13;
goods) and implementation assistance brings this total to US$49.8 million. VAT has been excluded from&#13;
the estimates.'°&#13;
6.12   Investments in Energy Efficiency: The project feasibility study identified a sample of high-&#13;
return, fast-disbursing subprojects in Volgograd plus Ryazan, Saratov and Voronezh, that amounted to&#13;
US$50 million. Based on this estimate, US$58 million has been allocated for this component. During&#13;
appraisal, three or four subprojects were advanced in each city as examples that could form the basis of&#13;
10/    VAT has been excluded because VAT paid on capital assets is recaptured by the purchaser within six&#13;
months of the expenditure. In addition, imported equipment is now exempt from VAT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
other investments (see Annex 6-1). The total cost of this component is US$64.3 million, of which the&#13;
foreign exchange component is US$58 million (90 percent of the total) and the local costs are estimated&#13;
to be US$6.3 million (10 percent of the total). The total cost of the appraised sub-projects is US$19&#13;
million, of which the foreign exchange component is US$17 million (89 percent of the total) and the local&#13;
costs are US$2 million (11 percent of the total). Import duties (5 percent) apply to imported goods, and&#13;
VAT has been excluded from the estimates. It is proposed that the appraised projects identified would&#13;
be replicated in a number of cities. This approach would maximize the impact of the project and facilitate&#13;
implementation, while keeping costs low.&#13;
6.13  Technical Assistance: The estimated cost of the technical assistance components of the project&#13;
is US$15.5 million. Of this total, US$1.5 million, covering implementation assistance, is included in the&#13;
cost estimate for the system upgrading components of the project (para 6.24). Of the remaining US$14&#13;
million, an estimated US$2 million is the estimated cost of the twinning/training arrangement with an&#13;
international gas distribution company. An estimated US$2 million is proposed for technical support and&#13;
training of the RESF staff, while the remaining US$10 million will be used to finance the other&#13;
components of technical assistance outlined in paragraph 6.8.&#13;
6.14   Global Environment Facility: The total cost of the GEF component is US$3.7 million which&#13;
includes US$3.2 million provided by a global environment trust fund (GET) and US$0.5 million of&#13;
counterpart financing for services provided by local organizations to carry out field tests. Of the US$3.2&#13;
million GET grant, US$1.8 million will finance the investigation of GHG emissions from production and&#13;
transmission facilities, US$0.6 million will be allocated for studies relating to the gas distribution system&#13;
and US$0.8 million for the investigation and audit of energy efficiency investments. Further details are&#13;
provided in the GEF report No. P13076-RU. Table 6-1 indicates US$3.3 million as the total size of the&#13;
GEF component, as US$0.4 million has been allocated to finance a portion of leak detection equipment&#13;
of the asset preservation component.&#13;
D.    Financing Plan&#13;
6.15   The Bank loan to the Russian Federation will be in the amount of US$106.5 million, and will&#13;
cover the foreign currency component of the distribution system upgrading (US$36.5 million), the energy&#13;
efficiency investments (US$58 million), and the technical assistance components not covered by&#13;
co-financing (US$12 million). The loan will be on standard Bank terms with a maturity of 17 years,&#13;
including 5 years grace.&#13;
6.16   The proposed financing plan for the project is outlined in Table 6.2. Co-financing of US$1.5&#13;
million is being sought from various bilateral agencies to finance training for the GDC staff in the areas&#13;
of operations, finance and accounting, procurement and management. The training will be implemented&#13;
through a twinning arrangement with an international gas utility. Currently, the United Kingdom have&#13;
expressed a strong interest in twinning with Volgograd and have sent teams to work with the appraisal&#13;
mission to outline the program. The GEF will provide a US$3.2 million grant to develop an investment&#13;
program for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Volgograd Gorgas will finance US$13.4 million&#13;
equivalent from internal cash generation for local costs.&#13;
6.17   The funds for the gas distribution component will be onlent by the Russian Federation through&#13;
a subsidiary loan to Volgograd Gorgas. It is proposed that the government add 250 basis points to the&#13;
Bank's interest rate in onlending to the GDC to cover credit risks, cross currency risks, and&#13;
administrative costs incurred by the Government. Proposed terms for on-lending will be a maturity of&#13;
17 years, with 5 years grace to reflect the implementation period of the gas distribution component and&#13;
the cost recovery period for metering. Completion of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
the government and Volgograd Gorgas is a condition of loan effectiveness.&#13;

6.18   The funds for the proposed energy efficiency component will be onlent by the Government to&#13;
district heating and local power utilities, based on project review and appraisal carried out by the RESF.&#13;
Onlending for the sub-projects will be at 250 basis points above the Bank interest rate, with repayment&#13;
over 10 years, including 3 years grace. Subsidiary loan agreements will be established between the&#13;
government and the authorities who are financially responsible for energy efficiency investments. On-&#13;
lending will be in US dollars, with the beneficiaries carrying the ruble-US$ exchange rate risk and the&#13;
Government carrying the cross-currency risk. The Government has been asked to direct reflows accruing&#13;
from the differential loan terms to support energy efficiency investments. The Government has also&#13;
agreed to furnish the Subsidiary Loan Agreements for the energy efficiency subprojects for the Bank's&#13;
review prior to signing contracts under these components.&#13;
E.    Insurance&#13;
6.19   Insurance for goods and services to the point of delivery will be covered under the bids from&#13;
suppliers. Historically, insurance coverage for the assets and operations of the GDCs was provided&#13;
through budget transfers from the government. With privatization, risk has been effectively transferred&#13;
to the GDCs. Like most enterprises in the energy field, GDCs are relying on self insurance, although&#13;
there are no funds specifically set aside for this purpose. Instead, a portion of retained profits is set aside&#13;
in special funds for capital replacement and maintenance.&#13;
6.20   The potential to obtain insurance coverage against asset loss or liability is limited at the present&#13;
time. The Russian insurance industry is not well developed, and the more than 900 insurance firms are&#13;
generally small and inadequately capitalized. Only a few Russian insurance firms could potentially&#13;
provide coverage for the gas distribution systems, although they currently have limited experience in this&#13;
area. The cost of insurance coverage could range from 0.5 to 2.0 percent, depending on the state of the&#13;
facilities and the risks inherent in the operations. Premiums would likely tend on the higher end, given&#13;
the lack of experience and limited knowledge of the current state of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
6.21   The issue of asset and liability insurance was discussed with the GDC. It was agreed that the&#13;
GDC would continue to follow their current practice of retaining a portion of earnings as insurance&#13;
against loss and damages. When the new accounting legislation is implemented and the companies have&#13;
more discretion to set up special provisions, a portion of retained earnings will be transferred into an self-&#13;
insurance fund.&#13;
F.    Project Management and Implementation&#13;
6.22   The gas distribution system rehabilitation component of the project will be implemented over four&#13;
calendar years, starting in the third quarter of 1995 through the second quarter of 1999. All components&#13;
will be launched in the first year of the project. The proposed implementation schedule is shown in&#13;
Annex 6-4.&#13;
6.23   Gas Distribution Component: A project implementation team will be established in Volgograd&#13;
with staff possessing relevant qualifications. A project director will lead the team and will be supported&#13;
by a technical manager, a procurement manager, a finance manager and a logistics/administrative officer.&#13;
Considering the high educational level of the GDC senior staff and their understanding of the problems&#13;
faced by the companies, the preferred option will be to assign existing senior staff to the key positions,&#13;
with the chief engineer of the GDC taking the position of project director.&#13;
6.24   Considering the GDC's lack of experience with international and Bank procedures, especially with&#13;
regard to finance and procurement, it is proposed that consultant support services be provided. In&#13;
discussions with the GDC the following consultant skill mix is proposed:&#13;
(a)    Two consultants specializing in gas distribution will support the technical manager: the first, a&#13;
gas distribution specialist, with expertise in design and implementation of all aspects of gas distribution&#13;
networks will provide advice on project implementation and pipeline related designs. The other, with&#13;
expertise in metering design and specification, will be required in the early stages of the project.&#13;
(b)    A procurement specialist will advise the GDC in all aspects of the procurement process including&#13;
the preparation of tender documents, bid evaluations and contracts with suppliers of equipment and&#13;
services. The procurement specialist will also recommend institutional changes to strengthen the GDC's&#13;
capability to procure from local and international sources.&#13;
(c)    A financial analyst will assist the financial manager in establishing project accounting procedures,&#13;
in facilitating the preparation of financial statements that conform to international standards, and in&#13;
providing general financial advice to the GDC.&#13;
6.25   In view of the urgency, it is proposed that consultants be financed under the advance procurement&#13;
procedure. The cost for the specialists and support from their headquarters is estimated at US$1.5&#13;
million. The twinning arrangements proposed under the technical assistance component of the project&#13;
will complement the activities of the consultants. In view of the timing and the fact that the utilities&#13;
executing the twinning arrangements may also lack experience in Bank procedures, the twinning is not&#13;
seen, however, as a substitute for technical assistance.&#13;
6.26   Energy Efficiency Component: RESF will be responsible for evaluating, overseeing, and&#13;
administering onlending for the energy efficiency components of the project. During the first year, the&#13;
energy efficiency projects will be restricted to the four cities visited during appraisal plus St Petersburg.&#13;
In the following year, the geographic scope will be extended to include Nizhni-Novgorod, Samara,&#13;
Rostov-on-the-Don, Stavropol, and Vladimir. Pending the findings of a mid-term review, limits on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
geographic scope of the project could be lifted for the remaining years and for projects financed through&#13;
reflows. The responsibilities of RESF will include: (a) the review and approval of detailed sub-project&#13;
procurement needs (prepared by the district heating companies and local power plants); (b) review and&#13;
approval of the proposed execution of procurement activities, review of the economic and financial rates&#13;
of return and of the financial viability of the borrower; and (c) control and review of the technical and&#13;
financial aspects of sub-project implementation. Based on their review, the RESF staff will submit&#13;
qualifying sub-projects to a loan review committee, which will include the agency's board, supplemented&#13;
by representation from the Ministry of Finance. Initially, all projects will be submitted to the Bank for&#13;
final review and approval. It is expected, however, that once a base of experience has been developed,&#13;
the review committee will be authorized to approve projects requiring loans up to US$1 million. A&#13;
separate group will be established within the RESF to implement the energy efficiency component of the&#13;
project. During the initial phases of the project, RESF will be assisted in both project evaluation and&#13;
implementation by consultants to be financed under the institution strengthening component of technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
6.27   Two sources of financing will be made available under the project to assist RESF: (a) the spread&#13;
between the Bank lending rate and the onlending rate will include 0.5 percent to cover their administrative&#13;
costs; and, (b) part of the proposed GEF project on greenhouse gas reduction will be used to finance the&#13;
costs of establishing this unit. It is proposed that the debt servicing payments by the executing agencies&#13;
be made as two separate components - one of 0.5 percent to RESF and the other to the Government,&#13;
excluding the 0.5 percent spread designed to cover RESF's administrative costs. This will provide an&#13;
incentive for RESF to undertake an effective follow-up on repayments. The RESF will subrnit cash flow&#13;
and income statements on a quarterly basis, detailing how their income was spent. Ministry of Finance&#13;
will be responsible for managing repayment of the subsidiary loans, with the assistance of an agency&#13;
bank.&#13;
6.28   RESF and the Government have agreed that the primary criteria for the viability of sub-projects&#13;
will be: (a) an economic rate of return of not less than 20 percent (real); (b) a financial rate of return&#13;
of not less than 10 percent (real); (c) a demonstrated ability on the part of the ultimate borrower to&#13;
finance the local portion of project costs from internally generated funds; (d) the technical feasibility of&#13;
the proposal; (e) the proposed implementation plan; 09 a debt service ratio of at least 1.2 to demonstrate&#13;
the ability, on the part of the borrower, to repay the loan to the Ministry of Finance; and, (g) an&#13;
environmental assessment which meets Russian requirements.&#13;
G.    Procurement&#13;
6.29   Table 6.3 summarizes the procurement approaches to be used for the project. The equipment and&#13;
services to be financed by the Bank consist of standard, conventional items. The meters, SCADA system,&#13;
cathodic protection, leak detection equipment, software and hardware for network modeling, and pipes&#13;
are available from a number of suppliers world-wide and will be procured through international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) except for some small items of less than US$100,000 and emergency purchases&#13;
which will be procured under International Shopping (IS). The Bank's standard bidding documents will&#13;
be used for all ICB packages. Equipment purchased for energy efficiency investments will also be&#13;
procured under ICB except for equipment of small value (such as portable diagnostic equipment) which&#13;
will be procured under international shopping. Construction works and equipment installation will be&#13;
performed by local contractors, hired using Local Shopping, and financed by the GDC. At least three&#13;
quotations will be obtained from local contractors and the contract will be awarded to the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder. Works will be supervised jointly by local construction management teams and equipment supplier&#13;
representatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
6.30   The consultants to provide implementation assistance will be selected and managed by the GDC.&#13;
It is proposed that this take place under advance procurement procedures. The training and technical&#13;
assistance to RESF will be selected and managed by RESF. The upgrading of gas industry standards and&#13;
construction procedures will be selected and managed by Rossgazifikazia, but with MOFE as the&#13;
borrower. With the exception of the twinning arrangement, the remaining consultants will be selected&#13;
and managed by the Main Department for Gas Industry and Gasification within the MOFE. Co-&#13;
ordination will be undertaken by the consultant selected for that purpose. All consultants will be selected&#13;
in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants, with the exception of the consultants for&#13;
the Third Party Access Study and the coordination. MOFE has requested that the consultants hired for&#13;
the first phase of the Third Party Access Study be retained for the second phase (valued at $700,000) on&#13;
a sole source basis. The consultants have performed satisfactorily and the Bank has no objection to this&#13;
proposal. The coordination of the studies requires that consultants be hired that are familiar with all of&#13;
the issues involved in the proposed studies. A consortium of consulting companies has worked with&#13;
MOFE in defining this program and hence are uniquely qualified for this role. The Bank has reviewed&#13;
the proposed consultants qualifications and has no objection to the government's proposal that this&#13;
component, valued at $300,000, be sole sourced. In order to accelerate project implementation,&#13;
Volgograd Gorgas has requested, and the Bank has agreed, to select consultants, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
on a sole source basis, to assist the Gorgas in the initial stages of implementation. These consultants will&#13;
be employed during the first three to four months of project implementation, at which time it is expected&#13;
that the selection of long term consultants under competitive bidding procedures can be completed. The&#13;
twinning company will be selected and managed by the GDC from proposals received from the bilateral&#13;
donors. The GEF component will be implemented and managed by the committee set up for that&#13;
purpose.&#13;
6.31  Interested suppliers from Russia will be encouraged to bid on the ICB packages, particularly for&#13;
the cathodic protection equipment, meters and pipes. The bidding documents for ICB procurement will&#13;
include the Bank's standard preference for domestic manufacture of 15 percent or the value of the import&#13;
duties and taxes whichever is less, so that eligible and qualified Russian manufacturers can benefit from&#13;
the preference, should they bid. This will include Russian and international joint ventures that meet&#13;
domestic value requirements. Considering the separable nature of most of the project components (only&#13;
network modeling and pipe replacement are inter-dependent), procurement arrangements will be&#13;
structured so as to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate adjustments in the work program during&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
6.32   Procurement for the gas distribution component of the project will be handled by Volgograd&#13;
Gorgas. The GDC staff will be responsible for preparing and maintaining detail procurement plans.&#13;
These plans will contain a detailed list of bidding documents to be issued and a schedule for each&#13;
proposed contract, giving the date when the draft will be ready for Bank review, when bid documents&#13;
will be released, the bid opening date, the date the bid evaluation report will be given to the Bank for its&#13;
review, the contract signing date, and the dates when equipment will be delivered or services rendered.&#13;
Equipment procurement has been structured in a phased manner to minimize the financial risks for the&#13;
borrower. This is feasible because of the divisible nature of the project. Periodic reviews of the financial&#13;
viability of the project components and the GDC will be undertaken in close concert with procurement&#13;
reviews, to ensure that the project components remain feasible. The procurement plan would be adjusted&#13;
accordingly. Annex 6-4 shows the preliminary procurement plan for the project.&#13;

6.33   All contracts in excess of US$100,000 for the gas distribution component will be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review procedure. All of the energy efficiency contracts will be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review. This will result in over 90 percent of the total value of Bank financed goods being subject to&#13;
review. If, during project supervision, the Executing Agencies are found to be undertaking procurement&#13;
in a satisfactory manner, the review requirement will be modified to exclude contracts of less than&#13;
US$1.0 million. The terms of reference for all consulting assignments will be subject to prior review&#13;
by the Bank. All consulting services contracts in excess of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals will be subject to the Bank's prior review procedure. This relatively extensive review of the&#13;
procurement packages is considered necessary because of the inexperience of the implementing agencies.&#13;
In addition to the Bank's review procedure, a procurement specialist will assist the GDCs for at least the&#13;
first year when all the initial procurement packages will be prepared and issued. RESF staff will provide&#13;
procurement assistance to the entities responsible for energy efficiency investments. Selective post review&#13;
of awarded contracts below the threshold levels will be carried out on about one in four contracts.&#13;
H.    Disbursement&#13;
6.34   The profile of yearly expenditures for the Bank loan is given in Table 6-4. The distribution over&#13;
the implementation period (spread over four Bank fiscal years) is uneven, with 25 percent to be disbursed&#13;
in fiscal year 1996, 38 percent in 1997, 26 percent in 1998, and 11 percent in 1999. This distribution&#13;
is consistent with the borrowers' ability to implement the project as determined during appraisal. While&#13;
the profile is more compressed than is typical for Bank projects in the gas sector, it is defensible based&#13;
on the steps which have been taken to accelerate project implementation." In the first year, the&#13;
disbursements will be for consultants to assist the GDCs in project implementation and for the first round&#13;
of items to be procured under ICB. In the second and third years, the remaining portions of the&#13;
engineered materials and equipment will be disbursed.&#13;

the speed with which viable qualifying sub-projects are prepared, appraised, and approved. A number&#13;
11/    Draft tender documents for the items to be financed under the gas distribution component of the project&#13;
have been circulated to Volgograd Gorgas for their review. A draft Letter of Invitation to consultants to assist&#13;
in project implementation has also been completed.&#13;

payments in local currency, the Borrower would open separate Special Accounts (SAs) for each&#13;
component (Parts A, B and C of the Project) in a commercial bank or banks acceptable to IBRD.&#13;
The maximum authorized allocation of each of the SAs would be US$300,000. The initial amount to&#13;
be deposited at the beginning of disbursement would be US$100,000. This amount will be increased&#13;
to the maximum authorized allocation once the level of disbursement equals or exceeds US$1,000,000&#13;
equivalent in respect of each of the respective SAs. The SAs will be replenished at intervals as&#13;
required.&#13;

I.    Environment&#13;
6.38  In accordance with Annex E of OD 4.01 relating to rehabilitation and maintenance projects,&#13;
the proposed project has been assigned Category B classification. The project will not require any&#13;
land acquisition for new, permanent right-of-way, and will not require any population resettlement.&#13;
6.39   The natural gas savings generated by the energy efficiency component will provide both direct&#13;
and indirect environmental benefits. The direct effects include reduction in acid and greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions (NOx and CO2) associated with lower consumption of natural gas. The indirect benefits&#13;
stem from the greater availability of natural gas and its potential substitution for more polluting fuels&#13;
such as coal and petroleum products. As shown in Table 6-6, the direct environmental benefits of the&#13;
erergy efficiency component in terms of reduced acid and greenhouse gas emissions amount to 2,000&#13;
tonnes and 1.2 million tonnes each year, respectively. The magnitude of indirect benefits, while no&#13;
less real, depends on the rate of interfuel substitution and has not been estimated.&#13;
6.40   An environmental mitigation plan has been prepared to address the potential project impacts,&#13;
and is described in Annex 6-5. Only three components of the gas distribution system rehabilitation&#13;
may have a measurable impact on the physical environment: (a) replacement of degraded pipe; (b)&#13;
cathodic protection (including new test equipment); and, (c) new construction, maintenance, and&#13;
operating equipment. Though the impacts of cathodic protection and new equipment will be&#13;
cumulative and not site-dependent, pipe replacement impacts will be dependent on the specific&#13;
characteristics of the sites involved. Mitigative measures, including the training of an environmental&#13;
coordinator, are described in Annex 6-5.&#13;

J.    Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
6.41   Owing to the nature of the project, the relative lack of experience on Bank projects in Russia and&#13;
the lack of experience of Volgograd Gorgas and the RESF with Bank procedures, reporting arrangements&#13;
are particularly important. These conditions will require frequent adjustment of the work program to&#13;
compensate for changing conditions during project implementation. To facilitate increased focus on the&#13;
project objectives during implementation, a set of key development indicators that will be specifically&#13;
addressed during supervision missions and periodic reports by the borrower has been established (see&#13;
Annex 6-6).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
6.42   A project launch mission will take place early on to accelerate loan effectiveness and project&#13;
implementation. For the gas distribution component of the project, it is proposed that the Gorgas prepare&#13;
bi-monthly progress reports during the first year of implementation, then quarterly progress reports&#13;
thereafter. These reports will be furnished to the Bank and present the physical progress of the project,&#13;
procurement status, costs incurred and anticipated, disbursements made, administrative aspects and&#13;
institutional performance. A mid-term review will take place towards the end of the second year and the&#13;
Volgograd Gorgas will be required to prepare a report describing the physical progress and an assessment&#13;
of how well the project meets the overall project objectives and benefits. Because the project is broken&#13;
into a number of components, project supervision will require more resources than normal Bank projects.&#13;
Project supervision for the components to be implemented by Volgograd Gorgas will entail two&#13;
supervision missions annually. Requirements in terms of staff weeks are expected to be high (24 weeks)&#13;
in the first year, but will decline to 22 staff weeks in the second year, and to 20 in the third and fourth&#13;
years of the project. Supervision missions will also cover the energy efficiency components of the&#13;
project. Annex 6-7 details the proposed supervision program.&#13;
6.43   A significant monitoring and supervision effort is also planned for the energy efficiency&#13;
investment components of the project. Because of the number of sub-projects and enterprises involved&#13;
in the project, semi-annual missions are proposed during the first two years to monitor project progress.&#13;
The missions will include a technical specialist and a financial analyst specializing in energy-saving&#13;
projects. RESF, supported by the consultants providing institutional support to the group, will be&#13;
responsible for preparing documents for the Bank supervision missions. RESF will also be required to&#13;
submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports during project implementation, and to prepare and furnish&#13;
to the Bank, within six months of project completion, a completion report including a reassessment of&#13;
project costs and benefits.&#13;
6.44   During the implementation phase of the project, Volgograd Gorgas will furnish the following&#13;
financial reports to the Bank: (a) financial statements, within three months of the end of each fiscal year;&#13;
(b) audited project accounts, beginning with the account for fiscal year 1995, within six months of the&#13;
end of each fiscal year; (c) audited financial statements (including a qualified restatement in accordance&#13;
with GAAP, if required) showing their performance and position beginning with fiscal year 1995, within&#13;
six months of the end of each fiscal year; and, (d) by October 1 of every year, a copy of the budget for&#13;
the next financial year, clearly indicating how the financial targets can be met. The GDC will also&#13;
prepare and furnish to the Bank, within six months of project completion, a completion report including&#13;
a reassessment of project costs and benefits.&#13;
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A.    Projected Gas Demand&#13;
7.1    Projections of gas demand in Volgograd were based on a review of macro-economic and&#13;
demographic trends and the anticipated response of demand to the changing economic environment.12&#13;
The key assumptions in developing the projections are as follows:&#13;
*      Regional population growth will follow the growth factors projected for the country as&#13;
a whole. Changes in apartment stock will be directly linked to changes in population;&#13;
12/   In view of the considerable uncertainty as to the outcome of industrial restructuring, these projections&#13;
are regarded as general indicators at the city and regional levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
*     Efficiency of residential and commercial gas use will improve as old equipment is&#13;
replaced and prices approach full cost recovery;&#13;
*     The number of commercial establishments is correlated to changes in GDP. In addition,&#13;
there will be extraordinary growth in the number of commercial establishments by the&#13;
year 2010 in response to growth in consumer demand, adding 50 percent to GDP-driven&#13;
growth in establishments;&#13;
*     Changes in industrial gas consumption are directly correlated to projected changes in&#13;
national industrial output (excluding fuels). In addition, modest improvements in&#13;
efficiency were projected as a result of higher gas prices and modernization of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
*     The areas served by the district heating system in each city will not change. New&#13;
housing units would be served directly by gas or electricity. Modest improvements in&#13;
efficiency are also projected as a result of gas price increases and equipment replacement.&#13;
7.2    Figure 7-1 shows the projected gas demand for Volgograd Gorgas. After an overall decline in&#13;
demand of approximately 6 percent from 1992 to 1995, gas demand is projected to recover to 1992 levels&#13;
by the end of the decade. By the end of the forecast period (2010), gas demand is projected to be&#13;
approximately 21 percent higher than in 1992.&#13;

B.    Least-Cost Supply Analysis&#13;
7.3    An assessment was carried out of the long-run least cost means of providing space heating, hot&#13;
water and cooking services to new and existing residential and commercial customers and evaluated the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
economically prudent limit for district heating. The following conclusions were drawn:&#13;
District Heating vs. Direct Use of Gas in Apartment Blocks: Energy losses in district heating&#13;
rise in proportion to the distance of the consumer from the district heating plant. The economic&#13;
limits of supplying space heating and hot water through a district heating system were reviewed,&#13;
as opposed to on-site heaters and boilers. While there are many variables, it was concluded that&#13;
the economic limits of centralized supply were within a piping distance of approximately 7 km&#13;
from a combined heat and power plant. It is estimated, however, that 90 percent of the&#13;
apartments currently served by the district heating system in Volgograd are within this radius.&#13;
The relative economics of maintaining centralized, versus shifting to decentralized, boilers would&#13;
be reviewed as part of the assessment of district heating subprojects, if relevant (that is, where&#13;
system expansion or upgrading of outlying lines was involved).&#13;
*     Gas Service for Cooking Only: In the majority of apartment houses served by district heating,&#13;
gas is used only for cooking purposes, and a major part of the low-pressure distribution system&#13;
could be closed down if electric stoves were used instead of gas cookers. The long run marginal&#13;
cost (LRMC) of electricity for residential consumers has been estimated to be roughly US$&#13;
0.09/kWh (US$ 931/MCM equivalent). This may be less than the long-run cost of gas supply&#13;
for cooking only, particularly when the cost of increased capacity of the gas distribution system&#13;
is included. Given the low projected growth in demand, gas system capacity should be sufficient&#13;
to meet growth for some time. Hence, the marginal cost of gas would be limited to the short run&#13;
variable cost of supply. This would be lower than the cost of switching to electric cooking.&#13;
Therefore, continued support for gas use for cooking only is justifiable until the gas network is&#13;
due to be replaced, at which time cooking loads would be more cost effectively supplied by&#13;
electricity.&#13;
*     Efficiency of energy use in apartment buildings is extremely low and could be improved&#13;
considerably at relatively low cost. In general, efficiency improvements are a low-cost source&#13;
of incremental supply.&#13;
C.    Project Justification and Benefits&#13;
7.4    For the purpose of evaluating economic rates of return, the proposed project can be subdivided&#13;
into the following three main components:&#13;
(a)    installation and upgrading of meters;&#13;
(b)    investments in asset preservation and control; and,&#13;
(c)    energy efficiency investments for district heating and power plants.&#13;
7.5    Capital costs of the proposed project components were taken directly from the cost estimates&#13;
presented in Chapter 6, excluding taxes, duties, and contingencies. Financial costs were considered to&#13;
be a reasonable measure of the economic cost of resources used; and thus adjustments were not required.&#13;
Probable impacts of the project components on operating and maintenance costs were reviewed, and were&#13;
deemed on balance to be negligible. Although some aspects of the project would lead to higher&#13;
operations and maintenance costs, other aspects yielded corresponding savings.&#13;
7.6    The benefits of the metering and energy efficiency components of the project were measured in&#13;
terms of the value of gas savings. The benefits of the control and asset preservation component were&#13;
primarily based on deferred pipeline replacement. In addition, the reduction of stray currents from the&#13;
cathodic protection system would decrease the deterioration of other steel pipe systems, for example,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
district heating and water supply; however, these benefits were not quantified. Moreover, the project&#13;
would have important demonstration effects for cost-effective measures to improve the efficiency of end&#13;
use and of gas distribution in other cities in Russia. The economic returns are summarized in Table 7-1.&#13;
Subsequent paragraphs discuss the benefits analysis for each component, while Annex 7-1 presents the&#13;
detailed economic cash flow projections.&#13;

Investment costs (excluding         20.6          14.6          44.6        79.8&#13;
contingency) (in US$ million)&#13;
7.7    Metering: Most of the meters currently in place for industrial (and some commercial) customers&#13;
were installed many years ago, and as such, they are likely under-recording consumption. Upgrading&#13;
industrial meters would alleviate this problem, either reducing the nontechnical losses of Volgograd&#13;
Gorgas or encouraging the customer to reduce consumption. The associated savings were estimated at&#13;
2 percent of industrial gas consumption.&#13;
7.8    At present, most residential customers, as well as a number of commercial enterprises, are billed&#13;
based on consumption norms, which are computed estimates of average consumption derived from the&#13;
total quantity of gas supplied. There is consequently no incentive to conserve gas, because the marginal&#13;
cost of consumption by the consumer is zero. The installation of metering for apartment buildings,&#13;
private homes, and unmetered commercial customers would link consumers' gas bills directly to actual&#13;
consumption. This, together with projected rises in gas prices, is expected to induce customers to use&#13;
gas more efficiently. The gas savings arising from residential and commercial metering are estimated&#13;
by the consultant to be equivalent to 25% of current consumption.&#13;
7.9    The value of gas savings was based on the estimated long run marginal cost (LRMC) of gas&#13;
supply to industrial (US$40/MCM), commercial (US$140/MCM) and residential customers&#13;
(US$140/MCM). LRMC was used as a proxy for benefits, rather than export equivalents, because of&#13;
the uncertainties associated with increased exports. If export markets are limited, gas savings would&#13;
enable gas investments to be deferred. The value of such deferrals would be the LRMC of supply. The&#13;
LRMC estimates reflect the cost of supplying gas to the city gate, the variable costs of distribution, and&#13;
the need for rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution network in each city. In most instances,&#13;
however, neither rehabilitation nor system expansion are a significant factor because of contracting&#13;
demand. Thus, operations and maintenance constitute the major part of the marginal costs over and&#13;
above the cost at the city gate under the current situation. The LRMC of supplying gas for cooking only&#13;
is estimated to be US$250/MCM, which is largely attributable to fixed customer service costs. However,&#13;
the value of potential gas savings associated with these customers is lower, and the benefits were valued&#13;
at the US$140/MCM level.&#13;
7.10   Upgrading of industrial meters shows the lowest rate of return at 10 percent, because the savings&#13;
are limited to more accurate readings. The introduction of meters for commercial and residential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
customers shows an economic rate of at least 55 percent. Of these, the introduction of meters in&#13;
apartment blocks has the lowest rate of return (55 percent) because of the low gas consumption (cooking&#13;
only) and consequently small gas savings. However, the rate of return on the installation of meters for&#13;
commercial enterprises and private households are 459 percent and 140 percent, respectively.&#13;
7.11   Asset Preservation and Controls: In addition to meters, the gas distribution component of the&#13;
project includes cathodic protection, SCADA, leak detection equipment, inspection and testing equipment,&#13;
and network analysis tools. Each component provides a contribution to improve the long-run reliability,&#13;
safety, and economic and technical efficiency of the gas distribution system. The project benefits of these&#13;
components are evaluated as a package for preservation, control, and supervision of the entire distribution&#13;
system. Several components of the package contribute to the benefit. However, cathodic protection,&#13;
which represents the major share of the cost of the asset preservation and control component (57 percent),&#13;
also provides the main contribution to the economic benefits through the extension of the expected life&#13;
of pipelines, resulting in deferred pipeline replacement and reduced maintenance, and a reduction in&#13;
electricity consumption.&#13;
7.12   The value of the economic benefits is estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)    Deferred or avoided pipeline replacement is calculated as the opportunity cost of reduced annual&#13;
pipeline-replacement costs, because of an extension of the lifetime of the network from an&#13;
estimated 20 years to 60 years. The introduction of the SCADA system and network analysis&#13;
would reduce operational and maintenance costs. The effects of these components are estimated&#13;
to add 10 percent to the benefits of deferred pipeline replacement. The replacement cost of the&#13;
buried pipeline system is estimated at US$114 per meter (see Annex 7-1 for details).&#13;
(b)    The benefit associated with reduced electrical consumption by the cathodic protection system is&#13;
valued at the economic costs of electricity for industrial consumption: US$0.065/kWh.&#13;
7.13   Energy Efficiency Investments: The primary potential energy efficiency investments in district&#13;
heating and combined heat and power plants are burner and boiler replacement, meters and control&#13;
equipment, and instrumentation to improve oxygen trim. Considerable efficiency gain can also be&#13;
accomplished through better combustion design, modifications to permit operation as a closed system,&#13;
and controls and operating procedures in district heating plants. A number of subprojects, with a total&#13;
estimated cost of approximately US$42 million (at 1993 price levels), have been identified in the four&#13;
cities. The associated benefits of these subprojects have also been estimated in terms of projected annual&#13;
gas savings. Using a cost of US$40/MCM (that is, the LRMC of industrial and commercial consumption)&#13;
to measure the value of these benefits yields an average economic internal rate of return of 25 percent&#13;
on the identified subprojects. The project is structured, however, to allow a measure of flexibility in the&#13;
selection of subprojects, provided that they yield an economic rate of return of 20 percent or more. In&#13;
addition, by expanding the geographic scope of the project to encompass additional cities (see para 6.26),&#13;
it should be possible to replicate those projects at the higher end of the range of EIRRs, thereby&#13;
increasing both the quantities of gas saved and the average EIRR on the energy efficiency component.&#13;
In summary, the package of subprojects ultimately implemented could provide an average rate of return&#13;
that is greater than the 25 percent estimated above, but not less than the 20 percent minimum.&#13;
D.    Economnic Sensitivity Analyses&#13;
7.14   Based on the assumptions specified above, the economic rate of return of the project as a whole&#13;
is 38 percent. The following analysis shows the sensitivity of the EIRR to the underlying assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
7.15   Project Cost: The cost of the investment program may prove to be higher than estimated by the&#13;
consultant. A 15 percent increase in project costs would reduce the economic rate of return to 36&#13;
percent.&#13;
7.16   Environmental Benefits: Environmental benefits of the project would result from a reduction in&#13;
the use of gas and methane leakage in the network. Reduction in gas consumption would reduce the&#13;
emissions of CO2, SO2, NO, and particulates. The reduction of CO2 emissions is valued at US$20/t of&#13;
CO2 emitted. If these environmental benefits are included, the economic rate of return would rise to 62&#13;
percent.&#13;
7.17   Exports and the Economic Value of Natural Gas: Gas savings in the industrial sector are valued&#13;
at US$40/MCM, and in the commercial and residential sectors at US$140/MCM. These are conservative&#13;
estimates of the value of gas saved, which reflect the marginal cost of supply in domestic markets (see&#13;
para 7.9). The medium- and long-term prospects for increased gas exports from Russia to Europe is&#13;
expected to rise (see para 3.3). At the time of project appraisal, negotiations of gas prices among&#13;
importers of gas in Western Europe and major exporters had settled at around US$80/MCM at the&#13;
importing country's border (at Waidhaus in the Czech Republic). This would result in a netback of&#13;
US$60/MCM at the Russian/Ukrainian border, or US$55/MCM at the city gate. If in the economic&#13;
analysis the opportunity cost of gas consumed by industrial, commercial and residential customers were&#13;
taken as equivalent, at the city gate, to this export-linked value, the benefits associated with gas savings&#13;
would rise to US$60/MCM for industrial consumption, and US$160/MCM for residential and commercial&#13;
consumption. At these values, the economic rate of return would rise to 48 percent.&#13;
VIII. FINANCIAL EVALUATION AND RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Projected Profitability and Rate of Return&#13;
8.1    Financial returns on the project, like the investments themselves, will be spread among a number&#13;
of beneficiaries. For Volgograd Gorgas, returns will accrue through decreases in unbilled supplies as&#13;
a result of improved and extended metering and through reduced or deferred asset replacement as a result&#13;
of network improvements. The associated capital costs incurred by the Gorgas are discussed in Chapter&#13;
VI, and include the costs of meters and meter-testing equipment, cathodic protection, network analysis&#13;
tools and related asset maintenance equipment. Retail prices of gas were assumed to increase in real&#13;
terms, reaching US$40/MCM equivalent (excluding VAT) by the end of 1995 for industrial and&#13;
commercial customers and reaching US$40/MCM by the end of 1997 for residential customers. Margins&#13;
were assuned to remain constant in percentage terms. '3&#13;
8.2    The overall financial rate of return to Volgograd Gorgas is 17.1 percent. Table 8-1 below shows&#13;
the rates of return separately for the metering and network improvement components of the project and&#13;
for the two components jointly. Details of the rate-of-return calculations are provided in Annex 8-1.&#13;
8.3    Clearly, the metering component of the project is not financially viable from the perspective of&#13;
13/    Margin refers to the difference between the price at which the GDC buys the gas from Gazprom and the&#13;
price at which it sells to its customers. Projected margins are based on a constant percentage spread between&#13;
purchase and selling prices. Because the margins must cover operating costs, interest, taxes, and return on assets&#13;
employed, it is the margin, rather than the absolute selling price of the gas, that determines financial profitability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
the Gorgas under the base assumptions with regard to prices. Although the potential economic benefits&#13;
are substantial in terms of induced conservation and consequent freeing up of gas for export, financial&#13;
returns to the gas distribution company, which are limited to reductions in unbilled supplies, are&#13;
insufficient to support the investment required. Possible approaches to resolving this problem include:&#13;
(a) recovering part and/or all of the meter costs through direct customer contributions; or (b) imposing&#13;
a demand charge on metered customers to recover the capital costs of the meters (including a return on&#13;
investment) over their economic life.&#13;
Table 8-1&#13;
Financial Rate of Retum on Components&#13;

Improvements&#13;
Volgograd           -12.3%                  34.9%                  17.1%&#13;
8.4    Under the first alternative, up-front customer contributions would have to cover a substantial&#13;
proportion of meter capital costs. To allow Volgograd Gorgas to achieve a minimum 10 percent FIRR&#13;
on the metering component of the project, customers would have to contribute 92 percent of meter capital&#13;
costs. Given the high unit costs for meters relative to income, an attempt to finance the meters through&#13;
up-front customer contributions is likely to be constrained by customer ability to pay. In addition,&#13;
substantial customer contributions could create uncertainties or disputes with regard to meter ownership&#13;
and, hence, maintenance.&#13;
8.5    Under the second alternative, Volgograd Gorgas would impose a demand charge or meter rental&#13;
charge that would recover the financial cost of the meters (including a 10 percent return on investment)&#13;
over a more extended period. Recovering the full cost of the meters over 10 years would require&#13;
monthly demand charges in the order of US$0.70 for apartment units, US$11.40 for commercial&#13;
customers, and US$230 for industrial users. If the Gorgas were to recover only those percentages of&#13;
meter cost required to yield an overall 10 percent return on the investment, demand charges would be&#13;
reduced accordingly.&#13;
8.6    The option of applying a meter rental charge was discussed with Volgograd Gorgas during&#13;
appraisal and was generally well received. The Gorgas management expressed some concern about&#13;
householders' ability, and incentive, to pay a meter rental charge given current economic conditions and&#13;
the extremely low cost of residential gas. However, given that the installation of residential meters is&#13;
generally concentrated in the later years of the project, by which time it is expected that both household&#13;
incomes and residential gas prices will have increased in real terms, the barriers associated with&#13;
affordability and incentive should no longer be an issue.&#13;
8.7    Assuming that rental charges are set to recover the full cost of meters and installation over a 10&#13;
year period, the FIRR on the metering component of the project would increase to 19.2 percent, and the&#13;
FIRR on the project as a whole would increase to 26.2 percent. Table 8-2 sunmmarizes the results by&#13;
component.&#13;
8.8    For the energy efficiency components of the project (those funds that would be directed towards&#13;
energy efficiency investments by local district heating and power utilities), positive projected financial&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
returns would be a condition of access to funds through the RESF. Returns cannot be defined until such&#13;
time as specific projects are fully evaluated and agreed to. The economic analysis, however, has&#13;
demonstrated that there are a number of potential efficiency initiatives with substantial returns. In turn,&#13;
RESF's activities would be financially self-sustaining, with the margin between borrowing and lending&#13;
costs set to recover their operating and administration costs.&#13;

B.    Financial Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
8.9    The major uncertainties about the financial profitability and rate of return on the project relate&#13;
to the distribution system rehabilitation components to be implemented by Volgograd Gorgas.&#13;
Uncertainty regarding the capital costs is a concern given the escalation in prices of local materials and&#13;
labor, and the ongoing shifts in the exchange rate. The financial analysis examined the impact of an&#13;
overall 15 percent real increase in the cost of project inputs. This increase would reduce the financial&#13;
rate of return on the network improvement components from 34.9 percent to 31.2 percent. At the same&#13;
time, however, changes in input costs would have an impact on the benefits of the network improvement&#13;
components of the project, which accrue from deferred asset replacement. If this associated impact of&#13;
a 15 percent cost increase is included in the analysis, the FIRR on the network improvements component&#13;
of the project would be unchanged at 34.9 percent. Because meter rental charges would be adjusted to&#13;
reflect actual capital costs incurred, higher capital costs would have only a minor impact on the FIRR of&#13;
the metering component.&#13;
8.10   There is also uncertainty about the benefits of the asset life extension program. The base case&#13;
analysis presumes that under the project the asset replacement period will increase from an average of&#13;
20 years to 60 years. Given the uncertainty about the existing condition of the pipe network, these&#13;
assumptions may overstate the benefits. Assuming instead that the average asset life is increased from&#13;
20 to 40 years, the FIRR on the network improvement components of the project declines from 34.9&#13;
to 28.2 percent, and the overall FIRR on the project would decline from 26.2 to 22.2 percent.&#13;
C.    Risk Analysis and Management&#13;
8.11   Background: Project risks were assessed to determine a risk mitigation strategy. The analysis&#13;
focused on financial risks instead of economic risks because of the relatively high project returns in&#13;
economic terms. Furthermore, as GDCs have become joint stock companies, support to their increasing&#13;
financial focus is important. The process involved establishing a list of project risks, followed by the&#13;
development of alternative risk mitigation strategies. The impact of the proposed mitigative measures&#13;
were evaluated to determine the incremental impact on expected financial returns for the project; thus,&#13;
a risk mitigation plan for the project could be developed. The approach is designed to increase the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
expected project returns by developing a risk mitigation strategy in advance of project implementation.&#13;
This strategy would be adhered to during project implementation to manage risks.&#13;
8.12   Risk List: The uncertainty associated with the project's financial&#13;
returns, without risk mitigation, was analyzed using a monte carlo                 Risk List&#13;
simulation. Uncertainties associated with project costs (quantities and unit&#13;
costs) and benefits (quantities and values) were evaluated by assigning a      Equipment Quantity&#13;
probability distribution to each element and linking inherent dependencies.   Equipment UntCts&#13;
The results of the analysis of the project financial returns (for the asset life  Equipment Unit Costs&#13;
extension component) without risk mitigation indicated that the expected          Output Prices&#13;
FIRR would decrease by 2.7 percent compared to the most likely case.'4           Energy Savings&#13;
Furthermore, the risk analysis also  indicated that the uncertainties            Investment Plan&#13;
associated with costs justify the relatively high level of physical&#13;
contingencies.&#13;
8.13   Risk Mitigation: After the uncertainties were analyzed, a risk mitigation list was developed.&#13;
The risk mitigation proposals form the basis of a strategy in which risks could be controlled, thus&#13;
lowering the likelihood of decreased project returns. Many of these risk mitigation strategies have been&#13;
built into the project design concept, including: (a) conditioning the loan on establishing joint stock&#13;
companies; (b) establishing a twinning/training relationship to foster the transition to a privately owned&#13;
entity; and, (c) establishing a suitable skill mix within Volgograd Gorgas and providing outside support.&#13;
In addition, risk management would be actively controlled during project implementation, in particular,&#13;
during the procurement process. Three explicit controls would be enforced (see Annex 8-2 for details):&#13;
(a) actively promoting bids from Russian suppliers; (b) decreasing local costs by increasing productivity;&#13;
and, (c) critically reviewing bids to decrease the likelihood of low probability, high-cost purchases.&#13;
8.14   Encouraging participation of Russian manufacturers in the&#13;
Risk Mitigation List    bidding process is being pursued by the GDCs, Rossgazifikazia and the&#13;
Bank.  Seminars are held in Moscow  to explain Bank procurement&#13;
Price Reform         requirements. In the cases where equipment is unsatisfactory, Russian&#13;
Institutional Reform    suppliers are being encouraged to either license the designs of others or&#13;
instiTutionalReog      establish joint venture partnerships.   Foreign  manufacturers are&#13;
Training/Twinning      encouraged  to invest in domestic manufacturing  recognizing  the&#13;
Phased Procurement      considerable unmet market potential.&#13;
Financial Covenants&#13;
Gas Market Analysis     8.15   Control of the local costs are addressed through the twinning&#13;
Procurement Review      component, by establishing new procedures that are enabled as a result&#13;
of equipment investments (freeing up staff) and by training staff to&#13;
undertake new tasks or carry out existing tasks more efficiently. The&#13;
low probability/high equipment cost scenarios would be controlled by a proactive bid evaluation process.&#13;
If bids prices exceed experience on prices for similar equipment proposed elsewhere, the process will be&#13;
reviewed and mitigative measures will be adopted (including re-bidding or, possibly, dropping&#13;
components from the project). As a result of the proposed risk control strategy, the expected returns&#13;
would increase by 1.7 percent for the asset life extension component and by 3.7 percent for the metering&#13;
component. The risk mitigation plan is detailed in Annex 8-2.&#13;
14/    The expected return is less than the most likely return because the uncertainties are negatively skewed,&#13;
that is, the probability of downside risk exceeds the probability of upside risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
D.    Cash Flow and Financing Considerations&#13;
8.16   The ability of Volgograd Gorgas to meet its financial obligations under the project is contingent&#13;
on continued increases in internal cash generation as compared with past performance, the re-investment&#13;
of earnings to fund local portions of investment needs, and the maintenance of a cash-flow position to&#13;
meet debt service obligations.&#13;
8.17   It is proposed that the Gorgas would provide funding to cover all local expenditures. Given the&#13;
limited availability of local debt financing, these local components of the investment program would have&#13;
to be funded from internal sources. Meeting this requirement would necessitate ongoing increases in the&#13;
real levels of gas prices over the next 2 to 3 years (to approximately US$40/MCM equivalent), as well&#13;
as the retention of a significant portion of earnings surpluses over the period of investment. Real prices&#13;
of gas to industrial and commercial customers have increased substantially from mid-1993 (see para 3.18)&#13;
from US$8.80/MCM to an estimated US$24.19/MCM. In addition, on March 1, 1995, a resolution was&#13;
adopted to increase the residential gas price to RR 20,000/MCM (RR 16,260 excluding VAT and special&#13;
tax, or approximately US$3.70 at the current exchange rate), which more than doubled the real price&#13;
relative to the level at the time of the last price adjustment (see Table 3-2).  At the same time,&#13;
responsibility for setting residential gas prices was devolved to the regional administration who, as&#13;
guarantor of the subsidiary loan to Volgograd Gorgas, will have an ongoing commitment to maintain&#13;
prices at compensatory levels.&#13;
8.18   Analysis of the projected financial performance of Volgograd Gorgas indicates that the&#13;
combination of ongoing real increases in industrial/commercial gas prices, constant real residential gas&#13;
prices, meter rental charges (calculated based on a 10 year recovery and 10 percent rate of return), and&#13;
retention of surpluses would be more than sufficient to provide the internally generated funds necessary&#13;
to meet the local currency components of the projects, over the envisioned time frame for implementation&#13;
(see Annex 8-3). Over the longer term, cash flow is sufficient to meet debt service obligations and to&#13;
provide an average return on net revalued assets over the period 1998 to 2002  of approximately 20&#13;
percent. 5&#13;
8.19   Although the income and cash flow projections suggest that Volgograd Gorgas will be able to&#13;
satisfactorily meet the financial obligations associated with implementing the project, two provisions in&#13;
this regard should be noted. First, the analysis presumes that the company is able to maintain arrears&#13;
at not more than their December 1993 levels relative to sales. The experience of other Gorgases suggests&#13;
that this is feasible, and Volgograd has demonstrated a willingness to pursue the issue.&#13;
8.20   Second, the analysis grants first priority in retained earnings to the project under consideration.&#13;
Distribution of surpluses to employees and investments in other capital equipment are not included. The&#13;
projections indicate, however, that there is a significant surplus available in Volgograd Gorgas, after&#13;
meeting the commitments of the project. These residual funds would be available to meet other financing&#13;
needs and to be distributed to shareholders.&#13;
15/    The relatively high return on assets is attributable in large measure to the following: (a) the value of&#13;
the assets, which is based on historic Russian costs adjusted for inflation, is generally felt to be understated&#13;
owing to prior distortions in domestic prices; and, (b) many of the assets were put in place many years ago and&#13;
are largely depreciated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
E.    Financial Covenants&#13;
8.21   Proposed covenants are designed with three main objectives:  (a) ensuring that sufficient&#13;
counterpart funds are generated from revenues to cover operating costs and all of the local components&#13;
of the investment program; (b) ensuring that debt can be fully serviced with a reasonable margin; and&#13;
(c) providing returns that are sufficient to attract equity participation by the private sector.&#13;
8.22   A self-financing covenant would require the utility to demonstrate that they can finance the local&#13;
portion of the projects from internally generatedfunds. Local costs vary from year to year. On average,&#13;
local costs are 27 percent of total expenditures for Volgograd Gorgas, but during the first year of the&#13;
project, local costs are in the order of 20 percent of the total. In view of the Gorgas's need to build up&#13;
retained earnings, the self-financing requirement has been set at 20 percent for the first year of the project&#13;
(1996), rising to 30 percent for subsequent years. By the end of October of each calendar year,&#13;
Volgograd Gorgas would prepare, for the Bank's review and approval, cash flow analyses based on the&#13;
projected subsequent years 'prices, performance and investment program to demonstrate compliance with&#13;
this covenant.&#13;
8.23   An accounts receivable covenant is included in the loan agreement requiring Volgograd Gorgas&#13;
to maintain accounts receivable balances on trade accounts at less than or equal to the value of the&#13;
previous three months sales.&#13;
8.24   Once capital outlays are completed, the Gorgas would be required to earn an annual return on&#13;
net revalued fixed assets of 10 percent. This would allow a reasonable return to investors and ensure&#13;
ongoing access to equity capital. The company would also be required to demonstrate adequate debt&#13;
service coverage. Because leverage would be low, a debt-service coverage covenant of 1.5 is included&#13;
to ensure that there are adequate funds available to meet loan repayment requirements.&#13;
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
9.1    During negotiations, the following agreements were reached. The Government agreed to: (i)&#13;
undertake a study that would address ways of improving the regulatory framework for the gas sector to&#13;
implement the Government's policies, particularly with regard to pricing and efficiency of supply, and,&#13;
(ii) prepare a satisfactory action plan to effect these improvements (see para 3.26)&#13;
9.2 The Government and Volgograd Gorgas agreed to the proposed financial covenants (a self-&#13;
financing ratio of at least 20 percent in the first year and at least 30 percent thereafter, a debt service ratio&#13;
of at least 1.5, accounts receivable not more than three months sales equivalent and a return on net&#13;
revalued fixed assets of no less than 10 percent). (see para 8.22, 8.23 and 8.24)&#13;
9.3 The Government and RESF agreed that the primary criteria for the viability of energy efficiency&#13;
sub-projects would be: (a) an economic rate of return of not less than 20 percent (real); (b) a financial&#13;
rate of return of not less than 10 percent (real); (c) a demonstrated ability on the part of the ultimate&#13;
borrower to finance the local portion of project costs from internally generated funds; (d) the technical&#13;
feasibility of the proposal; (e) a satisfactory implementation plan; (f) a debt service ratio of at least 1.2&#13;
to demonstrate the ability, on the part of the borrower, to repay the loan to the Ministry of Finance; and,&#13;
(g) an environmental assessment which meets Russian requirements. (see para 6.28)&#13;
9.4 Volgograd Gorgas agreed to furnish, by the end of October of each calendar year, a copy of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
cash flow analyses based on the prices, performance and investment program that demonstrate its ability&#13;
to meet the self-financing ratio covenant. (see para 8.22)&#13;
Actions to be Taken&#13;
9.5 The government would complete a subsidiary loan agreements with Volgograd Gorgas as a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness. (see para 6.17)&#13;
9.6 Tendering for items where all or part of the acquisition could be deferred (for example, meters)&#13;
would be structured to allow phased procurement. This would enable a close linkage to be maintained&#13;
between compliance on financial issues and equipment procurement. (see para 6.32)&#13;
9.7  Finally, as part of its obligations under the financial covenants attached to the loan agreement, it&#13;
will be necessary for the government to monitor the actions of the municipal and regional governments&#13;
and agencies in the project areas to ensure that they do not take independent actions that would prejudice&#13;
the ability of the subsidiary borrowers to meet their financial obligations under the loan. (see para 5.29)&#13;

RUSSLAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
Russia's Gas Balance&#13;
Assumptions: Demand for Russian gas has been volatile over the recent past as a result of: the&#13;
economic reforms in Central Europe reducing energy demand; the economic slowdown of the early 1990s&#13;
in Western Europe; and, more recently, the breakup of the Former Soviet Union and the reforms which&#13;
have taken place there. These events have all led to a lower than expected consumption of Russian&#13;
produced gas. However, there have been recent signs of a turnaround in some of these markets.&#13;
Economic growth has accelerated in Western Europe. The reforms in some of the countries in Central&#13;
Europe are showing signs of success with a turnaround in economic growth. The economies of many&#13;
of the FSU republics lag those of Central Europe, as their reform programs have been slower in getting&#13;
started. For some economies (like Russia) this is expected to result in a similar turnaround in a few years&#13;
time. However, for some economies (like Ukraine) the delay in economic turnaround is assumed to take&#13;
longer.&#13;
Impact on Gas Demand: As a result of the above scenarios, gas demand in Western Europe&#13;
is expected to accelerate in the near- to medium-term as gas is expected to be the fuel of choice due to&#13;
cost and environmental considerations. The forecast assumes that Western Europe demand will grow at&#13;
about 3 percent per annum, reflecting modest economic growth and no policy shifts in energy use (in&#13;
particular, that a carbon tax is not introduced which would make gas a relatively more attractive fuel).&#13;
This forecast is generally consistent with those made by consultants outside the Bank. Demand for gas&#13;
in Central Europe is assumed to grow at about 4 percent per annum, on the basis that these economies&#13;
will grow faster during their period of economic recovery.&#13;
Demand in the FSU is assumed to respond in a manner similar to Centrai Europe. In the few&#13;
fast reforming economies, gas demand is expected to grow quickly after the shock of price increases have&#13;
been absorbed. In the case of Russia, demand is expected to drop quickly as bankrupt companies are&#13;
closed. This is expected to be followed by further decreases due to a change in the structure of the&#13;
economy and energy efficiency investments. The decreases in consumption are expected to continue until&#13;
1998 when demand is expected to grow again. For Russia's major export markets in the FSU, Ukraine&#13;
and Belarus, gas demand is assumed to drop until 1997, after which it is assumed to remain constant.&#13;
This does not reflect expected demand as much as it reflects the uncertainty with reform programs in&#13;
these two markets. The level assumed that demand contracts to a level that would be politically&#13;
acceptable.&#13;
Gas Production: Gas production in Russia is assumed to be a function of the size of the&#13;
available resources and Gazprom's ability to mobilize these resources. The production shown in the&#13;
attached table is a theoretical production level based on the utilization of existing fields and step-outs from&#13;
those fields. Hence, the potential surplus refers to the additional gas that could be supplied from existing&#13;
fields and step-outs if the demand necessitated it. The development of Yamal is nIot included as potential&#13;
production as it would not be a marginal resource. The size of the field is considerable, but the expected&#13;
cost of delivering gas to market from Yamal is expected to be about 50 percent greater than for existing&#13;
fields. Developing this resource would require considerable increases in gas prices which would, in turn,&#13;
invoke a demand response. Given the assumed level of demand for Russian gas, there does not appear&#13;
to be a need to develop Yamal in the near term.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
GAS PRICING IN RUSSIA&#13;
Market Framework&#13;
1.    The principle upon which gas pricing recommendations are based is its market value. To&#13;
establish this, some understanding of the market for Russia gas production is necessary. Briefly, its&#13;
export markets to western Europe are about 60 BCM/year. This is forecast to grow at about 3% p.a.&#13;
Over the long term energy consumption in central Europe is still being rationalized, and demand has&#13;
generally been dropping with some notable exceptions -- gas demand has increased in Poland, Hungary&#13;
and the Czech Republic in 1993. Thus gas exports to central Europe are expected to remain constant&#13;
over the near term (as some countries pull out of their recession and growth starts), followed by a strong&#13;
increase in demand growth (to about 5% p.a.). Russian gas is expected to capture much of this&#13;
incremental demand as it is the least cost fuel for many markets. Exports to the FSU (particularly&#13;
Ukraine) are expected to contract considerably as prices increase and the structure of the economies&#13;
evolve.&#13;
2.    Russian demand is also expected to contract considerably, largely as a result of three phenomena:&#13;
(i) shutting down uneconomic plants and scaling back production due to market contraction; (ii) energy&#13;
conservation in industries that survive; and (iii) a change in the structure in the economy (away from&#13;
heavy industry and toward light industry and services) resulting in new investments using technologies&#13;
that are energy efficient.&#13;
Pricing Principles&#13;
3.    Industrial Sector (all but households): The reduction in gas consumption has resulted in a&#13;
situation in which gas is demand constrained. In a liberalized energy market, in which independent gas&#13;
producers would compete for market share, gas supply would compete for market share with gas from&#13;
other sources (rather than petroleum products). Under such a scenario, gas prices would approach the&#13;
cost of supply (as has been the case in United States) rather than petroleum product equivalents. Over&#13;
the near term, the short run marginal cost of supply would reflect maintenance investments (as expansion&#13;
needs are expected to be limited over the near- to medium-term) in the existing system, resulting in a low&#13;
marginal cost of supply.&#13;
4.    As gas companies in the FSU are privatized, the financial cost of supply has become the primary&#13;
consideration in price setting. These utilities need prices to be set at sufficient levels to enable them to&#13;
cover their operating and maintenance costs and most of their investment costs due to the linited access&#13;
to capital. To establish the appropriate pricing signals (to provide an incentive for energy efficiency&#13;
investments and to enable new investments in downstream sectors to be based on an economically&#13;
efficient mix of labor, capital and energy), gas prices should reflect the full cost of supply (based on a&#13;
reasonable rate of return on revalued assets). It is important that prices are not simply increased to this&#13;
level, as this could result in generating excess cash for gas utilities, which would likely result in&#13;
(unearned) dividends to the shareholders (resulting in an undesirable transfer of wealth from gas&#13;
consumers to gas company employees). Given that the Government budget was the source of financing&#13;
for these investments, it is appropriate that the returns on these investments should be directed to the&#13;
Government. This can be accomplished by anyone of a number of financial instruments including by&#13;
imposing an excise tax which will enable the Government to receive a return on its equity and thus help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
Annex 3-3&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
mitigate the fiscal deficit problem. This tax should be an interim measure that is gradually replaced by&#13;
corporate taxes as gas utilities start to replace the Government as the investor in the system's assets. Gas&#13;
prices would need to be increased to enable the gas utilities to finance part of their investments from&#13;
internally generated funds and to service a growing debt load. By taking Govermnent rent through&#13;
corporate taxes, incentives would also be established for corporate entities in the gas sector to improve&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
5.     In addition, gas should be sold at the "city gate" (or plant gate) at a price that reflects the cost&#13;
of extraction and delivery, and hence should be differentiated by region. Prices should also reflect the&#13;
seasonal variations in the cost of supply, explicitly valuing storage costs. (Gas supply during the winter&#13;
months is currently constrained by inadequate storage. Storage facilities need to be mobilized to enable&#13;
gas to capture more of the current market currently serviced by petroleum products.&#13;
6.     Using typical international gas equipment costs as a proxy to value Russia's gas system assets (as&#13;
the current book costs suffer numerous distortions), it has been estimated that the cost of supply to the&#13;
city gate in the Moscow region is about US$30 to US$35/MCM. Incremental supply costs to industries&#13;
in Russia have been much lower than other countries because the customer carries much of the&#13;
incremental investment costs. Hence, the total supply cost to industrial customers in the Moscow region&#13;
is estimated to be about US$35-US$40/MCM. Gas prices as of April 1995 are about 60-70 percent of&#13;
this target.&#13;
7.     Sales to Households: Gas prices for households would have to be increased by about 20-fold&#13;
(over the March 1995 levels) to reflect the full (replacement) cost of supply. However, since much of&#13;
the asset base is fully amortized and maintenance costs are low, March 1995 prices are estimated to cover&#13;
about 10% of the current cost of supply. With current income levels, increasing gas prices to fully&#13;
recover costs is clearly not feasible, since utility costs would exceed many households total income. This&#13;
problem can be addressed in one of three ways: (i) gas prices to households can be increased gradually,&#13;
while the difference between the financial cost of supply and the price charged to households is covered&#13;
by cross-subsidies from industrial consumption; (ii) gas prices to households could be increased gradually&#13;
as in (i), while the difference between the cost of supply and the price charged is explicitly identified and&#13;
financed from a Government budget transfer; or, (iii) gas prices could be increased to reflect the full cost&#13;
of supply and the customers would receive a cash transfer from the Government through a social safety&#13;
net to help pay for this increased cost.&#13;
8.     The advantage of the first option is that it is easy to implement and has a low administrative cost.&#13;
The disadvantage is that the incentive for households to conserve energy is relatively low, and that the&#13;
existing price distortion is addressed by introducing another price distortion. When this approach has&#13;
been used elsewhere, these distortions are usually retained for a longer period of time than is desirable.&#13;
The advantage of (ii) over (i) is that the price distortion to industries is avoided. However, experience&#13;
elsewhere indicates that these budget transfers are either slow in coming or aren't paid at all. (A good&#13;
example of this is the case of pensioners in Russia who receive gas at a 50 percent discount, while the&#13;
remaining 50 percent is expected to be paid by the municipality. Gas distribution companies complain&#13;
that this payment has not been forthcoming.) Option (ii) also suffers from an increased administrative&#13;
cost over option (i). The advantage of option (iii) is that all prices reflect their economic cost, providing&#13;
the consumer with appropriate incentives (households could profit considerably from adjusting their&#13;
consumption). However, it is administratively burdensome and difficult to implement. Therefore, the&#13;
recommended gas price strategy for households is to increase these prices gradually, while maintaining&#13;
financial viability for utilities through cross-subsidies if necessary. When a safety net is established, the&#13;
cross-subsidy should be removed and replaced by efficient gas prices to households.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPTION AND COSTS OF ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS&#13;
1.    The objective of the Energy Efficiency component of the Gas Rehabilitation Project is to identify&#13;
and implement energy-saving measures that will increase the efficiency of natural gas use in the district&#13;
heating and combined heat and power plants and satisfy the criteria of economic and financial feasibility.&#13;
Natural gas use was assessed in four Russian cities - Ryazan, Saratov, Volgograd and Voronezh. All&#13;
these cities have similar gas supply systems.&#13;
2.    Typically all cities have two to five cogeneration plants owned by the energy utility; for example,&#13;
Ryazanenergo, which generates electricity and heat. The heating medium, usually hot water, is heated&#13;
in hot water boilers and/or steam-water heat exchangers by steam extracted from the turbines. The hot&#13;
water is pumped through the transmission piping to the intermediate substations owned by municipal&#13;
district heating companies that resell the heat to the customers. The power plants do not usually sell heat&#13;
directly to the customers, although there are exceptions. In turn, municipal companies usually have their&#13;
own hot water boilers, and besides the resold heat energy, sell hot water directly to the customers.&#13;
Generally, the customers do not have heat energy meters. The power plants and municipal boiler plants&#13;
have flow meters but often they are not accurate or not functioning. The nominal efficiency of boilers&#13;
installed at power plants is relatively high at close to 90 percent, although the real operational efficiency&#13;
is lower due to inadequate automatic combustion control, while that of the municipal boilers is very low,&#13;
ranging from 45 percent to 50 percent.&#13;
3.    The gas conservation measures recommended include:&#13;
-     burner and boiler replacements at municipal boilers;&#13;
-     implementation of portable control instrumentation sets for diagnostics at power plants&#13;
and municipal boilers to achieve better operational efficiency;&#13;
-     installation of automated control systems at boiler plants; and&#13;
-     installation of automatic temperature controls and heat energy meters at heat substations.&#13;
4.    During project preparation, a number of subprojects were identified for the DH/CHP plants in&#13;
each of the cities, all of which met the minimum EIRR requirement of 20 percent. During appraisal, a&#13;
selection of two to three subprojects in each city were advanced considerably and are ready for&#13;
preparation of draft tender documents. The full range of identified subprojects are summarized in Tables&#13;
1 through 4. Those projects whose preparation was advanced during the appraisal mission are described&#13;
in Section A to D below and summarized in Tables 5 through 8. All of the projects satisfy the criterion&#13;
of a 20-percent internal rate of return on gas savings except a proposed US$ 3 million boiler replacement&#13;
project in Voronezh where the return on gas savings remains at 14 percent, but with other benefits at 19&#13;
percent.&#13;
A. City of Ryazan&#13;
5.    District heating is supplied from three primary sources including Ryazanenergo that owns two&#13;
co-generation power plants (Novoryazanskaya TETS and Dyagilevskaya TETS), the Municipal District&#13;
Heating Company and Industrial Boiler Plants.&#13;
6.    The Novo-Ryazanskaya TETS CO, Ltd is a producer of electricity, steam, and hot water, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

was privatized in 1994. The station is rated at 400 MW electric production and installed thermal capacity&#13;
of 2009 Gcal/hr. There is approximately 160 km of piping in this system. The district heating piping&#13;
is generally above ground until it reaches the city substation interfaces. There are approximately 100&#13;
substations in the system and each substation serves 10 to 20 buildings. Some older apartment buildings,&#13;
large factories, and hospitals typically have their own heating boilers. In 1993 the power plant consumed&#13;
about 1 million m3 of natural gas and some 300,000 tons of mazut. The power production was about&#13;
2,000 GWh.&#13;
7.    The gas saving recommendations include:&#13;
-     installation of automated controls and replacing the burners at boilers; and&#13;
-     implementation of a portable set of control instrumentation for&#13;
diagnostics and control.&#13;
8.    The Municipal District Heating Company (municipal department) has a heat-only capacity of&#13;
1,545 Gcal/hr. Recommended gas-saving measures include installation of automated temperature controls&#13;
and heat energy meters at 35 heat substations;&#13;
9.    The total implementation cost for the selected district heating gas conservation projects in Ryazan&#13;
is $ 2.0 million and the expected reduction in gas consumption is 22 million m3 per year.&#13;
B.    City of Saratov&#13;
10.   District heating in Saratov is supplied from Saratovenergo - an open joint stock company&#13;
(privatized 1993) - which owns four cogeneration power plants, GRES, TETS 1, TETS 2, TETS 5 and&#13;
a district heating boiler plant, and the Municipal District Heating Company which owns 52 boiler plants&#13;
and 33 substations. Additional plants owned by various Saratov entities include Industrial Boiler Plants&#13;
consisting of 196 boiler facilities and District Heating Boiler Plants consisting of 304 heat-only boiler&#13;
facilities.&#13;
11.   The Municipal District Heating Company owns 52 boiler plants and 33 substations.&#13;
Thirty-three substations separate the responsibility of the central cogeneration plant system from the&#13;
municipal district heating systems. In 1993, total gas consumption by 52 municipally owned heat-only&#13;
boiler plants was reported as approximately 30,000 (1000) m3. The average efficiency of boiler plants&#13;
is 50-52 percent. Total peak heat load of the 52 boiler plants is estimated at 55 Gcal/hr. Dates of&#13;
installation range from 1954 to 1990.&#13;
12.   Gas saving recommendations include:&#13;
-     replacement of old burners at municipal boilers with new high-efficiency burners and&#13;
associated controls; and&#13;
-     implementation of a portable set of express control instrumentation for diagnostics and&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
13.   Saratovenergo Ltd owns Saratov GRES, TETS 1, TETS 2 and TETS 5. Saratov GRES has a&#13;
total capacity of 55 MW. The date of installation ranges from 1941 to 1985. There are nine steam&#13;
boilers installed, rated from 45 to 95 tons/hr, and a total heating capacity of 276 Gcal/hr. The GRES&#13;
produced and supplied to the customers 1,353,204 Gcal of heat in 1992. TETS I has a total capacity of&#13;
25 MW and the total heating capacity of the plant is 276 Gcallhr. The TETS produced and supplied to&#13;
the customers 976,440 Gcal of heat in 1992. The total gas consumption in 1992 was 140,505 (1000) in3&#13;
TETS 2 has a total capacity of 315 MW and a total heating capacity of 1,090 Gcal/hr. It produced and&#13;

22.   The total implementation cost for selected district heating gas conservation projects in Volgograd&#13;
is $ 3.6 million and the expected reduction in gas consumption is 69 million m3 per year.&#13;
D.    City of Voronezh&#13;
23.   District heating is supplied from three primary sources, including Voronezhenergo, the Municipal&#13;
District Heating Company, and Industrial Boiler Plants consisting of 10 boiler facilities.&#13;
24.   Voronezhenergo (open joint stock company) owns two cogeneration power plants - TETS- I and&#13;
TETS-2, a District Heating Company which purchases heat from cogeneration plants and two small boiler&#13;
rooms containing 8 boilers. TETS-1 and TETS-2 produce about 25 percent of the total heat consumed&#13;
by the city. The plants supply this heat to the Voronezhenergo DH Company which produces an&#13;
additional 10-12 percent of heat and sells all the heat produced by Voronezhenergo (35-37 percent of the&#13;
total heat supply) to its customers. TETS 1 has a heating capacity of 1,550 Gcal/hr and an electric&#13;
capacity of 165 MW; Voroneshenergo's fuel consumption in 1993 was 1,960,000 (1000 m3) gas and&#13;
106,000 ton of mazut.&#13;
Gas saving recommendations include:&#13;
-     replacement of burners and installation of associated automated controls at existing boilers&#13;
at TETS-1; and&#13;
-     Implementing a portable set of instrumentation for diagnostics and control of the existing&#13;
equipment.&#13;
The Municipal District Heating Company is a part of the city administration; its 137 boilers supply&#13;
about 20 percent of the city's district heating needs.&#13;
25.   Gas saving measures include:&#13;
-     replacement of old boilers with new high-efficiency boilers with associated controls; and&#13;
-     automatic temperature controls for heat substations.&#13;
26.   The total implementation cost for selected district heating gas conservation projects in Voronezh&#13;
is $ 4.4 million and the expected reduction in gas consumption is 37 million m3 per year.&#13;
E.    Summary - Tables 9 and 10 summarize the potential and the evaluated projects in the four cities,&#13;
in terms of total capital cost and total annual gas savings. In order to mazimize the impact of the&#13;
proposed investment in energy savings subprojects, RESF has been encouraged to replicate the "evaluate"&#13;
projects shown in Table 10 in other cities (initially, St. Petersburg, followed by Vladimir, Samara, Nizhi-&#13;
Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don and Stavropol). This would result in total expected gas savings of about 0.5&#13;
BCM per year, based on disbursement of the full amount of the loan directed towards energy efficiency&#13;
(US$60 million) is disbursed.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
GDC TRAINING/TWINNING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Summary&#13;
As gas distribution companies (GDC) in Russia move from state-ownership and control into being&#13;
investor-owned joint stock companies, there is an urgent need for substantial enlargement of their&#13;
management, financial, marketing and to a more limited extent, technical skills. Each GDC would&#13;
benefit from a significant number of its senior employees being exposed, in depth, to practices in&#13;
commercially run gas companies. The scale of the requirement would best be met by "twinning"&#13;
arrangements between Russian and foreign gas utilities. The overall cost for each twinning arrangement&#13;
is estimated to cost about US$1.6m over a two-year period.&#13;
Background&#13;
The process of transforming local GDCs in Russia into joint stock companies was initiated by Presidential&#13;
Decree in December 1992 and is now well advanced. Final clearance of each individual organization's&#13;
proposals has been given for about 50 percent of all the utilities by August 1993 and the remainder are&#13;
expected to be approved by November. Allocation of shares follows shortly after approval with&#13;
employees of an enterprises owning either 40 percent or 51 percent, depending on the variant chosen.&#13;
The remaining shares will be held for the next 3 years by various municipal and state bodies, after which&#13;
a decision will be made on further disposals.&#13;
Or2anization&#13;
The Board of Directors of the new companies will initially comprise the General Director of the&#13;
company, representatives of municipal and state bodies and a Trade Union representative. Internally,&#13;
companies will probably follow existing practice, using a Management Board comprising the General&#13;
Director, Deputy Directors and up to 5-10 Heads of Departments. Employee numbers range from a few&#13;
hundred in the smaller city companies up to several thousand in the larger city and regional companies.&#13;
Typically, they are organized into 3 main functional groups - engineering (employing the great majority),&#13;
economic and financial (mainly billing and bookkeeping) and general administrative services (stores and&#13;
buildings).&#13;
Training Requirements&#13;
Six gas distribution companies (Ryazan, Voronezh, Volgograd, Saratov, Stavropol and Rostov-on-the&#13;
Don) have been visited by World Bank missions to prepare the proposed Gas Distribution Reconstruction&#13;
and Energy Efficiency Project. These missions have concluded that the senior management of the&#13;
companies need to upgrade their skills to enable them to manage their new business entities in a&#13;
commercial environment.  They appear to be proceeding on the assumption that their present&#13;
organizational structure will continue to be appropriate and that management issues and practices will be&#13;
little changed. This is understandable in the light of the many other urgent problems that they have had&#13;
to handle over the last year, but does not provide a good basis for taking advantage of their new status.&#13;
Managers in the GDCs will in fact need to adapt rapidly to a changing environment, and to take&#13;
responsibility for their business strategies and decisions. In these new circumstances, there are many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 2 of 24&#13;
areas where existing staff have not had the exposure to the business skills which they will require. This&#13;
is not to doubt that the staff have the capacity to acquire these skills but, up to now, there have been no&#13;
means for them to do so.&#13;
Senior managers in all the utilities visited regret that they have had little or no opportunity for contacts&#13;
with their counterparts in gas utilities operating abroad. They are particularly concerned about this in&#13;
respect of engineering developments and are less focused on the gap in management practices because&#13;
of the lack of familiarity with business management in a market economy. However, there is a general&#13;
awareness of the need to develop new skills and there is no doubt that initiatives to meet this need would&#13;
be welcomed.&#13;
Such institutional reform and development would require staff at a range of different levels to be trained&#13;
to understand more fully the demands placed on an investor-owned company in a market economy, and&#13;
to acquire the professional expertise that is necessary to meet these demands. The scope for training is,&#13;
therefore, considerable, both in the range of topics to be covered and in the number of managers within&#13;
each company who would benefit.&#13;
In view of the urgency of initiating comprehensive training arrangements, it is desirable to proceed&#13;
simultaneously on a number of fronts. For example, training should be provided in parallel both for the&#13;
top management and for middle-management. A good grounding in business management practices for&#13;
top managers will pay off quickly only if trained supporting staff are available to implement the new&#13;
procedures. Conversely, training middle-management specialists in modern techniques could lead to&#13;
disillusion and cynicism if top management is then not receptive and eager to use these techniques in its&#13;
decision-making.&#13;
The specialist areas that should be covered include business planning, accounting and finance, investment&#13;
appraisal, systems development (including use of computers), sales and marketing, procurement,&#13;
personnel management, shareholder services and efficiency improvement. Some technical training may&#13;
be provided by consultants and contractors as part of reconstruction and energy efficiency projects but&#13;
more comprehensive training in modern gas distribution engineering practices is also desirable. These&#13;
areas are set out in more detail in the Annex.&#13;
For the most senior management in each company more general training should be provided on managing&#13;
a joint stock company, including accountability to a Board of Directors and shareholders. Senior&#13;
managers also require a broad initiation into the more specialist areas so that they can be aware of their&#13;
potential benefits and properly manage the newly-trained staff.&#13;
Length and Character of Training&#13;
Management and technical skills cannot be acquired overnight and theoretical classroom training is of&#13;
limited value. To meet the objectives outlined above, a significant number of employees in each GDC&#13;
should spend a period of at least three months, and preferably six months, working in a gas distribution&#13;
utility abroad. Experience has shown (particularly the technical assistance component of the Marshall&#13;
Plan) that on-the-job training of this kind is effective in communicating both theoretical and practical&#13;
knowledge, while stimulating enthusiasm and a desire to exercise the new skills. It is important,&#13;
however, to recognize that the trainee must have acquired a working knowledge of the language of the&#13;
host country before embarking on the training process. It would be impractical to provide an interpreter&#13;
with each trainee and much of value would be lost if language were a serious obstacle. Trainees should,&#13;
therefore, receive adequate language training before travel and the cost should be included in the financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 3 of 24&#13;
provision. The rapid acquisition of language skill also requires enthusiasm and commitment and this&#13;
suggests that more trainees should probably be drawn from younger rather than older age groups; this&#13;
would, in any cases, be desirable so that this program produces a cadre of trained and motivated middle-&#13;
management for the future.&#13;
For the most senior management in each company, it is unlikely that personnel could be absent for an&#13;
extended period or that they would be able quickly to acquire a new language skill. Training for this&#13;
group, therefore, should take the form of shorter courses and seminars covering general management at&#13;
which interpreters would be available.&#13;
Organization of Training&#13;
The desirable emphasis of on-the-job training, coupled with the significant number of staff to be included&#13;
from each GDC, strongly suggests that such training would most effectively be organized within a&#13;
"twinning" arrangement. A Russian GDC would be linked with a similar company in North America&#13;
or Western Europe on a continuing basis, providing benefits over a long period. In the initial two years,&#13;
some 4-6 individuals (depending on the size of the GDC) would spend six months with the host company,&#13;
the arrangement to be repeated four times. The advantage of this approach is that it would not overly&#13;
tax the host GDC and would provide an opportunity to reinforce new skills as each team returns (there&#13;
is a danger that the skills will be lost if periodic reinforcement isn't established).&#13;
The Russian and the host companies would each appoint a co-ordinating officer who would set up the&#13;
necessary arrangements, monitor the progress of the trainees and develop the program in the light of&#13;
experience. The program should be intensive, with readily identifiable deliverables for each team.&#13;
Towards the end of the initial two-year period, the further training needs of the Russian GDC would be&#13;
jointly reviewed and a continuing program developed.&#13;
A preliminary estimate of the cost of such a program suggests, that the direct cost of sending an&#13;
individual to a foreign utility for a six-month period could be US$25,000 with a similar sum incurred&#13;
by the host utility in providing the facilities. For a group of six individuals repeated four times over a&#13;
two-year, the total would be US$1 .2m per company. In addition, the arrangements for short-term visits&#13;
and seminars for training senior management would cost a further US$0.4m.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
A twinning arrangement between a Russian GDC and a foreign utility would provide an effective means&#13;
of organizing urgently needed business, professional and technical training for middle and senior&#13;
management. The business and personal contacts made should also prove valuable to both Russian and&#13;
foreign utilities over the longer-term.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
RUSSIA ENERGY SAVINGS FUND - INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
The Russia Gas Distribution Rehabilitation and Energy Efficiency Project includes a component for&#13;
financing energy efficiency investments by local district heating and combined-heat-and-power (CHP)&#13;
utilities. It is proposed that the Russian Energy Savings Fund act as an overseer and administrator for&#13;
the Government of Russia, assisting in the identification and appraisal of sub-projects, advising companies&#13;
on implementation issues, and monitoring the financial viability and loan repayment aspects of the&#13;
subsidiary loans.&#13;
OBJECTIVES &amp; SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
In order to successfully fulfil this proposed role, the RESF requests the assistance of consultants who will&#13;
provide technical support and training during the initial period of operation. Specifically, short-term&#13;
experts are required during the first year of the project implementation for one month per quarter (four&#13;
months/year) in each of the following skill areas:&#13;
-energy engineering&#13;
-project economics/financial analysis&#13;
-accounting/administration&#13;
The scope of work for these experts will be to assist and advise the counterpart RESF personnel whose&#13;
skill requirements and responsibilities are described in the attached statement of resource requirements.&#13;
The consultant would also be required to provide an additional technical specialist in energy engineering&#13;
for three weeks every quarter in year one, and for three weeks twice a year during years two and three.&#13;
The qualifications of this technical advisor would be defined by the RESF according to the specific, and&#13;
as yet unknown, sectoral and/or technology-specific needs of the project. RESF anticipates that different&#13;
specialists would be required for most or all of these advisory visits. It is also expected that the advisors&#13;
would serve only the staff of the RESF in year one; in subsequent years, they would advise both the&#13;
RESF and the technical staff of municipal companies, with RESF acting as coordinator for the training&#13;
missions.&#13;
Finally, the consultant would be required to design and deliver two five-day seminars once or twice a&#13;
year, focussed on special topics of relevance to the project, as defined by the RESF. These requirements&#13;
will only be defined after the Project Implementation Unit is staffed and has operated for at least 3&#13;
months.&#13;

RESF Resource Requirements&#13;
Based on the proposed role of the RESF, and a review of its current staffing, capabilities and&#13;
organization, resource requirements are identified as follows:&#13;
Senior Management: Whatever form the RESF implementation group takes, it will need a senior&#13;
manager capable of providing leadership to the group by (i) setting out strategies and policies for the&#13;
group of technical specialists; (ii) providing operating plans and directions for the group and coordinating&#13;
and monitoring its activities; and (iii) serving as liaison with senior levels of both local and federal&#13;
government organizations and foreign (multilateral and bilateral) agencies.&#13;
Energy Engineering Expertise: An energy expert is required to satisfy the technical aspects of RESF'S&#13;
mandate. The energy technology expert would carry out the technical review and assessment of the sub-&#13;
projects, participate in the technical aspects of procurement, tendering and project management and&#13;
control; in conjunction with the engineering specialist, lead the evaluation of completed subprojects and&#13;
the project as a whole; and, assist in the identification and appraisal of additional energy efficiency&#13;
projects. Ideally, the individual would possess university level training in engineering and experience&#13;
with relevant energy efficiency technologies and projects in the industrial and buildings sectors. He&#13;
should be familiar with methods of energy auditing, although it is expected that much of this type of work&#13;
would be contracted out by the RESF. Communications skills are important as the engineer would need&#13;
to liaise with counterpart staff in the municipal utilities.&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis Expertise: The RESF project economist/financial analyst would be&#13;
responsible for the economic and financial aspects of the review and assessment of subprojects; the&#13;
preparation of loan agreements with municipal utilities; assisting in the design and implementation of&#13;
project management and control systems; and participating in subproject and project evaluation activities.&#13;
The analyst would also be responsible for liaison with counterpart staff in Russian government agencies,&#13;
international organizations and the municipal utilities.&#13;
Accounting/Administration: The accountant/administrator would be charged with carrying out the&#13;
project accounting functions of the RESF group, as well as administrative tasks related mainly but not&#13;
entirely to project on-lending and implementation activities. The accountant should have skills in both&#13;
financial and management accounting.&#13;

ENERGY PRICING STRATEGY STUDY&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The World Bank is providing assistance to the Russian Federation in its efforts to commercialize&#13;
the energy supply sector. As part of this process, the Ministry of Fuels and Energy has requested that&#13;
the Bank finance a study to assist them in developing a strategy for making the transition from controlled&#13;
to market-defined pricing of energy products.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    The objectives of the study are three-fold: to assist the Government in defining realistic long-term&#13;
objectives in terms of introducing competitive price setting in the energy sub-sectors; to assist them in&#13;
identifying interim measures and initiatives required to ensure an orderly transition from the current to&#13;
the targeted pricing regime; and to outline a program and time-frame for achieving the shift to market-&#13;
based pricing.&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
3.    The Government has made rapid progress in corporatizing the Russian energy sector. Many of&#13;
the primary and secondary supply enterprises have already been converted to joint stock companies, and&#13;
plans are underway to continue this process. At the same time, concerted efforts have been made to&#13;
adjust and index energy prices, through a series of degrees, in order to bring them closer to world prices&#13;
and to reflect the competitive positions of alternative energy forms. Ultimately, it is the goal of the&#13;
Government to extract itself, insofar as possible, from the pricing process, and allow market forces to&#13;
define energy prices in the country.&#13;
4.     This process of shifting from controlled prices to pricing based on market forces raises a number&#13;
of concerns, both in the long term and in the short term, regarding the strategies which the government&#13;
should adopt to ensure that a system of fair and competitive pricing is achieved. In the longer term,&#13;
concerns center on the steps required to ensure a competitive framework for energy supply both within&#13;
and among energy sectors. This includes defining realistic objectives with regard to establishing&#13;
competition among suppliers, both in terms of market entry and access to customers, identifying strategies&#13;
to facilitate the development of competitive markets both for individual fuels and among alternative forms&#13;
of energy, and defining a regulatory process to be implemented in those sectors where competition may&#13;
be difficult or impossible to achieve in an efficient manner.&#13;
5.    In the near term, concerns center around the strategies to be adopted during the period of&#13;
transition from controlled to market prices. These include identifying mechanisms to adjust for&#13;
distortions in the cost bases of suppliers which could inhibit fair competition, developing a fair and&#13;
equitable basis for reflecting differences in the costs of supply to different markets, making provision to&#13;
protect the basic needs of vulnerable groups, ensuring that "lifeline" supplies can be obtained at&#13;
affordable cost, and defining a schedule and milestones for the transition from regulated to competitive&#13;
pricing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 8 of 24&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
6.    The proposed Energy Pricing Strategy Study is intended to provide guidance to government in&#13;
defining appropriate strategies and policies relating to the establishment of a competitive framework for&#13;
energy pricing. The study will address both long term issues related to sector and sub-sector objectives,&#13;
and transitional strategies to be adopted in moving from current to targeted pricing mechanisms.&#13;
7.    In meeting these objectives, it is anticipated that the consultant would carry out the following&#13;
tasks:&#13;
Phas I&#13;
i.    Review the structure of the commercial energy supply industry in Russia, including petroleum&#13;
products, coal, natural gas, LPG, district heat and electricity, and the degree of competition&#13;
currently prevailing among alternative sources of supply. Where necessary, both wholesale and&#13;
retail supply systems should be considered. In addition, where transformation is involved&#13;
(thermal electric generation, district heating, petroleum refining), issues relating to competition&#13;
among alternative primary energy sources should be reviewed.&#13;
ii.    Review and identify any barriers to long-term competition within and among sectors, including&#13;
supply constraints, restricted access to markets, and financial and institutional barriers to entry.&#13;
iii.    Define a set of realistic long-term objectives for each energy sub-sector in terms of the degree&#13;
to which market mechanisms should be used to define energy prices, and identify the steps which&#13;
need to be taken to achieve this level of competition.&#13;
Pha. e II&#13;
iv.    Where barriers are deemed prohibitive, review alternative mechanisms for regulatory price&#13;
control, and provide detailed recommendations on the preferred regulatory process. These&#13;
recommendations should include the body or bodies responsible for regulation, the basis on which&#13;
regulated prices should be set (including appropriate parameters with regard to rate base, rate of&#13;
return, etc), and the suggested means of ensuring efficient performance in the absence of open&#13;
competition (proficiency audits, price caps, etc).&#13;
V.     Review and outline current sources of distortion in the cost structures of energy supply&#13;
comnpanies, which could lead to inefficient short term pricing decisions. Many of the newly&#13;
privatized enterprises will, for example, have acquired assets at well below net replacement value.&#13;
Hence, pricing based on historic cost could lead to fuel choices which are, in the long term, less&#13;
than desirable. Conversely, pricing at marginal cost, while sending more correct pricing signals&#13;
to markets, would create returns to shareholders which would likely be incompatible with the&#13;
level of investment.&#13;
vi.    Review and evaluate mechanisms that could be used to adjust for short-term cost distortions (for&#13;
example, production taxes, sales taxes, corporatization loans, dividends on government equity).&#13;
Recommend preferred alternatives and provide a schedule for both implementing and for phasing&#13;
out adjustinent mechanisms as distortions are eliminated. Evaluation of alternatives should take&#13;
into account the longer-term needs of the private corporations to raise funds for expansion and&#13;
to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83-&#13;
Annex 62&#13;
Page 9 of 24&#13;
vii.   Review and make recommendations on the need for reduced rates on "lifeline" energy supplies.&#13;
The review should address the level of basic energy needs, as well as the degree of subsidy&#13;
required to ensure affordable lifeline supply. The study should also address and make specific&#13;
recommendations on the preferred method for financing lifeline subsidies (transfer of general tax&#13;
revenues, special taxes, cross-subsidization, etc.).&#13;
viii.  In subsectors where regulated prices are proposed as the preferred pricing mechanism, review&#13;
and make recommendations on the manner in which the Government should deal with the&#13;
disaggregation of prices by region. Specific recommendations on spatial disaggregation of gas&#13;
prices should be addressed.&#13;
ix.    Provide a program for transition from the current regulated pricing mechanisms to the proposed&#13;
long-term market based pricing structure. The program should identify steps and initiatives to&#13;
be undertaken by the government in order to achieve long-term pricing objectives, and should&#13;
indicate milestones at which these government actions should occur.&#13;
x.    Provide a schedule for transition, taking into account the past and proposed rate of change in the&#13;
energy industry, and the time that might be required in order to ensure an orderly progress&#13;
towards competitive pricing.&#13;
DELIVERABLES&#13;
8.    An interim report is required at the end of Phase I (task iii), summarizing the findings with regard&#13;
to the current structure of the energy supply industry, the barriers to competition within the industry, and&#13;
the recommended long-term objectives which should be pursued in terms of competitive energy pricing.&#13;
Provided that these objectives have been established in a satisfactory manner, the consultant will carry&#13;
out the remaining study tasks, and provide a draft final report covering findings and recommended&#13;
strategies and schedules for transition.&#13;
9.    Subsequent to review, the consultant will make agreed amendments and provide a final report,&#13;
integrating both phases of the study.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
THIRD PARTY ACCESS STUDY&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Fuels and Energy of the Russian Federation has requested financing from the&#13;
World Bank to establish a Third Party Access Regulation (TPAR) for gas transit in Russia. The&#13;
Government's objective in establishing the TPAR is to achieve increased economic efficiency in the&#13;
delivery of energy. Institutions and incentives should be established to ensure that access to gas delivery&#13;
and pricing mechanisms would protect the interests of the consumer and establish incentives for investors&#13;
in the gas sector to achieve reasonable returns on their investments as a result of efficient operation.&#13;
Furthermore, the Government is interested in minimizing the administrative burden of regulation by&#13;
maximizing price clearing mechanisms through competition.&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
2.    Russia's gas markets continue to evolve rapidly.  Western and Central European markets&#13;
stagnated during the period from 1990 to 1992, as a result of slow economic growth in the west and&#13;
restructuring in central Europe. These markets have shown some rebound during 1993 and have&#13;
accelerated in early 1994. However, increases in these gas markets have been offset by the decline in&#13;
Russia's gas delivery to the Republics of the Former Soviet Union. Gas prices to these markets have&#13;
been increased considerably, resulting in a market contraction and a build-up of accounts receivable. In&#13;
many of these markets the accounts receivable issue are substantial, and an as yet unresolved problem.&#13;
3.    As both domestic and export markets continue to adjust, energy supply and interfuel substitution&#13;
is expected to change to reflect the evolving market. Given Russia's enormous gas reserves, its relatively&#13;
low cost of supply and its relatively low impact on the environment, gas is expected to continue to&#13;
dominate as the primary fuel of choice for Russia. However, as energy markets in Russia contract with&#13;
decreasing economic activity, industrial restructuring and energy conservation investments, gas supply&#13;
is expected to become market constrained. As a result, gas is expected to saturate the primary energy&#13;
supply market in Russia over the medium term.&#13;
4.    In markets where gas becomes demand constrained, gas pricing is expected to reflect gas-on-gas&#13;
competition (assuming barriers to market access are eliminated and multiple suppliers of gas supply can&#13;
compete for the available markets). In Russia, Gazprom currently enjoys an exclusive monopoly on non-&#13;
associated gas production and gas transmission. This study is designed to assist the Government in&#13;
implementing policies that would make the evolving gas markets more efficient by increasing competition&#13;
as a market clearing mechanism, while preserving the rights and obligations of the consumers and&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
5.    The consultant' would draft a Third Party Access Regulation to enable the Government to&#13;
establish a mechanism to enable increased economic efficiency of energy delivery. The consultant would,&#13;

based on his understanding of the Russian energy system and knowledge of Third party Access practices&#13;
implemented elsewhere, assist the Ministry of Fuels and Energy in drafting this regulation. The tasks&#13;
to be undertaken by the consultant would include, but not be limited to the following:&#13;
6.    Task 1: The consultant would supplement his understanding of the energy delivery system in&#13;
Russia through interviews with the officials from the Ministry of Fuels and Energy, Gazprom, Oil&#13;
Producing Associations (producing associated gas), Rossgazifikazia, newly formed gas distribution&#13;
companies and major gas consumers. Through this exercise, the consultant would assess the impediments&#13;
to the development of gas-on-gas competition in Russia and suggest ways in which these barriers might&#13;
be removed to bring about a more competitive gas industry.&#13;
7.    Task 2: The consultant would outline the main problems associated with establishing Third Part&#13;
Access in Russia. The consultant would prepare a written report which, drawing on experience in other&#13;
countries, sets out the main options that the Government could use to address these issues and how they&#13;
could be implemented as laws, regulations and/or decrees affecting the transport of gas. Unbundling of&#13;
other services (such as storage) would also be reviewed and specific recommendations made.&#13;
8.    Task 3: After a review of the options with the Government and the Bank, the consultant would&#13;
collaborate with officials in the Ministry of Fuels and Energy in drafting specific decrees, laws and/or&#13;
regulations on Third Party Access and related matters.&#13;

GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY PRIVATIZATION STUDY&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Fuels and Energy of the Russian Federation has requested financing from the&#13;
World Bank to assist Rossgazifikazia in undertaking the next steps in privatization of the Gas Distribution&#13;
Companies (GDCs) in Russia.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    The purpose of this study is to assist the Government in determining how to complete the&#13;
privatization process for the GDCs in Russia. The primary goals of the Government are the efficient&#13;
operation of these enterprises upon completion of this process and preservation of domestic interests in&#13;
the distribution of shares. In addition, the Government is interested in the contribution that can be made&#13;
to addressing the fiscal deficit through sales of shares.&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
3.    The first phase of the corporatization/privatization process for GDCs has been completed with&#13;
the formation of over 300 joint stock companies responsible for gas distribution in Russia. Under this&#13;
process, the employees of each GDC were given the option of owning 40 percent or 51 percent of the&#13;
shares, with the remainder owned by the Federal Government and local authorities. Most of the GDCs&#13;
established are profitable, with the exception being those with a relatively high proportion of residential&#13;
consumers. The financial situation of these companies will be addressed by further gas price increases&#13;
and through the establishment of a Gas Stabilization and Reconstruction Fund. This Fund will be&#13;
financed from a 10 percent charge on the differential between GDC purchasing and selling prices.&#13;
4.    The Government has requested the World Bank to finance a gas distribution reconstruction project&#13;
which is currently under preparation. This project will support the Government's initiatives in the gas&#13;
subsector and assist in the financing of gas distribution equipment identified as the result of a feasibility&#13;
study. This project will help GDCs become commercially oriented enterprises.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
5.    The consultant will review the operation of Volgograd Gorgas currently having JSC status as&#13;
candidates for privatization. The GDC's assets, staffing, managerial capabilities, operating policies and&#13;
financial health will be reviewed to determine a privatization plan. The consultant will recommend&#13;
specific actions that should take place prior to privatization.&#13;
6.    Task 1: Review the assets, operational and commercial policies and practices, management&#13;
capability, staff, and financial status of Volgograd Gorgas utilities. Identify key areas that are in need&#13;
of improvement and make specific recommendations regarding actions that should take place prior to&#13;
privatization.&#13;
7.    Task 2: Review optional sources for equity participation, including: (i) domestic capital markets;&#13;
(ii) existing shareholders; (iii) foreign equity participation, and describe the costs and benefits of each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 13 of 24&#13;
8.    Task 3: Prepare alternative approaches to privatization for review by the shareholders. Present&#13;
the options to the shareholders, clearly identifying the next steps that need to be taken.&#13;
9.    Task 4: Assist the Government in preparing for the sale of their shares in the GDCs, taking into&#13;
account the Government's interest in receiving a fair value for their holdings.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION - PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    The Government of the Russian Federation (GOR) has requested the World Bank to finance a Gas&#13;
Distribution Rehabilitation Project (GDRP). In support of this project, the GOR has requested financing&#13;
of a study to undertake system diagnostics and project preparation for the proposed project. This study&#13;
will identify the highest priority investments that would enable Gas Distribution Companies (GDCs) to&#13;
meet the following objectives: (i) reduction of system losses, improved reliability and increased safety&#13;
of system operation; (ii) increased efficiency of customer energy use; (iii) transfer of technology and&#13;
design concepts; and (iv) commercialization of the gas distribution business. The project should be&#13;
prepared within the context of, and be consistent with, broader strategies for short and long term&#13;
development of the gas distribution industry.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    Gas consumption, in Russia, amounted to about 420 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) in 1991, of&#13;
which about 270 BCM (64 percent) is distributed by the distribution organizations that formerly&#13;
comprised RossGaz2 and are now in the process of being formed as Joint Stock Companies (JSC's).&#13;
Starting with intensive measures in the mid 1950s, the gas distribution industry has evolved to a position&#13;
where, by 1992, 218,000 km. of distribution pipelines supply 17.4 million households, 56,000&#13;
commercial consumers and 12,400 industries in 71 major distribution areas, with overall coordination by&#13;
RossGaz.&#13;
3.    Much of the distribution system suffers from corrosion-induced pipeline ruptures. Each year 300-&#13;
500 ruptures are caused by this problem. Insufficient cathodic protection and inadequate maintenance&#13;
due to insufficient supply of materials have been the primary sources of the problem. As a result,&#13;
Rossgaz estimates that 10,000 km of distribution pipelines are in need of replacement, of which 3,000&#13;
km is in urgent need of replacement or tubing with polyethylene (PE) pipes. A limited (5 km)&#13;
replacement program using PE pipes has been initiated on a pilot basis, which GDCs wish to accelerate.&#13;
4.    The role and structure of natural gas supply in meeting energy demands is likely to evolve&#13;
significantly in several areas over the next decade, including: (i) increased use of gas in power generation;&#13;
(ii) changes in the role of gas in household energy use and district heating; (iii) improvements in end-use&#13;
energy efficiency due to active energy efficiency efforts coupled with price rationalization and increased&#13;
use of metering; (iv) changing needs in the industrial and commercial sectors due to structural changes&#13;
in the economy; and (v) the impact of the use of new technologies. During 1993 the structure of the gas&#13;
distribution entities has changed considerably, with Rosstrojgazifikazia being split up into multiple&#13;
independent joint stock companies organized on the basis of oblast (or krai or republic) levels or city&#13;
levels.&#13;
5.    Gas use in households is largely limited to cooking, as hot water and space heating is mainly&#13;
supplied form a centralized district heating system. The current design of the district heating system is&#13;
2/The remainder is supplied by Gazprom (25 percent), MosGaz and LenGaz (5 percent each) in Moscow and&#13;
St. Petersburg, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 15 of 24&#13;
considered to be sub-optimal for many reasons, including high losses, inadequate controls, poor service,&#13;
and (implicitly) high costs of operation. Where district heating is economically efficient, the economic&#13;
prudence of gas service exclusively for cooking (as opposed to electricity-based stoves) is questionable.&#13;
Therefore, the relative role of district heating, electricity and gas use in households and commercial&#13;
buildings needs to be assessed before major investments in rehabilitation take place.&#13;
6.     The current system of energy delivery to households suffers from poor service. Space heating&#13;
is considered to be unreliable and inadequate.  Heating controls are virtually non-existent with&#13;
temperature largely controlled by opening windows. Stoves are reportedly also used to supplement the&#13;
inadequacy of heat delivery. Hot water supply is curtailed for about two weeks each summer while the&#13;
district heating system is taken out of service for repair. The scope for economically prudent increases&#13;
in energy use should be identified and a plan to address this issue should be developed.&#13;
7.     Longer term development of the gas distribution system will possibly include upgrading of the&#13;
existing low pressure steel network to a medium pressure PE based network to allow increased gas&#13;
demands to be met. A program of household metering will also be required. These needs and their&#13;
impacts must be assessed within the context of the overall demand for gas.&#13;
8.     The gas distribution industry is in the process of being privatized and adopting commercial&#13;
orientation. The first stage will occur during the first quarter of 1993 with full privatization starting in&#13;
1996. The ultimate structure of the industry is not yet finalized but the local distribution companies have&#13;
requested technical assistance to further develop commercial functions.&#13;
9.     Gas distribution companies will likely face cash flow limitations over the next 5 years and will&#13;
have limited access to foreign exchange. Rehabilitation solutions should therefore consider optimal use&#13;
of local goods and services.&#13;
10.    The Government has selected Volgograd Gorgas for their distribution rehabilitation efforts.&#13;
Study Objectives&#13;
11.   The consultant should prepare a work plan for comprehensive studies of a selected number of&#13;
cities. To enable the studies to be undertaken quickly, and because of the similarities in system design&#13;
among all cities, the consultant is encouraged to propose a structure to his work program that would&#13;
minimize duplication of effort. The study is designed to consist of three main elements: (i) demand&#13;
analysis; (ii) project preparation; and, (iii) institutional reform. The primary purpose of the study is to&#13;
quickly identify high rate of return, short gestation projects for each city that would be a component of&#13;
the long term gas distribution system development. In order that this objective is achieved, it is expected&#13;
that a team of foreign experts will work closely with a team of Russian counterparts to identify the&#13;
highest priority investments (both in terms of increased effectiveness of supply and increased end-use&#13;
efficiency). The study has four principle objectives - preparation of a gas distribution rehabilitation&#13;
project, increases in the efficiency of energy use, technology transfer and institutional reform - outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
12.   Prepare Distribution Network Reconstruction Project: Provision of reliable, low-cost gas to&#13;
Russian consumers requires investment in network reconstruction to reduce losses and improve safety.&#13;
The current gas distribution system is suspected of having relatively high losses due to pipe corrosion,&#13;
but the level of losses is unknown largely due to the lack of metering of gas consumption in households.&#13;
A technical audit of the distribution system to improve the estimate of current losses and the potential for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 16 of 24&#13;
savings from loss reduction and the development of a short term loss reduction program/strategy&#13;
consistent with the overall network rehabilitation program will be undertaken. The study will identify&#13;
a program of high priority distribution investments required over the next five years, along with&#13;
evaluation and preparation of specific projects in each city. This study and the resulting project will&#13;
provide critical inputs into the development of strategies for reconstruction of the gas distribution industry&#13;
over the next 5 years. The need for essential short-term investments should be balanced with the long-&#13;
term development of the network, based on consideration of strategic factors, some of which are outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
13.   Efficient Use of Energy: In comparison with norms in other countries, Russia's unit energy&#13;
consumption is unusually high. Drawing on earlier district heating and other related studies, the&#13;
consultant should review the scope for energy efficiency enhancements in a selected number of industries,&#13;
commercial enterprises and households to identify an investment strategy to improve the efficiency of gas&#13;
use. The objectives of the energy efficiency program would be to: free up gas for exports; reduce the&#13;
impact of gas price reform on downstream enterprises (and thus, the ability to pay); and reduce the&#13;
impact of energy use on the environment. For the housing stock, the consultant will prepare a design&#13;
competition to focus on three typical existing apartment complexes. The competition (which will be&#13;
prepared for financing under the proposed project) will focus on energy efficiency potential, and will also&#13;
address improvements in the quality of the housing stock. The consultant will identify a program of&#13;
technically and economically viable energy efficiency improvement measures and make specific&#13;
recommendations as to how to foster their implementation.&#13;
14.   Transfer of Technologv: The study will also introduce technologies used by the gas industry&#13;
outside of Russia, including, but not limited to: (i) distribution network design standards; (ii) the use of&#13;
different materials such as PE pipe; (iii) data acquisition and control technologies; and (iv) end-use&#13;
technologies.&#13;
15.   Institutional Reforn: The local distribution units are currently undergoing a major transformation&#13;
in corporate structure as a result of a decree signed by the President on December 8, 1992. RossGaz and&#13;
the GDCs have become joint-stock companies. This is the first step in a process of commercialization&#13;
that may eventually lead to full privatization. The consultant will review the institutional reforms&#13;
necessary to support this transfer of responsibilities and make specific recomnmendations on changes in&#13;
systems and procedures within each entity.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
16.   Based on the above background and objectives, the consultant is required to undertake this study&#13;
in three phases: (i) within the first three months, the consultant will prepare a diagnosis of the existing&#13;
situation to determine general changes in the role of gas in meeting energy needs and prepare a list of&#13;
short gestation, high return investments that will meet the immediate needs; (ii)one month after review&#13;
of the phase-one results by the GDCs and the World Bank, the consultant will prepare a project which&#13;
may be financed by the World Bank and/or other donors; and (iii) preparation of tender documents. The&#13;
major areas of investigation are outlined below.&#13;
Demand Analysis&#13;
17.   Gas Demand Forecast: Development of strategies for short and long term network reconstruction&#13;
and development will need to consider the implications of alternate levels of gas demand. Demand&#13;
scenarios should be developed with due consideration to the dynamics of the economy, changes in local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 17 of 24&#13;
economic structure including potential new investments, expected changes in gas consumption patterns&#13;
due to income and price changes, energy use, and a possible revised role for gas use in households. The&#13;
consultant should involve the local distribution company staff in the process of producing forecasts&#13;
including development of a simple end-use forecast model.&#13;
18.   Efficient Use of Energy: The potential for increases in energy efficiency should be assessed for&#13;
a diverse group of selected industries (about 8 per city) and commercial enterprises to determine cost-&#13;
effective investments and changes in operating practices that would reduce energy consumption. The&#13;
consultant should evaluate the achievable level of energy savings assuming gas price to industry is&#13;
adjusted to US$40/MCM equivalent. Energy audits for a selected number of enterprises in each city&#13;
should be undertaken. To the extent possible, efforts should focus on industries that are expected to&#13;
become or remain financially viable. The consultant should also examine alternate and innovative financial&#13;
and institutional means for funding such investments.&#13;
19.   Drawing on earlier district heating system and other related studies, the consultant will review&#13;
the overall provision of heating services to non-industrial customers and evaluate the costs and benefits&#13;
of changes which would improve the quality of services supplied. As a parallel exercise, the consultant&#13;
will prepare a design competition, to be included under the proposed project, which focusses on&#13;
apartment complex retrofit to improve building quality and reduce energy consumption. Designs for three&#13;
typical apartment complexes should be included as part of the competition.&#13;
20.   The Role of Gas: The consultant will evaluate the relative economic costs of heat and hot water&#13;
services from existing district heating versus residential gas boilers or electric boilers and stoves. This&#13;
will include an assessment of the long-term least-cost means of providing space heating, hot water and&#13;
cooking services to new and existing residential and commercial developments and evaluation of the&#13;
economically prudent geographic limit of existing district heating.&#13;
Project Preparation&#13;
21.    Asset Review: The state of distribution assets in place must first be evaluated to determine&#13;
priority investments, keeping in mind safety, loss reduction and environmental impacts. A maintenance&#13;
program for each city should be developed including corrosion protection, safety improvements, defect&#13;
monitoring, data acquisition and system control. The consultant should work closely with city distribution&#13;
staff in designing this program. This work would be complemented by visits of Russian staff to gas&#13;
distribution companies outside Russia.&#13;
22.   Specifically, the consultant should assess the present and forecast levels of system losses through&#13;
leakage in order that a priority investment program can be identified. The consultant will suggest a&#13;
program for undertaking this assessment. This analysis will be key in determining equipment to be&#13;
procured under the project. Cathodic protection should also be reviewed and recommendations, from the&#13;
system design perspective, should address this issue.&#13;
23.   Local Material Supply Capability: The consultant will provide an assessment of local supply&#13;
capability for potential goods and services required for the distribution network reconstruction project and&#13;
inform potential suppliers of the project and the requirements to participate in ICB bidding.&#13;
24.   Network Reconstruction and Development Strategies: Based on review of the existing network&#13;
configuration, the status of system losses and reliability and the future demand for gas, the consultant will&#13;
develop short and long term reconstruction and development strategies. An inventory of high priority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 18 of 24&#13;
investments for the next 5 years should be developed along with illustrative longer term investment&#13;
requirements. These recommendations should incorporate evaluation of existing design concepts and&#13;
standards relative to international practice and the scope for technology transfer. The consultant should&#13;
examine the costs and benefits of alternate design configurations including, but not limited to:&#13;
(i) maintain the use of the existing low pressure steel pipe system;&#13;
(ii) maintain the existing low pressure system but base expansion on medium pressure pipeline;&#13;
(iii) increase network capacity by phasing out the low pressure system, gradually replacing it with a&#13;
medium pressure network;&#13;
(iv) gradually substitute gas use in households, where it is only used for cooking, with electric stoves and&#13;
the cost effectiveness of alternate residential meter arrangements.&#13;
25.   Economic Analysis: The economic analysis will evaluate the least-cost development strategy of&#13;
energy supply, including an approximate estimate of the relative role of gas, electricity, and district&#13;
heating. The least-cost analysis will include both demand side and supply side investments. A ranking&#13;
of proposed investments for each of the cities will be established as an input to determining the highest&#13;
priority investments to be financed under the project proposed for World Bank financing. A specific&#13;
economic analysis of the highest priority investments for each city will be included to enable the&#13;
investments to be ranked.&#13;
26.   Project Preparation: Based on the results of a review of the proposed investments for each city,&#13;
the local distribution companies, the World Bank and the consultant will prepare the project, including&#13;
a detailed cost estimate (local and foreign costs in mid-1993 prices, local and foreign inflation, physical&#13;
contingencies, taxes and duties and interest during construction), contract packaging, implementation&#13;
schedule and proposed project management. After the broad scope of the project has been sanctioned&#13;
by the Executing Agencies and the World Bank, the consultant will assist the Executing Agencies to&#13;
prepare tender documents that meet World Bank guidelines.&#13;
27.   Environmental Analysis: An Environmental Assessment (EA) will be prepared for the proposed&#13;
project to ensure that the project meets the Environmental Guidelines of the Russian Federation, the&#13;
World Bank and those of local authorities. Attachment I provides a brief (non-exhaustive) guide to the&#13;
issues that should be addressed in the EA. The EA must be completed within four months of project&#13;
inception.&#13;
Institutional Reform&#13;
28.   Financial Analysis:  Based on pro-forma projections of the distribution company's Income&#13;
Statement, Balance Sheet and Sources and Application of Funds Statements for the years 1993 to 2003,&#13;
a financing plan should be developed by the consultants in close collaboration with the proposed&#13;
Executing Agency which would meet future funding requirements, including: the proposed high priority&#13;
investments, the longer term development program, on-going O&amp;M expenditures and adequate levels of&#13;
working capital. The financial projections should be based on clearly identified targets for rate of return&#13;
on current valued assets, self-financing, liquidity, and capital structure that would satisfy potential&#13;
(private) investors and creditors. An estimate should be made of the margins and resulting natural gas&#13;
and LPG prices required to ensure financial viability. Local company staff should participate in the&#13;
analysis including development of a spreadsheet financial model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 19 of 24&#13;
29.   As support for the process of corporatization and eventual privatization of the distribution&#13;
companies, the consultant will review the existing legal and regulatory framework which currently&#13;
governs the operations of the distribution companies and assess whether any administrative changes are&#13;
necessary to facilitate the transformation into joint-stock companies. The consultant will also review the&#13;
internal changes within the distribution companies that may be required as part of this change in status&#13;
including: the development of adequate systems of accountability to the shareholder, financial reporting,&#13;
organization structure, staffing and labor relations, billing procedures and systems, contracting services,&#13;
marketing and management information systems and make recommendations for development of these&#13;
practices, systems and staff. The consultant should identify current internal functions which would be&#13;
cost-effective candidates for eventual separation from the organization. The review should also contain&#13;
recommendations on what further legal or institutional changes may be required to prepare the joint-stock&#13;
company for transfer into private ownership. In addition, a diagnostic study of short term management&#13;
information requirements should be carried out. Cash management procedures (including receivable,&#13;
payable and inventory systems and strategies) should be examined in particular detail. The consultant&#13;
will identify critical areas where the distribution company would benefit from short term advisory services&#13;
and technical assistance and prepare terms of reference in conjunction with distribution company&#13;
management.&#13;
30.   The distribution companies will be required to maintain separate and auditable accounts for the&#13;
rehabilitation project with the goal of ensuring loan proceeds are utilized efficiently and for the intended&#13;
purposes. The contracted firm will assist the distribution company in enhancement of current project&#13;
accounting procedures and systems to ensure full accountability of project funds and enable timely&#13;
preparation of project progress and completion reports. The distribution companies will also be required&#13;
to prepare year-end financial statements according to both Russian standards and Generally Acceptable&#13;
Accounting Principles (GAAP). To support this the consultant will provide seminars on financial&#13;
accounting principles and practice and the adjusting entries required to transform Russian accounts to&#13;
basic international GAAP. Initial seminars should be directed at middle to senior management of the&#13;
distribution company with later seminars directed at specific accounting and economics functions in the&#13;
company.&#13;
31.   In preparation for financial audits the consultant (in conjunction with the asset review task&#13;
described in para 21) should assist the distribution companies to computerize their fixed asset register,&#13;
with due regard for materiality. All assets required for distribution operations, regardless of ownership,&#13;
should be included. This task should be carried out in consultation with the distribution companies&#13;
appointed auditors.&#13;
32.   Technology Transfer: Each city in the study will be twinned with a foreign distribution company.&#13;
Local staff, including one person from each of the following departments; (i) procurement; (ii)&#13;
accounting; (iii) maintenance; (iv) marketing and energy use; and (v) engineering, controls and safety,&#13;
will visit with counterpart staff for a period of approximately 6 weeks to learn about international&#13;
operating practices. They will be responsible for preparing logs and reports which will be presented upon&#13;
their return to Russia. There will likely be 2 or 3 study groups. The consultant will be responsible for&#13;
organizing the visits and should provide one person to coordinate the activities at each city. In addition,&#13;
a general manager from each Russian company will participate, who, in addition to learning about&#13;
international operating practices, should be exposed to the regulatory aspects of the local gas distributor,&#13;
the role of federal government agencies and the local and national Gas Associations.&#13;

Scheduling and Reporting&#13;
33.   The consultant will report, in writing, to the GDCs and The World Bank: (i) upon the completion&#13;
of the identification of the priority projects; (ii) upon the completion of project preparation; and (iii) after&#13;
the completion of the tender documents. The consultant will work closely with the GDCs, maximizing&#13;
their participation in the diagnosis and project preparation in order to combine the best of foreign and&#13;
Russian technology.&#13;
34.   The consultant will submit eleven (11) copies of the first report to Rossgaz and the GDCs: (10)&#13;
in Russian and (1) in English; and ten (10) copies of the English version of the report to both and the&#13;
World Bank, within three months of the study inception. Based on the recommendations of this report&#13;
and subsequent discussions with the GDCs, RossGaz and the World Bank, the consultant will finalize&#13;
project preparation (including the EA) for a proposed World Bank project within one month of receiving&#13;
final directions from the GDCs and RossGaz in project definition.&#13;
35.   Upon the completion of project preparation, a draft final report will be submitted as described&#13;
above for the Phase I report. This report will form the basis of the World Bank appraisal of the proposed&#13;
project. Based on subsequent discussions with the GDCs and the World Bank, the consultant will assist&#13;
the GDCs staff to prepare tender documents in a manner which will satisfy World Bank guidelines.&#13;
Assistance to be Provided by the GDCs&#13;
36.   The GDCs will provide the following support services and facilities to the consultant without cost:&#13;
i)    assistance in obtaining visas, customs clearance, and any other administrative permits required&#13;
on behalf of the consultant in performing this assignment;&#13;
ii)    all relevant data, maps, surveys, studies, development plans, gas supply and similar information;&#13;
iii)   liaison with the Government of the Russian Federation, local government bodies, local&#13;
distribution companies and consumers;&#13;
iv)    estimates of the costs, availability and quantity of locally supplied materials, equipment, labor&#13;
and construction and installation services; and&#13;
(v)    a counterpart team for each group of cities to assist in the diagnostic and project preparation&#13;
components of the study.&#13;
Environmnental Aspects of the Proposed&#13;
Gas Distribution Rehabilitation Project&#13;
The Government of the Russian Federation requires that an Environmental Assessment (EA) be&#13;
undertaken for any significant gas distribution rehabilitation project as a component of an overall project&#13;
study. Furthermore, any gas project including a foreign exchange component in excess of 100 million&#13;
Roubles requires an EA satisfactory to the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the local jurisdiction and be&#13;
approved by the State Environmental Commission in the Ministry of Ecology prior to initiating the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-95-&#13;
Annex 6-2&#13;
Page 21 of 24&#13;
Most of the environmental legislation has only recently been put in place and, hence, the&#13;
experience in preparing EAs for gas distribution projects is limited. To assist in coordinating the&#13;
requirements and review by the various jurisdictions, the Ministry of Ecology has established an Inter-&#13;
Ministerial Coordinating Committee and a Center for International Projects designed to expedite projects&#13;
that have foreign investments. The Center is prepared to review the EA at the scoping and early draft&#13;
stage to identify any major deficiencies.&#13;
In order to help familiarize them with World Bank and Federal EA procedures,&#13;
Rosstrojgazifikazia has expressed their preference to employ consultants to assist them in preparing the&#13;
EA which will address the environmental standards of the Russian Federation and the World Bank. It&#13;
is understood that the Ecological Center of International Fuel and Energy enjoys the confidence of both&#13;
the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Ministry of Ecology.&#13;
The EA will describe the existing environment in the vicinity of the project and establish expected&#13;
environmental impacts associated with the undertaking. The environmental advantages and disadvantages&#13;
will be identified and alternatives in project design which may mitigate environmental problems will be&#13;
presented.&#13;
The EA will propose the details of the management of the identified impacts to minimize or&#13;
eliminate them and will set out mitigative and restorative measures that the owner will implement during&#13;
and after construction. The EA will set out a plan to monitor and report on the implementation of these&#13;
measures until the restoration has been successfully implemented.&#13;
The EA will address, as a minimum, the conservation of rare and endangered species, critical&#13;
habits, cultural properties, wetlands and significant environmentally sensitive areas. As well, the EA will&#13;
deal with the Occupational Health and Safety of the construction workforce in accordance with Russian&#13;
legislative and regulatory requirements. The handling and disposal of any hazardous materials associated&#13;
with the undertaking and the provisions to control and clean up any spills of hazardous materials will be&#13;
formulated in the EA.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE - MOFE&#13;
The Development of a Gas Distribution Network Reconstruction Program till 2010&#13;
The Goals: The goals of this Study are to provide the Government with the services in the&#13;
selection of the facilities for the rehabilitation and improvement, in the clarification of its proper sequence&#13;
and financial sources.&#13;
The Current Status: There is an urgent need in the gas distribution networks rehabilitation.&#13;
Meanwhile the regional distribution institutions financial resources are limited. In these circumstances&#13;
it is important to define both the distribution networks that are in greatest need of attention and those&#13;
distribution companies which are able to implement the required reconstruction in most efficient way in&#13;
the current circumstances.&#13;
The Study Scope:  The Consultant will provide the analysis of the status of the majority of&#13;
distribution stock companies as being the potential participants of the Program. The technical conditions&#13;
of the distribution networks, the financial status of the companies, their management, industrial policy&#13;
will be evaluated from the point of view of the selection of the most efficient participants. The consultant&#13;
will propose the recommendation on the preparative measures till the reconstruction starts.&#13;
Task 1.  The analysis of the gas distribution networks technical conditions as well as of the&#13;
organizational, economical and financial conditions for the gas distribution systems reconstruction.&#13;
Task 2. The choice of the key aspects for the improvement and the preparation of the detailed&#13;
recommendations regarding the measures which should be realized till the distribution system&#13;
reconstructions.&#13;
Task 3. The preparation of the Russian gas distribution networks reconstruction draft program till the&#13;
year 2010 including the relevant assessment. This draft will be discussed with Rossgazifikazia, Ministry&#13;
of Fuel and Energy, regional authorities.&#13;
Task 4. The Consultant will finalize the draft program after observation by the Government and the&#13;
regional authorities have been taken into account.&#13;
The Study will address the measures that need to be taken by the Government in support of the&#13;
reconstruction Program. One of the major points to be addressed is to define the temporal and financial&#13;
scopes for the technical assistance of the international institutions in sector development, the means to&#13;
determine when and what should be on the distribution networks reconstruction, the potential for foreign&#13;
investments participation and the role of the companies own funds.&#13;
Tlhe Program has to cover the whole spectrum of the relevant problems including the stimulation&#13;
of the Russian production of the metering equipment, polyethylene pipes and other equipment.&#13;

Development of the Legislation Specification to the Gas Supply&#13;
The Goals: The Study goals are to provide the government with the services in the development&#13;
of new legislation related to the gas sector and the provision of the regulation for the foreign investments&#13;
and financial support to it. The development of the legislative basis for the gas sector is a part of the&#13;
Governmental program of the economical reconstruction.&#13;
The Current Status: Regulation in the gas sector in Russia is evolving. The law "On the natural&#13;
resources" is adopted and the law "On the oil and gas" is under consideration. A decree on the regulation&#13;
of the gas industry was passed in December 1994. Meanwhile a number of existing Russian laws and&#13;
regulations need to be revised or called off as far as they create the obstacles to the gas sector effective&#13;
activity. As a result of the study the draft law "On the gas supply" as well as the proposals on the&#13;
correction of existing laws and regulations have to be developed.  The Study should assist the&#13;
Government in the policy implementation which will help to increase the efficiency in the growing gas&#13;
markets and to guarantee the rights and obligations for the gas producers and gas consumers.&#13;
The Study ScoDe: As a Study result the new legislative basis for the improved gas sector&#13;
efficiency in the developing market relations environment will be created. As expected, the Consultant&#13;
in order to achieve this goal, will implement the main tasks:&#13;
l.    The analysis of the current Russian legislative and regulative frame which forms the basis for the&#13;
business activities in the gas sector. The evaluation of the opportunities for the adaptation in the Russian&#13;
conditions the main legislative and regulative principles acting in the gas industry of the most&#13;
industrialized countries - as USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Norway, Netherlands, etc.&#13;
2.    The formation of the list of those new legislative acts which are required for the efficient gas&#13;
sector activity in the market conditions as well as of those legislative and regulative acts which should&#13;
be reviewed and corrected.  The discussions on the necessity and the directions of the desired&#13;
improvements in the legislation and regulations with the officials of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy,&#13;
Gazprom, Rossgazifikazia, gas producing and gas transporting enterprises.&#13;
3.    The development of the draft law "On gas supply" and on the proposals on the improvements in&#13;
the current legislation, with the contributions from the worldwide practice in this area. Among the main&#13;
subjects to be considered within this draft are: the licenses for the activities in the gas supply, the&#13;
supervision and controls on these activities, the operational procedures in the gas supply management,&#13;
the main requirements to the activities in the gas supply, the design and construction of the relevant&#13;
facilities, the state regulation in this area, the relationships between the gas suppliers, gas distributors and&#13;
gas producers, the involvement of the foreign investments, the responsibilities for the breach of this law&#13;
clauses, etc.&#13;
4.    The discussions on the draft law "On the gas supply" and on the proposals on the improvement&#13;
in the current legislation with the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Gazprom, Rossgazifikazia and their&#13;
presentation before the Russian Government and Parliament.&#13;

Coordination Function on Behalf of the Ministry as Between and Within Each Study&#13;
The Goals: To provide the Govermnent with the services in the management of the Study work&#13;
on each project in this group, for the analysis and acceptance of their results, as well as the provision of&#13;
the Russian side monitoring of the Study implementation.&#13;
The Scope of Services: This assistance is required in order to coordinate the study programs on&#13;
each individual project and to clarify the sequence of their implementation.&#13;
In practice all the technical assistance projects which support the main gas distribution&#13;
rehabilitation credit are interlinked. That is why it is necessary to correspond periodically the results on&#13;
each of them in order that their results and recommendations do not contradict each other. The&#13;
consultants have to clarify the needs of sectoral development and assist in the preparation of these&#13;
supplementary projects which would provide the opportunities for further realization of studies already&#13;
implemented. In some cases, it will be necessary to manage the joint review of the results of a number&#13;
of the interlinked projects. The preparation of such meetings, the formalization of its conclusions and&#13;
the due information of the relevant institutions and projects executors should be done by both Western&#13;
and Russian consultants. It would be required as well to organize the review of the interim and ultimate&#13;
studies results with the Fuel and Energy Ministry, other Governmnental institutions, Rossgazifikazia,&#13;
Gazprom, Regional authorities.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
The implementation plan for the project reflects the capabilities and limitations of the participating&#13;
enterprises and agencies, in terms of the timing and scheduling of activities and the degree of assistance&#13;
required to ensure effective project implementation. It is designed to provide a realistic schedule for the&#13;
engineering, procurement, loan disbursement and installation of the project components based on the&#13;
Bank's prior experience in Russia and the relative inexperience of the participants in project&#13;
implementation. The balance of this Annex outlines the roles and responsibilities of the key personnel&#13;
involved in project implementation, a plan for initial project work, as well as the procurement plan and&#13;
the schedules for implementation of the project components. Annex 6-7 details the Bank's supervision&#13;
schedule, which is coordinated with key implementation milestones. Annex 6-6 details the project&#13;
monitoring and development indicators, which have also been coordinated with the anticipated&#13;
implementation schedule.&#13;
Gas Distribution Component&#13;
The network improvements component of the project will be implemented over four calendar&#13;
years, starting in the third quarter of 1995 through the second quarter of 1999. All components will be&#13;
launched in the first year of the project. A team will be formed to implement the project and will be&#13;
assigned staff with relevant background. A project director will head the team and be supported by&#13;
discipline coordinators. The key discipline coordinators required will be engineering, procurement,&#13;
planning and controls, construction and installation, quality assurance and administration. Considering&#13;
the high educational level of the GDC senior staff and their understanding of the problems faced by the&#13;
companies, the preferred option would be to assign senior staff to the project from within the GDC&#13;
organisation, with the chief engineer of the GDC taking the position of project director. The following&#13;
describes the principal responsibilities for the key personnel.&#13;
Project Director: The project director will have overall responsibility for the implementation of&#13;
the project. The director will report to the general manager of the GDC and have the following primary&#13;
objectives: i) to complete the project on schedule and within the agreed budget; ii) to ensure that the&#13;
quality, safety and environmental standards agreed for the project are understood and adhered to; iii) to&#13;
ensure that all documentation and reports are prepared on time and filed accordingly; and iv) to ensure&#13;
that the implementation team functions as an effective and cohesive group.&#13;
Engineering Coordinator: The engineering coordinator will have responsibility for all aspects of&#13;
the engineering including finalizing the technical specifications for procurement, completing the detailed&#13;
engineering required for the project and preparing detailed installation procedures, drawings, schedules&#13;
and plans. In addition the coordinator will work with the procurement group to finalize the commercial&#13;
sections of the bid packages, provide the basic input for the project schedules and regularly report the&#13;
completion status of the project tasks.&#13;
Procurement Coordinator: The procurement coordinator will be responsible for all aspects of&#13;
local and international procurement including issuing procurement notices, finalizing bid packages, issuing&#13;
bids, receiving proposals, supervising bid openings, evaluations and evaluation reports, preparing and&#13;
issuing purchase contracts. The responsibilities will also include coordinating with quality assurance on&#13;
vendor manufacturing surveillance, expediting and traffic control; arranging customs clearance and inland&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
Annex 6-4&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
transportation where required; receiving inspection reports, warehousing and materials management after&#13;
delivery.  Regular reports will be prepared showing the status of all materials and equipment.&#13;
Planning and Controls Coordinator:    The planning and controls coordinator will be responsible&#13;
for all aspects of project planning, scheduling, cost estimating and cost control. The responsibilities will&#13;
include maintaining and updating the schedules and the cost estimate for completion of the project,&#13;
regularly analysing the project costs to ensure continued financial viability of the project and preparing&#13;
progress reports on the status of the project. Reports to the Bank on the financial aspects of the project&#13;
will be prepared in the standard Bank format. Regular discussions on the progress of the project will&#13;
be held with each coordinator and advice provided to the project director of potential cost or schedule&#13;
impacts.&#13;
Construction and Installation Coordinator: The construction and installation coordinator will be&#13;
responsible for all aspects relating to the construction and installation of the materials and equipment&#13;
associated with the project including preparing schedules and detailed procedures for the installation of&#13;
al] materials and equipment, coordinating the hiring of individuals or contractors for installation and&#13;
supervising the training of these personnel. During the installation period the coordinator would ensure&#13;
that quality, schedule and cost requirements are met and will provide regular reports to the project&#13;
director and the planning and controls coordinator.&#13;
Oualit Assurance (OA) Coordinator: The quality assurance coordinator will be responsible for&#13;
ensuring identifiable goals of quality are met throughout the project implementation. Reporting directly&#13;
to the general director of the GDC the QA coordinator will liaise directly with the project director on all&#13;
project quality related matters.  The responsibilities will include ensuring quality in the engineering,&#13;
procurement and installation of the materials and equipment, engaging 3rd party inspectors to carry out&#13;
inspections of foreign and locally supplied materials where required and coordinating all other material&#13;
inspections.  In addition the quality assurance coordinator will be responsible for ensuring safety is&#13;
maintained at all times on the worksite and also that the environmental mitigation measures are effectively&#13;
carried out.&#13;
Administration Coordinator: The administration coordinator will be responsible for all aspects&#13;
of office administration including office space coordination, secretarial services, office equipment&#13;
coordination, project filing system development and maintenance and project document control.&#13;
Note: It should be noted that all the coordinators described above may not necessarily be&#13;
dedicated full time to work on the implementation of this project. For example the planning and controls&#13;
coordinator could come from the existing accounting department and may have other responsibilities also.&#13;
Similarly the quality assurance coordinator may be responsible for quality throughout the GDC. On the&#13;
other hand coordinators such as the engineering, procurement  and construction and installation&#13;
coordinators will be dedicated full time to the project and each may have several people working for&#13;
them.&#13;
Technical Assistance to the GDC: Considering the GDC's lack of experience with international&#13;
and Bank procedures, especially with regard to finance and procurement, it is proposed that consultant&#13;
support services be provided under the proposed loan. The selected consultants should be conversant&#13;
with both Russian and Bank practices and should have the backing or support capabilities to carry out&#13;
their work effectively.  It is expected that the consultants will travel to, and remain in, Volgograd&#13;
working with the implementation team on an as required basis. The consulting teamn will include the&#13;
following skill mix:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-&#13;
Annex 64&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
(a)    Two consultants specializing in gas distribution will support the technical areas: the first, a gas&#13;
distribution specialist, with expertise in design and implementation of all aspects of gas distribution&#13;
networks will provide advice on project implementation to the project director and the technical groups.&#13;
The other, a gas metering design specialist, with expertise in metering design and specification, will be&#13;
required on a short-term basis only to assist the engineering group.&#13;
(b)    A  procurement specialist will advise the procurement group in all aspects of the procurement&#13;
process and also will recommend institutional changes to strengthen the GDC's capability to procure from&#13;
local sources and abroad.&#13;
(c)    A financial analyst will assist the planning and controls group and the GDC financial managers&#13;
in establishing project accounting procedures, in facilitating the preparation of financial statements that&#13;
conform to international standards, and in providing general financial advice to the GDCs.&#13;
(d)    An independent 3rd party inspection company will be engaged to provide factory inspections for&#13;
materials and equipment.  As most of the equipment is standard and not engineered products the&#13;
requirement for this service is expected to be small.&#13;
In view of the urgency, it is proposed that requests for proposals for consultants under (a), (b)&#13;
and (c) above be issued as soon as loan negotiations have been concluded. The cost of the specialists&#13;
is estimated at US$1.5 million. The twinning arrangements proposed under the technical assistance&#13;
component of the project would complement the activities of the consultants. In view of the timing and&#13;
the fact that the utilities executing the twinning arrangements may also lack experience in Bank&#13;
procedures, the twinning is not seen, however, as a substitute for technical assistance.&#13;
In addition to the technical assistance financed by the Bank the GDCs may require assistance from&#13;
local consultants in the following areas:&#13;
(a)    A local procurement agent may be required to provide assistance in such areas as local&#13;
procurement, customs clearance for inported materials and local transportation of materials.&#13;
(b)    Assistance from a local engineering institute may be required to prepare the detailed installation&#13;
procedures and drawings as these institutes have been doing this work in the past.&#13;
Energy Efficiency Component&#13;
RESF would be responsible for evaluating, overseeing, and administering onlending for the&#13;
energy efficiency components of the project. During the first year, the energy efficiency projects will&#13;
be restricted to three of the four cities visited during appraisal (Volgograd, Ryazan and Saratov) plus St&#13;
Petersburg. In the following year, the geographic scope will be extended to include Nizhni-Novgorod,&#13;
Samara, Rostov-on-the-Don, Stavropol, and Vladimir. Pending the findings of a mid-term review, limits&#13;
on the geographic scope of the project could be lifted for the remaining years and for projects financed&#13;
through reflows.&#13;
The responsibilities of RESF will include: (a) the review and approval of detailed sub-project&#13;
procurement needs (prepared by the district heating companies and local power plants); (b) review and&#13;
approval of the execution plan for procurement activities, review of the economic and financial rates of&#13;
return and of the financial viability of the borrower; (c) control and review of the technical and financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-106-&#13;
Annex 6-4&#13;
Page 4 of 13&#13;
aspects of sub-project implementation; and (d) review of the environmental assessment of the sub-&#13;
projects. Based on their review, the RESF staff will submit qualifying sub-projects to a loan review&#13;
committee, which will include the agency's board, supplemented by representation from the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. The review committee will be authorized to approve projects requiring loans up to US$1&#13;
million. Projects requiring loans of more than US$1 million, as well as the first two projects in each&#13;
service area, will be submitted to the Bank for final review and approval. A separate group will be&#13;
established within the RESF to implement the energy efficiency component of the project. During the&#13;
initial phases of the project, RESF will be assisted in both project evaluation and implementation by&#13;
consultants to be financed under the institution strengthening component of technical assistance.&#13;
Two sources of financing will be made available under the project to assist RESF: (a) the spread&#13;
between the Bank lending rate and the onlending rate will include 0.5 percent to cover their administrative&#13;
costs; and, (b) part of the proposed GEF project on greenhouse gas reduction will be used to finance the&#13;
costs of establishing this unit. It is proposed that the debt servicing payments by the executing agencies&#13;
be made as two separate components - one of 0.5 percent to RESF and the other to the Government,&#13;
excluding the 0.5 percent spread designed to cover RESF's administrative costs. This would provide an&#13;
incentive for RESF to undertake an effective follow-up on repayments. The RESF will submit cash flow&#13;
and income statements on a quarterly basis, detailing how their income was spent. Ministry of Finance&#13;
will be responsible for managing repayment of the subsidiary loans. The advisability of their contracting&#13;
this task to an agency bank will be discussed during negotiations.&#13;
The primary criteria for the viability of sub-projects will be: (a) an economic rate of return of&#13;
not less than 20 percent (real); (b) a financial rate of return of not less than 10 percent (real); (c) a&#13;
demonstrated ability on the part of the ultimate borrower to finance the local portion of project costs from&#13;
internally generated funds; (d) the technical feasibility of the proposal; (e) the proposed implementation&#13;
plan; (f) a debt service ratio of at least 1.2 to demonstrate the ability, on the part of the borrower, to&#13;
repay the loan to the Ministry of Finance; and, (g) an environmental assessment which meets Russian&#13;
requirements.&#13;
Technical Assistance Component&#13;
The components of the technical assistance related to project implementation, that is, the&#13;
assistance to the project implementation teams in the GDC and the training and technical support to the&#13;
RESF, will be implemented by the beneficiary agencies. The studies proposed for financing under the&#13;
loan will be implemented by the Department for Gasification and Gas Industry of the MOFE. The&#13;
proposed technical assistance includes a component for assistance to the MOFE in overall study co-&#13;
ordination, which will provide support to the ministry's implementation efforts. It has also been proposed&#13;
that the MOFE delegate implementation responsibility for the study to upgrade and internationalize the&#13;
technical gas standards and procedures to Rossgazifikazia, based on the latter's skills and interests in this&#13;
subject.&#13;
Implementation Schedules&#13;
Gas Distribution Component: The draft schedule for the implementation process is shown on&#13;
pages 6 and 7 of this Annex. This schedule outlines the activities which must be started in the first year&#13;
of implementation.  Implementation of the project was advanced during the Loan negotiations by&#13;
reviewing draft tender documents.  The first activity will be the selection of consultants for&#13;
implementation assistance. The Terms of Reference and Letter of Invitation has been finalized and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-&#13;
Annex 6-4&#13;
Page 5 of 13&#13;
be issued as soon as possible so that a contract can be signed and the selected consultanms can mobilise&#13;
shortly after the loan is made effective. At the same time the procurement process for materials and&#13;
equipment has been initiated with the drafting of a General Procurement Notice. The technical&#13;
specifications and bidding documents need to be finalised so that tenders can be issued shortly after the&#13;
loan is made effective and the consultants for implementation assistance are mobilised.  (Note: Draft&#13;
Technical Specifications and TOR for consultants have been prepared during project preparation). Issue&#13;
of the tender documents in the third quarter of 1995 is essential if contracts are to be awarded and&#13;
disbursements made in 1996. The other activity which must start soon after negotiation is the&#13;
determination of exactly how much engineering work is required by the GDC, how will that work be&#13;
carried out and arranging the resources to carry out the engineering. In addition the GDCs must start&#13;
the detailed planning of how the construction and installation of the materials and equipment will take&#13;
place.&#13;
Summary schedules for the components are shown on pages 8 through 10 and the Procurement Plan and&#13;
Schedule on Page 1l. These schedules show that the major components of meters, cathodic protection&#13;
and SCADA would require 3 to 4 years to be fully implemented.  More detailed schedules for each&#13;
component will be required as implementation progresses.  These will be prepared by the project&#13;
implementation teams within the first 6 months of the project.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Energv Efficiency Components: Page 1 1 shows the planned schedule&#13;
for implementation of the technical assistance components of the project. All of the Technical Assistance&#13;
items will be started in the first year of implementation. Finally, page 12 shows the proposed schedule&#13;
for the initial phases of implementation of the energy efficiency component. Beyond the initial phases,&#13;
however, the schedule will depend on the rate at which qualifying subprojects are submitted for appraisal&#13;
to the RESF.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
1.    The Bank has determined that this project requires a "category B" Environmental Mitigation Plan&#13;
(EMP), as defined in the Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment, O.D. 4.01.&#13;
2.    The Russian Federation environmental requirements are outlined in the Environmental Assessment&#13;
Manual, 1992, which implements RSFSR Law on Environmental Protection, no. 2060-1, adopted&#13;
December 19, 1991. According to RSFSR Law on Environmental Protection No. 2060-1, adopted 19&#13;
December, 1991, Section V, Articles 36, 37, and Section VI, Articles 40,42 and 43, and Environmental&#13;
Assessment is required for this project under the category of "rebuilding of facilities." According to the&#13;
Environmental Assessment Manual, updated in 1992, ecological and other related implications of a project&#13;
must be considered in "remodeling or technically refurbishing" facilities. An EMP is also required if&#13;
foreign equipment is introduced. The environmental analysis is subject to review by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources.&#13;
3.    After approval of the loan, site specific engineering will be undertaken in order to determine&#13;
parameters of each project. The engineering phase will result in recommendations for locations of pipe&#13;
replacement and specific amounts of pipe to be replaced. Locations for implementation of cathodic&#13;
protection will be determined after new leak detection equipment is in place and a survey of the system&#13;
has been completed. Specifications for the SCADA system will be developed, required RTU and meters&#13;
for the industrial and commercial customers will be identified and suppliers selected after evaluation of&#13;
competitive bids is completed.&#13;
4.    The engineering phase will also result in development of specifications for installations of burners,&#13;
controls, BTU meters, control values for district heating systems and district heating plant modifications,&#13;
and specifications of similar equipment as well as heat recovery systems for the industrial plant energy&#13;
conservation projects.&#13;
5.    Subsequent EMPs will be prepared by each of the three cities on the specific gas distribution&#13;
system projects. These EMPs will be reviewed by the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Ministry of&#13;
the Environment and Natural Resources and by other agencies as appropriate.&#13;
6.    During preparation of the EMP, discussions took place with representatives of the Environmental&#13;
Committees and occupational safety officials in the three cities as well as representatives of the Ministry&#13;
of Fuel and Energy and the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. Their interests and&#13;
concerns were incorporated in the EMP.&#13;
7.    The beneficial impacts of the project include reduced methane leak potential and potential for gas&#13;
conservation. These are discussed in greater detail below.&#13;
8.    Reduced Methane Leak Potential: Replacement of deteriorated pipes, installations of a cathodic&#13;
protection system and new testing equipment will reduce the potential of gas leaks and result in two&#13;
impacts:&#13;
*     Increase in public safety by reducing the risk of explosion due to undetected leaks;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-117-&#13;
Annex 6-5&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
*     A cumulative beneficial impact resulting from the reduced potential for release of methane to the&#13;
atmosphere, thus reducing the greenhouse effect. Since methane emissions produce a greenhouse&#13;
signal that is 20 to 50 times greater than carbon dioxide for equivalent emissions, it is the second&#13;
most significant greenhouse gas being emitted by man's activities.&#13;
9.    Potential for Gas Conservation: Increased efficiency in the delivery of gas through the reduction&#13;
in the potential for leaks, through pipe replacement, cathodic protection and new testing equipment, better&#13;
system controls through installation of SCADA, and the combination of upgrading and new metering and&#13;
a change in pricing policy will result in gas conservation. This will make more natural gas available to&#13;
accommodate future population growth. As market forces create a greater external demand for gas at&#13;
higher prices, increased sales made possible by conservation of gas will result in an increase in an&#13;
economic benefit to the Russian economy.&#13;
10.   As a result of implementing the gas conservation projects (district heating and industrial plants),&#13;
the total yearly emissions of NOx. would be reduced by 1,064 tons and C02 emissions would be reduced&#13;
by 83,621 tons. These are considered to be beneficial projects.&#13;
11.   The potential adverse impacts of the project are the following:&#13;
-     Construction Impacts--Pipeline replacement will result in short term construction related impacts.&#13;
This will include traffic circulation, air quality, odor, soil erosion, water quality, fish movement,&#13;
noise and public safety risks.&#13;
-     Traffic Circulation and Other Public Activities--a potential temporary disruption of traffic&#13;
movement.&#13;
-     Air Quality--dust during clearing and grading activities, during trench digging and while moving&#13;
soil.&#13;
-     Odor--gas venting will result in odor near blowdown sites. The duration of detectable odor in&#13;
these cases is usually from a few minutes to an hour.&#13;
-     Soil erosion-in hilly areas there would be a potential for increase in soil erosion as a result of&#13;
the pipe replacement activities.&#13;
-     Water quality--if oil degraded pipes are not removed and disposed of properly at river crossings,&#13;
this could result in degradation of water quality.&#13;
-     Barrier to Fish Movement-trenching in the rivers may result in a temporary barrier to fish&#13;
movement.&#13;
-     Construction Noise-trucks, bulldozers, and welding equipment will be required for grading,&#13;
trenching, pipe laying, and back-filling. These pieces of equipment produce noise levels of 70-85&#13;
dBA at a distance of about 50 feet.&#13;
-     Increased Public Safety Risks-the old pipes that will be removed will be purged of gas and then&#13;
removed. There is a potential for public safety risks from normal construction operations.&#13;
12.   Mitigation measures that need to be taken are the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-118-&#13;
Annex 6-5&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
a)    Construction Mitigation Measures for Pipe Replacement-- Protection of other Utilities--prior to&#13;
construction, the location of other utilities underground and above ground in the vicinity of the pipe must&#13;
be identified and permits from local authorities obtained. During construction, all the other utility lines&#13;
must be protected. Each utility should remain in full operation during construction. All ditches must&#13;
be returned to their original condition or better.&#13;
b)     Construction Safety-- In addition to the World Bank Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines,&#13;
Russian Federation Requirements will be adhered to as follows:&#13;
*  Instructions of SNiP 2.04.08-87: "Gas Supply" and "Safety Rules for Maintenance of Gas&#13;
Utilities ";&#13;
*  Russian Federation Health and Safety Regulations in the Gas Industry, 20 October, 1991;&#13;
*  Norms for Safety in Construction Industry, 1991;&#13;
*  Safety Rules and Norms in the Construction Industry. Noise Protection, July 1, 1978;&#13;
*  Federal Standard GOST 12.1.003-83&#13;
*  SNiP 2.05.06-85, Section 9, Environmental Protection for Pipelines;&#13;
*  SNiP 3.05.02-88, Building Code Gas Supply;&#13;
*  The State Committee for Safe Performance Supervision in Industrial and Mining Sectors, Safety&#13;
Rules in Gas Industry;&#13;
*  GosGor TechNadzor, Safe Operation of Reservoirs which are under pressure;&#13;
3  RosStroysGas, Operations, Regulations in Gas Industry, Health and Safety Regulations, July 1,&#13;
1992.&#13;
Each city has its own occupational safety regulations. Construction procedures should be in conformance&#13;
with all city regulations that apply.&#13;
c) Construction Procedures:&#13;
* Research of Pipelines--no excavation should be undertaken until detailed research of the existing&#13;
underground structures is completed by a qualified pipeline engineering concern.&#13;
* Pot holing--pot holing is the advance digging by hand to locate underground structures. Pot&#13;
holing should be used whenever it is necessary to locate the position of underground structures.&#13;
* Protection of Existing Drainage Patterns-at stream or river crossings, new pipeline should be&#13;
buried at least 3 meters under the scour line.&#13;
* Erosion control--in hilly areas where there is a potential for erosion, an erosion control plan&#13;
should be prepared.&#13;
* Dust Control--the construction area should be sprayed with water to control dust.&#13;
* Construction Noise--prior to venting of gas as part of pipe replacement operations notice should&#13;
be given to surrounding area residents and commercial and industrial establishments. Construction&#13;
activities should take place only during the daytime, and should conform to city noise ordinances and&#13;
regulations, as applicable.&#13;
* Treatment of Removed Old Pipes--the old pipes that will be removed should be purged of all gas&#13;
and then removed. Pipes that are abandoned in place should be cut, capped, and filled with inert&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-&#13;
Annex 6-5&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
nitrogen gas to eliminate future risks.&#13;
* Water Quality--the hydrostatic test water should be drawn from nearby sources, pressurized in&#13;
the pipe, tested for contamination, and then discharged to an existing waterway.&#13;
* Solid Waste-all solid waste generated at the construction site should be removed from the site&#13;
and deposited at an approved solid waste disposal facility.&#13;
* Toxic Soil--The potential for the presence of toxic materials in the soil should be investigated&#13;
prior to construction, and construction activities should be carried out according to the best practices&#13;
of health and environmental safety.&#13;
* Construction Inspectors--the gas utility in each city should designate inspectors to perform regular&#13;
inspections of construction activities to ensure that the contractors are following proper construction&#13;
procedures.&#13;
e Fire Protection and Emergency Response-an emergency response should be prepared for the&#13;
project prior to construction.&#13;
3 Continuation of Vehicular Circulation--vehicular circulation should not be disrupted during&#13;
construction.&#13;
* Vehicular Safety During Construction on the Road and on the Construction Site--all Federal and&#13;
local laws dealing with vehicle safety during construction should be adhered to.&#13;
* Future Maintenance--future maintenance activities should be undertaken on a regular basis as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* Periodic checks of cathodic protection equipment to ensure proper operation and effectiveness of&#13;
corrosion protection; maintain active participation by other agencies to ensure that notice is given&#13;
by them prior to excavating in the vicinity of the gas system pipe; leak surveys; maintenance of&#13;
valves, regulators, and metering devices according to regular schedule.&#13;
Mitigating Measures Monitoring:&#13;
a)    Public involvement during project implementation should be conducted as part of the project for&#13;
the residential and the commercial establishments that would be affected by the short term construction&#13;
impacts of the project.&#13;
b)    Monitoring of the implementation of mitigation measures should occur before, during and after&#13;
the pipe replacement has taken place. Monitoring should encompass all the mitigation measures required&#13;
as conditions of the project to ensure that they have been properly executed. Monitoring should be the&#13;
responsibility of the Environmental Coordinator.&#13;
In order to ensure that the project mitigation plan is executed effectively, the environmental management&#13;
capability of Volgograd Gorgas should be enhanced. Organizational changes should be instituted as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* A new position of Environmental Coordinator should be established within each gas utility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120-&#13;
Annex 6-5&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
company.&#13;
*  A staff development program for environmental compliance should be instituted&#13;
* Technical Assistance Program designed to keep the newly appointed Environmental Coordinator&#13;
current with developments in the environmental field&#13;
* Equipment Support for Environmental Management to support the environmental coordinator and&#13;
the personnel in the Environmental Committees. Various types of equipment should be supplied&#13;
to assist them in their work. Equipment considered are computers, including environmental and&#13;
gas distribution standards and procedures translated into Russian, fax machines, noise meters, and&#13;
air filters.&#13;
c)    Implementation responsibilities of the training program will be the responsibility of the GDC.&#13;
Areas of training would include:&#13;
m A counterpart coordinator will be designated in the foreign GDC to supervise training activities&#13;
there. This coordinator will be responsible for implementation of the program as planned. Each&#13;
trainee will have a mentor for the duration of the training. The mentor will be responsible for&#13;
follow-up, guidance, and support to the trainee while he/she is abroad.&#13;
* One person will be designated for training. This person will spend a total of three months&#13;
abroad. The first month will be spent during the engineering phase, in the first 6 months of the&#13;
project. The second month will be spent just prior to start of construction. The third month will be&#13;
spent after construction is completed.&#13;
Cost mitigation strategies are as follows:&#13;
a)    No additional costs are expected for construction mitigation measures because the best engineering&#13;
and construction practices would incorporate all of the measures recommended above as part of the&#13;
project cost. The cost of the public involvement program would be included in the project specific EMPs&#13;
to be prepared at a later phase.&#13;
b)    The total cost of the mitigation program would be $205,000, consisting of about $40,000 per year&#13;
for the environmental management program, $115,000 for the environmental training program, and&#13;
$50,000 for equipment.&#13;

GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS&#13;
During project implementation a number of key indicators will be reviewed to ensure that the&#13;
project's objectives are explicitly monitored and controlled. The key areas of concem under the project&#13;
are that: (i) the financial viability of the borrowing enterprise is maintained; (ii) projected energy savings&#13;
take place; (iii) access to information increases to enable improved network design; and, (iv) project costs&#13;
are minimized. The following outlines the key variables that will be assessed and how the information&#13;
will be dealt with which are summarized in the table below.&#13;

Financial Viability&#13;
The key areas of concern regarding financial viability of the enterprises relate to self-financing&#13;
capability, debt servicing capability and the level of accounts receivable relative to sales.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-122-&#13;
Annex 6-6&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
Each October, the utility will furnish a budget for the next fiscal year, indicating how the&#13;
proposed self-financing ratio covenant will be met to ensure that local costs can be financed from&#13;
internally generated funds. The analysis will focus on prices and production costs to ensure that&#13;
appropriate actions are taken to meet the project objectives.&#13;
Within three months of the end of each fiscal year, Volgograd Gorgas will furnish a copy of its&#13;
audited financial statements to the Bank for review. This review will focus on the profitability of the&#13;
enterprise and ensure that no new debt is undertaken that would undermine its debt service capability.&#13;
It will also focus on the return to shareholder's capital, so that the transition to a successful independent&#13;
joint stock company can be realized.&#13;
The accounts receivable situation is the current primary concern in the energy sector. Hence,&#13;
monthly summaries (which would later become quarterly summaries once they have been proven to be&#13;
successfully dealt with) of the status of this variable will be reviewed. Specific actions on debt swaps&#13;
and cutting-back/off supply to non-payers will be reviewed during supervision missions.&#13;
Energy Savings&#13;
The project includes two components that are expected to result in energy savings - induced&#13;
reduction of gas use from metering and investments in equipment that will decrease energy consumption.&#13;
The reported gas savings from similar metering projects in Russia has ranged from 25 to 50 percent.&#13;
Therefore, data will be collected on gas consumption during the early stages of meter implementation to&#13;
establish baseline data. Monthly records will then be kept for a period of about two years (to establish&#13;
the effect of seasonality on consumption) to determine the impact of metering on household gas&#13;
consumption.&#13;
Investments in energy savings (burners, controls, boilers) will be assessed to determine the impact&#13;
of these investments on energy efficiency. If some of these investments are shown to have particularly&#13;
high impacts, RESF will attempt to have similar investments implemented in other cities.&#13;
Access to Information&#13;
Under the gas distribution rehabilitation component, the GDC will have improved access to&#13;
information as a result of the SCADA system. The combination of this information and network analysis&#13;
tools is expected to enable their staff to better design investments in system upgrades. The leak detection&#13;
equipment will also provide better information on fugitive methane emissions. This information, coupled&#13;
with the implementation of cathodic protection, will enable the GDC staff to identify problem areas in&#13;
their network which need to be addressed. This information will be collected to determine the best way&#13;
in which the cathodic protection system should be implemented and will enable the GDCs to assign&#13;
priorities for pipe replacement.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
Uncertainties with respect to project costs will be explicitly dealt with during project&#13;
implementation. One of the key questions that will be addressed is the ability of Russian suppliers to&#13;
compete under Bank-financed ICB. If barriers to entry are identified, an assessment of these barriers will&#13;
be undertaken to determine how they might be overcome.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
I.    This Annex outlines the assumptions used in the financial analysis of the project, and details the&#13;
findings of the assessment of the financial internal rates of return.&#13;
A.    Financial Rate of Return - Metering&#13;
2.     Gas distribution companies would benefit financially from the meter installation program only&#13;
through more accurate measurement of quantities purchased and sold. More accurate measurement has&#13;
two potential impacts: first, it will eliminate the under-reading of industrial sales and purchases that is&#13;
currently experienced as a result of the age of the meters; and secondly, it will help to reduce or&#13;
eliminate the "losses" now incurred as a result of billing by norms. (The GDCs purchases from Gazprom&#13;
are metered, but sales to residential and un-metered commercial customers are estimated based on the&#13;
norms. The sum of the quantities purchased and quantities billed do not always match.)&#13;
3.    In estimating the benefits of metering, it was assumed that meters would eliminate the losses now&#13;
incurred as a result of billing commercial customers based on norms. It was also assumed that, once&#13;
the meters were installed, commercial customers would reduce their consumption to the level of the&#13;
norms. Hence commercial sales volumes would remain unchanged (except for projected changes in the&#13;
demand forecast), but the gas purchased to supply these needs would decline by the level of estimated&#13;
"losses". Current commercial losses as a percent of commercial sales were estimated by the consultants&#13;
as being 0. 1 percent for Volgograd Gorgas.&#13;
4.    In the industrial sector, financial benefits were based on the premise that existing meters are&#13;
under-reading both sales and purchases by 1 to 2 percent. The benefits calculation assumed that more&#13;
accurate metering would result in an increase in sales and purchases equal to 1 percent of current and&#13;
projected industrial sales.&#13;
5.     For residential customers, it was originally anticipated that metering would yield benefits similar&#13;
to those in the commercial sector - although to a much greater degree since norms were judged to be&#13;
significantly less than actual consumption. However, the norms for residential gas usage have recently&#13;
been increased to as much as double their previous levels. This increase should effectively eliminate most&#13;
discrepancies between the amounts billed and the amounts consumed. Consequently, the installation of&#13;
residential meters was assumed to yield no financial benefit to the utilities.&#13;
6.     Other assumptions relating to the calculation of FIRR on the metering component of the projects&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
Retail gas prices (constant 1993 price levels, excluding VAT):&#13;
Commercial, industrial                           US$40 per MCM by December, 1995&#13;
Residential                                      US$40 per MCM by December, 1997&#13;
Retail margins (% of purchase price):&#13;
Commercial, industrial                                    13.9%&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Residential                                            455.6%&#13;
Capital Cost of Projects:&#13;
As per cost estimate (expressed in 1993 price levels) plus 5 percent duties on foreign currency&#13;
components. Grant financing under the Global Environment Facility was deducted from the&#13;
capital costs to determine FIRRs of the implementing agencies.&#13;
Installation of Meters:&#13;
In accordance with cost estimates for each utility&#13;
7.    The table on pages 4 shows the calculation of FIRR on the metering component of the project&#13;
for Volgograd Gorgas. The estimated FIRR is 12.3 percent.&#13;
B     Financial Rate of Return - Metering with Rental Charge&#13;
8.    Clearly, the metering component of the project is not financially viable from the perspective of&#13;
the Gorgas under the base assumptions with regard to prices. While the potential economic benefits are&#13;
substantial in terms of induced conservation and consequent freeing up of gas for export, financial&#13;
returns to the gas distribution company are minimal and insufficient to support the investment required.&#13;
Possible approaches to resolving this problem include:  (a) recovering part and/or all of the meters'&#13;
costs through a demand charge and/or through direct customer contributions; or (ii) setting gas prices&#13;
based on a defined return on assets.&#13;
9.     Under the first alternative, customer charges or contributions would have to cover a substantial&#13;
proportion of meter capital costs. Assuming that on-lending to the gas distribution companies is at a&#13;
nominal rate of 10 percent, repayable in foreign currency, financial returns on the project would have&#13;
to be in the order of 7.5 percent in real terms simply to cover borrowing costs. Allowing for a return&#13;
on equity of 15 percent, and assuming a long-term capital structure of 60:40 debt/equity, a minimum real&#13;
FIRR requirement would be in the order of 10 percent. To achieve a 10 percent FIRR on the metering&#13;
component of the project, Volgograd Gorgas would have to recover 92 percent of the capital costs of the&#13;
meters from their customers. Given that the unit costs for meters are estimated to be US$90 for private&#13;
homes, US$840 for conmmercial customers, US$500 for apartment blocks (which would serve&#13;
approximately 10 customers each), and US$17,000 for industrial meters, an attempt to finance the&#13;
meters through up-front customer contributions is constrained by customer ability to pay.&#13;
10.   Alternatively, the Gorgas could impose a demand charge which would recover the financial cost&#13;
of the meters (including a 10 percent return on investment) over a more extended period. Recovering&#13;
the full cost of the meters over 10 years would require monthly demand charges as shown in the table&#13;
below. If the Gorgas were to recover only that percentage of meter cost required to yield an overall 10&#13;
percent return on the investment (i.e. 92 percent on average), demand charges would be reduced&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
&#13;

Annually                    Monthly&#13;
Commercial                                       $138.00                      $11.40&#13;
Private Homes                                     $14.65                       $1.20&#13;
Apartment Blocks (per unit)                        $8.15                       $0.70&#13;
Industrial                                      $2,767.00                    $230.60&#13;
11.   To place these demand charges in perspective, residential norms for cooking plus water heating&#13;
(typical of an apartment unit) are in the order of 85 m3 per month which, at US$40.00 per MCM would&#13;
suggest an energy charge of US$3.40. The demand charge would therefore represent roughly a 20&#13;
percent increase in the monthly bill. For private homes, which are likely to also use gas for heating,&#13;
norms would be in the order of 600 m3 per month, giving a projected monthly energy charge of&#13;
US$24.00. The demand charge of US$1.20 represents only a 5 percent increase in the monthly bill.&#13;
The charges are also moderate relative to incomes, as average monthly incomes are approaching&#13;
US$200, and total household incomes are therefore presumably approaching an average in the order of&#13;
US$300-400/month.&#13;
12.   Assuming that the meter rental charges are set to fully recover the capital costs of meters and&#13;
meter installation (assuming a capital recovery requirement of 10 percent/10 years), the FIRR on the&#13;
meter component of the project would rise to 14.5 percent. The table on page 5 provides details of these&#13;
calculations.&#13;
C.    Financial Rate of Return - Network Improvements&#13;
13.   Financial returns to Volgograd Gorgas as a result of investments in network improvements&#13;
(cathodic protection, SCADA, network analysis tools) will accrue from the same sources as the economic&#13;
returns; that is, a combination of deferred pipe replacement, reductions in investment requirements, and&#13;
reductions in electricity costs.&#13;
14.   For the financial analysis, the cost of pipe replacement was estimated to be US$114 per meter.&#13;
This presumes that Russian prices for materials would be equal to international prices, but that prices for&#13;
local services and labor would be only 40 percent of international prices.&#13;
C.,&#13;
15.   Annual savings in pipe replacement were calculated as the difference between replacing the full&#13;
network over a 20 year period and replacing it over 60 years. In addition, the use of more sophisticated&#13;
network analysis tools was assumed to add an additional benefit equal to 10 percent of this saving.&#13;
Annual savings in electricity costs were based on consultant estimates of savings in kWh consumed, and&#13;
an electricity cost of US$65.00 per MW.h.&#13;
16.   Page 6 summarizes the assumptions of the financial analysis for the network improvement&#13;
components of the project, and shows the estimated FIRR. Financial returns on this component are&#13;
estimated at 34.9 percent.&#13;

GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND&#13;
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT&#13;
RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Projects in Russia, in general, face a considerable degree of risk. Many of the risks are&#13;
attributable to the uncertainties associated with the stability of the macroeconomic environment. In&#13;
addition, project specific risks include uncertainties on equipment and installation costs and the&#13;
effectiveness of the equipment. As the newly formed joint stock companies have acquired new&#13;
responsibilities and reporting requirements (to their shareholders), some initial problems will arise&#13;
affecting their ability to perform effectively.&#13;
2.     As a result of the potential impacts of these uncertainties, a risk analysis was undertaken with&#13;
a goal of managing these risks to avoid unacceptable project returns. The process of determining a&#13;
risk mitigation strategy consisted of the following steps:&#13;
(1)    establish a risk list based on a brain-storming session with technical, economic, and financial&#13;
specialists experienced in similar projects;&#13;
(2)    establish a risk mitigation list of possible remedies that would address the risks identified in&#13;
(1);&#13;
(3)    model the stochastic nature of project implementation without the risk mitigation to determine&#13;
the expected rate of return and its probability distribution;&#13;
(4)    analyze the impact of each of the risk mitigation strategies to determine the impact on&#13;
expected returns and its variance;&#13;
(5)    formulate a risk mitigation strategy based on an analysis of the costs and expected benefits of&#13;
the proposed risk actions.&#13;
Risks&#13;
-Rik List .. .     3.      The risk list compiled identified a set of key risks indicated in&#13;
Table 1. The primary risks are associated with the cost of the&#13;
Equipment Quantity  equipment and the expected value of the benefits. The equipment costs&#13;
Equipment UnitCt        are subject to a number of uncertainties.  The most likely costs assume&#13;
Equiipment Unit Costs   standard foreign costs based on the assumption that Russian costs will&#13;
Output Prices        approach foreign costs (or greater) as input subsidies are reduced,&#13;
Energy Savings       based on experience in Central Europe. However, Russian supplied&#13;
Investment Plan       equipment could remain low if manufacturers take advantage of low&#13;
Russian labor costs while upgrading equipment quality to meet&#13;
international standards. There is a possibility this scenario could take&#13;
place as a number of foreign manufacturers have either established joint ventures or they are actively&#13;
pursuing this option. Equipment costs could also decrease if equipment is supplied from another&#13;
country whose labor costs are low, as has been the experience on other similar projects. Installation&#13;
costs could also be less than that assumed if the Gas Distribution Companies (GDCs) increase&#13;
productivity. This may happen as a result of their becoming joint stock companies and based on&#13;
guidance from their foreign partner. Some productivity gains could be initiated by reducing the size&#13;
of the teams responsible for construction. The quantity of equipment required could also vary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

depending on the evolution of the gas market. Some companies could go bankrupt, and no longer&#13;
need the equipment. However, new companies may require gas supply as investments take place.&#13;
Migration would also have an affect on the size of the market and, hence, the equipment needs.&#13;
4.    The project benefits are a function of a number of assumptions that are fraught with&#13;
uncertainty. The pace of the price reform program has an affect on the value of the benefits and&#13;
market size (as energy efficiency responses take place). The size of the market is a function of many&#13;
assumptions on the reform program, including economic growth and the structure of the economy.&#13;
Not only is there uncertainty with respect to the nature of the reforms, but also the rate at which they&#13;
are implemented.&#13;
5.     The size of the benefits associated with energy savings depends on the effectiveness of the&#13;
equipment, systems design and equipment maintenance. The "most likely" case represents a&#13;
conservative estimate of the benefits, to compensate for potential implementation problems and poor&#13;
maintenance. However, as companies are privatized, the incentives to succeed will mitigate this&#13;
problem.&#13;
6.    The benefits of the asset life extension component are also uncertain. The consultant&#13;
responsible for project preparation assessed the benefits from this program to represent 10 percent of&#13;
the investment program costs based on experience abroad. However, based on the system design in&#13;
Russia, the consultant estimated that these benefits could be as high as 15 percent of the investment&#13;
program. In addition to this fundamental assessment of the potential benefits of asset life extension&#13;
are the uncertainties inherent in the investment program itself, including the amount of equipment&#13;
required and the unit costs of this equipment.&#13;
Risk Mitigation Actions                                              Risk MIitigiation List&#13;
7.     Given that the project is subject to many uncertainties, project  Pr* Refo&#13;
design and proposed implementation were formulated to reduce the risk   nrice Reform&#13;
of achieving unsatisfactory financial returns. Given that the economic  Institutonal Reform&#13;
returns are robust, and that the GDCs have become joint stock         Training/Twinning&#13;
companies with 51 percent private ownership, it was determined that   Phased Procurement&#13;
the analysis should focus on financial returns.                       Financial Covenants&#13;
Gas Market Analysis&#13;
8.     Most of the managers of the GDCs visited expressed concern     Procurerent Review&#13;
about the financial viability of the investments given the uncertainties&#13;
on price reform. The project design requires prices to industrial&#13;
customers (all customers except households) to reach US$40/MCM by&#13;
the end of 19951, when investments are expected to start to be commissioned. This risk has been&#13;
addressed by the following approach. Project processing has been contingent upon continued price&#13;
reform. The price increases during 1993, particularly the decree in July 1993 which increased&#13;
industrial prices and linked monthly adjustments to inflation, made project processing feasible as the&#13;
Government made its commitment to price reform clear. Continued process of gas prices has been a&#13;
condition of Board presentation.&#13;
1 The project financial benefits are not directly a function of price as the GDCs revenues are a function of&#13;
the differential between the purchase price from Gazprom and the selling price to the customer. However, the&#13;
Government has linked wholesale and retail price increases. Therefore, the margin associated with a&#13;
US$40/MCM of about US$5.00/MCM is the price objective for the GDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-138-&#13;
Annex 8-2&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
9.     Further measures in continued price reform are dealt with through the financial covenants.&#13;
The design of the covenants are based on three principles: (a) adequate internal cash generation to&#13;
fully finance local costs; (b) adequate internal cash generation to maintain a debt service ratio of 1.5;&#13;
and, (c) adequate returns on net revalued fixed assets (10 percent) to attract equity financing. These&#13;
covenants will be reviewed frequently during the project implementation cycle to ensure that project&#13;
financial viability is maintained. Because of the divisible nature of the project, procurement will be&#13;
closely linked to financial returns. A major, mid-term project review will take place to assess the&#13;
costs and benefits to ensure the continued viability of the project. Semi-annual reviews will be&#13;
undertaken to ensure that key indicators are being maintained such as, price levels, equipment costs,&#13;
installation costs, energy savings and overall network investment costs.&#13;
10.   Institutional reform is considered to be a cornerstone of the expected success of the project.&#13;
The formation of independent joint stock companies has been a condition of inclusion under the&#13;
project. The benefits associated with corporatization/privatization are largely a function of the&#13;
attitudes and focus of the management and employees of the GDC. The employees have become&#13;
shareholders in a joint stock company whose benefits are directly tied to the financial success of the&#13;
GDC. There is considerable evidence that attention to profitability has already been established. The&#13;
GDC has been careful with the size of the project, having reduced the size of the loan to make sure&#13;
that only its priority needs are addressed.&#13;
11.    During project implementation, institutional reform will be reinforced through&#13;
twinning/training relationships. Volgograd Gorgas would be linked to a foreign GDC who would&#13;
provide training in key areas like: (a) technical aspects such as cathodic protection, metering and&#13;
SCADA systems; (b) financial and accounting practices based on GAAP standards; (c) management&#13;
information systems; (d) marketing; and, (e) human resource development. Shareholders and the&#13;
Board of Directors are expected to take an increasingly active role in the functioning of the company.&#13;
This is expected to be further reinforced when the Government further divests of its shares. This&#13;
process would be dealt with under a study in which the Government would seek assistance from&#13;
consultants on divestiture of its remaining shares.&#13;
12.    A component of the bid evaluation process is expected to include an assessment of the&#13;
financial viability of each project component given the bid prices. Should the lowest evaluated&#13;
technically responsive bid be much higher than the estimated cost, a review of the procurement&#13;
process would take place to identify problems. If problems warrant it, they could be dealt with&#13;
through retendering. If the cost of equipment would, through some unforeseen problem, jeopardize&#13;
the project or the owner's financial viability, the component would be dropped from the project.&#13;
Analysis&#13;
13.    Each component of the project's financial costs and benefits were assigned a probability&#13;
distribution based on the uncertainties for costs and quantities of capital expenditures for each year of&#13;
implementation. For ease of representation, each expenditure was assigned a triangular distribution,&#13;
representing most likely, minimum and most likely. The stochastic nature of the process was&#13;
simulated using a conunercially available risk analysis program. The simulation made use of Latin&#13;
2   Unlike power generation and similar projects whose benefits are contingent upon completing all of the&#13;
proposed investments, this project can achieve benefits with only part of the project implemented. For example,&#13;
installing half of the meters will result in half the benefits, cathodic protection on half the pipe network will&#13;
achieve half of the life extension benefits, etc.&#13;

Results&#13;
14.   The two different subcomponents of the gas distribution component - metering and asset life&#13;
extension - were analyzed separately. The Base Case on Asset Life Extension (cathodic protection,&#13;
SCADA and pipe replacement) resulted in an expected FIRR of 23.7 percent. This is less than that&#13;
indicated by the deterministic evaluation of the FIRR because the probability distribution of the&#13;
benefits are negatively skewed. The analysis was rerun, assuming that, as a result of pro-active&#13;
support of Russian manufacturers by the GDCs, Russian manufacturers would compete for the supply&#13;
contracts (Scenario 1). This was modelled by increasing the probability of a low priced bid. As a&#13;
result of attracting interest of Russian manufacturers, the expected FIRR increased to 25%. The&#13;
second scenario added the impact of modifying the bidding process if the bid prices were higher than&#13;
expected. This scenario (Scenario 2) assumed that if bid prices were higher than an acceptable&#13;
margin, bidding documents would be revised and rebidding would take place. The results of this&#13;
action would increase the expected FIRR to 25.8%. Scenario 4 added the impact of increasing&#13;
project implementation efficiency. This is expected to take place as a result of the formation of joint&#13;
stock companies, combined with the comprehensive twinning/training. This resulted in further&#13;
increasing the expected FIRR to 26.5%. Figure 1 summarizes the results of the incremental impact&#13;
of these assumptions.&#13;

15.   A similar analysis was undertaken for the metering component. The Base Case on Metering&#13;
(commercial, private houses, industrial, apartment and meter test equipment) resulted in an expected&#13;
FIRR of 11.9 percent. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 (as outlined above) increased the expected FIRR to&#13;
12.3%, 13%, and 13.2%, respectively. A further analysis (Scenario 4) assessed the impact of&#13;
improving the metering cost recovery through the proposed meter rental charges. This increased the&#13;
expected FIRR to 15.6%. These Scenarios are summarized in Figure 2.&#13;

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    This Annex details the assumptions and findings of the analysis of the financial performance of&#13;
Volgograd Gorgas, incorporating the financial commitments associated with the project, and summarizes&#13;
the findings with regard to the project's financial viability in terms of the cash flow and debt servicing&#13;
capabilities of the borrower, and of the projected ability to comply with financial covenants.&#13;
A.    Cash Flow and Self-financing Analysis&#13;
2.    A review was carried out to examine the ability of Volgograd Gorgas to finance the local share&#13;
of the project costs and also to adequately meet reasonable debt service and return-on-asset requirements&#13;
over the project life. Cash-flow projections were developed based on current and projected sales, sales&#13;
margins, and operating costs, and incorporating the cash flows associated with financing the projects and&#13;
meeting debt service requirements.&#13;
3.    Base financial figures were obtained for 1992 and 1993. Projections of revenues were based on&#13;
forecasts of sales volumes and retail prices. Operating costs were projected based on wholesale prices&#13;
associated with the retail price forecasts, and on inflationary adjustments to 1993 cost levels. VAT has&#13;
been excluded from both the purchase and selling prices of gas, since it is essentially a pass-through item&#13;
from the perspective of the utilities. Balance sheet accounts were generally adjusted with inflation,&#13;
through links to sales and expenditure projections (for example, inventories, accounts payable and cash-in-&#13;
bank were linked to operating costs, accounts receivable were linked to projected sales).&#13;
4.    Income statements have been prepared based on a GAAP style accrual basis. This could overstate&#13;
the corporate income tax liability, particularly during the first one to two years while the accruals&#13;
problem is being resolved. Over the longer term, however, the accrual basis is likely to conform to&#13;
actual statements as utilities follow the general move to accrual-style accounting.&#13;
5.    The key assumptions in the cash-flow analysis are summarized on Page 2. Page 3 provides&#13;
highlights of the findings. Pro forma income statements, balance sheets and source and application of&#13;
funds statements are included on Pages 4 through 6.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Gas Distribution Rehabilitation and
            Energy Efficiency Project will increase the efficiency of
            energy use in Russia, will improve the efficiency and safety
            of gas distribution, and will support policy reforms in the
            gas subsector. The project is expected to have both direct
            impact in the targeted cities and indirect impact elsewhere
            in Russia through the demonstration of technological and
            managerial principles. The project consists of three
            components: (a) gas distribution network improvements; (b)
            energy efficiency investments; and (c) technical assistance.
            The gas distribution network investments largely focus on
            metering, cathodic protection, and pipe replacement. Energy
            efficiency investment will focus on replacement of outdated
            and inefficient equipment. Technical assistance is designed
            both will support project implementation and to advance the
            government's reform program. An initial program aimed
            at greenhouse gas reduction, and financed under the Global
            Environment Facility, is also linked to the project.
