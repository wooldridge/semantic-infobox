                             in 2013/14. The past year has seen a rapid accumulation of arrears, sub-par&#13;
                             performance in domestic revenue collection, cuts in public spending on priority&#13;
                             sectors and local governments, and governance concerns that have delayed external&#13;
                             aid disbursements and forced the Government to borrow significant amounts on&#13;
                             the domestic market.&#13;
&#13;
                        Â&#132;Â&#132;   Prospects remain positive for Tanzaniaâ&#128;&#153;s macroeconomic performance, as long the&#13;
                             Government remains committed to fiscal prudence. The Government also needs&#13;
                             to be more vigilant in collecting domestic revenue (especially VAT) and to pay the&#13;
                             accumulated arrears with pension funds and contractors.&#13;
&#13;
                        Â&#132;Â&#132;   Tanzania could achieve an accelerated rate of equitable economic growth through&#13;
                             the efficient and fair development of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s comparative advantages. Such&#13;
                             comparative advantages include its tourism. While this sector already provides&#13;
                             significant benefits, it could be leveraged to create an even greater number of direct&#13;
                             and indirect jobs for Tanzanians.&#13;

             The views of the managers of the top 100 mid-sized companies in Tanzania have been&#13;
             collected every six months since April 2013. This data is collected by KPMG through&#13;
             electronic questionnaires and responses are anonymous. As of December 2014, only&#13;
             one third of managers forecast a better year for the economy in 2015 than in 2014&#13;
             against 56 percent in May 2014.  The same concerns emerged for their own businesses&#13;
             since only 37 percent expect an improved performance in the next 12 months. These&#13;

             Tanzanian economy.&#13;

                         Â&#132;Â&#132;   In 2012, at a global level, tourism provided employment for more than 260 million&#13;
                              individuals, equivalent to about 8.7 percent of the overall number of jobs (direct and&#13;
                              indirect) worldwide, or one in every 11 jobs;&#13;
                         Â&#132;Â&#132;   With regard to the supply chain in tourism, one job in the core tourism industry&#13;
                              indirectly generates 1.5 additional jobs in the related economy;&#13;
                         Â&#132;Â&#132;   Women represent the majority of the workforce in many countries;&#13;
                         Â&#132;Â&#132;   Youth employment is significant in the sector. Half of the tourism workforce is&#13;
                              under 25 years old.&#13;

                      Part II: Leveraging tourism for even&#13;
                      greater benefits&#13;
&#13;
                           Â&#132;Â&#132;   Tourism is a booming sector in Tanzania, with the country attracting more than&#13;
                                one million international visitors in 2013; bringing in more than US$ 1.5 billion in&#13;
                                foreign currency to one of the poorest economies in the world; and employing&#13;
                                approximately half a million people.&#13;
&#13;
                           Â&#132;Â&#132;   However, gains from the industry could benefit an even greater number of&#13;
                                Tanzanians. At present, the benefits derived from the industry are not optimal due&#13;
                                to the following reasons: (i) foreign visitors come to Tanzania through pre-arranged&#13;
                                packages booked abroad; (ii) over 90 percent of tourism activities are concentrated&#13;
                                in two geographical areas; (iii) the sector has become less labor intensive over&#13;
                                time; (iv) there are weak linkages with local communities and businesses; andÂ&#132;&#13;
                                (v) inefficient tax systems with complex and non-transparent mechanisms prevent&#13;
                                the optimal redistribution of rents from tourism.&#13;
&#13;
                           Â&#132;Â&#132;   Attracting more tourists and enabling geographical diversification in the south of&#13;
                                the country are two legitimate objectives. But this will require heavy investments&#13;
                                in infrastructure, reforms in the business environment, and smart management&#13;
                                of emerging trade-offs. These trade - offs include the competitive use of public&#13;
                                resources (water, land) and natural assets, as well as balancing pressures on local&#13;
                                communities and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
                           Â&#132;Â&#132;   The equitable development of the tourism sector can be accelerated in three ways:&#13;
                                (i) diversification, not only by location, but also by the type of tourism that the&#13;
                                country wants to promote (ii) intensification of linkages in existing locations; and&#13;
                                (iii) good governance.  &#13;

discussed for more than a decade. The              currently underdeveloped regions of the            sustainable.&#13;

Katavi and Kitulo? The second explanation,         of approaches, including the diversification&#13;
linked to the first, is that hospitality           and    protection    of   tourism     products;&#13;
infrastructure is also underdeveloped,             sustainable       integration    of    tourism&#13;

is that tourism attractions in the south are&#13;
perhaps not unique or developed enough             The development of the full tourism value&#13;

                         challenges in the development of its resort due to guests being forced to travel a 50km&#13;
                         stretch of a cliff-side road which was very unsafe and uncomfortable during the rainy&#13;
                         season.  However, with the establishment of a PPP with local government agencies and&#13;
                         the neighboring community, the road was paved. This resulted in dramatically decreased&#13;
                         travel time for resort guests, while at the same time opening up the area for more&#13;
                         tourism activities and enhancing the quality of life of members of local communities.&#13;

 Gambia offers professional courses in all sectors of the tourism industry, with special&#13;
 emphasis on travel agencies, accommodation, tour operations, tour guiding, group&#13;
 operations, event management, and general tourism business management. Close links&#13;
 with the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and South Nottingham College in&#13;
 the United Kingdom have resulted in course improvements and visiting lecturers. The&#13;
 Institute is also supported by the Center for Responsible Tourism in the United Kingdom&#13;
 which enables it to promote the teaching of responsible tourism as a core activity. The&#13;
 Institute also hosts professional and college groups from developed countries who study&#13;
 issues related to pro-poor and responsible tourism, using the Gambia as a case study.&#13;

              Peruâ&#128;&#153;s hotel scheme: The Peru Orient Express Hotels chain has corporate social&#13;
              responsibility programs that reach out to local communities to establish supplier&#13;
              relationships. The chain has considered and implemented the programs that involve&#13;
              linkages with community initiatives from a number of sectors, including dance and&#13;
              folklore groups, and producers of lamb, potatoes and trout. While not all these initiatives&#13;
              were successful, successful linkages were established with fishing communities for the&#13;
              contractual supply of freshly farmed trout to the hotel. As a result, farmers increased&#13;
              their output, as the hotel provides a ready market for the trout.&#13;

              Nepalâ&#128;&#153;s community-run initiative: The â&#128;&#152;Explore Villageâ&#128;&#153; non-profit organization is&#13;
              a private citizen-funded organization that offers tourism services such as homestay&#13;
              programs and hiking, cultural, festival and pilgrimage tours in several villages.&#13;
              Approximately 25 percent of the revenues accrued from these programs go towards&#13;
              improving literacy among women, improving educational services, and providing&#13;
              support for agricultural and health services, while the rest support service provision&#13;

              the Namibian government and NGOs. Community business ventures between private&#13;
              tour operators and the local community work by subleasing community-reserved land&#13;
              to private tourism investors in return for direct payment to local community institutions.&#13;
              With incentives for communities to conserve biodiversity, the program has led to an&#13;
              increase in local incomes and to the conservation of wildlife. There are currently 79&#13;
              registered conservancies in Namibia, with these currently occupying approximately 20&#13;

                           Box 8: Excessive upfront payments kill business&#13;
&#13;
 To register as a tour operator in Tanzania, an investor must make upfront payments of&#13;
 up to US$ 5,000 for the tourism license (TALA) and own a minimum of five vehicles.   &#13;
 In comparison, the equivalent license fee in Kenya costs only USUS$ 200, with a&#13;
 requirement that the operator own only a single vehicle. With such high entry barriers,&#13;
 it is no surprise there are about 60 percent more registered tour operators in Kenya than&#13;
 in Tanzania.27&#13;

            Tanzania economic update : the elephant in
            the room - unlocking the potential of the tourism industry
            for Tanzanians
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The focus of this economic update is the
            tourism sector, which is clearly central to Tanzania&#146;s drive
            toward economic emergence. Riding on the country&#146;s bountiful
            natural assets, tourism is a fast growing sector that is not
            only providing jobs but is also bringing in much-needed
            foreign currency. This sector already benefits from
            substantial attention from the country&#146;s leadership, notably
            in the context of the national business council that
            recently prioritized tourism as a high growth industry and a
            major source of job creation. Nevertheless, more can be done
            to increase benefits so they can be felt more broadly across
            society. This update proposes three strategic directions
            towards achieving this goal: (i) the diversification of
            tourism activities, in multiple dimensions; (ii) further
            integration in to the sector of stakeholders such as local
            communities and small operators; and (iii) good governance
            in the management of fiscal revenues as well as in the use
            of natural assets. This update also assesses the current
            state of the Tanzanian economy. While recent developments
            remain globally positive with high and stable GDP growth and
            with the inflation rate currently in check, fiscal risks for
            Tanzania have been growing. During the last fiscal year, the
            Government missed its revenue targets and was forced to cut
            priority expenditures and accumulate arrears with
            contractors and pension funds.
