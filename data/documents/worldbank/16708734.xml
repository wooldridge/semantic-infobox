The information contained in this update is a compilation of activities in which WSP engaged during the&#13;
2008 International Year of Sanitation. Many of these efforts would not have been possible without the&#13;
close collaboration of sector partners from around the world, including academia, civil society and&#13;
international development organizations, the private sector, and State Governments. We also wish to&#13;
acknowledge the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), which led&#13;
coordination efforts for IYS working with the UN-Water Task Force on Sanitation.&#13;

&amp;#12;Background:&#13;
&#13;
The United Nations General Assembly designated 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation (IYS). WSP&#13;
prepared an action plan that built on WSPâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation strategy, a core pillar of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s FY2009-2018&#13;
Global Strategy. The action plan comprised the following components:&#13;
&#13;
1.       Partnering to implement the UN International Year of Sanitation;&#13;
2.       Advocating for reform of sanitation policies and increases in sanitation&#13;
         investments;&#13;
3.       Technical assistance to governments to develop sanitation policies and strategies;&#13;
4.       Capacity building to design and implement large scale sanitation programs;&#13;
5.       Supporting government efforts to develop and implement Sanitation Roadmaps;&#13;
6.       Supporting governments to scale up handwashing with soap behavior change; and&#13;
7.       Learning, capturing, and sharing knowledge on sanitation and hygiene best&#13;
         practices.&#13;
&#13;
Results during IYS:&#13;
&#13;
1.       Partnering to implement the UN International Year of Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
           Regional sanitation conferences created high level political action and commitment&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;The Philippine participation in EASAN would lead to improvement of sanitation projects in the&#13;
Philippines. I will encourage my colleagues in Congress to give this top priority.â&#128;?-Atty. Belma A.&#13;
Cabilao, Congresswoman, Philippines&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;EASAN provides â&#128;¦ a necessary platform to make progress on sanitation as a common good for&#13;
everybody.â&#128;? -Lu Lay Sreng, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Rural Development, Cambodia&#13;
&#13;
In partnership with governments and other international organizations, WSP supported efforts to design,&#13;
raise funds for, organize, and implement four regional Ministerial-level conferences that proved to be key&#13;
IYS flagship events:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Africa (AFRICASAN V - February 2008, in Durban, South Africa)&#13;
     ï&#130;·   East Asia (EASAN - November 2007, in Beppu, Japan)&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Latin America (LATINOSAN - November 2007, in Cali, Colombia)&#13;
     ï&#130;·   South Asia (SACOSAN III - November 2008, in New Delhi, India).&#13;
&#13;
Prior to the conferences, WSP supported efforts within the participating countries at both national and sub-&#13;
national levels to carry out a series of workshops to build interest in, and prepare for the conferences&#13;
through the preparation of country-level papers and in some cases sanitation MDG roadmaps. This was&#13;
done while simultaneously working with the news media to create widespread public awareness of&#13;
sanitation challenges and opportunities. These conferences were highly successful at supporting high level&#13;
political commitment from each country to design and implement follow up action plans to reach the&#13;
sanitation MDGs. These events laid the groundwork for subsequent national policy reforms and sanitation&#13;
scale-up programs in these regions, which WSP also supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     4&#13;
&amp;#12;     The AFRICASAN V conference produced the eThekwini ministerial political declaration, which notably&#13;
     included a pledge to â&#128;&#156;establish specific public sector budget allocations for sanitation and hygiene&#13;
     programs. Our aspiration is that these allocations should be a minimum of 0.5% of GDP for sanitation&#13;
     and hygiene.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
     During 2008, countries began to implement this pledge. Examples include:&#13;
&#13;
         ï&#130;·    In Burkina Faso, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Fishery Resources announced&#13;
              significant allocations for sanitation and hygiene, particularly in rural areas that previously&#13;
              received no specific allocations from the State budget.&#13;
         ï&#130;·    In Ethiopia, the Ministry of Health has adopted promotion of sanitation and hygiene in its core&#13;
              plan for the current fiscal year, requiring every District to develop their own action plans. To&#13;
              add political impetus from the highest level, a national workshop, EthioSan 2008, is planned for&#13;
              later in the year.&#13;
         ï&#130;·    In Kenya, the Government has set up a separate ministry for Public Health and Sanitation,&#13;
              previously under the Health ministry. The combined allocation for health â&#128;&#148; including the&#13;
              ministries of Medical Services, and Public Health and Sanitation â&#128;&#148; was increased from US$514&#13;
              million to US$537 million for the current fiscal year.&#13;
         ï&#130;·    In Tanzania, the Government has increased annual funding to the sanitation and hygiene sector&#13;
              from approximately US$1 million to almost US$10 million and funds are being dedicated for&#13;
              sanitation and hygiene to local governments under the SWAP approach.&#13;
&#13;
2.           Advocating for reform of sanitation policies and increases in sanitation investments&#13;
&#13;
The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) provided economic research as evidence to raise awareness&#13;
                                    and empower decision-makers&#13;
&#13;
Globally, the evidence documented in the ESI report has contributed to the sanitation sector thinking and&#13;
dialogue as evidenced by the multiple and ongoing references to this WSP study throughout the IYS&#13;
through high-level podium presentations worldwide. The ESI has also contributed to action on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
The Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI) was a response to major gaps in evidence among Southeast&#13;
Asian countries on the economic aspects of sanitation. The phase 1 study found that the economic costs of&#13;
poor sanitation and hygiene amount to over US$9 billion a year in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the&#13;
Philippines, and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
The report provided the evidence that Ministry level- and other decision-makers needed to make the case&#13;
for increased national budget allocations for water and sanitation sector solutions. The evidence also&#13;
supports sanitation advocacy efforts and helps in selecting among alternative sanitation program&#13;
approaches and technical options.&#13;

&#13;
During the IYS, WSP carried out advocacy work using the results of the ESI report, which resonated in the&#13;
countries for which detailed results were available as of the second quarter of 20081. WSP developed a&#13;
publication and dissemination plan and tailored the materials towards various audiences in order to convey&#13;
the message: â&#128;&#156;Doing nothing has a cost.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
       Results for Lao PDR were available in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;In Cambodia, where the ESI report found that economic losses due to lack of appropriate sanitation were at&#13;
about 7 percent of GDP, and where sanitation is off track according to JMP data, the Prime Minister&#13;
mobilized his government to action. Following the release of the ESI impact study results, the Government&#13;
of Cambodia established a Technical Working Group for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene,&#13;
tasked with overseeing the design (and subsequent official adoption) of a rural water supply and sanitation&#13;
strategy. ESI data is being used as the basis for the RWSS strategy as well as the Sector Financing Strategy&#13;
(both under development). In addition, for the first time since transitioning back to democracy in 1993,&#13;
Cambodia is implementing a US$14 million RWSS project with its own resources.&#13;
&#13;
To support the Government of Cambodia taking these initial, significant steps on sanitation, WSP&#13;
published the Cambodia ESI results in two print versions (a detailed version explaining the methodology&#13;
and a shorter, executive version, also in Khmer), and prepared a video documentary Together we can do it:&#13;
A toilet for everyone (launched in November, 2008). An increased focus on sanitation was evident across&#13;
the Government: inserts for Health Messenger, a magazine for health staff and health centers, clinics, and&#13;
hospitals in Cambodia, and a cartoon series based on the impact of the ESI study, were also developed by&#13;
WSP to support the Department of Health. These additional products were also disseminated, among other&#13;
channels, in the World Bank Newsletter to commune councils in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Journalists in other East Asian countries frequently quoted the main ESI study results, prepared by WSP as&#13;
two-page summaries in English and national languages (for Vietnam and Indonesia, and in English only for&#13;
the Philippines). The results, which indicated that the costs of inaction affected the entire spectrum of&#13;
society in terms of health, tourism, industry, and the environment, were shared with a multi-stakeholder&#13;
audience of donors, government representatives, news media, and NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesian government has adopted the ESI results as a basis for their media interventions. Moreover,&#13;
there has been great interest at the local government level to understand and increase awareness of the ESI&#13;
results, in some cases having asked WSP to share preliminary ESI Phase II results at a sanitation summit to&#13;
underscore, and be involved in ongoing results.&#13;
&#13;
In the Philippines, ESI methodology and results were used in workshops with city mayors to foster&#13;
consideration of economic and social impacts of poor sanitation in their jurisdictions.&#13;
&#13;
3.        Technical assistance to governments to develop sanitation policies and strategies&#13;
&#13;
     A.   Developing city-wide urban sanitation strategies in Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesia Sanitation Sector Development Program (ISSDP) is implemented by the Government of&#13;
Indonesia with technical support and capacity building from WSP. The program has been fostering an&#13;
enabling environment for urban sanitation services development. The program pays special attention to&#13;
planning, capacity building, and institutional arrangements at the city and provincial level, policy and&#13;
strategy at the national level, and advocacy and awareness-raising at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
After three years, Government ownership of the program is strong and a distinct shift is evidenced by&#13;
recent national policy and strategy announcements about improving urban sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Each of the six municipalities involved in Phase 1 of ISSDP has set up a sanitation working group (Pokja)&#13;
across ministerial boundaries and has produced its own City-wide Sanitation Strategy (CSS). Eight more&#13;
cities and three provinces are currently following the model developed in Phase 2. Quality of the CSS&#13;
varies from city to city, but in every case the Pokja is promoting the CSS to both the political leadership&#13;
and operational departments as a key reference point for city planning and budgeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         The cities now have a framework for action and resource&#13;
                                         deployment, a better understanding of current sanitation problems,&#13;
                                         and are better placed to deal with them. City-based agencies&#13;
                                         concerned with sanitation are now working together more&#13;
                                         effectively, their work is more integrated and the level of&#13;
                                         motivation within the Pokjas is impressive, despite time&#13;
                                         constraints.&#13;
&#13;
                                         It has become clear to both local and national managers that the&#13;
                                         problem in urban sanitation is not only a lack of investment; it is&#13;
                                         also the lack of a doable, implementable incremental plan.&#13;
&#13;
                                       City-wide sanitation strategies are important as they prioritize&#13;
                                       investment needs, enabling municipalities to direct incoming&#13;
                                       funds (whether from the center, province, or donors) to where&#13;
                                       they are most needed. After initial skepticism at the national level,&#13;
the Government now assigns significant value to the city sanitation strategies. The Minister of Public&#13;
Works has announced the Ministryâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to supporting a decentralized approach to sanitation&#13;
development and the intention to extend the CSS process to all 226 cities by 2014. In collaboration with&#13;
other Ministries, departments, and stakeholders, the Ministry of Works is now developing technical&#13;
assistance and support plans.&#13;
&#13;
The profile of sanitation in municipal plans in the six cities has increased substantially since 2006, and the&#13;
CSS process allows increased participation by poor communities and women than before. One City&#13;
Facilitator described ISSDP as a wake-up call for municipalities, and this is confirmed by the steadily&#13;
increasing commitment to action.&#13;
&#13;
    B.   â&#128;&#156;Ignitingâ&#128;? Amhara (Ethiopia) to Scale Up Hygiene and Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
Building on previous efforts to support the development of sanitation and hygiene policies and strategies at&#13;
the national and regional level, WSP collaborated with the Amhara Regional Health Bureau during 2008 to&#13;
start at scale implementation of the National Hygiene and Sanitation Strategy. Amhara is a populous&#13;
region in Ethiopia with roughly 20 million inhabitants, representing 25 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s population.&#13;
&#13;
The Bureau adopted a community-led total behavior change program on hygiene and sanitation dubbed&#13;
Learning by Doing At Scale Hygiene and Sanitation. In the program, local leaders and health extension&#13;
workers catalyze sanitation and hygiene behavior change by employing the use of dignity, norms, local&#13;
resources, and incentives for collective achievement. These are integrated into actions at multiple levels&#13;
(regional, zonal, woreda, kebele, community), across multiple sectors (health, education, water, youth,&#13;
women, private commercial), and using multiple communication channels (advocacy, community events,&#13;
face-to-face, mass media, religious institutions, school curriculum).&#13;
&#13;
At the local level, the behavior change strategy places health extension workers at the center of district and&#13;
local-level hygiene and sanitation promotion activities, increasing their capacity to mobilize communities,&#13;
negotiating individually with households the best sanitary options for them.&#13;
&#13;
Key elements include effective implementation of partnerships between development partners, government,&#13;
NGOs, and private sector; and strengthening the regional and district (Woreda) capacities for hygiene&#13;
improvement. In 2008, four Woredas served as regional â&#128;&#156;hands on learning laboratoriesâ&#128;? and have&#13;
therefore been targeted for total behavior change in hygiene and sanitation with the related results indicated&#13;
in the figure below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      8&#13;
&amp;#12;The community led total behavior change program was launched in an additional six Woredas, with&#13;
estimates of some 600,000 people having been reached by the program in 2008. The overall goal is to reach&#13;
the entire regional population and achieve total behavior change on hygiene and sanitation for the&#13;
20 million people living in Amhara by 2012. The At Scale initiative is documented in a Woreda Resource&#13;
Book for Community-Led Total Behavior Change in Hygiene and Sanitation, and practical training manuals&#13;
have been developed for use in Amhara and for adoption and replication in other regions of the country.&#13;

&#13;
    C. Assisting Governments in development of policies, strategies, and approaches for urban and rural&#13;
       sanitation&#13;
&#13;
During 2008, WSP worked with national and local governments in focus countries to review, develop, and&#13;
implement effective policies, strategies, and sector reform measures to create enabling environments for&#13;
large scale sustainable sanitation programs. Examples include:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Assisting the Government of the Philippines to develop national strategies through the Sustainable&#13;
        Sanitation in East Asia program and in Vietnam through the Unified Sanitation Strategy and&#13;
        Action Plan&#13;
    ï&#130;·   In Indonesia, WSP assisted the Ministry of Health in drafting its community-based sanitation&#13;
        strategy, which was signed by the Minister in August, 2008. The progressive strategy combines&#13;
        community-led total sanitation â&#128;&#147; including the abolition of subsidies for household sanitation, a&#13;
        national handwashing with soap campaign, household water treatment technologies, and solid and&#13;
        liquid waste management efforts to address rural sanitation at scale.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   In Central America with support from WSP and UNICEF, the regional political body FOCARD-&#13;
        APS designed a regional sanitation strategy that has now been endorsed by the Ministries of&#13;
        Health of all of the Central American countries.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   In India, the National Urban Sanitation Policy, which lays out a vision for total sanitation for&#13;
        cities, was approved in November 2008 after extensive consultation facilitated by WSP. This&#13;
        policy includes a Nirmal Shahar Puraskar (Clean Cities Award) that honors cities that achieve&#13;
        total sanitation (i.e. open defecation-free plus 100 percent safe waste disposal). In 2008, the&#13;
        Nirmal Gram Puraskar (Clean Village Award) honored over 10,000 rural local governments that&#13;
        successfully achieved total sanitation status (i.e. open defecation free plus 100 percent toilet&#13;
        coverage).&#13;
    ï&#130;·   In Pakistan, the National Sanitation Policy targets an open defecation-free environment and the&#13;
        use of rewards for sanitary outcomes. In 2008, all four provinces drafted policies and strategies&#13;
        that include reward plans for local governments that deliver improved outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     9&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;·    WSP is also supporting government efforts to develop national rural and urban sanitation policies&#13;
         in Bolivia, Peru, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Cambodia, and Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
    D. The Global Scaling Up Sanitation Program&#13;
&#13;
A key element of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Global Strategy is to collaborate with, and support partners to carry out large scale&#13;
programs that increase access to sanitation for the poor. The Global Scaling Up Sanitation project is a&#13;
WSP flagship effort to work with national and local governments to learn how to design and implement&#13;
large scale sanitation programs. The Global Scaling Up Sanitation project builds on the promising&#13;
approaches of Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) and Sanitation Marketing to generate sanitation&#13;
demand at scale and increase the supply of sanitation products and services.&#13;
&#13;
The global project also strengthens the political and institutional enabling environments at both the national&#13;
and local government levels to ensure programmatic sustainability of these large scale programs. During&#13;
2008, the global project resulted in increasing access to improved sanitation for over 1 million people in&#13;
India and Indonesia. In both countries, the enabling environment was strengthened at both national and&#13;
local levels, contributing to the increased likelihood that project gains will be sustained and replicated.&#13;
&#13;
National and local governments are contributing human and financial resources to scale up the CLTS and&#13;
Sanitation Marketing approaches. New knowledge products and tools have been developed to engage&#13;
partners and stakeholders in a dialogue about the results emerging from the project and to begin replicating&#13;
in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
                        Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project Outcomes during 2008&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    More than 1 million people have gained access to improved sanitation facilities (26 percent of end&#13;
         of project target).&#13;
    ï&#130;·    854 communities/local governments achieved open-defecation-free (ODF) status.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Increased government commitment to CLTS approach and sanitation and hygiene at national and&#13;
         local levels.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Strengthened strategic framework for sanitation and hygiene with the launching of national&#13;
         strategies for hygiene and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    E.   Capacity building&#13;
&#13;
A core mandate for WSP is to help strengthen the capacity of our national and local government partners to&#13;
effectively provide improved sanitation services to the poor. This was a major area of work for WSP&#13;
during IYS. Below are some examples.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    In India, 720 participants from seven states â&#128;&#148; Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra&#13;
         Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, Sikkim, and Meghalaya â&#128;&#148; were trained in CLTS approaches for district&#13;
         and state officials and implementing agencies in South Asia and Southeast Asia.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Training was developed for master trainers for social mobilization at the provincial level and for&#13;
         arranging conclaves of village activists for triggering ODF villages in Pakistan.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    WSP supported the establishment of Centers of Excellence for sustainable sanitation to strengthen&#13;
         and develop the capacity of workers and professionals on sanitation in India and the Philippines.&#13;
         In India, two major national workshops involving 10 states were held on urban sanitation, and one&#13;
         regional consultation was held in Tamil Nadu involving five states.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    WSP participates in a capacity-building working group with the Government of Peru, helping to&#13;
         assess training capacity that exists in the country and to identify appropriate demand responses.&#13;
         The group also develops specific training curricula with local universities on water and sanitation&#13;
         services in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;4.       Supporting government efforts to develop and implement Sanitation Roadmaps&#13;
&#13;
                                      Country Sanitation Reviews (CSRs)&#13;
&#13;
In preparation for the AfricaSan +5 conference, the African Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW)&#13;
requested WSP and the African Development Bank to prepare a rapid 30-country sanitation review, called&#13;
Can Africa Afford to Miss the Sanitation MDG Target?&#13;
&#13;
The report concludes that few countries in Africa are expected to achieve the sanitation MDG targets unless&#13;
approaches to sanitation change. For Africa to meet the target, the number of persons served must more&#13;
than double from 350 million in 2006 to 760 million by 2015, still leaving almost 400 million un-served.&#13;
The report concluded that the region requires a major effort from all stakeholders to achieve the MDG on&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
The CSRs are a baseline to track progress against sanitation MDG targets â&#128;&#147; not only in terms of tracking&#13;
coverage but also in terms of tracking the improvement and strengthening of the political and institutional&#13;
environment that will enable the sanitation programs to scale up and become sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
Progress in Africa, against this baseline and the eThekwini declaration, will be assessed in a second round&#13;
of Country Status Overviews to be published in the coming year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.       Supporting governments to scale up handwashing with soap behavior change&#13;
&#13;
      The Global Scaling-up Handwashing with Soap project in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam&#13;
&#13;
The Scaling Up Handwashing with Soap Project is a global project that launched interventions during 2008&#13;
in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The project focuses on a strong enabling environment to support&#13;
the long-term sustainability and national scale following the end of the project. The project is working with&#13;
the private sector and national and local governments to improve the handwashing behaviors of over&#13;
5 million mothers, care-givers, and school children through an innovative behavior-change approach based&#13;
on social marketing principles. During 2008 over 1 million of the target population was exposed to&#13;
strategically targeted messages to promote changes in handwashing behavior using mass media, community&#13;
events, household visits, and various print materials.&#13;
&#13;
Equally important is gathering rigorous, evidence-based learning of the health and poverty impacts&#13;
resulting from the work to share with other professionals interested in replicating improved handwashing&#13;
programs in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.       Learning, capturing, and sharing knowledge on sanitation and hygiene best practices.&#13;
&#13;
     A. Working with the domestic private sector to improve sanitation products and services for the poor&#13;
        in Peru&#13;
&#13;
The Creating Sanitation Markets (APSS) initiative is a market approach to improving sanitation based on&#13;
the following:&#13;
     ï&#130;· integration of consumer demand&#13;
     ï&#130;· a competent, articulated, and profitable local-national private sector able to provide an integrated&#13;
          sanitation package (sanitation options, installation and maintenance services, financial facilities,&#13;
          and post-purchasing advice and support)&#13;
     ï&#130;· a micro-credit system, which includes financial products for sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   key local partners committed to sustainable sanitation management, and to the promotion and&#13;
         regulation of the sanitation market.&#13;
&#13;
The APSS initiative pays special attention to the active involvement of the private sector in sanitation&#13;
supply, promoting it as a business opportunity to benefit local development. It is a strong, market-driven&#13;
approach that implies moving from the vision of the poor as â&#128;&#156;beneficiariesâ&#128;? to â&#128;&#156;customers.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
The implications of this shift are crucial: while beneficiaries have necessities to be fulfilled by either the&#13;
state or the municipality with little concern about their visions and preferences, customers have the â&#128;&#156;right to&#13;
chooseâ&#128;? among different alternatives. They are responsible for good decision-making and have the power&#13;
to shape supply.&#13;
&#13;
During 2008, modest but promising results after a six month effort include:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    construction commencement of sanitation facilities&#13;
    ï&#130;·    expansion of local private sector range of sanitation products and services&#13;
    ï&#130;·    involvement of local private sector in promotional efforts to create demand&#13;
    ï&#130;·    creation and offering by banking sector of targeted sanitation micro-credit to families and local&#13;
         businesses.&#13;
&#13;
    B.   Six country study on sanitation finance policies and programmatic practices&#13;
&#13;
WSP carried out a global study of financing policies and practices for reaching the poor with improved&#13;
sanitation and hygiene interventions at the household level. The overall objectives of the study were to:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    gain a more in-depth understanding of current hygiene and sanitation financing practices and&#13;
         policies and their effectiveness in reaching the poor&#13;
    ï&#130;·    provide guidance to development partners for the development of sanitation-related financing&#13;
         policies and practices.&#13;
&#13;
The study focused on how increased access to improved household sanitation facilities for poor urban and&#13;
rural families can be financed, with a blend of household finance and public subsidies. Six cases were&#13;
studied in Ecuador, Vietnam, Senegal, India, Bangladesh, and Mozambique to illustrate a range of&#13;
financing approaches to rural and urban household on-site sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Key findings from the study included the following:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    The software component was a necessary financial input to create demand and represented a&#13;
         highly variable portion of the costs of each facility, ranging from 28 percent in Bangladesh to&#13;
         seven percent in Maharashtra.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Targeted and well managed hardware subsidies have an important role to play in making improved&#13;
         and adequate sanitation accessible to the poor. Fixed amount subsidies rather than percentage-&#13;
         based subsidies were more effective at leveraging household investment while guaranteeing a&#13;
         minimum service level, but they need to be managed actively to keep up with inflation and other&#13;
         cost factors.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    The provision of hardware subsidies on an output basis rather than an input basis is effective at&#13;
         stimulating demand and leveraging private investment.&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Providing access to finance (through micro-loans) can be a very effective way to promote&#13;
         household sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      12&#13;

    7.   Follow up action to be carried out during 2009&#13;
&#13;
Although the International Year of Sanitation has now past, sanitation and hygiene will continue to be an&#13;
important pillar of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Global Strategy. This is reflected in the most recent WSP Business Plan and&#13;
related budget, where over 50 percent of the global budget and programs are addressing sanitation and&#13;
hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
In East Asia, WSP will continue to focus on increasing awareness and influencing sanitation policy and&#13;
investment through evidence to ensure that not only policy-makers allocate more money to the sector, but&#13;
also that budgets for sanitation are used in a way to effectively and efficiently reach the greatest number of&#13;
people. ESI Phase 2 is designed to provide rigorous cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of existing&#13;
sanitation programs â&#128;&#148; both government- and donor-financed â&#128;&#148; in the EAP countries (including Yunnan&#13;
province of China) to help governments identify the most promising programs to achieve the MDGs and to&#13;
help identify budgetary options.&#13;
&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s ESI initiative, which was pioneered in East Asia, will now research and analyze the costs of&#13;
inadequate sanitation in Africa and South Asia. It is expected that these studies will provide compelling&#13;
regional and country-specific data and evidence to inform senior decision makers and encourage needed&#13;
investment in sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
In Africa, WSP has been asked by AMCOW to coordinate the implementation of the AfricaSan eThekwini&#13;
declaration commitments. Following the first meeting of the AfricaSan International Taskforce on the&#13;
eThekwini Declaration on November 26, 2008, the AMCOW Executive Committee called on WSP and&#13;
partners to implement the following actions under the coordination of WSP:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    support systematic follow-up of country level implementation of the eThekwini Declaration&#13;
    ï&#130;·    assist countries to develop national AfricaSan action plans and conduct a simple peer review&#13;
         exercise to enhance cross learning and improve the sanitation profile&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     13&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;·   work with relevant initiatives on Monitoring and Evaluation, such as the JMP, Global Framework&#13;
        for Action, and GLAAS, and also work with countries to include sanitation and hygiene in all&#13;
        monitoring and evaluation activities and programs&#13;
    ï&#130;·   develop a work program, funding proposal, and staffing plan for implementing AfricaSan follow-&#13;
        up activities&#13;
    ï&#130;·   report to AMCOW every six months on the implementation of the eThekwini commitments using&#13;
        the proposed indicators and with the support of the AMCOW TAC members&#13;
    ï&#130;·   develop a concept note for the 3rd AfricaSan Conference to be held in Kenya in early 2011&#13;
    ï&#130;·   hold an AfricaSan Awards Ceremony in 2009&#13;
    ï&#130;·   hold a meeting of the AfricaSan International Task Force every quarter and a face-to-face meeting&#13;
        every six months&#13;
    ï&#130;·   open an AfricaSan window within the AMCOW web site&#13;
&#13;
In Latin America and the Caribbean, WSP will evaluate and learn from its Sanitation as a Business project&#13;
in Peru. WSP will also continue to support Peruâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to scale up handwashing with soap efforts and&#13;
expand these in Central America.&#13;
&#13;
In South Asia, WSP will continue to focus on scaling up rural sanitation through CLTS and sanitation&#13;
marketing in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. WSP will also begin to work on urban sanitation, including&#13;
the development of a city-wide sanitation planning tool and of urban sanitation policies.&#13;
&#13;
Globally, WSP will continue to work with national and local governments in India, Indonesia, Tanzania,&#13;
Vietnam, Senegal, Peru, and other countries to learn and share design and implementation methods of large&#13;
scale sanitation and hygiene projects. During 2009, WSP will complete baseline studies for the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
global impact evaluation, assessing the economic, health, and social impacts of large scale sanitation and&#13;
handwashing programs on the poor in the six countries. Meanwhile, a global study on the Political&#13;
Economy of Sanitation (with case studies in Brazil, Senegal, India, and Indonesia) seeks to better&#13;
understand vested interests that either constrain or promote appropriate investments in sanitation to reach&#13;
the rural and urban poor.&#13;

            Update on WSP activities to support
            International Year of Sanitation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The information contained in this update
            is a compilation of activities in which WSP engaged during
            the 2008 International Year of Sanitation (IYS), thus
            designated by the United Nations General Assembly. WSP
            prepared an action plan that built on WSP's sanitation
            strategy, a core pillar of WSP's FY2009-2018 Global
            Strategy. The action plan comprised the following
            components: 1. Partnering to implement the UN International
            Year of Sanitation; 2. Advocating for reform of sanitation
            policies and increases in sanitation investments; 3.
            Technical assistance to governments to develop sanitation
            policies and strategies; 4. Capacity building to design and
            implement large scale sanitation programs; 5. Supporting
            government efforts to develop and implement Sanitation
            Roadmaps; 6. Supporting governments to scale up handwashing
            with soap behavior change; and 7. Learning, capturing, and
            sharing knowledge on sanitation and hygiene best practices.
            For each of these components, a section of the report is
            devoted to describing how it was achieved.
