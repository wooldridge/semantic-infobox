Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to&#13;
time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its&#13;
framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of&#13;
Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;
relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under&#13;
the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;
activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;

Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;

Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis&#13;
up to a maximum of four point twenty-nine percent (4.29%) of the total Contributions under all&#13;
Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first&#13;
Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;
be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would&#13;
thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement&#13;
existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
