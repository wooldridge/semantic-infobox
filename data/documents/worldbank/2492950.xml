Assessment Objectives&#13;
The assessment was to:&#13;
e Determine the extent, to which projects and programs are based on principles of demand responsiveness, were&#13;
participatory, gender sensitive and had a poverty focus,&#13;
* Assess the extent to which participatory gender sensitive approaches had impact in sustainability&#13;
of projects,&#13;
* Determine the factors that facilitated and or limited the implementation of participatory gender sensitive&#13;
approaches in planning and execution of projects,&#13;
* Assess whether the projects and programs had different impacts on men and women, rich and poor considering the&#13;
benefits as well as the burdens of operating and maintaining the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services at the&#13;
household level, and&#13;
Use the findings of the assessments as inputs in the refinement of rural water supply intervention strategies.&#13;
PLA Assessment Methodology&#13;
The PLA initiative developed a participatory methodology appropriate for cross-checking information, now popularly&#13;
known as the Methodology for Participatory Assessments (MPA)'. The PLA assessment utilized the&#13;
following participatory tools: wealth ranking, community mapping, transect walk, pocket voting and scoring, history of;&#13;
participation, ladders I and 11 and policy and organizational analysis. Qualitative data was analyzed during the field study&#13;
while quantitative analysis using SPSS package was done after the study. In addition to the participatory tools, other&#13;
methods used included focus group discussions, interviews, direct observation and a number of research instruments.&#13;
Background&#13;
The Republic of Kenya lies on the eastern side of the African continent. The Indian Ocean and Somalia border it to&#13;
the east, Sudan and Ethiopia.to the North, Uganda to the west and Tanzania to the south. The country has an area of&#13;
582,000km and a coastline of 608kmz. Nairobi, the capital city, is an important international communication center.&#13;
Inter tropical convergence zones and altitude give rise to varied climatic regimes. Annual rainfall follows a wet and dry&#13;
cyclic pattern with an average of 631 mm  annually. This however, conceals the extreme contrasts from&#13;
tropical rainforest to desert areas.&#13;
There are about 42 different ethnic communities in Kenya. The 1999 population estimate stood at 30 million. Child&#13;
mortality has remained high at 8.3%. The Gross National Product is US$280 per capita that has been declining since&#13;
the 1980's. The estimated total water potential (from surface and groundwater) of 20,209 million cm3 far exceeds the&#13;
total annual demand of 2,500 million cm3. However, less than 50% of rural populations and 70% of urban residents&#13;
have access to safe water.&#13;
A met-guide detailing the MPA is now available for gender mainstreaming and monitoring&#13;

Kenya National Development Policy in Context&#13;
Since independence in 1963, the government has sought to address priority areas of need identified as: poverty,&#13;
illiteracy and diseases. The role played by water sector in economic growth was recognized in the 1970's and the&#13;
government ambitiously invested and took over several water supplies previously managed by local communities&#13;
or authorities and other public or private institutions. However, in 1986, due to dwindling resources (as a result&#13;
of economic slow down), the government started encouraging local authorities to take over the management of&#13;
water supplies. With increasing inefficiency and sustainability being elusive, the government undertook to address&#13;
these problems through Sessional Paper No. I of 1999 on National Policy on Water Resources Management and&#13;
Development. In this paper which focuses on poverty reduction, water is a main concern.&#13;
Kenya's Water Policy&#13;
The aim of the policy is to guide water sector activities to achieve sustainable development and management of&#13;
water resources.The policy provides a framework in which the desired target/goals are set; outlines necessary&#13;
measures to guide the entire range of actions to synchronise all water related activities and actors.The basic areas&#13;
addressed by the policy include water resource management, water supply and sewerage development, institutional&#13;
arrangements and financing for water sector.The ministry recognises the enormous task and concerted efforts in&#13;
the adequate provision of these services and has formed both the Urban and Rural Water and Sanitation working&#13;
groups, constituting various sector partners to deliberate and strategize on the delivery of services.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Currently, there are over 2000 water supplies in the country developed and managed by various actors including the&#13;
Government (Department of Water Development) which is the main player, communities, municipalities, private&#13;
individuals, institutions and other actors. However, most of the water sources and supplies have become unreliable over&#13;
time. Sewerage facilities are unevenly distributed in favor of urban areas where they are managed by municipalities and&#13;
councils. Pit latrines mainly serve the rural areas whose coverage is less than 40%.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
Project sustainability is the ability to sustain itself in  arrangements for replacement of facilities or major&#13;
terms of functioning physical infrastructure and the  repairs. This points to some unpreparedness.&#13;
proficiency  of users and  local management         Water committees are responsible for determining&#13;
committee to effectively maintain, manage and       user fees per 20 litre-jerrican services, setting up&#13;
finance the service. Sustainability is influenced by  meetings, organizing for repairs, records keeping,&#13;
consumer satisfaction, technical and managerial     water safety and cleanliness. Minor repairs do not  i&#13;
abilities, financial arrangements, legal or informal  exceed two days, and are undertaken by trained&#13;
ownership, access to tools and spare parts, technical  committee members but outside trained artisans&#13;
support and backstopping.                           are hired to undertake major repairs on voluntary&#13;
basis for a small token. However in every&#13;
All the four water supply systems visited during the  community, there are one or two highly trusted&#13;
assessment in 1999 were functioning and offered     members bestowed with most of the major&#13;
satisfactory adequate services of water supply     responsibilities of keeping the systems functioning.&#13;
throughout the year.  Effective financing of the&#13;
systems is expected through locally agreed payment  The water facilities are easily accessible to all&#13;
modalities. The user charges determined by the      potential users and are consistently used. Overall&#13;

maintenance costs thereby forcing members to        gender and socio-economic status, in all the water&#13;

In addition, the communities contributed by clearing the bush, drawing water for construction, and transporting&#13;
hardcore and murram. They also contributed money to buying food for builders, cooking for artisans and assisting in&#13;
construction as well as taking over complete control of subsequent management, operation and maintenance. In all&#13;
communities, however, there were a few individuals who had not fully accepted the water system as their own. This is&#13;
because they still saw these systems as gifts that donors can replace if the need arises. Some of them felt that they&#13;
should have got something better.&#13;

o All target groups in each community have access to reliable water.&#13;
o Selling of water, using kitchen gardening and tree nursery planting has widened the choices of income&#13;
generating activities.&#13;
&#149; Extensive behavioral change has been realized in communities (Mwembeni and Mwenengo) that used open&#13;
water sources and have turned to protected ones for drinking, cooking and washing utensils, all&#13;
categories of members reverted to use the bush contrary to before the project when they used&#13;
ordinary latrines.&#13;
o The project has provided information to households to improve their latrines.&#13;
o Hand washing after defecation is practiced throughout all the communities.&#13;
o Behavioral change in relation to sanitation and hygiene practices was the highest in Mwenengo Community.&#13;
OnstFutgon2a       arrzngements&#13;
The water committees were not all together always well informed as officials and local leaders cross-examined one&#13;
another on several areas in the management of their water systems. The water committees lacked a viable institution&#13;
with which to pursue further development suggestions or seek guidance on some pertinent technical issues including&#13;
sanitary technology, rising prices of less durable spare parts and absence of an authority or institution with which to&#13;
discuss these problems.&#13;
All the above constraints can be attributed to weaknesses of the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy to&#13;
demystify itself from the central role at district level. Another major setback is the inability to create a working&#13;
relationship with community projects, lack of extension services to grassroots ministry of Water Resources and weak&#13;
committee management systems that often lack direction.&#13;
Lssons Le!rn(d and Best Pirvnkes&#13;

and demand responsive approaches.                o Communities make informed choices towards&#13;
sustainability with responsibility.&#13;
o Gender balanced participatory approaches are&#13;
promoted and utilized throughout the project cycle.&#13;
o The project has an in-built income-generating&#13;
component while at the same time incorporating&#13;
social services.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Water management committees should be revitalized through capacity building initiatives.&#13;
* The sanitation component in the district should be revisited - more effort to ensure success in&#13;
district.&#13;
* Women and men irrespective of socio-economic status should be encouraged to participate in&#13;
non-traditional roles.&#13;
* There should be greater integration of water and sanitation component in projects with Ministry of&#13;
Health in the forefront in promotion of environmental sanitation.&#13;
* Technical advice and regular follow up (monitoring) by parent ministry should be enhanced.&#13;
* Institutional arrangements should be given greater emphasis as necessary conditions for&#13;
sustainability of water and sanitation projects.&#13;
* Private sector initiatives should be supported with the aim of creating and enhancing a district base&#13;
of operation and maintenance capacity to service the hand-pump technology.&#13;
* PLA as an assessment method should be adapted to suit different conditions and promoted within&#13;
local set-ups and additional quantitative data from a larger sample should be collected for statistical&#13;
extrapolation.&#13;
* Structural bottlenecks that hamper integration and creativity should be streamlined to enable the&#13;
different shareholders contribute to the promotion of participation, gender, poverty focus and&#13;
sustainability in water and sanitation projects.&#13;
* The instituted Gender Steering Committee under the patronage of the Department of Water&#13;
Development in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources should be revitalized to provide&#13;
guidance on the follow up action for integration of DRA, gender and poverty sensitive approaches in&#13;
the WSS sector.&#13;
* The Gender Assessment Committee (GAC) or PLA Team should be pursue dissemination of the&#13;
assessment findings to the Rural Water and Sanitation Working Group in the Department of Water&#13;
Development and or the Sanitation Working Group in the Ministry of Health with the aim of&#13;
defining a strategy on the Way Forward.&#13;
PLA assessment conducted in four communities in Kwale revealed several opportunities and challenges&#13;
for government agencies, donors, policy makers, project implementers and beneficiary communities.-This&#13;
assessment outlined the importance of community participation, gender, poverty focus and demand&#13;
responsiveness in ensuring project sustainability.&#13;

            This field note is a consolidation of
            the substantive issues arising from Kenya Gender Assessments
            that were part of the global Participatory Learning and
            Action (PLA) assessments undertaken in Latin America, Asia
            and Africa (Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Zambia). The
            Gender Working Group of the Water Supply and Sanitation
            Collaborative Council, the Water and Sanitation Program in
            collaboration with the International Water and Sanitation
            Center (IRC) and sector agencies, initiated PLA. The
            assessment examined the linkages between the use of
            Demand-Responsive, Gender and Poverty sensitive approaches
            in design and implementation of water and sanitation
            programs and the overall impact and sustainability. In
