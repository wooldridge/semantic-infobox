    BOX 1: THE ROPE PUMP&#13;
&#13;
    The principal elements of the rope pump are a pulley wheel, a rope with pistons attached, a pipe that enters the well,&#13;
    and at the base of this pipe, a guidance device for the rope. As the crankshaft is turned the rope drags the pistons up&#13;
    the pipe, trapping the water above them and ejecting it at the surface. The pump functions well at groundwater depths&#13;
    of up to 50 meters.&#13;
    Due to the simple and sturdy design of the pump, maintenance needs are very limited and can easily be handled by&#13;
    the community or local artisan. The rope itself is the most likely part to break down, and can either be easily and&#13;
    cheaply replaced locally or patched up without difficulty. Makeshift repairs do not significantly detract from&#13;
    pump performance.&#13;

            The rope pump : private sector technology
            transfer from Nicaragua to Ghana
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Nicaraguan rope pump has stimulated
            widespread interest throughout Central America due to its
            low cost, efficiency, durability and low maintenance needs.
            The pump is based on a centuries-old design that was refined
            during the 1980s and 1990s. Suit-able for use at either a
            community or family level, the pump operates as well as
            other, more expensive pumps such as the Afridev and India
            Mark II at groundwater depths of up to 50 meters. The Swiss
            Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), seeing the
            potential for South-South technology transfer of the pump,
            supported the principal Nicaraguan manufacturer, Bombas De
            Mecate S.A. (BOMESA), in setting up a Technology Transfer
            Center between 1996 and 1998. Working with counterparts in
            the West African country of Ghana, supported by the Water
            and Sanitation Program (WSP), BOMESA has successfully
            established the capacity to both produce and install the
            pump in that country. The experience has shown the great
            potential for such a transfer to bring a low-cost, reliable
            pump to countries where handpumps can help meet the
            challenge of delivering sustainable rural water supply.
