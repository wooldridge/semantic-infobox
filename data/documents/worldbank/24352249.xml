      Note: The Millennium Development Goals and targets come from the Millennium Declaration, signed by 189 countries, including 147 heads of state and government, in September&#13;
      2000 (www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm) as updated by the 60th UN General Assembly in September 2005. The revised Millennium Development Goal (MDG) monitoring&#13;
      framework shown here, including new targets and indicators, was presented to the 62nd General Assembly, with new numbering as recommended by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on&#13;
      MDG Indicators at its 12th meeting on November 14, 2007. The goals and targets are interrelated and should be seen as a whole. They represent a partnership between the developed&#13;
      countries and the developing countries â&#128;&#156;to create an environmentâ&#128;&#148;at the national and global levels alikeâ&#128;&#148;which is conducive to development and the elimination of poverty.â&#128;&#157; All indicators&#13;
      should be disaggregated by sex and urban-rural location as far as possible.&#13;

            World Development Indicators 2015
            provides a compilation of relevant, high quality, and
            internationally comparable statistics about global
            development and the fight against poverty. It is intended to
            help policymakers, students, analysts, professors, program
            managers, and citizens find and use data related to all
            aspects of development, including those that help monitor
            progress toward the World Bank Group&#146;s two goals of ending
            poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Six themes are used
            to organize indicators: world view, people, environment,
            economy, states and markets, and global links. As in past
            editions, World Development Indicators reviews global
            progress toward the Millennium Development Goals and
            provides key indicators related to poverty. WDI 2015
            includes: a selection of the most popular indicators across
            214 economies and 14 country groups organized into six WDI
            themes; thematic and regional highlights, providing an
            overview of global development trends; an in-depth review of
            the progress made toward achieving the Millennium
            Development Goals; and a user guide describing resources
            available online and on mobile apps. A complementary online
            data analysis tool is available this year to allow readers
            to further investigate global, regional, and country
            progress on the MDGs: data.worldbank.org/mdgs. Each of the
            remaining sections includes an introduction; six stories
            highlighting specific global, regional or country trends;
            and a table of the most relevant and popular indicators for
            that theme, together with a discussion of indicator
            compilation methodology.
