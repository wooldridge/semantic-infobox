            Water services in Chile - comparing private
            and public performance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 1988, Chile put in place a new
            regulatory regime for water and sanitation, allowing rates
            to reflect the actual cost of providing services. The
            government then reorganized the sector under 13 state-owned
            regional water companies and, in 1998, started to partially
            privatize some of them. Four years after the first sale, it
            is now possible to assess the early results of
            privatization. This Note examines the outcomes for
            investors, and consumers, and compares the performance of
            the privatized companies with that of companies remaining
            under state ownership.
