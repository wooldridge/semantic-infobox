&amp;#12;                       Interview with Edward Jaycox&#13;
                               The World Bank&#13;
                             February 23, 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I'm Lou Galambos,        of    the Johns Hopkins University and&#13;
&#13;
the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I'm Kim Jaycox, Vice President, Africa Region, The World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I'm Jochen Kraske, the Bank's Historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And I'm David Milobsky, the Assistant to the Historian.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      I understand you went to Yale University. What was your&#13;
&#13;
class at Yale?&#13;
&#13;
A:      '59 and I went to Pearson College.&#13;
&#13;
         I majored in history. I took military history.                     I   took&#13;
&#13;
probably diplomatic history.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Sam "wave      the   flag"    Beamis,   was    still a     Professor of&#13;
&#13;
History?.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Right.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      My job was to stand at the back of the class and throw&#13;
&#13;
anyone    out    who   smoked.       Sam was    of    the   old   school,       threw&#13;
&#13;
anybody out who smoked, and wouldn't let anyone come into the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Jaycox, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
lectures late. We had to intervene between Sam and the hundred&#13;
&#13;
students who would be taking this big lecture.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I    didn't    take that course.         I   was in Directed Studies,&#13;
&#13;
and later in this honors program in American Studies, which&#13;
&#13;
meant I could take anything I wanted in the university and it&#13;
&#13;
counted.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      So let's go back before Yale. Were there aspects of your&#13;
&#13;
family life that would be interesting.&#13;
&#13;
A:      My    father    was   an   executive         with   Firestone   Tire   and&#13;
&#13;
Rubber Company, and my mother was editor of a newspaper in the&#13;
&#13;
Knight-Ridder chain.          We lived in Akron, Ohio, which was the&#13;
&#13;
headquarters of Firestone, and I was born in Cleveland. also--&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What year were you born?&#13;
&#13;
A:      1938. My grandfather was also from Akron and we spent&#13;
&#13;
most of our times in the summers living on a farm which became&#13;
&#13;
gentrified over time.          When I first went there it was pigs and&#13;
&#13;
cows    and later       it was     lawns   and       flower gardens.    It was   a&#13;
&#13;
beautiful place on a lake.            I have a sister a couple of years&#13;
&#13;
younger than I.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You are the oldest one?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Jaycox, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
A:      I     am    the    oldest   child   and   oldest   grandchild     in   this&#13;
&#13;
extended family.             The whole family lived there sort of on a&#13;
&#13;
compound,          like an African extended family,         I had six cousins&#13;
&#13;
and   three        aunts    and uncles,     three   different   families,         and&#13;
&#13;
cousins       and     grandfather     and   grandmother,     that   was    just     a&#13;
&#13;
tribal kind of an existence.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Since your mother was an editor the family gave a                      fair&#13;
&#13;
amount of emphasis to education.                  So you did well in school.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Not always.          Finally, though, I did very well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It sounds a bit like me.             So you were in mischief for a&#13;
&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I    had an endearing nickname, Dynamite, which applied to&#13;
&#13;
my temper,          that my grandfather thought up.           This was a       good&#13;
&#13;
environment because if you were in trouble in one house you&#13;
&#13;
sort of went over              to   the other place.       You were       taken    in&#13;
&#13;
because you were family.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Did you like sports?&#13;
&#13;
A:          I was a very good swimmer.            And I also sailed and rode&#13;
&#13;
horses.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You were in secondary school then, there?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Jaycox, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
A:     My father was transferred from Ohio to Pennsylvania and&#13;
&#13;
we went to a little town called Pottstown, Pennsylvania,                        and&#13;
&#13;
that was the place where one of the best prep schools in the&#13;
&#13;
United States was located, the Hill School.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Were there particular subjects, things you began to like&#13;
&#13;
at that point?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well,    I    was very much into philosophy and history and&#13;
&#13;
literature. I was at the top of my class.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you have any family ties to Yale University?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. My father went to Columbia University and my mother&#13;
&#13;
went    to    Smith      College.     My   grandfather   only went       to   sixth&#13;
&#13;
grade. Q: That's the American story.&#13;
&#13;
A:       At    Yale,       I   was    in   this   Directed     Studies    program,&#13;
&#13;
basically a         repeat of what I'd done.         This was Literature I,&#13;
&#13;
History I, Philosophy I, Political Science I, Economics I, and&#13;
&#13;
the    idea was all of          these      things were somehow coordinated,&#13;
&#13;
team-taught         by   the   best   professors    in   the    university,     for&#13;
&#13;
freshmen and sophomores.               It was a    two-year deal.        And then&#13;
&#13;
after that you'd go into your major for two years.                       So I went&#13;
&#13;
from Directed Studies to Self-directed Studies, but they had&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
the   same kind of        coordination between subjects.                  I   had an&#13;
&#13;
advisor who helped me with decisions.&#13;
&#13;
      I became very interested in Africa during this period.                        I&#13;
&#13;
was on an American campus when, in the late '50s, it was clear&#13;
&#13;
that Africa was moving toward independence,                     that practically&#13;
&#13;
nobody in the United States knew anything about Africa.                             I&#13;
&#13;
probably knew more than most because my father worked with&#13;
&#13;
Firestone in big black plantations in Nigeria,                      in Liberia,     I&#13;
&#13;
had met Africans in Akron all the time.                   There were students&#13;
&#13;
in rubber chemistry, heads of state even would come to Akron&#13;
&#13;
and would visit my house.              I was a naive person, and had all&#13;
&#13;
kinds of ideas about colonialism and the potential of Africa,&#13;
&#13;
which had been bottled up as a result of colonialism. We were&#13;
&#13;
getting    steamed up        about    the   colonial      process     and     looking&#13;
&#13;
forward    to    the   end    of   the   colonial       period.       I   was   very&#13;
&#13;
idealistic at the time.              How many people knew anything about&#13;
&#13;
Africa in all of North America?                I had this idea that I would&#13;
&#13;
be involved in the opening up of Africa to private investment,&#13;
&#13;
and   to   business    relationships        of    a    more    legitimate     nature&#13;
&#13;
between    the    North      and     Africa,     and    that    I   could      advise&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Jaycox, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
governments. But I was at that stage where I didn't know the&#13;
&#13;
geography,    the culture. There was no real set of courses on&#13;
&#13;
Africa   at     Yale        at   the       time.         So    this   was       just         an&#13;
&#13;
extracurricular thing.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    They did have area studies                    I   thought at that           time.       I&#13;
&#13;
know there were on Asia.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Yes, of course.            But that was a long-standing tradition.&#13;
&#13;
 There was nothing that           I   remember about Africa at Yale.                   I   was&#13;
&#13;
taking six courses instead of five at Yale because                          I   was also&#13;
&#13;
in the military.        The Navy paid my way through Yale, so                      I       owed&#13;
&#13;
them my summers and I             owed them three years of active duty&#13;
&#13;
after my graduation and commissioning.&#13;
&#13;
      Anyway,    there weren't any good courses about Africa.&#13;
&#13;
The library was available and                 I    used it, but that was about&#13;
&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Were there African students?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Very    few.     In    fact,     I    can't       even   remember     one    in       my&#13;
&#13;
class.&#13;
&#13;
      Then I served in the Navy for four years.                       I was in when&#13;
&#13;
the Berlin Crisis came up and everybody got extended in their&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
obligations, but I maintained my interest in Africa and when I&#13;
&#13;
was about to leave I applied to graduate school.&#13;
&#13;
      After my commissioning, I went to sea three summers in a&#13;
&#13;
row, on all kinds of ships, but my assignment as an ensign was&#13;
&#13;
to the aircraft carrier Valley Forge,                   stationed in Norfolk,&#13;
&#13;
Virginia. At the time I        joined it was an old-fashioned attack&#13;
&#13;
carrier.      Between take-off and landing you had to move all&#13;
&#13;
these planes around so that you could take them on board.                         And&#13;
&#13;
we went through, almost immediately, the reassignment to anti-&#13;
&#13;
submarine work, and that's where I                spent most of my time in&#13;
&#13;
the   North Atlantic     and    the   Caribbean.             We were     always    in&#13;
&#13;
contact with the "enemy" and at General Quarters, like it was&#13;
&#13;
for   real,    because   it    was    for    real.           We   were   basically&#13;
&#13;
following     Russian    submarines         off       from    Iceland     to     Cape&#13;
&#13;
Canaveral,     between   the   Florida Straits           and Cuba.           We were&#13;
&#13;
maintaining surveillance on these guys, and force them to the&#13;
&#13;
surface.      We always carried several scientists and everybody&#13;
                                                                                        ~   .l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
else trying to figure out how to do this job better.                         I had a&#13;
&#13;
lot   of    people   assigned    to    me,        a   big    division,       learned&#13;
&#13;
everything about that ship.            By the time I              left it,     it had&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Jaycox, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
changed its mission again to an attack carrier, an amphibious&#13;
&#13;
assault.       We shifted to Subic Bay,              north of Manila,          getting&#13;
&#13;
involved with Vietnam,              we had Marines and helicopters.                   By&#13;
&#13;
that time, I was one of the few officers who had come through&#13;
&#13;
these    changes       of mission,       and    I   ended up having         the     Ship&#13;
&#13;
bosun's job.       I was the only guy on that ship who knew how to&#13;
&#13;
anchor it. I also learned to handle a large number of people,&#13;
&#13;
because I       had six or seven hundred people reporting to me.&#13;
&#13;
Generally the bosun's job is looked up to by all,                          including&#13;
&#13;
the captain.           That wasn't quite my case.               These guys didn't&#13;
&#13;
appreciate it.          And then I got out of the Navy in Vietnam.                     I&#13;
&#13;
was put ashore in Saigon and from there, the ship went on some&#13;
&#13;
extended maneuvers-&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What year was that?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Late    '63.    They       put   me    to   work   in    the    cryptography&#13;
&#13;
business and I handled communications for the Embassy, coding&#13;
&#13;
and decoding messages.               I was only there for about a month,&#13;
&#13;
while my time ran out and my ship was on maneuvers, which they&#13;
&#13;
didn't    want    me     to   go    on because       I   was    not    going   to   see&#13;
&#13;
through.        So I returned to the U.S.                and demobilized in San&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Jaycox, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
Francisco.     I     went   directly    to     graduate     school    with     a&#13;
&#13;
fellowship.        I was married and I had a child and--&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You got married when?&#13;
&#13;
A:   While I was in the Navy to my boyhood sweetheart,                       and&#13;
&#13;
we've been together ever since for 34 years.&#13;
&#13;
So when I got out of the Navy I was very focused and that is&#13;
&#13;
when I concentrated on Africa. I had never heard of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank, by the way, up to this point.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was        in 1963,     and you were going to New York              to&#13;
&#13;
Columbia University. How did you manage?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I had my fellowship and a little help from my parents to&#13;
&#13;
cover the rent of our apartment. So we made it barely. During&#13;
&#13;
the summers I worked.           But actually I went to school, too, so&#13;
&#13;
it was a very hard time for us while I was there.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now     had    you   taken   courses    in    economics    and   economic&#13;
&#13;
development?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I'd     had    undergraduate     courses      in   economics.    I'd    had&#13;
&#13;
Money and Banking, Trade Theory,             National Accounts.       I wasn't&#13;
&#13;
particularly drawn to economics.               I   was more drawn,     if you&#13;
&#13;
will, to business.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Jaycox, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
Q:        So at Columbia were there particular courses that were&#13;
&#13;
really influential or you--?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I     took       economics     and   business      courses      from     Albert&#13;
&#13;
Hirschman,        Peter    Kennan,    Professor     Benoit,     and    courses     in&#13;
&#13;
public       administration           or     international           affairs      and&#13;
&#13;
international law.            Leonard Bloch taught us this.              There was&#13;
&#13;
also a     course in business law,           dealing with investments.              I&#13;
&#13;
also took a complete additional course, in African Studies. It&#13;
&#13;
was   a    fairly      superficial    current     events     course.    There    was&#13;
&#13;
little on African history and very little on African culture.&#13;
&#13;
The   people      did not     know what      they    were    talking    about     and&#13;
&#13;
concepts     of     African    history      and   culture     were    still    being&#13;
&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Right.&#13;
&#13;
A:    So    you     learned    a   little    of   20th   century      history     and&#13;
&#13;
what's going on politically,               the nature of the states,            what&#13;
&#13;
are   people       claiming    and   declaiming      about    the    single     party&#13;
&#13;
systems.      And by '63, most of these countries had become self-&#13;
&#13;
governing         or      quasi-independent         or      fought     to      become&#13;
&#13;
independent.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Jaycox, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
        When I was in the Navy, by the way,              there was one event&#13;
&#13;
which impressed me greatly. My wife-to-be was at Wellesley and&#13;
&#13;
I went up there from Norfolk for the weekend and met Julius&#13;
&#13;
Nyerere, who later became the President of Tanzania, and who&#13;
&#13;
gave a lecture at Wellesley.              I had a chance to speak to him&#13;
&#13;
briefly, and it was all very inspiring.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    A lot of the history at that point was still colonial&#13;
&#13;
history, wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.    It was all written from the records and the point&#13;
&#13;
of   view of      the   colonial    powers.         There were      a   few party&#13;
&#13;
manifestos and biographies of the new leaders and the books&#13;
&#13;
they had written.          Nkrumah had written a book.                  There was&#13;
&#13;
quite a bit in the French language, because by 1960 a lot of&#13;
&#13;
these      countries     had     become     fully     independent       and   that&#13;
&#13;
experience was being recorded in French literature, including&#13;
&#13;
a    lot   of   very    heavy,    hefty    critiques     of    independence     in&#13;
&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
        --Bad Start in Africa,            for    instance,    was   an important&#13;
&#13;
book.      But it was slim picking.             When I finally came close to&#13;
&#13;
graduation I won a fellowship to travel in Africa, and I did.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Jaycox, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
I    left my wife and my child with her parents in Akron, Ohio&#13;
&#13;
and spent five and a half, six months traveling around Africa.&#13;
&#13;
I did most of it on the ground;           I hitchhiked.&#13;
&#13;
This was between the end of April and the first of October of&#13;
&#13;
'64, and on the 5th of October I joined the World Bank.                  I had&#13;
&#13;
already been chosen to join the Bank in the spring.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You learned about the Bank at Columbia, I suppose?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I learned about the Bank at Columbia and I realized that&#13;
&#13;
my dream of doing this on my own was just total nonsense. In&#13;
&#13;
fact    there were very few actors working in Africa with any&#13;
&#13;
sort of knowledge base and, as far as I was concerned the only&#13;
&#13;
one in North America was the World Bank, and maybe outfits in&#13;
&#13;
Europe I didn't know about.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You   didn't   think    about    going     into   business   at    this&#13;
&#13;
point?&#13;
&#13;
A:     My    father-in-law    was   the   chief     executive   officer     of&#13;
&#13;
Goodyear and my uncle was the head of another rubber company,&#13;
&#13;
and my father was retired by then, but he had been very high&#13;
&#13;
up in the Firestone company.           I was the belle of the ball.          I&#13;
&#13;
can tell you I got offers from everybody to stay in Akron and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
raise my kids in Akron in the shadow of the factory,                     the way&#13;
&#13;
we had grown up.&#13;
&#13;
           These   companies     were    home-owned,       home-grown,    home-&#13;
&#13;
managed.      There was no New York money or managers.               Of course,&#13;
&#13;
now they are all owned by the Japanese. But my parents and my&#13;
&#13;
parents-in-law could never meet because the Feds were on them&#13;
&#13;
all the time for price fixing and collusion between the major&#13;
&#13;
manufacturers.      We could not have a wedding in Akron because&#13;
&#13;
we couldn't have guest           lists   that would mingle.           A social&#13;
&#13;
event like that would have had more Federal officers watching&#13;
&#13;
and listening that would have come to that than anybody else,&#13;
&#13;
so we eloped to Maine. This was just a strange period in time&#13;
&#13;
when    the    anti-trust       were     after     these     industries     like&#13;
&#13;
automobiles ad rubber,          concentrated in particular towns.             You&#13;
&#13;
know, everybody joined the same country club, went to the same&#13;
&#13;
restaurant, the same church.&#13;
&#13;
       And so these guys were trying to make a Federal case out&#13;
&#13;
of   everything.    I   don't    think    my     relatives    were   guilty    of&#13;
&#13;
anything but they could not behave in a normal way.                       That's&#13;
&#13;
one of the reasons I did not want to stay.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So then you learned about the Bank and about this Young&#13;
&#13;
Professionals Programs?&#13;
&#13;
A:     While   I   was at   Columbia     I     learned about       this program&#13;
&#13;
and, I think, one of my professors thought it was much in line&#13;
&#13;
with what      I   seemed   to   want   to     do with my      talents,   so   I&#13;
&#13;
applied.&#13;
&#13;
I had to come to Washington and people came to see me, and all&#13;
&#13;
kinds of screening and looking at recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Had you done much work in languages up to that point?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No. I had studied French in a very North American way.&#13;
&#13;
I    found that after years of studying French,                reading French&#13;
&#13;
literature and all that,          I   could not communicate in French,&#13;
&#13;
and I was embarrassed to be so childlike in French. Obviously,&#13;
&#13;
that sort of reinforced my inability.                 But lately I've gotten&#13;
&#13;
beyond that.       I've had a French instructor for 12 years.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Well, that's very helpful.             But there weren't any African&#13;
&#13;
languages taught in the program ?&#13;
&#13;
A:     There was     Swahili,    but    this    was    just   an   introductory&#13;
&#13;
course.    We used that Foreign Service language book, the buff&#13;
&#13;
colored Swahili book with the American eagle on the cover,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
that covered talking about food and transport, talking to your&#13;
&#13;
driver and your maid or things of that sort.&#13;
&#13;
-Q:   Diseases.&#13;
&#13;
A:    I   forgot diseases.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    So you were going to move to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
A:    We moved        to Washington,        and my wife was pregnant with&#13;
&#13;
our   second        daughter    when   we   moved.         So   I   had   to   go    to&#13;
&#13;
Washington ahead of her. I picked the wrong house in the wrong&#13;
&#13;
neighborhood.         I'd been gone for seven months, left this woman&#13;
&#13;
big with child, and I was in big trouble on the home front as&#13;
&#13;
we moved to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    So give us your impressions of the Bank.                      You were coming&#13;
&#13;
in as a young professional.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Well,     I    was   impressed with the Bank.             I   had worked      for&#13;
&#13;
private    business        in   the    summers.    I   had      been   working      for&#13;
&#13;
Goodyear and had a rather privileged position when my father-&#13;
&#13;
in-law    was       running     the    place,     so   I     had    all   kinds      of&#13;
&#13;
advantages.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    What sort of advantages?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Jaycox, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
A:      I    saw the best           side   of    the Goodyear Tire and Rubber&#13;
&#13;
Company, but I felt that the World Bank was a much more solid,&#13;
&#13;
much        better       managed,     less      bureaucratic,     more   responsive&#13;
&#13;
institution than any place I'd ever been. I was impressed with&#13;
&#13;
the    people        I   met   including my        fellow young professionals.&#13;
&#13;
There were only 13 of us, and we had one member who was Greek,&#13;
&#13;
named Philocles Ascimakis, more interesting than the others.&#13;
&#13;
Within about three weeks he had an assignment that required&#13;
&#13;
him to take something off a transcript of a Board meeting. We&#13;
&#13;
had a Secretary called Mort Mendels, a nice, elegant man who&#13;
&#13;
clearly knew his way around the world. Ascimakis kept calling&#13;
&#13;
up there and never getting an answer back, so he goes marching&#13;
&#13;
up to the Secretary's office                      this was the equivalent of a&#13;
&#13;
Vice President -- brushes past the secretary,                       goes into the&#13;
&#13;
guy's inner office, takes out his I.D. card, plunks it down on&#13;
&#13;
the desk and says,                "Did you sign this?".         Mort Mendels looks&#13;
&#13;
up and says,             "Yeah,    that's my signature on there.           Who are&#13;
&#13;
you?"        And he said, "Never mind who I am.                 If you've got time&#13;
&#13;
to    sign these goddamned things but not to return my phone&#13;
&#13;
calls, what kind of an outfit is this?"                         The Secretary just&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Jaycox, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
threw him out of his office.                 And within a week he was gone.&#13;
&#13;
We saw Philocles again two annual meetings later when he came&#13;
&#13;
in very proud of himself, a big Greek banker.&#13;
&#13;
       Another one of our members, was traded for a                           tractor.&#13;
&#13;
What was his name? Jose Andreu. He arrived as a YP a little&#13;
&#13;
late     because     he       had     just   been    released     by     the     Castro&#13;
&#13;
government following the Bay of Pigs invasion in exchange for&#13;
&#13;
a tractor, and he had been in the front lines.                     And there were&#13;
&#13;
people    like Jochen.              Jochen hasn' t    changed a        bit.     A very&#13;
&#13;
impressive fellow.            He looks like this.           He's 30 years old or&#13;
&#13;
less, already bald and big and I was very impressed with the&#13;
&#13;
colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     What did you actually do in the program?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Basically we were outcasts.                We came together as a group&#13;
&#13;
on the same day.          I    was    in the third group,         but it was        the&#13;
&#13;
second     year.      We       were    given   some     minor     orientation       and&#13;
&#13;
assignments immediately. But nobody paid any attention to us,&#13;
&#13;
even though this may have varied from one place to another. I&#13;
&#13;
was sent to the Africa Region, at my request, but they did not&#13;
&#13;
have     time   to   deal      with    somebody      like   me.    I     didn' t   know&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Jaycox, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
anything. I was a decade younger than anybody else around,            26&#13;
&#13;
years old.   Not everyone was familiar with the YP Program, and&#13;
&#13;
the old professionals         I don't know if they felt threatened&#13;
&#13;
-- but they certainly did not think that they had anything to&#13;
&#13;
gain by associating with us.&#13;
&#13;
     We    used   to   meet   in   the   lunch   room   always   sitting&#13;
&#13;
together   because nobody     else would have      lunch with us.    We&#13;
&#13;
never got invited by anybody. So it was very cliquey, and we&#13;
&#13;
created our own atmosphere.        But we helped each other a lot.&#13;
&#13;
People would call me when they wanted to know something about&#13;
&#13;
private investment issues which I had studied.            I would call&#13;
&#13;
somebody when I needed some help with some agronomics problem.&#13;
&#13;
I remember that people like Werner Hammel from Germany, Werner&#13;
&#13;
Schick from Switzerland, Armin Rose from Spain, were extremely&#13;
&#13;
helpful to me.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   They gave you a desk in the Africa department?&#13;
&#13;
A:   They gave me a desk, but I had no windows. I had a desk&#13;
&#13;
and I had a file cabinet.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   With nothing in it?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Jaycox, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
A:   l'b&amp; files were with me,           so everybody who wanted to get&#13;
&#13;
anything had to come in and introduce themselves anyway.                    This&#13;
&#13;
was helpful.&#13;
&#13;
     One day I was reading the phone book because that turned&#13;
&#13;
out to be the most informative single document about the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank you can get your hands on.           It shows the organization, it&#13;
&#13;
shows who is doing what to whom and how, and answers a lot of&#13;
&#13;
questions     about    the   organization.   But,   anyway,    I'm       reading&#13;
&#13;
this thing and the Deputy Director of the Africa Department,&#13;
&#13;
John Williams,         sticks his head in and says,       "Who are you?"&#13;
&#13;
and I say, "Well, I've been here for three weeks." So he says,&#13;
&#13;
"And you haven't got anything better to do than read the phone&#13;
&#13;
book?"    I   said,    "That's right.     As a matter of fact,           I am so&#13;
&#13;
annoyed   that    nobody is     giving me    any work   that     I       want   to&#13;
&#13;
transfer to some place where there is some action.&#13;
&#13;
         So I    was   transferred from the Ethiopian-Somalia-Sudan&#13;
&#13;
division and shifted to Hursit Chalika's group, which was the&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania-Kenya-Uganda division.            It was   fantastic,       a    lot of&#13;
&#13;
projects, activity, attractive countries.            So I was happy and&#13;
&#13;
overworked.      And that's the way it has been ever since.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Jaycox, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
Q:       What did they give you to do?&#13;
&#13;
A:       The first thing I did was to negotiate a tea operation.&#13;
&#13;
     I   knew   the    physical       terrain     but     I    had    not   appraised    a&#13;
&#13;
project.        I was a loan officer.            I was the person in charge of&#13;
&#13;
certain operations.            I    was one of the two loan officers,                   so&#13;
&#13;
there was        a    lot of       activity.      And I        was    a member of   the&#13;
&#13;
working party who would deliberate and decide on every letter&#13;
&#13;
written,        economic report received,               supervision and appraisal&#13;
&#13;
mission. I got a good reputation for being on the ball, hard-&#13;
&#13;
nosed yet sympathetic. I became a trusted member of the team&#13;
&#13;
very quickly, and gained a lot of experience in that process.&#13;
&#13;
I made many visits to that part of the world as a member of&#13;
&#13;
economic and appraisal missions.&#13;
&#13;
          Actually this division went all the way to Zambia and&#13;
&#13;
included Malawi.          After six months I got                   transferred, in line&#13;
&#13;
with      the   rules of       the Y. P.       Program,       to    the Transportation&#13;
&#13;
Projects Division of                the   Technical Operations Department.&#13;
&#13;
Sort of the inner sanctum. This is like being the ship's bosun&#13;
&#13;
again. This is where the crusty characters are the ones who&#13;
&#13;
got mud all over them.                Engineers          and         agronomists,   but&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Jaycox, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
mostly engineers.          I was not really an economist but that â&#128;¢ s&#13;
&#13;
what I was doing.         I was sent out on an appraisal mission to&#13;
&#13;
Malawi, for a road project.             This was my second 'mission there,&#13;
&#13;
and   I    went   with     an    engineer,       another        YP     on     his        first&#13;
&#13;
assignment, Bernard Cire(?), a Frenchman. We turned down this&#13;
&#13;
road project, one of three we were looking at,                          and this one&#13;
&#13;
happened     to   be     going    to    the     border     of        Zambia,        by     the&#13;
&#13;
President's private.farm.              And this was the most interesting&#13;
&#13;
one for him.      To announce our findings on this mission, we had&#13;
&#13;
to see President Banda.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    He   was    then    President     there.         Malawi        must     have        just&#13;
&#13;
become independent.&#13;
&#13;
A:    Just    independent.        So    this     was     early         '65,    and         the&#13;
&#13;
Federation had just broken up.                There were no statistics.                   The&#13;
&#13;
engineer was a friend of mine, but did not have any stomach&#13;
&#13;
for going to see the old man and saying nix on this project,&#13;
&#13;
so the day before we had an appointment to see the President&#13;
&#13;
to report on the outcome of our mission,                        he announces              that&#13;
&#13;
he's got to go, and he's on the next plane out.                          You and this&#13;
&#13;
YP can handle this.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Jaycox, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Right. Did you feel like a lamb going to the slaughter?&#13;
&#13;
A:      So the French YP and I marched in to see the President,&#13;
&#13;
who is on this little platform, so he can look down on us, and&#13;
&#13;
we are sitting there to announce the results of our appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
So I give him the whole thing about how at present we can't&#13;
&#13;
get a positive rate of return, and the project is at least ten&#13;
&#13;
years    off.      The     President       grips   the    arms    of       his   throne,&#13;
&#13;
staggers to his feet and reaches out toward me like he hasn't&#13;
&#13;
taken a breath for a while,              topples off this pedestal toward&#13;
&#13;
me, and I think "Oh, my God, they are going to take us out and&#13;
&#13;
shoot us".        This guy was definitely in his late 60s, but he&#13;
&#13;
already looked like Methuselah.&#13;
&#13;
        We had to be extracted from the                   room.        He    said    "I'm&#13;
&#13;
coming to Washington.            I    will see this thing to the bitter&#13;
&#13;
end."        We were out of there.           And of course I've seen him a&#13;
&#13;
dozen times since, and he remembers this very well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      He remembered you.&#13;
&#13;
A:      So    that was our first meeting.                Anyway,       I    found    this&#13;
&#13;
very    heady     stuff    and   to   be    working      in   Africa        with    these&#13;
&#13;
emergent       countries    in   these      very   difficult       situations        was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
really something that I felt I wanted to do.                        But then I got&#13;
&#13;
into management and transferred all over the Bank and all over&#13;
&#13;
the world.       It has been ten years since I've been back to&#13;
&#13;
Africa now.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Had    they   already       indicated        to   you    that   you   had   an&#13;
&#13;
appointment in the Bank,                 or were you on sort of probation&#13;
&#13;
while you were in this program?&#13;
&#13;
A:     The rule was that you would be given a                       job after this&#13;
&#13;
initial      training      period.       And   it   would      be   exceptional    if&#13;
&#13;
somebody was not given a permanent assignment. We were chosen&#13;
&#13;
people, constantly coddled by the people who were in charge of&#13;
&#13;
us in the administration.                We went on strike at one point.&#13;
&#13;
We had a wage dispute with the Bank.                      In fact,     we were the&#13;
&#13;
last    group   to    join    as     a    group.    We    surmised     we    had   the&#13;
&#13;
solidarity in order to actually challenge the administration.&#13;
&#13;
     I was one of the spokesmen and a guy named Christian Merat,&#13;
&#13;
 from France, was another. We went to see whoever it was in&#13;
&#13;
charge of us,        Mr.    Van Wagenen or Mr.            Ahmed,       or Reginald&#13;
&#13;
Clark, Jim Twining, these were the names I remember. We said,&#13;
&#13;
"Look, we cannot live on our salaries,                   they are too low." My&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Jaycox, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
salary at the time was $6600 net, not even $600 a month take-&#13;
&#13;
home pay.       I was married,       I had a house,        a mortgage,        I    lived&#13;
&#13;
out in the suburbs, I had to take the bus every day.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Inflation had started.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Lunch was 65 cents.            We didn't deserve to be so poor.&#13;
&#13;
So   in   the    end    they    agreed     with    us    and   gave    us     each    an&#13;
&#13;
additional $100 a month, which was an amazing accomplishment.&#13;
&#13;
 We got immediately a 15 percent raise.                    But the Bank was on&#13;
&#13;
warning     that       they    did   not    want    to    have    these       wildcat&#13;
&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     So now you've moved into a regular position.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I was in Transportation.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     That was your choice at the time?&#13;
&#13;
A:     That was my choice.            I was assigned to Africa.                   It was&#13;
&#13;
more   real     than working on country relations,                    this    sort    of&#13;
&#13;
diplomatic stuff which didn't deliver anything.                         Thatâ&#128;¢ s      the&#13;
&#13;
way I looked at it at the time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     In many cases          there was     a   strain between the            country&#13;
&#13;
people    and     the    engineers,      the    project    people.      You       didn't&#13;
&#13;
experience that.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Jaycox, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
A:    We experienced it because we,               the sector people,           always&#13;
&#13;
felt it was very important to get these projects right. It was&#13;
&#13;
not    a     question    of     just   transferring       resources,     but     also&#13;
&#13;
technology       and    infrastructure.      In    the    eyes     of   the    sector&#13;
&#13;
people,      these diplomats were just a bunch of crowd pleasers.&#13;
&#13;
This is an extreme statement, but it describes the culture of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank at the time, and, it's been with us ever since.&#13;
&#13;
       My personal opinion at the time was that this was not a&#13;
&#13;
serious       conflict        and   that   country       relations      were     very&#13;
&#13;
important. I         thought that the context of the projects was one&#13;
&#13;
of    the most       important      design variables,       that    there was     no&#13;
&#13;
standard sectoral answer to any problem and that any solution&#13;
&#13;
had to be quite specifically tailored to,                    who was going to&#13;
&#13;
maintain it, run it, argue the case for funds for it, and so&#13;
&#13;
forth.        But    the Technical      Operations       Department     called    the&#13;
&#13;
shots.       It was a very powerful technical team, and relatively&#13;
&#13;
more powerful than the country economists or the loan officers&#13;
&#13;
who    had    this     sympathetic     country     orientation      without      much&#13;
&#13;
business.        These persons became more sympathetic to country&#13;
&#13;
idiosyncracies and politics because                 they couldn't        trust us,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Jaycox, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
the sectoral pur:i,.sts who were trying to solve all problems&#13;
&#13;
like some technical equation,                  to have any sensitivity to it,&#13;
&#13;
so in effect the gulf widened.&#13;
&#13;
        There         were   a   few      of   us,   mostly      YPs    almost     all&#13;
&#13;
generalists. We would try to modify all this stuff so that it&#13;
&#13;
would be more responsive, more responsible.&#13;
&#13;
        I   think during this time the Bank began to become more&#13;
&#13;
and     more          dysfunctional     because      of   this     pulling       apart&#13;
&#13;
phenomenon.            The volume of business grew to the point where&#13;
&#13;
the amount of attention that the working party could actually&#13;
&#13;
give to individual operations became somewhat diminished.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, we are still under Woods?&#13;
&#13;
A:      The volume of lending was going up and also there was an&#13;
&#13;
effort           to    use   more      sophisticated      methods       of   project&#13;
&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
        In the Transport Sector,               for instance, we began to use&#13;
&#13;
rate of return calculations.                   A few of us, the economists in&#13;
&#13;
the Transport division, actually pioneered it.                         We calculated&#13;
&#13;
rates       of    return on      roads.    Say    there   is   some    saving    on   a&#13;
&#13;
vehicle operation, there is a benefit. It generated additional&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Jaycox, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
traffic. There is a big jump in traffic after you improve the&#13;
&#13;
road,      so   you   could   take    credit   for   half    of   the   savings.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we were quantifying things,              and this tended to make&#13;
&#13;
for    a   more   sophisticated analysis.            A little bit later we&#13;
&#13;
introduced risk analysis and we began to use simulations and&#13;
&#13;
computer-based methods.              That was all during my time in the&#13;
&#13;
Transportation division.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Who was directly in charge of you at this point?&#13;
&#13;
A:      warren Baum was       the Director of Transportation.               There&#13;
&#13;
were also couple of Assistant Directors.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      How would you describe his managerial style?&#13;
&#13;
A:      He was my mentor, very conservative.                That's number one.&#13;
&#13;
 But that was a real challenge because he is a very reasonable&#13;
&#13;
man.       He was very supportive of staff, and his conservativism&#13;
&#13;
was always there hanging out as a               challenge for people who&#13;
&#13;
wanted to do things differently and more creatively.                    I   think&#13;
&#13;
in those particular days the Transportation Projects Division&#13;
&#13;
of the TOD, which later became a department itself under his&#13;
&#13;
direction, was really one of the most creative parts of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.      A lot of the future directors and vice presidents came&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Jaycox, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
through there .      Certainly most of the innovations in project&#13;
&#13;
analysis,      including          shadow    pricing      and      all     this&#13;
&#13;
sophistication,          came    originally out    of   the Transportation&#13;
&#13;
Department, and Herman Van der Tak and Jean de Weille, Arthur&#13;
&#13;
Wubnik, led the charge.&#13;
&#13;
        Those were of course economists, none of them engineers.&#13;
&#13;
 Warren Baum himself was an economist who had transferred from&#13;
&#13;
the area department.&#13;
&#13;
        He had been a division chief in Latin America.             In a way,&#13;
&#13;
Warren Baum was sort of a precursor of the YPs taking over the&#13;
&#13;
Bank,    an example of the country economist who moved into the&#13;
&#13;
Technical Department,           and was successful as a director.           He&#13;
&#13;
was     followed    by    David    Knox,   who    had   exactly    the    same&#13;
&#13;
background.        And much later      there were people        like me and&#13;
&#13;
Wilfried Thalwitz, who became directors of Transportation.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It sounds like a good bit of this innovation is bubbling&#13;
&#13;
up, not coming down.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Before McNamara it was definitely bubbling up.                  And of&#13;
&#13;
course the interesting thing is that you would do it without&#13;
&#13;
delaying anything.          That was the challenge.            There were no&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Jaycox, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
barriers on trying anything out,                    but the point is you didn't&#13;
&#13;
want to make these innovations at the cost of the customer, so&#13;
&#13;
you   had          to    do   it without   holding     up   the   project.       I   can&#13;
&#13;
remember how hard we worked,                long hours, hauling computers to&#13;
&#13;
our houses. We jammed the phones with these little devices so&#13;
&#13;
we could run these programs until, some advisor was screaming&#13;
&#13;
bloody murder becaused the phone was off the hook for three&#13;
&#13;
days in a row. By the end we had a simulation of the Mogadishu&#13;
&#13;
port with risk analysis and queuing,                    algorithms,       great heady&#13;
&#13;
stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Was         there     any   type   of   a    division     of     labor   within&#13;
&#13;
Transportation?                It seems like you are talking mostly about&#13;
&#13;
roads in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well,           that was the case at first, but then I was looking&#13;
&#13;
after       the revenue earning parts.                That was     the railways;       I&#13;
&#13;
became the Division Chief for Railways.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      This was in 1969?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I   69 â&#128;¢        And I had been in the Bank five years,              and I was&#13;
&#13;
31 years old, and I was running a railway division, where the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Jaycox, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
average age was about 62.         And these were all engineers,            of&#13;
&#13;
such standing, and such rigidity.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   There must have been empployees who were awfully nervous&#13;
&#13;
about the new approaches to project evaluation?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   But I    remember how quickly they got on board.&#13;
&#13;
Frank Higginbottam was a port engineer who went with me to&#13;
&#13;
Mogadishu. We were determined to use this simulation tool, to&#13;
&#13;
determine    the    additional   berths   required    for    the   port   of&#13;
&#13;
Mogadishu. The question was whether it was possible to move&#13;
&#13;
bananas from a port 120 kilometers south, sort of a surf port,&#13;
&#13;
Marka is the name of the place,           and divert this traffic to&#13;
&#13;
Mogadishu 120 kilometers to the north.            This would allow to&#13;
&#13;
load the bananas at the key where the loading costs were going&#13;
&#13;
to be a fraction.      But the port engineer forgot about the 120&#13;
&#13;
kilometers. Would the bananas actually be diverted, because if&#13;
&#13;
they were then we got a justified port?              And we proved that&#13;
&#13;
diverting the bananas was the last thing you wanted to do,&#13;
&#13;
because by    the    time you got    a    ton   of bananas    across      the&#13;
&#13;
Mogadishu port, you only saved a buck a ton.                But for other&#13;
&#13;
traffic crossing the port of Mogadishu you saved $9 a ton, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         Jaycox, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
so if the opportunity cost was $9 and we were only going to&#13;
&#13;
get $1 cost savings by diverting the bananas, much less than&#13;
&#13;
the    cost   of    bringing       the   bananas       to    Mogadishu.       So   it    was&#13;
&#13;
better to leave the bananas in Marka and make sure that the&#13;
&#13;
capacity of Mogadishu was                available          for       the growth traffic&#13;
&#13;
that would come and you'd save $9 a ton.&#13;
&#13;
       As soon as this guy saw that answer he was furious.                                He&#13;
&#13;
thought,      "My God,      you have      torpedoed this               entire project.&#13;
&#13;
This   is ridiculous."             We said,    "Now,         wait a minute,          Frank,&#13;
&#13;
think about it . "          So he calmed down and thought about it and&#13;
&#13;
said, "You know, you are right."               It was totally justified and&#13;
&#13;
we changed the logic of the project.                         We did not divert the&#13;
&#13;
bananas from Marka, which was a good thing we didn't do.                                 The&#13;
&#13;
guy    converted       completely.          This       was        a    55-year-old      port&#13;
&#13;
engineer.         We built our reputation on that project.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Tell me, first, you haven't mentioned in all of this, we&#13;
&#13;
are    in   the    early    '60s   and into    the mid-' 60s,              that was      the&#13;
&#13;
Kennedy era .         Did that have any impact on you?                         People     in&#13;
&#13;
corporate America worked long hours, mainly because they knew&#13;
&#13;
they were going            to   climb    rapidly   -        they were motivated by&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Jaycox, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
material          objectives.     You       were       motivated      by   non-material&#13;
&#13;
objectives          by   excitement          about       your      work      which     was&#13;
&#13;
characteristic of the 1960's.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I   think in the early '60s most of the young people in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank were extremely interested in career aspects.                            I mean&#13;
&#13;
by that the involvement in major problems on a world scale,&#13;
&#13;
i.e.,       the    difference    between         the    rich    and    the   poor,     the&#13;
&#13;
developing          countries    and       the   developed       countries.      To    be&#13;
&#13;
involved with a premier institution, on the cutting edge and&#13;
&#13;
inventing new tools and looking at things in new ways,                                this&#13;
&#13;
was     really      wonderful.         I   don't       think    anybody would         have&#13;
&#13;
willingly traded in those days                     for a    corporate career.            I&#13;
&#13;
think the motivations were very strong.&#13;
&#13;
        Kennedy,      of course, was dead by the time I got to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.        I    was actually at Columbia,               in Manhattan,        had    just&#13;
&#13;
arrived there when he was assassinated.                         I'm sure this had a&#13;
&#13;
psychological effect on me.                 I probably repressed a lot of it.&#13;
&#13;
 I remember when I was going around Africa hitchhiking,                               they&#13;
&#13;
had just minted this 50-cent piece with Kennedy's portrait on&#13;
&#13;
it,   and I        took a whole bag of those,              and I got out of more&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Jaycox, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
trouble by handing out one of those things to people trying to&#13;
&#13;
make my way around Africa.                   It worked always like magic all&#13;
&#13;
around      the world.      I       don't    know whether non-Americans              were&#13;
&#13;
motivated,       amongst my colleagues at the Bank,                  but the Bank&#13;
&#13;
made     sense     in    that        whole       context.   It   was      a     service&#13;
&#13;
institution,       working at one of the major problems,                       in line&#13;
&#13;
very much with what we think Western democracies should be up&#13;
&#13;
to.    It was a time when there was very little cynicism about&#13;
&#13;
any    of   that   stuff.            The    Vietnam war     of   course       was    also&#13;
&#13;
becoming a major feature of our environment and having quite&#13;
&#13;
an opposite effect on a lot of things,                      including making our&#13;
&#13;
job a lot more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     In what way?&#13;
&#13;
A:     By      creating         a      financial       environment        that       was&#13;
&#13;
unmanageable worldwide, and having a tremendous impact on the&#13;
&#13;
developing world.         There was no way that they could manage.&#13;
&#13;
When I      think about what we are going through now,                         all    the&#13;
&#13;
adjustments and the structural adjustments and the impact on&#13;
&#13;
Africa,     the commodity price fluctuations,                the debt situation,&#13;
&#13;
the    shift     from   negative            to   positive   interest   rates,         the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Jaycox, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
disinflation in the United States has had a lot to do with all&#13;
&#13;
that.        And this was necessary because of the earlier inflation&#13;
&#13;
brought on by the bad economic policy in the United States&#13;
&#13;
during the Vietnam war. So that inflation was there quietly,&#13;
&#13;
working its way, undermining what we were doing all this time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now you were working in Transportation and innovating in&#13;
&#13;
an area where there was a sense that you could measure things&#13;
&#13;
like the return on your investment. Yet, the Bank at this time&#13;
&#13;
was     beginning        to   shift   attention     toward     projects    in&#13;
&#13;
agriculture        and   education    that   were   different.     Were   you&#13;
&#13;
involved, were you feeling any effects of this shift?&#13;
&#13;
A:       I    don't   think we were    tempted in education to do an&#13;
&#13;
economic rate of return in the classic sense.                    Some people&#13;
&#13;
toyed with the idea, but they never gained any credibility so&#13;
&#13;
we.didn't pursue it very far. We never managed to get anywhere&#13;
&#13;
with that.&#13;
&#13;
        Everybody knew that education was valuable, and it was a&#13;
&#13;
question of cost-effectiveness and efficiency that had to be&#13;
&#13;
paid attention to.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
      In the case of agriculture,                   I    always thought we did a&#13;
&#13;
hard-nosed        rate    of     return.      We    worked with         farm   budgets,&#13;
&#13;
systems      of    production,           transport,      exports,    tax       incentive&#13;
&#13;
systems,     we worked with the financial institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    You didn't think there was any real difference between&#13;
&#13;
these various types of different sectors?&#13;
&#13;
A:    No.     I must say I didn't pay a lot of attention to what&#13;
&#13;
was happening in these other sectors until a lot later. But I&#13;
&#13;
have a feeling that the general sophistication of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
methodology was taking place in the late '60s, before McNamara&#13;
&#13;
arrived.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now,        in     the    particular        area    you    were     working      in&#13;
&#13;
Transportation.           What kind of obstacles were you encountering&#13;
&#13;
as   far    as     your    projects        were    concerned?       What       were   you&#13;
&#13;
experiencing?          Take yourself back into that time.                 How are you&#13;
&#13;
perceiving the problems, particularly in Africa?&#13;
&#13;
A:    One     problem          was   a   predilection       to   invest        in   over-&#13;
&#13;
designed infrastructure. There was a lot of donor response to&#13;
&#13;
that, white elephants or premature investments. We attempted&#13;
&#13;
to slow this down, so it would not become a big burden on the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               Jaycox, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
future that could not be paid.               And looking back on all the&#13;
&#13;
OED reviews of the projects that were done in those days, I'd&#13;
&#13;
say we overdid it.      My view is the rates of return on what we&#13;
&#13;
did were much too high in any event,                  which means they were&#13;
&#13;
late,    under-designed,   and there were others that should and&#13;
&#13;
could have been done with very adequate rates of return, but&#13;
&#13;
we turned them down because we were very conservative.                        That&#13;
&#13;
is one thing.&#13;
&#13;
        The second thing in Transport, we never did get a handle&#13;
&#13;
on the rural infrastructure,           rural roads,       feeder roads.        We&#13;
&#13;
could not deal with the idea of taking risk, and typically we&#13;
&#13;
did never build a new road.             If we had a choice, we always&#13;
&#13;
upgraded an existing road.             Some of these were really foot&#13;
&#13;
paths but they had already generated enough traffic so that we&#13;
&#13;
could become      interested in       them as    roads.      We would invest&#13;
&#13;
where    others   had   taken    the    risk,    their       risk    panned    out&#13;
&#13;
positively, and we would reinforce it. But we would never take&#13;
&#13;
the development risk. The question then is, where should the&#13;
&#13;
development     institution come       in?    Should we       come    later    and&#13;
&#13;
reinforce,    rather    than    get    out    front    and    really work       on&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Jaycox, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
bringing new land into production,                       introducing new products,&#13;
&#13;
connecting people with the rest of                       the country.        If you fly&#13;
&#13;
across the United States you see, roads every mile in a grid.&#13;
&#13;
 It had something to do with the Homestead Act,                              but it was&#13;
&#13;
basically a       grid pattern that was                  laid out      to open up        the&#13;
&#13;
country. You were going to build a road here,                            this is where&#13;
&#13;
the road goes,          and that's it.            Your house is going to go in&#13;
&#13;
that corner, and that's it.                   That's the way this country was&#13;
&#13;
developed.         If    it    had    not     been    done,      we    would    still      be&#13;
&#13;
wondering what          the    hell    is     wrong with         the middle      of     this&#13;
&#13;
country.         But    we    are    not     in   that    business      so     that   is    a&#13;
&#13;
problem.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now,   you were of course at that point dealing with the&#13;
&#13;
whole world,       you were not just confined in Africa--&#13;
&#13;
A:     I   was    dealing       with        Africa.        We    had    three     highway&#13;
&#13;
divisions.       When I was a deputy division chief for highways in&#13;
&#13;
'67,   I   was assigned to Highways 2,                   and it was all Africa.&#13;
&#13;
When I was in the Railways Division I was dealing across the&#13;
&#13;
different     regions.        But     the    project      work    I    did   myself     was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
exclusively in Africa.          I don't think I appraised any project&#13;
&#13;
that was outside of Africa between '64 and, and '69.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you       perceive   that   there   were    any    differences    in&#13;
&#13;
treatment of projects in Africa as,            say, compared to Asia at&#13;
&#13;
that point?&#13;
&#13;
A:     No.    The methodology was exactly the same, absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
It was interesting the way the African highway division was&#13;
&#13;
run because everybody would come in and we would discuss every&#13;
&#13;
aspect of every project.          We would comment on the reports of&#13;
&#13;
others.      We did not do a lot of loans but we really did very&#13;
&#13;
thorough work on every one that we did, and the results were&#13;
&#13;
very   good     in    Africa.     Road   building     was    absolutely     the&#13;
&#13;
greatest investment that we have supported.              I cannot think of&#13;
&#13;
one failure in a road investment.          Surely, the pavement failed&#13;
&#13;
but that's because,        of the volume of traffic or the lack of&#13;
&#13;
compliance with load limits. But, by God, the traffic that was&#13;
&#13;
carried on these roads was enormous.            They paid for themselves&#13;
&#13;
many    times    over.      And   they   are   still    one     of   the   best&#13;
&#13;
investments you can get.          From an economic point of view I&#13;
&#13;
think infrastructure is extremely important.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Jaycox, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
        That    was    demonstrated        in    the   '60s,    and     was   the    World&#13;
&#13;
Bank's stock in trade, but i t became very routine. It was not&#13;
&#13;
the cutting edge.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What about          the obstacles       from    the African side?             What&#13;
&#13;
are you learning about that in this process?&#13;
&#13;
A:      On     the    African     side,     there      is    this   tendency        toward&#13;
&#13;
grandiosity that I've already mentioned, and the donors played&#13;
&#13;
into that.           The other thing was the lack of capacity and the&#13;
&#13;
reliance upon foreigners             for most of            the management and the&#13;
&#13;
critical       intellectual       inputs.       Looking back,       I    had a      lot   of&#13;
&#13;
resistance       to    trying     to Africanize        the     highway departments,&#13;
&#13;
and     the railway managements.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      From the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.     Because the Africans wanted to do this,                      they were&#13;
&#13;
doing i t too fast. They were doing it haphazardly, or were not&#13;
&#13;
doing i t in a          planned and appropriate way.                    They were     just&#13;
&#13;
turning over          these assets        to people who didn't             know how       to&#13;
&#13;
manage       them,    and    this was not acceptable             to anybody on our&#13;
&#13;
side.        But we were not building up a pipeline of engineers to&#13;
&#13;
take    over,        were   not   investing      in    engineering        training,       in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
overseas training of engineers, in motivating the talent that&#13;
&#13;
existed.     There was   the    "stand back,     let me do it,          I   know&#13;
&#13;
better" attitude. And this is still the case.                    We are still&#13;
&#13;
doing    highway projects       in Africa where            they don't   have    a&#13;
&#13;
highway department.      Yet,    the creation of a sound indigenous&#13;
&#13;
institution should have been the first order of business.&#13;
&#13;
      We were not applying what we learned.                  I am not holding&#13;
&#13;
the Africans responsible. I think they were victimized by this&#13;
&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
        People    were   interested      in     solving        transportation&#13;
&#13;
problems.        They wanted    to   build    roads.         The business      of&#13;
&#13;
building a highway department is really somebody else's. And,&#13;
&#13;
of course, it was much more difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      So you are in this activity when Robert McNamara becomes&#13;
&#13;
the President of the World Bank.         How does this impact on you?&#13;
&#13;
 A:      I   really could not believe it.              I    remember somebody&#13;
&#13;
telling me this might happen and I said, "No, this will never,&#13;
&#13;
how could this guy come over here?" I             had just resigned my&#13;
&#13;
commission in the U.S. Navy over Vietnam, and I was upset with&#13;
&#13;
everything that was happening,         and the idea of this defense&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Jaycox, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
minister with blood all over him to come over here to run this&#13;
&#13;
Bank,       I    tell you it didn't go down with me one bit.                      I    was&#13;
&#13;
very negative about              it.    I     couldn't believe it.      I   was       in a&#13;
&#13;
total state of shock.                  And,    of course,   we got to know more&#13;
&#13;
about his philosophical position. I suppose when he took over&#13;
&#13;
in April,            1968, we were a        little bit out of shock and in a&#13;
&#13;
different mode.               This emphasis on quantification, monitoring&#13;
&#13;
results and setting high objectives was quite attractive for&#13;
&#13;
the younger people around here.                   We thought here is a guy who&#13;
&#13;
is going to use the tools that we have lately acquired while&#13;
&#13;
most everybody else is 30 years away from school. We were only&#13;
&#13;
five or six and we were at least likely to keep up with this&#13;
&#13;
guy     so      we    could   contribute.         And,   indeed,   he   moved         very&#13;
&#13;
quickly and promoted a lot of young people.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      How soon does this more positive aspect begin to filter&#13;
&#13;
down, and you are beginning to get some sense of excitement?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I       think it was pretty quick.           But I remember one of the&#13;
&#13;
stories. Jim Evans was the head of the agriculture department-&#13;
&#13;
- he is was a very particular guy-- and McNamara called him&#13;
&#13;
and said "Jim,            you've been in charge of agriculture                in       the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                Jaycox, Page 42&#13;
&#13;
World Bank for the last six or seven years.                    Tell me, what do&#13;
&#13;
you think the impact of the World Bank has been on the average&#13;
&#13;
caloric intake of Indian peasants?"&#13;
&#13;
        There was no way you could possibly answer this question&#13;
&#13;
because this was not the way the Bank was run. We did not look&#13;
&#13;
at the impact of our intervention.               Our job was to turn out&#13;
&#13;
good investment projects.              And we used to have application&#13;
&#13;
forms    for projects,       you know.         They had to be         filled   out&#13;
&#13;
correctly.       If not, they were sent back.&#13;
&#13;
        [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 2]&#13;
&#13;
               But   we   were   now   going    to    expand    our   operations&#13;
&#13;
enormously.          There was a world waiting for the World Bank to&#13;
&#13;
come and put its healing hand on it.                 It was very arrogant and&#13;
&#13;
presumptuous.         But it worked.     It turned on everybody.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It was very exciting?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.     It was very exciting,          and it worked outside the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, too.       I mean, our stockholders by and large bought this.&#13;
&#13;
 There were a few rough edges.            You remember he fired a couple&#13;
&#13;
of people who said it couldn't be done, like the Treasurer. So&#13;
&#13;
he   got into a row with the Wall Street people out there. He&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  Jaycox, Page 43&#13;
&#13;
made    very    few   but   very    effective     speeches       of   a   watershed&#13;
&#13;
nature. Within the first year I think he had actually changed&#13;
&#13;
the agenda of the development business, not just the Bank.                         In&#13;
&#13;
my opinion,      this was the greatest thing.              Of course, some of&#13;
&#13;
the old-timers found this very upsetting.                        And it began to&#13;
&#13;
upset me too a little later, because instead of the bubbling&#13;
&#13;
up, there was now innovation from the top down.&#13;
&#13;
        But by and large,          there were not        too many innovative&#13;
&#13;
guys.       A lot of people felt        that McNamara had stolen their&#13;
&#13;
clothes,       was now working on poverty,           caloric intake, on big&#13;
&#13;
issues, and that this was what they were arguing all along but&#13;
&#13;
of   course     nobody would       listen    to   them   and      even     the   more&#13;
&#13;
innovative ones who were bubbling up before,                      felt threatened&#13;
&#13;
because now The Man is telling us what we were already doing&#13;
&#13;
and it was annoying and a little demeaning.&#13;
&#13;
        I   personally did     not    feel    that   but     a    lot     of   people&#13;
&#13;
around us did.        This was not an uncommon reaction.                       And of&#13;
&#13;
course we had our experience with those McNamara initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
Some of them were bad, some Okay and some very good.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 44&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Right.        But very shortly after that, you moved up rather&#13;
&#13;
quickly.&#13;
&#13;
A:    I was made Deputy Director and soon, at the time of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization I became a Director.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    You were on a fast track, did you feel,                  or did anybody&#13;
&#13;
tell you you were on a fast track?&#13;
&#13;
A:    No.      I    don't think so.          Eventually I was very aware of&#13;
&#13;
it.   I was made a Director and I was 34 years old, something&#13;
&#13;
like that.         That does not happen anymore.&#13;
&#13;
      Well,        this whole group of YPs was moving up fast,                 the&#13;
&#13;
idea of a          fast    track for    a    chosen few.   In this period,       I&#13;
&#13;
suppose     i f you were        going       to write   the history of    the   yp&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Program I     suppose you would have to say something about the&#13;
&#13;
antibodies         that    this generated,      in fact reverberate through&#13;
&#13;
this institution to this day in a different form:                       like the&#13;
&#13;
technical people versus the generalists.&#13;
&#13;
      John Blaxall,          even younger than I, was made a Director&#13;
&#13;
at that time.             He became Director of P&amp;B, or Deputy Director&#13;
&#13;
of P&amp;B, but he had one of the most powerful jobs in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 His star has since faded however. At the time he was elevated&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              Jaycox, Page 45&#13;
&#13;
out of nothing to this job, and it created a lot of internal&#13;
&#13;
difficulties. Then there was the reorganization of '72, when I&#13;
&#13;
was made a Director.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   As Deputy Director you took new responsibilities?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I had all the revenue earning aspects of Transport.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What did you have to learn at this point?                    You had to&#13;
&#13;
manage?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well,    there   were       division    chiefs    in     charge   of   the&#13;
&#13;
divisions and I was always very good at delegating, so I did&#13;
&#13;
not manage anything.         I   basically tried to ensure that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's policies were     followed,          and solve major problems         as&#13;
&#13;
they developed that went beyond the ability of my division&#13;
&#13;
chiefs to solve.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You are feeling the pressure to turn over things faster,&#13;
&#13;
before the reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Oh,     sure.     McNamara' s      position       was,     "People     are&#13;
&#13;
starving, waiting for their education,                need better health.&#13;
&#13;
We cannot afford to delay these things.               So, for God's sakes,&#13;
&#13;
get out there and help generate these projects.                    Make sure&#13;
&#13;
there is no procedural or bureaucratic delay.                 We do not have&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Jaycox, Page 46&#13;
&#13;
any competition, so we have to be driving ourselves."               He was&#13;
&#13;
kind of saying, "Look, we are trying to put America on wheels.&#13;
&#13;
 We can't afford Cadillacs here, we want Fords.            We want a lot&#13;
&#13;
of them.     We want them now.       We want them yesterday.           The&#13;
&#13;
point is action and transfer of resources.         Let's get on with&#13;
&#13;
it.   We are going to made some mistakes.          But let us not be&#13;
&#13;
perfectionistic. The second best should be good enough. Let's&#13;
&#13;
move."    And, you know, it was a very captivating message.            The&#13;
&#13;
trouble is if it completely moves in that direction so people&#13;
&#13;
don't care what they are producing, obviously you get a result&#13;
&#13;
you do not want.     I don't think it ever came to that.            There&#13;
&#13;
are people who think it did, but I don't.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    But what you were managing,      in this transition, was an&#13;
&#13;
effort to keep those taught values about how to do things?&#13;
&#13;
A:    Warren Baum had this image,       that we needed a          stockade&#13;
&#13;
fence out there,    this was after the reorganization of '72. I&#13;
&#13;
was in the middle defending the flame of Transportation and&#13;
&#13;
dealing    with   these   regional   guys   who   were     only   hearing&#13;
&#13;
McNamara saying, "deliver, deliver, deliver."            That was really&#13;
&#13;
a tough time because, our team in Transport had been cut into&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Jaycox, Page 47&#13;
&#13;
five regional pieces,      and I      was left in the middle handling&#13;
&#13;
some of the burned out managers, who had now become advisors.&#13;
&#13;
 It was very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   On a day to day basis,           it meant that there was now more&#13;
&#13;
emphasis on volume and&#13;
&#13;
A:   And on delivery.       McNamara would say: You say you need&#13;
&#13;
the resources, I am going to give you the resources but you've&#13;
&#13;
got to deliver.      You tried to save money and move back on the&#13;
&#13;
wastage   and move    up   on   the    efficiency and   eventually   find&#13;
&#13;
yourself in a bind.        You tried to move those projects,         but&#13;
&#13;
often you could not.&#13;
&#13;
     In different countries at different stages of time,              the&#13;
&#13;
absorbtive   capacity was becoming a          constraint.   Furthermore,&#13;
&#13;
the governments began to sense that it was more important for&#13;
&#13;
you to lend than for them to start the project and they took&#13;
&#13;
advantage of that.     I   did not believe that this was a major&#13;
&#13;
problem but others did. And obviously,          the situation differed&#13;
&#13;
from country to country.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Jaycox, Page 48&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But,    the      perception    that        took    hold     has      become      an&#13;
&#13;
universal kind of problem.                 What do you think led to                   this&#13;
&#13;
perception?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well,   I   thought it was always a problem on the part of&#13;
&#13;
the managers more than on the part of the directions to the&#13;
&#13;
managers.      I believe the managers were not able to cope with&#13;
&#13;
the    complexity       of   this   signal.        Managers       have      to    manage&#13;
&#13;
contradiction.          This is what they do.            Now there is a built-in&#13;
&#13;
tension, and at the extreme there is a contradiction between&#13;
&#13;
transferring the money and having quality projects.                              But the&#13;
&#13;
job of the manager is           to manage that contradiction,                     not to&#13;
&#13;
say:   "Well, I have been told to send out the money no matter&#13;
&#13;
what,"   because        he   never was      told    that,        or   II&#13;
                                                                            If    I   just&#13;
&#13;
concentrate        on    quality     and     to    hell     with      the        transfer&#13;
&#13;
operation, then I'd be totally irrelevant."&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You'd be out of a job.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I'd be out of a job for one thing, but, anyway,                            I'd be&#13;
&#13;
irrelevant.        They deliver       this    stuff so late and with                   the&#13;
&#13;
value added quite questionable, it is not clear at all that we&#13;
&#13;
need this luxury of high quality.                   We would have to change&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Jaycox, Page 49&#13;
&#13;
these projects in the real world anyway,            because the reality&#13;
&#13;
is different from what our appraisal reports speculated about.&#13;
&#13;
 In my view the managers copped out on this one, and began to&#13;
&#13;
say,    "blame it on McNamara - Blame it on the body count."             It&#13;
&#13;
became a ritualistic response to our own deficiencies.                 Now,&#13;
&#13;
that's my view, but there,       I recognize that I've never really&#13;
&#13;
been able to sell this view to most of my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But is it not in part also a systemic issue?            The system&#13;
&#13;
was based on numbers. Numbers were used as means of control.&#13;
&#13;
It was the numbers that sort of took over in the end.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes. I guess there were some real flaws. I remember when I&#13;
&#13;
moved up in the Bank I        got to be in some of these meetings,&#13;
&#13;
and McNamara never went        into a    meeting without    a     desirable&#13;
&#13;
outcome in mind, and he had already made up his mind.&#13;
&#13;
        In 90 percent of the cases it was obvious           that he had&#13;
&#13;
already made up his mind, and we were all there to chat about&#13;
&#13;
it and he was going to make sure that everybody was on board&#13;
&#13;
because we     had   to   implement   this.   And   I've   seen    him ask&#13;
&#13;
somebody, "Well, what do you think about this, John?" and then&#13;
&#13;
John would start talking and McNamara would get impatient, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Jaycox, Page 50&#13;
&#13;
grab it away from him.      Of course,    that's not where John was&#13;
&#13;
going to come out.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But John was quiet.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well,    John was   intimidated.   Nobody else said,      "I don't&#13;
&#13;
think this    is what John had in mind.        Very few people.       I&#13;
&#13;
think Peter Cargill may have been one.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But they did it in private.&#13;
&#13;
A:   And they would never do it in the group.          And this big&#13;
&#13;
mistake that was in fact done with John might get rectified&#13;
&#13;
later,    if Peter the External Affairs man,      William Clark,     or&#13;
&#13;
somebody would,    might   take him aside and say,     "Hey,    wait a&#13;
&#13;
minute.     This is," Clark would do this to him.    But, you know,&#13;
&#13;
i t took that kind of repair job.&#13;
&#13;
     And if it wasn't      too   important,   nobody would make     the&#13;
&#13;
effort and that mistake would lead to consequences that maybe&#13;
&#13;
turned out to be far more important than people thought.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You mentioned the     '72 reorganization. There you get new&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities. Tell us how the reorganization impacted on&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it was a McKinsey-driven operation.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 51&#13;
&#13;
Q:    You    thought            the    shape    of   the     organization   was   not&#13;
&#13;
already decided ahead of time?&#13;
&#13;
A:    It    probably was              decided    already because      McNamara    had&#13;
&#13;
already moved         to    implement what was going to come                 through&#13;
&#13;
process     change.        He    introduced      the    country program approach&#13;
&#13;
very quickly,     and he developed a                    few other little devices&#13;
&#13;
which basically brought                  the    focus   to   the   country programs&#13;
&#13;
side, as opposed to the TOO side of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
      He embarked upon that from the word "go" and finally in&#13;
&#13;
'72 he reorganized the Bank to make it a fact.                         He broke up&#13;
&#13;
all of the TODs into little pieces. I was in the wrong part of&#13;
&#13;
Transport. There were five regional Transportation Divisions.&#13;
&#13;
 There was no longer any differentiation between highways and&#13;
&#13;
railways, of course.                  They were all Transportation Divisions.&#13;
&#13;
 I   was    supposed to convene these guys so they didn' t                        lose&#13;
&#13;
their contact with each other but they became less and less&#13;
&#13;
amenable to my suggestions.                    They were reporting to their own&#13;
&#13;
directors - why would they come and see me. There were a lot&#13;
&#13;
of tensions.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 Jaycox, Page 52&#13;
&#13;
Q:      You were connected by a dotted line in the oganization&#13;
&#13;
chart.&#13;
&#13;
A:      I   was a dotted line.          I    hated it and I        threatened to&#13;
&#13;
quit.       But    the    Bank   was   changing       direction.     Before    the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization, it was operating at a very high cost because&#13;
&#13;
it required all this creative tension to be resolved. This was&#13;
&#13;
expensive.         Nobody could decide anything except at very high&#13;
&#13;
levels      in    the management.      So     the   reorganization became      an&#13;
&#13;
inevitability.           The Bank had to be reorganized in order to&#13;
&#13;
stop this high cost inefficiency that had been developed by&#13;
&#13;
the process change without reorganization.                   And that is the&#13;
&#13;
same    thing that happened in              '87.    It was exactly the same&#13;
&#13;
pattern with a different urgency.                   The Organization catching&#13;
&#13;
up with the reality which had already been changed by the&#13;
&#13;
managers. I do not think the '72 reorganization had any impact&#13;
&#13;
on the staff numbers. There may have been some people who quit&#13;
&#13;
in a huff but I don't remember.               The point was that this was a&#13;
&#13;
reorganization, not a downsizing, not a budget cutting thing&#13;
&#13;
of   any kind.           And it was not        a    skills mix    adjustment   or&#13;
&#13;
anything.         Because McNamara was expanding the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    Jaycox, Page 53&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      But engineering went down, and economists went up.&#13;
&#13;
     A:      I   think      the   articulate       country   strategist,    both     the&#13;
&#13;
     country economist and the generalist,                   people who could make&#13;
&#13;
     articulate cases in writing and in presentations, got elevated&#13;
&#13;
     by this process.             And as the critical mass on the technical&#13;
&#13;
     side had been broken into five pieces,                  everybody had to have&#13;
&#13;
     their generalists, because they competed for resources on the&#13;
&#13;
     basis       of   the    glibness      and     the   persuasiveness     of     these&#13;
&#13;
     generalists, not on the strengths of their technical staff.                       I&#13;
&#13;
     could be the generalist for the Transportation Department, but&#13;
&#13;
     now they need five of               them to cover the waterfront,           or six&#13;
&#13;
     even because I was at the center. I needed my own generalists&#13;
&#13;
     in order to defend my budget and my resource program.                       You had&#13;
&#13;
     to have this ability to argue your case.                    The budget became&#13;
&#13;
     the     central     point     for    all    empowerment.      That's    why     the&#13;
&#13;
     elevation of John Blaxall,              I mentioned, was such a challenge&#13;
&#13;
     to the system,         because he was young and kind of ruthless as&#13;
&#13;
     only young people can be.                  The budget process became a          15-&#13;
&#13;
     month process.         And it       took us    longer   to develop    the budget&#13;
&#13;
     than to spend it.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Jaycox, Page 54&#13;
&#13;
Q:      By '72, the process of innovation which was, as we said,&#13;
&#13;
bubbling up before, was it bubbling down now almost all the&#13;
&#13;
time?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Coming    out   of    McNamara,     backed    up       by   William    Clark,&#13;
&#13;
Hollis    Chenery,      one   or    two   others,     including Ernie          Stern,&#13;
&#13;
Burke Knapp. Burke became custodian of the old way of doing&#13;
&#13;
business,      sort of the relationship banker.                     Numbers did not&#13;
&#13;
mean a whole lot to Burke. He saw the Bank with a human face,&#13;
&#13;
or the management with a human face.                   But McNamara became a&#13;
&#13;
mentor    of     mine   and   I    became   promoted.      I    was    given       every&#13;
&#13;
support     by McNamara       so,    I    see   his   strengths.        It    is   only&#13;
&#13;
recently I've begun to put more perspective on his presidency.&#13;
&#13;
I    think most     people        yearn   for   the   day when we            had more&#13;
&#13;
direction from above because the old bubbling process is not&#13;
&#13;
working any more.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It hasn't resuscitated.&#13;
&#13;
A:      It hasn't resuscitated.&#13;

            On February 23, March 9, April 27 and
            May 24, 1995, Edward V. K. Jaycox was interviewed on behalf
            of the World Bank Group Archives oral history program by
            Jochen Kraske and Lou Galambos. During his tenure at the
            Bank from 1964 to 1996, Mr. Jaycox worked in the following
            areas: as director in the transportation projects department
            (1972-1973), the transportation and urban projects
            department (1973-1976), the water and urban development
            department (1977-1979), and the East Asia and Pacific (EAP)
            country programs department (1979-1984); and as vice
            president in both the eastern Africa region (1984-1987) and
            the Africa region (1987-1996). He discusses the
            reorganization of the World Bank under Robert McNamara and
            how the new objectives weakened or compromised functions of
            the World Bank because employees did not get the cultural
            changes for which they were aiming. His transcript also
            concerns projects in Africa, the board of directors, and accountability.
