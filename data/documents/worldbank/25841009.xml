&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 2012, the World Bank initiated the Building Urban Resilience in East Asia program, aimed&#13;
at increasing the resilience of cities to disasters and the impact of climate change by using a&#13;
risk-based approach to making public investment decisions. The objective is to demonstrate&#13;
a scalable methodology and practical tools for risk assessment that can be used for city-level&#13;
investment decisions. As part of this program, a book entitled â&#128;&#156;Building Urban Resilience:&#13;
Principles, Tools and Practiceâ&#128;&#157; was published in 2013, providing a framework to implement&#13;
urban resilience activities. With the support from East Asia Infrastructure for Growth (EAIG),&#13;
a regional trust fund supported by the Australian Government, an activity was conducted to&#13;
experiment with the implementation of this framework in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
This activity started with engaging selected cities that have reasonable complexity and are&#13;
experiencing significant growth. The next step involved conversations about disaster and&#13;
climate risks confronting the cities and the options that they could consider in building&#13;
resilience. The result of this experiment is presented in this book. It is hoped that this will be&#13;
the first in a series of publications on the development and adaptation of principles, tools and&#13;
practices for urban resilience in the Indonesian context.&#13;
&#13;
The book begins with two chapters on the disaster and climate vulnerabilities in the context&#13;
of Indonesian cities, and the basic framework developed by the World Bank Building Urban&#13;
Resilience in East Asia program. The subsequent two chapters describe the Rapid Risk&#13;
Diagnostic as the first step in the urban resilience engagement, and the summary of the&#13;
diagnostic findings in selected Indonesian cities. The final chapter provides a glimpse of how&#13;
options to invest in resilience can be materialized in practice as part of a cityâ&#128;&#153;s development.&#13;
Presented with many visuals, maps and illustrations, we hope the book will be enjoyable and&#13;
informative for urban development practitioners.&#13;

                                                                                                     1&#13;
&amp;#12;    1.   URBANIZATION AND DISASTER&#13;
         AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITIES&#13;
         IN INDONESIA&#13;
&#13;
         With an average annual urbanization rate estimated at 4.1% between&#13;
         2000 and 2010, Indonesia is one of the most urbanized countries in Asia.&#13;
         Its urban population, 54% in 2010, is projected to reach 68% by 2025.&#13;
         Rapid urbanization leads to dense settlements and a concentration of&#13;
         critical infrastructure. It is estimated that at least 110 million people in&#13;
         60 Indonesian cities are regularly exposed to natural hazards, including&#13;
         tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, as well as disasters related to climate&#13;
         change.&#13;
&#13;
         Urbanization offers opportunities for Indonesia, potentially boosting&#13;
         regional economic growth and creating vibrant cities and metropolitan&#13;
         areas. Urbanization and the agglomeration economies that it generates&#13;
         are an important element in Indonesiaâ&#128;&#152;s development as a middle-&#13;
         income country. If managed properly, urbanization can generate positive&#13;
         returns that create opportunities for economic growth, poverty reduction&#13;
         and shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
         City management may lack core competencies to manage sustainable&#13;
         urbanization, as indicated by the many Indonesian cities developing&#13;
         without a disaster risk perspective. This can lead to increasing&#13;
         occurences of annual disasters and a higher than average death toll of&#13;
         urban residents.&#13;
&#13;
         In addition, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s citiesâ&#128;&#153; resilience to natural disasters has been&#13;
         weakened by the rapid construction of physical assets in urban areas&#13;
         amid weak enforcement of building codes and zoning regulations.&#13;
         Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s fast-paced, and not always well-planned, construction of&#13;
         physical assets has seen demand for urban housing and commercial&#13;
         facilities multiply over the past decade. Since weak enforcement of&#13;
         spatial planning regulations are common, real estate and construction&#13;
         activities are prone to deliver structures of substandard quality.&#13;

    of the number of disaster-impacted buildings and houses over the&#13;
    past two decades. Disaster impact on housing is a useful proxy for    Total Budget&#13;
    the degree of vulnerability of urbanized areas. In the past decade    IDR 3.9 Trillions&#13;
    alone, between 20 and 50 percent of post disaster reconstruction&#13;
    budgets have been spent on housing. Statistics also show that the&#13;
    proportion of post disaster budget in 2011 was concentrated in&#13;
    urban provinces. This suggests that many assets have not been built&#13;
    to appropriate standards in the first place.&#13;

&amp;#12;    2.   FRAMEWORK fOR&#13;
         BUILDING URBAN RESILIENCE&#13;
         The rapid expansion of built-up urban areas provides an opportunity to&#13;
         develop and manage new settlements in a way that incorporate resilience&#13;
         into urban planning. The aftermath of a natural disaster can prompt&#13;
         decision-makers to push through with corrective and preventive action.&#13;
         Resilience goes beyond risk mitigation measures. It increases preparedness&#13;
         and the capacity to respond to disaster and swiftly recover from its&#13;
         impact. However, this approach is not yet seen as a part of everyday&#13;
         urban development, medium- and long-term investment planning, urban&#13;
         governance, and risk management.&#13;
&#13;
         The World Bank in East Asia and the Pacific has compiled a set of tools&#13;
         to help cities and rapidly growing urban areas to embark on urban&#13;
         resilience investment. The tools comprise of three major building blocks:&#13;
         1) Assessment and Diagnostic; 2) Resilience Measures; and 3) Enabling&#13;
         Framework. Each building block consists of distinct components as&#13;
         visualized in Figure 3, below.&#13;

interlinked and fragile components. Finally, to ensure that       natural habitats; and maintaining the&#13;
resilience building can become an integral part of urban          connectivity as well as functioning of this&#13;
management, a Disaster Risk Management framework                  natural system.&#13;
must be in place, and includes institutions, geospatial&#13;
information, and financing.                                   In practice, city managers may not have the&#13;

This Urban Resilience framework outlines three major          For example, a city may complete its land&#13;
components, namely:                                           use planning process without incorporating&#13;

1.	 Risk sensitive land use planning. This could range&#13;
                                                              on drainage. The following year that city may&#13;

    allocation and control.&#13;
                                                              flooding risk and incorporate them into their&#13;

    capacity and structural strength of key infrastructure,&#13;
    such as drainage, roads and bridges, embankments,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 7&#13;
&amp;#12;    3.   RAPID RISK Diagnostic AS A STEP&#13;
         TOWARD BUILDING URBAN RESILIENCE&#13;
&#13;
         To initiate urban resilience building efforts, risk assessment needs to be&#13;
         carried out. However, since most urban areas develop naturally, high&#13;
         resolution data -- instrumental for conducting risk assessment --are not&#13;
         usually readily available. At the same time, cities continue to grow, adding&#13;
         new areas or modifying existing ones. This potentially introduces new risks&#13;
         and vulnerabilities.&#13;
         In practice, most city governments and their residents are quite familiar with the&#13;
         occurrences of low impact and high frequency events, like floods, landslides, or&#13;
         even small earthquakes. These events are considered â&#128;&#152;normalâ&#128;&#153;, yet their causes&#13;
         and impact are not often observed properly. As the city grows, these events&#13;
         become exacerbated over time and their impact become more complex to&#13;
         analyze.&#13;
         Rapid risk diagnostic can be used to initiate a conversation between city&#13;
         officials and stakeholders on disaster and climate risks, their general&#13;
         spatial distribution, and how they influence the cityâ&#128;&#153;s growth pattern and&#13;
         trends. Using available low resolution data such as atlases, records of events&#13;
         as remembered by residents or information reports, and news on investment&#13;
         developments, specific geographic areas around natural hazards and&#13;
         investment locations can be easily pinpointed. Such rudimentary but targeted&#13;
         diagnosis, just like a general physician diagnosing illness symptoms, may&#13;
         lead to city managers having a clearer picture of issues and locations to focus&#13;
         on. More detailed and thorough risk assessments can then be conducted in&#13;
         smaller geographic areas where generating new and higher resolution data&#13;
         will be more manageable and less costly. Figure 4 illustrates the concept of risk&#13;
         diagnostic as a conversation starter for more detailed risk assessment.&#13;

&amp;#12;The diagnostic applies a simple process of compiling existing data on: (i) the citiesâ&#128;&#153; overall spatial structure,&#13;
and their growth trends and directions; (ii) the pattern of disaster occurrence and the main affected areas;&#13;
and (iii) an understanding of major urban investments being undertaken.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Development creates a dynamic and changing spatial structure, and influences the pattern and direction&#13;
of growth. Development also increases vulnerability to the environment and society. Disaster occurs&#13;
in vulnerable locations. With the knowledge of a cityâ&#128;&#153;s risk profile and resilience options, vulnerable&#13;
investments, are addressed to reduce disaster risk, decrease vulnerability, and improve spatial structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The rapid risk diagnostic preparess a cityâ&#128;&#153;s risk profile, by providing a storyline of each city in terms of location,&#13;
concentration of risks and urban investment activities, and options for integrating resilience into those on-&#13;
going urban investments. As the concept of urban resilience is relatively new, it is important that the risk&#13;
profile provide visual illustration of how a resilient city could physically look like. More importantly the city risk&#13;
profile also provide a list of measures that can be undertaken to boost resilience along the two previously-&#13;
described pillars of urban upgrading and ecosystem management/restoration.&#13;

          DIAGNOSTICS of&#13;
          6 cities&#13;
          Rapid risk diagnostics have been carried out in Indonesia&#13;
          in six medium and large cities as a pilot project. The six&#13;
          cities are: Balikpapan, Makassar, Palembang, Denpasar,&#13;
          Semarang, and Yogyakarta.&#13;

          The aim of this disaster and climate profiling is three-&#13;
          fold. First, to identify the key locations and urban&#13;
          infrastructure to be prioritized in order to create&#13;
          urban resilience. Second, to assess the prospects of&#13;
          incorporating risk reduction in urban development&#13;
          planning. Third, to provide strategy options for building&#13;
          urban resilience. The strategy options focus on three&#13;
          instruments:&#13;
          (i) risk-based land use and infrastructure investment&#13;
          planning; (ii) urban ecosystem management; and (iii)&#13;
          urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience.&#13;
          The six cities selected to pilot the diagnostic are&#13;
          combination of metropolitan and large cities in&#13;
          Indonesia. This type of city is most at risk from disaster&#13;
          and climate change due to their complex system and&#13;
          density. They face growing issues which drive risks.&#13;
          These cities experience hazard events that adversely&#13;
          affect populations.&#13;

&#13;
 16&#13;
&amp;#12;             For flood control and anticipating the rise in sea levels, Balikpapan can refer to the&#13;
             lagoon concept in Foster City, California, for the areaâ&#128;&#153;s coastal road development plan.&#13;
             Balikpapan would also benefit from the lessons learned by Brisbane in Australia, which&#13;
             used backflow prevention infrastructure as part of the integrated drainage system.&#13;
Resilience&#13;
Options&#13;
&#13;
             Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include continuing investments on&#13;
             flood control infrastructure and implementing evacuation plans in the event of flooding&#13;
             or rising sea levels (integration between the new development areas at the coast with&#13;
             the mainland). Disaster and climate risk information also needs to be strengthened to&#13;
             support risk-sensitive land use and infrastructure planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             The involvement of the community and the private sector in urban ecosystem&#13;
             management is needed for improving greenery in water catchment areas in conserving&#13;
             mangrove forests. In addition, zoning control and strict permit issuance for landslide and&#13;
             flood prone areas need to be exercised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas. The most essential infrastructure&#13;
             are: (i) seawalls for protecting coastal areas including vulnerable slums; and (ii) fire&#13;
             response paths which are developed by clearing and strengthening pathways,&#13;
             particularly on the west coast of Balikpapan Bay and in the slum areas of Klandasan Ulu.&#13;

                                                                                                          17&#13;
&amp;#12;     Learning from the success in greenery and         with rapid development and increasing&#13;
     conservation, active involvement of the           rainfall intensity. If this is the case, the&#13;

     In the upper and mid stream areas,                them into neighborhood attraction.&#13;
     Balikpapan has implemented several&#13;
     countermeasures to prevent flooding&#13;
     periodically, including river normalization,&#13;
     drainage system development and&#13;
     maintenance as well as bendali construction.&#13;
     Currently, the city is constructing its fourth&#13;
     bendali that is expected to reduce by 80&#13;
     percent the flooding of MT Haryono street.&#13;
     However, instead of declining, flooding has&#13;
     increased. The provision of such infrastructure&#13;
     should therefore be accelerated to cope&#13;

                              disaster and climate risks, particularly the rise in sea levels. The key           through&#13;
                              locations that need attention for resilience investments are Tallo and             retrofiting&#13;

 24&#13;
&amp;#12;             Most of the coastal development area in Makassar is the result of land reclamation, land&#13;
             readjustment and port facility improvement. Its development had included disaster-&#13;
             proof infrastructure such as utility tunnels and an earthquake-resistant berth. In addition,&#13;
             various cutting-edge shared utility systems help this 21st century city, such as district&#13;
             heating and cooling systems, as well as emergency underground water tanks.&#13;
Resilience&#13;
Options&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             The options for risk-based infrastructure investment planning include effective flood&#13;
             control, by managing development upstream, as well as holistic improvement of&#13;
             the drainage networks. The area is equipped with secondary and local drainage&#13;
             systems, a solid waste management system, and water infiltration mechanisms such as&#13;
             biopore, catchment wells, and rainwater harvesting. All these should be the minimum&#13;
             requirement to which developers must comply. The municipality can ask the private&#13;
             sector to build a mini polder in order to improve the quantity of water catchment areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Urban ecosystem management measure are needed, such as revitalization of mangrove&#13;
             forests in coastal areas as well as conserving forests and water catchment areas&#13;
             upstream in order to reduce sedimentation in the estuaries, particularly Tallo estuary,&#13;
             which has increased due to high land conversion. Building a number of water retention&#13;
             ponds in upstream areas of the Tallo catchment should be considered.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas above water elevated housing&#13;
             compound in riverbank and tidal prone areas. Slum infrastructure upgrading can be&#13;
             implemented by adopting the Urban Poor Consortium (UPC) model. The model has&#13;
             been tried out in several small-scale pilots in other region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading is focused on slum areas. The most essential infrastructure&#13;
             is the seawall to protect coastal activities, including slums vulnerable to sea level rise.&#13;
             Fire response paths need to be built by clearing and strengthening pathways in densely&#13;
             populated slums.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            25&#13;
&amp;#12;     Principles of sustainable coastal        Makassar needs to limit&#13;
     development should be mainstreamed       development in lowland areas.&#13;
     in planning regulations. The City        Clear and well-defined elevation&#13;
     Spatial Plan (RTRW) has outlined         standards for infrastructure and&#13;
     strategies to strengthen mitigation      reclamation are required to ensure&#13;
     and adaptation in the coastal areas.     the connectivity of drainage&#13;
     The focused areas are the west coast     systems from the mainland to the&#13;
     (Losari Beach and Centerpoint of         lowland. Other measures that will&#13;
     Indonesia), the north coast (North       help include ensuring the continuity&#13;
     Beach and Untia Beach), and the          of river normalization of the three&#13;
     riverbanks (Jeneberang, Tallo, and       main rivers (Jeneberang, Tallo, and&#13;
     Pampang).                                Pampang) and improvement of the&#13;
                                              urban canal system (pumping canal&#13;
     The strategies include:                  of Panampu and Jongaya).&#13;
     1) Revitalizing the areas through&#13;
     well-planned, controlled, and limited    Makassar should also prioritize&#13;
     reclamation activities, by complying     balancing built-up areas with&#13;
     with the regulations related to          green open space and mangrove&#13;
     mitigation and adaptation (i.e.          forests, particularly in the coastal&#13;
     sedimentation and abrasion);             and riverbank areas. In addition,&#13;
                                              groundwater use in coastal areas&#13;
     2) Stipulating elevation standards for&#13;
                                              should be limited to reduce&#13;

                                              land subsidence. Consequently,&#13;
     3) Developing drainage systems;          controlling development upstream&#13;
     4) Adopting the waterfront concept       should be part of the efforts to&#13;
     when developing coastal and              improve the function of water&#13;
     riverbank areas, by integrating built-   catchment areas, in order to control&#13;
     up areas with green open spaces and      flooding in the lowlands. This policy&#13;
     productive mangrove forests.             implementation requires effective&#13;
                                              cooperation with the upstream&#13;
                                              regions, particularly Maros and&#13;

Pattern and         Over the last decade, Palembang has experienced rapid physical development initiated&#13;
Direction of        by both the government and the private sector. Major investments are underway which&#13;
    Growth          may generate an increase in population, in supporting activities such as residential areas,&#13;
                    and trigger complex environmental and land use issues. Intensified urban activities are&#13;
                    increasing the vulnerability of Palembang.&#13;
                    Further, the urban area is expanding towards the northern and eastern part of&#13;
                    Palembang. Governmental offices and settlements initiated development in the&#13;
                    east, while residential areas expanded into the north. More recently, development&#13;
                    is gravitating towards the south, where small industries and business activities are&#13;
                    emerging. This development has become more intense with the establishment of&#13;
  28                Jakabaring, a new development center.&#13;

&amp;#12; Pattern of   Palembang is prone to two main types of hazards: flood and fire. The locations of flood&#13;
   Disaster   hazards are relatively evenly distributed across the city since Palembang was originally&#13;
Occurrences   composed from wetlands. The areas that are highly prone to flood are those located&#13;
              along Musi Riverbank. In the case of fire, the most vulnerable part is the central area. In&#13;
              addition to those hazards, localized typhoons have also hit Palembang several times,&#13;
              since deforestation had created more barren land which had caused micro climate to&#13;
              change triggering unstable local weather pattern.&#13;
&#13;
              About 7,125 hectares of Palembang are susceptible to flooding; some&#13;
              83 hectares are periodically flooded and over 7,000 hectares lowland              7,125 Ha&#13;
              and watershed areas are frequently flooded during the rainy season. The           Area&#13;
              duration of the floods is also increasing. In 2007, floods lasted only a few      regularly&#13;
              hours, but in 2013, the inundation lasted a few days. In February 2013,           flooded&#13;
              massive flooding occurred, impacting 54 villages in 9 subdistricts: Gandus,&#13;
              Ilir Barat I, Ilir Barat II, Ilir Timur I, Kemuning, Kertapati, Plaju, Seberang&#13;
              Ulu I, and Seberang Ulu II. Several public facilities and roads were affected&#13;
              as well, including Karyajaya Terminal, R. Soekamto Street, Mayor Ruslan&#13;
              Street, and May Salim Batubara Street. This indicates higher vulnerability&#13;
              and diminishing risk management capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              On average, fire events occurred 6 times a month and distributed evenly across&#13;
              Palembang. Out of 107 villages, 43 villages are prone to fire hazards. The vulnerability&#13;
              to fire is generated by the many buildings built of easily flammable material. Fire prone&#13;
              locations are across several high density commercial areas, such as Seberang Ulu I&#13;
              Village, Kelurahan 1 Ilir Village, 2 Ilir Village, 1 Ulu Village, 7 Ulu Village, 3 Ulu Village,&#13;
              and 10 Ulu Village. Palembang is also affected by the peat fire commonly occuring in the&#13;
              surrounding districts. Palembang is vulnerable due to population density and building&#13;
              conditions (particularly in slum areas), type of land use (along riverbank and wetland), as&#13;
              well as the absence of community level countermeasures in dealing with natural hazards.&#13;

&#13;
32&#13;
&amp;#12;             Palembang has already enacted Local Regulation Number 11 Year 2012, regarding&#13;
             Supervision of Wetland Utilization and Control, in order to ensure proper implementation.&#13;
             Hence the experience of Manchester City in the UK and New Jersey in the USA could&#13;
             be adopted. Manchester City revitalized the riverside through zoning control, while New&#13;
             Jersey provided incentives for voluntary conservation of wetlands. Both approaches seek&#13;
Resilience&#13;
             to balance environmental conservation with economic development, capitalizing on&#13;
Options&#13;
             wetlands as a water attraction and a a historical district for preservation.&#13;
&#13;
             Risk-based land use and infrastructure investment planning:&#13;
             The key issue for resilience of Palembang is how to capitalize flood risk zoning into multi&#13;
             spatial sub-urban retrofitting (particularly in the densely populated downtown/old city). Land&#13;
             consolidation and water management should also be integrated, in order to produce a&#13;
             canal-rich waterfront downtown with waterways as alternatives for public transportation. Also&#13;
             required is urban settlement design and housing architecture that are flood-resilient.&#13;
             Development on reclaimed wetlands should entail strict requirements on the provision of&#13;
             disaster mitigation infrastructure and of water catchment preservation, through retention&#13;
             pools, biophores, rainwater harvesting, etc. Neighborhood Development Plans (RTBL)&#13;
             are needed in areas with specific urban functions and key investments. For example, the&#13;
             Jakabaring area.&#13;
             The city needs at least an additional 30 pools through which runoff can be channeled and&#13;
             retained during peak flow periods.&#13;
             The city has also established detailed procedures for evacuation along the main corridors,&#13;
             including the development of evacuation routes and training programs, as well as facilities in&#13;
             the event of an emergency.&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience:&#13;
             Make mandatory building code requirements that minimize fire risk.&#13;
             The Municipality of Palembang has carried out various actions to control flooding, including&#13;
             river normalization, construction of retention pools, construction of retaining walls (turap), and&#13;
             formation of river diversions.&#13;
             Urban ecosystem management option:&#13;
             Located along a major river with most of the land being wetlands, Palembang has the&#13;
             opportunity to transform itself as a waterfront city. It can adopt a development approach&#13;
             that is water-sensitive, in order to maintain its ecosystem and hydrologic functions, while&#13;
             capitalizing on its natural and cultural heritage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  33&#13;
&amp;#12;     Integrated investments in reconverting      A priority investment could be for&#13;
     former wetlands into â&#128;&#156;rebuiltâ&#128;&#157; blue         the creation and improvement of the&#13;
     spaces, as well as land consolidation       canal network and waterways as new&#13;
     and settlement retrofitting could return    and alternative public transportation.&#13;

     As Palembang is expanding by                its Ampera Bridge and surrounding&#13;
     converting and reclaiming wetlands,         commercial areas on both sides&#13;

Pattern and     The city expanded from the central part of the city, which used to be the center of&#13;
Direction of    Badung Kingdom. The area then became an integrated location of trade, services&#13;
    Growth      and municipal center, and extensive growth in Sanur led to expansion in the southern&#13;
                part of Denpasar. Housing complexes, factories and warehouses proliferated in North&#13;
                Denpasar, while Margaya in West Denpasar is becoming a commercial area, in order&#13;
                to support economic spillover from tourism in Kuta, Badung District.&#13;
                A new residential area is also emerging in Gunung Talang in western Denpasar,&#13;

Today, housing complexes dominated land use of Denpasar. The expansion of settlements is clear. Of the&#13;
total land availability of 12,778 hectares, more than 61 % is used for housing, while rice fields occupy some&#13;
21 % of land, state-owned forest land take up 4.21% of land. The rest of the land is divided up as follows:&#13;
grassland has 3.10%, community forests have 0.59%, non-rice farming takes up 0.27%, fishponds comprise&#13;
0.08% of land, while the rest of the land -- 9.20% -- comprise of sands, swamps and wetlands.                                  37&#13;
&amp;#12; Pattern of   Settlement-dense Denpasar is prone to several types of hazards, including floods,&#13;
   Disaster   fire, tsunami, earthquakes, strong wind and landslides. Given the population density,&#13;
Occurrences   Denpasar is also prone to other types of disaster, such as flood-related disease outbreaks&#13;
              and poor sanitation. Denpasar is particularly vulnerable due to population density and&#13;
              land use activity near hazard prone areas. The existence of slum settlements in the city&#13;
              also contributes to vulnerability, particularly related to fire hazards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              There are 18 locations in Denpasar that are prone to&#13;
              flooding: they are across 11 villages and cover an area of       18 location&#13;
              495 hectares. Flooding occurs due to poor drainage and            Area that always&#13;
              high rainfall intensity.                                          flooded&#13;
&#13;
              Fire is the disaster that occurs most frequently, especially in highly dense settlements&#13;
              and in some commercial areas from east to south.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              As it lies on the active Australian and Indonesian plates, Denpasar has the potential of&#13;
              experiencing an earthquake and a tsunami. According to Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s earthquake index,&#13;
              Denpasar is categorized as â&#128;&#156;high-riskâ&#128;&#157;. The possibility of tsunami in Bali is high since it is&#13;
              situated in between two earthquake generators. The epicenters are likely located at the&#13;
              ocean south of Bali Island.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Landslides in Denpasar commonly occur in relatively limited areas that have steep&#13;
              slopes, such as riverbanks. However, as riverbanks are considered attractive and are&#13;
              rapidly converted into built-up spaces, they become risk areas and require serious&#13;
              attention.&#13;
              Whirlwind have also struck Denpasar several times, at speeds between 5 and 20 knots&#13;
              or about 30 kilometers per hour.&#13;

     Major                As a tourist city, Denpasar continues to prioritize development in                                           1.	 flood&#13;
     Urban                coastal areas.                                                                                                   control&#13;
Investment                The municipality routinely conducts river dredging or normalization,                                         2.	 landslide&#13;
                          particularly in areas frequently struck by flooding, such as Loloan,                                             prevention&#13;
                          Badung, and Padang Sambian. Besides those rivers, the Spatial Plan                                           3.	 River&#13;
                          (RTRW) mandates normalization in other major rivers: Ayung River,                                                dredging&#13;
                          Mati River, Buaji River, Ngejung River, along with their tributaries,&#13;
                          which function as regional and urban drainage channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40&#13;
&amp;#12;             In the medium and long term, Denpasar should focus on three measures:&#13;
             (i) flood mitigation; (ii) tsunami preparedness in tourist areas, fish processing areas,&#13;
             and high-density settlements; (iii) fire mitigation.&#13;
             Flood mitigation should be integrated with infrastructure development, with&#13;
Resilience   the river basins managed and flood-prone areas clearly designated. Coastal&#13;
Options      management, economic and social development should apply risk-based land use&#13;
             and infrastructure investment planning, by synchronizing zoning regulations.&#13;
             Balance between upstream and downstream development is also important,&#13;
             particularly as Badung District is under the framework of the Sarbagita secretariat,&#13;
             that is Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan. This joint secretariat allows for&#13;
             horizontal coordination and decision-making in other jurisdictions.&#13;
             Denpasar should also adopt a community-based fire management system, by&#13;
             providing guidelines, standard operating procedures and training for community&#13;
             volunteers and hotel association.&#13;
&#13;
             Risk-based land use and infrastructure investment planning, includes accelerating the&#13;
             implementation of comprehensive flood mitigation, ensuring controlled development&#13;
             in flood-prone areas, tsunami risk-based land use and infrastructure investment&#13;
             planning in coastal areas, as well as strengthening emergency and rescue capability&#13;
             for a â&#128;&#156;Tourist-safe Denpasarâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading for resilience means fire mitigation planning should&#13;
             be undertaken, specifically infrastructure improvement in order to improve service&#13;
             coverage and response times during fire emergencies. Evacuation planning in every&#13;
             community should be developed through a participatory approach.&#13;
&#13;
             Urban ecosystem management options: The RTRW of Denpasar specified Ngurah Rai&#13;
             Forest Park in South Denpasar as the protected coastal area with mangrove forests.&#13;
             Restoration of mangrove ecosystems along the coasts is urgently needed in order&#13;
             to simultaneously reduce the impact of abration, sea level rise, and tsunami, as well&#13;
             as offer a new tourist attraction. Denpasar could apply stricter spatial development&#13;
             controls upstream, particularly settlement development in flood and landslide prone&#13;
             zones in North and West Denpasar. One option to address this issue is to establish&#13;
             inter-region cooperation, particularly with Badung District.&#13;
             The prospects of incorporating resilience in on-going investments in Denpasar is&#13;
             promising, because the RTRW has already incorporated some resilience measures,&#13;
             particularly in response to the continuous development of the coastal areas. However,&#13;
             there is a need to integrate it with existing investments, towards comprehensive,&#13;
             water-sensitive, and tsunami-safe spatial development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        41&#13;
&amp;#12;     Honolulu, Hawaii, adhered to the Primary Urban Center Development for coastal area&#13;
     concept â&#128;&#147; and Honoluluâ&#128;&#153;s experience provides an example of balancing economic growth&#13;
     with the needs of the residents. This concept could be considered by Denpasar, in order&#13;
     to control rapid development that jeopardizes the natural ecosystem. The coastal area of&#13;
     Honolulu is also equipped with tsunami mitigation measures, including updated community-&#13;
     based evacuation plans. Denpasar could enhance its near coast ocean-floor data to&#13;
     develop more accurate evacuation plans and utilize the Banjar (traditional village) as well&#13;
     as the Pecalang (traditional safeguard) in designing evacuation plans and other mitigation&#13;
     measures&#13;

                                                    development, it is important to recognize the&#13;
                                                    challenges in inter-municipal collaboration&#13;
                                                    and development coordination. The Sarbagita&#13;
                                                    Metropolitan Area cooperation scheme needs to be&#13;
                                                    tapped, since some triggers for potential disaster&#13;
                                                    are caused by development in upstream regions,&#13;
                                                    particularly in the northern part of Badung.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42&#13;
&amp;#12;Similarly, disasters in Denpasar can impact other regions in the metropolitan area. The Sarbagita Joint&#13;
Secretariat can be empowered to foster effective multi-region cooperation in conducting seamless&#13;
risk analysis, and risk sensitive urban planning and investment. This entity can be utilized to implement&#13;
regionally comprehensive disaster-risk based land use planning and infrastructure development,&#13;
particularly to reduce the impact of land conversion in upstream regions.&#13;
The Secretariat could act as a facilitator to establish collective decision-making processes among&#13;
the local governments. Most importantly, the secretariat could initiate agreement that disaster and&#13;
climate risk reduction measures should be implemented in a synergy, through open and transparent&#13;
negotiation processes.&#13;

Pattern and          In the past, the old town area of Semarang in the cityâ&#128;&#153;s northeast was the epicenter of&#13;
Direction of         growth. Semarangâ&#128;&#153;s urban development began in the 17th century, when the colonial&#13;
    Growth           administration (VOC) designated an area of 31 hectares, known as Kota Lama.&#13;
                     Today, Kota Lama Semarang is no longer a growth center. Gradually, social and&#13;
                     economic activity shifted to the cityâ&#128;&#153;s central business district (CBD). Since the&#13;
                     establishment of Tanjung Mas Seaport, activity is particularly concentrated along the&#13;
                     north coast.&#13;

The city has expanded in various directions. New settlements were established in the southern part of the&#13;
city, including Banyumanik and Tembalang.&#13;
To control development, Semarang ensured that measures to reduce risks and manage disasters are&#13;
included in the Spatial Planning (RTRW), specifically through zoning regulations. However, despite the&#13;
presence of disaster risks, the by-law Semarang Spatial Plan for 2011 â&#128;&#147; 2031 has not fully recognized&#13;
potential key hazards such as flooding and landslides.&#13;

              affects the north coast of Semarang, due to high rainfall intensity,        km from the shore to&#13;
              land subsidence, road inundation, and poor drainage systems.                        the mainland&#13;
              Flooding greatly impacts commercial activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Flooding occurs more frequently in the northern part of Semarang and&#13;
              mostly caused by tidal floods and poor drainage systems. Some 91                    91&#13;
              villages are particularly prone to flooding (ACCCRN, 2010; BPBD, 2010;              villages in&#13;
              Fire Department, 2010). The drainage systems are ineffective and carry              Semarang&#13;
              increasing inflow streams during the rainy season. High sedimentation               are prone to&#13;
              in the drainage channels downstream means reduced capacity and                      flood&#13;
              greater vulnerability to floods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Fire hazards occur more frequently in the city center, where economic activity is&#13;
              concentrated.&#13;
&#13;
              The rate of Sea Level Rise in Semarang is about 7.88 mm/year, and reaches 1.7 â&#128;&#147; 3.0&#13;
              km inland. This leads to inundation of some 7,500 to 8,500 hectares and economic&#13;
              losses due to disruption of commercial activities.&#13;
&#13;
              Landslides occur in the south, specifically the eight villages in Gunung Pati subdistrict.&#13;

&amp;#12;Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options. New developments along the&#13;
north coast require countermeasures to sea level rise, such as land elevation and floating&#13;
construction, particularly in new areas for industrial development near Achmad Yani&#13;
Airport and the expansion of Tanjung Mas Seaport.&#13;
Semarang should formulate and implement a risk-based Neighborhood Development&#13;
Planning (RTBL) for industrial and other strategic areas in the north coast and in Central&#13;
Semarang.&#13;
The city must also control groundwater use. Options include improving the supply of tap/&#13;
pipe water, as well as utilizing rainwater harvesting in all sub-districts, particularly in the&#13;
north coast areas.&#13;
Undertake a strategic natural environment review on the RTRW under climate change&#13;
criteria, in order to inform existing and future development investment in the high risk&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
Urban Infrastructure upgrading: As part of Semarangâ&#128;&#153;s flood response program, since&#13;
2010 the West Flood Canal (WFC) has seen improvements through normalization; the&#13;
repairs completed in 2013, and have significantly reduced the impact of flooding in the&#13;
northern and western parts of Semarang.&#13;
The East Flood Canal (EFC), on the other hand, has not been improved, at the time of&#13;
study for this publication in 2013. Coordinating the upgrading and operation of the canal&#13;
system is critical, as they are managed by different river authorities. Development of&#13;
areas in the south -- prone to landslides -- has been rapid.The hills in these areas need to&#13;
be strengthened, by building anchored walls, particularly where the slopes are steep, the&#13;
soil is unstable, and where important infrastructure need safeguarding. The municipality&#13;
should also enforce zoning control and apply stricter rules about the issuance of&#13;
construction permits.&#13;
Urban ecosystem management: To protect activity in the north coast, Semarang must&#13;
revitalize the areaâ&#128;&#153;s mangrove forests. This can reduce the impact of sea level rise, land&#13;
subsidence, and coastal inundation. Similarly, development upstream must be managed,&#13;
particularly settlement development in Banyumanik, Tembalang, and West Semarang.&#13;
Greenery programs, water harvesting, and other efforts to maintain water catchment&#13;
coverage should be integrated with any development that takes place in those areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  49&#13;
&amp;#12;     Flood management remains a major task for Semarang. The existence&#13;
     of West and East Flood Canals is not adequate in tackling the floods,&#13;
     because of the compounding effect of land subsidence along the&#13;
     coast. Semarang needs an integrated drainage system as well as&#13;
     land acquisition schemes for flood-prone areas, so that they can be&#13;
     cleared from built-up activities and repurposed as urban catchment&#13;
     areas and coastal ecosystems.&#13;
     Brisbane is the sister city of Semarang. Flood hazards occur&#13;
     frequently in Brisbane, as the city was built on a river and close to&#13;
     Moreton Bay, with many creeks and tributaries running through the&#13;
     suburbs. During the summer months, severe storms with heavy rainfall&#13;
     are common. These storms can result in flooding from Brisbane&#13;
     River and connected creeks, storm surges along the coastal areas,&#13;
     and overland flow flooding. Brisbane responded by developing an&#13;
     integrated drainage system that covers the whole city. The system is&#13;
     complemented by a backflow prevention device. The device ensures&#13;
     that storm waters will flow only to one direction through a piped&#13;
     storm water system, as well as minimize the amount of water that flow&#13;
     back to the roads/surfaces.&#13;
     This approach can be replicated in Semarang, along the two canals.&#13;
     Development of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s coasts should recognize more water-&#13;
     sensitive land use.&#13;
     For the hilly parts of Semarangâ&#128;&#153;s south, rain harvesting and controlled&#13;
     development are options for reducing flood risks, conserving water,&#13;
     and mitigating land subsidence. Here, the City of Sumida, Tokyo&#13;
     can serve as inspiration. Having high rainfall and situated around two&#13;
     large rivers -- Sumida and Arakawa rivers -- Sumida residents often&#13;
     suffer from flooding but also paradoxically have inadequate water&#13;
     supply. Semarang can adopt Sumidaâ&#128;&#153;s example, by regulating permit&#13;
     requirements for property or residential developers in the Building&#13;
     and Neighborhood Development Plan (RTBL).&#13;
     But the implementation of rainwater utilization also requires the&#13;
     support of municipal government officials, as well as cross-agency&#13;
     cooperation and coordination. Local residents and businesses should&#13;
     also be informed about the short- and long-term benefits of rainwater&#13;
     utilization.&#13;

Pattern and          Yogyakarta as a city dates back to 1755, from the Keraton, with the Royale Palace&#13;
Direction of         Square and fortress as the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main elements. Later, a settlement for abdi dalem&#13;
    Growth           or the royal servants were built in the areas surrounding the Keraton.Traditionally,&#13;
                     Yogyakartans believe in the influence of Mount Merapi in the north and the coastal&#13;
                     area in the south, and hence the development of settlements should follow the same&#13;
                     pattern, in a north-south direction.&#13;

Yogyakarta used to be a relatively small city. In the 1930s, the city had a population of only 60,000 people&#13;
(Baiquni, 2004 in Baier, 2012).. The city has evolved into a metropolitan city, encompassing surrounding&#13;
cities and suburbs. Since the 1970s, migration to the city has grown rapidly. The cityâ&#128;&#153;s population now&#13;
crosses its administrative boundaries, particularly towards Sleman and Bantul districts.&#13;
In recent decades, new centers of commerce, education and tourism have grown in parallel with&#13;
developments of settlements, both formal and informal. As Yogyakarta has limited available land, rapid&#13;
migration into the city has resulted in low-income communities settling in natural disaster hotspots such,&#13;
as vulnerable riverbank slums (Bawole, 2012).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               53&#13;
&amp;#12; Pattern of   Yogyakarta is prone to flooding, flash flooding of cold lava (lahar), landslides, strong&#13;
   Disaster   wind, earthquakes, and fire. Most flooding, lahar, and landslide events are concentrated&#13;
Occurrences   in settlements located along the riverbanks, whereas fire occurs in densely populated&#13;
              areas, particularly in the northern part of the city. Yogyakarta is also at risk from volcanic&#13;
              ash rain, due to its proximity to Mt. Merapi, one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most active volcanoes.&#13;
&#13;
              Lying atop the active Opak fault between Yogyakarta and Bantul District, earthquakes pose&#13;
              a constant threat to Yogyakarta. Earthquakes frequently occur at shallow depths, making&#13;
              many structures very vulnerable. The first recorded earthquake in Yogyakarta Province&#13;
              took place in 1840. Three earthquakes were followed by tsunamis. In 2006, Yogyakarta was&#13;
              struck by a strong earthquake, causing more than 5,000 fatalities. The damage is estimated&#13;
              to exceed USD $ 3.1 billion. According to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology,&#13;
              Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG) and the Center of Volcanology and Geological&#13;
              Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG), the latest and most damaging earthquake occurred on May&#13;
              27, 2006; the quake had a magnitude of only 5.8 â&#128;&#147; 6.2 on the Richter scale (Bappeda,&#13;
              2008). This hightlights the increase exposure of built up assets in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              Most flooding, lahar, and landslide occurrences are concentrated in villages located along&#13;
              the riverbank areas, including Code, Gajahwong, and Winongo River. Due to the expansion&#13;
              of built-up areas and poor drainage systems, the capacity of water catchment areas has&#13;
              declined. Lahar flows primarily through the Code River, a tributary of Mount Merapi.&#13;
              Landslides, on the other hand, strike areas of high development density.&#13;
&#13;
              Fires in Yogyakarta also occur in densely populated areas, with the frequency being 40 to&#13;
              50 times a year.&#13;

&#13;
      Major                                        Increased construction has led to greater density along the Code, Winongo, and&#13;
      Urban                                        Gajahwong rivers. Development takes place despite the fact that the area is geologically&#13;
Investments                                        unstable and prone to landslides. The rivers are also heavily silted by volcanic sediment,&#13;
                                                   reducing their channel capacity and causing frequent overflow. Overcrowding also increases&#13;
                                                   the risk to fire.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;             These three rivers are key urban ecosystems that need careful management to ensure&#13;
             that rapid development will continue to balance between economic growth and&#13;
             ecological wellbeing. Upstream development must be controlled. On-going investments&#13;
             in waste management systems are required in order to control river pollution from&#13;
             commercial and settlement activities along the riverbanks. The Kartamantul inter-&#13;
Resilience&#13;
             administration Joint Secretariat can be beneficial and the city should take advantage&#13;
Options&#13;
             of their presence in order to address more complex disaster regimes beyond their&#13;
             administrative boundaries.&#13;
&#13;
             Risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include accelerating the&#13;
             implementation of effective flooding, lahar, and landslides mitigation along the&#13;
             riverbanks; and restricting the development of hotels, restaurants, and housing along&#13;
             these areas.&#13;
&#13;
             Urban infrastructure upgrading should first formulate a fire mitigation plan, specifically&#13;
             by providing fire hydrants in the most strategic and/or dense areas and improving&#13;
             accessibility for emergency response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Urban ecosystem management focuses on managing Yogyakartaâ&#128;&#153;s watershed, by&#13;
             controlling development from the upstream to the downstream region. Comprehensive&#13;
             waste management is also required to control pollution. The city needs more green and&#13;
             open spaces to preserve the urban microclimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          57&#13;
&amp;#12;     Yogyakarta is a major tourist attraction with a rich&#13;
     cultural heritage, as well as a center for education.&#13;
     There is opportunity here to turn the cityâ&#128;&#153;s three&#13;
     rivers into historic districts with environmental&#13;
     attractions. The City of Kyoto, Japan -- sister city&#13;
     to Yogyakarta -- can be the inspiration. Both cities&#13;
     are rich in cultural heritage, and both are prone&#13;
     to multiple disasters. Kyoto has several rivers&#13;
     and canals, such as the Katsura and Kamogawa&#13;
     (Kamo) rivers; the latter flows through the city and&#13;
     has been designated as cultural heritage. The&#13;
     watershed boundary area is preserved and used&#13;
     by the government as green open space and&#13;
     cyclist lane. It has become one of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;
     tourist attractions.&#13;
     The Kampung development along the Code&#13;
     river serves as a starting point for Yogyakarta,&#13;
     and the community living along the rivers may&#13;
     become the center point of any redevelopment&#13;
     effort. Other rivers such as the Winongo and&#13;
     Gadjahwong rivers can follow suit. One option&#13;
     is to adopt a combination of riverbank natural&#13;
     protection on the upstream segment of the rivers,&#13;
     neighborhood upgrading on the middle segment,&#13;
     and commercial development for tourism small&#13;
     business on the lower segment. The three river&#13;
     corridors can be turned into river walks with nature&#13;
     attractions on the north, traditional kampung walks&#13;
     in the middle, and souvenir arcades in the south&#13;
     near the Palace areas.&#13;
     Riverfront redevelopment can offer both resilience&#13;
     and economic benefit more broadly for the&#13;
     community and the city.&#13;

          Case Study â&#128;&#147; Yogyakarta&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The aim of the Disaster and Climate Risk (DCR) Rapid&#13;
          Diagnostic is to promote evidence-based planning and&#13;
          budgeting practice, by combining technical expertise with&#13;
          community knowledge. Such a diagnostic allows decision&#13;
          makers to identify high risk areas against existing and potential&#13;
          natural hazards; this identification can help local governments&#13;
          initiate disaster preparedness and prevention mechanisms.&#13;
          The risk profile derived from the rapid diagnostic allows&#13;
          municipalities to focus on development corridors that have&#13;
          vulnerable population and assets and can improve the citiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
          overall resilience.&#13;
          This section outlines how the DCR Rapid Diagnostics&#13;
          encourages local government and stakeholders to undertake&#13;
          disaster and climate risk reduction efforts, by integrating&#13;
          resilience into on-going or planned urban investment&#13;
          in Indonesia. A case study was carried out in the City of&#13;
          Yogyakarta, where the Risk Profile produced through the DCR&#13;
          Rapid Diagnostic formed the basis for a pre-feasibility study on&#13;
          redevelopment planning along the Winongo River, identified&#13;
          by the diagnostic as a potential risk. The river redevelopment&#13;
          plan provides a clearer picture on the spatial re-arrangement&#13;
          required along the corridor. The process as presented in the&#13;
          diagram below reflects continued conversation amongst&#13;
          residents about disaster and climate risks and how to build&#13;
          resilience through investments.&#13;

&amp;#12;     The Pre-Feasibility Study outlined, among others, the issues related to different segments of&#13;
     the river, potential themes for redevelopment, and specific potentially transformative priority&#13;
     projects. Along the Winongo River corridor, eight communities have already organized&#13;
     themselves to manage the area. Each community is part of the conceptual development and&#13;
     planning process.&#13;

&amp;#12;As illustration, the central segments of the river have been designated as commercial areas for&#13;
community-based tourism, featuring traditional neighborhoods or â&#128;&#156;kampungâ&#128;&#157; walks. Under such&#13;
plans, basic infrastructure for accessibility must be provided, and attractions as well as landscaping&#13;
further upgraded. Also required in the plan: improvements to existing embankments, construction&#13;
of pedestrian areas with proper drainage and sanitation, and development of commercial strips to&#13;
accommodate community businesses.&#13;
The Winongo Riverwalk Pre-Feasibility Study, carried out by AECOM (2014) and supported by the&#13;
World Bank, estimated between USD 94 to USD 157 million for the costs for resilient redevelopment.&#13;
This investment was estimated to bring economic benefits of between USD 30-70 million annually, or&#13;
USD 200-450 million total, capitalized at 15% over the life of the project. The calculations were based&#13;
primarily on commercial spending from tourists, and do not take into account additional benefits such&#13;
as improved health, economic productivity, flood prevention, increased property value, and improved&#13;
transit and mobility.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         Tourist Streets &amp; Kampung Walks&#13;
                                           Certain streets should be given signage and landscape treatment to allow for these&#13;
                                           connections between the different attractions, the commercial areas and the hotels.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     According to Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s spatial planning regulations, each city is required to develop a detailed spatial&#13;
     plan at the scale of 1:5,000, including in areas with high population density such as the Winongo river&#13;
     zone. The detailed spatial plans typically outline designations of land use or zoning regulations, which&#13;
     broadly include settlement (low and high density), green open space, and river buffer zone, commercial&#13;
     areas, etc. Under the existing planning hierarchy, exceptions to the general zoning (e.g., using part green&#13;
     open space to accommodate settlements) can only be done through the development of Building and&#13;
     Neighborhood Development Plans, also known as the RTBL (Rencana Tata Bangunan dan Lingkungan).&#13;
     The RTBL provides an opportunity to codify existing spatial solutions needed for redevelopment into the&#13;
     formal spatial plan. It requires high resolution maps at scales of up to 1:2,000.&#13;
     Once a target area is identified and options for resilience selected, collaborative geospatial investigation&#13;
     is carried out by local technical agencies and community, in order to identify areas where adjustment&#13;
     and/or exception to the existing spatial plan is required to reduce the vulnerability. This exercise is called&#13;
     Collaborative Hazard Microzoning delineation.&#13;

and environment revitalization that will help increase resiliency. This multi-discipline&#13;
analysis, involving a diverse group of experts from economists, environmentalists,&#13;
hydrologists, community development specialists, legal advocates as well as community&#13;
representatives. With the help of experts and planners, the community and the government&#13;
can manifest their vision of riverwalk redevelopment.&#13;

     Previous urban upgrading investments made along the Winongo river have provided concrete examples&#13;
     of how redevelopment on riverbank areas can increase resilience to flood and landslide risks. Figure 12&#13;
     A and B provide illustrative examples of the upgrading projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;   The Winongo River case study in Yogyakarta demonstrates the&#13;
   case for investing in resilience, and that it can be initiated within&#13;
   the cityâ&#128;&#153;s existing development programs, as well as other relevant&#13;
   government investments in municipalities. The Disaster and&#13;
   Climate Risk Rapid Diagnostic has helped cities identify risks&#13;
   and select development corridors where resilient investments&#13;
   can be implemented, without necessarily creating Disaster Risk&#13;
   Management specific projects such as flood protection programs.&#13;
   Many resilience-building investments can be integrated within&#13;
   urban redevelopment spaces, such as along densely populated&#13;
   river corridors. For example, segment number 1 out of the 8&#13;
   segments within the Winongo River has been selected as a pilot&#13;
   site for the Ministry of Public Works and Housingâ&#128;&#153;s National&#13;
   Slum Upgrading Program. The community-based Winongo&#13;
   Redevelopment Plan enables the city to implement investment&#13;
   plans for the designated segment. For fiscal year 2015, an&#13;
   estimated of IDR 10 billion has been allocated for Slum Upgrading&#13;
   Investment, which will improve access to basic service delivery,&#13;
   promote positive externalities of lower-income households,&#13;
   generate local income and reduce the areaâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to&#13;
   disasters risk and climate change. The Rapid Risk Diagnostic has&#13;
   provided the impetus for the city government and stakeholders&#13;
   to embark on conversation on disaster risks â&#128;&#147; and this has led to&#13;
   concrete investments towards urban resilience.&#13;

&amp;#12;The Book was developed based on the experiences of conducting disaster&#13;
and climate risk rapid diagnostic in the cities of Balikpapan, Denpasar,&#13;
Makassar, Palembang, Semarang and Yogyakarta in Indonesia around&#13;
2013. The rapid diagnostic produced city risk profiles which were used&#13;
as dialogue and conversation tool by the city government and their&#13;
stakeholders on addressing their most significant risk through resilient&#13;
urban investment.&#13;
&#13;
The Book summarizes the risk profile and resilience options in each city as&#13;
well as provide illustrative example of concrete resilient urban investment,&#13;
primarily through risk sensitive land use zoning, urban upgrading, and&#13;
ecosystem management/rehabilitation using Yogyakarta as case example.&#13;
It also serves as practical implementation in Indonesia of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 2012, the World Bank initiated the
            building urban resilience in East Asia program, aimed at
            increasing the resilience of cities to disasters and the
            impact of climate change by using a risk-based approach to
            making public investment decisions. The objective is to
            demonstrate a scalable methodology and practical tools for
            risk assessment that can be used for city-level investment
            decisions. This activity started with engaging selected
            cities that have reasonable complexity and are experiencing
            significant growth. The next step involved conversations
            about disaster and climate risks confronting the cities and
            the options that they can consider in building resilience.
            The result of this experiment is presented in this report.
            The book begins with two chapters on the disaster and
            climate vulnerabilities in the context of Indonesian cities,
            and the basic framework developed by the World Bank building
            urban resilience in East Asia program. The subsequent two
            chapters describe the rapid risk diagnostic as the first
            step in the urban resilience engagement, and the summary of
            the diagnostic findings in selected Indonesian cities. The
            final chapter provides a glimpse of how options to invest in
            resilience can be materialized in practice as part of a
            city’s development.
