ARMENIA&#13;
HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
1. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economic Overview&#13;
1.1          Armenia is a small (29,800 sq km), mountainous, landlocked country with a population&#13;
of 3.65 million. GDP per capita was estimated at $670 in 1994. With few natural resources and only&#13;
15 percent of the land able to be farmed, Armenians have survived through strong traditions of education&#13;
and entrepreneurship. Armenia formally declared independence on September 23, 1991 and elected a&#13;
reform minded government the following month. The government has proceeded to implement far&#13;
reaching reforms including the removal of restrictions on external trade, the privatization of agricultural&#13;
land and industrial enterprises, and serious attempts to control monetary and fiscal expansion. Since&#13;
Armenia had a large but uneconomic industrial base within the Former Soviet Union (FSU) that depended&#13;
in large part upon imports and exports to the other parts of the FSU, the dissolution of the FSU and the&#13;
blockades by two of Armenia's neighbors related to the hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh have had a&#13;
devastating effect on the economy. GDP fell by 52 percent in 1992 to about one-third of its 1989 level,&#13;
and a further 15 percent in 1993. The decline leveled off in 1994, with a real GDP growth of 5.4&#13;
percent according to government estimates.&#13;
1.2          The Government succeeded in reducing inflation from 46 percent per month in the first&#13;
quarter of 1994 to 2 percent per month in the first quarter of 1995. This was accomplished through a&#13;
stabilization program undertaken from the Spring of 1994, with IMF advice. Financial assistance from&#13;
the IMF commenced in December 1994 with the approval of a Systemic Transformation Facility. These&#13;
gains have been consolidated through the support of a Standby Arrangement with the IMF that was&#13;
concluded in June 1995. In parallel the Government is undertaking a comprehensive structural reform&#13;
program supported by a Rehabilitation Credit from IDA approved in February 1995. It will now be&#13;
critically important to stimulate output in a stable economic environment that will attract long term&#13;
sustainable investment as a means of raising living standards and relieving the severe shortages affecting&#13;
the entire economy. A functioning road network is a vital precondition for achieving this strategy.&#13;
B. Overview of the Transport Sector&#13;
1.3          The Government inherited one segment of the FSU road system, a minuscule part of the&#13;
massive FSU railway network, and one segment of the FSU air transport system, along with the&#13;
responsibility for transport infrastructure and rolling stock. The entire system, including the maintenance&#13;
and repair facilities, were in need of substantial overhaul and repair.&#13;
1.4          The railway system consists of an electrified main track of 825 km, two short branch lines&#13;
to Gumri and Lake Sevan, and two international links to the north and one to the south. There is also&#13;
an out-of-gauge connection with Turkish railways at Ahurian. The rolling stock consists of 100 diesel&#13;
and electric locomotives, many that are 20-25 years old, and 80 diesel locomotives for shunting. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                               Economic Background and the Transport Sector&#13;
are road/rail container terminals operated by Armenian Railways (AR) at Yerevan, Gumri, and Kirivakan,&#13;
and a rail/rail terminal at Ahurian. As spare parts are increasingly difficult to obtain, the locomotive fleet&#13;
is now being cannibalized.&#13;
1.5          For air transport, Armenia acquired a collection of old and fuel-inefficient aircraft from&#13;
the Aeroflot fleet, two major airports and six minor airports and strips.  Armenia still shares&#13;
arrangements with Aeroflot for fleet maintenance, reciprocal rights, and allocation of costs and revenues.&#13;
The air freight business has already been turned over to a joint venture with a private company, while&#13;
Armenia Airlines runs normal CIS passenger flights and international charters in collaboration with&#13;
foreign agencies. The new terminal facilities at the Yerevan airport should be adequate, but the handling&#13;
of both passengers and cargo is disorganized.&#13;
1.6          The Armenia national road network is adequate for the present level of traffic.&#13;
Maintenance of the national network is carried out under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications (MTC), and an additional number of smaller roads are maintained by local and regional&#13;
authorities. At the time of independence, the vehicle fleet included around 100,000 vehicles owned by&#13;
Ministries and public enterprises. The average age of the fleet was over 7 years and the daily availability&#13;
was only about 70 percent due to lack of maintenance. The MTC had 102 garages and workshops for&#13;
carrying out repairs.  Some of the workshops have been privatized and the balance are run on&#13;
independent profit-making lines. It is the Government's policy to privatize as many of these activities&#13;
as possible during the next several years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                   3&#13;
11. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. The Highway Network&#13;
2.1          Public Roads. The total road network in Armenia is just under 7,800 km (see Table 2.1),&#13;
of which 77 percent are paved. The road network is divided into Interstate Highways (1,440 km),&#13;
Regional Roads (2,621 km) and District Roads (3,727 km). The Interstate Highways include 60 km of&#13;
four lane highways serving the highest density routes. The system includes 829 bridges, 13 of which are&#13;
wooden. The mountainous terrain of Armenia determines where people can live, and in general also the&#13;
need for location of the road networks. The existing road network with a density of 0.26 km per sq km&#13;
is adequate for the traffic needs at this time.&#13;

District         2,247        65.1        1,300         34.9              3,727&#13;
TOTAL            6,030        77.4        1,758         22.6              7,788&#13;
2.2          Traffic. Traffic levels are very much lower than they were in the 1970s. This reflects&#13;
the critical economic situation of the past few years when the size of the Armenian economy declined by&#13;
more than 50 percent. Traffic counts on the Interstate road network were carried out in 1994 by&#13;
TecnEcon (see para. 2.4), finding that nearly 83 percent of the network carries less than 3,000 vehicles&#13;
per day. Heaviest traffic is concentrated on the dual highways radiating outward from Yerevan.&#13;
Passenger car traffic accounts for around 75 percent of total vehicle kilometers, while heavy trucks of&#13;
three or more axles make up only 8 percent of the total. Traffic will undoubtedly increase as the&#13;
economy recovers from its seriously depressed present level, although no patterns have been established&#13;
that can form the basis of an estimate of future growth. Other uncertainties relate to the future of the&#13;
railway system, which is in need of massive investment to restore it to good condition and whose viability&#13;
will affect road traffic patterns, and the closed borders with two of Armenia's neighbors, where their&#13;
opening would also change the rate of use on several important routes.&#13;
2.3          Climate and terrain. Extensive areas of the highway network cross mountainous terrain&#13;
and altitudes often exceed 1500 meters. Steep gradients, deep cuttings and high embankments are&#13;
common in these areas, and landslides occur frequently. The severe winter climate, especially in the&#13;
more mountainous areas of the country where heavy snowfalls are common, require substantial efforts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                                    The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
to maintain access. In many areas of the network, high intensity rainfall and poor road drainage cause&#13;
traffic problems and road damage. The extreme climate has an influence on the behavior of road&#13;
pavements, particularly as a result of the action of freezing and thawing in the spring.&#13;
2.4           Road conditions. The road conditions were surveyed in July 1994 by a consultant&#13;
(TecnEcon) financed by EU-TACIS, and assisted by the Armenian Road Directorate (ARD). The result&#13;
of the survey is summarized as follows:&#13;
8.3 percent        Visible defects of less than 5% of surface. No structural failures;&#13;
54.7 percent       Defects over less than 30% of surface. In general structure is still sound,&#13;
but localized reconstruction of top pavement layer required;&#13;
27.3 percent       Defects over at least one third of pavement area with some signs of early&#13;
structural failure. Critical condition, but appropriate pavement seal will&#13;
save structure;&#13;
5.0 percent        Extensive evidence of significant structural failure. Extensive repairs to&#13;
prevent complete failure;&#13;
4.7 percent        Pavements have failed. Complete reconstruction required.&#13;
The cost of the rehabilitation of this portion of the road network, as calculated by the consultant and&#13;
modified somewhat when reviewed by IDA, is US$20.3 million (see Annex B). A visible inspection of&#13;
a portion of the main road network in 1995 revealed that serious additional deterioration had occurred&#13;
since the EU-TACIS-financed survey. It is apparent that the road pavements are now deteriorating at an&#13;
accelerating rate, a trend that can be expected to continue until the road maintenance activities match the&#13;
rate of deterioration. Based on an extrapolation of this study, the total cost of the deferred maintenance&#13;
for the entire road network is in excess of US$100 million.&#13;
2.5    Budget constraints starting in 1990 and accelerating through 1994 required ARD to reduce its&#13;
pavement maintenance operations drastically. In 1994, the total road maintenance budget was only&#13;
equivalent to US$2.4 million, and ARD had only received 20 percent of this amount by the end of the&#13;
calendar year. This amount, less than one percent of the 1990 road maintenance budget, was not enough&#13;
even to carry out the routine maintenance operations for the national road network such as the filling of&#13;
potholes.&#13;
B. Road Safety&#13;
2.6           The road safety situation in Armenia is very poor by international standards.  The&#13;
statistics show that the number of accidents and fatalities have declined during the past several years but&#13;
this is due to the sharply declining traffic volumes and poor accident reporting. While no reliable figures&#13;
exist for the number of vehicles in the country, a comparison of fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants in 1990,&#13;
when traffic was at a more normal level, with 17 other countries with vehicle densities in the same&#13;
general order of magnitude (100 vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants) such as Bolivia, Egypt, and the&#13;
Philippines shows that the Armenian level of fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants was higher than all but two&#13;
of these countries in 1990 before traffic levels declined.&#13;
&#13;

2.7           Responsibility for road safety is shared by the MTC, ARD and the Traffic Police. While&#13;
there is some overlapping of responsibilities, generally they are as follows:&#13;
-      MTC, through its Office of Road Safety and Line Control Administration, is&#13;
responsible for inspecting the adequacy of road signs and markings, investigating&#13;
road accidents, training of drivers for Government-operated vehicles, the&#13;
condition of Government-owned vehicles, and the overall coordination of road&#13;
safety.&#13;
ARD, through its Road Utilization Office, is responsible for assuring that safety&#13;
considerations are included in the design of new roads and that the safety designs&#13;
are installed, assessing the need for road signs and markings, and keeping&#13;
records on the most dangerous road sections.&#13;
The Traffic Police are responsible for vehicle registration, driver training, testing&#13;
and licensing, recording and analyzing road accidents, preventing any violations&#13;
of the traffic regulations, and controlling the safety aspects of the installation of&#13;
road works.&#13;
2.8          In practice, these responsibilities have not been effectively carried out in recent years&#13;
because of the shortage of budget resources, which has resulted in inadequate facilities to carry out the&#13;
work. Road markings and signs have not been maintained, both because of budget constraints and&#13;
because the sign posts are frequently removed to use as building materials in a country where there is a&#13;
shortage of everything. There has been very little if any active cooperation between the Traffic Police&#13;
and ARD, and accidents have been recorded but not analyzed as to cause.&#13;
2.9           IDA has assisted the Government to secure a grant from The Netherlands for the&#13;
preparation of a Road Safety Plan aimed at the improvement of road safety conditions in the country.&#13;
The grant will fund consultant services to carry out the following tasks:&#13;
(a)    undertake a Road Safety Survey recording the present situation and identifying&#13;
existing strengths and weaknesses;&#13;
(b)    in close cooperation with the bodies responsible for Road Safety in Armenia,&#13;
assist in developing a comprehensive Road Safety Plan. TIe Plan will identify&#13;
priority actions needed to improve the institutional aspects, and priority road&#13;
safety activities to be undertaken during the next four years. The Plan will&#13;

cover:&#13;
(i)  organizations, management and policy development;&#13;
(ii)  review of laws and regulation (traffic, vehicle, penalty, police/court&#13;
procedures);&#13;
(iii) law  enforcement improvements  (surveillance  methods, equipment,&#13;
procedures, training);&#13;
(iv) review of driver training and licensing road safety education in schools and&#13;
improvement of public awareness through public media and campaigns;&#13;
(v)  review of accident reporting system, data collection and accident analysis;&#13;
(vi) address the road safety issues related to road infrastructure and traffic&#13;
management;&#13;
(vii) review the vehicle inspection system;&#13;
(viii) improvements of assistance to road accident victims;&#13;
(ix) establish suitable financing mechanisms for the Road Safety organization&#13;
and its activities.&#13;
(c)    assist in developing and implementing priority institutional items identified in the&#13;
Road Safety Plan;&#13;
(d)    assist to arrange a National Road Safety Conference to launch the Road Safety&#13;
Plan and to raise awareness within the Government and the public;&#13;
(e)    assist in starting up priority road safety activities pilot schemes as identified in&#13;
the Road Safety Plan;&#13;
(f)    arrange visits by local stakeholders to institutions in countries with well&#13;
developed Road Safety Programs.&#13;
The Road Safety Plan prepared with the assistance of this grant would become the basis for road safety&#13;
activities to be carried out with the assistance of grant funds to be secured from other sources during the&#13;
life of the project.&#13;
C. Highway Organization&#13;
2.10          ARD, which operates as a semi-independent public agency under the authority of the&#13;
MTC, has the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national road network. ARD&#13;
has used the Armgiprodor Institute in Yerevan, another public body now functioning like a private&#13;
organization, for the design of new roads, reconstruction and rehabilitation schemes, and for identification&#13;
of maintenance activities. The Institute is also responsible for carrying out highway surveys and checking&#13;
materials and workmanship.  Another public organization, the Armgiprotrans Institute, has been&#13;
responsible for the design of bridges and tunnels as well as several major highways. ARD also uses its&#13;
own highway inspectors for quality control and cost assessments. Road construction and maintenance&#13;
have been carried out by 37 state-owned District Enterprises and seven specialized construction&#13;
enterprises that operate under the direction of ARD, although the construction companies have recently&#13;
been merged into some of the District Enterprises.&#13;
&#13;

The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                  7&#13;
2.11         Each District Enterprise has an equipment pool and is responsible for the maintenance&#13;
of its own equipment, although not all of the Enterprises have their own storage and equipment repair&#13;
facilities. The result is considerable duplication of equipment and extensive over-staffing. The District&#13;
Enterprises have in the past made their own decisions as to priorities for periodic maintenance operations&#13;
within the limits of the budget allocation channeled through the MTC and ARD.&#13;

8                                                                 The Highway Sub-Sector&#13;
difficulties in obtaining spare parts for any items manufactured outside of Armenia.&#13;
2.13         Personnel. The total current employment level in ARD-related operations was estimated&#13;
by ARD to be 4,280 people in 1994. This is a reduction from about 10,000 people employed three years&#13;
ago. The District Enterprises employ about 3,800 people (89 percent of the total number of employees),&#13;
the central ARD office has 68 employees, and the rest are employed by the Institutes.&#13;
2.14         ARD personnel appear to be competently trained in engineering skills. However, the&#13;
engineering staff has been isolated from the advances in road techniques developed in the Western&#13;
economies over the last few decades. Also, there is a general lack of awareness by ARD's staff of the&#13;
techniques for using cost analysis as a basis for making choices regarding pavement management&#13;
strategies, materials and equipment, as well as knowledge about contracting and procurement procedures.&#13;
D. Privatization&#13;
2.15         Under the Government's general policy of privatization, the Armgiprodor Institute has&#13;
been partially privatized. The employees rent the company's facilities from the Government, and income&#13;
is limited to the contracts that the Institute can obtain on a paying basis from clients, most of whom are&#13;
Government agencies such as ARD. Also, private engineering firms have begun to emerge, and a few&#13;
are capable of providing services to ARD for road design and supervision. The Government has&#13;
announced that it intends to continue to privatize substantial portions of the economy, and the 37 District&#13;
Enterprises have been put on the Government's 1995 privatization list. Privatization will be carried out&#13;
under the Privatization Act of 1992, under which the privatization process is being regulated. The first&#13;
step in the process is to issue certificates of entitlement to shares of 20 percent of the value of the&#13;
enterprise to the employees based on longevity and position within the firm. These certificates are to be&#13;
converted into shares at no cost to the employees at the time the privatization takes place, which occurs&#13;
when the Privatization Commission has placed a value on the stock and put the remaining 80 percent up&#13;
for sale. In the interim while waiting for the privatization to take place, each enterprise will be placed&#13;
under a Managing Council, with 40 percent of the members elected by the employee certificate holders&#13;
and 60 percent appointed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The Council will elect a&#13;
President and will appoint an Executive Director to manage the enterprise, which will begin to function&#13;
like a private company even before its legal status is changed. After the stock sale takes place, the&#13;
enterprise becomes a fully private stock company, owned and controlled by its stockholders.&#13;
2.16         During the interim period, the Government is not expected to subsidize the partially&#13;
privatized entities. The ability of the privatized enterprises to survive will depend on how quickly and&#13;
well they acquire new skills in business management, cost accounting and control, bidding and&#13;
contracting, and quality control. For ARD, this will mean that its staff will have to acquire new skills&#13;
in contract management, including contracting procedures and quantity and quality control, since all civil&#13;
works functions irncluding routine and winter maintenance will be carried out on a contract basis.&#13;
E. Highway Planning and Expenditures&#13;
2.17         Planning and Expenditure Procedures. Before independence, the highway authority&#13;
organization obtained its budget from Moscow, which was agreed between the GOSPLAN in Moscow&#13;
and the Armenian Government. Traditionally 20 year road development programs were prepared and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                  9&#13;
updated every five years. Since independence, budgets are requested through the MTC to the Ministry&#13;
of Finance and passed on to the ARD.&#13;
2.18         A characteristic of the Armenian highway maintenance program is related to the weather&#13;
conditions. The construction season during which bitumen products can be applied for surface dressings&#13;
and overlays is generally limited to the May through October period because of the climate. Somewhat&#13;
balancing the summer workload, the winter season requires snow clearing and sand/salt spreading to keep&#13;
the roads safe and open to traffic. However, the unpredictability of the winter conditions makes the&#13;
planning and budgeting during the winter season difficult.&#13;
2.19         Budget Levels. The ARD's budget and its conversion into constant 1992 prices, as&#13;
calculated by ARD, is:&#13;
Table 2.4: ARD Annual Budget (Rubles million)&#13;
1988        1989         1990         1991        1992         1993&#13;
Current     105.7        113.8        129.4       191.1        718.3        4946.8&#13;

prices    I _ _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _I_ _    _ _ _ _   I__  __ _&#13;
Thus inflation has caused a reduction in ARD's budget for 1993 when measured in constant prices to&#13;
about 12 percent of the 1988 level. The 1994 level was further reduced to about I million drams,&#13;
equivalent to about US$2.4 million, which is about 3 percent of the 1988 level. Only about 20 percent&#13;
of this amount was actually made available to ARD in 1994, although the balance of the 1994 budget was&#13;
paid to ARD in early 1995. Some of the decrease in budget resources was absorbed by a reduction in&#13;
real average wages, and some work was carried out by borrowing funds or supplies from local authorities&#13;
interested in keeping the roads open. At present, the average monthly pay for ARD employees is&#13;
exceptionally low, as it is for all Government employees, averaging no more than the equivalent of&#13;
US$4.40 for administrative staff and US$3.60 for the other staff. The budget level for ARD for 1995&#13;
has been increased to the equivalent to US$3.8 million, which is an improvement over the 1994 level but&#13;
still inadequate for maintaining the national road network.&#13;
2.20         The budget allocations for new roads, capital expenditure/reconstruction, periodic and&#13;
routine maintenance were as follows:&#13;

F. Road User Charges&#13;
2.21          During the Soviet era, funds were collected from enterprises, collective farms and trade&#13;
organizations by a form of business turnover tax devoted to upkeep of the road network. These taxes&#13;
are no longer collected due to the low level of business activity, and so there are virtually no road user&#13;
charges in effect in Armenia at this time. Several months ago, however, as part of a package of measures&#13;
worked out with the IMF, the Government put forward to the Parliament a proposal for a vehicle&#13;
registration fee to be charged for all vehicles at a rate equivalent to about US$7 per vehicle, which has&#13;
now been put into effect. Also, an import duty was proposed at a rate of 10 percent for all fuel imports&#13;
from non-CIS countries (the Government stated that it could not impose an import duty on CIS goods&#13;
because of a reciprocal agreement with the CIS countries). These proposals are still under consideration&#13;
by the Parliament. It is not possible to estimate accurately what collections will be generated by these&#13;
taxes since there are no reliable statistics on imports of fuel from non-CIS countries. However, it is&#13;
unlikely that the total of both taxes and fees will exceed the equivalent of US$2 million per year in 1995&#13;
even if approved by the Parliament and if fully collected.&#13;
2.22          During project preparation, Government agreed on the need to increase road user charges.&#13;
It is now putting into effect a revised schedule of road user charges to be used for the maintenance of&#13;
national and local roads. Collections are expected to begin in 1995. The principal source of revenue will&#13;
be a charge on the total revenue of all enterprises at the rate of 0.4 percent except for transportation&#13;
companies, where the tax will be 2.0 percent. Estimated income from this source is estimated to be on&#13;
the order of US$5 million in 1995, rising to higher levels in future years as the economy improves.&#13;
2.23          The Government is also carrying out a study of additional road user taxes and charges&#13;
to augment or replace the enterprise tax, including the following:&#13;
-Fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel for vehicles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                   11&#13;
-Transit tax&#13;
-Axle load tax on large trucks&#13;
-Tax on the procurement of buses and trucks.&#13;
The level of the taxes has not yet been fixed, and the collection mechanisms present some problems that&#13;
require careful study. One such problem is that fuel in Armenia is imported in small quantities on trucks&#13;
and sold in 20 liter jerrycans at temporary sites alongside the road. This makes tax collection difficult,&#13;
especially since the authorities would like to tax road users of diesel without taxing the use of diesel&#13;
for other purposes such as for generators or farm machinery. The study will consider solutions to these&#13;
problems and is expected to provide a basis for Government decision and action when it is completed.&#13;
2.24          In the longer run, the Government will need to make provision to collect a sufficient level&#13;
of revenues from road users to finance an adequate level of road maintenance for the national road&#13;
network. That level is difficult to calculate under present unstable economic conditions, but is on the&#13;
order of US$25 million (the maintenance budget under the old system was around US$60 million, a level&#13;
that was probably excessive). An amount of this size is beyond Armenia's present ability to raise, given&#13;
the present state of the economy (total Government revenues in 1995 from all sources for all purposes&#13;
is now estimated to be about US$180 million). However, the increase in revenues will have to be phased&#13;
in gradually as the economy recovers in order to avoid aborting the recovery. Also, the institutional and&#13;
technical improvements for highway maintenance included in the project are expected to yield savings&#13;
in the cost of maintenance, but some operating experience with the new procedures will be needed in&#13;
order to make an accurate estimate of the level of funding required for future maintenance operations.&#13;

2.25          Road classification and design standards. The Armenian roads are classified into five&#13;
categories defined on the basis of traffic volume only. The design standards are based on those used by&#13;
the former Soviet Union. The geometric standards of the existing roads are generally adequate except&#13;
in difficult mountainous terrain where hairpin bends and other reduced standards are common. The road&#13;
carriageway and shoulder design width are often too wide for the present traffic needs. The original&#13;
pavement design was adequate, and in most cases the bearing capacity of correctly constructed roads will&#13;
suffice subject to axle-loads being controlled and pavements maintained. However, with an expected&#13;
increase of heavy load traffic on some international routes, pavement strengthening will be required, and&#13;
drains, which are often substandard, will need upgrading.&#13;
2.26          Condition survey. Regular visual highway inspections were carried out on parts of the&#13;
network in the spring and autumn of each year, but the survey and reporting system was poor.&#13;
Roughness surveys have also been carried out over a part of the network every year, but the equipment&#13;
used has not been calibrated to any standards. The equipment used for these surveys is described more&#13;
fully below.&#13;
2.27          Axle load information. Although the pavements of the most recently constructed main&#13;
roads are designed to the Soviet GOST design standards based on 10 tons standard design axle load, most&#13;
roads are constructed for 6 ton axle load only. Presently the legal single axle load limit is 10 tons, but&#13;
no information is collected on actual axle loads. ARD is aware, however, that loads of scrap metal and&#13;
bulk goods considerably heavier than this limit are being hauled on the highways, causing serious wear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                                 The Highway Sub-Sectr&#13;
and deterioration to the pavements.&#13;
2.28         Highway database, The Armgiprodor Institute in Yerevan has commenced development&#13;
of a highway database. It contains detailed construction data, including road curvature and elevation,&#13;
camber cuttings and embankments, and details of structures such as retaining walls and culverts. Some&#13;
information on roughness and skid resistance is stored, but nothing is yet available on pavement strength,&#13;
pavement layer thickness, cracking, rutting or any other defect types. No traffic data is recorded. Up-&#13;
to-date accident data is available, but not sufficiently complete to satisfy the need for accident analysis&#13;
and is not recorded in the road database. The database is being developed on the principle of providing&#13;
maximum detail from the beginning so that only a small part of the network is covered. From a&#13;
maintenance and pavement management point of view it would have been more useful to have started with&#13;
less detailed data covering the whole main road network and then adding the detail as and when available.&#13;
Most crucially, no network wide data referencing system has been established and inventory and condition&#13;
data are intermixed and usually stored in terms of averages and general descriptions.&#13;
2.29         Highway inventory. A file ("passport") is kept for each route in which details about the&#13;
route are stored. These are maintained manually on paper, and are not up-to-date. The file contains road&#13;
section lengths, the location of highway structures along the route and sometimes when highway&#13;
maintenance was carried out. Much information is duplicated, but there is no information on road signs,&#13;
road markings, guardrails, speed limits, or details of pavement construction. Unfortunately the road file&#13;
information is of limited value for maintenance planning.&#13;
2.30         Highway survey equipment. The Armgiprodor Institute has several items of Russian&#13;
made highway survey equipment, including: a falling weight deflectometer (FWD); two towed bump&#13;
integrators; a towed skid resistance wheel; and two Russian-made survey buses with on-board equipment&#13;
for measuring horizontal and vertical alignment, rutting and distances. The FWD equipment and one of&#13;
the survey buses have never been used because they were delivered incomplete and lack the software and&#13;
user instructions required to run the equipment. The skid resistance wheel has inherent deficiencies in&#13;
the way it is operated, and its results are unlikely to be reliable. One of the bump integrators is working,&#13;
but it is not in good condition.&#13;
2.31         Laboratory testing facilities. The Armgiprodor Institute has laboratory testing facilities&#13;
with a limited amount of equipment for testing cement, concrete, aggregate, soil and rudimentary bitumen&#13;
samples. The equipment available for these purposes includes presses, bitumen penetrometers and&#13;
viscosity measuring, cube making and other common devices. All the equipment is said to work.&#13;
2.32         Materials. Bitumen for road construction and maintenance came in the past entirely from&#13;
Russia, and the quality varied. Because of import difficulties from Russia, recently some bitumen has&#13;
been imported from Iran. Armenia has granite rock suitable for stone aggregate production in a few&#13;
places only, but has a substantial supply of basalt of marginal quality.&#13;
2.33         The combination of woefully inadequate financial resources, physical difficulties to import&#13;
because of the blockade by Turkey and Azerbaijan, and substantial price increases have caused&#13;
considerable shortage of essential highway maintenance supplies. The 1993 bitumen consumption was&#13;
only 15 percent of the 1991 quantity, there is a continuous shortage of fuel, ARD's spare parts stores are&#13;
empty, and much equipment is being cannibalized to keep the most necessary units running.&#13;
2.34         Construction quality. Almost all of the road network was constructed during the FSU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Highway Sub-Sector                                                                   13&#13;
period to a generally adequate design standard, followed by a period of generous maintenance. However,&#13;
poor quality control and poor workmanship have offset these advantages. In particular poor drainage&#13;
provisions, poor compaction, poor control of vertical finish, incorrect grading of aggregate, use of&#13;
unsuitable types of bitumen for surface dressing, and uneven bitumen distribution have resulted in a road&#13;
network with many problematic areas where reconstruction/strengthening is now required.&#13;
2.35          Although little maintenance has been carried out since 1991 in Armenia, some stretches&#13;
of the network have received surface dressing and pothole repairs. However, the quality of these&#13;
treatments has generally been poor. Patched potholes are not cut out cleanly or properly filled and&#13;
compacted. Consequently, they do not stop further deterioration, and treatment is often required at the&#13;
same place within a year or two. Although greater care appears to be taken when surface dressing is&#13;
carried out, substantial damage to the treated pavement occurs because the road is opened to traffic&#13;
immediately after the treatment has been applied, with no speed restrictions in force. As a result,&#13;
significant stripping occurs, and poor control of the quantities of bitumen applied to the road surface&#13;
results in extensive areas of bleeding.&#13;
H. Environmental Procedures and Issues&#13;
2.36          Until recently, environmental considerations were given only marginal consideration. The&#13;
Armgiprodor Institute provided limited consultant services to determine pollutant counts from alternative&#13;
materials relative to asphalt production, but has had no experience with the application of either&#13;
mechanical or electrical filters for effluents. After serious environmental problems with their chemical&#13;
industry, Lake Sevan and a debate about reopening of the nuclear power station, the public is now more&#13;
environmentally aware than in the past. In 1991 the Ministry of Nature and Environment (MNEP) was&#13;
established with responsibility for making policy and promulgating standards relevant to environmental&#13;
protection. Regulatory and licensing systems were put in place that require the consideration of&#13;
environmental issues in the design and implementation of development projects. The MNEP must sign&#13;
off on all designs for road works, and MNEP-issued licenses are required for the operation of all&#13;
quarries. Also, the MNEP is in the process of preparing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP),&#13;
which will be ready by June 30, 1997, as well as reviewing a variety of policies and regulatory standards.&#13;
In addition, the State Engineering University now offers a Masters degree course in Environmental&#13;
Engineering. In general, the measures already in place and under preparation appear to be adequate to&#13;
safeguard the environment in connection with road work.&#13;

14                                                      The Bank's Experience and Strategy&#13;
111. THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Bank/I]DA Lending to Armenia&#13;
3.1          Armenia joined the World Bank in June 1992. In March 1993 an Institution Building&#13;
Loan (Ln. No. 3585-AM) was approved, directed to providing institutional support to government&#13;
institutions that are critical to the restructuring of Armenia's economy. This was followed by an&#13;
Earthquake Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. No. 2562-AM) for the reconstruction of houses and industry&#13;
buildings in the area most severely affected by the 1988 earthquake. Also, a Power Maintenance Credit&#13;
(Cr. No. 2666-AM) to strengthen the energy sector and an Irrigation Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. No. 2667-&#13;
AM) were approved on December 8, 1994 and a Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. No. 2683-AM), designed to&#13;
support the Govermnent's reform program through the provision of foreign exchange to finance critically&#13;
needed imports, was approved on February 28, 1995.&#13;
B. Country Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.2          The key objectives of the Bank's country assistance strategy for Armenia as outlined in&#13;
the Rehabilitation Credit are to deepen structural reforms to complete the transition to a market economy&#13;
and to alleviate the large pockets of poverty that have emerged over the last few years. In terms of&#13;
structural reforms, emphasis is being placed on promoting private sector development and establishing&#13;
a targeted system of social protection. Sector specific interventions to complement the economy-wide&#13;
efforts will focus on the delivery of social services, on energy efriciency and on the rehabilitation of&#13;
critical infrastructure. While overall transport infrastructure is generally considered adequate to meet the&#13;
short term requirements of the economy, there is an urgent need to prevent the further deterioration of&#13;
the road network, particularly for those routes that connect Armenia to its sources of essential imports&#13;
and to its export markets. In the longer run, there is a need to improve the efficiency and adequacy of&#13;
road maintenance operations, and to build an effective maintenance organization that can develop a road&#13;
network that is adequate to meet the needs of the expected expansion of road traffic as the economy&#13;
expands.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects in the Highway Subsector&#13;
3.3          The proposed project will be the first Bank/IDA highway project for Armenia. However,&#13;
the Bank has had considerable experience in financing highway projects in other parts of the world,&#13;
including Eastern Europe. Much of the Bank's lending for highway operations was for road construction&#13;
up to about 1980. However, the road building boom of the 1960s and 1970s created an infrastructure&#13;
that began to deteriorate rapidly in the late 1970s. Road networks had expanded much faster than the&#13;
corresponding maintenance budgets and institutional capacities. Traffic was also increasing at a higher&#13;
than projected rate, and axle loads often exceeded the design capacity of pavements. The serious&#13;
magnitude of the problem was demonstrated in a policy study undertaken by the World Bank in 1987.1&#13;
The study, which analyzed the extent of deterioration of inter-urban main road networks in 85 countries&#13;
receiving highway subsector assistance from the Bank (including IDA), came to some startling&#13;
'World Bank Policy Study. Road Deterioration in Developing Countries: Causes and Remedies. 1988.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                     15&#13;
conclusions. A quarter of the paved roads outside urban areas required reconstruction in the mid-1980s,&#13;
as did a third of unpaved roads. In addition, another 40 percent of the paved roads of these countries&#13;
required strengthening. The estimated cost of restoring these roads was US$90 billion. If the countries&#13;
did not improve their management of roads, the eventual cost could easily increase by two or three times,&#13;
and the cost to road users would rise even more.&#13;
3.4          Concerned at the ever-growing backlog of road maintenance in borrowing countries, the&#13;
Bank has adopted many of the recommendations of the above policy study in its sector work and&#13;
investment projects. These include: (a) improvement in road planning and programming, including more&#13;
reliable information and management methods and the application of economic criteria, (b) strengthening&#13;
and reform of institutional performance, particularly by contracting out more maintenance activities to&#13;
the private sector, (c) reallocation of resources to balance construction and maintenance with increased&#13;
allocation of expenditures to reduce the maintenance backlog, and (d) improving the financing of roads,&#13;
particularly by the adoption of rational road user charge systems. Lending for roads is generally&#13;
conditional on countries having an appropriate balance of expenditure among new construction,&#13;
restoration and maintenance, depending on the level of road deterioration, and on having a system of road&#13;
user charges that generates most of the resources needed to keep the roads in reasonable condition.&#13;
3.5          Also, the experience with the Earthquake Rehabilitation Project provided valuable lessons&#13;
about how to create competitive conditions in the construction industry. While the Highway Project will&#13;
involve different companies and Government institutions, these lessons have been drawn upon in the&#13;
design of this project, as has the Bank's experience with road maintenance generally.&#13;
D. Highway Sector Strategy for Armenia&#13;
3.6           The recommendations of the Bank's Road Deterioration Policy Paper are reflected in the&#13;
Armenian government's strategy for the highway subsector, along with other factors that are specific to&#13;
the Armenian situation. The strategy includes: (a) restructuring the highway maintenance organization&#13;
by turning over the maximum amount of its operations to private sector contractors operating on a&#13;
competitive basis, (b) building a small but strong road management organization that utilizes the most&#13;
efficient technology and effective quality control over the private contractors that it employs, (c)&#13;
developing a competitive contracting industry for both construction  and periodic and routine&#13;
maintenance; (d) improving road planning, including the development of various road management&#13;
systems; (e) shifting the utilization of budget resources to an emphasis on maintenance rather than new&#13;
construction, and (f) instituting road user charges as a basis of providing the resources needed for an&#13;
adequate level of maintenance.&#13;
3.7          In the past, the level of road maintenance was adequate, but budget constraints during&#13;
the past three years have reduced maintenance activities below the levels needed to preserve a functional&#13;
road system. Also, some of the materials and equipment used in highway maintenance were of inferior&#13;
quality, construction and maintenance equipment is now old and technically inferior, and operational&#13;
systems have not kept up with improved methods now in use in most developed and some developing&#13;
countries. The transition from an operation run entirely as a state enterprise to private contracting has&#13;
begun but is still in its infancy.&#13;
3.8           The challenge for Armenia is to increase its highway maintenance operations on an urgent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                         The Bank's Experience and Strategy&#13;
basis before pavement deterioration proceeds to the point where costly rehabilitation is required, and to&#13;
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its highway maintenance operations for the future. This will&#13;
require a higher level of spending on periodic and routine maintenance in the short run, combined with&#13;
the use of strict quality control, better equipment, and operational procedures including cost benefit&#13;
analysis as a basis for decision-making. It also includes the strengthening of ARD so that it becomes&#13;
an effective agency for managing the road maintenance program for the country, developing the skills&#13;
necessary for operating the road maintenance program on a contract basis instead of by force account&#13;
operations, privatization of the country's other road construction and maintenance organizations and&#13;
developing an effective private sector construction industry that can carry out road maintenance and&#13;
construction on a competitive basis.&#13;
3.9           The Bank's strategy for the highway subsector is to assist the Government in meeting this&#13;
challenge through a lending operation that would support expanded maintenance operations with priority&#13;
given to the main connecting routes that link Armenia to its sources of supply and its export markets,&#13;
improvements in operational procedures and techniques used in road maintenance activities, and assisting&#13;
in the institutional changes outlined in the previous paragraph, while encouraging the Government to&#13;
increase the resources available to meet the future need for road maintenance through instituting&#13;
appropriate road user charges. The project would also include assistance by several bilateral donors that&#13;
are providing technical assistance and training in support of these objectives. The IDA credit would help&#13;
to coordinate these various donor activities in the subsector. In the longer run, the Bank's strategy would&#13;
include assistance to expand the road network's capacity as the need for this expansion becomes more&#13;
apparent and if requested to do so by the Government.&#13;
3.10          The proposed project would, however, only meet a portion of the deferred maintenance&#13;
requirements of the national road network, which exceed US$100 million based on the best available&#13;
information at this time (see para. 2.4). The periodic maintenance requirements of the 1,411 km of paved&#13;
Interstate highways were estimated to cost US$20.3 million based on the survey carried out by TecnEcon&#13;
in 1994 (see Annex B), while the project provides for only US$18.6 million for this purpose.&#13;
Furthermore, the pavements are undergoing continual deterioration, and the actual cost of this work will&#13;
no doubt be greater because more costly forms of treatment will be required on some sections of road&#13;
than was the case in 1994 when the study was made. Also, the project does not provide any financing&#13;
for periodic maintenance for the remaining portions of the road network. While the project will make&#13;
an important contribution to preserving the most important part of the network, substantially more funds&#13;
will be needed to restore it fully, and a substantially higher annual budget allocation will be required to&#13;
maintain the roads thereafter. Therefore, this project can be considered as an interim step in a longer&#13;
process that will encourage the mobilization of domestic resources but which will also require further&#13;
donor support in the future to address the large backlog of deferred maintenance.&#13;
E. Government Attitude Toward Borrowing for the Highway Subsector&#13;
3.11         The Government is fully committed to the transition to a sustainable, growing market-&#13;
based economy. It recognizes the need to maintain economic stability through the exercise of budget&#13;
restraint, but also realizes the importance of an adequate level of maintenance in order to preserve the&#13;
infrastructure that is critical for its future development. Specifically, it recognizes the key role of the&#13;
highway network as part of that infrastructure. The Government sees foreign borrowing as a means of&#13;
expanding its maintenance spending levels on a non-inflationary basis in the short run while it improves&#13;
its ability to levy taxes through the introduction of user charges. At the same time, the Government is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                      17&#13;
reluctant to borrow any more than necessary, and prefers to utilize grant funds for technical assistance&#13;
requirements wherever possible.&#13;
F. Budget Issues and Road User Charges&#13;
3.12         The Government's ability to carry out its strategy for the road sector will depend on its&#13;
ability to generate the resources needed to do so. As described in para. 2.19, spending for road&#13;
maintenance has been drastically reduced over the past three years because of the collapse of the&#13;
Government's tax base. While foreign borrowing can mitigate the effects of that reduction for a limited&#13;
period of time, over the longer run the Government must be able to generate the resources needed for&#13;
maintenance from its own recurrent revenue collections. Also, road users should be required to pay the&#13;
costs associated with maintaining the road network in order to put decisions made in the transport sector&#13;
on a comparable basis with other transport modes. The newly proposed levies on fuel imports from non-&#13;
CIS countries and vehicle registration fees are a move in the right direction but do not go far enough to&#13;
meet the cost of road maintenance. The Government has already decided on some, at least interim,&#13;
measures, as described in paras 2.22 and 2.23.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                             The Project&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
4.1          The objectives of the Highway Project are to assist in preserving the Armenian road&#13;
network, thereby avoiding costly rehabilitation or reconstruction at a later date, and to improve the&#13;
efficiency of Armenia's road maintenance operations for the future. The specific objectives are to:&#13;
(i)    Help preserve the Armenian national road network and reduce transport operating costs&#13;
by expanding maintenance operations, including bridge and tunnel rehabilitation.&#13;
(ii)    Help develop an institutional framework adapted to the requirements of the road sector&#13;
of a market economy.&#13;
(iii)   Expand the resource base for road maintenance by encouraging appropriate road user&#13;
charges.&#13;
(iv)   Assist in developing an effective private road construction and engineering industry.&#13;
(v)   Improve road safety.&#13;
4.2          The first and second objectives stated above would help to preserve a functioning&#13;
transport network needed to support the development of a vigorous market-based economy in accordance&#13;
with the objectives of the Bank's strategy in Armenia. The third and fourth objectives are consistent with&#13;
IDA's desire to assist in the transformation from a centrally planned economy to one based on cost&#13;
analysis and private sector operations, and the fifth objective has obvious social benefits for the economy.&#13;
The project would also serve to identify the size and scope of future highway maintenance requirements.&#13;
B. Project Description.&#13;
4.3          An IDA Credit of US$16 million combined with co-financing from the Kuwait Fund,&#13;
France and the EU would finance a four year program of urgently needed highway maintenance and a&#13;
program of technical assistance and training directed toward institutional strengthening and improved&#13;
efficiency of Armenia's road maintenance operations. The total project cost is estimated at US$36.9&#13;
million. The main components of the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)    Periodic Highway Maintenance (US$18.6 million).  Surface dressing of about 1,200&#13;
km, overlays for about 205 km, and reconstruction of about 23 km of roads of the&#13;
Interstate Road Network. Priority would be given to the main trade routes that connect&#13;
Armenia to its external suppliers and markets for its exports.&#13;
(b)    Bridges and Tunnels (US$2.8 million). The repair of priority bridges and tunnels, and&#13;
the provision of equipment needed to establish and begin operation of a bridge inspection&#13;
system.&#13;
(c)    Materials for Routine Maintenance (US$2.6 million).  Bitumen for the routine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              19&#13;
maintenance of the entire paved national road network and fuel for winter maintenance&#13;
would be financed under the project in order to expand the amount of routine and winter&#13;
maintenance to be carried out by ARD.&#13;
(d)    Eguipment and Spare Parts (US$5.7 million).  Equipment needed to permit the&#13;
introduction of new technology and improved quality of road repairs, and spare parts&#13;
needed to keep existing equipment functioning.&#13;
(e)    Institutional Strengthening and Technical Upgrading (US$2.2).  Consultant services,&#13;
equipment and training to assist ARD to reshape its organization and operational&#13;
procedures so that both routine and periodic maintenance can be carried out on a contract&#13;
basis with private contractors instead of on a force account basis, to introduce cost benefit&#13;
techniques, to improve quality control, to improve planning, road research and&#13;
technology transfer capabilities, to develop and start implementing a road safety plan, to&#13;
install a system of axle weight controls, to carry out a study on financing of road&#13;
maintenance and generally to improve the efficiency of operations for road maintenance.&#13;
This component would also include training for the private road construction industry in&#13;
contracting procedures, business administration and project management.&#13;
(f)    Project Implementation (US$0.6 million). Support for an office within the ARD to&#13;
manage project activities, including the preparation of specifications and bidding&#13;
documents, handling procurement and project accounting, and the arrangements for&#13;
training activities financed by the project.&#13;
The project cost estimate also includes physical contingencies as well as price contingencies calculated&#13;
on the basis of estimated worldwide inflation over the project period for a total of US$4.4 million.&#13;
4.4           Selection for Periodic Maintenance. An analysis of the need for periodic maintenance&#13;
for the main road network was made by TecnEcon, a British consulting firm, and published as "The&#13;
Armenia Highway Survey" dated September 1994. The study was financed by the Commission of the&#13;
European Communities. TecnEcon surveyed the entire 1440 km of main roads and evaluated their&#13;
condition, traffic volume, and the cost of alternate types of treatment, selecting the treatments and&#13;
segments with the highest internal rates of return. On this basis, TecnEcon recommended surface&#13;
dressings, overlays and reconstruction on the basis of the highest Economic Internal Rates of Return&#13;
(EIRR) for each road segment. TecnEcon recommended that the use of the "mixed-in-place" recycling&#13;
process should be considered for overlays, whereby the old surface is milled and reprocessed, mixed with&#13;
some new materials, and reapplied. The use of slurry seals was suggested for consideration for surface&#13;
dressings. Rates of return ranged from 11 to over 100 percent. The World Bank Highway Design and&#13;
Maintenance Model (HDM.III) was used, based on a Net Present Value (NPV) discount rate of 10&#13;
percent, to rank the various road segments.&#13;
4.5           The IDA staff reviewed the cost estimates used in the TecnEcon report and concluded that&#13;
lower costs could be achieved under Armenian conditions. Revised cost estimates were used as a basis&#13;
for recalculating the optimal type of surface treatment, and the EIRRs were recalculated. The revised&#13;
results are shown in Annex B. Additional deterioration can be expected over the life of the project, and&#13;
consequently the choice of the repaving to be carried out would be based on annual inspections and a&#13;
recalculation of rates of return based on the same methodology as used by TecnEcon and the IDA staff&#13;
in making the original selection. Because of the continuing deterioration of the road network before&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20                                                                               The Project&#13;
resurfacing can be carried out, the proportion of overlays and reconstruction will be higher than shown&#13;
in Annex B and the total cost of the repaving of the Interstate network will be substantially greater,&#13;
although the overall project EIRR is expected to be around the same level as shown for the original&#13;
calculations. The HDM methodology will also be used by ARD for all investments in the road sector&#13;
during the life of the project, whether financed by the project or by other sources, and only investments&#13;
with a positive Net Present Value, based on the cost of capital of 12 percent, will be undertaken.&#13;
Assurances on these points were obtained during negotiations (see para. 6.1 (i)).&#13;
4.6           Support for Routine Maintenance. The condition of the remaining 6400 km of the&#13;
national road network is also now deteriorating rapidly, but considered of somewhat lower priority than&#13;
the 1440 km of main roads because of their lower traffic volumes. It is important, however, that these&#13;
roads receive some emergency treatment during the four year life of the project even though budget&#13;
constraints will limit this to the filling of potholes and other priority routine maintenance activities, at&#13;
least in the early years. Also, the difficult winter conditions in Armenia's mountainous terrain makes it&#13;
necessary to devote some resources to winter maintenance if the roads are to remain operational during&#13;
the winter months. Therefore, the project includes funding for the provision of imported materials&#13;
needed for these purposes such as bitumen, vehicle fuel and spare parts. The Government's own budget&#13;
will need to finance the other costs of the routine and winter maintenance operations as well as some&#13;
repaving of this part of the road network as its budget resources increase during the life of the project&#13;
(see para. 4.17).&#13;
4.7           Bridges and Tunnels. Several important bridges are in poor condition and need repairs&#13;
to assure that the highways remain functional. The highest priority bridges to repair have been identified&#13;
through visual inspection and costed. Also, one tunnel has been identified that needs relining, a new&#13;
drainage system and other repairs to remain operational. This component also includes the equipment&#13;
and technical assistance needed to start and begin operation of a bridge inspection system, something that&#13;
has been totally lacking in Armenia up to now. The introduction of the bridge inspection system would&#13;
be carried out under contract with one of the design institutes, supported by an international consultant.&#13;
(see para. 4.31).&#13;
4.8           Procedures for Awarding Civil Works. In the past, all work was carried out on a force&#13;
account basis, as described in Chapter II. However, the Government's decision to privatize all of the&#13;
construction capacity and most of the engineering capability of the ARD requires a new modus vivendi.&#13;
In the future, resources will be allocated through the use of contractual arrangements, with competitive&#13;
bidding used. Specifically, all repaving work (surface dressing, overlays and reconstruction) and bridge&#13;
and tunnel repairs will be procured through competitive bidding procedures, with bidding open to the&#13;
District Enterprises (subject to their eligibility under clause 1.8 (c) of the 1995 World Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines) and also to other emerging contractors as well as foreign firms. Routine and winter&#13;
maintenance, financed from ARD's budget, will in the first two years be awarded through negotiated&#13;
contracts with the District Enterprise in each geographic area. In subsequent years this work will also&#13;
be awarded after competitive bidding. This will allow ARD and the newly privatized District Enterprises&#13;
some time to adjust to the new arrangements. Engineering design, the preparation of bidding documents&#13;
and the supervision of the civil works contracts will be awarded on a competitive basis after the&#13;
submission of proposals from a short list of qualified engineering firms. All IDA financed contracts will&#13;
be processed in accordance with the January 1995 World Bank Procurement Guidelines and August 1981&#13;
Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                               21&#13;
4.9           Equipment and Spare Parts. There is an abundance of equipment available to the ARD's&#13;
District Enterprises (see Table 2.3), but much of it is in poor condition or is not capable of producing&#13;
work of adequate quality. It is not the intention of the project to re-equip the District Enterprises&#13;
completely, since they will be privatized soon. However, it is necessary to provide some types of&#13;
equipment that are essential to the use of new technology and to improve the quality of the work, as well&#13;
as to provide critical spare parts, as identified in Annex C, while relying on the existing equipment pool&#13;
for the bulk of the needs during the next few years. In order that the new equipment can be available&#13;
to all aspiring contractors on an equal basis, title to these items will be kept by the ARD, held in an&#13;
equipment pool and made available to successful bidders on a rental basis for carrying out the work&#13;
contracted with ARD. Rental rates will be set at a level adequate to cover the depreciation of equipment,&#13;
its maintenance, and a reasonable rate of return on the investment, and adjusted annually to ensure that&#13;
the amounts collected in the equipment rental account are adequate to maintain its value in real terms.&#13;
Rental rates for this equipment will be published prior to bidding dates so that all bidders will have an&#13;
equal cost basis for its use. Assurances were obtained at negotiations regarding these rental procedures&#13;
(para. 6.1 (ii)). Also, there is an urgent need for spare parts to make existing equipment operational.&#13;
Project funds up to a total amount of US$ 500,000 will be used in the first year for this purpose.&#13;
4.10          Institutional Strengthening. Technical Up,eradinR and Training. This component of the&#13;
project will assist the ARD to revise its organization to be consistent with the revised operational mode&#13;
described above, which relies primarily on contracting of both routine and winter maintenance for&#13;
carrying out the work. This change is so fundamental that it calls for a radical restructuring into a&#13;
smaller, highly efficient and concentrated organization rather than a gradual, long-term development of&#13;
the existing institution. New skills including strategic planning based on the use of cost benefit&#13;
techniques, the management of competitive contracting, improved construction quality control through&#13;
the use of engineering consultants, improving the data bank for recording the condition of roads, bridges&#13;
and tunnels, and upgrading the design and construction standards and material specifications will all be&#13;
needed. A road safety program, based on the Road Safety Plan being prepared with a grant from the&#13;
Netherlands (para 2.9), will include road safety measures to reduce the high accident rate in Armenia.&#13;
Axle weight controls will be instituted, with the addition of a mobile weigh bridge and a monitoring&#13;
system to enforce the legal load limits in order to protect the road network from overloaded vehicles.&#13;
4.11          The basic approach to development of a new organizational structure to manage the&#13;
maintenance of the public road network would be through the establishment of a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) within the ARD and under the supervision of the ARD Director General (see Annex E). The&#13;
office would be staffed by high quality staff recruited in part from the ranks of ARD and augmented by&#13;
new hires from outside of the organization in cases where new skills are required. This office would be&#13;
responsible for planning, budgeting, contracting and procurement, and management of the equipment&#13;
pool. It would manage the road safety program, and would be responsible for the installation of axle&#13;
weight controls. It would also be responsible for the institutional strengthening of ARD and the road&#13;
contractors through arranging of training programs, serving as a channel for technical information&#13;
available from outside of Armenia, and serving as the link to foreign technical assistance. The PIU&#13;
would over time become the nucleus of a revised and strengthened ARD, and would be merged with the&#13;
remainder of the ARD's operations at the completion of the project. During project implementation the&#13;
PIU would utilize the services of the several design institutes as well as private engineering firms for the&#13;
preparation of specifications and bidding documents, and for providing engineering supervision for the&#13;
civil works components of the project. Six months before the expected Closing Date, a study would be&#13;
carried out with technical assistance provided under the project to determine the best way to integrate the&#13;
PIU into the ARD structure after project completion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                             The Project&#13;
4.12         The institutional strengthening component of the project would be supported by a grant&#13;
from the EU that would fund the technical assistance to develop the new administrative skills needed such&#13;
as contracting, procurement, and budgeting, and the expertise needed to carry out the Road Safety Plan&#13;
that is being developed with financial assistance from The Netherlands, as described in para. 2.9. The&#13;
qualifications of the consultants will be to the satisfaction of the Bank. Technical assistance would also&#13;
be provided to help the Ministry of Transport and Communications establish a viable system of vehicle&#13;
registration, and for the collection of other road user charges as these are enacted into law. The technical&#13;
upgrading that would be undertaken would be provided through technical assistance financed by a grant&#13;
from the French Government and administered by the French Road Directorate. A list of consultants to&#13;
be provided under the project for institutional strengthening and technical upgrading is in Annex M.&#13;
4.13         Training would be provided from both of these funding sources, supplemented by funding&#13;
from the IDA credit. The training would also include a program to address the most urgent needs of the&#13;
evolving private road construction industry, including subjects such as: bidding, bid evaluation, cost and&#13;
quality control and general conditions of contract. On issues such as business administration it would be&#13;
broad-based, intended as a means of familiarizing industry personnel with the needs of private sector&#13;
operations. This training would be provided by consultants through seminars and training sessions held&#13;
in Armenia for all members of the industry who wish to participate. Existing training institutions in&#13;
Armenia would be utilized to the extent possible. The need for further training would be identified and&#13;
if possible incorporated in the curricula of existing training institutions. A summary of the Project&#13;
Training Program is included as Annex D. In addition to the formal training program, the contracts let&#13;
in connection with the maintenance program and for engineering design and supervision would also&#13;
provide growth opportunities for the construction industry. It is likely that not all of the District&#13;
Enterprises would survive the transition from public to private companies. However, the application of&#13;
training, routine maintenance contracts and competitive bidding for repaving and reconstruction should&#13;
provide an opportunity for the more competent of these organizations to evolve into successful contractors&#13;
during the life of the project.&#13;
4.14         Proiect Administration. The PIU described in para. 4.11 would be supported by the&#13;
project through the provision of office equipment and supplies, vehicles, a generator to assure a supply&#13;
of electric power, and office operating costs including salaries for the staff of the PIU in addition to the&#13;
technical assistance described in Annex M.&#13;
C. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
4.15         The estimated total cost of the project is US$36.9 million, net of taxes and duties (as&#13;
agreed by the Government), including physical and price contingencies. The foreign component is&#13;
US$29.6 million, equivalent to 80 percent of total project costs. Foreign costs were estimated in US$&#13;
at March 1995 prices and include physical contingencies of 10 percent for materials, equipment and civil&#13;
works. Price contingencies for foreign costs, amounting to US$1.2 million, were based on average&#13;
annual forecasts of inflation for foreign supplied goods and services of 2.2 percent per annum. Local cost&#13;
estimates took into account a significant real increase in wages and other local costs that is expected to&#13;
occur by the end of 1995. Price contingencies for local costs, amounting to US$0.3 million, were based&#13;
on the assumption that further real increases in local costs would be relatively modest after 1995. The&#13;
estimated cost of the project is given in detail in Annex F and is summarized in Table 4.1 below.&#13;
&#13;

4.16         IDA would finance US$16.0 million or 43 percent of total project costs; the Kuwait Fund&#13;
would finance US$15 million of the civil works and equipment components; France and the EU would&#13;
provide US$2.0 million equivalent of grant financing for technical assistance and training; and the&#13;
Government of Armenia would finance US$3.9 million, plus any duties and taxes payable on items&#13;
procured for the project. The IDA credit would finance part of the contracted civil works; part of the&#13;
imported materials, equipment and supplies; a portion of the contract services, technical assistance and&#13;
training; and operating expenses for the PIU, including salaries, office equipment and vehicles, office&#13;
supplies, and other operating costs. France and the EU would finance the balance of the technical&#13;
assistance and training. The Financing Plan for the project would be as follows:&#13;

4.17         One of the project objectives is to expand the resource base for road maintenance by&#13;
encouraging appropriate road user charges. An initial set of road user charges is to be activated on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                                               The Project&#13;
basis of laws already on the books, and a more appropriate set of charges is to be put before the&#13;
Parliament sometime after July 1995, as described in paras. 2.22 and 2.23. Given the country's present&#13;
economic conditions, recovery from the road users of a level of charges adequate to cover all of the road&#13;
maintenance costs will be difficult to achieve until the country achieves higher levels of economic growth.&#13;
Ultimately, however, the Government should be seeking to collect a level of such charges of at least&#13;
US$25 million annually, based on preliminary estimates of the level of resources needed to maintain the&#13;
national road network (see para. 2.24). In order to secure the maximum possible financing for road&#13;
maintenance under present conditions, assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (i) the Government&#13;
will make available to ARD each year during the life of the project the level of budget resources needed&#13;
to finance its share of project activities; (ii) the Government will provide ARD with an increased level&#13;
of resources, as a minimum increased at the same rate as increases in the Government's overall revenues,&#13;
to provide for road maintenance not covered by project activities; (iii) not later than January 1, 1997 the&#13;
Government will complete a study to: (a) review the experience with the road user charges already in&#13;
effect; (b) determine the required level of financing needed to maintain the entire road network; and (c)&#13;
recommend possible financing and collection mechanisms necessary to achieve this level; and (iv) by not&#13;
later than July 1, 1997 the Govermnent will implement the recommendations on financing and collection&#13;
mechanisms agreed with IDA (see paras.4.41 and 6. 1(iii)). Also, as a condition of effectiveness for the&#13;
IDA credit, the Government will put into effect a revised schedule of road user charges acceptable to IDA&#13;
(see para. 6.2).&#13;
D. Implementation&#13;
4.18          Project implementation would be the responsibility of ARD for all project components.&#13;
ARD is in the process of establishing the PIU under a Government decree that established an oversight&#13;
committee to authorize the creation of PIU's and to monitor their activities. The PIU will be integrated&#13;
into ARD upon project completion, based on the results of a study to determine the best way to integrate&#13;
the PIU with ARD (para. 4.11). ARD has already appointed a Project Director as head of the PIU who&#13;
is acceptable to IDA, and ARD would maintain and staff the PIU at a suitable level and operate it in&#13;
accordance with the implementation arrangements agreed between ARD and IDA during the life of the&#13;
project (para. 6.1 (iv)). The Project Director would serve as the primary person responsible for assuring&#13;
that the project is implemented efficiently and on schedule and for coordinating the inputs of the&#13;
cofinancing partners and the other Government agencies. He would be responsible for the preparation&#13;
of an Annual Work Program for the work that ARD plans to carry out in the coming year. The Annual&#13;
Work Program would be prepared by November 15 of each year and reviewed with IDA prior to being&#13;
put into effect (para. 6.1(v)). He would also be responsible for assuring that project accounts are kept,&#13;
commissioning audits, preparing periodic project progress reports, and would be the primary point of&#13;
contact with IDA.&#13;
4.19          Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A PPF for US$300,000 has been made available to&#13;
facilitate the completion of project preparation. The PIU has been set up and staff selected. Accounting&#13;
procedures are being established and contracts are being let for the preparation of specifications and&#13;
bidding documents for the first year's civil works, and for the training of staff in procurement&#13;
procedures. The PPF is also financing the transport of testing equipment needed to complete the strength&#13;
testing of pavements, which will be carried out with the assistance of the French Road Directorate.&#13;
Funds are being used for office equipment and supplies, a generator, transport of the testing equipment,&#13;
consultant fees for the preparation of bidding documents, a study tour by key members of the ARD staff&#13;
to observe how contracting arrangements work in other countries, and local salaries for the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           25&#13;
administration office staff.&#13;
E. Status of Cofinancing&#13;
4.20         The Kuwait Fund has indicated its willingness to provide US$15 million for the civil&#13;
works components of the project, subject to completion of an appraisal and the approval of its Board.&#13;
It is planning on an appraisal in October 1995, which will be joined by IDA, and expects to present the&#13;
project to its Board in February 1996. Kuwait's financing would be on a parallel financing basis, and&#13;
the division of components between the Kuwait Fund and IDA has been arranged so that each financing&#13;
package would be economically valid on its own. France and the EU would provide the support for the&#13;
technical improvements and institutional strengthening as noted above.  The Netherlands has already&#13;
agreed to finance the preparation of the Road Safety component of the project, and Japan has financed&#13;
the preparation of the institution strengthening component. IDA and the cofinanciers would arrange joint&#13;
supervision missions during project implementation.&#13;
F. Retroactive Financing&#13;
4.21         There is considerable urgency to expand the maintenance work on Armenia's road&#13;
network after three years of greatly reduced budgets, as discussed in para 2.4.  Therefore, the&#13;
Government has requested that retroactive financing be permitted so that work can begin at an increased&#13;
level even before the credit financing becomes available. While this would only be useful if the&#13;
Government can advance some additional financing to ARD prior to the effectiveness of the IDA Credit,&#13;
the Minister of Finance indicated that this could be done if the funds could be reimbursed promptly after&#13;
the Credit becomes effective. Therefore, the proposed Credit Agreement contains a provision for&#13;
retroactive financing for project expenditures incurred after March 15, 1995 for up to US$1 million,&#13;
which is the maximum amount that the Government is likely to be able to advance to ARD in 1995.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
4.22         The procurement arrangements over the project period are included in Annex H while&#13;
Table 4.3 summarizes the project elements, their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement.&#13;
The details of procurement arrangements are set forth in the Procurement Plan and Schedule in Annex&#13;
1. ARD will use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents and procurement procedures for IDA financed&#13;
contracts will be in accordance with the January 1995 World Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;

4.23            Goods, The procurement is designed to assist the development of a construction industry&#13;
in Armenia. Spare parts for existing equipment owned by the District Enterprises, which are presently&#13;
part of ARD, will be purchased by International Shopping during the first year of the project. Bitumen&#13;
for routine maintenance at a total value of $1.0 million will be financed by IDA and procured using ICB.&#13;
There would be two ICB contracts of around $500,000 for imported bitumen for two construction seasons&#13;
and there would be three ICB contracts for packages of equipment financed by IDA of around $1 million&#13;
each. All contracts for imported materials estimated to cost more than $300,000 equivalent each would&#13;
be procured through ICB. Bitumen and fuel for the first construction season estimated to cost up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of $300,000 may be awarded on the basis of International Shopping. This is for urgent&#13;
routine maintenance to be carried out on a force account basis during the first year of the project,&#13;
financed from the Government's own resources but with the goods purchased from abroad subject to&#13;
retroactive financing. For the equipment and supplies, items or groups of items estimated to cost&#13;
$300,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount of $600,000, may be procured under contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from at least&#13;
two different countries, and contracts up to an aggregate amount of $200,000, may be awarded under&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           27&#13;
direct negotiations with suppliers. Prior review by IDA would apply to all goods contracts above&#13;
$300,000, and to all Direct Contracting regardless of contract value. In order to encourage domestic&#13;
production, goods manufactured in Armenia will be given preference in bid evaluation for goods to be&#13;
awarded on the basis of ICB, as specified in Appendix 2 of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
4.24         Civil Works. There would be one ICB contract around $1.8 million for an asphalt&#13;
pavement recycling contract. Other civil works contracts less than US$500,000 for surface dressing,&#13;
overlay works, and reconstruction would follow the NCB procedure using the Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents- Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works-Local Competitive Bidding (Small Works),&#13;
July 1994, with foreign contractors allowed to bid. Sections of roads selected for overlays would be&#13;
grouped into suitable contract packages and each contract period would be kept within one construction&#13;
season. There would be around 20 NCB civil works contracts financed jointly by IDA and the&#13;
Government, each contract valued at an average of US$445,000 for an accumulated cost estimated at&#13;
US$8.9 million (including contingencies). In order to encourage the development of the local contracting&#13;
industry, domestic contractors will be given preference when comparing bids for works to be awarded&#13;
on the basis of ICB, as specified in Appendix 2 of the Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
4.25         Prior review would apply to all ICB works contracts and all NCB works contracts above&#13;
$300,000 and is expected to include 70 percent of the total value of IDA financed contracts. In any event&#13;
the first two NCB contracts would be subject to prior review. This level of review for NCB contracts&#13;
should be adequate to assure good quality preparation considering the repetitive nature of these contracts,&#13;
and may be revised upward during implementation subject to prior approval by IDA. Prequalification&#13;
would be used for the ICB works contract. For NCB work contracts the postqualification method would&#13;
be used and the qualification criteria would be set out in the bidding documents.&#13;
4.26         The introduction of competitive bidding procedures raises a number of issues that grow&#13;
out of the restructuring of force-account agencies and an infant industry. Where NCB for works would&#13;
be used, the criteria would be suitable to the size and kind of work to be carried out. An anticipated area&#13;
of difficulty is the perceived inability for the newly established private firms to meet financial criteria.&#13;
The construction firms have their accounts audited for control purposes only, if at all. Their accounting&#13;
methodology does not include western type depreciation of assets and it might be difficult to determine&#13;
their credit-worthiness. It may be necessary to accept nominal solvency with a performance guarantee&#13;
and retention money to limit potential damage or default. The project will include training that would&#13;
assist the construction firms to update their accounting systems and to facilitate western style audits.&#13;
4.27         NCB contracts would be in US dollars, but Armenian contractors would be paid in Drams&#13;
at the official exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment. Disbursement for local contracts would&#13;
be made from the Special Account since it will be important to ensure that the contractors receive&#13;
payment promptly.&#13;
4.28         Bid bonds, performance bonds, and advance payment guarantees might become a problem&#13;
as neither contractors nor most of the banks are experienced in this area and because of the uncertain&#13;
credit worthiness of the local contractors. The post qualification criteria will be adopted to address the&#13;
above problems, and it will be necessary to be flexible with regard to the kinds of security that will be&#13;
considered acceptable for contract guarantees.&#13;
4.29         Advances of up to 10 percent against a bank guarantee are recommended for works&#13;
contracts to assist with the execution of the project when materials are supplied by ARD and up to 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                               The Project&#13;
percent when materials are supplied by the contractor.&#13;
4.30          The eligibility of the contractors would be subject to their meeting the criteria outlined&#13;
under clause 1.8(c) of the January 1995 World Bank Procurement Guidelines. As described in para.&#13;
2.15, the Government is in process of privatizing the District Enterprises, which are expected to become&#13;
the principal road contractors since they possess the equipment and expertise to carry out the work.&#13;
4.31          Consultancies and Training. Consultants to be financed by IDA will be selected according&#13;
to the Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency (August, 1981). The major consultancy contracts financed by IDA are for project&#13;
implementation assistance such as preparation of bidding documents, designing the periodic maintenance&#13;
components, engineering supervision (estimated cost, US$600,000) and introduction of Bridge Inspection&#13;
and Bridge Data Bank Systems and reviewing the bridge rehabilitation design (estimated cost,&#13;
US$200,000). The PIU will also need a number of miscellaneous minor consultant services and training&#13;
programs, from consultant firms or individuals, estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each, for an&#13;
accumulated cost estimated at US$200,000. Since one of the objectives of the project is to develop an&#13;
effective road consultant industry, international and local consultants will be encouraged to associate with&#13;
local consultants. Selection of consultants would be made from proposals submitted by shortlisted firms,&#13;
except for some of the minor consultants services that will be sole sourced. Prior review by IDA would&#13;
apply to all IDA financed contracts for consulting services supplied by firms valued at more than&#13;
US$100,000 per contract, for individuals at more than US$50,000 per contract, and for all Terms of&#13;
Reference for assignments. Consultancies financed by other donors will be selected following their&#13;
selection procedures.&#13;
4.32          Miscellaneous. The Miscellaneous category includes the refinancing of the PPF for&#13;
US$300,000 and the payment of operating expenses for the PIU for US$400,000, which would include&#13;
staff salaries, utilities and maintenance, furnishings, and communications. The operating expenses would&#13;
be paid out of the Special Account against an annual budget prepared by ARD and approved by IDA.&#13;
4.33          ARD does not have experience in implementing this type of project. Therefore, technical&#13;
assistance would be provided under the project in such areas as preparation of bidding documents,&#13;
procurement, project management and supervision (para 4.31).&#13;
4.34          Procurement information will be collected by the PIU and reported to IDA as follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of bidding, bid evaluation results and contract award information; and&#13;
(b)    quarterly reports indicating: (i) project progress and problems; (ii) revised cost estimates&#13;
for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates for physical and&#13;
price contingencies; and (iii) revised schedules of procurement actions, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
4.35          Disbursements are expected to be completed in four years. An estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursements is shown in Annex J. The expected closing date is December 31, 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          29&#13;
4.36         The expenditures for contracts for goods and works valued at less than US$300,000,&#13;
contracts for services of consulting firms valued at less than USS 100,000, individual consulting services&#13;
valued at less than US$50,000 and operating expenses valued at less than US$20,000 would be financed&#13;
on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE) procedures in order to assist the borrower in making&#13;
timely payments. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not be sent to IDA, but would&#13;
be retained by the borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by external auditors. All other&#13;
disbursements would be fully documented. The minimum size of applications for direct payment and for&#13;
the issuance of Special Commitments would be 10 percent of the amount of the deposit to the Special&#13;
Account.&#13;
4.37         To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in&#13;
one of the major commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to cover IDA's share of&#13;
expenditures. The Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be US$1,000,000, representing&#13;
about four months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage&#13;
of the project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US$500,000. However,&#13;
when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached the level of US$3,000,000, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to the Authorized Allocation of US$1,000,000 by submitting the relevant&#13;
Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted&#13;
monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation&#13;
requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the&#13;
Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account, which have been&#13;
reconciled by the Borrower, would accompany all replenishment applications.&#13;
4.38         The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed on the following basis:&#13;

1. Reporting, Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.39         The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related&#13;
accounts will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial&#13;
statements of IDA-financed components will be prepared in a format acceptable to IDA and audited in&#13;
accordance with International Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified independent auditors acceptable&#13;
to IDA, and submitted to IDA within six months of the close of ARD's financial year. Audits will also&#13;
be carried out, at the same time, and for corresponding periods in accordance with IDA guidelines, for&#13;
SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made out of the credit proceeds, and&#13;
specific reference will be made in the audit reports accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
4.40         Quarterly progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by ARD and&#13;
sent to IDA within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will include: (a) progress&#13;
achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key performance indicators,&#13;
including number of contracts awarded and length of roads rehabilitated, maintained; and (b) work&#13;
programs and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project. The main purpose of the&#13;
reports will be to provide ARD timely and updated information on implementation of project components,&#13;
highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on progress in resolving&#13;
previous recommendations. ARD will also prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              31&#13;
accordance with IDA guidelines and submit it to IDA promptly after completion of the project but in any&#13;
event not later than six months after the credit closing date.&#13;
J. Project Supervision&#13;
4.41          Three Bank supervision missions each year, each staffed by a senior highway engineer&#13;
and such specialists as may be appropriate for each phase of the project (such as a procurement expert,&#13;
training expert, traffic safety specialist or financial analyst) would be required over the life of the project,&#13;
each of about one or two week duration. The total amount of supervision envisaged annually would be&#13;
18-24 staff weeks. A Project Launch Workshop would be held in October 1995 with instruction on Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, accounting procedures and reporting requirements. Subsequent missions would&#13;
review physical progress and would assist in coordinating the cofinanced elements of the project.&#13;
Cofinanciers would be invited to participate in all supervision missions.The project implementation&#13;
schedule and monitorable performance indicators are given in Annex G, and a schedule of supervision&#13;
missions is included as Annex K. A mid-term review would be held not later than November 1, 1997,&#13;
to assess the effectiveness of the project arrangements, to review the adequacy of Government budget&#13;
allocations for road maintenance and of road user charges, and for the reallocation of funds between&#13;
project categories if necessary based on the long term study described in para. 4.17 (para. 6.1 (vi)).&#13;
K. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.42          The routine and periodic maintenance operations included in the project are not expected&#13;
to generate any significant environmental problems since work would be done on existing roadways,&#13;
utilizing existing quarries and asphalt plants. Since the environmental risks are limited, this project has&#13;
been designated as Category B, indicating that an Environmental Assessment is not required. A brief&#13;
environmental review was carried out during project appraisal and the results are included in Annex L.&#13;
The review found that ARD's asphalt plants are generally located in remote areas, where the emission&#13;
of fumes is not an environmental problem, and the asphalt plants near Yerevan will not be used for the&#13;
project unless emissions are within MNEP standards. The MNEP must approve and license all quarries&#13;
from an environmental aspect, and this requirement, combined with monitoring by ARD, should control&#13;
the environmental problems relating to quarrying operations. Training to improve environmental analysis&#13;
and mitigation capabilities in the ARD, in particular in regard to design, construction and maintenance&#13;
activities, is included in the project. The MNEP is preparing a NEAP, which is expected to be available&#13;
in 1997, (See para. 2.36) as required by IDA for all IDA-recipient countries.&#13;
L. Program Objective Categories&#13;
4.43          The project would contribute directly to the sustainable development of Armenia by&#13;
preserving the road network, which is an important part of the country's essential infrastructure. It would&#13;
also make a significant contribution to the development of the private sector in Armenia through the&#13;
privatization of the road construction industry, and would assist small farmers and tradesmen in their&#13;
efforts to begin to develop private business ventures by assuring that they have access to markets for their&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                                               The Project&#13;
M. Particpatory Approach&#13;
4.44          During project preparation, the concept of participation was introduced by holding&#13;
workshops in which the managers and staff of ARD, the District Enterprises, the design institutes and&#13;
the related Ministries took part in discussions of the project methodology, the concepts of privatization&#13;
and competitive bidding, and the requirements of a market-based economic system. This approach was&#13;
an entirely new concept for a system used to an authoritarian command structure, but was accepted and&#13;
generally appreciated by all of the participants. The project would continue the participatory approach&#13;
begun during preparation by continuing to involve the important stakeholders in the road sector, including&#13;
the extensive network of persons employed by the District Enterprises, the design institutes, the Traffic&#13;
Police and the various Ministries involved in the sector.&#13;

Project Benefits and Sustainability                                                    33&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1          Periodic Maintenance Component. The project would greatly increase ARD's capacity&#13;
to carry out periodic highway maintenance of Armenia's public road network during a four year period&#13;
(1996-1999), thus prolonging the life of the highway system and avoiding costly rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction. The program would also reduce vehicle operating costs and maintenance as well as&#13;
reduced road accident risks, making Armenia a more attractive investment choice for potential investors.&#13;
An additional project benefit would be the experience that would be gained by the private construction&#13;
industry in carrying out road maintenance work on a competitive basis. The Estimated Internal Rate of&#13;
Return (EIRR) for the periodic maintenance component, which accounts for 57 percent of total project&#13;
cost, is expected to be 38 percent compared to not carrying out the project, based on savings in vehicle&#13;
operating costs and avoided costs of reconstruction. A sensitivity analysis was carried out with variable&#13;
estimates of traffic growth. The results showed that the economic returns are relatively insensitive to quite&#13;
large variations in assumed traffic growth, with most variations making no more than a two percent&#13;
difference in the EIRR compared to the medium traffic growth estimate used in the basic calculation (see&#13;
Annex B). The tunnel and bridge rehabilitation component (9 percent of total project cost) will only go&#13;
forward if the calculated results show a positive net present value, based on a capital cost of 12 percent.&#13;
No EIRR has been calculated for the routine maintenance component and supporting purchase of&#13;
equipment (26 percent of total project cost), but typically routine maintenance has produced large&#13;
savings in periodic maintenance costs.&#13;
5.2          Institutional Strengthening and Technical Improvement. This component provides for&#13;
the radical reform of ARD through the redesign of its organizational structure and a revision in the way&#13;
it carries out its responsibilities.   The effect of these changes is expected to be improved cost-&#13;
effectiveness in future highway maintenance through the use of cost-benefit analysis to determine&#13;
pavement management strategies, competitive contracting, improved quality control, and improved&#13;
technical methods through the introduction of new technologies and research. This component, which&#13;
accounts for seven percent of total project costs, does not lend itself to conventional economic rate of&#13;
return analysis, but typically reductions in maintenance costs through the adoption of similar techniques&#13;
in other countries have been substantial. It would also result in the development of an effective road&#13;
construction and engineering industry.&#13;
5.3          Road User Charges. The introduction of road user charges would result in an increased&#13;
ability of the Government to provide financing for road maintenance in the future, thus putting the road&#13;
network on a more sustainable basis.&#13;
5.4           Trade Facilitation. The maintenance of the main highway links to Armenia's external&#13;
markets and suppliers would increase Armenia's prospects for economic growth and development. This&#13;
is especially vital for a land-locked country with limited geographic access to other markets and with a&#13;
railway system in serious need of rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                           Project Benefits and Sustainability&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.5           The major risks to the project are the ability of ARD to establish an effective road&#13;
maintenance organization capable of carrying out the project activities, and the ability of the revised ARD&#13;
to use contracting techniques effectively. Also the imposition of road user charges at a time when the&#13;
economy is extremely depressed will be difficult and unpopular. And the importing of essential materials&#13;
is difficult and uncertain, and adds to the difficulty of accurately estimating costs. Regarding the first&#13;
point, this should be mitigated by the technical assistance being provided and the use of private&#13;
contractors that are not Government employees for the civil works requirements. In regard to user&#13;
charges, the Government has displayed keen interest in adopting a reasonable level of charges, and seems&#13;
to recognize that this is essential for the maintenance of the road network. As to importing, while there&#13;
are still some difficulties in this regard, the situation is improving as peace negotiations go forward.&#13;
Regarding the use of contracts, provision has been made to provide guidance to ARD by IDA&#13;
procurement specialists even before Board approval so that the bidding process gets off to a good start.&#13;
Familiarization sessions will also be organized for local construction industry personnel.&#13;
C. Project Sustainability&#13;
5.6           Project sustainability will depend to a large extent on the Government's ability to mobilize&#13;
an adequate level of resources for road maintenance after the end of the project period and to adjust&#13;
Government pay to reasonable levels after project disbursements are no longer available. This in turn&#13;
will depend on the level and kind of road user charges that are enacted. The Government appears&#13;
committed to the enactment of road user charges, and the kinds of charges that are under consideration&#13;
are appropriate ones. The efficiency improvements expected from the improved systems, technical&#13;
assistance and training components are likely to have a sustained impact on ARD's future operations if&#13;
salary levels can be increased to levels adequate to retain its technical staff. Also, the development of&#13;
the private road construction and engineering industries is likely to have a lasting impact.&#13;
&#13;

Agreements &amp; Recommendations                                                             35&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS &amp; RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1           During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following points:&#13;
(i)    ARD will use cost benefit analysis, in accordance with the principles agreed&#13;
between ARD and IDA, to determine the actual road segments to be repaired&#13;
under the project, as well as for all investments in the road sector during&#13;
execution of the project and will only undertake projects with a positive Net&#13;
Present Value, based on the cost of capital of 12 percent (para.4.5); [DCA,&#13;
Schedule 4, para 21.&#13;
(ii)    Prior to inviting bids for civil works, ARD will make public the list of equipment&#13;
available on a rental basis for work to be carried out by contractors under the&#13;
project, with uniform rental rates for all bidders; the rental rates will be set at&#13;
a level adequate to cover the depreciation of equipment, its maintenance, and a&#13;
reasonable rate of return on the investment (para. 4.9); [DCA, Schedule 4, para&#13;
31.&#13;
(iii)   The Borrower will make available to ARD each year during the life of the&#13;
project the level of budget resources needed to finance its share of project&#13;
activities [DCA, Section 3.01 (a)l; the Borrower will provide to ARD, promptly&#13;
as needed the budgetary resources for road maintenance not covered by the&#13;
project activities, at an increasing level not less than the rate of increase in the&#13;
Borrower's overall revenues [DCA, Section 4.02 (a)l; not later than January 1,&#13;
1997, the Borrower will carry out a study on: (a) the required level of financing&#13;
needed to maintain the Borrower's road network; and (b) the possible financing&#13;
and collection mechanisms for road maintenance [DCA, Schedule 4, para 6 (a)l;&#13;
not later than January 1, 1997, the Borrower will review with IDA the results&#13;
and recommendations of the above-mentioned study and not later than July 1,&#13;
1997, the Borrower will implement the recommendations on financing and&#13;
collection mechanisms agreed with IDA (para. 4.17); IDCA, Schedule 4, para&#13;
6 (b)l.&#13;
(iv)   ARD will maintain and suitably staff the Project Implementation Unit and will&#13;
operate it in accordance with the implementation arrangements agreed between&#13;
the Borrower and IDA (para. 4.18); [DCA, Schedule 4, para 11.&#13;
(v)    Before November 15 of each year during execution of the project, ARD shall&#13;
prepare annual work programs for the next calendar year and review these&#13;
programs with IDA before implementing them (para. 4.18); [DCA, Schedule 4,&#13;
para 41.&#13;
(vi)   Before November 15 of each year until completion of the project, the Borrower&#13;
shall submit to IDA an annual financing plan for the next fiscal year which shall&#13;
include, inter alia: (a) budget allocations for ARD to finance its share of project&#13;
activities; and (b) budget allocations for ARD to finance road maintenance not&#13;
covered by the project activities (para 4.18); IDCA, Section 4.02 (b)l.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(vii)  the Borrower shall: (a) maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to&#13;
monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, the carrying out of the project and the achievement of the&#13;
objectives thereof; and (b) review with IDA, by November 1, 1997, the progress&#13;
made in the implementation of the project; and shall take all necessary measures&#13;
to execute the actions identified and agreed upon between the Association and the&#13;
Borrower during such review. (para.4.41); IDCA, Schedule 4, para 51.&#13;
6.2          There are no conditions of Board Presentation. As a condition of effectiveness, the&#13;
Borrower will have adopted a revised schedule of road user charges acceptable to IDA (para. 4.17);&#13;
[DCA, Section 6.01]. Retroactive financing is proposed up to a level of US$I million for project&#13;
expenditures incurred after March 15, 1995 (para. 4.21).&#13;
6.3          Subject to the above, the proposed Highway Project is suitable for an IDA credit of&#13;
US$16 million equivalent to the Republic of Armenia at the standard IDA terms of 35 years, including&#13;
a grace period of ten years.&#13;

categories:&#13;
Category  1:  Good condition (average IRI below 4.0)&#13;
Category 2A: Fair condition (IRI from 4.0 to 5.0)&#13;
2B:     Fair condition (same IRI with cracking)&#13;
Category 3:  Moderate condition (IRI from 4.5 to 6.0 with up to 40 percent deteriorated)&#13;

The World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM III) was used to evaluate fine alternative&#13;
maintenance strategies, and an economic interest rate of return (EIRR) was calculated on the basis of the most cost&#13;
effective strategy compared to not carrying out the repairs. The fine strategies were:&#13;

A sensitivity analysis was carried out with variable estimates of traffic growth (high, medium and low). Tle results&#13;
showed that the economic returns are relatively insensitive to quite large variations in assumed traffic growth, with&#13;
most variations making no more than a two percent difference in the EIRR compared to the medium traffic growth&#13;
estimate.&#13;

SUMMARY OF TRAINING PROGRAM&#13;
Armenian Highway Project&#13;
1.1    A unified project component including institutional strengthening, technical upgrading, and&#13;
training will assist the Armenia Road Directorate (ARD) to revise the existing organization in order&#13;
to support operations keyed to cost effectiveness and the contracting of the majority of work to the&#13;
private sector. The training program will contain several elements based on the needs of specific&#13;
target groups.&#13;
1.2    The ARD, local design institutes, and the district enterprises will all require training in order&#13;
to operate as client, supervising consultants, and contractors. A package of training in business&#13;
management and contracting will target all three groups. A summary of this element is provided in&#13;
the attached matrix. In terms of numbers it represents the single largest training activity under the&#13;
project and will be administered under a contract to be negotiated with the American University of&#13;
Armenia (AUA). The majority of this training will be conducted during the calendar year 1995.&#13;
1.3    Three other types of training are proposed. Senior managers and engineers and will&#13;
participate in study tours to expose them to new approaches or technology; special training will&#13;
upgrade design and testing skills; practical technical training will offered for equipment operators&#13;
and mechanics. These elements would be implemented independently of but, as appropriate, in&#13;
consideration of or in coordination with the contract with AUA.&#13;
1.4   In view of radical transformation process underway, the training program will be iteratively&#13;
structured in order to enable revisions and supplemental actions over time. A Project Administrative&#13;
Office (PAO) will be established in the ARD to administer the project. The PAO will be responsible&#13;
for monitoring institutional strengthening, technical upgrading, and training; it will serve as the&#13;
coordinator for the overall package of training activities to be offered under the project.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The environmental review for the Armenia Highway Project (AHP) was conducted in&#13;
March 1995 in conjunction with the appraisal mission for the AHP. The review addressed&#13;
the requirements for IDA projects classed as "Category B" as opposed to the full&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) required for "Category A" projects. The requirements for a&#13;
full EA, however, were discussed as part of a workshop held under the sponsorship of IDA&#13;
in conjunction with the conduct of the appraisal mission for the AHP.1&#13;
1.2 The conduct of the review included consultations with the Armenian Road Directorate&#13;
(ARD), the Ministry of Nature and Environmental Protection (MNEP), the ARMGIPRODOR&#13;
Design Institute, the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Center for&#13;
Environmental Management of the American University of Armenia (AUA), and the State&#13;
Engineering University of Armenia (SEUA). Discussions with these agencies considered&#13;
existing policies and procedures as well as inter-agency consultative practices.&#13;
1.3   The review found the road rehabilitation and maintenance proposed for the&#13;
approximately 1440 kms of main highway under the AHP to be environmentally sound.&#13;
Although there are several long-term considerations relative to the environmental impact of&#13;
future road construction projects which will require further review, such issues lie outside the&#13;
context of activities proposed for the AHP.&#13;
II. DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
2. 1   The environmental impact of most rehabilitation and maintenance projects in the road&#13;
sector is seen as positive rather than negative. Assuming the retention of the existing&#13;
alignments--as is the case in this project--such projects offer not only more efficient vehicle&#13;
operation and a corresponding reduction in the emission of pollutants but also reduced noise&#13;
and vibrations from traffic as well as the opportunity to introduce mitigation actions relative&#13;
'/ The workcshop introduced road-related environmental issues within the broad context of future projects&#13;
which might also include new road construction as well as maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Page, 2 of 5&#13;
to existing threats.2 The major sources of directly negative impacts arising from maintenance&#13;
projects, therefore, are considered to arise from (1) the production and application of&#13;
bituminous products, (2) the quarrying of stone and gravels, and (3) such short-term impact&#13;
as noise, dust, and the disruption of traffic resulting from the execution of work under the&#13;
project. These three areas were each examined in the course of the review.&#13;
2.2    Asphalt Plant Production- According to the information provided by the ARD there&#13;
were over 50 different asphalt plants which had been under the authority of the ARD and had&#13;
been involved in the production of asphalt for the road sector (See Annex 1). When all were&#13;
in production they had a combined capacity of about 2,240 tons per hour. The ARD&#13;
reported that only about two-thirds of these plants were operational, and selected visual&#13;
inspections indicated that the figure was probably even lower. The plants in the best&#13;
condition--and seemingly the most efficient operations--were the ten Teltomat units produced&#13;
in the former East Germany. Assuming that production were limited to these ten plants, the&#13;
production of asphalt would be more than adequate in terms of the quantity of production and&#13;
geographic distribution for the purposes of the AHP.&#13;
2.3   In view of the highly limited operation of any of these plants during the past two to&#13;
four years, it was difficult to access either their efficiency or the potential threat from&#13;
effluents and suspended particles, except on the basis of a review of historic data. This issue&#13;
was discussed with both the ARD and the MNEP. Both organizations felt that since only the&#13;
better plants would be put back in operation for the AHP, compliance with national&#13;
regulatory guidelines could be maintained. Impact was expected to minimal, moreover,&#13;
because only the plants located near Yerevan were adjacent to densely populated areas. If&#13;
the plants near Yerevan failed to pass regulatory guidelines, they would not be used within&#13;
this project.&#13;
2.4    QuaOrations- According to the ARD there were approximately 37 different&#13;
quarries which had provided materials for use on road projects. About half of these&#13;
produced gravels. The others either produced rock for subsequent crushing or maintained&#13;
crushers on site to further process stone taken from the sites. The quantities estimated for&#13;
the AHP did not indicate the need for opening any new sites. The quarry sites expected to&#13;
be used for this project were distant from densely populated areas.&#13;
2.5   Instances were on record in the past when gravels were improperly taken from such&#13;
non-quarry sites as river beds, resulting in at least one case in a change in the course of the&#13;
river. In order to control such activities and to ensure minimum erosion and proper&#13;
restoration after the conclusion of quarry operations, the MNEP has established a new&#13;
licensing system for all quarry operations in Armenia. Under this new system all operations&#13;
2/ In those cases where rehabilitation under the project would require design, existing procedures would call for&#13;
an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed work. The review would be provided by&#13;
ARMGIPRODOR or another design source and be subject to approval by the MNEP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
page 3 of S&#13;
would be submitted to an environmental review in order to be licensed. The AHP would use&#13;
no sources for materials which were not licensed and reviewed under the new system.&#13;
2.6 Short-term Impact- Its is inevitable that there will be short-term impact from noise,&#13;
dust, and traffic congestion during the execution of works. The minimization of such impact&#13;
will be included in one of the modules on Construction Management which will be offered to&#13;
the district enterprises as part of the training program under the project; certification of&#13;
completion of these courses will be required by all enterprises interested in bidding on work&#13;
funded by the project. Contractors will be required to prepare a mitigation plan for any site&#13;
where the scale of impact is judged sufficiently significant; particular attention will be given&#13;
to road segments adjacent to residential areas.&#13;
Im.  INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
3.1  Indirect environmental impacts possibly arising from such a project as the AHP&#13;
include such long-term developments as increased traffic growth and increased traffic speed.&#13;
Although the rehabilitation and maintenance of the main network is a pre-requisite for such&#13;
developments, a far higher correlation exists between such developments and national&#13;
economic recovery.&#13;
3.2    The project does place considerable importance on the promotion of road traffic&#13;
safety, and resources will be made available for the initiation of a meaningful road traffic&#13;
safety program. Dialogue has already been initiated to ensure better communication and&#13;
cooperation between the organizations responsible for road traffic safety, and technical&#13;
assistance in support of road safety is to be provided under the project. The placement of&#13;
signs along right of ways to indicate wildlife crossings would be included under this&#13;
component.&#13;
IV. INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.1   The Ministry of Nature and Environmental Protection, upgraded from the status of a&#13;
State Commission in 1991, is the government organization responsible for making policy and&#13;
promulgating standards relative to environmental protection. The responsibility and authority&#13;
of the Ministry is broadly defined in Parliamentary decree No. 269, dated July 9, 1991.&#13;
Included under its mandate is environmental public education, research, and the support for&#13;
symbiotic solutions for infrastructure development and environmental protection. The MNEP&#13;
is in the process of preparing the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) as well as&#13;
reviewing a variety of policies and regulatory standards.&#13;
4.2   Regulatory and licensing systems currently exist which specifically require the&#13;
consideration of environmental issues in the design and implementation of development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Eag 4 of &#13;
projects. The MNEP must sign off on all designs for road works ranging from simple&#13;
modifications for rehabilitation to more comprehensive new construction. A review of&#13;
regulatory procedures indicates the need for a more pro-active stance by the MNEP and&#13;
design institutes relative to environmental protection. Increased attention should be given to&#13;
consistent application of the existing policies and procedures and continued monitoring&#13;
throughout the implementation of projects. This need was a subject discussed in the&#13;
workshop referenced above. As an initial step in capacity building for managing future&#13;
projects, this workshop also presented the basic documents and requirements of IDA relative&#13;
to EAs.&#13;
4.3   Air pollution has been a major problem for urban areas in Armenia for at least two&#13;
decades. Current levels have fallen as a result of the drastic down-turn in industrial&#13;
production, but average levels in certain cities in the early 1990s exceeded the average daily&#13;
Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC) by several times. Analysis included in the&#13;
Environmental Sector Report for Armenia prepared in early 1995 included the production of&#13;
construction materials--road materials being only one of several components-- among major&#13;
contributors to the air pollution in two of the five most heavily impacted areas (Yerevan and&#13;
Razdan).3 The MNEP is confident, however, that existing regulatory procedures are&#13;
adequate to ensure compliance by the AHP with national standards; additional review would&#13;
be required, however, for future projects involving major construction components.&#13;
4.4   Responsibility for environmental issues currently falls under the Technical Division of&#13;
the ARD. The Chief Engineer heading this division participated in the workshop held during&#13;
the Appraisal Mission and has been nominated for participation in a regional seminar on&#13;
environmental issues to be held in mid 1995. Although the current levels of skills are&#13;
adequate for the requirements of the AHP, training will be provided under the project as part&#13;
of a long-term institutional strengthening effort to upgrade the capacity of the ARD relative&#13;
to environmental issues. Particular emphasis will be given to the monitoring responsibilities&#13;
of the PIU relative to work undertaken under the AHP. Technical training to be provided to&#13;
ARMGIPRODOR and other design institutes, especially in conjunction with overseas training&#13;
and study, would also take into account environmental issues.&#13;
V.   BROADER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
5.1   During the Soviet Period Armenia was cut off from research and studies conducted&#13;
outside the Soviet Bloc relative to road construction and maintenance. During this period a&#13;
wide range of findings evolved with environmental implications relative to both the use of&#13;
materials and appropriate technologies. These findings needed to be reviewed by&#13;
environmental and design specialists in Armenia. Additional study may be required,&#13;
3/    Although there were some difficulties in making comparisons, the Sector Report suggests the need to&#13;
review the current Armenian standards in comparison to US/international standards. See Annex 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex L&#13;
Pge S of S&#13;
however, to assess the validity of these findings for the Armenian road network.&#13;
5.2 The project design phase has already resulted in the resumption of international&#13;
contacts and exchanges. Funding under the project would assist the resumption of internal&#13;
research at the design institute which would be primarily responsible for considering optimal&#13;
solutions for materials selection and technology keyed to environmental protection.&#13;
5.3   One of the central concerns of the AHP is quality control and the assurance of&#13;
compliance with design standards and specifications. This emphasis will also ensure future&#13;
compliance with specifications mandated in conjunction with the environmental clearance&#13;
process.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Highway Project
            are to assist in preserving the Armenian road network,
            thereby avoiding costly rehabilitation or reconstruction at
            a later date, and to improve the efficiency of
            Armenia's road maintenance operations for the future.
            The specific objectives are to: 1) help preserve the
            Armenian national road network and reduce transport
            operating costs by expanding maintenance operations,
            including bridge and tunnel rehabilitation; 2) help develop
            an institutional framework adapted to the requirements of
            the road sector of a market economy; 3) expand the resource
            base for road maintenance by encouraging appropriate road
            user charges; and 4) assist in developing an effective
            private road construction and engineering industry; and 5)
            improve road safety. The project components are: 1) periodic
            highway maintenance; 2) bridges and tunnels; 3) materials
            for routine maintenance; 4) equipment and spare parts; 5)
            institutional strengthening and technical upgrading; and 6)
            project implementation.
