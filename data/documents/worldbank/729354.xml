            Scorecard for subsidies - how utility
            subsidies perform in transition economies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Unlike the poor in many developing
            countries, those in Central and Eastern Europe, and the
            former Soviet Union, are highly connected to network
            utilities. During the early 1990s, it became clear that
            without subsidies, many households would have difficulty
            paying their utility bills. Governments started to
            experiment with various subsidy schemes. This note describes
            the main schemes, scoring those, based on the following
            criteria: the extent to which the poor are being reached,
            i.e., coverage; the share of the subsidy that goes to the
            poor, i.e., targeting; predictability of the benefit for the
            poor; the extent of pricing distortions, and other
            unintended side-effects; and, administration costs, and
            difficulty. Moreover, the note provides a methodology for
            governments designing subsidies, to decide which scheme is
            likely to be the best for their country.
