&amp;#12;&#13;
1. THE SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. The Economic and Social Setting&#13;
1.1    During the 1980s, the economy of the Dominican Republic suffered serious internal and&#13;
external imbalances. The economic trough occurred during the 1990-1991 recession when GDP&#13;
declined by 6.8 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Social spending levels, already inadequate,&#13;
reached a low point at the same time. To reverse the trend, the Government initiated a&#13;
comprehensive stabilization program in 1990, the New Economic Plan. By 1993 significant&#13;
advances toward macroeconomic stability were achieved: inflation declined from 60 percent to&#13;
4.8 percent and international reserves increased from a minus US$198 millions to US$438&#13;
millions, accompanied by a reduction in the debt to GDP ratio.&#13;
1.2   Inadequate expenditure in the social sectors is reflected in key educational and&#13;
employment statistics: the average entrant on the labor force has completed only four years of&#13;
school; 20 percent of the adult population is illiterate, and, despite minimal barriers to labor&#13;
market entry, and a lack of strong unionization, formal sector unemployment is high, at about 25&#13;
percent in 1994. Levels of education and salaries for unskilled and semi-skilled workers are&#13;
among the lowest in the Caribbean. Low average basic educational attainment and productivity&#13;
also contribute to underemployment in the informal sector, accounting for 22 percent of the labor&#13;
force, and to a high degree of income inequality. The wealthiest 20 percent of the population&#13;
captures over half, and the poorest 20 percent only 4 percent of total income. Some 20 percent of&#13;
the population is estimated to be poor.&#13;
B. The Education Sector&#13;
1.3   During 1982-91, public expenditure on education as a share of GDP fell from 1.9 to 0.9&#13;
percent. Insufficient financing spurred severe deterioration in the basic education system'.&#13;
Meager salary and non-salary incentives led to teacher absenteeism, strikes, and the loss of&#13;
formally qualified teachers to other professions. The number of applicants to the country's&#13;
teacher training schools dropped from 2,400 in 1986 to less than 600 in 1991; and, in 1992, 15&#13;
percent of practicing teachers were untrained secondary school graduates hired to fill the gap.&#13;
Facilities development and maintenance, as well as provision of student and teacher learning&#13;
materials, also lagged far behind needs; heavy centralization and insufficient management capacity&#13;
within the Secretariat of Education and Arts (SEEBAC) exacerbated the problems. (Annex 1&#13;
describes the organizational and management structure in the education sector).&#13;
1.4   The impact of neglect on the coverage, quality and efficiency of basic education was&#13;
severe. In 1991, only 16 percent of five-year olds were enrolled in public preschool classes, the&#13;
majority housed in public primary schools lacking the requisite space and materials. An estimated&#13;
The basic edcation system in the Dominican Republic comprises I year of preschool, the primary cycle (grades I - 6), and the lower secondary&#13;
cycle (grades 7 - 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
90 percent of the relevant age-group was enrolled in primary schools; this group was equally&#13;
divided between girls and boys. However, only half of approximately 950,000 children enrolled in&#13;
public primary schools, could expect to complete the primary cycle. Less than 25 percent could&#13;
expect to complete grade 8, the final year of basic education. Some 10 percent of children in the&#13;
age group 7 to 12 never attended school and annual repetition and dropout reached 18 and 16&#13;
percent, respectively, in 1991. (Annex 1). The lowest participation and completion rates were&#13;
found among that 65 percent of the population living in rural and peni-urban areas. Private,&#13;
mainly urban schools, which account for about 20 percent of students enrolled at the primary and&#13;
30 percent of students at the lower secondary levels, increased enrollments as a response to the&#13;
crisis in the public sector. However, many of these schools, which serve lower income students,&#13;
were equally constrained in terms of resources available to offer education of acceptable quality.&#13;
C. Education Sector Reform&#13;
1.5    Recognizing the high costs of neglect of human capital formation, Government and civil&#13;
society moved together to give priority to resolving social sector issues in recent years. In 1989-&#13;
90 civil society initiated a series of actions aimed at addressing pressing problems, focusing on&#13;
education. These actions progressed from protests, through dialogue, to consensus, crystallizing&#13;
in the Plan Decenal de Educaci6n (Ten-Year Education Plan)2. The Government, supported&#13;
closely by the UNDP, formalized the Plan in 1990.&#13;
1.6    The Ten-Year Education Plan (1991-2000) aims to expand service coverage, raise student&#13;
achievement levels, and strengthen sector management. Included are specific objectives to: (a)&#13;
increase public spending (including teachers' salaries) on basic education; (b) promote a set of&#13;
national education standards through curriculum reform and an assessment system; (c) provide,&#13;
systematically, appropriate educational materials and teacher and administrator training, both pre-&#13;
and in-service; (d) strengthen the SEEBAC by deconcentrating resources and responsibilities and&#13;
improving information systems; and (e) stimulate community participation in school development&#13;
and management. To support the execution of the first phase of the Plan, the Emergency Phase,&#13;
the IDB approved a loan in 1991 (US$29 million), in parallel with a complementary loan extended&#13;
by the IBRD (Loan 3351-DO, US$15 million). Both institutions plan follow-up operations to&#13;
support the implementation of the Plan's second phase.&#13;
D. Plan Achievements and Innovations&#13;
1.7    The Plan's implementation achievements to date have surpassed expectations. The&#13;
Government has more than doubled basic education spending since 1991. As expenditures increased,&#13;
enrollments rose (See Figure 1 below). The SEEBAC reports that enrollment in grades 1 to 8 climbed&#13;
9 percent during 1991-94, and repetition and dropout rates declined to 13 and I 1 percent, respectively,&#13;
between 1991-94. Overall completion rates at the primary level rose to 60 percent.&#13;
2  The development ofthe Ten Year Plan and its execution have incorporated broad individual and institutional participation (some 50,000&#13;
individuals and over 100 institutions) in a process of consultation among sector stakeholders, including the business community, NGOs, the&#13;
teachers' union and major political parties.&#13;

1.8   In line with specific Plan objectives, a revised curriculum, which focuses on participatory&#13;
techniques in the classroom, was completed during 1994. Based on anticipated content of the revised&#13;
curriculum, about half of teachers in grades 1-8 received or are receiving six months of upgradirg.&#13;
Transitional textbooks and workbooks were also provided for all public school students and a national&#13;
assessment system introduced. Some 20 percent of primary classrooms, nearly 5,000, were also&#13;
improved or replaced. In addition, SEEBAC staff participated in initial training for deconcentrating&#13;
management, and parents associations (PAs) were established or strengthened at all primary schools.&#13;
The PAs assisted with materials distribution, routine maintenance and, in rural areas, a school nutrition&#13;
program.&#13;
1.9   The move toward increased expenditure on basic education represents an important&#13;
achievement under the Plan. This trend, reflected largely in improved teacher incentives, together with&#13;
other innovations in the areas of curriculum development, sales of materials, student assessment and&#13;
community participation, stand out as notable achievements of the first phase of the Plan.&#13;
1.10  Teacher Incentives. Teacher and administrator salary increases largely explain the increase in&#13;
public expenditure as a share of GDP from 0.9 percent to 1.9 percent during 1991-94. In view of&#13;
requirements for fiscal discipline, the Government agreed with the principal teachers union to a salary&#13;
structure which maintains a low base, averaging about US$1,000 per year, while providing a series of&#13;
bonuses which can triple pay. The bonuses are structured to serve as incentives, and include: an&#13;
increment between 7 and 32 percent of base salary tied to performance, between 10 and 40 percent&#13;
based on in-service upgrading received, and 20 to 25 percent for working in economically depressed&#13;
areas. Increases in base salary during 1991-95 resulted in a doubling of average teacher salary to about&#13;
US$2,600 including bonuses, by early 1995. This amount represents nearly four times the minimum&#13;
wage, and some 60 percent of the Central Bank's "Basket of Average Consumption" for a family of&#13;
four. The improved pay, together with the related opportunities for training, have reduced annual&#13;
attrition from the teaching force from 5 to 3 percent and boosted intake of preservice trainees to over&#13;
2,000 per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
1.11   Curriculum Development. A new curriculum, developed independently of IDB and IBRD&#13;
project support, will be introduced gradually beginning in the school year 1995-96. It incorporated&#13;
broad involvement of national stakeholders from the education sector and civil society. It will replace a&#13;
highly mechanistic, teacher-centered curriculum, focusing, instead, on the teacher as facilitator. It is&#13;
designed to promote inquiry and interaction among students and is flexible enough to be adapted to&#13;
regional and local circumstances to promote equity in educational opportunity. Parental involvement is&#13;
also encouraged. The revised curriculum forms the centerpiece for the further strengthening of basic&#13;
education under the second phase of the Ten-Year Plan. Other educational inputs are designed to&#13;
support its successful introduction.&#13;
1.12  Sales of Materials. Under the Plan, the SEEBAC provided low-cost textbooks and student&#13;
workbooks for students in grades 1-8 attending public schools. In line with basic education policy,&#13;
textbooks are lent to students in the public sector and workbooks are sold at cost. In an innovative&#13;
move to defray charges for students unable to afford the associated costs, and to establish regular&#13;
income to cover a share of costs for basic and complementary materials production, the SEEBAC&#13;
began selling its new materials to the private sector in 1993. In 1994 it earned some US$2.5 million&#13;
from these sales.&#13;
1.13   National Student Assessment. The establishment of the national student assessment system&#13;
was another notable achievement of the first phase of Plan implementation. The examination, which is&#13;
administered to all students in grades 4 and 8 in both public and private schools, was developed largely&#13;
during 1991, using local resources. An extensive infrastructure bolsters the system: a central&#13;
committee selects examination items from questions submitted by teachers; a private firm prints and&#13;
seals the examinations, and SEEBAC district staff distribute the examinations, which are proctored by&#13;
committees of parents and teachers. The distribution of results allows administrators, teachers, and&#13;
parents to assess leaming outcomes for students, schools, and geographical areas. The system&#13;
measured achievement of grade 4 and 8 students in 1994, with about 30 percent of those examined&#13;
attending private schools. The assessment is widely supported by educators and parents as a useful&#13;
tool for disceming needs and promoting improvements in educational quality and student achievement.&#13;
1.14 Community Participation. The Ten-Year Plan gives emphasis to strengthening community&#13;
participation as a vehicle to improve educational equity and efficiency. Supported by the IDB and&#13;
IBRD-assisted operations, SEEBAC began by establishing and providing initial training to PAs in all&#13;
public schools. Authority to manage discretionary school funds and participate in limited decision-&#13;
making and evaluation was also delegated to PAs. PAs identified requirements and administered funds&#13;
for school rehabilitation and preventive maintenance, in some cases also providing labor. They also&#13;
managed a rural school feeding program, assisted with the distribution of learning materials, and, on a&#13;
pilot basis, monitored teacher and student attendance.&#13;
1.15  Based on results of a 1995 study carried out during preparation for the second phase of Plan&#13;
activities and related IDB and IBRD support, the impact of the increased participation by parents has&#13;
been positive and should be further encouraged and strengthened. The study incorporated focus group&#13;
interviews, school visits, and surveys in four regions. On average, PAs meet four times a year. Two-&#13;
thirds of attendees, averaging 125 parents per school, are women, while middle-income men with&#13;
secondary and post-secondary qualifications tend to assume leadership roles. Administrators,&#13;
educators, and parents agree that parental involvement has a positive effect on student performance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
attendance. They further agree that educators should retain authority for pedagogical content and&#13;
delivery.&#13;
E. Lessons of Experience&#13;
1.16  The experience gathered during the implementation of the first phase of the Ten-Year Plan, and&#13;
from the mid-term project reviews completed by the IDB and the IBRD in Januaiy 1995, highlight&#13;
several important lessons. These have guided design of the proposed project and center on: the&#13;
importance of broad consensus among Plan stakeholders, the need to consolidate and transfer Plan&#13;
management and related skills increasingly to the SEEBAC, and the need to ensure adequate financing&#13;
for basic education. Specific technical and sector-related lessons are also incorporated in proposed&#13;
project design. (Annex 2 provides an overview of lessons of experience under the current and earlier&#13;
IBRD-assisted education projects.)&#13;
1.17  Role of Project Stakeholders. Persistent and broad support by stakeholders in the education&#13;
sector accounts in large part for the successful implementation of Plan reforms. Strong public sector&#13;
commnitment, bolstered by a period of political and economic stability, represented a direct response to&#13;
the broader society's perceived need to strengthen basic education in the Dominican Republic. In&#13;
designing the proposed follow-up operations, an effort was made to incorporate the framework for&#13;
further and more systematic involvement of civil society, in particular in the monitoring of Plan results,&#13;
to enhance consensus-building and ensure adequate and effective public expenditure and sustainability.&#13;
1.18  Program Management and Coordination. The IDB and IBRD-assisted projects&#13;
represented a significant share of Plan activities and investment expenditures during 1991-95; and&#13;
competent project coordinating units contributed substantially to successful implementation.&#13;
Recognizing weaknesses in SEEBAC management capacity, the two project coordination units were&#13;
established to support the transfer of management skills to the SEEBAC while not relying directly on&#13;
its management skills for project execution. They were supported by strong leadership from the Office&#13;
of the Secretary, SEEBAC, local IDB staff and the UNDP, which is executing the IBRD loan.&#13;
Outcomes of the project management arrangements are in line with experience elsewhere: project&#13;
implementation has depended heavily on the coordination units. While substantial transfer of&#13;
management experience and skills to the SEEBAC has been achieved, sustainability will require a&#13;
further build-up of SEEBAC management capacity --at the central, regional and district levels.&#13;
Further, to ensure coordination and avoid duplication of effort, a single coordination authority is&#13;
needed. The proposed operations will thus be coordinated by a single unit which would support and&#13;
draw increasingly on regular SEEBAC managers and staff for decision-making and implementation&#13;
management.&#13;
1.19 Reliability of Expenditure. The recent rate of growth in total public spending on education has&#13;
outpaced the growth in GDP. The trend toward increased public expenditure on education, led by&#13;
teacher remuneration, is positive. However, some 30 percent of expenditure over the past three&#13;
years is attributable to allocations from a discretionary fund managed by the Presidency; and 90&#13;
percent of this fund is allocated for construction of schools on an ad hoc basis. This off-budget&#13;
funding needs to be institutionalized to provide a stable foundation for effective sectoral planning&#13;
and expenditure. It is, however, expected that the priority given to allocations for education, and&#13;
the social sectors more generally, would continue over the foreseeable future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
1.20  Component Effectiveness. Achievements in raising quality and efficiency of education&#13;
under the Plan are evident in the gains in reducing student repetition rates and increasing the&#13;
completion rate for basic education (para. 1.7). These outcomes generally confirm the&#13;
effectiveness of expenditure inputs under the Plan. The centrally provided inputs (e.g. materials,&#13;
teacher training and improved salaries, improved facilities and nutrition) have been complemented&#13;
by the important input of parent associations. This input at the school level, together with&#13;
widespread provision of results of the student assessment, is judged to provide added stimulus for&#13;
strengthened planning are accountability at the school level. In other areas, lessons confirm the&#13;
need for additional inputs. In particular, initial outcomes highlighted the need to incorporate&#13;
appropriate curriculum, didactic materials and school facilities to meet the special needs of&#13;
preschool education and multigrade classrooms. In line with Plan objectives to improve children's&#13;
readiness for primary school, an initial expansion of preschool places, from 29,000 to 54,000 five-&#13;
year olds (27 percent of the relevant population) was undertaken during 1991-94. However,&#13;
accompanying accommodations in existing facilities, teacher preparation and supporting materials&#13;
were not provided. Similarly, while a third of all primary schools, mainly small and located in&#13;
rural areas and peri-urban areas, cater to two or more grades within the same classroom, requisite&#13;
supporting inputs for effective teaching were neither developed nor introduced. Now identified,&#13;
these needs will be met during the second phase of Plan execution.&#13;
1.21  Private Schools for Low-income Students. The lessons of experience also suggest the&#13;
advisability of strengthening private as well as public schools in the effort to improve basic&#13;
education. Over 1,500 private primary and lower secondary schools operate in urban areas. The&#13;
majority of these schools serve low-income, urban areas. Growth in private school enrollments,&#13;
based on demand and parents' willingness to pay, helped to maintain the relatively high enrollment&#13;
ratio in basic education, around 90 percent, throughout the 1985-91 crisis in the public sector.&#13;
Some 750 private institutions are accredited by the SEEBAC and participate in Plan activities,&#13;
including teacher training and purchase of learning materials. These schools operate at a level of&#13;
quality comparable to, or slightly better than, public schools: 1994 results of the new national&#13;
assessment show scores of 71 percent and 63 percent for grade four and eight students,&#13;
respectively, in public schools and scores of 76 and 74 percent for children in the same grades in&#13;
private schools. However, nearly 800 private schools do not meet accreditation standards,&#13;
lacking trained teachers and other inputs, and an unknown number of small schools operate&#13;
informally in areas lacking public and recognized private schools. Improved information on these&#13;
unaccredited and informal schools, collected during Plan implementation, suggests that they&#13;
represent a cost-effective means to expand and upgrade basic education, in particular to better&#13;
serve rapidly expanding peri-urban populations. As a result, mechanisms to channel support to&#13;
these schools would be developed during the second phase of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
F. Key Remaining Issues in Basic Education&#13;
1.22   Despite the successful implementation of the initial phase of the Ten-Year Education Plan,&#13;
educational equity, quality and efficiency remain comparatively low. Further effort, to consolidate&#13;
and deepen achievements, is required under the second phase of the Plan to overcome continuing&#13;
deficiencies in educational effectiveness and management.&#13;
Educational Effectiveness&#13;
1.23   Conclusions on student achievement based on the new assessment system are premature&#13;
owing primarily to a lack of baseline data and initial weaknesses in examination design.&#13;
Notwithstanding recent improvements in coverage and efficiency indicators, however, the average&#13;
quality and efficiency of basic education in both public and private schools in the Dominican&#13;
Republic remain low. Educational inputs designed to strengthen outcomes of basic education are&#13;
still in transition and require further development and consolidation, notably in the areas of&#13;
curriculum, materials and teacher support. Problems of poor student nutrition and inadequate&#13;
school infrastructure also persist.&#13;
Curriculum and Educational Materials&#13;
1.24   The new curriculum (para. 1.11) represents a significant change from the highly traditional&#13;
curriculum it replaces. In line with experience gained under the Plan, it also includes, for the first&#13;
time, a program for the preschool year which emphasizes preschool and socialization skills to&#13;
prepare students for the first grade. The curriculum changes will need to be broadly disseminated&#13;
and incorporated in both student and teacher materials, and in teacher training, during the Plan's&#13;
second phase.&#13;
1.25   The transitional materials provided under the Plan were generally of good educational&#13;
quality. Each public-school student received textbooks and accompanying workbooks for&#13;
Spanish, social studies, mathematics, and science. The materials were developed by the SEEBAC&#13;
using local authors. Complementary classroom and school materials (e.g., maps, subject-related&#13;
posters, and other supplies) were also provided. Despite distribution of materials through an&#13;
independent public enterprise, delivery of materials suffered delay: some 5 percent of students&#13;
were not issued textbooks in 1994 owing to lack of clarity over procedures for collecting fees or&#13;
exempting students unable to pay (para. 1.12).&#13;
1.26  In order to support the introduction of the new curriculum, modifications in both teacher&#13;
and student materials, and new materials for preschool, will be required during the second phase&#13;
of Plan implementation. A permanent capacity, including sufficient qualified personnel, is also&#13;
needed within the SEEBAC to manage development and piloting of revised and new materials. 3&#13;
The systems for distribution and fee collection for educational materials also needs to be&#13;
improved, to ensure timely delivery to all teachers and students. In addition, small school libraries&#13;
3 The Government agreed to create a materials fund (Fondo Editorial) under the IDB's ongoing loan operation but has not yet institutionalized&#13;
this finction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
and complementary materials and supplies are needed, especially for rural and peri-urban schools&#13;
where students often lack access to reading materials other than basic textbooks.&#13;
Teacher Support and Availability&#13;
1.27  Longstanding problems with teacher and teaching effectiveness in the Dominican Republic&#13;
stem largely from past curriculum rigidities and inadequate incentives. Recent improvements in&#13;
these areas will require parallel changes in teacher training and supervision, and increased teaching&#13;
hours. Anticipated increases in enrollments will also require a substantial increase in the supply of&#13;
teachers for the remainder of Plan implementation and beyond.&#13;
1.28  Teacher Training. The formal requirement for qualifying as a teacher at the primary or&#13;
lower secondary level is completion of a secondary-level program at a normal school. About&#13;
7,500 primary school teachers lacked this minimum qualification in 1992; and the content of the&#13;
normal school program is poorly suited to the objectives of updated curricula through grade 8.&#13;
As a result, most teachers lack both subject matter knowledge and the pedagogical skills needed&#13;
for effective interaction with students and appropriate use of related educational materials. Under&#13;
the Ten-Year Plan, the SEEBAC thus introduced a post-secondary teaching certificate as the new&#13;
minimum standard for teacher training for basic education. Nearly 45 percent of practicing&#13;
teachers, about 13,000, will have completed this 72 credit program, offered through extension&#13;
services of local universities, by the end of 1995. The SEEBAC also provided training to upgrade&#13;
the qualifications of 5,000 teachers lacking the normal school qualification or equivalent. Both&#13;
programs were assessed favorably by participating teachers, who report they are using knowledge&#13;
and techniques imparted through the training. During the implementation of the second phase of&#13;
the Plan, all current teachers would complete the new certificate program. The training would&#13;
need to incorporate additional, specialized programs for preschool and multigrade teachers&#13;
(para. 1.20). The SEEBAC will also need about 4,000 additional preschool through grade 8&#13;
teachers by 2006 to meet objectives for enrollment and completion rates in basic education, while&#13;
maintaining the current teacher-student ratio. (Overall public enrollments in preschool through&#13;
grade 8 are projected to increase from the current 1.28 million to 1.52 by 2005). Each new&#13;
teacher will need to complete the new minimum qualification. The six normal schools which&#13;
currently provide pre-service training lack the capacity to meet that demand. The SEEBAC will&#13;
need to expand its links with qualified providers of training, mainly universities, to design and&#13;
deliver the required training, both pre- and in-service.&#13;
1.29  Supervision. In 1992 most supervisors were transferred from regional to district offices&#13;
and provided motorcycles to facilitate school visits. However, technical support for teachers at&#13;
the school and classroom levels is still limited. Teachers participating in the SEEBAC's in-service&#13;
training report high satisfaction with on-the-job supervision and support provided as part of the&#13;
training. Supervisors will need to replicate this model to support continuing improvements in&#13;
teacher performance. In addition, isolated rural schools are still neglected by supervisors, relative&#13;
to their urban counterparts, notably the 3,000 rural teachers involved in multigrade teaching. To&#13;
overcome this imbalance, the SEEBAC is increasing district staff and infrastructure, selectively.&#13;
Incorporation of school directors and community members in the process will also need to be&#13;
explored and pursued.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1.30  Classroom Hours and Attendance. The 684 hours of official in-class instruction per&#13;
school year in the Dominican Republic compares unfavorably with the 1,080 hours offered in&#13;
Guatemala, 1,040 in El Salvador, and 999 in Costa Rica. Classes are offered during two 3.75&#13;
hour shifts, with students participating either in the morning or afternoon. Over half of teachers&#13;
work both shifts: the teacher-student ratio averages I to 36 in the morning shift and 1 to 25 in the&#13;
afternoon, both satisfactory. In light of budget considerations, the SEEBAC has elected to delay&#13;
consideration of expanding the official length of the school day, which could preclude the teaching&#13;
of two shifts by the same teacher. Instead, its second phase Plan efforts would focus on&#13;
increasing the efficiency and quality of the class time currently available while establishing the&#13;
human and institutional resources necessary to extend the schools day for the period beyond&#13;
2000. The SEEBAC will, however, conclude already-initiated negotiations with the teachers&#13;
union to extend the school calendar an extra month while maintaining the current length of the&#13;
school day, providing students with about 70 hours of additional class time in the near-term.&#13;
1.31   Absenteeism among teachers dropped sharply with the recent provision of improved pay,&#13;
teaching materials, and in-service training. In addition, monitoring by selected PAs contributed to&#13;
increased teacher attendance. However, teacher and student absenteeism continue to reduce&#13;
effective class time during the school year. One teacher in five surveyed in 1995 reports frequent&#13;
absences or late arrival to school. The problem is especially acute in rural areas. The principal&#13;
reason appears to be distance from school: almost half of teachers surveyed live in a different&#13;
community than that in which they work. While reporting mechanisms are not fully developed,&#13;
school visits revealed that the rate of student absenteeism runs at about 10 percent, due to&#13;
distance from school, illness, and family employment obligations. In view of the shortfall in class&#13;
hours, continued effort to improve teacher incentives, and to increase monitoring of attendance of&#13;
teachers and students are warranted.&#13;
The National Assessment&#13;
1.32  The student assessment system introduced under the Plan requires adaptation to the new&#13;
curriculum. Refinement is needed to match question content with desired curriculum outcomes,&#13;
and to measure particular skills. The SEEBAC also needs to ensure that the assessment does not&#13;
discriminate against particular groups or lead teachers to focus on preparing students for the&#13;
assessment at the expense of key curriculum objectives: the examination is being used as a&#13;
determinant of promotion at grades 4 and 8. A danger exists that its use at grade 8, in particular,&#13;
could deter students from entering upper secondary school (grades 9-12). Use of the assessment&#13;
for promotion purposes thus needs to be carefully evaluated. Finally, the annual execution of the&#13;
assessment absorbs considerable teacher and administrator time. The contracting of all&#13;
administrative responsibilities to a private firm would increase costs dramatically, since much of&#13;
the testing apparatus at the school level depends upon donated labor from teachers and parents.&#13;
The recent establishment of a small, permanent staff within the SEEBAC, capable of hiring&#13;
consultants and contractors at rates more attractive than regular civil service salaries, provides a&#13;
reasonable compromise and should allow the SEEBAC to manage the assessment system more&#13;
efficiently over the long-term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
School Nutrition&#13;
1.33  According to a 1994 SEEBAC study, as many as 27 percent of students suffer from&#13;
stunted growth, I in 5 suffers from anemia, I in 4 from vitamin A deficiency, and half from iodine&#13;
deficiency. Rates of malnutrition are highest in the poorer areas of the country: along the Haitian&#13;
border, in peri-urban zones and in isolated rural communities. The SEEBAC, currently supported&#13;
by the European Community and the World Food Programme, manages a school feeding program&#13;
for about 80,000 primary school children along the Haitian border; meals are prepared by parents.&#13;
The Plan, also initiated an urban nutritional supplementation program for 100,000 students. This&#13;
comprises distribution of a school snack--fortified milk and locally manufactured biscuits.&#13;
School-based deparatisation is currently being piloted. Some interventions have not proceeded as&#13;
rapidly as planned under the Ten-Year Plan, including a school nutrition information and&#13;
education program. To contribute to improved student achievement and attendance, the existing&#13;
and new efforts will require expansion and careful monitoring and evaluation to ensure proper&#13;
targeting and cost-effectiveness. SEEBAC district staff supporting school nutrition also require&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
1.34  School Facilities. In 1990, the SEEBAC classified 30 percent of its 21,000 classrooms&#13;
used for basic education as requiring only preventive maintenance, while half required minor&#13;
rehabilitation work, and 20 percent needed complete replacement or major rehabilitation. During&#13;
the last five years the Government, with both its own resources and those provided through&#13;
international agencies, rehabilitated 2,700 classrooms; and replaced or heavily rehabilitated about&#13;
2,200. As a result, about 60 percent of all classrooms now require periodic maintenance, 30&#13;
percent need minor rehabilitation, and another 20 percent need replacement or reconstruction.&#13;
The Presidential Fund financed most of the classroom replacement and major rehabilitation. The&#13;
SEEBAC used IDB and IBRD loan financing to undertake minor rehabilitation and to initiate&#13;
preventative maintenance, covering 15 percent of the total need. The IDB and IBRD programs&#13;
for minor rehabilitation and maintenance have both featured decentralized resource allocation and&#13;
PA management of related funds. Materials and independent supervision are provided by the&#13;
SEEBAC. For routine maintenance, labor is provided by the PAs while minor rehabilitation is&#13;
contracted by the PAs.&#13;
1.35  According to the SEEBAC's 1995 national school inventory, an average of 61 students&#13;
use each classroom per school day in two shifts, which is satisfactory. However, half of schools&#13;
offering preschool services lack appropriate classroom space, often occupying part of a classroom&#13;
in use by a primary school class. In addition, the SEEBAC estimates that overcrowding will&#13;
become acute over the next five years, owing to planned expansion of preschool classes, growth&#13;
of the school age population, demographic shifts to peri-urban areas, and improved completion&#13;
rates for basic education. In light of these pressures, the SEEBAC estimates that it will need to&#13;
construct 2,600 new classrooms between 1995 and 2000, an increase of 12 percent, complete the&#13;
rehabilitation of existing classrooms and institutionalize regular maintenance and minor&#13;
rehabilitation, incorporating the PAs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Management Effectiveness&#13;
1.36  Despite selective improvements in SEEBAC's management structure and capacity under&#13;
the Plan, problems of heavy-centralization, poorly qualified staff and incomplete communications&#13;
and information continue to detract from management effectiveness. Enhanced community&#13;
participation shows potential for improving accountability at the school level, but will require&#13;
further development.&#13;
1.37  Structure and Responsibilities. Under the Plan, the SEEBAC took steps to devolve&#13;
responsibilities for school and teacher supervision to regional and district offices and&#13;
administration of school maintenance resources to those regions and districts participating in the&#13;
IDB and IBRD-supported projects. Nevertheless, the majority of administrative and resource&#13;
allocation decisions remain with the central SEEBAC, and, for capital spending, the President's&#13;
office. Sub-national SEEBAC offices and schools lack the human and financial resources and the&#13;
administrative mandate to respond to local initiatives.&#13;
1.38  Through a consensus-oriented process involving representatives of the teachers union,&#13;
opposition parties, and civil society, the SEEBAC submitted to Congress in April 1995 a&#13;
proposed Education Law, intended to establish the framework for deconcentrated management.&#13;
Annex 3 provides a summary of the proposed framework, within which (a) day-to-day&#13;
management and investment decisions would be devolved downwards, (b) planning,&#13;
programming, and budgeting would flow from bottom-up, and (c) standards, monitoring, and&#13;
financing would be provided from top-down. Congressional approval of the proposed law&#13;
remains to be determined. Irrespective of the outcome, the SEEBAC has launched a gradual&#13;
process of deconcentration. Further progress will require additional planning, training, and&#13;
equipment, as well as further study and preparation. Particular emphasis needs to be placed on&#13;
improved systems and procedures for programming and budgeting. Apart from the proposed&#13;
Law, a National Consultative Council for Education has been convened. This council, with broad&#13;
representation, would monitor sector targets to leam from experience and advise the SEEBAC&#13;
regarding possibilities for improvements and corrections.&#13;
1.39  Administrative Staff. The SEEBAC has initiated training for administrators, focusing&#13;
on supervisors and school directors, as well as central staff, under the Ten-Year Plan. A masters&#13;
degree program is currently being provided for 100 middle-level administrators, and some 400&#13;
regional and district staff have participated in short seminars. However, this training has been&#13;
insufficient to support system-wide improvements, especially to clarify responsibilities and reduce&#13;
duplication of effort between the central and lower administrative levels in the early stages of&#13;
deconcentration. The SEEBAC plans to overcome these deficiencies by delineating staff&#13;
responsibilities and providing related management training on a regular basis. It is also&#13;
considering establishment of a number of small, semi-automous agencies responsible for many key&#13;
functions. These entities, which would report to the Secretary, SEEBAC, would incorporate&#13;
rather than duplicate SEEBAC functions, e.g. for management of in-service training. They would&#13;
be able to compensate a small but highly qualified group of staff at higher than regular civil&#13;
service salaries. Currently, only the Institute for School Nutrition and Health (INDOFANE), has&#13;
been formally created, while a national textbook authority (para. 1.26) awaits approval.&#13;
Informally, the SEEBAC's National Assessment Division is operating along the proposed lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Other semi-autonomous entities would be considered should the proposed Education Law be&#13;
approved.&#13;
1.40 Management Information System (MIS). A new MIS, featuring some 40 sub-systems,&#13;
currently links the central SEEBAC and most of its regional and district offices. To introduce the&#13;
system, the SEEBAC provided all regional and some district offices with computers. Of note are:&#13;
an educational statistics system; a new payroll management system, which delivers paychecks to&#13;
teachers and administrators on time, eliminating a lag of two to three months; a system to track&#13;
students, not yet fully developed; and a school mapping system, which assesses schools' physical&#13;
needs in light of demographic trends, location, and building condition. A subsystem to monitor&#13;
student achievement, promotion, repetition, and dropout, based on the national assessment, is also&#13;
being developed.&#13;
1.41  Despite these achievements, the MIS requires further development in several key areas:&#13;
geographical coverage, integration, and applicability to the daily tasks of administrators. The&#13;
coverage of the system is incomplete; not all district offices are integrated into the MIS, leaving&#13;
the SEEBAC poorly informed about the isolated rural and peri-urban schools it most needs to&#13;
assist. Integration across sub-systems is poor, reducing usefulness, and information is not&#13;
accessible to administrators lacking computers and computer training. Improvement of the&#13;
coverage and relevance of the MIS would require investments in technical assistance, hardware&#13;
and software, and the incentives to use them above the school level. It would also require&#13;
simplification and improved means of communication for use at the school level.&#13;
1.42 Community Participation. The Ten-Year Plan emphasizes the importance of community&#13;
participation as a means to strengthen educational services and accountability. To this end, the&#13;
SEEBAC has supported the formation of PAs, expanded their responsibilities, and given them the&#13;
authority to manage public funds. It is expected that increased mobilization of PA support would&#13;
lead to participation in school planning and financial management activities, as well as enhanced&#13;
parental support for children's education outside of the classroom and increased support by&#13;
NGOs, municipal governments, churches, and the business community. To date, however, the&#13;
extent of PA involvement has been limited largely to participation in management of school&#13;
maintenance, assistance with the distribution of materials and, in the rural areas, assistance with&#13;
school feeding. To increase PAs contributions to school planning and management will require&#13;
increased support and preparation as well as SEEBAC's willingness to enhance responsibilities.&#13;
In particular, training to encourage more active women's participation needs to be provided. A&#13;
clarification of desired areas of involvement, e.g., expansion of the pilot to monitor teacher and&#13;
student attendance, as well as systematic support and preparation of PAs will be required in the&#13;
next phase of development. SEEBAC's district community participation facilitators, currently&#13;
serving as many as 100 schools each, will need to be increased and prepared to support the&#13;
process.&#13;
G. Government Strategy for Basic Education&#13;
1.43  Through the Consolidation Phase of the Ten-Year Education Plan the SEEBAC plans to&#13;
pursue its coverage, quality, and efficiency objectives for basic education during 1996-2000. This&#13;
second phase of the Plan will entail: (a) increasing public spending on basic education, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
raising education allocations as a share of government spending to match the 1970 rate of 16&#13;
percent, augmenting public education spending as a portion of GDP to the 1970 level of 2.9&#13;
percent., and raising the 1995 rate of recurrent expenditure on basic education from US$102 per&#13;
student to US$124 by the year 2000; (b) further improving educators' economic and professional&#13;
standing by providing in-service training opportunities and increasing the average teacher's pay&#13;
from US$2,600 (60 percent of the Central Bank's "Basket of Average Consumption") to&#13;
US$3,400 (80 percent of the Basket) by 2000, based on incentives for training, experience,&#13;
performance, and work in economically depressed areas; (c) enriching effectiveness in the&#13;
classroom, through curriculum reform, universal distribution of learning materials, expanding&#13;
preschool and nutrition services, and upgrading school facilities, (d) strengthening the SEEBAC's&#13;
management capacity and responsiveness to local needs through training, better information&#13;
management, and deconcentrating resources and decision-making responsibilities to regions,&#13;
districts and schools, and (e) expanding parental support for their children's education and&#13;
involvement in school management. (This strategy is embodied in Plan documents as listed in&#13;
Annex 1 1).&#13;
,1. Rationale for IBRD and IDB Involvement&#13;
1.44   Consistent with both the World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for the&#13;
Dominican Republic, discussed by the IBRD's Executive Directors on May 2, 1995, and the&#13;
Assistance Strategy set forward by the Inter-American Development Bank, the Government&#13;
recognizes that continued improvement of social services in general,4 and basic education services&#13;
in particular, is essential for laying a sound foundation for social stability, sustained economic&#13;
growth, and the alleviation of poverty.&#13;
1.45   In view of both banks' support of the first phase of the Ten-Year Plan and their&#13;
experiences elsewhere in the basic education subsector, the Government has requested the&#13;
support of both institutions for the Plan's second phase. Given that the proposed project would&#13;
account for less than 15 percent of the Government's planned expenditures in the education&#13;
sector from 1996 to 2000), the particular value-added of the banks' further participation would lie&#13;
in the consolidation of policy and plan implementation efforts, with a focus on assuring adequate&#13;
educational quality, overall sub-sector efficiency, and improved monitoring and evaluation in the&#13;
future.&#13;
4   Support has also been provided for other social sectors. Efforts to institute a social investment fund gained momentum in 1993 and 1994, and&#13;
the IDB approved a related loan, in November 1994. Upon the signing in 1994 by the Government, NGOs, and 16 political parties of a poverty&#13;
reduction agenda, the Reforma Social y Combate a la Pobreza, the Government petitioned the lDB, World Bank, UNDP, and Pan American&#13;
Health Organization to assist it in the preparation of a health sector reform grounded in wide stakeholder participation. The reform would&#13;
reconfigure the social security and public health systems, promote integration of public and private services, introduce alternative financing&#13;
mechanisms for service delivery, and reallocate health expenditures to preventive and primary care for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
2.1   The proposed Basic Education Development Project would support a share of the&#13;
Government's development and investment program for basic education for the period 1996-&#13;
2000, as reflected in its basic education strategy. Objectives would be to: (a) improve the quality&#13;
of basic education; (b) increase enrollment and especially completion rates, with priority directed&#13;
to children from low income families; and (c) strengthen technical and resource management&#13;
capabilities for basic education. The first two objectives would be pursued through an&#13;
educational development component and the third, through a management development&#13;
component. Critical targets for reaching objectives are set forth in monitoring and evaluation&#13;
indicators for the Plan (para. 2.24 and Annex 4).&#13;
B. Project Targeting&#13;
2.2   The proposed project would benefit all students attending public schools offering basic&#13;
education services. However, several components would be targeted to children from low-&#13;
income families in areas currently least-well served, i.e., in peri-urban and rural areas. The&#13;
targeted districts have been identified through a national nutrition census (supported under the&#13;
current IBRD loan) and income data obtained through a 1994 poverty study (prepared by the&#13;
IDB). Information provided through the 1995 physical plant census complements these studies for&#13;
the facilities subcomponents. The targeting criteria and procedures would be incorporated in&#13;
detail for each relevant subcomponent in the operations manual under preparation for the project,&#13;
which would be completed as a requirement for loan effectiveness. Targeted subcomponents and&#13;
related selection criteria are:&#13;
(a)   provision of school supplies and expansion of preschool education places for&#13;
children in the poorest half of districts, measured by average income (paras. 2.7c&#13;
and 2.13);&#13;
(b)   provision of complementary school materials for all multigrade schools (typically&#13;
located in poor communities) (para 2.7 c);&#13;
(c)   expansion of the school-feeding programs along the Haitian border and in marginal&#13;
urban areas, based primarily on updated data on nutrition status of children,&#13;
complemented by income data (para 2.1 11);&#13;
(d)   expansion and improvement of school facilities in the 40 percent poorest districts&#13;
in line with the school planning inventory (para 2.12); and technical and financial&#13;
assistance for private, peri-urban schools serving children from families in the two&#13;
lowest income quintiles (para. 2.16).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
C. Component Description&#13;
2.3   The educational development component (US$82.8 million, including contingencies)&#13;
will (a) assist the SEEBAC to introduce the revised national curriculum for basic education&#13;
(US$3.4 million); (b) institutionalize the provision of updated educational materials, including&#13;
texts and workbooks for all public school students, sales to private schools and provision of&#13;
complementary materials and supplies for low-income students (US$12.4 million); (c) provide&#13;
training for about 12,600 teachers, school directors and supervisors in core subjects and teaching&#13;
techniques (US$8.6 million); (d) improve the student assessment system (US$3.1 million); (e)&#13;
strengthen the SEEBAC's capacity to design and manage expanded school nutrition programs&#13;
(US$3.5 million); (f) rehabilitate or construct 6,800 classrooms, including 1,000 to be used for&#13;
preschool, and finance preventive maintenance for 4,900 schools based on a cost-sharing&#13;
arrangement between PAs and the SEEBAC (US$48.1 million); and (g) support a pilot program&#13;
to upgrade private schools serving low-income students (US$3.7 million).&#13;
2.4   The management development component (US$16.7 million, including contingencies)&#13;
would include, within the context of gradual deconcentration of responsibilities, training, technical&#13;
assistance, and equipment to: (a) strengthen SEEBAC management procedures and&#13;
administrators (US$3.6 million); (b) improve and extend use of management information for basic&#13;
education (US$4.0 million); (c) extend the roles and capacities of parents associations in decision-&#13;
making to the areas of school planning, performance and monitoring (US$2.1 million); and (d)&#13;
support monitoring and evaluation of basic education, including the project (US$2.6 million).&#13;
The project would also finance the Project Coordination Unit (US$4.5 million) and an IDB&#13;
supervision and inspection fee of US$0.5 million.&#13;
2.5   Component A: Educational Development (US$82.8 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies). This component would provide inputs to strengthen school effectiveness. It&#13;
would improve equity by increasing coverage and targeting low-income children, and efficiency&#13;
by raising the quality of education and the share of students completing basic education.&#13;
2.6   A.1: National Curriculum Reform (US$3.4 million, including contingencies). The new&#13;
curriculum is designed to promote children's participation in the learning process based on revised&#13;
pedagogical techniques and integration of subject matter around relevant themes. To support its&#13;
introduction, the component would include the following:&#13;
(a)   Promotional Campaign. Information, consisting of bulletins, posters, and&#13;
seminars, would be prepared and distributed to promote curriculum transformation&#13;
and assess the level of acceptance. The campaign would be directed at educators&#13;
and community members with an interest in basic education.&#13;
(b)   Curriculum Implementation. The SEEBAC would coordinate a program of&#13;
technical assistance to be provided by international experts to a cadre of&#13;
curriculum promoters responsible for preparing district supervisors. The&#13;
supervisors would then support groups of directors and teachers at each school to&#13;
introduce the new curriculum. These groups would also orient other interested&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
community stakeholders on the new curriculum. The central SEEBAC would&#13;
provide the schools with sample syllabi and lesson plans for the preschool year&#13;
through grade eight in each subject area. The curriculum promotion would&#13;
correspond closely with Educational Materials and Resources and Human&#13;
Resources Development subcomponents of the proposed project (paras. 2.7 and&#13;
2.8). Each school's curriculum group would also attend inter-school and inter-&#13;
district workshops and receive guidance through radio programs (offered through&#13;
an educational radio training network already in place) and video productions on&#13;
lesson plan development. During the first year of project implementation, the&#13;
SEEBAC would focus on the promotional campaign and the institutional&#13;
infrastructure needed to carry out the transformation. Years two and three would&#13;
serve as a period of transition, as schools introduce the new curriculum, while the&#13;
movement from transition to full implementation would occur during years four&#13;
and five.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring and Evaluation. District supervisors would also be in charge of&#13;
reviewing and monitoring progress with use of the new curriculum at the school&#13;
level, with support from regional and central supervisors. To support&#13;
implementation, the SEEBAC would also coordinate training sessions, produce&#13;
manuals for teachers and parents, and distribute materials and equipment for&#13;
curriculum resource centers in regional offices, including support for establishing&#13;
new resource centers. It would produce an extensive guide for managing the&#13;
curriculum changes, intended for central, regional, and district promoters and&#13;
supervisors. The guide would include plans for monitoring the curriculum&#13;
transition process. The project will also support local curriculum innovations&#13;
selected by the SEEBAC and managed by the schools' PAs. The SEEBAC would&#13;
manage a national review to evaluate progress of the curriculum transformation&#13;
during year three of the project. In-service training for teachers would further&#13;
support this process.&#13;
2.7   A. 2: Educational Materials and Resources (US$12.4 million, including contingencies).&#13;
Supported by this component, the SEEBAC would undertake the following:&#13;
(a)   Textbooks, Workbooks, and Teacher's Guides. All children enrolled in public&#13;
schools offering basic education would be provided with textbooks and workbooks&#13;
in the core subjects of mathematics, science, social studies, and Spanish under the&#13;
new curriculum. Workbooks would be used for one school year and sold to the&#13;
students at cost. Sales, including sales to the private sector, would be used to help&#13;
cover costs for students unable to pay, based upon simple income criteria to be&#13;
applied by school managers and PAs. Accompanying teachers' guides would be&#13;
made available by grade and subject. Separate preschool materials would be&#13;
developed and provided to all preschool students.&#13;
(b)   Supplementary Learning Materials. The SEEBAC would also provide&#13;
supplemental reading materials, consisting of an educational newspaper issued&#13;
once per school-month, promotional literature for improved childhood nutrition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
and materials designed specifically for use by multigrade schools. The component&#13;
would support the development, printing, and distribution of materials for a period&#13;
of three years, with the exception of the nutritional and multigrade materials,&#13;
which would be financed for five years and one year, respectively.&#13;
(c)   Classroom Materials and Supplies. The component would finance provision of&#13;
classroom equipment packages, including maps, a globe, and charts for all public&#13;
schools offering basic education, as well as additional supplies, materials and&#13;
equipment tailored to the needs of preschool, multigrade classrooms, and schools&#13;
offering grades 5 through 8. In light of the system's dearth of reference materials,&#13;
mini-libraries, containing 25 to 100 books, would also be established for preschool&#13;
and grades 1-8. To reduce school costs for poor children, the project would&#13;
furnish them with notebooks, pencils, erasers, and other standard supplies.&#13;
(d)   Institutionalization. Technical assistance and computer equipment would be&#13;
provided under the project to support the establishment of SEEBAC's educational&#13;
materials entity. The agency would coordinate design, production, and distribution&#13;
of educational materials. Comprised of a small number of well-qualified staff, it&#13;
would continue to contract development, production and printing outside the&#13;
SEEBAC. The proposed operation would also assist the SEEBAC in arranging&#13;
for private storage of materials using proper inventory management techniques and&#13;
distribution to district offices through competitively contracted private firms.&#13;
Once delivered to district offices, materials would be turned over to PAs, which&#13;
would be responsible for distribution at the school level. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that the educational materials entity would be&#13;
established within 12 months of the date of loan effectiveness.&#13;
2.8   A. 3: Human Resources Development (US$8.6 million, including contingencies). To&#13;
improve teaching quality, the project would assist the SEEBAC to provide three complementary&#13;
training programs. As under the first phase of the Plan, the training would be delivered mainly&#13;
under contracts with national universities.&#13;
(a)   In-Service Certificate Training. Nearly 5,100 teachers with normal school or&#13;
upper secondary qualifications, and selected supervisors, would pursue the 72&#13;
credit Education Certificate, the minimum standard for all teachers in basic&#13;
education for 1998. This emphasizes subject-matter upgrading in mathematics,&#13;
social studies, social sciences and language arts (Spanish) and teaching techniques&#13;
which support the new curriculum.&#13;
(b)   In-Service Advanced Training. An advanced studies program would be&#13;
provided for about 3,800 teachers and school directors who have already&#13;
completed the Education Certificate. The program would allow them to pursue a&#13;
32 credit Associates Degree which focuses both on building general pedagogical&#13;
capacity and attainment of a specialty e.g., for preschool, multigrade or special&#13;
needs teaching; or for school management. Supervisors would participate in this&#13;
training. This program would also train a cadre of teachers and administrators for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
leadership positions, offering an additional 32 credit university degree program for&#13;
2,000 educators and additional 32 credit masters degree to 400. The in-service&#13;
training certificate and advanced training incorporate classwork, on-the-job follow-&#13;
up and supplementary support through use of radio programs. The SEEBAC&#13;
would continue to link salary incentives to completion of these programs and to&#13;
performance evaluation on-the-job.&#13;
(c)   Pre-Service Training. The SEEBAC would also develop and introduce a pre-&#13;
service curriculum for teacher-training, equivalent to the Certificate Program, for&#13;
up to 1,300 pre-service teaching candidates over the project implementation&#13;
period. It is expected that the training would be provided under contract, by&#13;
universities though normal schools could compete.&#13;
2.9   To assure coherence and integration between the training programs and the local&#13;
suppliers, the project will assist SEEBAC's Training Division to develop capacity to work with&#13;
university and other centers of expertise to develop standards and further develop content for&#13;
teacher-training which support the new curriculum and pedagogic techniques.&#13;
2.10   A. 4: National Student Assessment (US$3.1 million, including contingencies). To&#13;
strengthen the new assessment system, the project would provide technical assistance to improve&#13;
and monitor quality as well as dissemination and use of results.. The guiding principle for the&#13;
assessment would be to enhance its usefulness as a diagnostic tool to measure achievement in line&#13;
with objectives of the new curriculum. The practice of using teachers to prepare questions would&#13;
be continued. Early dissemination of results to educators, administrators, parents, and&#13;
communities for use at the school level, and monitoring of security and cost-efficiency would be&#13;
priorities.&#13;
(a)   Institutional Strengthening. The project would provide technical assistance and&#13;
training for staff of the National Assessment Division of the SEEBAC. The&#13;
support would help to increase the capacity for developing, producing,&#13;
distributing, administering and evaluating test results. This training would include&#13;
on-site technical assistance and internships abroad with educational testing&#13;
services. The component would also provide printed test materials during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(b)   Improving Design and Quality. Improvements in the design and quality of tests&#13;
would also be realized through the provision of training for teachers who propose&#13;
questions for the assessment. Training for personnel of the National Assessment&#13;
Division would also be designed to improve their capacity for question analysis.&#13;
(c)   Studies. The project would include several surveys to explore school and non-&#13;
school variables which affect student achievement in the Dominican Republic.&#13;
Results would feed into decisions on teaching requirements. Additional study&#13;
would be supported to assess the advantages and disadvantages of using the&#13;
assessment for diagnostic and promotion purposes, the current SEEBAC practice&#13;
(para. 1.32).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
2.11  A.5: School Nutrition Programs (US$3.5 million, including contingencies). This&#13;
component would improve children's learning capacity by expanding the nutrition and health&#13;
interventions initiated earlier by the SEEBAC. Specific objectives would include: (a) improving&#13;
the nutrition and health status of poor, school-aged children by reducing currently pervasive iron&#13;
and vitamin A deficiencies, alleviating hunger, and reducing parasitic infections; (b) promoting&#13;
improved nutrition and health practices affecting school-aged children; and (c) strengthening&#13;
capacity for developing, implementing, and evaluating school nutrition and health programs. The&#13;
component would support activities in five distinct areas, as described below. In addition, it&#13;
would incorporate school nutrition and health in the new curriculum.&#13;
(a)   School Feeding. School feeding programs would be expanded by the&#13;
Government to reach 300,000 school children. Under the project, the programs&#13;
would be strengthened to improve impact and decrease the need for external&#13;
assistance. Support would cover (a) administrative inputs, (b) training, particularly&#13;
aimed at community level participants and SEEBAC personnel, and (c)&#13;
development, implementation, and evaluation of alternative food products for&#13;
school feeding.&#13;
(b)   Micronutrients. The project would provide iron and vitanin A fortification of&#13;
school nutrition rations under the feeding program. To address micronutrient&#13;
needs among children not participating in school feeding programs, the component&#13;
would help to develop and test an iron and vitamin A supplementation program&#13;
through schools.&#13;
(c)   Deparasitation. Based on the results of an ongoing pilot program, a school-based&#13;
deparasitation program would be expanded by the SEEBAC in collaboration with&#13;
the Secretariat of Public Health (SESPAS). All children participating in school&#13;
feeding programs are expected to be covered by this program through the&#13;
SEEBAC.&#13;
(d)   Institutional Strengthening. By providing support to the newly-created Institute&#13;
for School Nutrition (INDOFANE), the component would increase the capacity&#13;
for developing and executing school nutrition and health programming. The&#13;
support would include local and international technical assistance, training of&#13;
INDOFANE personnel, and studies on children's nutritional status and needs and&#13;
on cost effectiveness of particular interventions.&#13;
(e)   Information, Education, and Communication Programs. The component&#13;
would continue the development and implementation of the programs started&#13;
during the Plan's first phase. Support would include training, development of&#13;
materials for school and community use to be provided through the proposed&#13;
educational materials entity (para. 2.7.b), and monitoring and evaluation of student&#13;
nutrition status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
2.12 A.6: School Facilities (US$48.1 million, including contingencies). The project would&#13;
provide for expanding and rehabilitating about 6,800 classrooms; materials for preventive&#13;
maintenance for 4,900 more; and limited construction of new classrooms. Excluding&#13;
maintenance, the component would benefit 330,000 students in grades 1 to 8 and 40,000&#13;
preschool students (about 30 percent of the relevant age group), and would account for 30&#13;
percent of the SEEBAC's physical plant investment requirements through 2000. Specifically,&#13;
support would be provided for:&#13;
(a)   Building 70 new classrooms in 40 multigrade schools which currently do not meet&#13;
minimum standards;&#13;
(b)   Rehabilitating 1,600 and replacing 400 classrooms in about 420 schools which are&#13;
in an advanced state of deterioration;&#13;
(c)   Repairing 5,125 classrooms in 1,500 schools which are structurally sound but&#13;
suffer from inadequate maintenance; and&#13;
(d)   Providing financial transfers to PAs to provide preventive maintenance to the&#13;
4,900 classrooms (US$300 per classroom per year), which have been improved&#13;
under Ten-Year Plan.&#13;
Outside of the project, the German Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) also plans to assist with&#13;
upgrading of school facilities in two of the country's poorest regions during 1996-2000. A loan of&#13;
the order of US$10 million is being considered.&#13;
2.13  In line with targeting criteria to be employed (para. 2.2), 1,000 classrooms for preschool&#13;
education would be included in these sub-components. The project would also provide 1,000&#13;
classrooms lacking furniture with desks (both for teachers and students), shelves, book cases, and&#13;
chalk boards.&#13;
2.14  Beyond use of targeting criteria and results of the 1995 facilities inventory, determination&#13;
of which schools receive rehabilitation or classroom replacement would be devolved to the district&#13;
level, with input from plans developed by PAs and SEEBAC district community participation&#13;
technicians. Regional PA councils and SEEBAC authorities would similarly coordinate decisions&#13;
on new classroom construction. Schools would base preventive maintenance decisions on plans&#13;
developed by their respective PAs and school directors, based on SEEBAC guidelines.&#13;
2.15  The SEEBAC would contract firms to carry out classroom construction and replacement.&#13;
To avoid past problems with the quality and transparency of such work, the SEEBAC would also&#13;
contract private firms and individuals to perform supervision. To attract supervisors for works at&#13;
isolated rural schools, supervision contracts would combine such schools with more accessible&#13;
urban ones. For minor repairs and maintenance, PAs would continue to identify school&#13;
improvement requirements, contract materials from local retailers, and provide labor and&#13;
supervision for the work. The SEEBAC's Department of School Supervision would provide&#13;
technical assistance to support this effort, which would also incorporate works supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
2.16 A.7: Pilot Program to Support Private Schools Assisting Low-Income Populations&#13;
(US$3.7 million, including contingencies). This component, designed as a pilot, would initiate&#13;
public support for private schools serving low-income populations. The pilot would be guided by&#13;
the SEEBAC's Department of Private Schools but executed through NGOs.&#13;
a)    Providing School Inputs. The SEEBAC would identify and retain NGOs with&#13;
experience in community assistance to identify schools to be upgraded based on&#13;
population served. PAs and school directors at these institutions would prepare&#13;
school development plans for NGO and SEEBAC review. It is expected that&#13;
educational improvements would consist of the same inputs to be provided under&#13;
the project to public schools, e.g., school materials and supplies for students and&#13;
teachers, and teacher training through the SEEBAC programs. In the pilot phase,&#13;
however, facilities improvements would be limited to minor works and provision&#13;
of technical assistance on space use (e.g., to improve ventilation, lighting) and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
b)    Institutional Support. To ensure effective implementation, monitoring and&#13;
follow-up, technical assistance and training would be provided for SEEBAC's&#13;
Department of Private Schools. A new private school management information&#13;
system would be strengthened and integrated into the SEEBAC's to provide&#13;
improved census and base-line educational and other data. Based on experience&#13;
under the pilot, proposals would be developed for broader support for private&#13;
schools.&#13;
2.17 Component B: Management Inputs. (US$16.7 million equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies). The management component would support the gradual deconcentration of&#13;
SEEBAC responsibilities and strengthen the effectiveness of resource use in the sector. It would&#13;
further support monitoring and evaluation of the Plan, and selected studies.&#13;
2.18  B.1. Institutional Strengthening and Staff Development: (US$3.6 million, including&#13;
contingencies). The project includes technical assistance and training for SEEBAC administrators&#13;
designed to strengthen key planning, programming, budgeting and implementation support&#13;
functions. All of the SEEBAC's 91 senior management staff, 1,400 technical staff, and directors&#13;
of schools with more than 600 students would participate. Specifically, the component would be&#13;
composed of the following:&#13;
a)    Management Support. The project will provide technical assistance and&#13;
equipment to the SEEBAC to develop improved management procedures and&#13;
processes focusing initially on budgetary, accounting and financial systems. It&#13;
would also finance a study to support administrative deconcentration.&#13;
b)    Establishing Continuous Training. Managers of administrator training and&#13;
SEEBAC training staff would be prepared by consultants during the first year of&#13;
the project to design and deliver or contract training and on-the-job support for&#13;
strengthening of management procedures and practices, e.g., in the budgeting area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Training would be organized by theme and delivered in one or more three-day&#13;
workshops conducted in district, regional, and central offices, and supplemented&#13;
using radio. Visits to schools and offices undertaking innovative best practices&#13;
would also be organized. Training would be organized to correspond with regular&#13;
tasks of the administrators. Follow-up would be provided by the SEEBAC&#13;
training staff and consultants, and selected supervisors, in the case of school&#13;
directors.&#13;
2.19 B.2: Management Information System. (US$4.0 million, including contingencies). The&#13;
MIS component is designed to strengthen communication linkages within the SEEBAC and&#13;
between the SEEBAC and schools, and to extend and integrate the use of the various new&#13;
information systems developed under the Plan.&#13;
2.20  The component would link the central SEEBAC to sub-national offices, schools, and&#13;
communities by:&#13;
a)    Completing an already-initiated telecommunications network (telephones and&#13;
computers) linking central offices to the SEEBAC's 11 regional offices, 81 district&#13;
offices, and the 504 schools serving more than 600 students; and telephonic links&#13;
with other schools where such links are available.&#13;
b)    Installing a one-way radio communication system for 700 small rural schools, to&#13;
make possible more efficient diffusion of educational and management material for&#13;
teachers and directors. The feasibility of developing a fully interactive radio&#13;
system for rural areas would be explored by a pilot project involving 190 rural&#13;
schools in three regions.&#13;
2.21   The component would also complete the modernization of the central SEEBAC's data&#13;
processing systems. It would integrate all SEEBAC units, including semi-autonomous entities,&#13;
into the MIS, consolidating and adapting for appropriate use at each administrative level the main&#13;
sub-systems of the SEEBAC (para. 1.41). Computer equipment and software would be provided&#13;
to link all district offices and larger schools to the MIS. The SEEBAC has ascertained that these&#13;
700 schools have the resources to cover 30 percent of investment cost (about US$0.5 million) and&#13;
would be expected to contribute. Much information would continue to be collected at the school&#13;
or district levels, and transferred to the central SEEBAC, where it would be processed and&#13;
disseminated in easily understandable formats.&#13;
2.22  These measures would aid the SEEBAC to use effectively a wide variety of data including&#13;
school and student data, assessment data, and financial management data. The linkages should&#13;
also facilitate bottom-up flows of key information. Consistent with the SEEBAC's commitment&#13;
to improve staff qualifications with regular training, the component would provide MIS training&#13;
for all SEEBAC staff at the central, regional and district levels and all school directors.&#13;
2.23  B.3: Community Participation (US$2.5 million, including contingencies). Community&#13;
participation is a central element of the Ten-Year Plan, incorporated in most project components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
The community participation component would serve to bolster the capacity of the parents&#13;
associations to take greater advantage of their role at the school level. It would seek to deepen&#13;
PA involvement in school planning and monitoring through the following sub-components:&#13;
a)    The establishment, by the SEEBAC, of a National School for Community&#13;
Participation, a 'school without walls" intended to integrate PAs more fully into&#13;
the basic education system's planning, management, and evaluation. The program&#13;
would be administered by the SEEBAC's Directorate of Community Participation&#13;
and provide organizational and leadership training to parents elected by peers to&#13;
serve as the PAs' participation facilitators. It would also provide specific training&#13;
in areas of PA involvement, e.g., fund-raising, school maintenance, monitoring of&#13;
attendance by teahcers and students, to groups of PA representatives, and attempt&#13;
to prepare and encourage women to seek positions of leadership within the PAs&#13;
(para. 1.15). Further training would also be directed to the SEEBAC's district and&#13;
regional participation facilitators, who would link communities with the SEEBAC&#13;
and provide continuous support.&#13;
b)    The provision, for some 640 schools, of funds for modest educational&#13;
improvements (e.g., for complementary materials). The improvements would be&#13;
financed through annual transfers to district offices, which in turn would channel&#13;
these resources on a competitive basis to schools whose PAs offer to meet a share&#13;
of the costs, draw up a school development plan, and meet project targeting&#13;
criteria.&#13;
c)    As the SEEBAC increases the number of district participation facilitators, from 50&#13;
to about 250, the component would improve their access to rural communities. It&#13;
would provide 250 motorcycles for re-sale (at cost) to the facilitators. Payments&#13;
would be automatically deducted from salaries, as under the ongoing projects for&#13;
district supervisors.&#13;
d)    The component would also assist the SEEBAC in: (i) the production of print and&#13;
audio-visual materials for PAs; (ii) organization of district, regional, and national&#13;
meetings for PA members to promote participation; and (iii) monitoring of the&#13;
achievements of participation.&#13;
2.24 B. 4: Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$2.1 million, including contingencies). A&#13;
Plan and project monitoring and evaluation system (MES) would be established within the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU) and integrated into the SEEBAC's management information system and&#13;
community feedback mechanisms. It would be composed of the following sub-systems:&#13;
(a)   Monitoring. The monitoring system would assist PCU and SEEBAC staff to&#13;
observe and track performance indicators identified for each project component..&#13;
An information bank would measure progress over time. The system would also&#13;
consist of field observation and focus groups and surveys of the beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
(b)   Evaluation. The evaluation system would measure the project's impact. It is&#13;
designed to ascertain whether or not project interventions are producing intended&#13;
results, cost-effectively. Included would be the use of a framework to link specific&#13;
interventions to project goals and objectives. Evaluations would be annual,&#13;
supported through the execution of a base-line study at the beginning at the project&#13;
(See Annex 4), which would incorporate data required to assess the impact and&#13;
cost-effectiveness over time of each project component. In line with Plan and&#13;
project objectives, key indicators of impact for basic education, based on system&#13;
performance and expenditure, have been selected for continuous review during&#13;
1996-2000. These are:&#13;
(i)    Reducing repetition rates from 13 to 10 percent; and dropout from 1 1 to 5&#13;
percent;&#13;
(ii)   Increasing enrollment rates from 92 to 97 percent;&#13;
(iii)   Increasing completion rates from 45 to 50 percent (grades 1-8);&#13;
(iv)    Increasing in-class instruction time from 684 to 770 hours;&#13;
(v)    Increasing public expenditure on education to 16 percent of total public&#13;
expenditure, recurrent expenditure per student from US$86 to US$140,&#13;
and expenditure as a share of GDP from 1.8 percent to 2.9 percent,&#13;
including continuous improvements in incentives for teachers and&#13;
administrators; and&#13;
(vi)   raising student achievement as measured by the national assessment.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government provided assurance that it would take all necessary&#13;
measures to achieve progress towards the perrormance and expenditure targets, set out in&#13;
an Implementation Letter.&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT, AND AUDITS&#13;
A. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.1    Project Costs. Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies and&#13;
excluding taxes, would be US$100.0 million equivalent (Annex 5). The IDB loan of US$52.0&#13;
million would finance 52 percent of the total; an IBRD loan of US$37.0 million would finance 37&#13;
percent of the total, and the Government would finance an amount equivalent to 11 percent.&#13;
Thirty percent of the total cost, US$30.0 million, would be foreign exchange.&#13;
3.2     Costs are estimated at July 1995 levels in U.S. dollars. Physical contingencies of 5 percent&#13;
for civil works are included in the total project cost. Annual price contingencies are calculated at&#13;
the projected international rate of 2.6 percent. This rate was applied to local as well as foreign&#13;
costs; periodic exchange rate adjustments are expected to compensate for differences between&#13;
projected US$ inflation and local inflation rates. Estimated costs for civil works and maintenance&#13;
materials are based on recent prices for similar works and the relevant materials. Estimated costs&#13;
of equipment, furniture, and vehicles are based on current c.i.f unit prices, adjusted to include&#13;
local transportation costs. Estimates for technical assistance and studies are based on recent&#13;
international and local costs.&#13;

Note: Totals rounded.&#13;
3.3     Financing Plan. The banks would finance 89 percent of the project, and the Government&#13;
11 percent. The bank loans would cover 100 percent of the project's estimated foreign exchange&#13;
costs and 85 percent of local costs. The banks will share the financing of major components,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
though discernible subcomponents will be financed by each. The KfW is considering financing&#13;
approximately US$10 million equivalent in the area of civil works for basic education (para.&#13;
2.12). This, if confirmed, would be considered incremental to the works included under the&#13;
project to be supported by the IDB and the IBRD.&#13;

3.4   Incremental Recurrent Costs. During the implementation period, the project will add an&#13;
average of US$2.3 million per year to the recurrent expenditures of the SEEBAC. These&#13;
incremental operating costs would be generated mainly by consultant fees and operating expenses&#13;
of the PCU, and materials for preventive maintenance of school facilities (Annex 8). The&#13;
operating expenses and maintenance materials costs would be financed on a declining basis by the&#13;
1DB and IBRD loans. In addition, to sustain project inputs and benefits beyond the&#13;
implementation period, an estimated US$9 million equivalent annually would be required,&#13;
primarily to finance materials replacement on a continuous basis as well as school maintenance,&#13;
the national assessment, and nutrition and parents association support. This amount would&#13;
represent about 4 percent of the SEEBAC resources projected for 2001 (Annex 9). With&#13;
economic growth forecast to grow at a minimum of 3 percent annually over the medium-term, the&#13;
project should not present an undue financial burden on the Government.&#13;

B. Procurement&#13;
3.5   The project would include procurement of civil works for new construction, rehabilitation&#13;
and minor repairs and preventive maintenance materials for school infrastructure. The project&#13;
would also finance the development of textbooks, procurement of library books and other&#13;
educational classroom packages and supplies, school and office furniture, radio and computing&#13;
equipment, vehicles, and printing services for informational and assessment materials, textbooks,&#13;
workbooks, educational newspapers and teachers' guides. In addition, the project would finance&#13;
studies and technical assistance services. Procurement of goods and works would be carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
through parallel financing with the IDB in accordance with each bank's procurement guidelines.&#13;
Procurement under EBRD financing would be conducted in accordance with IBRD's guidelines&#13;
for procurement (January 1995). The project would be supported by experienced staff in the&#13;
PCU who have acquired substantial experience in handling NCB and ICB procurement under the&#13;
ongoing IBRD and IDB-assisted basic education projects. Specific procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures under the Banks' procurement guidelines would be incorporated into the&#13;
project operational manual (para. 4.4). Technical assistance and training will be made available&#13;
when needed to ensure acceptable procedures.&#13;
3.6   Contracts would be packaged whenever possible to take advantage of economies of scale&#13;
and to ensure the quality of the goods and services procured and their consistency with project&#13;
objectives. Procurement arrangements for IBRD are summarized in Table 3.2 below.&#13;
Procurement of printing services and technical assistance for design of didactic and informational&#13;
materials would be contracted by the educational materials agency following IDB procedures.&#13;
For ICB, the PCU would use the standard bidding documents (SBDs) issued by the IBRD, with&#13;
such modifications as agreed by the Bank to be necessary for the purpose of the project. For&#13;
national competitive bidding (NCB), SBDs as agreed by the Bank with the Government of the&#13;
Dominican Republic would be used. The SEEBAC has prepared draft standard bidding&#13;
documents for goods and services for the project. These would be finalized in agreement with the&#13;
IBRD (para. 4.4).&#13;
3.7   Civil Works. Both Banks would finance against works totaling approximately US$35.0&#13;
million in value. These comprise new construction, rehabilitation and repair of classrooms. ICB is&#13;
not expected but would be used when packages equal or exceed the equivalent of US$3.0 million&#13;
in value. To the extent practicable, new construction works would be packaged in contracts to&#13;
exceed US$250,000 equivalent in value and awarded following NCB procedures, without&#13;
restriction to participation of foreign bidders. For works valued at US$250,000 equivalent or&#13;
less, lumpsum, fixed price contracts would be awarded on the basis of three quotations, up to an&#13;
aggregate limit of US$3.0 million equivalent. However, within this latter limit, for rehabilitation&#13;
or minor works in scattered, distant rural areas, direct contracting may be used for contracts&#13;
under US$50,000, up to an aggregate limit of US$0.8 million equivalent.&#13;
3.8   Educational Materials. IDB would finance printing of textbooks, workbooks and&#13;
teachers guides and distribution services for these materials. EBRD would finance library books&#13;
and classroom didactic materials and supplies of approximately US$11.2 million equivalent in&#13;
value and printing of nutritional information materials One large package for classroom materials&#13;
would be procured each year following ICB procedures. For contracts valued at less than the&#13;
equivalent of US$250,000 and subject to an aggregate limit of US$2.0 million, NCB procedures&#13;
would be used, without restricting participation of interested foreign suppliers. For purchases&#13;
valued at US$50,000 equivalent or less, national shopping procedures would be followed up to an&#13;
aggregate limit of US$1.8 million equivalent.&#13;
3.9   Other Goods. IDB would finance school furniture, communications and office equipment&#13;
and supplies. Other goods in the project would be financed by IBRD. These include one&#13;
package each of computer equipment and of vehicles, valued at US$200,000 equivalent, each, to&#13;
be procured under limited international bidding procedures. The IBRD would finance small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
purchases of materials to be used under the preventive maintenance program through national&#13;
staffing procedures. Annual purchases by PAs under this program will not exceed US$10,000&#13;
equivalent per school in classrooms improved under the ongoing loans.&#13;
3.10  Pharmaceuticals. The IBRD would finance procurement, inspection and distribution&#13;
services of micronutrients and pharmaceuticals under the nutrition program in the project.&#13;
Procurement of these goods would be carried out following LIB procedures. The SEEBAC&#13;
would ensure the selection of a list of international suppliers which meet World Health&#13;
Organization quality control requirements. These items would be procured in packages, allowing&#13;
for phased delivery, with IBRD financing amounting in total value to US$0.4 million.&#13;
3.11  Training, Technical Assistance and Studies an the PCU. The project would finance&#13;
technical assistance and consulting services to prepare studies, design information campaigns and&#13;
provide training. It would also finance contracts of fixed-term consultants in the PCU. The&#13;
studies to be performed under the project, center on, but are not limited to the decentralization of&#13;
educational management and educational effectiveness and financing. For subcomponents&#13;
financed by IBRD, individual consultants and consultant firms carrying out technical assistance,&#13;
including auditing services, would be hired following IBRD Guidelines for the Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). During&#13;
appraisal, training programs, technical assistance and studies to be financed under the project&#13;
were reviewed and agreed with the SEEBAC. For contracting training, technical assistance and&#13;
studies under the project, a standard invitation package and forms of contracts would be agreed&#13;
with the IBRD, and have been drafted by the SEEBAC.&#13;
3.12  Costs not Involving Procurement. Nearly 8 percent of total project costs, or US$7.7&#13;
million equivalent, do not involve procurement. These costs include mainly incremental&#13;
operational expenses.&#13;
3.13  Review by lBRD. Prior review by the IBRD would be required for: (a) all annual&#13;
procurement plans prepared by the SEEBAC; (b) procurement procedures and documentation for&#13;
all tender packages and contracts for goods and works for ICB, for goods under LIB, the first&#13;
contracts for goods and works under NCB, and all works contracts equal to, or more than,&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent. It is expected that these arrangements would permit review of nearly 65&#13;
percent of contracts by value, since a large portion of IBRD financing would be for small works in&#13;
school infrastructure to be awarded under NCB procedures All terms of reference for technical&#13;
assistance and studies would be subject to prior review by the IBRD. Documentation for&#13;
contracts with consultant firms, valued at US$75,000 or more, and for individual consultants,&#13;
valued at U$3 5,000 equivalent or more, would also be subject to prior review by the IBRD.&#13;
These thresholds are justified, based on review of estimated costs and the nature of required&#13;
consultant services. All other documentation would be subject to ex-post review during auditing&#13;
and by IBRD supervision missions, on a random basis.&#13;
3.14  No recent Country Procurement Assessment on the Dominican Republic is available.&#13;
However, procurement regulations clearly authorize the application of procurement procedures of&#13;
international financial institutions for the procurement of civil works, goods and services, where&#13;
the financing for such procurement comes from such institutions.&#13;

C. Disbursements&#13;
3.15  The proposed project would be implemented over a period of five years, beginning early&#13;
1996 (Annex 10). The proceeds of the IDB and IBRD loans would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
five and a half years, ending June 30, 2001 (Annex 7).&#13;
3.16 Disbursement of IBRD Funds. The proceeds of the IBRD loan would be disbursed as&#13;
follows: (a) civil works - 78 percent of construction, rehabilitation and minor repair; (b)&#13;
educational materials and printing, and equipment -100 percent of foreign and 92 percent of local&#13;
expenditures; (c) maintenance materials - 100 percent until withdrawals have reached an&#13;
aggregate amount equivalent to US$1.3 million, and 70 percent thereafter; (d) pharmaceuticals -&#13;
50 percent of expenditures; and (e) training, technical assistance and studies and fixed-term&#13;
contracts for staff in PCU- 100 percent of expenditures, excluding taxes.&#13;
3.17  In view of the advanced preparation and the scheduling of the project, retroactive&#13;
financing would be provided for eligible expenditures incurred after May 1995, up to an amount&#13;
of US$0.5 million equivalent. Proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against expenditures that&#13;
would be submitted to the IBRD and fully documented for contracts valued a: (a) US$500,000&#13;
equivalent or more for works; (b) US$ 250,000 or more for goods, or if awarded through LIB&#13;
procedures; (c) the first contracts to be awarded for goods and works through NCB; (d)&#13;
US$75,000 or more for consulting firms; and (e) US$35,000 or more for individual consultants.&#13;
Claims for expenditures of lesser amounts would be disbursed against presentation of statements&#13;
of expenditure (SOEs), for which the supporting documentation would be retained by the&#13;
SEEBAC for inspection by the banks and by external auditors. A Special Account would be&#13;
opened in the Central Bank with an initial deposit of US$600,000, rising to US$1.8 million after&#13;
withdrawals and special commitments reach US$5.5 million. Payments from the Special Account&#13;
would be made at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of expenditure, pertain to eligible&#13;
expenditures and be supported by the required documentation. The Government would establish&#13;
a project account in local currency with an initial deposit equivalent to US$400,000, or about four&#13;
months local contribution. During negotiations, the Government agreed to allocate and&#13;
make available annually the counterpart funds required for project implementation, set out&#13;
in the Implementation Letter, and to maintain a project account in pesos throughout&#13;
project implementation. A condition for IBRD loan effectiveness (and IDB disbursement)&#13;
would be the establishment and initial provision of US$400,000 equivalent for this account,&#13;
and confirmation of the availability of the budget allocation required in the first year of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.18  SEEBAC would establish and maintain separate accounts and records for each loan to&#13;
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources and expenditures related to&#13;
the project. The SEEBAC would maintain a consolidated account of all resources and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
expenditures under the project. These accounts would be audited annually by private independent&#13;
auditors satisfactory to the IDB and IBRD. The audits, which would include a separate opinion&#13;
on the adequacy of statements of expenditures as a basis of loan disbursements, would be&#13;
forwarded to the banks no later that six months after the end of each fiscal year during the period&#13;
of project execution. To support the timely provision of audit reports, SEEBAC will contract the&#13;
auditing firm at the beginning of each project year to be considered for the auditing exercise. The&#13;
annual audits would also cover a random sample of the records and accounts maintained by&#13;
parents associations. The PCU would set up, before effectiveness, a chart of accounts and&#13;
develop an administrative manual for the financial operation of the project. The accounting&#13;
system would allow for reconciliation of the project accounts with the general budgetary&#13;
accounting system of the SEEBAC. During negotiations agreement was reached that the&#13;
Government would: (a) have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited by&#13;
independent and qualified auditors, in accordance with generally accepted auditing&#13;
standards and procedures; (b) furnish to the banks as soon as available, but in any case not&#13;
later than six months after the end of each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit&#13;
reports; and (c) furnish to the banks such other information concerning the records and&#13;
accounts as well as the audit as the banks would from time to time reasonably request. A&#13;
condition of effectiveness would be the adoption by the Government of an internal&#13;
accounting system satisfactory to the IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Project Implementation&#13;
4.1   SEEBAC will be responsible for the execution of the project. An agreement between the&#13;
borrower and the executing agency to transfer resources from the IDB loan will be a condition for&#13;
IDB disbursement.&#13;
4.2   Management Structure. The Secretary of the SEEBAC would be responsible for&#13;
project management. The Secretary would be assisted by a single Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU). Daily operations would be supervised by a Project Coordinator. The Project Coordinator&#13;
would be responsible for two units within the PCU: the Technical Unit, which would monitor and&#13;
support technical execution of project components, focusing on the build-up of decision-making&#13;
and implementation capacity within the respective SEEBAC departments during project&#13;
implementation; and the Administrative Unit, which would manage the project's personnel,&#13;
procurement, finance, accounting, and auditing activities. The PCU would be staffed by about 16&#13;
local consultants, including the Project Coordinator, Chief of the Administrative Unit, Chief of the&#13;
Technical Unit, and consultants for each subcomponent. In the Technical Unit, consultants for&#13;
the subcomponents would serve as advisors to the chiefs of the relevant SEEBAC departments&#13;
(i.e., the consultant responsible for school rehabilitation would support the Director of School&#13;
Facilities). Direct implementation would be carried out by the SEEBAC's district offices, with&#13;
support provided or arranged by the PCU and central and regional SEEBAC offices. For&#13;
maintenance and minor repair of school facilities, the PAs would be responsible for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4.3   The PCU would provide funds (US$300,000 equivalent) for paying regular SEEBAC&#13;
staff involved with the project for extra hours worked on priority project activities. Criteria for&#13;
fund use include payment at the actual salary rate for hours worked beyond the official working&#13;
day, which ends at 2:30 p.m. Financing for PCU operations is included under the project. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (EDB disbursement) of the proposed project, the Government&#13;
would have established the PCU and appointed the PCU Coordinator with qualifications&#13;
and terms of reference acceptable to the IBRD.&#13;
4.4   Implementation Processes. Implementation procedures for the project would be set out&#13;
in an operational manual. The manual would describe implementation responsibilities and&#13;
processes by subcomponent, financial flows and control mechanisms, procurement arrangements&#13;
and targeting and cost-sharing criteria. For procurement, standard bidding documents acceptable&#13;
to the banks would be included (paras. 3.5-3.6). As a condition for effectiveness for the IBRD&#13;
(disbursement for the IDB) the Government would be asked to finalize and put into use an&#13;
operational manual acceptable to the banks, incorporating standard bidding documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
B. Project Monitoring and Review&#13;
4.5   Monitoring. The banks and PCU will monitor the key indicators of Plan and project&#13;
achievements as well as physical and financial implementation of project components (para. 2.24&#13;
and Annex 4). The efficiency and coverage targets are based on analysis of information made&#13;
available by the SEEBAC and would be adjusted during project implementation on the basis of&#13;
indicators generated through the SEEBAC's management information system and national&#13;
assessment system. The targeted gains are projected on the basis of quality improvements&#13;
expected to result from project expenditures and inputs and the Government's continued financial&#13;
and political commitment to improving basic public education.. Because achievements in the&#13;
provision of project inputs (e.g., number of teachers trained, number of students provided with&#13;
texts and workbooks) would largely determine the progress toward the performance targets, these&#13;
inputs would also be closely monitored.&#13;
4.6   Annual Review. The results of project monitoring would form a central focus of an&#13;
annual review of project implementation. The review would be conducted by the SEEBAC and&#13;
submitted for review to the IDB and IBRD (Annex 7). It would assess the previous year's&#13;
progress toward achieving expenditure, management, and physical targets, and establish targets&#13;
and schedules for the following year. Resolution of implementation problems and adjustments in&#13;
project content would also form a focus of the reviews. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
agreed to furnish to the banks, by February 1 each year, a report of results of&#13;
implementation for the previous year and proposed activities and budgetary allocations the&#13;
following year; and to undertake, by February 28 of each year, beginning in 1996, an&#13;
annual review of project execution jointly with the IDB and IBRD.&#13;
4.7   Mid-Term Review. The third annual review would be the mid-term review and would be&#13;
undertaken jointly by the IBRD, IDB and the SEEBAC. It would assess overall project&#13;
performance and initial impact in the light of Plan and project objectives. During negotiations,&#13;
the Government agreed that it would conduct jointly with the IDB and the IBRD an in-&#13;
depth review of project implementation, and prepare, on the basis of that review, action&#13;
plans satisfactory to the banks to be initiated by February 28, 1999.&#13;
4.8   Project Supervision.The project would require close supervision, especially if new&#13;
leadership is appointed to the SEEBAC following planned 1996 elections and if the SEEBAC&#13;
continues to deconcentrate management responsibilities as is currently contemplated. Bank&#13;
missions would visit a broad sample of participating regions at least once every year for the first&#13;
two years of the project. For the first year, supervision requirements are estimated at 20 staff-&#13;
weeks of headquarters staff and comprehensive continuous supervision from the IDB&#13;
Representation in the Dominican Republic. From the second year on, supervision requirements&#13;
would decrease to about 15 staff-weeks of headquarters staff annually. Local supervision would&#13;
play an important role, particularly for components entailing local management of project&#13;
resources such as school rehabilitation and maintenance, about 10 staff-weeks per year of local&#13;
supervision would be needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5. PROJECT BENEFITS, ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1   Main Benefits. The proposed project aims to strengthen and extend coverage of basic&#13;
education. Achievement of targeted increases in expenditure, including the regular provision of&#13;
teacher training and student and teacher materials, together with systematic assessment of student&#13;
achievement, should raise the overall quality and efficiency of basic education. While all children&#13;
in the relevant age-group stand to benefit from the project, the greatest share of benefits will&#13;
accrue to the poor, who would be the main beneficiaries of preschool inputs, school feeding and&#13;
school facilities upgrading. This group represents about 400,000 children, or about 30 percent of&#13;
anticipated enrollment in public basic education during project implementation. Reaching the&#13;
program's management development objectives would further contribute to improvements in&#13;
overall resource management at the central and local levels. In particular, the planned&#13;
maintenance of widespread national support and oversight for the Ten-Year Education Plan, and&#13;
of enhanced community participation at the school level, could be expected to help sustain&#13;
improved educational quality and efficiency of basic education.&#13;
5.2   Environmental Aspects. The project would enhance environmental conservation&#13;
through introduction of environmental themes in the basic education curriculum and is rated "C".&#13;
5.3   Poverty Category. The proposed project falls under the program objective category of&#13;
poverty reduction and incorporates a program of targeted poverty interventions (para. 2.2). The&#13;
preschool expansion, school nutrition and facilities rehabilitation and expansion components&#13;
would target poverty groups based on income and nutrition data. The pilot support for private&#13;
schools would also target low-income students.&#13;
5.4   Participatory Approach. The proposed project focuses heavily on use of participatory&#13;
techniques at all levels, e.g., from involving a broad spectrum of interest groups in Plan design to&#13;
supporting parents participation in management at the school level. Mid-term results under the&#13;
current project confirm that this participation accounts largely for the Plan's early success.&#13;
Continued broad support and local participation will be important components of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
B. Economic Justification&#13;
5.5   Feasibility. As part of the project preparation exercise, a financial model was developed&#13;
to assess the feasibility of Plan expenditure targets (Annex 8). 5 Financing targets, consistent with&#13;
the Ten-Year Plan, for salary and other recurrent expenditures and capital expenditures, and&#13;
enrollment projections were incorporated in the model. The model also includes projected&#13;
population growth and conservative projections for GDP growth (3 percent per annum) through&#13;
2006, employment growth and fiscal policies and debt servicing capacity. Based on these&#13;
projections, model results indicate that public expenditure on education would need to grow to&#13;
nearly 16 percent of total public expenditure by 2000. The ratio of education expenditure to GDP&#13;
would reach 2.4 percent and recurrent expenditure per student, about US$140. Trends in overall&#13;
and education expenditure, particularly March 1995 salary increases of about a third, the&#13;
increased interest of all political groups and civil society in public education, and the likelihood&#13;
that any new government will address the remaining sectoral issues permit the banks to assess the&#13;
model's scenario as reasonable and likely. On the cost side, the estimated jump in recurrent&#13;
expenditure per student from US$86 in 1995 to US$140 in 2000 will be partially offset by an&#13;
estimated savings as a result of reduced student repetition equivalent to 3 percent of projected&#13;
expenditure on SEEBAC programs and by a significant shift in the balance between capital and&#13;
recurrent expenditures, in favor of recurrent expenditures (Annex 9).&#13;
5.6    Cost-effectiveness. Investment in basic education generally has a high economic return&#13;
and is recognized as a prerequisite for improving labor productivity and earning capacity. In line&#13;
with results obtained elsewhere, evidence that basic education warrants investment is strong for&#13;
the Dominican Republic. Using 1991 data and the Psacharopoulos and Ng model, rates of return&#13;
for basic education were estimated, yielding a social rate of return of 18 percent for individuals&#13;
completing grade 4 as compared with those with no education, and a 14 percent return for those&#13;
completing grade 8. Private rates of return relative to individuals without any education were: 20&#13;
percent for those completing grade 4 and 15 percent for those completing grade 8. In view of&#13;
favorable prospects for medium-term growth and anticipated improvements in quality of basic&#13;
education, the average rates of return could be expected to continue or improve in the future.&#13;
5.7   Systematic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the particular investment inputs selected&#13;
for the project versus alternative inputs, was not undertaken owing to a lack of data. However,&#13;
project inputs would build largely on those provided through the Plan during 1991-95. These&#13;
inputs have contributed substantially to the efficiency and quality gains achieved over that period,&#13;
as evident in a reported 35 percent reduction in student repetition and a 125 percent increase in&#13;
the student completion rate for grades 1 - 8. Based upon IBRD and other experience, the&#13;
proposed project inputs represent economical solutions to providing goods and services&#13;
considered to be effective for raising the quality and internal efficiency of basic education (Annex&#13;
9). Included are the large educational materials, teacher training and facilities upgrading&#13;
programs, as well as the student assessment system. The latter, together with the community&#13;
participation and continued stakeholder involvement at the national level, would serve to enhance&#13;

(CIECA), June 6, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
accountability and promote effective use of resources. The project would establish the requisite&#13;
baseline information to monitor the cost-effectiveness of project inputs in the future. Specific&#13;
tradeoffs, which were considered in project design, centered on teachers: Optimum levels of&#13;
training and a significantly extended school-day were traded based upon affordability for lower-&#13;
cost solutions for the medium term.&#13;
C. Risks&#13;
5.8   The main risks to further, effective execution of the Plan center on political and macro-&#13;
economic uncertainties, potential financing constraints, and continuing weaknesses in technical&#13;
capacity of the SEEBAC. A risk exists that opposition parties and the teachers union would&#13;
reduce support for the Plan prior to, or after elections, currently planned for April 1996. The risk&#13;
of a decline in funding for basic education, through diversion of discretionary funds, could also&#13;
result from political change. These risks are reduced by continued emphasis on incorporating all&#13;
stakeholders in the educational development process and the likelihood that future governments&#13;
would continue to accord priority to the provision of basic education services. While the risk of a&#13;
macro-economic downturn cannot readily be mitigated, the small share for project costs in total&#13;
basic education expenditure, coupled with the low local contribution to project financing, should&#13;
ensure continuous project funding. A final risk exists that SEEBAC's technical capacity may not&#13;
be sufficient over the near-term to support efficient execution of the program. This risk will be&#13;
minimized through the design of technical support to facilitate the transfer of skills to the&#13;
SEEBAC. Continued improvement of incentives for administrators should also help attract&#13;
increasingly qualified personnel to the SEEBAC.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
6.1   During Negotiations agreement was reached with the Government:&#13;
(a)   to establish the educational materials agency within 12 months of loan&#13;
effectiveness (para. 2.7d);&#13;
(b)   to take all necessary measures to achieve progress towards performance and&#13;
expenditure targets as set out in the Project Implementation Letter (paras. 2.24b);&#13;
(c)   to allocate and make available annually the counterpart funds required for project&#13;
implementation as set out in the Project Implementation Letter and to maintain a&#13;
project account in pesos throughout project implementation (para. 3.18);&#13;
(d)   to have the records and accounts for each fiscal year audited by independent and&#13;
qualified auditors; furnish to the IDB and IBRD not later than six months after the&#13;
end of each year a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and furnish to the&#13;
banks such other information related to records and accounts as may be reasonably&#13;
requested (3.19);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
(e)   to furnish to the IBRD and IDB by February 1 each year, beginning in 1996, a&#13;
report of results of implementation for the previous year and proposed activities&#13;
and budgetary allocations for the following year (para. 4.6); and to undertake by&#13;
February 28 of each year, beginning in 1996, an annual review of project execution&#13;
jointly with the IBRD and IDB.&#13;
(f)   to conduct jointly with the IDB and the IBRD an in-depth review of project&#13;
implementation and prepare, on the basis of that review, action plans satisfactory&#13;
to the IDB and the IBRD to be initiated by February 28, 1999 (para. 4.7);&#13;
6.2   Conditions of Loan Effectiveness would include:&#13;
(a)   confirmation of the availability of the budget allocation required for the first year&#13;
of project implementation and establishment and initial provision of funds for the&#13;
project account (para. 3.18);&#13;
(b)   adoption of an internal accounting system for the project satisfactory to the IBRD&#13;
(para. 3.19);&#13;
(c)   established the PCU and appointed the PCU Coordinator with qualifications and&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the IBRD (para. 4.3); and&#13;
(d)   finalization and introduction of the operational manual for the project satisfactory&#13;
to the IBRD and IDB covering implementation responsibilities and processes by&#13;
subcomponent, including financial flows and control mechanisms, procurement&#13;
arrangements and model bidding documents, and targeting and cost-sharing&#13;
criteria (para. 4.4).&#13;
6.3   Recommendation. Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would constitute a suitable basis for an IBRD loan of US$37.0 million for the Dominican&#13;
Republic.&#13;

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
SECOND BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
THE BASIC EDUCATION SYSTEM&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
1.1   Composition of the Education Sector. The education system consists of an eight&#13;
year basic education cycle, followed by a four year secondary school education. A&#13;
preprimary year for 5-year-olds is not yet mandatory. However, most urban public&#13;
schools accommodate this level when space is available. There are a total of 7,918 public&#13;
and private basic education and secondary schools: 6,277 public, 1,641 private in both&#13;
urban and rural areas. Basic education is offered in 5,036 public schools and 1,641 private&#13;
schools which includes pre-school, regular basic education, basic education for adults and&#13;
special education. Enrollment in grades 1-8 has been increasing since 1991 from 952,000&#13;
to 1,195,000 with an expected increase to 1,586,400 in 2001. Enrollment in private&#13;
schools is substantial. It is interesting to note that the participation of lower-income&#13;
students in private schools is quite high. Students categorized in the 50% lower income&#13;
group make up 39.1 percent of basic education enrollment, 42.9 percent of private basic&#13;
education enrollment and 27.4 percent of private secondary enrollment. Middle income&#13;
students are also found in similar proportions in private school enrollment: 39.1 percent in&#13;
preschool, 43.6 percent in basic education and 49.4 percent in secondary education.&#13;
Private education in the Dominican Republic does not cater exclusively to the upper&#13;
income children.&#13;
1.2   Organization of SEEBAC. Primary and secondary education are managed by&#13;
the Secretariat of Education, Arts, and Culture (SEEBAC). The SEEBAC is composed of&#13;
a central office, 11 regional offices, and 81 district offices. Almost 40 percent of rural&#13;
schools are single room multigrade schools which do not offer all eight grades. The&#13;
SEEBAC employs about 3,000 administrators, and 28,400 teachers, including school&#13;
directors. About 5 percent of teachers deliver preschool services, 69 percent provide&#13;
basic education, 15 percent teach in secondary schools, and 11 percent are shared between&#13;
adult education, vocational education, and normal schools (teachers' colleges). Higher&#13;
education is the responsibility of the National Council for Higher Education, which&#13;
operates independently from the SEEBAC. Girls and boys participate in basic education&#13;
in equal numbers. The private sector accounts for 1 in every 5 students receiving basic&#13;
education services and 2 out of every 5 students enrolled in secondary and higher&#13;
education.  The State currently provides public education free of charge, with the&#13;
exception of fees charged for use of materials. Nominal tuition is charged at the tertiary&#13;
level.&#13;
1.3   Management.  SEEBAC's central office is responsible for all major decisions&#13;
regarding financial, administrative and academic affairs. SEEBAC's central office is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
pivotal point for planning, programming, budgeting and management information system.&#13;
The central government retains control over educational financing, with provincial and&#13;
municipal governments playing no significant role.  School accreditation, national&#13;
curriculum, textbooks and national examinations are the responsibility of the central office.&#13;
Private schools adhere to the national curriculum, textbooks and national examination&#13;
system.&#13;
1.4   Financing. The SEEBAC currently devotes 1 percent of its spending to preschool&#13;
services and 67 percent of national education spending to basic education. Secondary&#13;
services receive 21 percent, and 10 percent of public spending is allocated to adult and&#13;
technical education. Private investment in preschool, primary and secondary education&#13;
account for a significant share of total education spending, and now makes up a quarter of&#13;
overall allocations on preschool and primary education and almost 40 percent of&#13;
secondary education.&#13;

SECOND BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Lessons of Previous Experience - IBRD&#13;
1.    During the 1970s and 1980s, the World Bank group operations in the sector consisted of a&#13;
series of partial successes and false starts. An IDA credit of US$4.0 million (Credit 234-DO) was&#13;
approved in 1970 and completed in 1977, two years behind schedule. It aimed at improving&#13;
training for primary school teachers, strengthening the curriculum and structure of secondary&#13;
education, and preparing a long-term plan for educational development. While technically sound,&#13;
the development plan was not implemented due to difficulties encountered in managing its&#13;
technical assistance component. Opposition from teachers and politicians precluded completion&#13;
of the proposed reform of secondary education. A US$8.0 million project (Loan 1142-DO),&#13;
aimed at rationalizing the physical distribution of rural primary education, was approved in 1975.&#13;
It financed the construction and equipment of rural community learning centers (RCLCs) and&#13;
agricultural and vocational training centers. It also sought to upgrade the quality of teaching in&#13;
the RCLCs. After a three year delay, the project created a number of RCLCs, a training program&#13;
for primary teachers, and the National Institute for Vocational Training (INFOTEP). A third&#13;
project, to improve rural primary education, was appraised in November 1981 but was dropped in&#13;
1983 by a new government because of a lack of willingness to borrow for social investment. A&#13;
fourth operation, the Vocational Training Project, was approved in 1985 but was canceled in&#13;
1986 because of political differences between the President and the Board of INFOTEP, the&#13;
project's beneficiary. The most recent operation is the ongoing Primary Education Development&#13;
Project (Loan 3351-DO, US$15 million). Its content, which centers upon teacher and supervisor&#13;
training, student assessment, MIS development, school nutrition, facilities upgrading, and&#13;
community participation, has been described in earlier sections of this report. Due to rapid and&#13;
efficient implementation, the project will close two years ahead of schedule, in mid 1996.&#13;
2.    The main lessons drawn from the mid-term review of the ongoing projects and earlier&#13;
project implementation experience center on the importance of broad support among project&#13;
stakeholders, appropriate technical designs and efficient implementation arrangements.&#13;
3.    The success of the current projects assisted by the IDB and IBRD stems from strong&#13;
government commitment and heavy investments in consensus-building by sector stakeholders. A&#13;
relatively stable macro-economic environment also has contributed. These elements were lacking&#13;
during implementation of the earlier projects, which foundered mainly on political differences&#13;
between the government and the teachers' union, and unreliable counterpart financing. The&#13;
proposed program would benefit from the momentum established under the Plan and ongoing&#13;
projects and continued emphasis on maintaining broad support. Further support would accrue&#13;
through the widespread participation of practitioners in the design of the new curriculum,&#13;
administrator training, and the student assessment systems, and through expanded community&#13;
participation at the school level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;

4.    Technical lessons have emerged from the implementation experience with the ongoing&#13;
projects as well. Central among these is the need to retool curriculum, didactic materials, and&#13;
school rehabilitation and maintenance components to account for the special needs of preschool&#13;
education and multigrade classrooms.  Institutionally and financially sustainable means for&#13;
providing pre- and in-service training and educational materials of appropriate quality also would&#13;
be necessary to replace temporary mechanisms based on loan financing. Further, early results&#13;
suggest the need for strategic use of new information systems, including the student assessment,&#13;
to strengthen monitoring and evaluation under the Plan.&#13;
5.    Lessons drawn from project management experience also would be addressed in the&#13;
proposed operation. Strong leadership from the Office of the Secretary of the SEEBAC,&#13;
supported by competent project coordination units of the IBRD and IDB-financed projects,&#13;
account for the success of implementation of the Emergency Phase of the Plan. However,&#13;
institutional sustainability will depend upon the transfer of technical skills to the relevant central,&#13;
regional and district offices of the SEEBAC. The proposed project would include support for&#13;
effecting this transfer. Under the ongoing projects, the UNDP has executed the Bank's loan, and&#13;
the IDB Resident Mission has provided close oversight of the SEEBAC's compliance with&#13;
procurement and disbursement guidelines. These arrangement have speeded project execution&#13;
and avoided problems stemming from SEEBAC's poor administrative apparatus. However, the&#13;
complete separation of the Bank and IDB coordination units has unnecessarily increased overhead&#13;
costs and limited coordination. Under the proposed operations, all project management functions&#13;
would be integrated in one unit.&#13;

SECOND BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
FRAMEWORK FOR DECONCENTRATED MANAGEMENT&#13;
OF BASIC EDUCATION&#13;
1.    Recognizing the ill-effects of centralization, the SEEBAC is using a consensus-building&#13;
approach to prepare the proposed Education law, intended for promulgation after the 1996&#13;
Presidential election. Under the proposed Law, administration and decision-making&#13;
responsibilities would be divided respectively between (a) the SEEBAC staff at the school,&#13;
district, regional and national level and (b) corresponding public councils, composed of the&#13;
highest SEEBAC official at that level and elected representatives of parents associations, the&#13;
teachers' union, civil society (e.g., churches, businesses, NGOs).&#13;
2.    For schools, principals would be responsible for day-to-day management while the&#13;
councils would prepare annual plans, programs, and operating and capital budgets. Parents&#13;
associations would maintain their functions of teacher and student absenteeism supervision,&#13;
procurement and labor for school rehabilitation and maintenance, and annual teacher evaluation.&#13;
School council decisions would be submitted to their respective districts, which would become&#13;
the SEEBAC/s primary axes for planning, programming, budgeting, supervision, technical&#13;
assistance to schools, arbitrating conflicts within schools, coordinating school feeding services and&#13;
in-service training to personnel with university and NGO providers, and recommending to the&#13;
central government hiring and firing decisions for teachers and principals. Regional offices would&#13;
recommend to the central government hiring and firing of SEEBAC district staff, consolidate the&#13;
plans, programs, and budgets of their respective districts, and provide supervision and support to&#13;
the districts. Consolidation of the national budget, payment of personnel, administration of the&#13;
employment rosters, accreditation, curriculum, text book, and training design, and final arbitration&#13;
of sub-national conflicts would remain at the central SEEBAC. The National Education Council,&#13;
similar in composition to the district and regional councils, would approved the budget before its&#13;
submission to the president for presentation to Congress.&#13;
3.    In terms of the distribution and management of financial resources, each schools annually&#13;
would receive a direct central SEEBAC appropriation to finance preventive maintenance, while&#13;
parents would continue their responsibilities for managing school funds. The district offices&#13;
would receive transfers to finance rehabilitation and classroom expansion. These transfers would&#13;
be allocated in turn to the schools best meeting, in the district council's judgment, centrally-&#13;
established targeting criteria. Regional offices would administer new school construction, while&#13;
the central SEEBAC would perform audits and manage financial transfers. In short, (a) day-to-&#13;
day management and investment decisions would be devolved down; (b) planning, programming,&#13;
and budgeting would flow from bottom-up, and (c) establishment of standards, monitoring, and&#13;
financing would flow top-down. While the SEEBAC has already made some progress in&#13;
preparing for such a fundamental reform, substantial investments in planning, training, and&#13;
equipment would be needed to implement is successfully.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PROJECT REVIEW AND&#13;
SUPERVISION SCHEDULE&#13;
1.    The composition and staffing level of the supervision program for each year of&#13;
project implementation are presented in Table 1. The supervision teams will be carefully&#13;
planned, and will consist of the Task Managers, MBRD and IDB staff, and consultants with&#13;
expertise in the areas of education (evaluation, teacher training, textbooks and&#13;
curriculum), community organization, information communication, management and&#13;
institutional development, procurement and project implementation. Supervision missions&#13;
will normally be conducted twice a year, in February and July, beginning in July of 1996.&#13;
All missions will involve discussions with project officials in SEEBAC headquarters, as&#13;
well as field visits, on the basis of which the mission will evaluate the project. A project&#13;
launch mission is included in the first year.&#13;
2.    Proiect Launch Seminar. A Project Launch Seminar will be conducted to: (a)&#13;
review implementation of the project's rules and procedures manual, and familiarize&#13;
SEEBAC with the project's monitoring procedures and changes in the banks guidelines&#13;
and procedures on procurement, disbursement and auditing requirements; and (b) review&#13;
the project requirements for progress reports on the implementation of the Annual Work&#13;
Programs.&#13;
3.    Annual Review.  The purpose of the annual review is to assess project&#13;
performance against specific objectives and targets, primarily through the analysis of two&#13;
documents: (a) the Project Implementation Report for the year under review; and (b) the&#13;
Project Plan for the next calendar year. Annual Reviews will take place in February of&#13;
each year.&#13;
4.   In Preparation for the Annual Project Review, the PCU  Coordinator, in&#13;
coordination with responsible units, will prepare and present to the Banks, no later than&#13;
February 1st of each year, the foliowing documents.&#13;
(i)   compliance with the Project Operations Manual;&#13;
(ii)  compliance with the covenants of the banks Loan&#13;
Agreements;&#13;
(iii) information pertaining to all Project Monitoring and&#13;
Impact Evaluation Indicators; and&#13;
(iv)  status of procurement of goods and services;&#13;
(v)   highlights of findings, lessons learned and problems&#13;
pertaining to the technical, institutional, administrative&#13;
or financial implementation of the project.&#13;

(iii) detailed procurement plan;&#13;
(iv)   detailed budget by source of funds and uses, for each&#13;
quarter, specifying counterpart funds;&#13;
(v)   specific reports when needed.&#13;
5.    Project Mid-Term Review. This review will be carried out in early 1999 jointly by&#13;
the Government, IDB and IBRD. The focus of the review is to ascertain to what extent&#13;
the project has achieved its development objectives. The PCU Coordinator will prepare&#13;
the same reports for the Project Mid-Term Review as for the Annual Project Reviews.&#13;
However, if special issues warrant more detailed analysis, additional studies will be carried&#13;
out.&#13;
6.    Modifications to Project Design and Implementation  Plans.  During Annual&#13;
Project Reviews and the Project Mid-Term Review, there is the opportunity to update&#13;
project targets and discuss changes needed in project design or implementation plans. In&#13;
this context, LBRD and IDB may require that SEEBAC prepare an action plan for the&#13;
Banks' review and approval within two months following the completion of the Project&#13;
Review. SEEBAC will incorporate the changes agreed upon in the Project documents,&#13;
including the Project Operations Manual if warranted. The PCU Coordinator will be&#13;
responsible for organizing the Mid-Term Project Review and ensuring that agreed follow-&#13;
up actions, satisfactory to the Banks, are taken in a timely manner.&#13;

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
SECOND BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Educational Financing: Trends and Projections'&#13;
1.      Overview. The evolution of public expenditure on education in the Dominican Republic&#13;
shows a pattern of decline over the 1980s: public expenditure on education as a share of GDP declined&#13;
from  1.9 to 0.9 percent between 1982 and 1991; and public expenditure on education as a share of total&#13;
public expenditure fell from about 13 percent in 1985 to 5 percent in 1991 (Annex Table 1). These&#13;
levels of public expenditure were very low, as compared with those in other countries in the region&#13;
(Annex Table 2).&#13;
2.      With the onset of the Ten-Year Plan, the Government began to reverse the expenditure trend&#13;
for education. The importance placed on improving public education, especially basic education&#13;
services, is expected to continue over the foreseeable future. The shift is demonstrated in increases in&#13;
salaries for teachers and SEEBAC staff since 1991, and in the share of the discretionary Presidential&#13;
Fund directed to school investments. With GDP conservatively estimated to grow at 3 percent over the&#13;
next five to 10 years, Plan targets for increasing public expenditure on education to 2.9 percent of GDP&#13;
and about 16 percent of total public expenditure by 2000 appear to be reasonable. (Annex Table 1).&#13;

3.    The average share for basic education in public expenditure for education reached a high&#13;
of about 81 percent in 1994 and is expected to level off at about 70 percent by 2005, which is&#13;
appropriate for preschool through grade 8 (Annex Table 3). The allocation of expenditure on&#13;
basic education by type shows a relatively high share for capital expenditure through 1995. This&#13;
is explained by the share of expenditure attibutable to the Presidential Fund. Projections&#13;
incorporate a decreasing demand for such expenditure at the end of the Plan period and beyond,&#13;
when the backlog of major physical requirements will have been met. They also assume&#13;
continuing increases in salary and non-salary incentives for teachers and gradual incorporation of&#13;
off-budget financing into the regular SEEBAC budget.&#13;
4.    Total public expenditure per student (capital and current)in basic education rose by a&#13;
factor of 3 during the period 1990-94 (to about US$102) and is expected to increase by an&#13;
additional 55 percent by 2000 (to US$169) and a further 16 percent by 2005 (to US$196) (Annex&#13;
Table 4). Over the period 1995-2005 enrollment in basic education is expected to grow by&#13;
250,000 (20 percent) as shown below:&#13;
Number of Students&#13;
1995         1.27 million&#13;
2000         1.48 million&#13;
2005         1.52 million&#13;
5.    The Project. The proposed project forms a share of overall Plan expenditures as&#13;
projected through 2000. The incremental recurrent costs incorporated in project financing are&#13;
relatively low, averaging US$2.3 million per year, principally as a result of the manner in which&#13;
these costs are defined. They incorporate mainly operating expenses for the PCU and materials&#13;
for routine maintenance of classrooms. Other high cost components, including educational&#13;
materials, teacher training, the national assessment, construction and rehabilitation of facilities, as&#13;
well as monitoring and evaluation and the management development component (including&#13;
institutional, MIS and community participation support) are considered to be investment items.&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 4&#13;
To sustain financing for project inputs beyond the implementation period an estimated US$12&#13;
million in incremental recurrent financing would be required annually. Annex Table 5 shows that&#13;
during project implementation the project would represent annually from 7 to 14 percent (average&#13;
10 percent) of total expected public expenditure on education and from 9 to 18 percent (average&#13;
14 percent) of expected public education expenditure on basic education. Beginning the year&#13;
after project completion, the incremental financing requirement attributable to project inputs&#13;
would represent 4 and 5 percent, respectively, of public education expenditure and public&#13;
expenditure on basic education.&#13;

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC&#13;
SECOND BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
Economic Benefits of the Project&#13;
1.    Available data permit only general estimates of selected benefits that would accrue&#13;
as a result of expenditures under the Ten-Year Development Plan, of which the project&#13;
forms a share. These estimates of potential economic benefits are presented below.&#13;
2.    During the first half of the Plan period (1991-95), key indicators of efficiency&#13;
within basic education, for student repetition and completion, improved; these indicators&#13;
are targeted to improve further by the end of the Plan period (2000).&#13;
1991            1995             2000&#13;
Repetition (Annual %)              20               13               10&#13;
Completion (% for a cohort         20               45               50&#13;
completing grade 8)&#13;
The changes in repetition and completion rates demonstrate a response to Plan&#13;
expenditure as a whole, indicating improvements in school effectiveness. Data currently&#13;
available do not permit attribution of particular improvements to particular inputs. With&#13;
improved salaries and training, teachers should be providing an improved quality of&#13;
education. Materials are also being provided for students on a regular basis as is school&#13;
nutrition for the rural and urban poor. Classroom facilities and sanitation conditions have&#13;
improved. In line with available research findings, these school inputs help to improve&#13;
both student performance and attendance, and especially for the poor, to mitigate non-&#13;
school factors impinging on participation. The introduction of the national assessment and&#13;
increased involvement of parents at the school level is also expected to increase&#13;
accountability among teachers and school directors, resulting in both quality&#13;
improvements and in gains in efficiency of use of school resources. Over the medium-&#13;
term, the addition of the preschool year to basic education should also have an impact on&#13;
school quality and efficiency by improving student achievement in the early grades where&#13;
repetition is highest.&#13;
3.    Savings from Reduced Repetition. Improvements in school quality are assumed&#13;
to explain a substantial share of the reduction in student repetition achieved and targeted.&#13;
Related reductions in the number of years required to produce a graduate of basic&#13;
education constitute a savings for the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;

Students Enrolled   Students Repeating   Student-Years Saved&#13;
(Grades 1 -_8)*&#13;
1990              948,000            189,600&#13;
1995            1,180,000            153,400               36,200&#13;
2000            1,356,000             135,600               17,800&#13;
* excludes preschool students&#13;
The aggregate savings, based on recurrent cost per student, amounted to about US$4.05&#13;
million per year by 1995 and would rise to US$6.05 million by 2000 (about 3 percent of&#13;
projected expenditure on SEEBAC programs).&#13;
4.    Benefits from Completing Basic Education. Benefits resulting from completion&#13;
of basic education compared with non-completion are represented by additional earnings.&#13;
These benefits, calculated using a rate of return model (Psacharapoulos and Ng) are:&#13;
Private      15 percent (for students completing grade 8 compared&#13;
to those completing grade 4)&#13;
Social       14 percent (for students completing grade 8)&#13;
The benefits would accrue increasingly as the share of students completing basic education&#13;
rises. The earnings differential is of the order of US$23 per month (40 percent) for the&#13;
age group 13-50. The estimated annual benefit would be of the order of US$120 million&#13;
for the cohort completing grade 8 in 2000 (as completion rates increase from 20 percent in&#13;
1992 to 50 percent).&#13;
5.    Other Benerits. Quantified savings from anticipated management improvements&#13;
and from higher employment and productivity rates for graduates of basic education of&#13;
improved quality are not quantified here; and no attempt is made to quantity the benefits&#13;
of community participation. In combination with improved school inputs (e.g., student&#13;
and teacher materials, teacher training), however, the increased local participation of&#13;
parents is expected to significantly improve school effectiveness. Results of a recent pilot&#13;
to monitor teacher and student attendance through parent associations were positive. As&#13;
parents become more involved, they could be expected to create pressure for raising&#13;
school quality and accountability at the school level.&#13;

            Development Project

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Second Basic
            Education Develoment Project will be to: 1) improve the
            quality of basic education; 2) increase enrollment and
            especially completion rates, with priority directed to
            children from low income families; and 3) strengthen
            technical and resource management capabilities for basic
            education. The project components designed to promote
            educational development are: 1) national curriculum reform
            through promotional campaign, curriculum implementation,
            on-going monitoring and evaluation; 2) educational materials
            and resources by providing textbooks, workbooks, and
            teacher's guides, supplementary learning materials,
            classroom materials and supplies, and institutionalization;
            3) human resources development through in-service
            certificate training, in-service advanced training, and
            pre-service training; 4) national student assessment through
            institutional strengthening, improving design and quality of
            basic education, and studies; 5) school nutrition programs
            to include school feeding, micronutrients, deparasitation,
            institutional strengthening, and information, education and
            communication programs; 6) improving school facilities; and
            7) designing a pilot program to support private schools
            assisting low-income populations. The project also includes
            institutional strengthening and staff development for school
            administrators; management information system development;
            and on-going monitoring and evaluation of the project.
