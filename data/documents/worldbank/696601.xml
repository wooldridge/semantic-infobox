SHEEP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (SDP)&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:              The Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
Implementing Agency:    Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF).&#13;
Beneficiaries:         Ministry of Agriculture and Food and participating private farmers and sheep&#13;
breeders.&#13;
Poverty:               Measures to increase sheep and wool productivity, the proposed removal of&#13;
export taxes and improvement in wool and lamb marketing system would have&#13;
considerable impact on raising the income of sheep producers who constitute&#13;
the poorest segment of the rural population.&#13;
Amount:                SDR 7.8 million (US$11.6 million equivalent).&#13;
Terns:                 Standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, including 10 years of grace.&#13;
Commitment Fee:        0.5 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,&#13;
less any waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:       The proceeds of the Bank loan would be passed on to participating Sheep&#13;
Breeders' Associations as grants for technical assistance, training and&#13;
operating expenditures in initial year of operation and on a full cost recovery&#13;
basis in subsequent years.  After the first year, loans to producers'&#13;
associations would bear an interest rate determined on the basis of the&#13;
rediscount rate of the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan and be repayable in no&#13;
more than five years including a grace period of no more than two years.&#13;
Project Financing:     Total project costs are estimated at US$16.8 million equivalent. IDA would&#13;
finance US$11.6 million, or 69 percent of project costs, and 91 percent of&#13;
foreign exchange costs (approximately US$12.7 million). Government would&#13;
contribute US$1.7 million, or about 10 percent of project costs, mainly&#13;
through salaries for incremental local staff.  IFAD  would contribute&#13;
approximately US$3.5 million. IFAD financing would be earmarked for&#13;
supporting the promotion of farmers' organizations, and ATAS (Agricultural&#13;
Training and Advisory Services). On the basis of annual work plans and&#13;
budgets, the PIU would disburse project funds to meet incremental recurrent&#13;
expenses of DLMD and DVS for project activities. In line with its policy to&#13;
promote the development of the private sector, Government is agreeable, in&#13;
principle, to disburse project funds to the KSBA and its affiliates, on a grant&#13;
basis.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
SHEEP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
Agriculture in the Kyrgyz Economy&#13;
1.1    Agriculture is an important sector of the Kyrgyz economy as it accounts for roughly 30 percent&#13;
of GDP and approximately one-third of employment. An additional 10 percent of the labor force is&#13;
employed in industries processing fiber, food, and agricultural by-products. Farm input and service&#13;
enterprises add to the overall impact of agriculture to account for more than 50 percent of GDP.&#13;
Livestock products contribute significantly to the gross value of agricultural output. In 1994, the&#13;
livestock share was estinated at 60 percent of the gross value of agricultural output at 1983 constant&#13;
prices. The importance of livestock production is also reflected in current land use patterns, accounting&#13;
for over 85 percent of agricultural land.&#13;
1.2    About half of the total value of Kyrgyz exports come from the agricultural sector. The mnain&#13;
agricultural export products are wool, tobacco, cotton, and hides and skins which accounted for 90&#13;
percent of agricultural exports. In terms of value, wool is the most important export. There is good&#13;
potential for increasing exports of live lamb and mutton.&#13;
1.3   Irrigation is critical to agricultural production in the country, covering over 80 percent of arable&#13;
land. The main crops grown are wheat, barley, maize, cotton, tobacco, sugar beet, sunflower, potato,&#13;
vegetables, fruits and fodder crops. Winter wheat is the dominant cereal crop, accounting for over 40&#13;
percent of the 624,000 hectares under grain in 1993. Spring barley is the next most important grain crop&#13;
and accounts for about a third of the grain area. The remainder of the grain area is planted with winter&#13;
barley, spring wheat, and maize.&#13;
1.4   Following the breakdown of the Soviet system  in 1990, agricultural output has declined&#13;
consistently. Gross agricultural output fell by 10 percent in 1991, 6 percent in 1992, and 8 percent in&#13;
1993. This trend is expected to be continued in 1996 with a 12 percent decline. Many farmers have&#13;
resorted to subsistence production since marketing systems for both commercial inputs and products have&#13;
virtually collapsed. Trade is increasingly done on a barter basis. The decline in agricultural production&#13;
has affected rural cash incomes which in 1994 fell to less than one-third of their value in 1990. The&#13;
virtual collapse of the marketing system has resulted in extremely low product prices for sheep and wool,&#13;
and low farm profitability. The negative trend in agricultural output and rural cash incomes are due to:&#13;
(a) the virtual collapse of the marketing system following the abolition of the state orders system and the&#13;
inability to quickly develop alternative mnarketing channels; (b) the inability of traditional state marketing&#13;
enterprises to raise operating capital to procure crops as a result of the general credit squeeze in the&#13;
economy; (c) the fragmentation and break-up of traditional trade relations; (d) rapid establishment of&#13;
private property rights and lags in the provision of contractual support services (land, pastures, water and&#13;
tradable goods) and farmn restructuring; (e) the absence of effective support services, including research&#13;
and extension, for the emerging private farming sector; and (f) the current crisis in the agricuitural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
financial system resulting in a severe credit squeeze. More generally, the recent macro-econornic success&#13;
of containing inflation and stabilizing the som have so far failed to stimulate immnediate agricultural&#13;
growth because of these factors.&#13;
1.5    During the Soviet period, agriculture was based on collective farmns, state farms, and household&#13;
plots. There were 195 collective farms and 275 state farms in 1991. In addition to arable land, both&#13;
state and collective farms had grazing rights on identified tracts of pasture to which the animals were&#13;
moved for summer grazing. Prior to 1990, the household sector owned about one-third of the cattle, one-&#13;
fifth of sheep and goats, one-quarter of horses. Recent changes in agricultural policy and structure are&#13;
briefly discussed below.&#13;
Status of Agricultural Reforms&#13;
1.6    A number of fundamental reforms have been initiated to change the policy environment for&#13;
agriculture and its structure. These have included: (a) changes in the state procurement system to&#13;
liberalize both the pricing and marketing systems, though many former state farms remain closely&#13;
attached to processing enterprises; (b) privatization of state-owned enterprises involved in agricultural&#13;
marketing and processing; and (c) land reform and farm restructuring to forn the basis for private sector&#13;
farming. The Government is committed, in principle, to the implementation of these reforms. At the&#13;
same time, efforts to restructure Government institutions, especially the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Food, to provide support services to private farmers and to facilitate the sector's transition to a market&#13;
economy are yet to be implemented.&#13;
1.7    Refonns in the State Procurement System. The traditional marketing system, based on state&#13;
orders at fixed prices administered by state enterprises, is in the process of being replaced by market-&#13;
based exchange. State orders have been replaced by domestic supply agreements under which producers&#13;
contract to deliver fixed quantities to agents of the state at negotiated prices. After fulfillment of such&#13;
agreements, producers are free to sell the balance on terms and conditions dictated by a free market.&#13;
Whilst this remains an important step towards liberalization, it still falls short of a competitive market&#13;
because of the prevalence of monopsonistic state buying agencies. Privatization of these agencies is&#13;
critical to the development of competitive markets in the future. Horticultural products, potatoes, and&#13;
livestock are free of any obligatory deliveries. Domestic supply agreements are, however, covering a&#13;
declining share of commodity trade because state agents lack operating capital to purchase the&#13;
commodities from producers. Export taxes, trade margin ceilings, and licenses have been abolished for&#13;
all commodities.&#13;
1.8    Prices of inputs, like imported fertilizers and agro-chemicals, have been liberalized and are now&#13;
based on world market prices, though bilateral aid has produced subsidies for certain inputs. Given that&#13;
domestic output prices are still depressed compared to world market prices, especially for wool, input-&#13;
output price ratios have risen substantially. This, in combination with the complete absence of&#13;
agricultural credit, has negatively affected input use. This, in turn, is contributing to the stagnation or&#13;
even decline of the yields of the most important commodities observed over the last couple of years.&#13;
1.9    The Government has initiated programs to de-monopolize and privatize state-owned enterprises&#13;
involved in agricultural marketing and processing. Nevertheless, the majority of these still retain&#13;
significant shareholdings (and informal links) by Government with little corporate autonomy, and&#13;
alternative marketing channels are developing very slowly. The generally small size of the Kyrgyz&#13;
economy remains an obstacle to the development of competitive marketing channels. Kyrgyz Gemish,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
involved in the processing of fruits and vegetables, and Kyrgyz Agro-Chemistry, involved in handling&#13;
agricultural inputs, are examples of recently created joint stock companies. The Bread Products&#13;
Enterprise and Kyrgyz Tamak-Ash, involved in food processing have been demonopolized and are in the&#13;
process of being privatized. Besides these traditional mnarketing agencies, a few new companies like&#13;
Kyrgyzagropromimpex, Kyrgyz Agro-Invest, and the Commercial Information Agency Kyrgyzstan are&#13;
currently trying to establish themselves as intermediaries in the marketing of agricultural products.&#13;
1.10   Land Reform and Farm Restructuring. Up to date privatization of state and collective farms&#13;
has taken a variety of forms which include the emergence of: (a) private peasant farms (21084); (b)&#13;
agricultural production cooperatives (191); (c) associations of peasant farms (123); (d) joint stock&#13;
companies (9); and (e) small enterprises (120). Land reform and farm restructuring was initiated in 1991&#13;
and explicitly provided opportunities for privatization of state and collective farms on the basis of the&#13;
share system commonly used in other FSU countries. However, the initial program was not very&#13;
successful. Too much emphasis was placed on the rapid transfer of herds to the household sector without&#13;
commensurate transfer, or privatization, of land; too little emphasis was placed on the experience of&#13;
potential lessees in agriculture, and on the effect of devolution on the operational efficiency of specialized&#13;
units, such as breeding farms. The lack of a transparent farm restructuring policy, including ways of how&#13;
to address the increasing amounts of debt owed by state and collective farms, are other impediments&#13;
which are still acting against the spirit of the government's policy of privatization. More importantly,&#13;
no institutional measures have been introduced to provide private farmers with technical assistance,&#13;
extension, and other support services. A Presidential Decree in February 1994, followed by a&#13;
Government Directive in March, have rekindled the process of establishing family land holdings and&#13;
private farming. These provide for privatization and restructuring of state and collective farms.&#13;
Individual landholders would be issued with a 49 year lease, renewable at expiration, while grazing&#13;
resources would be leased to individuals or groups for a definite period. Government has also drafted&#13;
a Land Code to codify these rights into law. The responsibility to actually implement these decrees has&#13;
been shifted from the State Property Fund to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in collaboration with&#13;
the local state administrations and rural committees for land and agrarian reform. In recent months,&#13;
privatization of state and collective farms has accelerated, giving rise to the establishunent of numerous&#13;
private small farms and livestock herds/flocks. By the end of 1995, it is estimated that private farms&#13;
accounted for nearly 50 percent of all arable land held by agricultural enterprises. The remainder was&#13;
still in the hands of state and collective farms.&#13;
1.11  In regard to livestock the Government has announced its intention to privatize all State sheep&#13;
breeding farms over the next twelve months, with the government retaining a 25 percent share holding.&#13;
At the same time, it is also Government's intention to privatize most of the grazing resources through&#13;
leasing arrangements with individual or cooperative farms. In response, sheep farmers are now&#13;
evaluating the choice between preserving sheep flock structures in either a co-operative or joint stock&#13;
entity or divesting the flocks into smaller sized units.&#13;
1.12   The Role of Government. The sector's transition towards a market-economy also requires a&#13;
change in the functions and role of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food and its affiliated (research)&#13;
institutes. These continue to be directed at agricultural production, marketing and processing via state&#13;
enterprises and collective farms. The diminished role of government in a market economy and the&#13;
current fiscal constraints argue in favor of a smaller, service oriented Ministry focusing exclusively on&#13;
the legitimate tasks of the public sector. These would include sector policy analysis and formulation;&#13;
design and implementation of land reform and farm restructuring programs; support for agricultural&#13;
research, extension and training; and market infrastructure development. Current production, processing,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
marketing, and input supply functions of the Ministry should be privatized. The oblast and district level&#13;
agricultural departments should be redefined as units offering professional advisory services, and&#13;
marketing information and should be explicitly excluded from administrative interference in production&#13;
or marketing by farmers.&#13;
The Sheep Industry&#13;
1.13   Structural Trends in the Sheep Industry. This section reviews the structure of the sheep and&#13;
wool industry in recent years, focusing on: sheep inventory, breeds, types of sheep holdings, ownership&#13;
categories, management systems, feed resource, animal health, sheep and wool productivity, sheep and&#13;
mutton output, marketing, and support services. In this review, emphasis is placed on identifying&#13;
problems that are constraining or are likely to constrain the performance of the sub-sector.&#13;
1.14   Sheep Flock Size and Composition. Total livestock units expressed in sheep equivalents (sheep,&#13;
cattle, horses) in the Kyrgyz Republic increased from 7.5 million in 1940 to 12.4 million in 1960 and&#13;
19.7 million in 1990. The total number of sheep increased from 2.3 million in 1940 (30 percent share&#13;
of total livestock units) to 6.3 million in 1960 (51 percent share) and 10.5 million (53 percent share) in&#13;
1990 before reducing to 8.8 million in 1993 and an estimated 7 million by January 1995 (goats account&#13;
for about 2.5 percent of these numbers). It is anticipated that the national sheep flock will decline to&#13;
between 5 and 6 million by the end of 1995. Relatively high death rates (+ 10 percent/year), low&#13;
lambing rates (86 percent), and high off-take rates propelled by high consumption of sheep meat will&#13;
jointly lead to further decline in the flock. This will continue until prices of mutton and wool rise&#13;
sufficiently to create the incentives for flock rebuilding. The development of a new and efficient lamb&#13;
and wool marketing system will be a prerequisite for this. The proposed project would support the&#13;
development of such a marketing system.&#13;
1.15   Sheep Breeds.  All three sheep breeds in the country are classified as wool breeds. These&#13;
consist of the Kyrgyz Fine Wool breed (91 percent of the flock), the Tian Shan breed (7 percent), and&#13;
the Alai semi-coarse wool breed (2 percent). These breeds have adapted well to the agro-ecological&#13;
environment for which they were bred. The fine wool breed were based almost exclusively on state and&#13;
collective farms where rigid breeding and selection procedures were maintained. This is, however,&#13;
rapidly breaking down with the privatization of state and collective farms, accompanied by distribution&#13;
of sheep to private owners who hold them in smaller flocks. The breeds were developed at state sheep&#13;
breeding plants some years ago by using the local sheep as a base and initially crossing with imported&#13;
breeds. This crossbreeding was followed by continued selection to improve specific performance traits&#13;
and finally a classification or registration scheme was evolved to identify elite and less superior sheep.&#13;
Semen from superior rams, through artificial insemination (Al), has been the predominant method of&#13;
mating. However, private sheep owners are now relying more on natural mating methods because of the&#13;
high fee charged for AI service relative to the low profitability of sheep and wool production. This shift&#13;
away from Al by most private producers has the risk of spreading some diseases by unhealthy rams. In&#13;
addition, breeding is unregulated both in respect of strain and breed and this is likely to lead to decreasing&#13;
wool quality and yield. With the decline of the AI service, the control of indiscriminate breeding of&#13;
sheep is necessary. This could be done through the introduction of certification and registration of rams&#13;
(flock book registration) via producers' associations by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF).&#13;
Owing to the virtual collapse of the wool marketing system in the country, contrasted by a relatively&#13;
strong local demand for mutton, many private sheep breeders are reported to prefer using rams of a meat&#13;
breed, particularly the Altai. This puts the wool breeding work of several years at risk, though this is&#13;
likely to be a transitional phenomenon.  Nevertheless, it poses a strategic dilemma in the future&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
development of the industry: should investment in the industry be geared toward the production of lamb&#13;
production or maintenance and expansion of the wool genotypes? Ultimately, the choice between these&#13;
two options will be made by the farmer. Meanwhile, it is important that Government control breeding&#13;
through licensing of rams and providing appropriate breeding stock to farmers for both purposes.&#13;
Consequently, the elite flocks and superior genotypes that have been developed over the years for both&#13;
purposes should be maintained. The proposed project would support the above measures and restore the&#13;
relative profitability of wool production, particularly for export.&#13;
1.16   Types of Sheep Holdings. Prior to 1991, sheep breeding and production was mainly organized&#13;
around state and collective farms, including state sheep breeding plants and farms. The former have been&#13;
critical in developing superior sheep stocks for distribution to state and collective farms. With the&#13;
privatization of these state plants and farms, new types of livestock farming enterprises have emerged.&#13;
The situation is, however, not entirely clear since many state enterprises have been nominally privatized&#13;
without undergoing real changes in essence or structure. Moreover, the process of privatization and farm&#13;
restructuring is still going on. In addition to the well known state and collective farns that are within&#13;
the public sector, there are currently four types of sheep farming within the private sector. Following&#13;
the Soviet legacy, most of these farms are mixed (i.e., they produce both livestock and crops). They&#13;
consist of: (a) Family Farm, averaging 10 hectares with rights to natural grazing, is rented and operated&#13;
by one family. The head of the family makes most of the management decisions in consultation with the&#13;
family. Typically, the lease on the farm is registered and arises from the dissolution of a state or&#13;
collective farm. The independence of this type of farm is often limited by collective management of farm&#13;
machinery, irrigation water, and natural grazing resource; (b) Peasant Livestock Owner is often a&#13;
member of a state or collective farm that has decided to restructure by privatizing the ownership of&#13;
livestock (especially sheep), without distributing arable land. He receives livestock which he maintains&#13;
on common natural pastures (formerly belonging to the state or collective farm), on his household plot,&#13;
and purchased feed. Subject to the same management decision constraints faced by the family farm&#13;
holder, he makes management decisions in respect of his livestock. On the other hand, he continues to&#13;
be a mere laborer as far as crop production is concemed; (c) Production Cooperative Farm arises when&#13;
a small number (up to 10) of workers of a dissolving state or collective farm pool their land and livestock&#13;
shares to form a single farm unit under joint management, usually led by one dominant individual. The&#13;
unit may operate as a joint stock company farm. The sheep are managed jointly and share the same&#13;
management decision constraints as other types of famis; and (d) Independent Cooperative Farm derives&#13;
from a dissolution of a state or collective farm, where the majority of workers decide to continue&#13;
operating the farm enterprise together under, quite often, the same management. The farm may operate&#13;
as a joint stock farm enterprise. This fann differs from its predecessor in that it is no longer subject to&#13;
state or oblast administration orders or directives in its management decision making and has discretion&#13;
in the use of its operating surplus. Sheep continue to be managed jointly on the farm's leased natural&#13;
pasture, fodder, and purchased feed. At the end of 1994, it was estimated that the national sheep flock&#13;
was distributed as follows among the various types of farms: public sector farms (46 percent),&#13;
independent cooperative farms (11 percent), and small-scale private farms (43 percent). Small-scale&#13;
private farms consist of family farm, peasant livestock owners, and production cooperative farms. The&#13;
share of small-scale private farms is highest in the major sheep producing regions (ranging between 54&#13;
percent in Issyk-Kul and 44 percent in Osh), except in Naryn (37 percent). The share of small-scale&#13;
private farms in the national sheep flock is increasing rapidly under the ongoing land reform and farm&#13;
restructuring program of the Govermment. The primary target group of the proposed project would be&#13;
all sheep farms and producers in the private sector. State and collective farms that are legacies of the&#13;
Soviet system would not be eligible for participation in the proposed project, except those designated for&#13;
sheep breeding and research activities under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.17   Private Farmers' Associations. The transition of the sheep industry would greatly benefit from&#13;
the development of a strong network of farmers' associations or groups. These associations are being&#13;
established under the EU (TACIS) Livestock Project, mainly in Talas and Naryn regions, as multi-&#13;
purpose service cooperatives. They differ from the production cooperatives in that they provide services&#13;
to private farms emerging from the dissolution of state or collective farms. Usually, the ex-workers of&#13;
a state or collective farm retain the former management to run the service association for them, while&#13;
they run their private farms independently. The services provided include: input supply (especially fuel&#13;
and oil), marketing of produce (mainly through barter of produce for inputs), machinery services, credit,&#13;
water regulation, and common pasture management regulation. Most of these associations are affiliated&#13;
to Dyikanardo, a national apex farmers' association, through which the Government channeled&#13;
concessional credit to farmers in 1994. Dyikanardo has, however, transformed itself into a political&#13;
movement and participated in the 1995 general elections. Nevertheless, there is need to strengthen the&#13;
grassroots associations, through technical and financial assistance, to enable them to provide support&#13;
services to members, which, in addition to the above activities, should include herd/flock book&#13;
registration and extension service. The proposed project would support the establishment of sheep&#13;
farmers' associations which may eventually become multi-purpose to cover activities related to other&#13;
livestock and crops.&#13;
1.18   Sheep Management System. The annual cycle of sheep management is similar throughout the&#13;
year, with seasonal variations dictated by altitude and the severity of winter. Lambs are born during&#13;
February-March, coinciding with the shearing period. During this period, winter feeding is predominant&#13;
until it is succeeded by spring grazing in low lands or foothills as snow disappears in May. As spring&#13;
progresses into summer, the flocks are moved progressively to graze on high altitude pastures (up to 3500&#13;
m). The shepherds and their families accompany them. With the approach of winter, the flocks descend&#13;
to lower fall pastures in September and October. They also graze the stubble and forage crops at this&#13;
time, which flushes the ewes in preparation for service. During winter (November-February), sheep are&#13;
housed in "kashara" (sheds). Winter feed comprises hay, straw, and ground barley.&#13;
1.19   Animal Health. During the Soviet regime, the control of diseases was relatively easy. Since&#13;
flocks are now in private hands and they graze freely over extensive areas, some disease outbreaks are&#13;
imminent, particularly brucellosis. The incidence of brucellosis in sheep increased from 1 percent in&#13;
1992 to 1.8 percent in 1993. A brucellosis eradication program has been started, but it suffers from lack&#13;
of resources and staff. In addition, it was designed for prior privatization situation, during which the&#13;
majority of sheep were concentrated in state and collective farms. Today, some private sheep owners&#13;
are not cooperating in diagnostic services provided by the state. In the absence of compensation for sheep&#13;
slaughtered or disposed of after testing positive, farmers have little incentive to cooperate. Disease&#13;
control should be made more effective by adopting a strategy of improved diagnosis, vaccine&#13;
development, and testing for brucellosis in coordination with other countries in the region. In addition&#13;
the participation of private veterinary practitioners should be encouraged and supported. Private farmers&#13;
should be required, through their farmers' organizations, to participate in public campaigns of disease&#13;
control. Internal and external parasites are also a major source of loss.&#13;
1.20   Sheep and Wool Productivity and Production.  Average productivity in sheep and wool has&#13;
consistently declined since 1990. The average body weight of sheep has dropped from 36 to 31 kg over&#13;
the period. The average greasy fleece yield per sheep declined from 3.8 to 3.7 kg over the same period.&#13;
Wool yields have declined more in the state and collective farms, dropping from an average of 3.2 to 2.9&#13;
kg per sheep over the same period. The decline in wool yield is continuing and both wool yield and&#13;
quality are being adversely affected by inadequate winter feeding. The dilution of the fine wool&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
genotype, resulting from the decline in sheep breeding control, is expected to progressively reduce the&#13;
yields and quality of wool. In addition, private farmers have a preference for breeding for bigger&#13;
carcasses, resulting in lower wool yield. Total production of mutton has increased from 77,000 tons&#13;
(dressed weight) in 1990 to 82,000 tons in 1993, reflecting an increasing off-take rate via increased&#13;
slaughter. This is continuing and is likely to reduce the size of the flock further. On the contrary, the&#13;
production of wool has fallen from 39,000 tons (greasy weight) in 1990 to 25,000 tons in 1993.&#13;
Declining wool yields suggest that total wool production will continue to fall.&#13;
1.21   Despite the fall in production, wool remains an important product for the Kyrgyz economy, with&#13;
exports of wool and wool products constituting the largest source of foreign earnings. In 1994 wool&#13;
production was equivalent to about 20,700 ton (greasy weight), valued domestically at 134 million som&#13;
(US$12.7 million). At world prices, and in a competitive marketing environment, the value of Kyrgyz&#13;
wool production could be doubled. The Kyrgyz Republic accounts for about 10 percent of wool&#13;
production and trade in the Former Soviet Union and 1 percent of global wool production. The sub-&#13;
sector is in the fore-front of privatization efforts affecting the agricultural sector.&#13;
1.22   Livestock Institutions. The principal institutions servicing the livestock sub-sector are the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) and its affiliated institutes. MAF has two departments serving&#13;
the sub-sector: the Department of Livestock Management and Development (DLMD) and Department of&#13;
Veterinary Services (DVS). The former is responsible for overseeing sound animnal breeding, husbandry&#13;
and nutrition practices in state and collective farms, including research institutes. DLMD has 17&#13;
professional staff in three sections each dealing with cattle and dairy breeding, sheep breeding, and&#13;
pedigree inspection. The latter two sections would be involved in the implementation of the proposed&#13;
project. The Livestock Institute (LI) has two departments each for animal breeding and research. The&#13;
LI has been recently reorganized into two corporate entities: "Asyl-Mal" and "Kerneej". The "Asyl-&#13;
Mal", operated as a public joint stock company, maintains 16 livestock breeding farms which are&#13;
responsible for progeny recording and selection of sires for artificial insemination (AT). It has 7 sheep&#13;
breeding farms, of which 5 farms are for fine wool breeds, and 2 farms for Tian Shan and Alai breed.&#13;
These farms are responsible for storage and distribution of semen and for the supply of improved&#13;
breeding stocks. The "Kerneej" carries out livestock research and is wholly state-owned. It is engaged&#13;
in several research programs, including breeding improvement and selection, biotechnology, genetics,&#13;
forage utilization, and mechanization of livestock production. The Scientific Industrial Enterprise (SIE)&#13;
formally known as the Pasture Institute is responsible for research in both natural pastures and cultivated&#13;
forage production. All breeding and research institutes are operating on shoe-string budgets and have&#13;
substantially curtailed their programn activities. Staff attrition has been considerable with the recent&#13;
exodus of non-Kyrgyz ethnic residents. Neither MAF nor its institutes are currently organized to or&#13;
capable of providing support services to the emerging private fanning sector. All of them are still&#13;
organized to issue directives, control the supply of inputs, and direct marketing and processing. MAF&#13;
and its institutes are being reorganized to become capable of providing support services to private farms&#13;
and implementing the land and agrarian reforms. The proposed project would initiate the reorganization&#13;
of MAF's departments and institutes dealing with livestock development. This would be done in&#13;
compliance with the proposed reorganization of MAF that will be implemented under the proposed&#13;
Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP).&#13;
1.23   Potential of the Industry. Despite the recent decline in sheep and wool productivity and the&#13;
depressed price of Kyrgyz wool compared to world market levels, there exists significant potential to&#13;
increase farm profitability in the sub-sector. Given the country's grazing resource, harsh climatic&#13;
environmnent, and long distance from potential international markets, this potential lies in wool and lamb&#13;
production rather than mutton production.  There are significant opportunities to increase wool&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
productivity and improve its quality to fetch price premiums on the international market. Potential wool&#13;
productivity gains (by increasing greasy wool yields from the 3.5 kg/sheep average over the last 5 years)&#13;
are estimated at 30 percent, while price increases of Kyrgyz wool could exceed 100 percent. Further&#13;
sources of increased productivity exist in the form of higher lambing percentages, lower death rates and&#13;
increased clean wool yields. The Kyrgyz wool industry has important natural advantages in its close&#13;
proximity to major markets in Russia and China, with potential clients in Eastern Europe. However,&#13;
much of this advantage is dissipated by inefficient production, handling, grading, and lack of marketing&#13;
regulations of international standard. It also has the capacity to produce high quality wool and, most&#13;
importantly, it has low labor costs. The wool processing industry is considered to have significant&#13;
potential in increasing both capacity utilization rates and capacity. In this connection, the country has&#13;
the potential to rival China which is emerging as a major finishing center for wool products for Japanese&#13;
and Korean textile firms because of its low labor costs. The country has also good potential to produce&#13;
lamb for the export to the Arabian Gulf States and to compete with the traditional lamb suppliers&#13;
(Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina) to the market. This potential has been neglected&#13;
in the past because the sheep industry's policy focus during the Soviet regime was to produce wool. The&#13;
proposed project would seek to make maximum use of this potential and to make the entire sheep industry&#13;
export-oriented. However, to realize this potential, specific problems faced by the sheep and wool sub-&#13;
sector, including insufficient pasture resource management, poor sheep husbandry practices, and&#13;
inefficient wool marketing and quality control system have to be resolved. The proposed project has been&#13;
designed to address these problems. In order to respond to these problems through market solutions, the&#13;
pivotal role of the private sector in managing the subsector's transition has been underscored in the&#13;
proposed project. However, the development of the private sector in the subsector would require: (a)&#13;
the establishment of adequate support services, including extension and credit; (b) establishment of wool&#13;
marketing regulations, based on international standards, to enhance wool quality control and&#13;
marketability; and (c) promotion of formation of grassroots farmers organizations, operating on self-help&#13;
and self-accountability, by the state to spearhead the subsector's response to continually changing market&#13;
requirements.&#13;
1.24   Pasture Resources. The pasture area of approximately 8.8 million hectares is supplemented by&#13;
forage areas of some 600,000 hectares (of which 400,000 hectares is irrigated alfalfa and other legumes).&#13;
In this respect, the Kyrgyz Republic appears to have a considerable grazing resource, suggesting&#13;
comparative advantage in extensive livestock production. However, the past policy that focused solely&#13;
at increasing livestock numbers has resulted in considerable degradation of the resource. Years of&#13;
overgrazing have reduced the productivity of summer, spring/fall, and winter pastures over the past 30&#13;
years, from 639 to 414 kg/ha, 465 to 301 kg/ha, and 297 to 93 kg/ha respectively. As a result of&#13;
degradation of winter pastures and a continued reliance on wool production from weathers (male&#13;
castrates) kept over winter, the Kyrgyz Republic has become reliant on relatively high-cost supplemental&#13;
feeding for four to five months of the year. In 1987, at the peak of the livestock herd and of feed&#13;
consumption, the amount of grain used for feed was approximately twice that used for food. This was&#13;
unsustainable and feed imports have virtually disappeared, forcing producers to reduce considerably their&#13;
flock sizes.&#13;
1.25   Sheep graze natural pastures during March-October. Winter pastures supplement winter rations&#13;
based on straw, lucerne/saifoin hay, silage, and barley. These winter feeds are, however, rarely&#13;
sufficient and availability of winter grazing is determined by climate, weather, and pasture condition&#13;
(which is generally overgrazed and poor).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1.26   To reduce the problem of overgrazing a number of actions have been done or are required in&#13;
future. Already the sheep flock size has been reduced substantially to the current estimate of 7 million.&#13;
To allow for a sustainable utilization of current pasture resources, sheep flock numbers should be&#13;
maintained at the current level. This requires a change in the grazing management and stocking rate by&#13;
stopping to equate 100 percent utilization of feed on offer with maximum efficiency and profitability.&#13;
Experience elsewhere in the world (e.g., Australia) suggests that maximum profit and maximum&#13;
sustainability of pastures almost always occur when less than 50 percent of the total pasture on offer is&#13;
utilized. The reduction in sheep flock size is being accompanied by a change in the flock structure.&#13;
First, the ongoing privatization of state and collective farms has considerably reduced the flock sizes.&#13;
Second, reduced numbers of weathers during winter would save scarce winter pastures and reduce the&#13;
demand for imported feed. There should be increased emphasis on younger sheep production from more&#13;
abundant summer pastures. The average yield of both hay meadows and irrigated alfalfa is very low.&#13;
This could be increased by the introduction of appropriate high altitude-adapted legumes in hay meadows&#13;
and by the improvement of management and introduction of new varieties in irrigated alfalfa fields.&#13;
These practices need to be complemented by more efficient use of concentrate feeds in winter.&#13;
1.27   Despite these shifts towards a sustainable level of sheep production, the current uncertainties&#13;
surrounding property rights of agricultural land and grazing resources have created a situation in which&#13;
producers may seek security in livestock numbers rather than land. Clearly defined and accepted property&#13;
and grazing rights, supported by an effective pasture monitoring system taking into consideration land&#13;
use capabilities, would facilitate stabilization of the flock size at optimal levels. Similarly, increases in&#13;
the use of yield-enhancing inputs are necessary to improve the productivity of fodder crops. But this,&#13;
in turn, depends on reforms to improve the incentive structure, particularly corrections to the distorted&#13;
input-output price ratios.                                  ,&#13;
1.28   Sheep and Wool Processing and Marketing.   The Kyrgyz Republic accounts for about 10&#13;
percent of wool production in the Former Soviet Union and 1 percent of world wool production. Over&#13;
75 percent of wool produced in the Kyrgyz Republic is classified as "fine wool" with a fine fiber diameter&#13;
of less than 25 micron. The main source of this fine wool is the Kyrgyzstaia Fine-wool breed, a&#13;
derivative of the Australian Merino. In general, however, the wool classified as "fine wool" in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic would be classified as medium to strong in Australia.&#13;
1.29  In the past, over 95 percent of greasy wool has been processed further into scoured wool in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic and over 50 percent of scoured wool processed further into yarn, cloth and garments,&#13;
most of which is exported to other members of the FSU. The main importers of scoured wool are&#13;
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakstan, Azerbaijan and Lithuania. More recently, however, an increased&#13;
amount of greasy wool is being consigned directly to China, Russia and Turkey. The major deficiencies&#13;
in the overall production, marketing and processing chain are: (a) lack of effective greasy wool marketing&#13;
infrastructure, to carry out wool testing, wool selling, and information and communication tasks; (b)&#13;
historical and continuing bias against research into wool marketing and processing problems and&#13;
opportunities; (c) poor control of quality in classing, preparation of wool for sale, handling and storage;&#13;
(d) inefficient local processing industry; and (e) poor understanding of the main profit variables at the&#13;
farm level. The underlying causes for these deficiencies include: (a) government's ownership of&#13;
production and processing facilities which reduced the need for marketing facilities and support services&#13;
at the greasy wool level; (b) the centralized concentration of wool research in Russia; and (c) extreme&#13;
dependence of Kyrgyz wool processors on traditional markets in the FSU where absence of price&#13;
premiums for high quality wool failed to provide the incentives to fully exploit the economic benefits&#13;
associated with high quality wool production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
1.30   As a result of these imperfections, greasy wool prices are on average at least US$1.00 per kg&#13;
(clean basis) lower than world market prices. Given current production levels this translates to a gross&#13;
loss in farm income of about US$10.8 million. The discounts tend to be higher for better quality wool&#13;
(in excess of US$2 per kg) and lower for poor quality wool. At the local level there is little knowledge&#13;
of world market prices for different types of wool. The inefficiencies in the local processing industry&#13;
contribute further to the low price of Kyrgyz wool as their capacity to pay world market prices for greasy&#13;
wool has been eroded through high processing costs.&#13;
1.31   Slaughter and veterinary controls are poor and limit the acceptability of mutton and live animal&#13;
exports in international markets. Nevertheless, during 1993-94, exports of chilled mutton carcasses were&#13;
made to the Middle East. There are no formal live animal markets in the country. However, sheep are&#13;
offered fo. sale in markets in the southern parts of the country. Prospects for lamb exports to the Middle&#13;
East appear quite favorable, provided production and market efficiency in the Kyrgyz sheep industry can&#13;
be initiated and sustained. These would be introduced under the proposed project. Lamb production&#13;
efficiency would be considerably improved (tables 6.1a - 6.1d) and a new lamb marketing system for&#13;
exports to the Middle East would be established under the proposed project. Accordingly, lamb&#13;
production for export would become the mainstay of the country's sheep industry in terms of foreign&#13;
exchange earnings (table 6.1). Existing lamb prices in the Middle East market are considerably higher&#13;
than those assumed for the calculation of the project's economic rate of return (table 6.1). For example,&#13;
live weight p.ices fcr lamb averaged US$1.50 per kilo in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States during 1995.&#13;
This would imply a marketing margin of $0.70 per kilo as the current domestic farmgate price is $0.80&#13;
per kilo.&#13;
1.32   To fully exploit the potential of the wool industry, the development of an internationally&#13;
competitive wool marketing infrastructure, controlled and owned by the private producers, is of&#13;
paramount importance. This development would include: (a) enhancement of wool quality control with&#13;
the aim of achieving more differentiated wool types for high price premium segments of the market; (b)&#13;
establishment of a greasy wool testing system, initially contracted to foreign laboratories, a greasy wool&#13;
marketing center and an associated information system; and (c) improvement of the classification and&#13;
grading of greasy wool at village and regional wool stores. The Kyrgyz wool processing sector is also&#13;
an important source of demand for greasy wool produced in the country. Unless the efficiency of the&#13;
local scouring industry is significantly improved, this will remain an important constraint on greasy wool&#13;
prices and international buyers will continue shipping greasy wool to lower cost scouring locations. This&#13;
project is not addressing the problems of the wool processing sector, which is currently undergoing&#13;
privatization and restructuring under the Government program for economic reform, supported by other&#13;
Bank operations.&#13;
1.33   Support Services.  In addition to the development of marketing infrastructure, the success of&#13;
privatization in mobilizing private resources depends critically, on the concomitant development of&#13;
suitable support services to the private sector. The latter includes both extension services and a veterinary&#13;
regulatory framework (vector control, veterinary surveillance, quarantine etc.). At present, there is little&#13;
evidence for dissemination of technical/managerial information from government to all types of sheep-&#13;
owners. There is a need for sheep producers, many of whom are new managers/sole operators, to&#13;
possess all available information that will assist in improving productivity, and introducing new&#13;
technologies. In this process, there is a need to move away from the current production-driven focus of&#13;
the state towards increased provision of support services to private farmers.&#13;

II. BANK LENDING EXPERENCE AND SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
Bank's Lending Strategy for Agriculture&#13;
2.1    The Bank, through an Agricultural Sector Review (1994), is helping the Government in its design&#13;
of structural and sectoral reforms and the identification of investment opportunities to facilitate the&#13;
transition to a market economy in the agricultural sector. The review identified five areas for policy&#13;
reform: demonopolization and privatization of state agribusiness enterprises; transfer of agricultural land&#13;
and farm assets to provide ownership; adoption of appropriate pricing and marketing structure; a&#13;
diminished and supporting role for the state in agriculture; and development of an appropriate rural&#13;
financial system to serve private farming and rural enterprises. These recommendations were endorsed&#13;
by a Bank/Government sponsored Agricultural Conference held in November 1994. Within the context&#13;
of structural reforms, agriculture is considered vital for contributing to the Governmnent's broad&#13;
objectives, which include sustainable economic growth, poverty reduction, and employment creation.&#13;
2.2    The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy as discussed by the Board&#13;
of Directors during the presentation of the Agricultural Privatization and Enterprise Adjustment Credit&#13;
(APEAC) on June 28, 1995. To achieve the CAS objectives, Bank Group financial and technical&#13;
assistance will be selectively focused on four areas: continued adjustment-lending; agricultural/natural&#13;
resource management; energy; and social sectors. Growth recovery in the agricultural sector is a critical&#13;
element of IDA's assistance program for growth and poverty reduction. Within the CAS framework,&#13;
the Bank's assistance strategy for the sector consists of policy-based lending operations in support of&#13;
structural reforms and investment lending operations in support of sectoral investments. Operations in&#13;
support of structural reforms, which are currently under implementation or preparation, and have&#13;
relevance for the agricultural sector include: (a) the TA component of the Rehabilitation Credit, which&#13;
supports the development and implementation of policy change and privatization of agro-enterprises; (b)&#13;
the recently approved Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC), which seeks to&#13;
liberalize trade policies and the price system; and to improve the regulatory framnework for private sector&#13;
development; (c) the Agricultural Privatization and Enterprise Adjustment Credit (APEAC) aims at&#13;
deepening the market and pricing liberalization in agriculture and the development of competitive markets&#13;
through privatization and private sector development; and (d) the availability of an Institutional&#13;
Development Fund (IDF) grant to facilitate the implementation of Government's Land Reform and Farm&#13;
Restructuring efforts. Building on the policy framework established under these operations, the proposed&#13;
project would contribute to the emergence of an internationally comnpetitive sheep industry, increase&#13;
incomes of sheep producers, generate increased foreign exchange earnings, and foster sustainable&#13;
management of the country's pasture resources.&#13;
2.3    The Bank's sector work has identified a number of investment priorities for the agricultural&#13;
sector. These include: (a) the provision of support services to private and restructured farms consisting&#13;
of technical advisory services, market information, land registration and titling services; (b) agricultural&#13;
research to produce new technologies (mainly through adaptation) in well prioritized areas; (c) animal&#13;
production and health to strengthen public support services to private livestock producers; (d) irrigation&#13;
rehabilitation to provide for the management and maintenance of water within private farms and to&#13;
finance maintenance and operations of the existing irrigation system; (e) rural roads rehabilitation to&#13;
provide for the management and maintenance of the existing network of rural roads; and (f) restructuring&#13;
and improvement of the rural financial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.4    Besides dealing with agricultural policies under the APEAC, the Bank has decided to initially&#13;
focus on three investment operations which include the Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP), a&#13;
Rural Finance Project and the Sheep Development Project (SDP). The ASSP aims at the establishment&#13;
of support services for the emerging private sector, which are considered crucial for the success of&#13;
privatization efforts in the sector. In this process it will restructure the Ministry of Agriculture and Food&#13;
to reflect its proper role and functions in a market economy context. The Rural Finance Project will&#13;
support the development and implementation of a durable system of financing farm and other rural&#13;
activities. The SDP focuses on the sheep sub-sector because of its current importance, its high potential&#13;
for future growth in terms of both productivity and profitability, its impact on poverty alleviation, and&#13;
the relatively high proportion of private sector production. The Bank's involvement in donor coordination&#13;
efforts is expected to generate interest from other donor agencies to include some of the above mentioned&#13;
investment priorities in their support programs.&#13;
2.5    The proposed Sheep Development Project is the first investment lending operation in support of&#13;
reforms in an important agricultural sub-sector, with substantial potential and a leading role in the&#13;
implementation of privatization efforts. The sheep sector is important because of the large sheep herd&#13;
and the potential in the sector for increasing production and exports of meat and wool and raising the&#13;
income of low income farmers. Based on findings of the Agricultural Sector Review, which was&#13;
completed in July 1994, it was concluded that the sub-sector faces serious problems of declining sheep&#13;
and wool productivity and low prices of Kyrgyz wool compared to world market levels which are&#13;
attributed to a wide range of factors including inadequate sheep husbandry practices and disease control,&#13;
insufficient pasture resource management, existing constraints in wool marketing, and the absence of&#13;
effective support services to the emerging private farming sector. The project will help create the&#13;
research and extension institutions and private farmers' organizations necessary for the development of&#13;
an efficient, competitive and financially self-sustainable sheep industry.  More specifically, these&#13;
institutional reforms and critical investments include: (a) the formation of grassroots farmers'&#13;
organizations; (b) creation of lamb and wool marketing infrastructure; (c) establishment of support&#13;
services for sheep and wool farmers; and (d) strengthening of sheep research and development.&#13;
Grassroots organization would be critical in enabling farmers to respond appropriately to the rapidly&#13;
changing market signals as the process of economic reforms and liberalization takes root.&#13;
Bank's Experience and Lessons&#13;
2.6    The Bank Group has no previous involvement in the agricultural sector in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
However, limited experience with the ongoing Economic Rehabilitation Credit indicates that inadequate&#13;
implementation capacity is a very serious issue. Recent evaluations of livestock projects financed by the&#13;
Bank show an improving success rate against a deteriorating success rate for agriculture in general.&#13;
Critical ingredients having a positive effect on project success include: (a) absence of internal price&#13;
controls; (b) clear definition of the role of the public and private sector, with, wherever possible,&#13;
increased involvement of the private sector; (c) increased attention towards livestock-environment&#13;
interactions; (d) acknowledgement of the positive role of national livestock research on livestock&#13;
productivity; and (e) focus on private family farm development instead of support to public and semi-&#13;
public livestock production and processing. These factors have been incorporated in the design of the&#13;
SDP in various ways. Nevertheless, weak implementation capacity in the public sector will be critical&#13;
to the success of the proposed project. The situation in the Kyrgyz Republic is made worse by the fact&#13;
that the development of private farming depends, at least initially, on Government support. However,&#13;
the Government itself needs help, in the form of technical assistance, to be able to assist the development&#13;
of private farming. The proposed project recognizes this unpleasant reality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.7    Given the limited local project implementation capacity and experience in the FSU and Eastem&#13;
European countries, effective project implementation requires reliance on extensive technical assistance.&#13;
Early Bank projects, such as the Economic Rehabilitation Project, which was essentially a Technical&#13;
Assistance operation, have succeeded in using TA in implementation, recruitment of consultants,&#13;
establishment of termis of reference, and other procedures which increase the sense of local ownership&#13;
of the project. These lessons have been incorporated in the proposed project through: (a) the provision&#13;
to set-up a Project Implementation Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, which will have a broad&#13;
mandate conceming project implementation issues; and (b) the implementation of several project&#13;
components shall be sub-contracted by the PIU to various public and private sector agencies, including&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
Project Design Options&#13;
2.8   Several project design options were initially considered.  These included: (a) leaving the&#13;
marketing system for lamb and wool in Govermment hands; (b) establishing a sophisticated wool testing&#13;
facility as part of the producer-managed marketing system; (c) a sheep industry that is managed and&#13;
controlled by producers with a credit component; and (d) a sheep industry that is managed and controlled&#13;
by private producers with some support services being initially provided by the Government, but which&#13;
would eventually be assumed by the industry. These options were individually evaluated and the last&#13;
option was finally selected as the most cost-effective and appropriate strategy for achieving the project&#13;
objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
III. TIE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives and Brief Description&#13;
3.1    Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed Project are to: (a) increase the profitability&#13;
and efficiency of sheep and wool farming; (b) privatize the provision of several services to farmers,&#13;
including wool marketing and veterinary services; and (c) improve the management and conservation of&#13;
natural grazing resources by farmers. To achieve these objectives, the project would focus on: (i)&#13;
organizing sheep and wool farmers into farmers' associations or groups through which essential services&#13;
can be channeled; (ii) developing a competitive marketing structure with incentives for production of&#13;
quality lambs and wool for premium prices; (iii) increasing sheep and wool productivity through&#13;
establishing training and advisory services for private farmers and supporting selected breeding activities;&#13;
and (iv) developing and disseminating sustainable pasture management techniques among sheep producers.&#13;
These objectives have been translated into monitorable performance indicators (Annex D). These are&#13;
market-based strategies that would require intensive transfer of "technical know how" and market-oriented&#13;
management skills to the Kyrgyz technical experts and sheep producers. In this sense, the project is&#13;
extremely technology transfer intensive.&#13;
3.2    Brief Project Description. The proposed project consists of three main components. These are:&#13;
(a) Sheep Private Enterprise Development (SPED); (b) Development of Livestock Support Services&#13;
(DLSS); and (c) Sheep Breeding Research Support (SBRS).&#13;
Detailed Project Features&#13;
3.3    Sheep Private Enterprise Development (SPED).  The specific objectives of SPED are: (a) to&#13;
establish several sheep producers' groups or associations (SPGAs) at village level which would eventually&#13;
affiliate themselves to regional sheep breeders associations (RSBAs) and a national Kyrgyz Sheep&#13;
Breeders Association (KSBA); and (b) to establish a new marketing system for lamb and greasy wool with&#13;
incentives for production of quality products. The development of SPGAs, new marketing system, and&#13;
agricultural training and advisory services are closely interlinked and critical to the development of a&#13;
market-based sheep industry in the country.&#13;
3.4   Sheep Producers' Groups/Associations (SPGAs). The transition from a command system&#13;
towards a market economy requires the transfer of responsibilities from the state to individual groups of&#13;
the society. The state can no longer provide secure employment in rural areas where state farms and&#13;
rural enterprises are collapsing one after another. The transfer of responsibility cannot be done by&#13;
decree, but by supporting interested groups to prepare them to shoulder this responsibility. After&#13;
independence several local NGOs emerged from former state organizations to pursue social and ecological&#13;
objectives, but most of them have not completely succeeded to free themselves from the legacy of state&#13;
influence. Two new national farmers' associations with economic objectives have been established, but&#13;
they have tended to confuse economic with political pursuits. Grassroots farmers' associations or groups&#13;
would play an important role by taking over part of the those tasks the state can no longer fulfill. Such&#13;
associations or groups, based on self-help and self-accountability principles, would constitute a departure&#13;
from the "top down" and centralized decision-making approaches of the command system. With regard&#13;
to sheep producers, the project would support the promotion of SPGAs to initially address four critical&#13;
issues in sheep production and marketing: (i) to arrest the drift toward unregulated sheep breeding among&#13;
small private producers through the introduction of certification and registration of rams (flock book&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
registration); (ii) to provide small private producers with technical and managerial know how (to be&#13;
provided in close cooperation with ATAS and other extension service programs); (iii) to facilitate the&#13;
marketing of sheep products, including lamb, wool, and skins, by small private producers; and (iv) to&#13;
manage common pastures on a sustainable basis.&#13;
3.5   The SPGAs would be village-based and, in accordance with Kyrgyz traditions, organized around&#13;
a clan or extended family. Their members would be independent farmers or groups of independent&#13;
farmers registered with the local State Statistics Office. The SPGAs, once established, would be&#13;
registered with the State Statistics Office as societies with limited liability. They would have "open&#13;
membership" with free entry and exit rights. SPGAs would be managed and operated by members on&#13;
cooperative principles. Project support to groups would be demand-driven, namely only producers who&#13;
are willing and able to participate in the designated group activities would benefit from the support&#13;
provided under this sub-component. The project would provide technical, organizational, managerial and&#13;
financial support to the groups or associations to enable them to overcome the constraints they are facing.&#13;
About 150-200 groups/associations, averaging 30-50 members (50-100 households) and raising 1.5-2.0&#13;
million sheep, are expected to be established during the life of the project. These groups or associations&#13;
would be the focus for improvements in regulating sheep breeding, animal husbandry, wool shearing,&#13;
sorting and marketing, and sustainable management of common pastures. These tasks would be&#13;
implemented by the SPGAs with technical support provided by staff ATAS, KSBA/RSBA, and the&#13;
Veterinary Department.&#13;
3.6   The privatization of sheep ownership has disrupted the breeding and selection program which was&#13;
exclusively based on the state and collective farm system and artificial insemination. Private sheep&#13;
owners are now relying more on natural mating methods (using rams). This has the risk of spreading&#13;
some diseases by unhealthy rams. In addition breeding by private farmers is increasingly becoming&#13;
unregulated both in respect of strain and breed, affecting the quality and yield of wool. SPGAs would&#13;
be instrumental in regulating sheep breeding at the farm level. This would be done through the&#13;
introduction of licensing and registration of rams held by individual farmers by each SPGA with the&#13;
assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. For this purpose, each SPGA would maintain a&#13;
pedigree or breed book in which each licensed ram of each member would be registered. All such rams&#13;
would be periodically checked and certified by the Department of Veterinary Services and those found&#13;
unfit would be eliminated or castrated. Similarly, the introduction of new genetic material (semen) under&#13;
the project would be done under the auspices of the SPGAs. The appropriate semen would be procured,&#13;
on the basis of members' requirements and ATAS advice, by the SPGA for distribution or sale to its&#13;
individual members. The decision whether to distribute free of charge or sell the semen would be made&#13;
by the SPGAs, depending on their financial situation. Some SPGAs may choose to provide Al services&#13;
to their members.&#13;
3.7   The SPGAs would also function as grazing associations responsible for managing the utilization&#13;
of common pastures. Sustainable management of common natural pastures would be complex and would&#13;
require the SPGAs to limit individual flock sizes and stocking rates, promote increased production and&#13;
use of fodder by individual farmers, foster change in individual flock structure (by reducing the number&#13;
of weathers during winter to save scarce winter pastures and emphasizing younger sheep production from&#13;
more abundant summer pastures by individual farmers). These practices would be enforced by the&#13;
SPGAs. This would only be practical if leaseholds or grazing rights for pastures are issued to the SPGAs&#13;
rather than to individual members or farmers. Granting grazing rights to the SPGAs or grazing&#13;
associations would be consistent with both Kyrgyz traditions and the practice under the state farm system.&#13;
It would also create a situation in which members of an SPGA or grazing association would jointly seek&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
security in the grazing resource (land) rather than in sheep numbers. During negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that the Borrower shall take all necessary measures to ensure that sheep producers 'associations shall be&#13;
granted, on a leasing basis, grazing rights without prejudice to other users of pastures, whether&#13;
individually or collectively organized.&#13;
3.8   Implementation of the producers' groups/associations sub-component would be contracted out by&#13;
the PIU to an international NGO or consulting firm with the requisite experience and capability. It was&#13;
agreed during negotiations that the Borrower shall cause the PIU Manager to manage the Project&#13;
execution activities in accordance with the PIU Management Agreement, satisfactory to the Association,&#13;
which shall include, inter gjjg, provisions in respect of staffing of the PIU with qualified individuals in&#13;
sufficient number, and the management responsibilities to be carried out in accordance with a project&#13;
operational manual; such manual to be attached to the PIU Management Agreement and to constitute an&#13;
integral part thereof. The NGO/consultant would develop a rolling program with annual work plans&#13;
phased in to cover all districts with significant sheep and wool production over the implementation period.&#13;
These plans would include: (i) implementation details and expenditures for activities during the current&#13;
year; (ii) implementation plan and budget for activities in the following year; and (iii) a training program&#13;
for members of the group.&#13;
3.9    Regional Sheep Breeders Associations (RSBA). These associations would be established by the&#13;
local independent producers' groups/associations to facilitate, initially, the marketing of lamb and wool.&#13;
SPGAs domicile in any RSBA's catchment area would not be obligated to affiliate. About four or five&#13;
RSBAs, each with average membership of 40-50 groups/associations be established during the project life.&#13;
The RSBA would be instrumental in the operation of the proposed regional wool stores where much of&#13;
the classifying, baling, and wool sampling for testing would take place. They would also assist in&#13;
organizing regional markets or auctions for lambs where exporters and domestic buyers would participate.&#13;
The project would initially support the formation of these associations through technical assistance to be&#13;
provided by selected NGO/consultant. The NGO/consultant would provide advice to the associations in&#13;
respect of organization, management, legal, registration and marketing. RSBAs would be supported by&#13;
the project on demand and commercial viability basis. Like the SPGAs, they would be registered as&#13;
societies with limited liability. The project would also equip the selected regional wool stores with the&#13;
requisite wool baling and sampling equipment.&#13;
3.10   The implementing NGO/consultant, together with the ATAS and RSBAs, would identify and&#13;
select the location of wool stores and lamb auctions in the major wool producing regions and, using local&#13;
engineering consultants, assess the cost of the physical improvements needed in each store or auction.&#13;
Most of the stores belong to either oblast administrations or the State Procurement Agency. Some oblast&#13;
administrations have expressed their willingness to donate such facilities to local producers associations.&#13;
Before rehabilitation of the stores begins, they would be turned over or leased to the newly established&#13;
RSBAs with responsibility for maintenance. The project would provide for the rehabilitation of public&#13;
wool stores through local competitive bidding. Rehabilitated public wool stores would be leased to&#13;
associations at rental fees that reflect full cost recovery of the cost of rehabilitation within five years.&#13;
Rehabilitation of private wool stores would not be provided under the project. The cost of rehabilitating&#13;
wool stores donated to associations by oblast administration would be fully met by the associations&#13;
themselves.&#13;
3.11   The project would also provide for employment of regional wool store managers, wool graders,&#13;
sorters and support staff on a grant basis in the first year of operation and full cost recovery basis in&#13;
subsequent years. Short-term consultants to train local staff and sheep producers in shearing, grading,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
and sorting through demonstrations at the local wool store and farm level would be provided on a grant&#13;
basis.&#13;
3.12   Kyrgyz Sheep Breeders Association (KSBA). This association would be founded by the local&#13;
SPGAs and RSBAs at a national level. SPGAs that are not affiliated to any RSBA would be permitted&#13;
to acquire direct membership in KSBA. All RSBAs are expected to be affiliated to the KSBA. KSBA,&#13;
like its affiliates, would have "open membership". It would be incorporated as a society with limited&#13;
liability. KSBA would, initially, have three principal tasks. First, it would gradually establish the&#13;
necessary and sufficient range of technical services which would be complementary to ATAS. Second,&#13;
it would, in conjunction with the NGO/consultant, promote the establishment of SPGAs and RSBAs as&#13;
the channels for the delivery of project goods and services. Third, it would gradually establish the&#13;
essential commercial capabilities for complementing the commercial activities of its members, especially&#13;
in marketing. While membership of KSBA would be open to all sections of the industry, the voting&#13;
structure would ensure that both ownership and control, through a majority at general meetings and in&#13;
committee composition, would be in the hands of sheep producers through their SPGAs and RSBAs.&#13;
3.13   The need for essential SPGA and RSBA services would, however, precede KSBA's formal&#13;
establishment. KSBA would be formally established a year or two after a sufficient number of SPGAs&#13;
and RSBAs have been formed to become its constituent members.  In the interim period, the&#13;
NGO/consultant, employed to organize the SPGAs and RSBAs, would also develop the required&#13;
corporate, constitutional and commercial structure for KSBA operations as an apex body. Inter alia, the&#13;
NGO/consultant would: (a) act as the management committee of the Association; (b) establish a Group&#13;
Development Division to promote the formation of the primary associations or groups which would&#13;
constitute the main body of the Association's membership; (c) institute and develop the required producer&#13;
services, including the establishment of a new wool and lamb marketing system; and (d) provide key&#13;
technical assistance staff, including a Group Supervisor and Financial Specialist, and a Group&#13;
Development Specialist. The NGO would be charged with specific responsibility to establish KSBA with&#13;
by-laws acceptable to IDA/IFAD. Following the incorporation of KSBA, the NGO/consultant would&#13;
hand over the management of its affairs to KSBA's elected committee. An appropriate contingent of local&#13;
staff would be recruited by the NGO/consultant and their salaries would be financed by the project for&#13;
the first three years. The cost of the NGO/consultant contracts would be funded by the project for three&#13;
years. Project funds, in the form of grants, would be given to KSBA for these purpose by Government.&#13;
The project would also finance KSBA's acquisition of computers, equipment, and vehicles. Project funds&#13;
for these purposes would be given on full cost recovery basis, with a two year grace period.&#13;
3.14 Wool and Lamb Marketing System. The project would assist the sheep industry to set up a new&#13;
marketing system for Iamb and wool, where possible using existing facilities. This new marketing system&#13;
would be built around the following principles: (a) grading at the farmn and local (village) wool collection&#13;
center is of crucial importance to ascertain homogeneity and quality of the wool; (b) local wool stores&#13;
and lamb auction facilities would be owned and operated by producer groups, operating as marketing&#13;
cooperatives; and (c) the new marketing system would incorporate incentives for: (i) improved lamb and&#13;
wool production and harvesting practices by producers; (ii) verification of wool quality by independent&#13;
testing; (iii) wool marketing in lot sizes accepted by international buyers; and (iv) promoting sellers'&#13;
confidence in lamb and wool quality control and adherence to contracts.&#13;
3.15   The privatization in the sheep industry has resulted in small individual flock sizes to the point that&#13;
individual producers do not produce quantities of lamb and wool necessary for efficient marketing. In&#13;
order to obtain acceptable lot sizes and improve the efficiency of production, storage, testing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
marketing, individual producers would have to cooperate. This project component would closely&#13;
collaborate with the component that would be developing producers' associations and ATAS. Where&#13;
possible, it should follow, and at least be in tune with the initial set-up of small producers' groups and&#13;
ATAS, as these would constitute the prime basis of the new wool and lamb marketing structure.&#13;
3.16   The primary focus for improvement of wool quality would be the farm, local and regional wool&#13;
stores. At the farm level, emphasis (through SPGA and ATAS) would be placed on proper flock&#13;
management procedures, including appropriate timing for lambing, prevention of excessive vegetable&#13;
matter contamination in wool, proper shearing techniques, preliminary skirting of the fleece during&#13;
shearing, removal of any colored fibers, and separate shearing of any colored sheep. Primary wool&#13;
grading, classing, and sorting would initially be done at the local wool store largely by ATAS staff. This&#13;
quality control would be reinforced and refined at the regional wool store by NGO/KSBA specialists who&#13;
would check the grading and sorting done at the local store. The regional wool stores would be&#13;
responsible for putting together lots of wool sizes (weights) that would be appropriate for offer on the&#13;
international market. These lots, with similar characteristics, would be baled in packs of appropriate size&#13;
in accordance with international market requirements. These lots would then be cored and grab samples&#13;
removed for testing at both local and international laboratories in accordance with the requirements of&#13;
either International Wool Technical Organization (IWTO) or ASTM (US Standards), depending on the&#13;
market. The regional wool stores would be equipped with the requisite equipment for wool baling and&#13;
sampling for testing.&#13;
3.17   Lamb marketing would follow the introduction and adoption of a dual purpose sheep breed that&#13;
would optimize the production of both lamb and wool. Like wool, lamb marketing would be organized&#13;
under the auspices of the SPGAs and RSBAs which would organize local markets or auctions at which&#13;
local traders and agents of exporters would participate. A quality incentive system would be introduced&#13;
through a grade-based pricing structure to permit producers of quality lambs to fetch premium prices for&#13;
their products and to discourage the production of inferior animals. The bulk of lamb production would&#13;
be destined for export markets in the Middle East and Turkey to fetch better prices than domestic prices&#13;
(para 1 .31).&#13;
3.18 Wool Marketing Center (WMC). Although the regional wool stores would be free to export&#13;
wool directly to foreign buyers, the bulk of raw wool selling in international markets would be&#13;
coordinated through a marketing center in Bishkek. The center, owned and operated by KSBA, would&#13;
consist of offices and a wool display facility to present wool in an attractive setting to buyers. The&#13;
display facility would be used mainly for display of samples drawn from regional wool stores and&#13;
presented to buyers. The marketing center would, among other things, collect and dispatch samples of&#13;
core and grab wool for testing abroad; facilitate wool sales, including holding auctions during June-&#13;
August; and establish wool selling regulations that generate confidence and meet standards of international&#13;
buyers.&#13;
3.19   WMC would also serve as an information center, adequately equipped to collect and disseminate&#13;
international market information to local wool producers and buyers, including wool prices, standards,&#13;
sale procedures and conditions. It is expected that WMC's throughput would be about 16,000 tons of&#13;
wool, enough to justify at least three auctions of each 5,000 tons of greasy wool. Each of this amount&#13;
would be large enough to attract international buyers from China, Russia, India, Eastern Europe and&#13;
maybe Western Europe. WMC would generate its revenue by charging storage and brokerage fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3.20   Since WMC would be operated as a KSBA activity, its establishment would, therefore, be&#13;
contracted out by the PIU to the same international consultants responsible for the establishment of the&#13;
KSBA. An international Wool Marketing Specialist would be directly responsible for the establishment&#13;
and operations of the WMC during the initial three years. Upon the formal establishment of KSBA, the&#13;
WMC would become formally owned by the former. The project would finance WMC's physical&#13;
infrastructure (stores, offices, auction floors), and equipment on full cost recovery basis, operating&#13;
expenditures on a grant basis in the first year of operation and on full cost recovery basis in subsequent&#13;
years. Technical assistance would be provided on a grant basis. Project funds for these purposes would&#13;
be transferred to KSBA or before it is established, to the NGO/Consultant managing its affairs by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
3.21   WMC would establish regulations governing the sale of greasy wool in the country. Such&#13;
regulations would underpin the transparency and integrity of the new wool marketing and trade system&#13;
and would cover: (i) inspection in local and regional wool stores by designated inspectors; (ii)&#13;
establishment of standard weights and grades for wool; (iii) wool display procedures; (iv) wool baling&#13;
and sampling procedures; (v) payment procedures and terms; (vi) terms and conditions of domestic and&#13;
international sales; and (vii) procedures for settlement of claims, disputes or arbitration.&#13;
3.22   Wool Testing.  This is an integral and important part of wool marketing because it facilitates&#13;
the use of product differentiation as an important instrument of pricing policy. Pricing wool on grade&#13;
basis would stimulate quality improvement among wool producers, provided the gradewise price&#13;
differentials are significant. Testing of Kyrgyz greasy wool, on the basis of internationally accepted&#13;
standards, is a sine non quo for its entry and acceptance on the international wool markets at reasonable&#13;
prices. International buyers' confidence in Kyrgyz wool would, initially, be greatly enhanced through&#13;
client-specific or general testing by an independent foreign wool testing laboratory. At the Tokmok&#13;
scouring plant there is a wool testing facility which was previously used to test all wool produced in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. About 25,000 samples of wool per year were processed here. The samples processed&#13;
were of original size, instead of core samples. Consequently the facility is relatively large with a variety&#13;
of physical facilities and equipment, most of which would not be required for a modern testing facility.&#13;
A modern, small-scale testing laboratory would be set up in one room of this facility with provision for&#13;
future expansion under the project. Government would, however, need to transfer the ownership and&#13;
operation of the facility to the Livestock Institute who would run it as both a commercial testing&#13;
laboratory and a research laboratory. Combining these aspects of wool testing into one facility would&#13;
be logical and economic. The project would support the refurbishing of this facility by replacing some&#13;
of the obsolete equipment with modern ones, constructing an environmentally controlled room for storing&#13;
wool samples prior to measuring fiber diameter, and installing an auxiliary water heating device to bring&#13;
water temperature at desired levels. The laboratory would charge a testing fee. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that the ownership and management of the wool testing facility would be formally&#13;
transferred to the Livestock Institute by December 31, 1996. It was agreed that, should the Borrower&#13;
decide to locate the proposed wool testing laboratory at a location and facility other than the Tolanok&#13;
Scouring Plant, the Borrower' would submit a feasibility study therefore for review and approval by the&#13;
Association and the Fund. The said study should fully specify the economic and financial implications&#13;
of the Borrower's decision. It was further agreed that, if the Borrower decides to relocate the laboratory,&#13;
(a) any additional costs of establishing and operating said laboratory would be fully met by the Borrower;&#13;
and (b) the Borrower and the Association would agree on an amendment to the Credit Development&#13;
Agreements to the effect that the depositing of funds for such additional costs would be a condition for&#13;
the Association 's disbursement against any expenditures for the laboratory. Export marketing orientation&#13;
of the wool industry in the country would certainly require effective marketing promotion, including wool&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
testing. In order to eliminate some of the existing trade barriers for the sheep industry, agreement was&#13;
obtained to eliminate the existing export taxes and licensing for wool, hides and skins before negotiations.&#13;
3.23   The project would also support wool testing by foreign laboratories that would be competitively&#13;
contracted to one or two wool testing laboratories with international reputation for independence and&#13;
reliability. As the number of testing laboratories is rather small and highly concentrated (dominated by&#13;
the SGS Group), such contracting would be done by limited international competitive bidding.&#13;
3.24   Duplicate samples each of about one kilogram of wool would be obtained from bales stored in&#13;
regional or central store by WMC and mailed to the local testing laboratory and contracted testing&#13;
laboratories by commercial couriers. Such couriers as well as testing would be competitively contracted&#13;
out by WMC. Foreign wool testing would stop once the local testing laboratory has been registered with&#13;
the IWTO. Since world market international prices are based primarily on fiber diameter, the basic&#13;
wool characteristics to be tested would be yield and diameter. Testing of other wool characteristics would&#13;
be done on demand basis by customers. WMC would charge an appropriate testing fee. The project&#13;
would provide for the financing of both the foreign testing and courier contracts, including any incidental&#13;
expenses (e.g., inspection and clearance of samples in the recipient country), all of which would be fully&#13;
recovered through appropriate charges on wool.&#13;
3.25   Development of Livestock Support Services (DLSS). The transformation of MAF's role from&#13;
production and marketing functions to a provider of essential support services to private fanners would&#13;
be addressed through a Bank-supported Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP) and an IFAD-&#13;
supported Agricultural Development Project. The need for the provision of support services to private&#13;
sheep producers would, however, precede MAF's functional transformation under the proposed projects.&#13;
The proposed DLSS component would, therefore, initiate this transformation with respect to support&#13;
services essential to private sheep producers. Following the implementation of these proposed projects&#13;
and the TACIS extension program, the provision of support services under SDP would be merged with&#13;
the activities of these initiatives. These projects would be designed to ensure this merger. In areas where&#13;
the existing TACIS extension program would have proved effective and sustainable, every effort would&#13;
be made to blend this project's activities with those being provided under the TACIS extension program.&#13;
The specific objective of this component is to strengthen MAF's capability to implement the proposed&#13;
project and to provide essential support services to sheep producers. DLSS would comprise (i) the&#13;
establishment of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which would be contracted by MAF to execute the&#13;
project; (ii) Agricultural Training Advisory Services (ATAS), at oblast and rayon level, to advise and&#13;
train private livestock producers; and (iii) the upgrading of Animal Health Services to monitor, diagnose&#13;
and control animal diseases, especially brucellosis, and to enforce animal health regulations and&#13;
quarantines. Agreement on the creation of ATAS was obtained before negotiations.&#13;
3.26   Project Implementation Unit, managed by international consultants, would be contracted by&#13;
MAF to manage the execution of the project. The PIU would have operational andfinancial autonomy,&#13;
including the authority to select and sub-contract specific project activities or components to local and&#13;
international consultants or agencies. Agreement to that effect was obtained before negotiations. It was&#13;
agreed that the PIU would operate on the basis of terms of reference which, together with those of other&#13;
consultants under the project, were agreed at negotiations. The PIU would: (a) recruit its own local&#13;
qualified staff and pay competitive salaries; (b) program and coordinate the implementation of the Project;&#13;
(c) open and operate accounts in local and foreign currencies; (d) select and supervise consultants to&#13;
implement project activities; (e) sub-contract to various agencies, local or foreign, the implementation&#13;
of some of the project's components, under contracts to be approved by IDA/IFAD; and (f) supervise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
compliance to the Project Operational Manual by all implementing agencies. The PIU would be fully&#13;
accountable to MAF for satisfactory execution of the entire project. The Head of the PIU would have&#13;
overall responsibility to oversee the implementation of the project. He would be assisted by: (i) a&#13;
Financial Manager, internationally recruited, who would handle budgeting, accounting, and&#13;
disbursements; and implement financial control of the entire project, and (ii) a locally recruited Finance&#13;
Manager Designate to work with the expatriate Finance Manager; (iii) two local counterpart staff would&#13;
be recruited to understudy and assist the Head of the PIU in project management and technical matters&#13;
respectively; and (iv) a Procurement Specialist, locally recruited, to assist the Head of PIU in managing&#13;
procurement and sub-contracting arrangements. All PIU experts would be recruited competitively by the&#13;
Borrower through an international firm of consultants and approved by IDA. Six local support staff&#13;
would also be competitively recruited by the consultants. The Project would fund, for the duration of&#13;
the Project, the PIU contract with an international management firm through which the two expatriate&#13;
consultants and the local consultants and staff would be recruited and employed. The project would&#13;
finance the PIU consultant's contract during the project period. The Government has met the requirement&#13;
for the tendering of the management contract, which was a condition of Board Presentation. The signing&#13;
of this contract would be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.27   Agricultural Training and Advisory Services specific to livestock producers would be&#13;
established in areas where sheep production is predominant. This would be done to complement the EU&#13;
TACIS extension program and as a precursor to a broad-based ATAS under the proposed Bank and IFAD&#13;
operations. The ultimate aim under these operations would be to establish ATAS covering both livestock&#13;
and cropping enterprises within the context of a farming system approach. The project would start&#13;
building ATAS in those areas where livestock production is predominant. The project would also aim&#13;
to complement other pilot regional extension programs being initiated by the EU TACIS group and some&#13;
NGOs (Winrock and Swiss Helvetas). In particular, it would seek to be fully integrated with these&#13;
programs in areas where they have proved successful and sustainable. Integration mechanisms with these&#13;
programs would be determined on the basis of prevailing local conditions during the planning and&#13;
preparation of individual project annual work plans at rayon or oblast level.&#13;
3.28   ATAS would be critical to growth and profitability recovery in the country's sheep industry. The&#13;
emerging private farmers do not understand market-based decision making processes and, due to their&#13;
historical roles on state or collective farms, have very limited understanding of the complexity and&#13;
interrelationships of the many management and production decisions required to succeed in a market&#13;
economy environment. The private farmers recognize this need, and almost unreservedly place a very&#13;
high priority on the need for technical assistance. During the preparation of this project, the common&#13;
refrain from farmers was "show us what and how to do it". This, in itself, explains why the proposed&#13;
project is "technical know how or technology transfer" intensive, in terms of the relatively high share&#13;
of technical assistance and training in the total project costs. Neither MAF nor the Oblast administrations&#13;
have the resources or knowledge and experience of appropriate extension programming to implement&#13;
ATAS. Technical assistance, consisting of foreign technical advisors and consultants, as well as training&#13;
of local staff and farmers would be critical to successful achievement of the overall project objectives.&#13;
ATAS would therefore provide support to livestock farmers in critical areas of sheep production, sheep&#13;
husbandry practices, sheep nutrition and health, wool shearing and preparation and quality control,&#13;
grazing and farm management. The focus of ATAS would be to deliver extension and training services&#13;
which, for the time being, are not being provided by other donor-supported extension. ATAS district&#13;
offices would be established in response to specific requests by active groups of sheep farmers. In this&#13;
context the district presence of ATAS would be demand-driven by the ultimate target group, that is, sheep&#13;
producers. The groups would be established under the auspices of the KSBA group development program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(para. 52). The establishment of ATAS offices would start in Naryn and Talas oblasts, adding one oblast&#13;
in each subsequent year. Each district office would have a training coordinator, supported by two&#13;
technical staff. An ATAS manager in DLMD would manage the planning and execution of program.&#13;
He would be assisted by an expatriate Extension Advisor, based in DLMD. To ensure that women&#13;
participate actively in the implementation of project activities, a position for a women's advisor, to be&#13;
occupied by a female, would be created at oblast level within ATAS. The advisor would ensure that the&#13;
project provides women with appropriate training in awareness of their role and benefits and technical&#13;
skills. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that this position would be established at the beginning&#13;
of implementing ATAS in each oblast.&#13;
3.29   ATAS Basic Principles. The programming and implementation of ATAS would be market&#13;
driven. This implies that: (a) program priorities, in terms of technical packages or messages, would be&#13;
determined by the farmers' continual responses to market signals; (b) farmers, through their village or&#13;
rayon associations, would determine their local ATAS needs and would communicate these to ATAS staff&#13;
at rayon level; (c) the rayon producers' associations would collectively determine their priorities and&#13;
communicate these to their oblast representatives (RSBA) and ATAS staff; and (d) the process would be&#13;
repeated at the oblast and national levels, during which both ATAS and breeding research staff would&#13;
be involved. To further emphasize the empowerment of private producers in ATAS program decision&#13;
making, representatives of RSBAs would participate in the selection of ATAS agents (staff) assigned to&#13;
their oblasts and in their annual performance evaluation, and in the approval of the project's annual work&#13;
plans and budgets at oblast level. This would permit the sheep breeders associations, ATAS, and&#13;
breeding researchers, to work in concert to optimize productivity, meet market demands, and maximize&#13;
profitability for the individual producers.&#13;
3.30  ATAS Program Methods. ATAS would use the SPGAs as the principle vehicle of reaching out&#13;
to farmers. Within each SPGA, one or two "progressive farmers" would be identified and recruited to&#13;
volunteer to become "contact farmers" or leaders to spearhead the adoption of new technical packages&#13;
or recommendations. These farmers would usually be highly respected, closely watched by other&#13;
farmers, and have great pride in their position and ability to "make things happen". Rayon ATAS agents&#13;
would identify these private sheep producers and use their farms as demonstration farms to educate other&#13;
farmers on the basis of the identified priority program needs in the area. These progressive farmers must&#13;
therefore be willing to use their farms and sheep flocks for field days and "result demonstration" or on-&#13;
farm research trials. Typical training programs on such demonstration farms would include, for example:&#13;
(a) management practices necessary for the production of a quality wool clip; (b) proper shearing shed,&#13;
equipment, and shearing techniques; (c) methods of skirting, classing and packaging wool at the shearing&#13;
shed; (d) appropriate management of fodder and range pastures; (e) proper lambing timetable; and (f)&#13;
appropriate stocking rates and flock structure during winter.&#13;
3.31   In addition to field demonstrations, other communication methods would be used to reach out&#13;
to the producers, including the publication of simple fact sheets, newsletters, radio/television programs.&#13;
The messages to be communicated would be locally determined by the needs of producers in response&#13;
to market requirements. In general, producers' information needs would include: (a) wool and lamb&#13;
market information (prices, auction timetable); (b) pasture management practices, with emphasis on&#13;
grazing systems that optimize pasture and animal productivity; (c) winter pasture and feed&#13;
supplementation practices; (d) sheep breeding-breeds, selection practices, rams; (e) shearing, wool&#13;
handling and market practices or regulations; (f) flock health management planning and disease control:&#13;
and (g) routine sheep management practices such as lambing, castrating, docking, internal and external&#13;
parasite control methods, weaning, finishing lambs for market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.32   ATAS Staffing.  The number of professional staff employed by the ATAS would be&#13;
approximately 80, including 20 subject matter specialists and 60 extension agents. Senior staff in DLMD&#13;
(4 persons) and ATAS regional staff (6 positions) would be responsible for providing technical and&#13;
professional guidance in key subject matters and training ATAS rayon staff (60 persons by year 5 of the&#13;
project). The staff training program would have to emphasize four basic principle underlaying the&#13;
planning and implementation of the ATAS program: (a) the primary role of ATAS is to empower&#13;
producers and enable them to respond appropriately to market changes; (b) understanding of the dynamics&#13;
and techniques of demonstration farms and on-farm research by ATAS staff; (c) good training in sheep&#13;
husbandry and farm management with special emphasis on identification of operational problems of which&#13;
farmers might not be aware; and (d) ATAS staff training must be a continuous process. The project&#13;
would support four basic levels of training: (a) training and extension for private farmers and member&#13;
groups of the KSBA (the prime target); (b) training of trainers at the oblast level and later, at the rayon&#13;
level, as the extension service develops; (c) training of head office personnel; and (d) training of&#13;
Agricultural Institute young lecturers through a series of study tours in other countries with well&#13;
developed extension services. This would aim to enhance the Institutes' capacity to provide specific&#13;
training programs for special groups of trainers.&#13;
3.33    The project includes provision for adequate operating costs, which were lacking in the past, and&#13;
allowances for field trips. With proficient management, and regular training, there are enough incentives&#13;
to deliver professional and up-to-date advice to the farmers. It is expected that in the future some farmer&#13;
associations, organized under KSBA or RSBAs, would take over the assistance to small farmers,&#13;
including extension services, and that the Government provision of such services would be slowly phased-&#13;
out. Such transfer would result in cost recovery for the services provided. It is envisaged that some&#13;
ATAS staff would be drawn from the existing pool of livestock experts currently laid-off at state and&#13;
collective farms or whose services shall become redundant after privatization. In addition, existing&#13;
private farmers with professional qualifications and appropriate experience could be candidates for district&#13;
advisory positions.&#13;
3.34   The Project would provide for technical assistance, training and study tours, equipment,&#13;
transportation and, where necessary, incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis. All funds would&#13;
be channeled to DLMD by PIU on the basis of agreed yearly work programs and budgets.&#13;
Implementation of ATAS would be done by the DLMD under the overall supervision of the PIU.&#13;
3.35   Animal Health Services. Animal health services that the Department of Veterinary Services&#13;
(DVS) would provide include meat inspection, monitoring, diagnosing and controlling diseases of national&#13;
or public health importance, and enforcing animal health regulations and quarantine. The project would&#13;
support three closely related major activities: (a) privatization of veterinary services; (b) brucellosis&#13;
control in selected oblasts; (c) strengthening of the Government (oblast and rayon) ability to monitor the&#13;
prevalence of animnal diseases and disease control; and (d) local production of some veterinary vaccines,&#13;
including vaccines against brucellosis.&#13;
3.36   Privatization of Veterinary Services, involving private veterinary practitioners in disease&#13;
monitoring and control activities, would be promoted under the project through contractual arrangements&#13;
with the Department of Veterinary Services. The project would support the government effort to&#13;
privatize clinical veterinary services through training and financing the participation of private&#13;
veterinarians in the brucellosis control program. Producers" groups would be encouraged to have&#13;
retainer contracts with private veterinarians who would provide clinical veterinary services and control&#13;
of diseases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.37   Brucellosis Control would initially be limited to Naryn and Issyk-Kul oblasts where quarantine&#13;
is easier to implement than in the others. Project funds would be used to contract private veterinary&#13;
practitioners to execute the vaccination program and to perform clinical services. Government would&#13;
contract with the private veterinarians to carry out the necessary disease control activities, including&#13;
vaccination and limited testing. About 150 private veterinarians would be required in each of the two&#13;
oblasts supported by the project.&#13;
3.38   The project would provide for the planning of the brucellosis program by local consultants (from&#13;
the Veterinary Research Institute) with the help of an international Animal Disease Control Specialist,&#13;
the procurement of vaccines and equipment, supporting activities such as training, monitoring,&#13;
dissemination of information on diseases. The vaccines would be provided free of charge to participating&#13;
veterinarians and eventually to farmers, except the equipment which would be provided at cost.&#13;
Vaccination procedures would be conducted in compliance with FAO guidelines.&#13;
3.39   Strengthening Government Capability. The project would support the strengthening of the DVS&#13;
diagnostic and quarantine capabilities through upgrading of the diagnostic laboratories (in the project&#13;
oblasts) and a network of regional epidemiology units with the assistance of an expatriate Epidemiologist.&#13;
Testing of new vaccines at the Veterinary Research Institute would also be supported. Finally, the project&#13;
would provide for graduate training (MS and PhD level) for a number of young animal health specialists&#13;
in relevant subjects, study tours, vehicles, and equipment (including computers).&#13;
3.40   Local Veterinary Vaccines Production. The project would support the purchase of equipment&#13;
and materials to produce veterinary vaccines, including vaccines against brucellosis, locally. A lumpsum&#13;
of US$0.5 million has been allocated for the purpose, but disbursement of thesefunds must be subject to&#13;
the Borrower carrying out a feasibility study satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
3.41   Sheep Breeding Research Support (SBRS). Sheep breeding research is conceived in the context&#13;
of holistic production systems, consisting of production of appropriate sheep breeds and the ecosystem&#13;
(land and pastures). The sheep production and land management systems of the last 40 years were not&#13;
sustainable. Due to overstocking and pasture degradation, sheep were housed in sheds during November-&#13;
March and fed roughage and concentrates at levels that were economically unviable. The Kyrgyz Fine&#13;
Wool sheep were selected for staple length of greasy wool, with little attention to the economically&#13;
important traits of reproductive efficiency, body size and lamb growth rate, and the most economically&#13;
important wool traits of fiber diameter and clean wool yield. In addition to overstocking and concurrent&#13;
needs for high cost feed supplements, ewes were lambed during January-February, which resulted in peak&#13;
nutrient demand during the high cost feeding period. Furthermore, to maximize wool production, all&#13;
lambs were retained to one year of age for shearing before sale for slaughter. This further aggravated&#13;
the excessive stocking rates and high supplemental feed costs. The proposed project would support: (a)&#13;
the development of a production system that would reduce feed and labor costs and thereby improve&#13;
production efficiency; (b) improvement in breeding and selection technology; and (c) improvements in&#13;
pasture and fodder management.&#13;
3.42   Reducing Production Costs. In order to reduce production costs, private sheep producers would&#13;
be encouraged to match the sheep production cycle with the natural resource base production cycle.&#13;
Lambing should be done in late April and May, during which the peak nutrient demands for the late&#13;
gestation and lactation of ewes would coincide with spring forage growth. This would minimize or&#13;
eliminate the need for high cost supplemental feeding. With appropriate stocking rate, availability of&#13;
winter pasture, supplemental forage crops and crop aftermath grazing in lowlands would increase,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
eliminating the need for housing the sheep in winter. The ewes should be shorn just prior to lambing,&#13;
and the lambs should be sold after weaning in the fall. A review of the projected sheep production&#13;
budget models (Tables 6. la-6. ld), shows that a combination of adopting the above production cycle and&#13;
the development of an improved dual purpose Kyrgyz Fine Wool breed of sheep (para. 3.42) could&#13;
substantially reduce unit production costs and enhance the profitability of the sheep industry in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic. These two major shifts in sheep production would be market driven. The improvement in&#13;
wool quality would meet changing world market demands for finer wools. The increased lamb&#13;
production would meet major demands for imported lamb into the Middle East countries during the fall&#13;
and winter months following the shift in the Muslim holy season in 1997.&#13;
3.43  Improving Sheep Breeding. The existing sheep in the state breeding farms are highly selected&#13;
Kyrgyz Fine Wools. They are relatively small, with mature ewes averaging about 50-55 kg and mature&#13;
rams at 90-100 kg. To optimize lamb and wool production, the project would support the development&#13;
of a dual purpose fine wool breed with improved reproductive efficiency, lamb growth rate, and wool&#13;
quality. For this purpose, semen would be imported from two lines of sheep, consisting of the American&#13;
Rambouillet and the Rafter 7 Improved Merino. This would result in increasing the average weight of&#13;
a 150-day lamb by 50 percent over the Kyrgyz Fine Wool breed and produce the same amount and&#13;
quality of wool. The rams selected for semen importation should be the best of these two breeds, and&#13;
should have genetic potential to have above average performance of the selected traits. 5,000 straws of&#13;
semen, containing at least 70 million live sperm per straw, from each of the two breeds would be&#13;
imported each year of the first four years of the project. New rams would be collected each year to&#13;
maximize the genetic variation of the breed sample. 2,500 straws from each of the two breeds would&#13;
be used to mate selected ewes at Lushikhin (Talas) and Orgochor (Issyk-kul) State Breeding Farms.&#13;
Approximately, 1,750 ewes should lamb to each breed at each of the two breeding farms. The first two&#13;
years would produce first generation offspring which would be mated AI in the third and fourth year to&#13;
produce second generation offspring. A comparable number of Kyrgyz Fine Wool ewes should be mated&#13;
to the best available Kyrgyz Fine Wool rams each for comparisons at each of the two breeding farms.&#13;
All ewe lambs would be retained for comparison of reproduction and wool performance traits. The top&#13;
30-50 percent of the ram lambs produced each year would be distributed to AI private breeders and sheep&#13;
producers at cost.&#13;
3.44   Sheep breeding activities under the project would be done at three breeding research farms,&#13;
operated by Asyl Mal, at Orgochor, Lushikhin, and Soukulok Al Center. The project would support&#13;
upgrading of the physical infrastructure at these farms, particularly at the Soukulok Al Center. At the&#13;
Center, the following upgrading would be supported: purchase of a liquid nitrogen generator, semen&#13;
straw packaging equipment, medium-size semen storage tanks, small semen tanks for transporting semen&#13;
in-country. The AI Center would be used as the control point for imported semen, and would be the site&#13;
for all AI training programs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that the&#13;
breeding stock at and the ownership of the Asyl Malfarms participating in the project's breeding program&#13;
would not be substantially changed without approval of IDA and IFAD.&#13;
3.45   As private breeding farms have not yet been established, the bulk of breeding activities would be&#13;
done on these Asyl-Mal farms. DLMD is, however, expected to assist newly emerging private breeding&#13;
farms in participating in the upgrading program through advice, distribution and dissemination of&#13;
improved genetic material. This would assure rapid commercialization and privatization of breeding&#13;
services through the emerging private breeding farms. With the decreasing number of publicly owned&#13;
sheep, the proposed breeding program would require close cooperation, especially in selection, with&#13;
private producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.46   The project would support the employment of expatriate consultants (in Genetics and&#13;
Reproduction), to work with the staff of the Asyl-Mal in upgrading the sheep breeding program of Asyl-&#13;
Mal and to train its livestock breeding staff.&#13;
3.47   Staff of DLMD, Asyl-Mal, Agricultural University and selected private breeding farms would&#13;
be trained locally and externally using project funds. The Breeding Specialist and Reproductive Specialist&#13;
would provide a series of short technical training courses at various sites in the country, primarily for&#13;
those directly involved in the breeding program and extension personnel as well as staff of the selected&#13;
private breeding farms. The project would also provide for short and long term courses in sheep&#13;
breeding for staff of the implementing agencies, including MS/PhD training in foreign countries.&#13;
3.48   Pasture and Fodder Research. The project would increase fodder quality and availability and&#13;
assure a more efficient and sustainable use of natural pastures. To achieve these objectives the project&#13;
would support: (i) improved pasture monitoring, evaluation and protection; (ii) pasture and forage&#13;
research; and (iii) improvement of fodder harvesting and conservation.&#13;
3.49   Pasture Monitoring, Evaluation and Protection.  Every year, the Geobotanic Expedition as&#13;
part of the State Scientific Center of Land Resources and Use (SSCLRU) surveys the pasture conditions&#13;
of a restricted number of rayons. The location of the pasture enforces the use of horses as means of&#13;
transport. It usually took about 20 years to cover the whole country, but nowadays with a decreased staff&#13;
number, it is going to take much longer. This approach gives reason to question the reliability of the&#13;
existing data on the overall decrease in pasture productivity. To develop a fast country-wide monitoring&#13;
and evaluation method, the project would support a one-time intensive pasture monitoring and evaluation&#13;
program which should lead to the identification of a limited number of pasture status parameters or&#13;
indicators. These pasture status parameters would then be used for rapid pasture monitoring and&#13;
evaluation in future years.  Pasture characteristics to be considered are vegetation cover, species&#13;
composition, dry matter production, dry matter percentage of palatable and unpalatable species, perennial&#13;
and annual grasses, legumes and other dicotyledons. Based on pasture status, the (SSCLRU), in&#13;
collaboration with the Oblast Committees of the State Committee of Nature Protection (SCNP), would&#13;
identify areas which should be totally protected against any exploitation. The actual protection, would&#13;
be agreed with and implemented by each concerned rayon administration.&#13;
3.50   Pasture and Forage Research. Animal research and monitoring capabilities within the Livestock&#13;
Institute are inadequate. The laboratories are poorly equipped to meet national research and monitoring&#13;
needs relating to pasture and forage. Since the thrust of this project is to reduce the role of concentrates,&#13;
information on the nutritional values of various pastures and fodder would be an important input in ATAS&#13;
messages to farmers. The project would therefore support upgrading the Livestock Institute's capacity&#13;
to analyze and monitor the nutritional value of pastures and fodder in various locations of the country.&#13;
This would include laboratory upgrades, additional equipment, and acquisition of foreign research&#13;
materials.&#13;
3.51   Improved Harvesting and Preservation of Winter Fodder. The project would support the&#13;
increase of winter feed availability by encouraging farmers, through ATAS, to adopt proper methods of&#13;
forage harvesting and storage. For example, following proper harvesting management for lucerne could&#13;
penmit a third, instead of two, harvests or leave significant amounts of forage for aftermath grazing.&#13;
Advice on establishment of fodder production (legumes) on marginal lands, currently unprofitably&#13;
cropped with wheat and barley, would enhance availability of winter grazing resources. Advice on&#13;
proper management of pastures would also arrest the deterioration of spring and fall pasture composition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
into poor quality grasses, thistles and other noxious weeds, some of which are detrimental to sheep&#13;
performance and wool quality.&#13;
3.52  SSCLRU and ATAS would be contracted by the PIU to implement these activities. The PIU&#13;
would also employ consultants to assist the two organizations in implementing their respective activities,&#13;
including a Pasture Management Specialist, a Fodder Haying/Storing Specialist on short term basis. The&#13;
implications on pasture and agricultural fodder management resulting from the above activities would be&#13;
disseminated through annual seminars involving ATAS staff and farmers groups. These seminars would&#13;
be organized by DLMD.&#13;
3.53   Policies and regulations governing the use and management of pastures are still evolving within&#13;
the context of the ongoing land reform process in the country. W ithout prejudice to this process,&#13;
assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Borrower would ensure that: (i) the grazing rights&#13;
leased by the Borrower to sheep producers' associations and other users shall be for land management&#13;
units large enough to support sustainable grazing systems in respect of the respective size of the sheep&#13;
management unit; and (ii) the lease contracts and administrative acts relating to the granting of grazing&#13;
rights shall include adequate provisions stipulating grazing regulations andpractices designed to establish&#13;
good pasture management practices, and shall be duly implemented.&#13;
&#13;

IV. PRoJECT Cosms AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
4.1   Project Costs. Total costs over the five year period of the project are estimated at US$16.8&#13;
mnillion (Table 4.1), including physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange part of these costs&#13;
is estimated at US$12.7 million, or 76 percent of total costs. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have&#13;
been calculated on the costs of equipment and civil works, and price contingencies of 2.6 percent per&#13;
year, reflecting the Bank's estimate of the average annual price increase for 1996-2003, have been&#13;
included. Detailed cost tables are in Annex A.&#13;
4.2   Table 4.2 snumarizes the project costs by categories. Investment costs (including technical&#13;
assistance) make up US$13.5 million, or 80 percent of total project costs. Technical assistance costs&#13;
would be USS4.1 rnillion, or 25 percent of total costs. This reflects the severity of lack of local&#13;
implementation capacity and the need for implementation support and institution-building. The latter is&#13;
also reflected by the relatively high cost of training (US$1.6 million, or 10 percent of total costs). The&#13;
transformation of the Kyrgyz sheep industry into a market-responsive system is initially extremely&#13;
technical "know-how" intensive, given the dearth of market-based management skills and technical&#13;
knowledge in the industry today.&#13;
4.3   Financing Plan. The proposed IDA Credit of US$11.6 million equivalent would finance 69&#13;
percent of total project costs, and 91 percent of foreign exchange costs. The International Fund for&#13;
Agricultural Development (IFAD) would provide US$3.5 million, or 21 percent of total project costs.&#13;
The Government would contribute US$1.7 million, or about 10 percent of total project costs. This&#13;
contribution would cover approximately 52 percent of the total incremental operating costs of the project.&#13;
As a condition of effectiveness, Government would produce evidence that all conditions precedent of IFAD&#13;
financing, except the effectiveness of the IDA financing, have been fulfilled.&#13;
4.4    On-lending Terms and Conditions. IDA Credit funds channeled to Government agencies,&#13;
contracted to implement specific project components or activities, would be channeled as grants through&#13;
the regular budget process. It was agreed, during negotiations, that funds to producers 'associations and&#13;
affiliates for technical assistance, training and operating expenditures would be on grant basis in the&#13;
initial year of operation, and on full cost recovery basis in subsequent years. It was further agreed that,&#13;
after the first year, loans to producers ' associations and their affiliates for goods and civil works would&#13;
bear an interest rate determined on the basis of the prevailing discount rate charged by the National Bank&#13;
of Kyrgyzstan to be denominated in Som, repayable over and up to five years including a grace period&#13;
of no more than two years and the foreign exchange risk to be borne by the Borrower.&#13;

4.5    Procurement Responsbilities. The PIU would be responsible for carrying out all procurement&#13;
and disbursements under the project.  The PIU  would include a procurement specialist, with&#13;
responsibilities that will include, inter A ia: (i) training PIU staff on Bank procurement and disbursement&#13;
procedures; (ii) developing monitoring procedures for procurement and disbursement; (iii) ensuring&#13;
proper notification of bidding opportunities; (iv) preparing specific bid documents based on the current&#13;
Bank Standard Bidding Documents for goods and works; (v) preparing letters of invitation and terms of&#13;
reference for consultants; (vi) assisting the PIU in the evaluation of bids and proposals and the preparation&#13;
of bid evaluation reports; and (vii) assisting the PIU in contract administration. In addition, IDA will&#13;
monitor procurement activities, contract administration and project record keeping during periodic&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
4.6    Procurement Procedures.  The General Procurement Notice for the project was issued&#13;
immediately following negotiations. Goods and works would be procured under the "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of January 1995, and consultants' services would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" of August 1981. A summary of procurement arrangements is given&#13;
in Table 4.3. A Procurement Workshop will be conducted in Bishkek tentatively in July 1996.&#13;
4.7   Procurement Arrangements. The items summarized in Table 4.3 would be procured as follows:&#13;
Because of their scattered nature in temporal and locational termns, Civil Works for the&#13;
construction/renovation of regional or central wool stores estimated to cost less than US$75,000 per&#13;
contract and up to a maximum aggregate amount of US$750,000 would be procured under lump sum,&#13;
fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from three qualified contractors in response to&#13;
written invitation. However, any work estimated to cost above US$100,000 and below US$500,000 will&#13;
be procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using Europe and Centra Asia (ECA) Region's&#13;
Standard Bidding Document for NCB (Small Works). Goods, including equipment, agricultural&#13;
machinery, wool baling machines, computers and other office equipment, collated in different packages,&#13;
and estimated to cost more than US$200,000 up to an aggregate of US$5.7 million, would be procured&#13;
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The number of ICB packages would not exceed seven.&#13;
For ICB contracts, local manufacturers, eligible for domestic preference in accordance with Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, would be granted a domestic preference in bid evaluation equivalent to 15&#13;
percent of the CIF price, or the amnount of customs duties and other import taxes, whichever is lower.&#13;
Contracts for the supply of goods and equipment, estimated to cost less than US$200,000 up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$700,000 would be procured through International Shopping (IS) on the basis of&#13;
quotations to be obtained from a minimum of three suppliers from at least two eligible countries.&#13;
Contracts for the procurement of items or groups of items costing less than US$30,000 for an aggregate&#13;
amount not exceeding US$200,000 would be awarded through national shopping (NS), on the basis of&#13;
three quotations obtained from three different eligible suppliers, depending on the availability of such&#13;
items in the Kyrgyz Republic. Consulting Services, amounting to seven packages for a total value of&#13;
US$2.3 million for various components detailed in the Procurement Plan, would be procured on the basis&#13;
of proposals submitted by short listed firms in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. A number&#13;
of contracts not exceeding US$50,000 per contract and $0.3 million in total will be entered into with&#13;
individual consultants selected from shortlisted candidates acceptable to the Bank to carry out specific&#13;
tasks such as studies, produce training materials, case studies, legal support, translation services and so&#13;
on. Local staff shall be recruited through competitive process. Training, estimated at US$0.9 million,&#13;
would consist of assistance from foreign and national institutions, visits or study tours abroad, local&#13;
courses provided by local and foreign trainers. The training programs and the criteria for selection of&#13;
trainers would be agreed with IDA. Incremental Operating Costs, consisting of incremental local staff&#13;
salaries and allowances, utilities, communication, vehicle and equipment operating and maintenance&#13;
expenditures, would be procured in accordance with the directives and instructions contained in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual, approved by IDA and IFAD.&#13;
4.8   Prior Review of Procurement Decisions by IDA. Prior review of bidding documents, bid&#13;
evaluation and contract awards by IDA would be confined to ICB contracts for goods and the first two&#13;
contracts for works. For technical assistance and training, contracts valued at US$100,000 and above&#13;
for firms, and US$50,000 and above for individuals will be subject to IDA's prior review. All terms of&#13;
reference would also be subject to IDA's prior review.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
4.9   The proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit, and IFAD Loan, would be disbursed over an eight-&#13;
year period, expected to start at the beginning of 1997. The Credit's estimated disbursement schedule,&#13;
based on average disbursement profile of similar projects, is presented in Annex G. Funds would be&#13;
disbursed as follows: either directly offshore to suppliers or consulting firms, on the basis of procurement&#13;
and/or contracts approved by IDA/IFAD or to cover operating expenditures and local procurement&#13;
through two Special Accounts, one for IDA funds and the other for IFAD. (These would be opened in&#13;
a bank, acceptable to IDA and IFAD terms and conditions.) The requirements for depository bank&#13;
holding special accounts would be: (i) execute foreign exchange and local currency transactions; (ii) open&#13;
letters of credit; (iii) handle a large number of transactions promptly; and (iv) issue prompt and detailed&#13;
monthly bank statements. The selection of a local commercial bank would be decided in consultation&#13;
with NBK and MAF in accordance with above requirements. The authorized amounts for the IDA&#13;
Special Account and the IFAD would be US$1.0 million and US$400,000 respectively. IDA and IFAD&#13;
would make initial deposits estimated at US$200,000 and US$100,000 respectively from their proposed&#13;
financing, immediately upon effectiveness, reflecting the estimated costs of operating costs, local training,&#13;
local procurement, and foreign expenditures for three months. Applications for the replenishment of&#13;
these special accounts would be monthly. Disbursement would be fully documented except that Statement&#13;
of Expenses (SOE) would be for: (i) all incremental operating costs and local training; (ii) contracts of&#13;
goods and civil works valued at less than US$200,000; (iii) contracts of consultant firms valued at less&#13;
than US$100,000; and (iv) contracts of individual consultants valued at less than US$50,000. The&#13;
documentation for justification of withdrawals made under SOE's will be retained by the PIU, will be&#13;
reviewed by IDA/lFAD missions, and will be audited annually.&#13;
4.10  Immediately after effectiveness, PIU would open and operate a Project Account in a Kyrgyz bank.&#13;
The Borrower would deposit into this account, an amount representing one-tenth of project financing&#13;
required semi-annually, and Government would agree and commit itself to pay in the saxpe amount every&#13;
six months. This first deposit by Government into the Project Account would be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness. The persons authorized to sign for this Project Account would be the Head of the PIU,&#13;
,ointlY with a senior official of MAF specifically designated to that effect by the Deputy Minister of&#13;
Agriculture and Food responsible for livestock. These funds would be used exclusively for the local&#13;
operating costs of all the project's components.&#13;
4.11   Disbursements would be made by IDA for the total costs of the following components (the figures&#13;
are from Table 4.2): (i) the PIU, US$1.1 million, Animal Health, US$2.7 million, Sheep Breeding&#13;
Research, US$4.1 million, Pastures, US$0.9 million, and the Wool Marketing components, US$3.7&#13;
million, making a total of US$12.4 million. IDA would provide US$11.6 million, and part of the&#13;
incremental operating costs of these components (US$0.8 million) would be drawn from the&#13;
Government's contribution to project costs of US$1.7 million, leaving a balance of US$0.9 million.&#13;
4.12   Disbursements under the IDA Credit of US$11.6 million, which would be fully disbursed within&#13;
8 years, would cover approximately 90 percent of the costs as follows:&#13;
(a)    100 percent of the costs of Consulting Services for the PIU (US$0.9 million), Animal&#13;
health (US$0.3 million), Sheep Breeding Research (US$0.2 million), Pastures and Land&#13;
Resources (US$0.2 million), and the Wool Quality Testing and Marketing (US$0.7&#13;
million, making a total of US$2.3 million);&#13;
(b)    100 percent of costs of training for the above five components, with a total of US$0.9&#13;
million;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
(c)    100 percent of foreign expenditure, or ex-factory costs of goods, for equipment for the&#13;
above five components, with a total of US$2.4 million, vehicles for a total of US$0.4&#13;
million, vaccines for the brucellosis campaign, US$1.6 million, genetic material (rams&#13;
or semen) for US$2.0 million, a total of US$6.4 million. In case of local procurement,&#13;
IDA's share of the costs would be reduced to 90 percent, with the Government providing&#13;
the balance;&#13;
(d)    90 percent of the cost of civil works mainly for the rehabilitation of the rural wool stores&#13;
(US$0.7 million), with the Government providing the difference; and&#13;
(e)    expenditures for operating costs (including vehicle and equipment maintenance and&#13;
operating costs, office supplies, utilities and salaries, wages and allowances) of the five&#13;
components indicated above: PIU (US$0.1 million), Animal Health (US$0.2 million),&#13;
Sheep Breeding Research (US$0.9 million), Pastures (US$0.2 million), and Wool&#13;
Marketing &amp; Testing (US$0.6 million), a total of US$2.0 million. It is estimated that&#13;
IDA would disburse US$1.3 million of the operating costs (the Government will provide&#13;
the balance of US$0.8 million from its contribution to project costs.) As a result, IDA&#13;
disbursements for operating costs of those components would be 80 percent in year 1 and&#13;
50 percent from year 2 onwards.&#13;
4.13   IFAD would disburse for the total costs of the ATAS, US$2.6 million (equipment US$0.5&#13;
million, Consulting services US$0.9 million, Training US$0.5 million, and operating costs US$0.7&#13;
million); KSBA, US$1.8 million (equipment US$0.1 million, Training US$0.2 million, Consulting&#13;
Services US$0.9 million and operating costs US$0.5 million) making a total of US$4.4 million. IFAD&#13;
would provide US$3.5 million and use the balance of Government's contribution of US$0.9 million.&#13;
Percentage of disbursement for all cost would be the same as for IDA, except that IFAD's share of&#13;
operating costs of US$0.3 million (costs US$1.2 million less government's participation of US$0.9&#13;
million) would be disbursed at the following rates: in year 1, 80 percent of all operating costs of IFAD's&#13;
components, 60 percent in year 2, and 10 percent from year 3 onwards.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.14   Accounting. The PIU would introduce and supervise the use of an accounting and control system&#13;
capable of reliably recording and reporting all financial transactions by the various implementation&#13;
agencies. This system must be operational when project expenditure begins. For the use of Statement&#13;
of Expenditures, the PIU would process and maintain SOE documentation to IDA's and IFAD's&#13;
satisfaction. For the Special Account mechanism, the PIU and the depository commercial bank would&#13;
agree on procedures for proper accounting of receipts, payments and submission of documentation to IDA&#13;
for the replenishment of the account.&#13;
4.15   Auditing. Annual accounts for the project, including Statement of Expenses (SOEs) and the&#13;
Special Account (SA), would be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an&#13;
independent auditor, acceptable to IDA. The various implementing agencies, under contract to the PIU,&#13;
would also provide annual financial statements for the component under their management, which would&#13;
be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by an independent auditor acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
4.16   The auditors would be appointed by the borrower (PIU) and the implementing agencies close to&#13;
the beginning of the fiscal year, so that the auditors may commence review sufficiently early in the&#13;
financial year to complete the audit on a timely basis. Terms of Reference for the auditors would follow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing Projects Financed by the World Bank. of March&#13;
1982. The financial statements and the auditor's opinion and reports should be submitted to the World&#13;
Bank no later than six months after completion of the fiscal year. The cost of retaining the auditors&#13;
would be financed from the proceeds of the IDA Credit and IFAD Loan and included as part of project&#13;
costs.&#13;
Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
4.17   Monitoring and Evaluation. Annexes C and D show the details of the implementation plan and&#13;
of monitoring targets for each component respectively. The annual work plans would include a section&#13;
detailing the targets and the results that are expected to be achieved at the end of each year. PIU would&#13;
establish, on the basis of this information, a monitoring and evaluation system, and follow-up regularly&#13;
the progress achieved under the annual plan. The following year's work plan must explain any&#13;
discrepancy between the goals assigned and the results obtained.&#13;
4.18   Annual Reports. The PIU shall establish annual reporting on the progress achieved during the&#13;
year on all aspects of the project, problems encountered and changes introduced. Substantial changes&#13;
would have previously obtained IDA's comments and/or approval. The financial aspects of the&#13;
implementation of the project, flow of funds and a summary balance sheet would be added to this&#13;
information; the PIU must complete this annual report with all other relevant information, and send it to&#13;
IDA and IFAD not later than March 31 of each year.&#13;
4.19   Mid-Term Review. An independent consultant together with an IDA/IFAD supervision mission&#13;
would carry out a Mid-Term Review of the project at the end of third year of implementation. The&#13;
review would focus on progress made, take stock of the experience gained in implementing individual&#13;
components of the project, and evaluate problems associated with beneficiary participation in planning&#13;
and implementing project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT, AND IMEmENTATION&#13;
Implementation Strategy&#13;
5.1   In view of the rapid changes in the structure of the sheep industry, the challenges sheep producers&#13;
will continue to face during the transition, and the dearth of implementation capacity and experience,&#13;
flexibility in implementing the proposed project would be crucial. For this purpose, the project's&#13;
implementation strategy would consist of the following approaches. First, in order to avoid overloading&#13;
the inexperienced implementation capacity, most of the project's activities would be implemented on an&#13;
oblast-based phasing. Under this approach, implementation in the first year would be concentrated in&#13;
Naryn and Talas oblasts, to be followed by one or two more oblasts each subsequent year until all oblasts&#13;
have been covered. Second, the project's annual work plans and budgets would be reviewed and&#13;
adjusted, on the basis of the previous year's implementation performance and experience, at a meeting&#13;
involving MAF, implementing agencies, the Bank and IFAD three months before the beginning of the&#13;
ensuing project year. It was agreed at negotiations that the Borrower would ensure that the review and&#13;
adjustment would take place every year during project implementation as stipulated. Third, the&#13;
implementation of the sheep breeders' association and wool and lamb marketing components would be&#13;
done by the same contractor to ensure appropriate sequencing between these closely related components.&#13;
Fourth, the project would focus on promoting the production of both lamb and wool to introduce more&#13;
flexibility in enterprise combination (product mix) at farm level than at present. Fifth, to ensure&#13;
beneficiary participation, the project's technical packages and priorities, to be generated by the training&#13;
and advisory services in conjunction with the sheep breeding research, would be determined by the&#13;
responses to market signals by the final beneficiaries (sheep producers) rather than by extension and&#13;
research officials.  Lastly, in order to increase participation in project implementation by final&#13;
beneficiaries, a Project Implementation Council with significant beneficiary representatives has been&#13;
established to approve project annual plan and budgets.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
5.2    Given the variety of activities to be implemented, the wide range of institutions and agencies&#13;
involved in the Project, the limited experience of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in the&#13;
implementation of externally funded projects, and the need to provide on-the-job training to Kyrgyz&#13;
experts, an independent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be contracted by MAF to execute the&#13;
project. The PIU would have sufficient autonomy to: (a) recruit highly qualified staff and pay&#13;
competitive salaries; (b) coordinate the implementation of the Project; (c) open and operate accounts in&#13;
local and foreign currencies; and (d) select and supervise consultants to implement project activities. The&#13;
PIU would sub-contract various agencies, local or foreign, in Kyrgyz andlor overseas, with the&#13;
implementation of some of the project's components, under contracts approved by IDA.&#13;
5.3   The two PIU expatriate staff would be assisted by four national counterparts, recruited in open&#13;
competition (para. 3.26). Government officials who would like to compete for these positions would have&#13;
to resign from Government service. All Kyrgyz staff would be recruited locally and paid locally&#13;
competitive salaries. Agreement on the establishment of the PIU and on the hiring of a management&#13;
consulting firm was obtained before negotianons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
5.4   The project implementation plan is fully described in Annex C and the staffing of the&#13;
implementing agencies is described in the detailed project description. The following project&#13;
implementation plan summarizes the contractual relationship between the PIU and the individual&#13;
implementing agencies of the various project components or activities. The PIU would review and&#13;
approve all annual workplans and budgets prepared by the sub-contractors. Such workplans and budgets&#13;
would constitute informal contracts between the PIU and the individual sub-contractors (implementing&#13;
agencies).&#13;
(a)    Sheep Private Sector Development would be sub-contracted by the PIU to an&#13;
international NGO/consultant to implement the SPGAs, KSBA, and wool marketing&#13;
activities. The contractor would employ its own international and local specialists;&#13;
(b)    Technical and Management Advisory Services would be sub-contracted by the PIU to&#13;
DLMD for implementation. DLMD would be assisted by an expatriate Director of&#13;
Extension, employed by the PIU, in managing ATAS. DLMD would implement ATAS&#13;
on the basis of annual work plans and budgets approved by PIU;&#13;
(c)    Animal Health Services would be sub-contracted by the PIU to the Directorate of&#13;
Veterinary Services(DVS), who would enlist the cooperation of the oblast administrations&#13;
in which brucellosis eradication would be initiated. The PIU would employ a Senior&#13;
Livestock Advisor to assist the Director of DVS in implementing the activities under this&#13;
sub-component;&#13;
(d)    Sheep Breeding Research would be sub-contracted by the PIU to Asyl-Mal and a few&#13;
selected private sheep breeding farms. The PIU would employ an Animal Breeder, a&#13;
Reproduction Specialist, and an Animal Nutritionist to assist Asyl-Mal and the&#13;
participating private farms. The procurement of genetic material (rams or semen) would&#13;
be done by the PIU through ICB and would be distributed to the participating breeding&#13;
farms; and&#13;
(e)    Pastures and Fodder Improvement would be sub-contracted by the PIU to the State&#13;
Scientific Center of Land Resources and Use (SSCLRU) and the Scientific Industrial&#13;
Enterprise (SIE). SSCLRU would implement the pasture monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activity and SIE would implement the research on controlled grazing and pasture&#13;
rehabilitation and research on improved fodder harvesting and conservation. Consultants&#13;
associated with these activities would be recruited by the PIU.&#13;
Beneficiary and NGO Participation&#13;
5.5    At the grassroots level, participation of beneficiaries, particularly those of members of SPGAs,&#13;
would be promoted by the NGOs employed to implement the SPED component. In addition, the project&#13;
would aim, to the extent possible, at transferring the management of wool marketing and control activities&#13;
to the SPGAs and RSBAs. Direct involvement of Government agencies in undertaking activities suited&#13;
for the private sector would be avoided. For this purpose, the bulk of brucellosis testing would be&#13;
carried out by private veterinarians who would be contracted through local competitive bidding.&#13;
Furthermore, beneficiaries will have representation in the Project Implementation council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
5.6    Acting through their associations, sheep producers would participate in the annual reviews and&#13;
adjustments of the annual work plans and budgets at rayon, oblast and national level. In this way, sheep&#13;
producers would participate in determining the priorities of the key project components, particularly those&#13;
relating to ATAS and sheep breeding research. These two critical components would therefore reflect&#13;
the producers' responses to market signals. In this sense, their design and implementation would be&#13;
market driven.&#13;
5.7   To ensure beneficiaries participate fully in the selection, location, design and implementation of&#13;
project activities, NGOs contracted to implement specific project activities would work through local&#13;
beneficiary groups, especially SPGAs after they have been established. Because these SPGAs are non-&#13;
existent, NGOs would be engaged to establish them, and evolve methods for their effective participation.&#13;
The NGOs would also provide support to SPGAs in organizing input supply, wool marketing, credit, and&#13;
develop training for members. NGOs are expected to hold meetings with interested beneficiary groups&#13;
to ascertain their needs and desire to establish SPGAs in their localities.&#13;
Annual Work Plans and Budgets&#13;
5.8    The project is designed as a rolling program with annual work plans and budgets phased in to&#13;
cover all activities over the implementation period. Achieving implementation efficiency, high quality&#13;
works, cost-effectiveness, and beneficiary participation are some of the project's major themes. The&#13;
Annual Work Plan would include: (a) implementation details and expenditures for project activities during&#13;
the year; (b) implementation plan and budget for project activities for the following years; (c) designs,&#13;
drawings, specifications and bidding documents for regional wool stores and the WMC physical&#13;
infrastructure; (d) SPGAs, RSBAs and farmers' training programs; and (e) Memoranda of Agreements&#13;
between implementing NGOs and SPGAs and RSBAs in the selection, location, and design of local and&#13;
regional stores.&#13;
5.9    The project annual work plan, procurement plan and civil works plan, besides the project legal&#13;
documents, would serve as the main framework for project implementation. Confirmation of preparation&#13;
of a work plan and budget for 1997 to include project activities to be implemented in the first year of the&#13;
project, satisfactory to IDA/IFAD, was a condition of Board Presentation and has been met by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
5.10   Project supervision would be closely linked to the project objectives and the annual&#13;
implementation plans. It would involve monitoring a number of key indicators (Annex D) and assessing&#13;
both quality and quantity aspects of project implementation and impact. Heads of implementing agencies&#13;
would supervise component or activity implementation and provide guidance. In addition, PIU would&#13;
oversee supervision of project activities to assess field implementation progress and problems,&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries and impact. IDA and IFAD would normally field at least three supervision&#13;
missions every year to focus primarily on key implementation issues, sort out problems, assess benefits&#13;
and draw lessons, and provide advice to implementing agencies. The first IDA/IFAD mission would&#13;
include a project launch workshop to provide orientation and training for key staff in implementing&#13;
agencies on the project cycle, procurement and disbursement procedures, accounting and auditing&#13;
requirements. Nevertheless, full responsibility for project supervision would rest with implementing&#13;
agencies and PIU. Proposed experts on supervision missions are presented in Annex E.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Implementation Completion Report&#13;
5.11   An implementation completion report would be prepared by the PIU on the basis of Bank's&#13;
guidelines no later than six months after the Closing Date of the credit. The report would highlight&#13;
problems and successes experienced during implementation, both physical and financial and assess the&#13;
impact of the project to determine whether the project objectives were achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.1    The Project would generate substantial economic and financial benefits.  Benefits include&#13;
increased wool and lamb production, increased wool and lamb prices. In addition, the Project would&#13;
contribute to sustainable management of the country's pasture resources and would reduce the incidence&#13;
of brucellosis among humans. More importantly, the Project would contribute to the emergence of a&#13;
more efficient sheep farming sector which will contribute to reduction in rural poverty in the long run.&#13;
This will be done through the provision of critical support services and financial support for the&#13;
establishment of farmers' grassroots organizations. The project's training and technical assistance would&#13;
have favorable capacity-building effects that would be critical to the management of the sector's transition&#13;
in the medium and long-term.&#13;
6.2    The provision of Livestock Support Services, through ATAS, would be critical in: (i) realizing&#13;
the genetic potential of the existing fine-wool merino sheep and the new improved dual purpose sheep&#13;
breeds (production effect); and (ii) improving the quality of wool and lamb (price effect). The production&#13;
effect would consist of increased lamb and wool production.  The price effect would consist of&#13;
incremental value of wool and lamb as a result of entry on the international markets, increase in quality&#13;
of wool and lamb, and product differentiation. Both effects are detailed in Tables 6.1 a-d and are&#13;
summarized in Table 6. 1. As indicated in Table 6.1 by the "with" and "without" scenarios, the project&#13;
is assumed to have no major impact on the overall size of the national flock. It would, however,&#13;
substantially alter the flock structure and composition and improve the flock's productivity and quality&#13;
in terms of both lamb offtake rate and wool production. The bulk of lamb production would be for&#13;
export (para. 3.17).&#13;
6.3    The provision of Animal Health Services would be associated with benefits accruing from the&#13;
control or eradication of brucellosis in both animals and humans. These include decrease in human illness&#13;
and decreased reproduction losses in sheep. The former benefits are difficult to estimate. Reduced&#13;
reproduction losses would result in improved lambing and a corresponding increase in lamb offtake as&#13;
detailed in tables 6.1 a-d. Since it is not possible to isolate the impact of animal health services from that&#13;
of livestock support services, the parameters underlying the production effects (Table 6.1) assume&#13;
effective control of brucellosis and other diseases.&#13;
6.4    Sheep breeding and research support would enhance the genetic potential of the existing fine-wool&#13;
merino sheep through the introduction of new genetic material for developing a breed capable of&#13;
optimizing wool and lamb production in the country. It is estimated that an increase of about a kilo of&#13;
greasy fleece per head would become a permanent feature of sheep production after ten years. In&#13;
addition, the average weight of lambs would increase by almost 50 percent. Pasture monitoring,&#13;
complemented by ATAS advisory services, would enable sheep producers and rangeland supervisors to&#13;
avoid localized overstocking and pasture degradation.  Improved pasture management and fodder&#13;
production would reduce the pressure on natural pastures. More importantly, it would enable sheep&#13;
producers to replace high cost concentrates with long-term low cost pastures and thereby substantially&#13;
improve the profitability of sheep farrning ( Table 6.1 a-d). However, the short-term costs of improved&#13;
management of natural pastures would be higher than the cost of concentrates, but these are expected to&#13;
substantially decline after the initial investment have been made. This decline has not been reflected in&#13;
the economic justification of the project because it is not possible to reflect such changes within the&#13;
framework of the gross margin models upon which the calculation of the project's rate of return is based.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
6.5    The development of sheep and wool private enterprises, consisting of the establishment of the&#13;
SPGAs, RSBAs, KSBA, and the WMC, would enable sheep and wool producers to respond appropriately&#13;
to international market signals. This would improve the efficiency of the domestic marketing system for&#13;
lamb and wool. Wool testing would enable KSBA to use product differentiation as a major pricing policy&#13;
instrument to obtain premium prices on the greasy wool international market. Certification of Kyrgyz&#13;
wool would enhance international buyers' confidence and minimize market risks and transaction costs,&#13;
leading to increased producer prices and exports.&#13;
Farmers' Financial Returns&#13;
6.6   The beneficiaries of the Project would be private participating farm enterprises. Eventually, the&#13;
project would benefit all sheep producers in one way or another. At full development, the Project would&#13;
benefit approximately 14,000 households grouped into about 3600 farm units, which would employ&#13;
approximately 37,367 persons who provide for a further 112,000 family members. These persons would&#13;
receive an estimated additional net income of US$25.0 million per year under the project. By co-&#13;
incidence this group is among the less well off and are located generally in remote regions and&#13;
mountainous areas that are not well suited to other activities. The project would therefore contribute&#13;
significantly to rural poverty alleviation.&#13;
6.7    Gross margins per livestock unit, as proxy indicators of farm enterprise profitability, have been&#13;
estimated for three types of farm models, based on sheep breed (Tables 6.1 a-d). These consist of the&#13;
three breeds currently found in the country: (i) Alai/Fat-tailed Sheep for meat production; (ii) Kyrgyz&#13;
Fine-Wool Sheep for fine wool production; and (iii) a new Kyrgyz Dual Purpose sheep to optimize lamb&#13;
and wool production.&#13;
6.8   The following major assumptions underlie the calculation of the annual gross margins: (a) 2000&#13;
head units per farm; (b) an exchange rate of Som 10.5 per US dollar; (c) value of skins is not included&#13;
in calculation; (d) Kyrgyz wool price = 70 percent of Australia wool price (clean) in 1995 for "with&#13;
project" case; 50 percent of world wool market prices for "without project" case; and (e) meat prices&#13;
are projected at 40 percent of current Middle East and European market prices and assumed held constant&#13;
over the project period.&#13;
6.9    Based on the above assumptions, the following annual gross margin per livestock unit were&#13;
estimated (Tables 6. la-6. Id):&#13;

6.10  It is evident from the "without project" case that sheep production under the current marketing&#13;
conditions in the country is only marginally profitable. With the project, sheep production in general&#13;
would be extremely profitable. The project would have impact on lamb and fine wool production by&#13;
promoting the adoption of an improved Kyrgyz Fine Wool breed and an improved dual purpose sheep&#13;
breed. These two breeds would eventually outperform the Alai breed. Essentially, all sheep enterprises&#13;
would benefit from the improved marketing and prices, improved lamb offtake and productivity associated&#13;
with the Project. Cash outlays for the adoption of the new technical packages at the farm enterprise level&#13;
would range between 53 and 74 soms per animal and might not require external financing or credit&#13;
(Tables 6.1 a-d). They constitute about 30 percent of total variable costs, a higher percentage of which&#13;
is accounted by non-cash inputs, such as family labor and natural pastures.&#13;

KSBA Financial Projections&#13;
6.11   KSBA, once established, would operate the wool marketing center, testing, and information&#13;
center. Each of these activities would be operated as a profit center, maintaining separate books of&#13;
accounts in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles and following the accrual system&#13;
of accounting. The major sources of revenue associated with these operations would be warehouse fees,&#13;
lot building fees, broker's fees, promotion charges, and wool testing markups. Warehousing fees would&#13;
be paid by wool sellers for holding wool in the central store for obtaining core and grab samples and for&#13;
storing the wool up to two weeks after selling or auctioning. Buyers would be charged a storage fee on&#13;
wool held in store beyond the standard two weeks after sale. A lot building fee would be levied on small&#13;
lots that require to be amalgamated to form a standard lot of one ton for sample testing and sale. Brokers&#13;
would be charged a fee of I percent of gross sale proceeds to be paid by producers. Producers would&#13;
also be charged a promotion fee of 1 percent on gross sale proceeds to cover promotion and wool&#13;
marketing center expenses. A 33 percent markup would be imposed by KSBA on wool testing (local and&#13;
foreign).&#13;
6.12   No revenue other than testing fees is expected in the first year .of operation. KSBA's financial&#13;
projections relating to marketing, testing, and information operations are presented in Tables 6.7 to 6.9.&#13;
The projections show that these operations would be highly profitable, except in the first year of&#13;
operation. The operations would also generate sufficient internal funds for expansion after the third year&#13;
of operation. KSBA, as a profit center by itself, would rely on membership fees and member annual&#13;
contributions, both of which would be set at reasonably low levels. It would make losses in the first three&#13;
years of operation and thereafter make modest profits. Such losses would, however, be compensated by&#13;
profits from the other commercial operations under KSBA beginning with the second year of operation.&#13;
KSBA's consolidated financial projections indicate a healthy financial situation for the organization.&#13;
Nevertheless, the importance of competent management to KSBA's future financial situation cannot be&#13;
over emphasized.&#13;
Economic Benefits and Costs&#13;
6.13   The project's private benefits and costs have been derived from the annual gross margin models&#13;
(Tables 6. la-d). Using a standard conversion factor of one (reflecting the current equilibrium exchange&#13;
rate of the som), the models' financial private costs and sales values were converted into border economic&#13;
values. Fixed project costs consist of public expenditures by the Government and producers' associations&#13;
for implementing the project. Direct economic benefits of the project, over a 20 year period, would&#13;
consist of the value of incremental wool and meat production and increase in lamb and wool prices,&#13;
resulting from the provision of support services, animal health services, sheep breeding research, and&#13;
establishment of a new marketing system for lamb and wool. The new marketing system would facilitate&#13;
entry onto the international markets for Kyrgyz lamb and wool and permit these products to fetch prices&#13;
obtaining in these markets..&#13;
6.14   Project costs are into two categories: public and private costs. The former consist of all&#13;
incremental expenditures related to project implementation by the Government or producers' associations.&#13;
Private costs are those project-related incremental expenditures made at the farm level, including costs&#13;
of production, marketing, and transportation. The opportunity cost of producers' participation in&#13;
associations would be negligible and difficult to quantify. Although some project expenditures, for&#13;
example, most of the costs for the establishment of SPGAs, RSBAs, KSBA and ATAS, have long-term&#13;
institution-building effects and, hence, have economy-wide externalities, they have been treated as direct&#13;
project costs. This, of course, leads to understating the project's rate of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
6.15   The "without" project scenario underlying the economic analysis postulates that the existing&#13;
Kyrgyz fine-wool breed, supplemented by the Alai breed, would continue to dominate the national flock.&#13;
However, both breeds would not reach their genetic potential in terms of productivity and production&#13;
quality because of relatively poor husbandry at the farm level. The sheep industry's access to world&#13;
markets would continue to be constrained by inadequate marketing infrastructure and poor quality of&#13;
products. Product prices would therefore increase very slowly and might never be at parity with world&#13;
market prices. Wool exports would continue to be the major source of foreign exchange earnings for the&#13;
industry. The "with" project scenario, on the other hand, would consist of the following changes: (a)&#13;
the improved Kyrgyz fine-wool breed, supplemented by the introduction of a dual purpose breed, would&#13;
dominate the national flock and largely replace the other existing breeds after eight years of project&#13;
implementation; (b) the structural change in the national flock would gradually lead to lamb exports being&#13;
the major source of foreign exchange earnings, leaving wool exports to play a secondary role in the&#13;
sheep industry; (c) the sheep industry's access to world market for lamb and wool would substantially&#13;
improve as a result of improved marketing infrastructure and product quality, leading to increased product&#13;
prices which might be at parity with world market prices; (d) animal productivity and quality would&#13;
considerably increase as a result of improved animal husbandry and nutrition at the farm level and in&#13;
response to incentives embedded in the new marketing system for both lamb and wool; and (e) despite&#13;
the increased lamb and wool production for export under the project, the Kyrgyz Republic would remain&#13;
a small producer and price taker in the context of the world markets for both products.&#13;
6.16  In view of the above scenarios, the key assumptions used to estimate the project's economic rate&#13;
of return include (a) adoption of the new sheep technology would be completed in 8 years of project&#13;
implementation; (b) lamb prices are conservatively projected at 55 percent of current Middle East and&#13;
European market prices and held constant in real terms; (c) fine wool prices are conservatively projected&#13;
at 50 percent of current world market prices and which are expected to rise to 70 percent over the next&#13;
five years; and (d) the establishment of 150 producers' associations over the life of the project.&#13;
6.17   Under these assumptions, the project's economic rate of return was estimated at 57 percent. This&#13;
high return reflects, to a large extent, the high opportunity cost of the existing market distortions which&#13;
have depressed both prices and quality production in the industry. At the same time, it underscores the&#13;
need for structural reforms and price incentives to stimulate the adoption of productivity-enhancing&#13;
technology in the industry through the project.&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
6.18   Women in the Kyrgyz Republic play a major role in agriculture, including sheep and wool&#13;
production. They appear eager to participate in new income-generating activities, but they lack resources&#13;
and technical knowledge. Most of the existing local NGOs' activities are largely directed toward welfare.&#13;
The proposed project would reverse this trend by actively involving women in project activities, including&#13;
extension service and credit.&#13;
6.19   Women's daily work routine depends largely on the structure of the household's flock. Since ex-&#13;
state/collective farm sheep flocks are distributed on per capita basis within a household or family, all&#13;
women own sheep, although they usually regard this as a joint household asset. They normally reserve&#13;
the poor quality wool for felt and rug making. Overall improvement in wool quality would therefore lead&#13;
to upgrading of the quality of these products. To ensure that women participate actively in the&#13;
implementation of project activities, a position for a women's advisor would be created at oblast level&#13;
within the ATAS. This advisor would ensure that the project provides women with appropriate training&#13;
in awareness of their role and benefits, organization and management and technical skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Impact on Poverty&#13;
6.20   The majority of private sheep producers are found in remote mountainous areas of Naryn, Talas,&#13;
and Issyk-Kul. They have virtually no alternative economic activities. They constitute the poorest of the&#13;
rural poor in the country. Until recently their incomes were further depressed by Government export&#13;
taxes on wool, hides and skins and by the virtual collapse of the traditional domestic marketing system&#13;
for wool. The recent removal of export taxes and improvements in the domestic wool marketing system&#13;
will have considerable impact on raising the incomes of these farmers. Sheep and wool productivity gains&#13;
under the project would also result in improving their incomes. At full project development, about&#13;
14,000 households, owning a total of 7.2 million sheep, would benefit from an incremental income under&#13;
the project of about 155 percent.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
6.21   Once completed, project activities would be sustained. Incremental staffing and associated&#13;
recurrent costs would gradually be transferred to the beneficiaries through the farmers' associations that&#13;
would be promoted and established under the project. The improved policy environment, especially for&#13;
production and marketing, and the productivity gains, would provide financial incentives for farmers'&#13;
organizations to consolidate and expand their newly acquired assets or activities. Sheep and pasture&#13;
research and disease control activities would be the only project activities that would continue to be&#13;
financed by the government budget after project completion. These would be kept within manageable&#13;
limits and could be partially financed by the sheep industry through a levy.&#13;
Fiscal Impact and Cost Recovery&#13;
6.22   The impact of incremental recurrent expenditures on the government budget for agriculture would&#13;
be small. The total incremental recurrent expenditures per year would average US$622,000 per year over&#13;
the implementation period, with ATAS, sheep breeding research, KSBA, and wool testing component&#13;
accounting for the largest share. It is estimated that the Government would disburse US$1.7 million of&#13;
the operating costs. IDA and IFAD will provide the balance of US$ 1.6 million out of total US$3.3&#13;
million. About 55 percent of the total incremental recurrent expenditures would be transferred to the&#13;
sheep producers associations by the fifth year of project implementation. Recurrent expenditures for&#13;
sheep and pasture research, disease control activities and overall project management would be the only&#13;
ones that would continue to be financed by the government budget after project completion. Most of the&#13;
KSBA's commercial activities (e.g. marketing and wool testing) would become self-financing in the third&#13;
year of implementation.&#13;
6.23   The project would also institute full cost recovery for Credit funds on-lent for training, technical&#13;
assistance, operating expenses, goods and civil works to sheep producers' associations through charging&#13;
an interest rate that fully reflects the market cost of such funds. It is envisaged that the producers'&#13;
associations would become financially independent by generating adequate operating revenues from&#13;
membership dues, wool storage, and marketing fees which would be set at levels to allow full cost&#13;
recovery. The gradual transfer of extension services and wool and lamb marketing activities to&#13;
producers' associations are envisaged as an effective strategy for cost recovery under the project.&#13;
Impact on Private Sector Development&#13;
6.24   The major thrust of the proposed project is to transform the sheep industry from a centrally&#13;
planned and government-controlled industry into an export-oriented and efficient production system&#13;
largely managed and controlled by producers. This empowerment of private producers would take place&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
through the formation of village-based producers' associations and establishment of private enterprises.&#13;
This would entrust the critical elements of project implementation in the hands of profit seeking&#13;
enterprises. The associations would play an important role by taking over most of those tasks the state&#13;
can no longer effectively perform. The proposed project would support the establishment of sheep&#13;
producers' associations to initially address four critical issues in sheep production and marketing,&#13;
including the development of an efficient export-marketing infrastructure for lamb and wool; provision&#13;
of advisory services (know how) to individual private sheep producers; management of common pastures&#13;
on a sustainable basis; and control of unregulated sheep breeding and adoption of improved technologies&#13;
among small private producers. These tasks would be implemented by the associations with technical&#13;
support provided by government agencies and technical assistance. Within the framework of these&#13;
grassroots associations, producers would continually respond appropriately to market signals in terms of&#13;
product mix and quality. The project would also support the privatization of certain services which&#13;
traditionally have been the domain of the state, including veterinary services by encouraging private&#13;
practice by veterinarians, and sheep breeding by encouraging private sheep breeders to participate in the&#13;
sheep breeding program under the project.&#13;
Sensitivity and Risk Analysis&#13;
6.25   A risk for the project is that the international and domestic prices of lamb and wool do not turn&#13;
out to be as high as projected.  In the event of this happening, the incentives for adoption of new&#13;
technology, increased productivity and improved lamb offtake would not materialize. If the assumed&#13;
prices for Kyrgyz wool declined by 15 percent (i.e., were only 55 percent of the assumed world market&#13;
prices), the project's rate of return would be reduced to 49 percent. If, on the other hand, prices for&#13;
lamb declined by 10 percent, the project's rate of return would fall to 36 percent. A 15 percent overall&#13;
reduction in project benefits would reduce the rate of return to 34 percent. A slower rate of adoption of&#13;
new technology and full conversion after nine years would reduce the rate of return to 36 percent. The&#13;
project's viability is therefore extremely sensitive to product prices (especially lamb prices) and adoption&#13;
rate and, hence, to the quality of lamb and wool which would determine the level of prices to be obtained&#13;
in the international markets. A 10 percent cost overrun would reduce the rate to 44 percent, implying&#13;
the project might be sensitive to increase in the incremental operating costs at the farm level.&#13;
6.26   The success of the project is also dependent on the ability to export meat to foreign markets.&#13;
There is a large and accessible Middle Eastern market and the expectation is that live animals will be&#13;
transported by air or truck and that major investments in transport will not be necessary. The project&#13;
conservatively assumes that domestic lamb prices will remain only 55 percent of Middle Eastern and&#13;
European prices; this margin should be sufficient to allow for the export of Kyrgyz meat.&#13;
6.27   Due to the transition, the project has high risks. The project could be adversely affected by an&#13;
array of factors, including: (i) macroeconomic instability; (ii) delays in implementation of reforms&#13;
pertaining to land, market liberalization, and enterprise privatization; (iii) institutional uncertainty and&#13;
weakness surrounding the establishment of new farmers' organizations and a new farmer's advisory&#13;
service; and (iv) delays in implementation of the Project. The prospects for macroeconomic stability&#13;
appear good, given Government's commitment to both the stabilization and structural reform programs&#13;
(paras. 1.6-1.11). Implementation of land reform and market liberalization and enterprise privatization&#13;
would be key to the success of the project. Government's commitment to reforms in agriculture is&#13;
strong, but remains to be translated into actions. The price and land reforms are now well advanced and&#13;
would be difficult to reverse at this point. The project's risks associated with delays in establishing the&#13;
new farmers' organization and advisory service would be minimized by requiring up front appointments&#13;
of the PIU consultants and agreements on their establishment, staffing, and funding of ATAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
6.28   Another factor is the local capacity to cope with the demands of a range of new functions in the&#13;
marketing, distribution, testing, and research of wool. Many of these functions are foreign to the existing&#13;
personnel. A strong technical component has been incorporated in the project design to overcome this&#13;
weakness. Regular supervision would also be required for several years. While there is a clear&#13;
leadership role for Government to initially promote the formation of these new organizations, it is&#13;
envisaged that they would ultimately be controlled by farmers. Specific risks exist in terms of sharp&#13;
deterioration in greasy wool production and quality, themselves a consequence of the deficiencies the&#13;
project seeks to correct. In the short term, however, these risks might result in unused capacity of the&#13;
new facilities. But contingency plans can be devised to cope with this situation. For instance, the wool&#13;
storage, handling, and selling complex could be used for skins and hides when it is not fully used by&#13;
wool. The wool testing facility could be used for research when not fully utilized for commercial testing.&#13;
The envisaged annual reviews and adjustments in project workplans and budgets to take into consideration&#13;
previous year's implementation experience would minimize risks associated with project implementation&#13;
and permit continual flexibility in implementation. Intensive supervision would also be required in the&#13;
initial years.&#13;
Enviromnental Aspects&#13;
6.29   The Project is expected to increase enviromnental protection through research and extension&#13;
activities focusing on improved management of the country's natural pastures. The establishment of a&#13;
pasture inventory and monitoring system would guide farmers' and rangeland supervisors' decisions&#13;
regarding the use of pastures in the short to medium-term. This, complemented by ATAS advisory&#13;
services, would result in avoiding localized overstocking and pasture degradation. The proposed&#13;
improvement in pasture management and fodder production would reduce the pressure on natural&#13;
resources. It would be required, under the project, that grazing rights be granted for land management&#13;
units large enough to support sustainable grazing systems (para. 3.52). The producers' associations, to&#13;
whom most of the grazing rights would be granted, would be required to adhere and enforce regulations&#13;
and practices for improved pasture management among their members (para. 3.52). Finally, the project's&#13;
emphasis on the production of quality animals (rather than quantity) in response to market requirements,&#13;
would provide adequate incentives for improved management of pastures and fodder by sheep producers.&#13;
The project would discourage the present practice of using chemical for sheep dipping and, instead, rely&#13;
on spot-spraying on animals.  The Project has a "B" environmental assessment category.  An&#13;
environmental mitigation statement is contained in Annex B.&#13;

SHEEP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
ENV1RONMENTAL MITGATION STATEMENT&#13;
1.    The Kyrgyz Republic, with the assistance of the Bank, is in the process of finalizing the&#13;
preparation of a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) that outlines high priority environmental&#13;
issues in various sectors of the economy. In agriculture and the rural sector in general, the draft NEAP&#13;
highlights the following issues as high priority:&#13;
(a)    Water management and water supply issues that have emerged with the failure to&#13;
maintain water infrastructure in urban and rural areas have important health and&#13;
agricultural production implications. Immediate investment in rehabilitation and essential&#13;
maintenance of water infrastructure, and reforms in water pricing policy (including water&#13;
charges for irrigation water) have been identified as priority strategies for mitigating the&#13;
problems of water supply contamination and falling agricultural productivity and incomes;&#13;
and&#13;
(b)    Poverty and some traditional practices in rural areas (e.g., grazing resource and forestry&#13;
management) have contributed to serious degradation of soils and grazing resources and&#13;
are reducing the income potential of local farmers. The draft NEAP recommends general&#13;
strategies for better management and reducing the pressure on these fragile natural&#13;
resources. The proposed project's interventions would help to implement, in targeted&#13;
fashion, some of these strategies.&#13;
2.    Land Use. The project will provide for a system for continual inventory and monitoring of&#13;
natural grazing resources. The analyses and output of this system would be used to protect&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas, giving particular priority to reducing overgrazing in natural pasture areas&#13;
where this is already a problem. The monitoring system would also provide data and information that&#13;
would be used by Agricultural Training and Advisory Services (ATAS) staff to guide farmers' decisions&#13;
regarding the use of local pastures in the short-run. The project would also support research and&#13;
development of pasture production improvement with emphasis on the spring-autumn production in two&#13;
agro-ecological regions in which pasture availability is a constraint to sheep production. Resulting&#13;
improved yields would reduce the existing pressure on natural pastures.&#13;
3.    Animal Husbandry Practices. Through the establishment of an agricultural advisory service&#13;
(ATAS) and sheep breeding research, the project would promote the following environment-friendly&#13;
practices among sheep and wool producers:&#13;
(a)    Sheep Husbandry. Private and cooperative sheep farmers would be provided with&#13;
advisory services covering all aspects of breeding plans, stocking and culling rates.&#13;
ATAS staff would focus their advice to farmers on strategic feeding of conserved fodder,&#13;
management practices to improve animal nutrition and reduce prevalence of diseases,&#13;
optimal stocking rates for sustainable grazing, and improved pasture establishment&#13;
techniques and management. Improved management of shedding during winter and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                               ANNEX B&#13;
heavy grazing intensity near the sheds in few weeks prior to and after winter shedding&#13;
would be improved to reduce pasture and soil degradation;&#13;
(b)    Veterinary Practices and Sheep Disease Control.   ATAS staff would focus on&#13;
enhancing farmers' skills to identify and control diseases and the integration of animal&#13;
disease control with husbandry and nutritional aspects. The use of chemicals for sheep&#13;
dipping would be discouraged. Instead, farmers would be encouraged to use spot&#13;
spraying methods on animals;&#13;
(c)    Animal Disease Control. The project would also provide for a nation-wide eradication&#13;
of Brucellosis in sheep and, consequently, in humans. An international quarantine&#13;
protocol with neighboring countries to prevent the spread of the disease in the region is&#13;
envisaged.  In controlling animal diseases, the Livestock Institute would develop&#13;
reconmmendations for ATAS staff for safe use by farmers;&#13;
(d)    Fertilizer Use. No extensive use of fertilizers is envisaged under the project, except in&#13;
the production of fodder. Since alfalfa would be the major fodder produced, its demand&#13;
for chemical fertilizers would be minimal, reducing the incidence of water pollution.&#13;
ATAS staff would encourage farmers to use organic fertilizers which are becoming&#13;
popular with the increase of prices for inorganic fertilizers;&#13;
(e)   Irrigation. No new irrigation schemes are planned under the project. Fodder production&#13;
under the project would be done in the existing schemes. ATAS staff would focus on&#13;
enhancing farmers' skills to use irrigation water more efficiently than hitherto; and&#13;
(f)    Wool and Meat Processing. The project would have indirect effects on the existing&#13;
practice of wool scouring and operation of slaughter houses. Since much of the scouring&#13;
would be done by the private sector, it is important that Government set specific&#13;
environmental standards which must be met by all scouring plants, particularly with&#13;
regard to affluent water treatmnent. Much of the project's lamb output would be marketed&#13;
live and internationally and would have no environmental impact.&#13;
4.    Conclusion. The project would have a mitigating impact on some of the major environmental&#13;
issues that have been identified in the draft NEAP as high priority. The project has a "B" environmental&#13;
assessment category.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
ILPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
1.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) would contract the execution of the project to a&#13;
Project Implementation Unit (PIU).&#13;
2.    Establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). With funding provided under the&#13;
Japanese Grant, prior to credit effectiveness, a procurement consultant would be dispatched to Bishkek&#13;
to assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) in the selection of the management firm that would&#13;
staff and supervise the PIU (terms of reference for the firm and each one of the three expatriate&#13;
consultants are attached as Annex F), as well as the initiation for the recruitment of the Extension&#13;
Director who would be in charge of establishing the Agricultural Training and Advisory Services&#13;
(ATAS). The PIU shall be financed by IDA.&#13;
3.    Agricultural Training and Advisory Services (ATAS). This component is to be implemented by&#13;
the Department of Livestock Management and Development (DLMD), under a contract awarded by the&#13;
PIU. ATAS would be set up by the head and staff of DLMD, reinforced by an expatriate Extension&#13;
Director (see 1 above); PIU would award a contract to this DLMD, and would supervise the development&#13;
of ATAS, on the basis of approved yearly budgets. ATAS shall be financed by IFAD.&#13;
4.    Animal Health. This component is to be implemented by the Directorate of Veterinary Services&#13;
(DVS) of MAF, under a contract awarded by the PIU, which would supervise the implementation of this&#13;
component. DVS would enlist the assistance of the Oblasts in which the eradication of Brucellosis is to&#13;
be started. PIU would issue a contract for the Brucellosis Expert, under the terms of reference appearing&#13;
in Annex F, who will act as Senior Adviser to the Director of DVS.&#13;
5.    Sheep Breeding Research. This component is to be implemented by the Livestock Research&#13;
Institute (LRI). The PIU would negotiate a contract with LRI for the delivery of sheep breeding services,&#13;
and the PIU would award the contracts* for the Animal Breeder, Reproduction Specialist and Animal&#13;
Nutrition expert. New breeding material (semen) would be procured through ICB, under the supervision&#13;
of PIU.&#13;
6.    Pastures and Fodder Resources. This component shall be carried out jointly by the State&#13;
Scientific Center of Land Resources and Use (for monitoring, evaluation, and grazing areas protection)&#13;
and the Scientific Industrial Enterprise (the ex-Pastures and Fodder Research Institute, for pasture&#13;
research support). During the first year, the activities will be supported by a pasture management&#13;

            Kyrgyz Republic - Sheep Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Sheep Development
            Project are to: 1) increase the profitability and efficiency
            of sheep and wool farming; 2) privatize the provision of
            several services to farmers, including wool marketing and
            veterinary services; and 3) improve the management and
            conservation of natural grazing resources by farmers. To
            achieve these objectives, the project will focus on: 1)
            organizing sheep and wool farmers into farmers'
            associations or groups through which essential services can
            be channeled; 2) developing a competitive marketing
            structure with incentives for production of quality lambs
            and wool for premium prices; 3) increasing sheep and wool
            productivity through establishing training and advisory
            services for private farmers and supporting selected
            breeding activities; and 4) developing and disseminating
            sustainable pasture management techniques among sheep
            producers. The project consists of three main components: 1)
            sheep private enterprise development, including: (a) sheep
            producers' groups/associations; (b) regional sheep
            breeders associations; (c) Kyrgyz sheep breeders
            associations; (d) wool and lamb marketing; and (e) wool
            testing; 2) development of livestock support services, which
            comprises: (a) project implementation unit; (b) agricultural
            training and advisory services; and (c) animal health
            services; and 3) sheep breeding research support involving
            sheep breeding research and pastures land resources.
