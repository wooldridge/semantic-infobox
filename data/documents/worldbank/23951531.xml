2.    Pursuant to the recent discussions between the Bank and the Donor, the Bank&#13;
proposes to amend paragraph 8.1 of Annex 2 of the Administration Arrangement to read&#13;
as follows:&#13;
"8.1 It is expected that the Contributions will be fully disbursed by the Bank in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of this Arrangement by July 31, 2015. The Bank&#13;
will only disburse Contributions for the purposes of this Arrangement after such&#13;
date with the written approval of the Donors."&#13;
3.    All other terms of the Administration Arrangement will remain the same.&#13;
4.    The Bank will disclose this Amendment and related information on this Trust&#13;
Fund in accordance with the World Bank Policy on Access to Information. By entering&#13;
