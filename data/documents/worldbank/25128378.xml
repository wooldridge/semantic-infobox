&amp;#12;Future of Food&#13;
Shaping A Climate-Smart Global Food System&#13;
&#13;
October 2015&#13;
&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
The agriculture sector is a mainstay of national economies across the developing world. Agri-&#13;
culture is a major provider of food, nutrition, jobs, and export earnings, and the sector is key&#13;
to improving stewardship of the environment.&#13;
&#13;
Farming affects every member of the human family, and is the basis of food security at&#13;
national, regional, and global levels. A well-performing agriculture sector is vital for achieving&#13;
the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s vision of a sustainable global food system that can feed every person,&#13;
every day, everywhere with a nutritious and affordable diet.&#13;
&#13;
Climate change and agriculture are inextricably linked. Droughts, floods, and rising tempera-&#13;
tures are cutting crop yields, threatening food, fish and meat supply, and pushing poor people&#13;
deeper into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture and land-use changes contribute 25 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions. Without collective action, this number will likely rise. Food demand is projected&#13;
to increase by at least 20 percent globally over the next 15 yearsâ&#128;&#148;with the largest increases&#13;
expected in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asiaâ&#128;&#148;and a climate-smart food sys-&#13;
tem is urgently needed.&#13;
&#13;
We must have a greater push to support widespread adoption of climate-smart agriculture&#13;
in efforts to secure the triple win of higher agricultural productivity, increased resilience to&#13;
climate change, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank Group is pleased to present â&#128;&#156;Future of Food: Shaping a Climate-Smart&#13;
Global Food System,â&#128;&#157; at the 2015 Annual Meetings being held in Lima, Peru. The report&#13;
aims to help improve the productivity and resilience of the current food system, and to make&#13;
agriculture part of the solution to climate change.&#13;
&#13;
It presents compelling evidence and new tools for policymakers, serving as a guide to better&#13;
address the impacts of a warming climate on agriculture and food production. As the interna-&#13;
tional community works toward the new Sustainable Development Goals, the nexus of food&#13;
security, productivity, and climate change must come into sharper focus. This report argues&#13;
that climate-smart agriculture is central to efforts to end extreme poverty by 2030 and boost&#13;
shared prosperity.&#13;
&#13;
We at the World Bank Group are committed to working with our partners to shape a global&#13;
food system that feeds all and creates a healthier, more prosperous, and sustainable world.&#13;

&amp;#12;summary and key messages&#13;
&#13;
Attaining a significant share of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) rests upon&#13;
the ability to ensure the food system is productive, resilient, and contributes to tackling cli-&#13;
mate change. The growing body of operational experience implementing Climate-Smart&#13;
Agriculture (CSA) points to a large spectrum of approaches that deliver productivity and&#13;
resilience gains alongside lower emissions. This paper advocates for an increasing shift toward&#13;
securing a triple win by implementing agriculture and food production practices that not only&#13;
boost productivity but also enhance resilience and lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)â&#128;&#148;&#13;
the three pillars that form the basis of CSA.&#13;
&#13;
Key messages&#13;
â&#128;¢	   Meeting the rising demand for food and ending hunger and food insecurity requires a&#13;
     climate-smart food system that improves agricultural productivity, has greater resil-&#13;
     ience to climate change and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Droughts, floods and ris-&#13;
     ing temperatures are already cutting crop yields, threatening food, fish and meat supply and&#13;
     pushing people deeper into poverty. Climate change and the effects of climate shocks are&#13;
     dampening the prospects for future productivity growth. Agriculture and land use changes&#13;
     already contribute 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. A more climate-smart food sys-&#13;
     tem is urgently needed to address these challenges.Â Â &#13;
â&#128;¢	   There is a growing spectrum of interventionsâ&#128;&#148;policies, practices and innovationsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
     that must help secure the triple win of higher agricultural productivity, increased resil-&#13;
     ience to climate change and lower emissions. But in a world of constrained resources,&#13;
     prioritization of investments in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is crucial. New tools&#13;
     are available that can help policy makers and stakeholders assess opportunities, balance&#13;
     trade-offs and facilitate identification of entry points for smart, targeted interventions&#13;
     and more efficient investments.&#13;
â&#128;¢	   The new Sustainable Development Goals to end global poverty and hunger by 2030&#13;
     offer a major opportunity to place the need for a climate-smart food system at the&#13;
     front and center of the development agenda and debate. This paper calls on the devel-&#13;
     opment community, scientists, investors, and civil society to rally behind governments&#13;
     and farmers to support integrated approaches and overcome barriers to adoption of CSA.&#13;
&#13;
First, the paper highlights why ensuring a more climate-smart food system is needed; second,&#13;
it identifies what practices and approaches can help accomplish this endeavor and offers a&#13;
guide on how these can be better prioritized at the country level; and third, it focuses on&#13;
how these improved practices and approaches can be more broadly developed and adopted&#13;
through improved incentives, knowledge, science, and finance.&#13;

living in extreme poverty fell from 1.9 billion   and nearly two-thirds of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poor&#13;
in 1990 to an estimated 900 million today.        people work in agriculture. Food demand is&#13;
                                                  projected to rise by at least 20 percent glob-&#13;

&amp;#12;     Synergies between greater efficiency and sustainable use of&#13;
     land, water, and inputs leading to CSA&#13;
     Farmers in China currently apply approximately 200 pounds of fertilizer per acre on average,&#13;
     whereas farmers in Africa apply less than 100 pounds on average. If application rates could be&#13;
     reduced in China and increased in Africa, the net impact could be an extra 175 million tons of&#13;
     food produced in Africa and a reduction of up to 360 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent&#13;
     (CO2-e) in Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s emissions (and reduced farming costs).i&#13;
     If alternative wetting and drying could be expanded to 100 percent of eligible areas globally,&#13;
     water consumption in agriculture could be cut by 30 percent, 200 million tons of CO2-e emis-&#13;
     sions could be avoided, 65 million more tons of rice could be produced, and farmer incomes&#13;
     could be increased.ii&#13;
     The FAO estimates that emissions from livestock can be reduced by between 18 and 30 per-&#13;
     cent concurrent with an increase in productivity if producers in given production systems and&#13;
     geographies adopt the practices currently used by the 10 percent of producers with the lowest&#13;
     emissions intensity.iii&#13;
     Intensification needs to be complemented by policy planning, regulations, pricing, and finan-&#13;
     cial incentive mechanisms to promote sustainable landscape and watershed management and&#13;
     reduce the added pressure from extensification that the gains in productivity may facilitate.&#13;

Climate-Smart Agriculture Delivering Results in India&#13;
Livestock: A government program to support the national dairy sector improving animal feed, nutrition and&#13;
fodder development is under way in climatically vulnerable agro-ecological regions in 15 states. The program&#13;
boosts cattle productivity by promoting breeds that are resilient and adapted to local conditions and promotes&#13;
improved animal nutrition through the Ration Balancing Program. Feed costs and methane emissions both&#13;
fell by 12 percent, a healthier and more productive pool of cattle is making the system more climate-resilient,&#13;
and at least one-third of the beneficiary farmers are women.&#13;

Climate-Smart Agriculture Helps Feed More People in Senegal&#13;
Senegal is building a more resilient and productive food system that also helps mitigate climate change through&#13;
the West Africa Agriculture Productivity Program (WAAPP). Scientists have developed seven new high-yielding,&#13;
early maturing, and drought-resistant varieties of sorghum and pearl millet adapted to local growing conditions.&#13;
On average, the new varieties yield 1.5 to 2 tons per hectareâ&#128;&#148;significantly more than the 0.5 ton per hectare&#13;
yields that are the norm from traditional varieties. The seeds have been distributed to farming cooperatives&#13;
around the country, which have been charged with producing more seeds and selling them back at a price&#13;
higher than the market standard. Farmers around the country are also taught climate-smart planting techniques&#13;

Climate-Smart Agriculture Cuts Emissions in Bangladesh&#13;
Through Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) funding, the World Bank is promoting an&#13;
approach that incorporates the use of optimal and timely use of new rice seeds, new fertilizer, and the implemen-&#13;
tation of new water management (including the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) approach that saves water&#13;
and offers other important benefits such as human disease control). The project funds â&#128;&#156;farmer field schoolsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
to demonstrate the projectâ&#128;&#153;s benefits to farmers in target villages. The AWD technique makes use of the cycle&#13;
of draining and re-flooding of rice paddies, keeping an optimum water level at any particular time. It typically&#13;
takes 2,000 liters of water to produce a kilogram of rice; however, AWD can reduce water use by 25 percent. AWD&#13;
also helps reduce GHG emissions, specifically methane, by up to 50 percent. This project also supports reduced&#13;
fertilizer use by promoting deep placement of fertilizer and precision applicationâ&#128;&#148;leading to a significant drop&#13;
in methane emissions. Used in combination with soil and water conservation, these practices deliver adaptation&#13;
and mitigation benefits in crop, livestock systems and fisheries.&#13;

stock, and honey) and vice versa. Intercropping promoted through           Mexico.&#13;
this collaboration has helped to boost incomes and fight hunger&#13;
in the coffee lands while delivering adaptation and mitigation ben-&#13;
efits in part of Nicaragua and in Chiapas state, Mexico. Diversified production systems have helped boost the&#13;
resilience of farmer incomes throughout the year, while fruit trees provide shade, boosting resilience to drought&#13;
and heat, and absorb carbon.&#13;

Improving Livestock Productivity and Curbing Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon&#13;
In Brazil, mitigation of emissions from the livestock sector has become the centerpiece of a national strategy&#13;
to achieve voluntary targets for GHG mitigation. Brazil committed to reduce deforestation in the Amazon and&#13;
the Cerrado, scale up no-till planting, and reduce nitrogen emissions from farming. Total pledges will reduce&#13;
emissions by 700 million tons CO2-eq by 2020 within ten years. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency program pro-&#13;
vides a credit line for loans to farmers to finance a range of mitigation practices to meet pledgesâ&#128;&#148;intensifying&#13;
livestock production, restoring degraded grasslands, and integrating livestock and crop farming systemsâ&#128;&#148;that&#13;
also strengthen resilience to drought. Cattle productivity has been growing since 2004 alongside impressive&#13;
reduction in deforestation. This is also a triple win.&#13;
