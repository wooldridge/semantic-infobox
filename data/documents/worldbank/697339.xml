Project Description:    The aim of the project is to improve health outcomes by giving&#13;
provinces,  districts  and  puskesmas  managers  greater&#13;
responsibility, authority, resources, and skills to enhance health&#13;
care quality and equity. Specific project objectives are: (i) to&#13;
increase the authority and capacity of provincial and district&#13;
health offices and health centers to plan and implement health&#13;
programs as they deem appropriate to local conditions; (ii) to&#13;
ensure that the provision and consumption of key health&#13;
services conform to affordable, cost-effective standards of care;&#13;
(iii) to improve access and utilization of these health services by&#13;
the poor; and (iv) to improve efficiency in the delivery of basic&#13;
health services (BHS).&#13;
The project, which would be implemented in the provinces&#13;
of West and East Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, West&#13;
Sumatra, and East Java, would operate through three&#13;
mechanisms.  First, it would seek to improve the work&#13;
processes, attitudes and skills within publicly managed BHS&#13;
facilities, while providing the additional resources needed to&#13;
render higher quality, more accessible services that fit the needs&#13;
and demand of clients. A key element is the establishment of&#13;
quality assurance (QA) processes and supporting training&#13;
programs.&#13;
Second, to facilitate these changes, the project would&#13;
strengthen the institutional capability of provinces and districts&#13;
to supervise, support and reward frontline providers of care;&#13;
and simultaneously make managers of districts and facilities&#13;
more accountable for their performance.&#13;
Third, the project would support resource mobilization and&#13;
a reorientation of government spending to BHS and poverty&#13;
alleviation.  Indicative targets have been agreed, increasing&#13;
government health spending for BHS and the poor.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:     By improving the delivery and quality of BHS, the project&#13;
would increase the number of people utilizing them and&#13;
benefiting from their use. Covering about 886 health centers,&#13;
HP IV could benefit an estimated 27 million people. Of these,&#13;
about 20 percent are poor and another 13 percent are near-&#13;
poor. While all demographic groups could benefit from the&#13;
project, the major beneficiaries are expected to be women and&#13;
children from both poor and non-poor families. The poor,&#13;
however, would benefit from the project disproportionately, as&#13;
subsidies for health centers and their outreach activities are&#13;
strongly pro-poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Hii -&#13;
The project has two salient risks. First, increasing cost-&#13;
recovery rates to appropriate levels might be delayed in some&#13;
districts, given that price increases for publicly provided&#13;
services represent a politically sensitive decision. Second, the&#13;
training activities sponsored by the project could become&#13;
burdensome on staff and disruptive of their work.&#13;
These risks have been reduced during project preparation&#13;
by ensuring that enough funds have been allocated for the&#13;
promotion of price reforms and that both provincial, district and&#13;
central officials are committed to them. Evidence for this&#13;
commitment is shown by their involvement in advancing this&#13;
aspect of the project and by the decrees issued by Bupati (head&#13;
of district government) of starter districts expressing support for&#13;
price adjustments. As to training, the project would emphasize&#13;
distance learning and other on-the-job approaches. It would&#13;
also establish mechanisms for controlling the number of days&#13;
staff are away from work to attend off-the-job training.&#13;

CHAPTER 1&#13;
HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. NATIONAL HEALTH TRENDS&#13;
1.1         During its first 25-year development plan (1968/69-1993/94), Indonesia&#13;
achieved sustained economic growth rate averaging over 6 percent annually, and, in the&#13;
process, reduced the poverty rate and the total number of poor people. During this period,&#13;
Indonesia also registered advances in the health sector. The extent of improvement in&#13;
health outcomes in the country is seen in the decline of infant mortality rate (IMR) from&#13;
an estimated 145 per thousand live births in 1967 to 63 per thousand in 1990. A related&#13;
indicator, life expectancy at birth, rose from 45.7 years to 62 years during the same&#13;
period.  In addition, nutritional status improved, as illustrated by the decline in the&#13;
prevalence of protein energy malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency.&#13;
1.2         As the economy grew, govermment was able to expand the number of&#13;
facilities and the availability of modern health services throughout Indonesia. At the&#13;
beginning of Repelita I, there were 1,227 health centers (Puskesmas). By 1993, their&#13;
number reached 6,954, and there were also 19,977 health subcenters (Pustu). On average,&#13;
there is now one health center per 27,000 people compared to about one per 96,000 in&#13;
1968. Complementing this expansion of health facilities has been a rapid increase in the&#13;
number of doctors, nurses, midwives and other health professionals relative to population&#13;
size. Private provision of health services also expanded considerably, especially in urban&#13;
and peri-urban areas in Java and Bali.&#13;
1.3         As a result of increased accessibility of modern health care (combined with&#13;
higher fanily incomes and education), utilization of modem curative and preventive health&#13;
services is greater today than in the past. For example, utilization of modern providers&#13;
when sick has risen considerably among the poorest deciles in rural and urban areas, and&#13;
in both Java and the Outer Islands. The use of certain preventive health measures such&#13;
as modern family planning has also increased at a rapid rate.  For instance, the&#13;
contraceptive prevalence rate among married women of reproductive age rose to 55&#13;
percent in 1994 from 10 percent in the 1960s, facilitating the reduction of total fertility&#13;
rate from 6.61 children in 1971 to 2.90 in 1994.&#13;
1.4         Despite these successes, Indonesia lags behind its comparator countries in&#13;
health development and substantial gaps remain in the delivery of basic health services.&#13;
After a sharp decline in the 1970s, IMR appears to have stabilized in the mid and late&#13;
1980s at 75-80 deaths per thousand births. Current estimates suggest that IMR remains in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
countries like China and Sri Lanka. Maternal mortality risks and malnutrition among&#13;
children remain high, and access to safe water and sanitation facilities by the poor&#13;
continues to be a major concern.&#13;
B. PROVINCIAL BACKGROUND&#13;
1.5          Indonesia's provinces have shared to a greater or lesser extent in economic&#13;
growth, improved access to modern health services and infant mortality rate decline. The&#13;
country's regional differences and commonalities are illustrated in the provinces included&#13;
in the project. As described below (see Table 1.1), these provinces must contend with&#13;
distinctive epidemiological and service delivery problems. (For a discussion of the choice&#13;
of these provinces, see para. 3.2). However, they also face comparable service delivery&#13;
challenges, including the need to improve quality of care within a common health care&#13;
system. A second challenge is that of raising spending on basic health services, especially&#13;
for the poor.&#13;
1.6          East Java. This province, with the second largest population in Indonesia,&#13;
had an infant mortality rate of about 64 deaths per thousand live births and a life&#13;
expectancy at birth of about 63.9 years in 1990. With an average poverty rate of about&#13;
20.5 percent, East Java (Jatim) has over 7 million poor people (a fifth of Indonesia's&#13;
poor).&#13;
1.7         In Jatim, communicable and infectious diseases, particularly diarrhea and&#13;
respiratory infections, remain important causes of mortality and morbidity. Maternal&#13;
mortality is high at 425 per thousand live births, suggesting continuing needs in the&#13;
reproductive area. Moreover, malnutrition is common: more than half of pregnant women&#13;
have anemia and iodine deficiency is endemic in 38 percent of villages.&#13;
1.8          East Java has an extensive network of health centers and associated&#13;
subcenters, as seen in the relatively small average catchment area (Table 1. 1) and the&#13;
availability of doctors. Data show that almost all health centers have doctors. On the&#13;
whole, these facilities are highly utilized -- the average number of daily visits to health&#13;
centers is among the highest in the country and health centers. Significant gaps, however,&#13;
remain in the use of certain basic health services (BHS) by relevant population groups. For&#13;
example, of the children under five years old, 10.7 percent had diarrhea in the past two&#13;
weeks prior to a survey in 1994, and many of them did not get needed oral rehydration&#13;
therapy. In Probolinggo municipality (an urban area), less than half of pregnant women&#13;
completed, the full cycle of recommended visits, compared to the provincial rate of 68&#13;
percent.&#13;
1.9          Another aspect of the BHS gap is the low quality of health care being&#13;
provided.   A  pilot study (Annex  14), using quality assurance (QA) techniques,&#13;
demonstrates the low rate of compliance with recommended technical standards of care in&#13;
the management of acute respiratory infections (39 percent), antenatal care (66 percent),&#13;
and vaccination (74 percent). Patient counselling, history taking and physical examination&#13;
were found to be technically inadequate, decreasing the effectiveness of basic health&#13;

services in East Java. These findings indicate the need to establish quality assurance&#13;
systems in health facilities.&#13;
1.10        In regard health financing, consolidated public expenditures data (Table 1.1)&#13;
suggest that recurrent government spending per capita amounted to only about two dollars.&#13;
This is considerably less than the amount needed to finance the provision of essential&#13;
health services recommended by the 1993 World Development Report.&#13;
1.11        West Kalimantan. This province, which has the highest poverty rate in the&#13;
country (33.8 percent), registered a decline in infant mortality in the last decade and gains&#13;
in education and other socioeconomic indicators. Moreover, despite its high poverty rate,&#13;
West Kalimantan (Kalbar) has achieved a lower IMR (about 81 in 1990) than many&#13;
provinces with lower rates of poverty.&#13;
1.12        Kalbar provides a sharp contrast to East Java in regard to geographic-,&#13;
environmental and other characteristics. It is one of the largest provinces in the country&#13;
(after Irian Jaya and East Kalimantan), but it has one of the smallest populations (3.2&#13;
million in 1990). Over 50 percent of the population live along rivers. Few roads exist and&#13;
transportation and communications are difficult. In addition, environment sanitation is poor&#13;
and safe water supply is not available for half of the population.&#13;
1.13        The main health problems of the province continue to be high infant and&#13;
child mortality from diarrheal disease, respiratory infections, tetanus, and malnutrition, and&#13;
high maternal and perinatal mortality due to inadequate antenatal care, poor management&#13;
during labor and delivery, unhygienic birthing conditions and poor nutritional status.&#13;
Anemia is prevalent as a result of iron folate deficiency and of malaria and other parasitic&#13;
diseases. Diarrhea in West Kalimantan is the highest in the five project provinces,&#13;
reflecting the need for improvements in water and sanitation. Malaria and tuberculosis&#13;
remain common and are a major cause of adult mortality; Dengue fever and hepatitis are&#13;
endemic and widespread through much of the province.&#13;
1.14        The number of health centers per person in Kalbar is higher than the&#13;
national average. However, the average catchment area is sixteen times larger than that in&#13;
East Java. The difficulty of transportation and the sparsity of the population in West&#13;
Kalimantan explain why relatively fewer people visit these facilities. These facts also point&#13;
to the difficulty of providing basic health referral services and the need to adapt&#13;
Indonesia's standard service delivery model. Data show that over 60 percent of women&#13;
deliver at home without a trained birth attendant. A fifth of pregnant women receive no&#13;
prenatal care -- this figure is almost twice that in East Kalimantan. These findings are not&#13;
surprising considering that 60 percent of villages have no midwives.&#13;
1.15        Quality of health services is also a key concern. Standards of care are not&#13;
clear to health staff (for example, many midwives lack the knowledge and skills for high&#13;
quality antenatal care). About 80 percent of health centers have no laboratory technicians&#13;
and less than 40 percent of needed equipment are available in health staff centers.&#13;
Moreover, a high percentage of doctors are inexperienced with less than two years in their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
current assignment. Primary health care providers have inadequate knowledge in health&#13;
education and rational drugs use.&#13;
1.16         Funding for basic health services is inadequate, given the high cost of&#13;
service delivery in Kalbar arising from transportation problems. The total per capita budget&#13;
for BHS is only 65 percent that of East Kalimantan.&#13;
1.17         East Kalimantan. As with Kalbar, East Kalimantan (Kaltim) is a large and&#13;
sparsely populated province with a density that is one percent of that in East Java. Health&#13;
centers in Kaltim  cover about 1,607 sq. km. on average, compared to East Java's&#13;
54 sq. km. In 1990 about half of the population lived in urban areas, leaving the other&#13;
half of the population in the province's vast rural area. East Kalimantan is rich in natural&#13;
resources with the highest per capita provincial income. Kaltim's poverty rate is only half&#13;
that of Kalbar and its IMR is 58 compared to 81 per 1,000 live births in Kalbar.&#13;
1.18         As in East Java where the highly urbanized areas are now exhibiting non-&#13;
traditional morbidity profiles due to demographic transition, East Kalimantan is beginning&#13;
to encounter the costly chronic and degenerative disease problems associated with higher&#13;
income areas. These morbidity patterns are emerging before Kaltim has adequately reduced&#13;
the infectious and acute diseases of developing areas.  Cardiovascular disease, for&#13;
example, has now become the leading cause of death. Yet, infectious and parasitic&#13;
diseases continue to account for more than half of all reported episodes of disease and&#13;
deaths. Tuberculosis remains a major health problem and chloroquine-resistant malaria&#13;
is increasing.&#13;
1.19         Despite its large catchment area, basic health services are more available in&#13;
East Kalimantan than in West Kalimantan -- and even East Java in some respects. Kaltim&#13;
has more health centers and doctors per capita. Its immunization rate is the highest in&#13;
Indonesia. Moreover, Kaltim has already pursued reforms in drugs management,&#13;
decentralized planning and budgeting, and resource mobilization. And of the five project&#13;
provinces, East Kalimantan has the highest public expenditures for health per capita&#13;
including large contributions by local governments.&#13;
1.20         Still, there are notable gaps in the provision and funding of basic health&#13;
services. The coverage of maternal child health (MCH), for example, for safe delivery is&#13;
estirnated to be only 65 percent in 1993. Kaltim has difficulty keeping experienced doctors&#13;
and paramedics in remote areas. As in other provinces, more needs to be done to improve&#13;
the quality of services and improve staff motivation to ensure compliance with standards&#13;
of care. Finally, providing adequate services to the rural population will require even&#13;
larger operational subsidies.&#13;
1.21         Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). The province of NTB, with the country's&#13;
highest recorded infant mortality rate, has also made progress economically and socially.&#13;
In the last five years, NTB along with East Kalirnantan has undertaken pioneering&#13;
institutional improvements, including decentralized and integrated budgeting, drugs&#13;
management, and resource mobilization, which should contribute to accelerated health&#13;
sector development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.22        Despite IMR gains from  187 to 145 per thousand live births and its&#13;
achievements in institutional development, NTB continues to face serious community health&#13;
challenges. The high levels of infant and maternal mortality in the province reflect the&#13;
high prevalence of communicable and infectious diseases -- in particular of tetanus&#13;
neonatorum, acute respiratory infection (ARI), diarrhea, malaria and TB. A part of NTB's&#13;
problem lies in its socioeconomic disadvantages: education is low and poverty rate is high&#13;
compared to other provinces. But maternal health and the quality of all basic health&#13;
services remain problematic as well. Only about 15 percent of births are delivered with&#13;
the assistance of trained birth attendant. Of the five provinces, it also has the highest&#13;
percent of births without antenatal care. In terms of quality of health services, the above-&#13;
mentioned quality assurance pilot study shows that as in East Java compliance rates with&#13;
recommended standards of care (Annex 14) are also low: 45 percent (antenatal care), 45&#13;
percent (ARI) and 60 percent (vaccination).&#13;
1.23        With respect to the issue of funding, the amount spent on health by the&#13;
public sector is almost only half of that in Kaltim despite recent increases in expenditures,&#13;
indicating the need to further increase BHS funding (Table 1. 1).&#13;
1.24        West Sumatra. West Sumatra (Sumbar) is less urbanized than the other&#13;
provinces except for NTB. Its educational level and income, however, are even higher than&#13;
East Java, and its poverty rate is lower. The number of health centers per thousand&#13;
population is also higher. Yet, Sumbar's IMR is about the same as that of East Java.&#13;
1.25        Communicable and infectious diseases continue to dominate Sumbar's&#13;
epidemiological profile. These include ARI, TB, diarrhea, immunizationable diseases,&#13;
malnutrition and pregnancy-related health problems. Immunization coverage needs to be&#13;
increased and Maternal and Child Care services, malaria and ARI control and nutritional&#13;
programs expanded further. To date, West Sumatra has one of the lowest immunization&#13;
rates in the country. Moreover, the percentage of pregnant women with anemia is quite&#13;
high at 72.5 percent and many of them have not received antenatal care. Furthermore, a&#13;
large proportion of births are unattended by health professionals.&#13;
1.26        Field visits also revealed that the quality and utilization of its basic health&#13;
services also need to be improved. As in East Java and NTB, recommended standards of&#13;
care are often not followed and frontline health providers need to learn quality assessment&#13;
and problem-solving techniques to increase the effectiveness of Sumbar's health system.&#13;
C. HEALTH SECTOR ISSUES AND CHALLENGES&#13;
1.27        Systemic Problems.  As mentioned, despite differences in mortality and&#13;
morbidity levels and epidemiological agendas, the project provinces face similar service&#13;
delivery challenges, including the need to improve performance and quality of care within&#13;
the common health care delivery system. As with other line ministries, there are provincial&#13;
health offices (Kanwil Kesehatan) and district health units (Kandep) directed by the central&#13;
Ministry of Health (MOH) which pass along and enforce centrally set policy guidelines and&#13;
prepare health budgets. Routine service delivery matters are directed by health offices,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Dinas Kesehatan I and Dinas Kesehatan II, that have been established under the provincial&#13;
and district administrations, respectively. Within each district, services are actually&#13;
delivered by a network of health centers (puskesmas) and associated sub-centers and&#13;
outreach programs. Services are financed by funds channeled to local health offices and&#13;
implementing units. Funds flow through at least ten separate budgetary channels, each&#13;
with its own regulations and monitoring arrangement. Central government assistance is&#13;
still specified and controlled by the different divisions in the central MOH, which is also&#13;
largely responsible for training, hiring and deploying the health work force.&#13;
1.28         As mentioned, health system efficiency is generally low, as evidenced by&#13;
the underutilization of government facilities and staff in some facilities. For example, in&#13;
West and East Kalimantan the number of visits to health centers averaged only about 31&#13;
or less per day in 1991. On the other hand, centers in East Java recorded, on average,&#13;
about 75 visits per day.&#13;
1.29         Variable health center performance, as evidenced by relatively low&#13;
utilization levels, is attributable to several factors, including availability of resources; staff&#13;
competence, attitudes and behavior; and established operating procedures and processes.&#13;
A common problem in the five provinces is the shortage of funds and materials for&#13;
operations and maintenance. Health centers may not have reliable and timely access to&#13;
drugs and laboratory materials, two key determinants of service quality and facility&#13;
utilization. Also, follow-up and basic referral services especially in poor and remote&#13;
communities often can not be conducted in accordance with recommended practice because&#13;
operational funds (e.g., for travel) are not sufficient.&#13;
1.30         These shortages in materials and operational funds in the five provinces are&#13;
due to the inadequate resources allocated to basic health services (BHS). From a national&#13;
perspective the low budget allocation is partly due to the health sector's low absorptive&#13;
capacity. It is estimated that current per capita public expenditures for health overall are&#13;
one-half or less of the cost of delivering a minimum package of health services to all&#13;
Indonesians (using the 1993 World Development Report suggested package for low income&#13;
countries as a benchmark).&#13;
1.31         But other factors, particularly those relating to institutional capacity and&#13;
organizational culture also contribute to performance problems. For example, service&#13;
quality is affected by lack of sensitivity to clients, inefficient work processes, poor&#13;
management, and weak performance incentives. These weaknesses can make government&#13;
health facilities less attractive and accessible to clients. The limited time spent by&#13;
physicians with patients, inadequate counselling efforts, and the inflexibility of facility&#13;
service hours are all telltale indicators. A related problem that has been documented in&#13;
East Java and NTB is variable compliance with technical standards of care. Staff may not&#13;
be clear about case management protocols, and know little about quality assessment and&#13;
problem-solving methodologies. And, current assessment mechanisms and supervision&#13;
practices often do not provide the feedback and assistance needed to improve service&#13;
performance. Consequently, diagnoses may be unreliable and treatment ineffective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
1.32        Finally, health centers are sometimes poorly managed, while staff may have&#13;
insufficient incentives to provide high quality care and reach out to prospective clients.&#13;
Facility managers (doctors) often are unable to sufficiently guide health workers on case&#13;
management protocols, data analysis, problem-solving and use of staff time. Health center&#13;
managers do not have much power over priority setting and resource allocation.&#13;
Consequently, they lack the motivation to develop sensible, locally appropriate plans and&#13;
work out innovative initiatives.&#13;
1.33        A further deficiency in health system performance is that the poor continue&#13;
to lag behind. For example, in 1991 infant mortality for mothers who had completed some&#13;
secondary schools, a reasonable proxy for household income, was one half that for those&#13;
who had not completed primary schools.  This finding applies in the five project&#13;
provinces. The utilization rate of modem health services, including those provided by the&#13;
government, is also less than that of the well-off, as illustrated by survey data on Kaltim&#13;
and NTB.&#13;
1.34        Given the relatively low budgetary allocation for health, government services&#13;
need to be more focused on the needs of the poor. Currently, the poor receive a&#13;
disproportionately low share of overall health subsidies. A 1993 Bank study of the&#13;
incidence of the health spending showed that the amount of subsidy per capita going to the&#13;
top income decile is about three times that of the lowest decile. This is due in part to the&#13;
substantial share of health spending going to hospital services that are used mostly by the&#13;
well-off.&#13;
1.35        Improving Performance. Given its mixed record of success, the question&#13;
is whether the government health system in the five provinces can meet the various health&#13;
challenges facing the country. Fortunately, there are indications that the system can be&#13;
improved and that publicly managed health facilities can provide better quality care. As&#13;
mentioned (para. 1.28), there are numerous districts in which average facility utilization&#13;
rate is very high.  In addition, field visits revealed that there are health centers in&#13;
Indonesia that are well-managed and highly utilized, despite budgetary and other&#13;
institutional constraints. Second, the experience of Third Health Project in NTB and&#13;
Kaltim suggests that even partial steps towards decentralization, giving greater&#13;
responsibility and authority to district managers, can have a positive impact on health&#13;
sector progress indicators (Chapter 2). Third, a pilot project in NTB and East Java (see&#13;
Annex 14) demonstrates that a modest investment in the establishment of quality assurance&#13;
processes can yield notable improvements in the quality of care. In a short period of less&#13;
than a year, compliance with recommended standards of care increased dramatically, and&#13;
clinics began to take steps to address client satisfaction issues.&#13;
1.36        These observations imply that further progress in health can be achieved by&#13;
improving public provision of services. To realize this expectation, however, will require&#13;
changes in work processes, staff motivation, budgetary focus, and institutional capacity.&#13;
1.37        Facility-level Changes. Improvements are needed, in the first instance, in&#13;
the way service provision is organized at the puskesmas level (including its outreach&#13;
activities). This is a fundamental condition for enhancing the utilization of health services,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
especially among the poor, and the effectiveness and efficiency of care. Raising the&#13;
productivity of frontline workers will require additional funds for health centers and&#13;
changes in the ways service tasks are allocated, carried out and supervised. Facility-level&#13;
managers need to be made responsible for public health services. This means giving them&#13;
the necessary support, incentives, and authority to carry out solutions they deem&#13;
appropriate to their local situation, while at the same time making them accountable. In&#13;
this regard, funds for health centers should not only be adequate, but should be provided&#13;
in a manner that would allow managers the freedom to allocate resources in accordance&#13;
with locally appropriate priorities. This strengthening of managerial authority needs to&#13;
translate into a commitment to team-building and quality improvement, and a greater focus&#13;
on client needs, demands and outcomes.&#13;
1.38         Such changes in organizational culture can be facilitated through the&#13;
application of quality assurance (QA) mechanisms and procedures. QA is an approach to&#13;
building organizational capacity and culture that focuses on continuous improvement in&#13;
service (product) quality and its ability to satisfy consumer requirements. Institution of&#13;
QA systems has been an element in the success of many firms in various industries and&#13;
services including health care. In Indonesia, some industries and a few hospitals have&#13;
started to apply QA concepts and techniques.&#13;
1.39         In its application to health, quality assurance deals with compliance with&#13;
case management protocols and broader issues regarding efficient provision and utilization&#13;
of services. In practice, QA programs involve establishing cost-effective standards for&#13;
facility services; building capacity for data-based "systems analysis" (which means&#13;
enabling staff to methodically investigate problems in quality issues and systemic&#13;
processes); enhancing skills and authority to solve problems and learning appropriate&#13;
lessons from their experience; cultivating team work; and facilitating client feedbacks and&#13;
community participation to improve patient satisfaction.&#13;
1.40         More Effective Supervision and Support. To facilitate and reinforce&#13;
facility-level changes, support from the provincial and district management will now have&#13;
to focus on expediting and motivating the work of frontline providers of care. The change&#13;
in responsibilities and the agenda for those working at this level will require enhanced&#13;
provincial and regional decision-making authority and capacity, and changes in supervisory&#13;
culture, learning opportunities and incentives. To this end, the first step will be to extend&#13;
the decentralization measures that have been successfully piloted in Kaltim and NTB by&#13;
the Third Health Project.&#13;
1.41         In addition, the supervision system will have to move away from the&#13;
established inspection approach towards facilitation and coaching of subordinates on ways&#13;
to improve services. Supervisors, for example, need to focus on communicating standards&#13;
of care and teaching puskesmas staff how to make reliable assessments of the care they&#13;
provide. Meanwhile, monitoring and evaluation data need to be rationalized to enable the&#13;
supervisors to help frontline providers more effectively. Data should include measures of&#13;
service quality, consumer satisfaction and demand, and facility-level resource use and&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
1.42         Better support for frontline providers also means that learning opportunities&#13;
for continuing education, and incentives that reward competency and performance need to&#13;
be established. Current training has low relevance to providers' needs, while reliance on&#13;
off-the-job (residential) training has often been be disruptive of staff work and is quite&#13;
costly. To meet the learning requirements of health facility staff efficiently, it is vital to&#13;
decentralize training activities and plan them in accordance with documented knowledge&#13;
deficits.  It is also important to establish rigorous, regular evaluation of training&#13;
effectiveness; test alternative methodologies such as distance learning that are less&#13;
disruptive of staff work; and institute better control mechanisms for minimizing the&#13;
monetary and opportunity cost of staff training. Furthermore, incentives need to be&#13;
restructured so that they are tied to measures of actual skills improvement, instead of&#13;
encouraging staff to attend off-the-job training.&#13;
1.43         To reinforce the above-mentioned facility-level changes and the ability of&#13;
the district and higher level units to expedite achievement of those improvements, some&#13;
adjustments in MOH's personnel policies will also be required. One change should include&#13;
devolution of decision-making authority to allow district and facility managers to allocate&#13;
manpower resources or their financial equivalent to support their local health service&#13;
improvement plan, including hiring contract (private) providers. These administrators need&#13;
to be made responsible and accountable, initially in pilot areas, for deciding on the number&#13;
of staff, skill mix, in-service training and task assignments within facility budget&#13;
constraints.&#13;
1.44         To ensure that decentralization of decision-making results in higher&#13;
productivity, effective performance assessment mechanisms and incentives need to be put&#13;
in place. Current performance evaluation systems, which are based on self-assessment,&#13;
are ineffectual, and need to be replaced by a credible evaluation systems, which can be&#13;
used in conjunction with schemes for accrediting health centers and rewarding&#13;
performance.&#13;
1.45         Finally, improving support for frontline providers and managers entails&#13;
timely access to drugs and equipment that for practical reasons are more efficiently&#13;
procured by units at the district level or higher.  Lacking an effective inventory&#13;
management system and demand-driven process of ordering, available equipment often&#13;
does not match what health facilities actually need and, as a result, are often unused or&#13;
underutilized. Therefore, in addition to replicating nationally the drugs management&#13;
system (LPLPO) developed by the Third Health Project (HP III), an analogous system for&#13;
equipment management needs to be instituted.&#13;
1.46         Better Resource Allocation and Health Financing. In a recent advance,&#13;
the Integrated DIP (development budget) or DIP Terpadu (an initiative under the Third&#13;
Health Project) gives the Dokabu (health district head) the authority to reallocate resources&#13;
between basic health programs funded through the DIP. Further steps, however, are&#13;
needed to give district and facility managers the authority to reallocate resources between&#13;
expenditure categories and to reduce the number of budgetary channels.  Without&#13;
additional progress towards decentralized and integrated budgeting, accountability for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
health performance will remain diffused, and local health managers will have little&#13;
motivation to initiate service improvement.&#13;
1.47         In addition to improved budgetary processes, increased public funding for&#13;
BHS is needed to ensure that the poor have access to adequate, good quality health&#13;
services. The Repelita VI goal of improving the health status of the poor needs to be&#13;
interpreted in terms of the share of BHS in the health budget. Quantitative targets will&#13;
have to be specified and spending levels regularly monitored, requiring collection and&#13;
analysis of integrated budgetary data. At present, such information is not available.&#13;
Accordingly, a system to routinely track the total amount of resources going to basic health&#13;
services and to evaluate the impact of proposed budgetary decisions on their funding will&#13;
be required.&#13;
1.48         Support for BHS can also come by raising fees for nonessential health&#13;
services provided by public facilities, particularly hospitals, and by permitting greater&#13;
retention of revenues from health service fee. Public facilities currently charge low prices&#13;
for their services. For example, public hospitals charge fees that on average are less than&#13;
30 percent of cost. Local government should be encouraged not only to return all health&#13;
revenues to the sector, but also to guarantee health centers a fraction of their revenues for&#13;
operations and maintenance and staff incentives. Of course, the poor must be protected&#13;
from the impact of price increases. This can be done through: (i) geographic price&#13;
discrimination, charging zero or low fees at facilities serving primarily poor households&#13;
and higher prices at facilities with better-off clients; (ii) individual price discrimination,&#13;
such as giving health fee exemption cards to poor households; (iii) charging differential&#13;
prices at different levels of care to encourage self-selection; and (iv) larger fees for&#13;
identifiable groups of better-off individuals such as civil servants. Pilot activities on price&#13;
adjustments and ways of protecting the poor from fee increases have been conducted in&#13;
Kaltim and NTB and need to be extended to other areas.&#13;
1.49         Finally, expanding health insurance for the better-off may  enable&#13;
government to target more public resources towards the poor. In principle, provision of&#13;
insurance would redirect the insured population towards higher quality private sector&#13;
services, reducing their use of public facilities and increasing the public budget for the&#13;
poor. How best to promote this expansion, however, and address important design issues&#13;
needs to be explored, for example, by testing self-financing prepaid health plans, using&#13;
private providers and capitation payments. Pilot efforts would allow Perum Husada&#13;
Bhakti, the civil servants' health insurance system, to develop ways of reducing its&#13;
dependence on subsidized government services and would give MOH direct experience on&#13;
how to contract private providers to deliver prepaid packages of health services, ensure&#13;
quality of care and deal with enforcement issues.&#13;
D. HEALTH SECTOR PLAN AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.50         The government is aware of the issues of equity and efficiency in health&#13;
system performance, and intends to address them during Repelita VI, the current five year&#13;
development planning period (I 994/95 - 98/99). The objectives and policies of Repelita&#13;
VI are consistent with the steps suggested above to improve health sector performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.51         The general objective of Repelita VI is to raise the health status of the&#13;
population by increasing the quality and scope of health services and by paying greater&#13;
attention to the needs of the poor. It aims to achieve specific targets for infant mortality&#13;
rate, life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality rate, nutritional status and other health&#13;
outcomes which are presented in Annex 9. For example, GOI aims at reducing IMR to&#13;
50 deaths per thousand live births at the end of Repelita VI-current estimates put IMR&#13;
in the 55-60 range.&#13;
1.52         As specified in Repelita VI, the Ministry of Health  would focus on&#13;
improving equity and quality of health services, with particular attention to the poor,&#13;
children, and neglected elderly. To achieve these ends, MOH is to emphasize cost-&#13;
effectiveness in service delivery, by decentralizing health management and decision-making&#13;
authority to provincial and district governments, and through greater mobilization of&#13;
available resources, including non-governmental capabilities. In allocating health budgets,&#13;
MOH is to give priority to highly cost-effective basic health services and interventions that&#13;
directly benefit the poor. The Ministry will also promote intersectoral cooperation through&#13;
improved participation of community, private sector and professional associations.&#13;
1.53         For GOI, the Fourth Health Project (HP IV) represents a vehicle through&#13;
which to test ways of attaining the goals of improving the quality and equity of health care.&#13;
In particular, this project would enable GOI to:&#13;
(a)   Effect facility level changes to raise the level of performance of basic health&#13;
service (BHS) providers, specifically in rendering higher quality BHS and&#13;
reaching out to the poor;&#13;
(b)   Adjust institutional arrangements at the provincial and district levels so that&#13;
frontline providers receive stronger support from higher level staff and&#13;
accountability of both health center and district management is enhanced;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)   Improve health financing by allocating a greater percentage of government&#13;
health spending to highly cost-effective interventions (BHS) and raising the&#13;
share of health benefits of the poor, increasing local government financial&#13;
support for health and raising the rate of retention of revenues from fees for&#13;
health services to support and encourage their improvement, and adjusting&#13;
budgetary arrangements, in particular promoting the use of block grants for&#13;
health services.&#13;

CHAPrER 2&#13;
BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1         The Bank has funded thirteen health projects in Indonesia since 1977. These&#13;
include support for nutrition, community health, health manpower development, water and&#13;
sanitation, referral facilities and family planning initiatives. Bank loans for these projects&#13;
totalled US$602 million. Thirty-eight percent of these loans financed "first generation"&#13;
projects, which consist of loans approved before 1989.&#13;
2.2          These first generation or "start up" projects had a mixed record of success.&#13;
The first four population projects have been implemented satisfactorily and have&#13;
contributed significantly to the success of Indonesia's family planning program. The&#13;
Second Nutrition and Community Health Project (NCH II) also achieved its main&#13;
objectives of promoting "Posyandu", a monthly community-based integrated delivery of&#13;
five high priority health interventions at designated locations. On the other hand, the&#13;
Provincial Health Project and the Second Health (Manpower Development) Project were&#13;
rated as unsatisfactory due to both design and implementation problems.&#13;
2.3         Of the second generation (follow-up) projects, the Third Health Project (HP&#13;
111) is now widely recognized as a well implemented, carefully designed operation. This&#13;
innovative project, which started in 1989 and is now in its last year of implementation, has&#13;
supported empowerment of provincial and district health authorities, management reforms&#13;
and resource mobilization in the provinces of Kaltim and NTB. How HP III has helped&#13;
shape government policy and attitudes towards the above-mentioned issues is discussed&#13;
below. Of the other second generation projects, Third Community Health and Nutrition&#13;
Project (CHN III) and Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project&#13;
(WSSLIC), appear promising but are only in the second year of execution.&#13;
2.4         In addition to sector lending, the Bank has conducted several sector studies&#13;
on health planning and budgeting, health insurance, social expenditures and poverty, and&#13;
the health workforce between 1989 and 1994. Furthermore, analytical work on the health&#13;
sector has been regularly undertaken for the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and&#13;
the Country Assistance Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
B. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.5         First Generation Projects. The following lessons have emerged from the&#13;
experience of the first cohort of health projects:&#13;
(a)   Too rapid expansion of activities can jeopardize quality and lack of attention&#13;
to quality assurance and effectiveness issues seriously limits project impact&#13;
on health outcomes. It is for this reason that despite the rapid expansion of&#13;
Posyandu and the accompanying dramatic increases in immunization,&#13;
nutrition surveillance, and diarrhea control activities, infant mortality rate&#13;
has declined little in the last 10-15 years.&#13;
(b)   A project is likely to be more effective if it is demand-driven. Much of the&#13;
explanation for the failures of the above-mentioned manpower development&#13;
and hospital construction projects can be traced to past disregard of this&#13;
factor. For example, hospital capacity was expanded by 30 percent, when&#13;
there was little effective demand as evidenced by the fact that public health&#13;
facilities in Indonesia were widely underutilized.&#13;
(c)   Right from the start, project preparation and design should maximize&#13;
ownership by concerned agencies and policy-makers to ensure timely and&#13;
effective implementation. This is a key characteristic of the successful&#13;
population projects and the prime factor for NCH II's satisfactory and&#13;
timely completion-achieved despite unanticipated problems of counterpart&#13;
funding and other initial difficulties delaying project implementation.&#13;
2.6         Second Generation Projects. From the recent group of projects, the most&#13;
important lessons derive from the experience of HP III. The greatest success of HP III&#13;
has been the introduction of a process of institutional reforms that have had as a focus&#13;
strengthening the provincial and district health offices' role in health program&#13;
implementation.   These reforms include measures for decentralization  and drug&#13;
management, which have been accepted for national replication in Repelita VI.&#13;
2.7          Provincial and district strengthening was achieved by developing the&#13;
following instruments:&#13;
(a)   the Integrated Health Plan and Budget (IHPB). This is a consolidated&#13;
framework depicting all flows of funds to health programs in the sector;&#13;
(b)   the Integrated DIP or DIP Terpadu and the Basic Health Service Package.&#13;
This is the consolidation of the central budgets (DIPs) for community health&#13;
into a single budget for high priority basic health services.&#13;
(c)   transfer of budget responsibility to the District Health Officer (Dokabu), a&#13;
step that expanded the resource allocation authority of the Dokabu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.8          These measures have engendered a more decentralized planning process with&#13;
provincial, district and puskesmas staff becoming more involved in the process; greater&#13;
flexibility and decision making authority at the local level; and clearer sense of&#13;
accountability and faster flow of funds. In addition, as provincial and district governments&#13;
became more aware of health issues and more involved in their solutions, local funding&#13;
rose dramatically. Furthermore, drugs shortages at the health center have been minimized&#13;
in the HP III provinces, not only because of increased budgetary allocations but also&#13;
because of the development of an innovative system (LPLPO) of drug management and&#13;
supply.&#13;
2.9          Two overall lessons have emerged from these HP III outcomes:&#13;
(a)    First, incremental steps towards decentralization, particularly strengthening&#13;
the responsibility and authority for and the management and delivery of&#13;
health programs at the district level, have had considerable positive impact&#13;
on health sector development.&#13;
(b)   Second, local government involvement is vital to the success of any&#13;
decentralization effort. A substantial "marketing" effort is required from&#13;
the outset of preparation and through project implementation.&#13;
2.10         The achievements of HP III, however, represent just a start towards&#13;
enhancing the capacity and organizational culture of health centers and improving support&#13;
from the district and provincial levels of government. Much remains to be done. For&#13;
example, quality of care provided at puskesmas is still deficient in terms of compliance&#13;
with case management protocols, indicating the need for introducing quality assurance&#13;
mechanisms. Furthermore, in spite of the freedom to shift budgets between programs&#13;
included in the DIP Terpadu, district managers are still unable to reallocate these resources&#13;
across categories of expenditures as they see fit. Puskesmas managers also continue to&#13;
follow targets reflecting central level priorities, rather than determining their own priorities&#13;
and allocating their DIP Terpadu budget in accordance with local disease patterns.&#13;
Another lesson, therefore, emerges from HP III experience:&#13;
(c)    Follow-up efforts may be needed to sustain institutional changes and extend&#13;
them to health facilities to achieve more satisfactory levels of health service&#13;
performance.&#13;
2.11         In conclusion, institutional and management advances have occurred in&#13;
Kaltim and NTB, which have already resulted in improved health services. Additional&#13;
efforts, however, are needed to supplement these achievements.  From  the national&#13;
perspective, follow-up projects are needed to facilitate replication of the aforementioned&#13;
innovations in the other provinces. Equally important, the process of experimentation and&#13;
institutional reforms would also have to be broadened to bring changes in other areas that&#13;
are critical for higher health system performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
C. RATIONALE AND STRATEGY FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.12         The health sector is an appropriate area for Bank involvement.  Public&#13;
intervention in the sector is legitimate and necessary to maximize sector efficiency. Many&#13;
basic health interventions have public goods characteristics; moreover, market&#13;
imperfections in the health sector are quite serious due to the asymmetry of information&#13;
between consumers and providers. Some public interventions can also be justified on&#13;
grounds of equity. In particular, Bank analysis show that the provision of basic health&#13;
services is a cost-effective way to alleviate poverty.&#13;
2.13         To realize more fully the benefits from government health interventions,&#13;
GOI needs to make adjustments in its public health system and in its approach to health&#13;
care.  These changes involve a combination of policy changes, revised institutional&#13;
arrangements, strengthening of incentives structures, technical capacity building,&#13;
procedural reforms, and improved health financing.&#13;
2.14         The Bank is well suited to provide the support needed to deal with these&#13;
various issues. First, it is at the forefront in assisting health sector reforms in Indonesia&#13;
and has accumulated relevant knowledge and experience. Its analytical work and recent&#13;
innovative lending operations have dealt with key sectoral issues. Second, the Bank has&#13;
established an excellent partnership with GOI and a credible approach to health sector&#13;
reform. Third, Bank involvement is consistent with its global health development policy&#13;
and its country assistance strategy (CAS) for Indonesia.&#13;
2.15         In this regard, HP IV represents an excellent vehicle for pursuing the&#13;
objective, cited in the CAS, of helping Indonesia overcome human resource bottlenecks&#13;
by strengthening the decentralized management, quality and utilization of basic social&#13;
services. HP IV would contribute to the CAS agenda by:&#13;
(a)   supporting GOI efforts to enable and motivate frontline health providers and&#13;
managers in public facilities to deliver higher quality, more accessible&#13;
services that fit the needs and demands of clients;&#13;
(b)   promoting decentralization and enhancement of capacity of provinces and&#13;
districts to supervise and support lower level managers and staff; and&#13;
(c)   assisting  in  improving  health  financing  by  reorienting  (a) public&#13;
expenditures in health to assure that a larger share of sectoral allocations&#13;
goes to the poor and provision of basic service packages, and (b) sector&#13;
financing mechanisms, with much greater reliance to be placed on direct&#13;
cost recovery and health insurance modalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 3&#13;
THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3. 1         The aim of the project is to improve health outcomes by giving provinces,&#13;
districts and puskesmas managers greater authority, responsibility, resources, and skills&#13;
to enhance health care quality and equity. Specific project objectives are: (i) to increase&#13;
the authority and capacity of provincial and district health offices and health centers to plan&#13;
and implement health programs as they deem appropriate to local conditions; (ii) to ensure&#13;
that the provision and consumption of key health services conform to affordable, cost-&#13;
effective standards of care; (iii) to improve access and utilization of these health services&#13;
by the poor; and (iv) to improve efficiency in the delivery of basic health services (BHS).&#13;
These objectives address key issues that are essential to further health sector development&#13;
and poverty alleviation.&#13;
3.2          The project would cover five provinces: West and East Kalimantan, Nusa&#13;
Tenggara Barat (NTB), West Sumatra (Sumbar), and East Java (Jatim). Except for Jatim,&#13;
all districts in each province would be covered. Fourteen districts in Jatim would be&#13;
included, chosen in accordance with selection criteria that gave highest priority to poverty&#13;
and BHS gap indicators, and commitment to price reforms and facility fee retention for&#13;
operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) and staff incentives. -The choice of the five provinces&#13;
was based on the following considerations. First, Kaltim and NTB were included to&#13;
follow up assistance provided under HP III with additional innovative activities deemed&#13;
necessary to bring about required changes in organizational culture and institutional&#13;
capacity at the facility level. Second, GOI chose the remaining three provinces from those&#13;
that did not have any major donor-assisted health project. Within this group, priority was&#13;
given to those provinces with the worst poverty indicators (Kalbar) and the largest number&#13;
of poor families (East Java).&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3         Project Design. The Fourth Health Project (HP IV) adopts a systems&#13;
approach (see Chart 3.1) to quality and equity improvement and employs various&#13;
mechanisms to bring about facility-level changes and adjustments (described below) at the&#13;
provincial, district and central levels to achieve its objectives. Provincial and district health&#13;
offices would be given enhanced responsibility and authority for planning and&#13;
implementing most of HP IV's activities, including the processing of contracts. The role&#13;
of the Central Ministry would be to provide general guidance and technical assistance and&#13;

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT ASSISTANCE&#13;
hp4-cht3.doc&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
to disseminate innovations and lessons learned from the experience of provinces and&#13;
districts. Fourth Health Project's design is highly cost-effective, compared to other&#13;
alternatives for improving health outcomes and poverty alleviation. First, the basic health&#13;
interventions (currently underutilized) the project would support are highly cost-effective&#13;
relative to other health services, as shown by the 1993 World Development Report.&#13;
Second, a Bank study of the incidence of health subsidy benefits in Indonesia reveals that&#13;
spending on health center and subcenter services, which is currently low, are strongly pro-&#13;
poor compared to other public subsidies.  Hence, reorienting government health&#13;
expenditures towards improving basic health services would not only be efficient but also&#13;
be equitable. Third, a pilot study (see Annex 14) reveals that a modest amount of&#13;
investment in establishing quality assurance processes could lead to considerable&#13;
improvements in quality of care and, hence, in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the&#13;
above-mentioned basic health services.  Fourth, greater efficiency could be achieved&#13;
through the following district, central and facility level changes and mechanisms.&#13;
3.4          Facility-Level Change. The first project mechanism is improvement of&#13;
basic health services provided by puskesmas and, to a limited extent, by district hospitals&#13;
in the five provinces. (In this report, the term puskesmas or health center also refers to&#13;
associated sub-centers and outreach programs.) Here, the agenda is to change the work&#13;
processes, attitudes, skills and other aspects of organizational culture of these facilities,&#13;
while giving them additional resources that would enable the provision of higher quality,&#13;
more accessible services that fit the needs and demands of clients.&#13;
3.5          To this end, the project would introduce and establish facility-level quality&#13;
assurance (QA) processes suitable to the Indonesian situation. The QA program, which&#13;
has been based on lessons from a small pilot project in NTB and East Java (see Annex&#13;
14), would be directed at five areas: technical competence, client satisfaction, efficiency,&#13;
coverage/access, and effectiveness. Health center staff would initially learn to analyze and&#13;
resolve simple problems of non-compliance with clinical standards and would progress to&#13;
more complex issues pertaining to priority-setting and health outcome problems. To&#13;
achieve the aims of this quality assurance program, the project would support on-the-job&#13;
training and encourage self-learning in areas of concern.&#13;
3.6          HP IV would finance expenditures needed to carry out service improvement&#13;
plans drawn up by frontline providers through problem-solving and priority setting&#13;
exercises. For this purpose, a program would be established providing Special Assistance&#13;
Funds (SAF) for health centers. SAFs comprise discretionary resources that puskesmas&#13;
managers could use to purchase eligible expenditure items (mainly for operations) needed&#13;
to initiate and implement their plans. Agreed SAF Operating Guidelines in Annex 10&#13;
present the list of eligible expenditures together with the operating procedures and the&#13;
assignment of oversight responsibility. (Expenditures made through the SAF would be&#13;
referred to in the cost tables below as SAE or Special Assistance Expenditures.)&#13;
Furthermore, additional assistance for improving physical facilities, equipment, and other&#13;
activities needed to reduce BHS quality and coverage gaps would be provided through&#13;
other (less flexible) budgetary arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.7         To maximize their impact, use of the above funds would be concentrated on&#13;
selected basic health interventions that are expected to be highly cost-effective. Annex 13&#13;
presents an initial list of these interventions (Basic Awal). This list would be used during&#13;
the first year of the project and revised on the basis of a more systematic analysis of&#13;
disease burdens and the relative cost-effectiveness of health interventions.&#13;
3.8         Provincial, District, and Central Level Changes. Improvements in the&#13;
current institutional processes and the attitudes and technical assistance capacity of staff&#13;
in health districts and provincial units comprise the second mechanism and agenda.&#13;
Assistance would be geared towards building the ability of provinces and districts to&#13;
supervise, support, and reward frontline providers of care, while at the same time making&#13;
district and facility managers more accountable for their performance.&#13;
3.9          To bring about these changes, HP IV would reorient the way supervisors&#13;
do their job. They would be encouraged to change their role from acting as work&#13;
inspectors (mainly noting bureaucratic shortcomings) to coaches who would help frontline&#13;
staff improve their services, treating them as internal clients and sharing with them&#13;
problem-solving responsibility. In this new role, supervisors would become sources of&#13;
new ideas and conduits for communicating standards of care to puskesmas staff.&#13;
Accordingly, HP IV would provide supervisors learning opportunities to acquire a clear&#13;
understanding of recommended clinical standards, the ability to analyze compliance&#13;
problems and other more complex service quality issues, as well as skills in team-building&#13;
and monitoring. In addition, an evaluation system would be developed whereby frontline&#13;
staff would be able to provide feedback on the effectiveness of their supervisors in&#13;
carrying out their new role.&#13;
3.10        The project would give provincial and district health offices the additional&#13;
funds needed to support the above agenda. Resources would be provided in ways that&#13;
would advance decentralization and make resource allocation decisions more demand-&#13;
driven. Hence, in funding equipment and drugs, the project would institute (prior to major&#13;
purchases of these items) reforms of their inventory and management not only to minimize&#13;
wastage and increase reliability of supply, but also to give provincial, district and facility&#13;
managers a voice in the procurement process to ensure that it is responsive to frontline&#13;
needs.  HP IV training prograns would be decentralized, emphasizing on-the-job&#13;
approaches tailored to address knowledge and skills deficits identified by health staff&#13;
through their QA exercises.&#13;
3.11         Furthermore, discretionary special assistance funds (SAFs) would be&#13;
provided to health districts to finance eligible expenditures they deem necessary (within&#13;
the parameters set out in the SAF Operating Guidelines) to carry out BHS improvements.&#13;
These expenditures would include, inter alia, outlays for supervision, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and redeployment of staff, for which HP IV provinces and districts would be&#13;
given the necessary authority. Through these special assistance funds, HP IV would help&#13;
provinces and health districts establish a track record that could eventually help accelerate&#13;
further budgetary integration and decentralization of resource allocation and personnel&#13;
decisions. During negodations, GOI gave assurances that it would carry out the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
activities under the SAF in accordance with the SAF Operating Guidelines, agreed with&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
3.12        As authority is devolved to provincial, district and frontline managers, HP&#13;
IV would simultaneously strengthen their accountability and enhance their motivation to&#13;
improve health service performance. Accordingly, as part of the quality assurance and&#13;
other initiatives to bring about changes at the provincial and district levels, the project&#13;
would develop new health center accreditation and performance-linked incentive systems.&#13;
These systems would be based on an agreed list of performance indicators (para. 3.41 and&#13;
Annex 3) and linked to various incentives that GOI would like to test. One scheme would&#13;
be for districts with excellent performance to receive their Integrated DIP in a form that&#13;
would increasingly look like a block grant. Another is to raise their SAFs as the districts&#13;
showed greater absorptive capacity, while freezing or reducing that of consistently non-&#13;
performning districts at initial levels until remedial measures have been taken and the latter&#13;
showed evidence that they can absorb additional funds efficiently. In addition, based on&#13;
the experience of Balikpapan and other puskesmas in Kaltim regarding their use of facility&#13;
fees, districts would be encouraged to guarantee staff of accredited health centers a fraction&#13;
of their revenues from health service fees and allow them to use the money for their&#13;
operations and maintenance as well as staff incentives.&#13;
3.13        Finally, to lay the ground for further health system advances, the project&#13;
would support trials of bolder innovations and QA studies (e.g., on standards of care and&#13;
documentation of best practices). In this regard, a limited amount of funds would be&#13;
allocated to finance program development expenditures (PDE) needed to pilot the testing&#13;
of managed care schemes using private providers, a system for their accreditation, MOH&#13;
hiring processes, and other high priority issues specified in the PDE Operating Guidelines&#13;
(see Annex 11). The list of eligible expenditures, the criteria for approval of proposals&#13;
and the process of review are described in these guidelines. During negotiations, GOI&#13;
provided assurances that it would carry out the Program Development activities in&#13;
accordance with the Program Development Expenditures Operatng Guidelines, agreed&#13;
with the Bank.&#13;
3.14        Increased Financial Support for BHS and Poverty Alleviation. The third&#13;
mechanism and agenda are resource mobilization and the reorientation of government&#13;
spending to raise funding of basic health services (BHS). The above initiatives would&#13;
contribute to this agenda by establishing provincial and district capacity to deliver effective&#13;
health services and, thereby, making the health sector an attractive area for public&#13;
investment. These steps are crucial to overcome the reluctance of concerned planning and&#13;
finance officials to boost public spending on health because of their view that the health&#13;
sector does not have the absorptive capacity to use additional funds effectively.&#13;
3.15        HP IV would also encourage increased provincial and district funding of&#13;
BHS by fostering greater local government awareness of health sector issues and&#13;
involvement in their solution. Fees would be increased for non-BHS personal health&#13;
services provided by publicly managed facilities and the return of all health revenues to&#13;
the sector would be promoted. At the same time, measures would be taken to develop and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
institute schemes (e.g., geographic price discrimination or use of health cards for fee&#13;
exemption) to protect the poor from the impact of fee increases.&#13;
3.16        A further step to raise funding of basic health services to the poor is the&#13;
expansion of self-financing health insurance schemes among the better-off, which include&#13;
civil servants, to reduce their dependence on highly subsidized government health services.&#13;
The PDE funds mentioned above would be available to finance such proposals. An&#13;
example of these proposals is building the capacity of Perum Husada Bhakti to develop and&#13;
market self-financing prepaid health plans for the well-off and in the process shift the&#13;
delivery of the civil servants' health insurance benefits to private sector providers.&#13;
3.17        Lastly, HP IV would introduce a budgetary practice of giving more financial&#13;
assistance to health facilities which attend primarily to the needs of the poor than those&#13;
serving the better-off. The SAF would, therefore, be structured so that health centers and&#13;
districts serving primarily poor communities would be allocated relatively more funds.&#13;
This design feature would reinforce the equity impact that might be expected from&#13;
allocating a larger proportion of public funds to basic health services. In Indonesia, the&#13;
incidence of benefits from these services, which are primarily delivered by health centers&#13;
and their subcenters, strongly favor the poor.&#13;
3.18        GOI brought to negotiations a Statement of Policy of the Ministry of Health&#13;
and a Statement of Provincial Government Support for the project, showing the&#13;
commitment of MOH and the Governors of participating provinces to an increase in the&#13;
amount of Central and provincial health subsidies going to the poor as well as to the&#13;
provision of basic health services.  In this regard, annual targets were agreed at&#13;
negotiations for increasing health related public spending for the poor and for basic health&#13;
services.&#13;
3.19        Agreement was also reached with GOI at negotiations, providing for higher&#13;
SAFs per capita for health centers and health districts in poor areas than those in well-off&#13;
areas. Moreover, assurances were provided during negotiations that GOI would: (a) not&#13;
later than December 31, 1995, furnish to the Bank a classification, on the basis of&#13;
poverty issues, of health centers and health districts in the project provinces, as referred&#13;
to in the aforementioned Statement of Policy and Provincial Government Support; (b)&#13;
not later than October 31, 1996, furnish to the Bank guidelines for pricing personal&#13;
health services provided by health centers and hospitals and protecting the poorfrom the&#13;
impact of price adjustments; and (c) not later that October 31, 1996 implement the&#13;
system for the annual collection of consolidated budgetary information to monitor&#13;
achievement of the above-mentioned targets and for assessing the impact of proposed&#13;
central and provincial budgetary allocations on the funding of BHS.&#13;
3.20        Furthermore, assurances were provided by GOI during negotiations that it&#13;
shaUl cause the local governments of the participating provinces to take aU actions&#13;
requiredfor the implementation of the Provincial Government Statement in each district&#13;
selected to participate in the project, including the requirement: (a) that the share of&#13;
distridc health budget going to BHS and the poor be increased annually; (b) that health&#13;
service fees be adjusted upwards and that such revenues be used for purposes of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
health sector; and (c) tW  part of the earnings of the health centers be used by such&#13;
facilites for health center perfornance incenfives.&#13;
3.21         Components. In each province, the project consists of facility-level service&#13;
improvement, institutional development, and resource allocation and revenue generation&#13;
components. (For a detailed description of each component, see Annex 5.) In the facility-&#13;
level service component, funds would be used: (i) to improve the physical facilities of&#13;
health centers, subcenters and, to a limited extent, district hospitals, including support for&#13;
needed equipment, water supply, storage facilities, vehicles and furniture; and (ii) reduce&#13;
the current BHS gaps in quality and coverage by providing discretionary health center&#13;
Special Assistance Funds (SAFs) and other additional resources for operational and&#13;
recurrent costs (on a declining rate) to support implementation of quality assurance and&#13;
other BHS programs initiated by frontline providers.&#13;
3.22         Funds for institutional development would finance improvements in the&#13;
capacity of provincial, district, and Central-level agencies to assist, motivate, and supervise&#13;
frontline health providers in delivering accessible high quality packages of basic health&#13;
services. Specifically, project expenditures would go to: (i) establishing quality assurance&#13;
(including health center accreditation systems) and supporting training/curriculum&#13;
development activities; (ii) developing effective performance-linked incentives systems;&#13;
(iii) financing discretionary district SAFs, replication of HP III innovations, and other pilot&#13;
programs that could lead to improvements in the organizational culture of the public health&#13;
system and its role in the provision of basic health services; and (iv) strengthening the&#13;
capacity of Central-level MOH units to give technical guidance, disseminate quality&#13;
assurance and other HP IV innovations, and carry out oversight functions.&#13;
3.23         Finally, funds would be provided in the resource allocation and revenue&#13;
generation component for technical assistance (TA), data collection and analysis, materials&#13;
and workshops to design and promote facility-level fee increases and revenue retention,&#13;
and institute more effective targeting of health subsidies to appropriate recipients and&#13;
activities. Funds under this component would help MOH: (i) to develop and establish&#13;
mechanisms for monitoring and reporting the total health subsidies going to BHS and the&#13;
poor, especially their corresponding share in Central and local health budgets for the&#13;
nation as a whole and for each of the five provinces; and (ii) to develop a system for&#13;
analyzing annual APBN (National Budget) and APBD (Regional Budget) budgetary&#13;
decisions in terms of the above financial indicators.&#13;
3.24         Provincial Health Improvement Programs. Project activities and outlays&#13;
by province are described below (amounts in parentheses are base costs; see Table 4.1(a)&#13;
for detailed breakdown):&#13;
3.25         East Java (US$23.1 million equivalent): The project would mainly fund&#13;
operational and incremental recurrent costs (73 percent) to meet the drugs and other&#13;
requirements of an expanded BHS coverage program and developmental expenditures (13&#13;
percent) needed to establish quality assurance practices and supporting training programs.&#13;
Over a fifth of Jatim's project cost would finance discretionary SAFs for health centers and&#13;
districts which support GOI's decentralization efforts. Outlays would be directed at existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
deficiencies in the quality and coverage of ten basic health services, which include&#13;
nutrition, maternal and child care/family planning, immunization, health education, control&#13;
of communicable diseases (dengue, malaria, TB, diarrhea, ARI and school health&#13;
services). Other uses of the above amount include inter alia funding of supervision&#13;
improvements and pilot activities involving private health providers, health insurance,&#13;
district-determined redeployment of health staff, the development of performance-linked&#13;
incentives and replication of the drugs management and other HP III innovations.&#13;
3.26         West Kalimantan (US$29.6 million equivalent): A distinctive feature of&#13;
Kalbar's program is its support for technical assistance and other components that would&#13;
address systemic issues arising from the application of Indonesia's conventional health&#13;
delivery system and approaches to an area characterized by non-standard geographic&#13;
configurations. Kalbar's SAFs (30 percent) and budget for QA and supporting activities&#13;
(10 percent) would be the vehicle to enable the province to tailor its approaches to the&#13;
distinctive environment within which its health programs operate. In addition, the project&#13;
would support civil works (40 percent) and equipment provision more heavily than in other&#13;
provinces to improve the physical infrastructure of its publicly managed basic health&#13;
services facilities. Referral facilities for maternal and child services would be strengthened.&#13;
Water and sanitation programs would be improved to reduce the high prevalence rate of&#13;
water-borne diseases.&#13;
3.27         Nusa Tenggara Barat (US$9.0 million equivalent): NTB would further&#13;
develop, expand and institutionalize the quality assurance program that it has successfully&#13;
piloted. In addition, it would try out Referral Health Centers and develop a program to&#13;
enhance the ability of traditional birth attendants (the predominant source of birth delivery&#13;
assistance) to conduct their practice safer and to make timely and appropriate referrals of&#13;
high risk pregnancies. NTB's SAFs (28 percent), quality assurance efforts (15 percent),&#13;
and support for health equipment and recurrent costs for supervision and medical supplies&#13;
(21 percent) would provide funds to promote safe motherhood, child immunization, ARI&#13;
interventions and other BHS activities.&#13;
3.28         East Kalinantan (US$14.5 million equivalent): As in the other provinces,&#13;
the project would support the development of effective systems of performance evaluation&#13;
and associated incentive schemes linked to service improvements in terms of both&#13;
utilization and quality assurance-based indicators. Kaltim would further develop and&#13;
expand its pioneering efforts to use health center fees as a source of extra-budgetary&#13;
resources and incentives for improved service performance by health staff. Like East Java,&#13;
it also plans to use project funds for Program Development Expenditures to pilot a&#13;
managed prepaid health care system in Balikpapan that would utilize private providers of&#13;
health services.&#13;
3.29         However, project funds allocated for this province would be used largely&#13;
to establish quality assurance processes and supporting activities (about 10 percent) and&#13;
finance recurrent costs for health supplies (15 percent), SAFs (23 percent) and equipment&#13;
(17 percent) purchases to address Kaltim's remaining problems of communicable and&#13;
infectious diseases. As in other provinces, the SAFs would not only increase discretionary&#13;
resources available to district offices and health center managers to respond more quickly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
to quality problems documented through the application of QA methodologies; they would&#13;
also be used as a vehicle for developing and instituting a budgetary practice of providing&#13;
extra operational resources for underserved areas. In this regard, East Kalimantan plans&#13;
to initially give poor health districts 50 percent more SAFs per health center than those in&#13;
non-poor areas.&#13;
3.30         West Sumatra (US$27.5 million equivalent): This fund would support:&#13;
(i) the development of an institutionalized QA program; (ii) the expansion of outreach&#13;
activities, particularly in the remote areas; (iii) training to address skills deficits that affect&#13;
quality of care; (iv) expanded supervisory contacts with service providers to facilitate the&#13;
QA program and development of interventions to make these contacts more productive and&#13;
accountable; (v) redeployment of staff to underserved areas; (vi) the provision of adequate&#13;
health supplies and greater availability of functional equipment in health centers; and (vii)&#13;
decentralized problem-solving initiatives by health center, district and provincial managers.&#13;
3.31         Sumbar would use the above funds among others to raise immunization rate&#13;
and utilization of cost-effective health interventions to strengthen MCH services and&#13;
control of communicable and infectious diseases such as ARI, TB, malaria, and diarrhea.&#13;
In this regard, about a quarter of the above funds would finance discretionary SAFs that&#13;
the province can use to expand its BHS programs, especially to poor communities. In&#13;
addition, another third of the US$27.5 million would be allocated for drugs and other&#13;
recurrent costs to meet shortages of supplies. West Sumatra would further spend about&#13;
12 percent to develop the skills of its health staff to analyze and address service utilization&#13;
issues, in addition to technical quality problems.&#13;
3.32         Although training expenditures would be focused on QA methodologies,&#13;
these funds would be used, selectively, to develop programs with clearly defined goals&#13;
expressed in terms of objectively measurable competencies and aimed at addressing staff&#13;
deficiencies in technical skills and knowledge that have been demonstrated to hamper the&#13;
ability of district and frontline health staff to provide effective care. With technical&#13;
assistance from Pusdiklat (the national center for health in-service training), Sumbar also&#13;
plans to use HP IV funds to try out and evaluate innovative approaches such as distance&#13;
learning and on-the-job training to meet the learning needs of health staff. The cost-&#13;
effectiveness of providing incentives based on measured skills and knowledge acquired&#13;
through training or self-learning would be examined and successful innovations would be&#13;
expanded in future years. (Sumbar's training strategy illustrates the approach that the other&#13;
provinces also intend to take to support HP IV's learning requirements.)&#13;
C. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.33         Project management. The Ministry of Health would be the executing&#13;
agency with the Secretary-General as Project Director (Annex 12).  He would be&#13;
responsible for the overall direction of the project and for making decisions on policy&#13;
issues involving the project. He would appoint a Project Officer (the Head of the Bureau&#13;
of Planning, MOH) who with the assistance of a Deputy Project Officer would manage the&#13;
project and would be responsible for all technical and administrative aspects of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
A Project Secretariat with several full-time staff headed by an Executive Secretary would&#13;
manage routine administrative matters. Many HP IV innovations deal with issues outside&#13;
the purview of the Secretary-General and most of them are the responsibility of the&#13;
Director-General for Community Health (DG-CH). Consequently, to ensure smooth&#13;
coordination and timely implementation of HP IV activities, a Central Technical Task&#13;
Force under the leadership of the DG-CH would be established to review and guide key&#13;
technical and policy innovations involving the aforementioned issues.&#13;
3.34        At the provincial level, the Chief of the MOH Provincial Health Office&#13;
(Kanwil) would be the Provincial Project Officer. He would be ultimately responsible for&#13;
all project-related activities in the province. He would be assisted by an Administrative&#13;
Officer (the Head of the Provincial Health Office Planning Division) who would be in&#13;
charge of project administration, specifically reporting, planning, coordination, and&#13;
monitoring of project activities.  A small full-time staff would be assigned to the&#13;
Administrative Officer to assist him in carrying out his project responsibilities. As regards&#13;
activities under Dinkes I (the Provincial Health Services), its head would be the Project&#13;
Implementation Officer. Moreover, a Provincial Technical Task Force, chaired by the&#13;
Provincial Project Officer, with the Head of the Division of Health Services in the&#13;
Provincial Health Office (Kanwil) as first secretary, would be established to monitor and&#13;
guide all technical innovations involved in HP IV with the help of some consultants.&#13;
3.35        The center of gravity of HP IV activities would be at the district level and&#13;
below. The Head of the District Health Office (Dokabu) with the help of a District&#13;
Implementation Officer would be in charge of all HP IV activities at this level and would&#13;
report directly to the Provincial Project Officer. The Dokabu's responsibility includes&#13;
planning and implementation of project activities.  He would also be in charge of&#13;
proposing, testing and evaluating district innovations. A District Health Development&#13;
Committee, an intersectoral team with active participation from the Bupati (Head of&#13;
District Administration) and the head of the district development planning agency&#13;
(BAPPEDA II), would be established to guide the overall development of health within the&#13;
district. Finally, the Head of the Health Center would manage HP IV activities undertaken&#13;
at the facility and would be accountable to the Dokabu.&#13;
3.36        During the course of the project, efforts would be made to develop&#13;
mechanisms to promote active community involvement in health services, with the&#13;
objective of making health providers more accountable to the community they are serving.&#13;
To this end, local government representatives and non-governmental community leaders&#13;
would be mobilized.&#13;
3.37        Channeling of funds. Loan funds would be channeled through the DIP.&#13;
Specifically, these funds would be channeled through the Integrated DIP (locally referred&#13;
to as DIP Terpadu), with the exception of funds to support activities under the Central&#13;
units. The choice of the Integrated DIP, which is a HP III innovation for integrating and&#13;
decentralizing GOI funding of basic health services, is based on its workability. In&#13;
contrast to the usual DIP, which rigidly earmarks funds for specific activities, the&#13;
Integrated DIP is less complex and allows the health district to reallocate resources across&#13;
programs as it sees fit. In this regard, the Dokabu would have the authority to disburse&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

funds and the responsibility for their accounting. The translation of the HP IV COSTAB&#13;
allocations into GOI's budget is easier and their release to implementing units is faster.&#13;
The initial experience of GOI and the Bank regarding the Integrated DIP has been positive.&#13;
Some civil works, however, to be funded 100 percent by GOI would be financed through&#13;
INPRES.&#13;
3.38        Implementation schedule. The project would be implemented for a period&#13;
of five years starting effectively about September 1995. The number of districts and health&#13;
centers that would be provided with special assistance funds (SAFs) and other HP IV&#13;
assistance would be phased according to the schedule laid out in Annex 2. Poor areas&#13;
would be given priority for early coverage.&#13;
3.39        Implementation would begin in two starter districts per province (three for&#13;
East Java) during the first one and a half years of the project. By focusing initially on a&#13;
few districts, the collaborating agencies would have the time to lay out a solid foundation&#13;
for accelerated project implementation in later years.&#13;
3.40        The first one and a half years would focus on: (i) provision of technical&#13;
assistance; (ii) finalizing the detailed design of QA, training and other components; (iii)&#13;
putting in place supporting policy actions; (iv) conducting orientation workshops and social&#13;
marketing key project messages; (v) establishing the necessary implementation&#13;
arrangements, including the institution of the drugs (LPLPO) and equipment management&#13;
system and Integrated Planning and Budgeting; and (vi) development of the district&#13;
performance evaluation and incentive system, as well as the redesign of MOH's health&#13;
survey (SKRT) and collection of baseline data.&#13;
D. MoNrroRING AND EVALUATION&#13;
3.41        Several indices of performance were agreed with GOI during negotiations.&#13;
Of these, intensive project monitoring and evaluation will focus on the following core&#13;
variables, which are key, proximate determinants of health outcomes:&#13;
(a)   Quality of care: This will be measured by the extent to which health&#13;
providers and patients comply with recommended standards of care or case&#13;
management protocols (See Annex 14 for examples). Health interventions&#13;
can be thought of as a series of steps involving history taking,- physical&#13;
examination, treatment, counseling and patient knowledge. Within each of&#13;
this step are activities which if carried out correctly would maximize the&#13;
probability of safe and effective care. An observation form, which has been&#13;
developed and tested for quality assessment, has several items (about 40 to&#13;
60) for each health intervention detailing the activities that should be&#13;
performed. The quality of care provided by a health staff will be measured&#13;
as the ratio of the number of recommended activities performed correctly&#13;
relative to the total items in the observation form. Quality measurement&#13;
would be applied to vaccinations, ARI, antenatal care, diarrhea and other&#13;
health interventions included in HP IV's BHS list (Annex 13). Initially, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
simple average of the various compliance rates for all of the HP IV basic&#13;
health services would be used as a summary indicator of the quality of care.&#13;
During the course of project implementation other aggregation schemes will&#13;
be tried and consumer satisfaction measures will be developed and factored&#13;
in. Quality of care indicators will be measured annually.&#13;
(b)   Rate of adoption of QA processes. This indicator is intended to monitor&#13;
the extent to which health center staff and their supervisors know and&#13;
practice key quality assurance principles and processes. These are likely to&#13;
include: clinical competency measures, number of staff trained in QA,&#13;
knowledge of the standards of care, applications of QA techniques,&#13;
problem-solving skills of staff, frequency of QA meetings, number of&#13;
process improvement teams. This indicator will be refined and tested during&#13;
the first year of the project. The key challenge here that needs to be&#13;
addressed is measuring the effectiveness with which health facilities are&#13;
applying these QA processes. An approach that will be explored by the&#13;
project will be the use of an expert review panel to rate the effectiveness of&#13;
the QA procedures and process being established in a small sample of health&#13;
facilities.&#13;
(c)   Basic health services utilization rate: This measure would consist of&#13;
contact rate and visit rate. Contact rate is defined as the number of persons&#13;
in contact with health facilities in the last month relative to the number of&#13;
people in the catchment area.   Contact rate will be obtained through&#13;
SUSENAS and, if necessary, a specially designed survey. Visit rate is&#13;
defined as the total number of visits made to health facilities in the previous&#13;
four weeks relative to the total number of people in the catchment area.&#13;
The BHS list contains at least ten classes of health interventions. Therefore,&#13;
there will also be at least ten different BHS related utilization measures.&#13;
Aggregating these into a single indicator is not straightforward, because&#13;
they differ in relative importance. The project will formulate a scoring&#13;
system for aggregating these various measures into a single indicator during&#13;
the first year of project implementation. For practical reasons, emphasis will&#13;
be put on visit rate, using data from the facilities monitoring system whose&#13;
improvement has already been started under the Third Health Project.&#13;
(d)   Share of Central, provincial, and district health subsidies going to basic&#13;
health services and the poor. The percentage share of the consolidated&#13;
Central, provincial, and district health subsidies would be monitored&#13;
annually. The share of these subsidies going to the poor would be measured&#13;
every other year, starting in the first year.&#13;
3.42         To monitor equity improvements, the quality and utilization indicators would&#13;
be measured separately for the poor and better-off, using income/expenditure poverty&#13;
thresholds based on GOI's current estimate. The MOH Bureau of Planning would develop&#13;
a socioeconomic classification of households and communities to identify the poor,&#13;
building on the government's IDT program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
3.43        During negotiations, indicative targets for the above core performance&#13;
indicators were agreed. Agreement was also reached as to the frequency with which they&#13;
would be monitored.&#13;
3.44        In addition, GOI gave assurances that it would: (i) not later than&#13;
March 31 in each year, starting March 31, 1997, furnish to the Bank evaluation reports,&#13;
covering approximately a two-year evaluation period, of the health districts'perfornance&#13;
in terms of agreed performance indicators; and (ii) thereafter, review with the Bank the&#13;
reports and take all measures required to ensure imnprovements in the health districts'&#13;
performance in terms of the agreed performance indicators, including, if necessary, the&#13;
reduction of Special Assistance Funds to non-perfonning health districts.&#13;
3.45        Supervision and technical audit. Like other projects in Indonesia, Bank&#13;
supervision (Annex 4) would be conducted twice a year. Midterm and final project&#13;
reviews would be undertaken, using local and international consultants as necessary.&#13;
Assurances were given by GOI during negotations that it would submit the reports of&#13;
the midterm review, acceptable to the Bank, not later than December 31, 1997, and&#13;
discuss with the Bank the results of the review not later than February 28, 1998.&#13;
3.46        Supervision requirements would not be excessive. Supervision would need&#13;
to focus on Kalbar and Sumbar, because East Java has many experienced local health&#13;
officials and NTB and Kaltim (Third Health provinces) will have fewer activities. The&#13;
project would also use simplified budgetary arrangements (the DIP Terpadu) and&#13;
redesigned systems of ordering and managing drugs and health equipment. HP III&#13;
introduced these innovations in NTB and Kaltim and found them to be reliable and&#13;
efficient.&#13;
3.47        Furthermore, the project by design has built-in mechanisms to ensure&#13;
development effectiveness. These include: (i) the establishment of a quality assurance&#13;
system, which would improve supervision effectiveness; (ii) the aforementioned&#13;
performance-linked incentive system, which would create incentives for district&#13;
management (particularly, the Dokabu) to effectively supervise and guide health centers&#13;
in the cost-effective use of their available resources; (iii) greater attention by the MOH&#13;
Inspectorate-General to the technical audit of HP IV implementation; (iv) the&#13;
implementation schedule has been worked out in a way that before coverage of activities&#13;
is expanded significantly, most of the above arrangements would have already been put in&#13;
place; and (v) a team of local and international experts who would annually review (audit)&#13;
HP IV implementation and recommend corrective actions. GOI has agreed that this&#13;
technical audit would be funded by the project and that the selection of the external&#13;
auditors would be subject to Bank's agreement.&#13;
3.48        Bank supervision would include an annual meeting with all of the provincial&#13;
delegations at once to review expenditures, policy reform and work programs. To&#13;
facilitate this review and ensure adequate involvement of the provinces, agreement has&#13;
been reached with GOI during negotiations that a joint consultative meeting among the&#13;
Bank and the central and provincial teams be held annually to provide a venue whereby&#13;
key achievements by the provinces would be recognized, lessons learned would be shared,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
and suggestions for corrective and other future actions discussed. The terms of reference&#13;
for this meeting was agreed during negotiations.&#13;
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
3.49         Provision for technical assistance (Annex 1) is crucial for the success of HP&#13;
IV. It is needed to develop and institutionalize the various innovations to be introduced&#13;
by the project. Hence, local and international consultants would be hired to assist both&#13;
Central and local implementation units.&#13;
3.50         The cost of this technical assistance (TA) is moderate at about US$8.5&#13;
million equivalent or less, which is about 6 percent of total project cost. Expenditures for&#13;
consultants are estimated to be less than 10 percent of Bank loan.  International&#13;
consultants, which were limited to what is critically needed, would be contracted for about&#13;
148 person months (about a quarter of total consultancy). They would be deployed mostly&#13;
during the first half of the project period and would be geared towards creating local&#13;
capacity by teaming them up with domestic consultants and dedicated key MOH staff.&#13;
3.51         In general, consultants, both local and international, would help MOH to:&#13;
(i) formulate suitable standards of care (BHS case management protocols) and establish&#13;
quality assurance programs based on international and Indonesian experience; (ii) develop&#13;
the capacity of Pusdiklat and Bapelkes to provide supporting QA training programs and&#13;
instructional materials based on distance learning and on-the-job training approaches; (iii)&#13;
redesign and test performance assessment and staff incentives systems; (iv) develop and&#13;
test capitation-based prepaid health benefit plans using private providers of care; (v) reform&#13;
the drugs and equipment inventory and management systems; and (vi) design an&#13;
appropriate framework for pricing health services of government facilities and targeting&#13;
health subsidies to BHS and the poor.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER 4&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. COSTS&#13;
4.1          The total cost of the project is estimated at US$134.3 million equivalent&#13;
(Rp 294.4 billion), including contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Tables 4.1 and&#13;
4.2 summarize the estimated costs by province and by project component and category of&#13;
expenditure, respectively. Detailed project costs by year, purpose and components are given&#13;
in Annex 6.&#13;
4.2          Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at March 1995 prices.&#13;
Civil works costs are based on average square meter construction costs in the project provinces&#13;
for government buildings. The cost of land is not included in the above costs. Furniture costs&#13;
are based on lists of standard locally available items. Medical and office equipment, and&#13;
vehicle costs are based on current prices for similar imported or locally available items. Costs&#13;
for international and domestic consultants are in line with recent health projects for&#13;
appropriately qualified experts. Unit cost for domestic fellowships is about US$5,000 per staff-&#13;
year for long-term programs, and US$500 to US$1,000 per month for short-term programs.&#13;
Overseas training and fellowships range from US$5,000 per staff-month for short-term training&#13;
to US$25,000 per staff-year for long term programs. Operational costs are consistent with&#13;
current government practices and recent health projects.  Costs for short-term, in-country&#13;
training costs vary widely depending on the type of training being given and its location, and&#13;
average between US$25-45 per training day. Amounts for special assistance and program&#13;
development expenditures, and project management costs have been agreed between the Bank&#13;
and the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Health. Drug costs are based on INPRES price&#13;
schedules. Recurrent costs are based on standard government allowances for travel, per diem,&#13;
O&amp;M, and consumable materials.&#13;
4.3          Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies (US$5.7 million) represent&#13;
5 percent and price contingencies (US$13.8 million) 12 percent of baseline costs. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 5 percent have been allowed for all categories, as actual expenditures for all&#13;
project components are expected to differ from current estimates, given HP IV's programmatic&#13;
approach. Price contingencies have been calculated at 5.0 percent per year for local costs and&#13;
2.2 percent per year for foreign costs.&#13;
4.4          Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$40.4&#13;
million (representing about 30 percent of total project costs) based on the following percentages:&#13;
(a) overseas fellowships and vehicles - 90 percent, (b) equipment and international consultants -&#13;
80 percent, (c) drugs included in recurrent costs - 50 percent, (d) civil works and furniture -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
30 percent; and (d) domestic consultants, domestic studies, program development expenditure,&#13;
special assistance expenditures, project management costs and incremental recurrent costs -&#13;
10 percent.&#13;
4.5               Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$3.0 million&#13;
(Rp. 6.6 billion) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all goods and materials,&#13;
and it would be financed 100% by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;

B. FiNANCING&#13;
4.6            The total project cost of US$134.3 million equivalent would be financed by a&#13;
proposed loan of USUS$88.0 million equivalent, covering 67 percent of total project costs&#13;
excluding taxes (96 percent of foreign and 53 percent of local expenditures). The Government&#13;
would finance from its annual budget the remaining costs of US$46.3 million equivalent (33&#13;
percent of the total project costs excluding taxes or 34 percent of total project costs including&#13;
taxes).&#13;
4.7            Incremental Recurrent Costs. Incremental recurrent costs are additional costs&#13;
associated with the MOH and its PlUs. These account for 24 percent of total base costs. All&#13;
special assistance expenditures and project-related incremental recurrent costs would be financed&#13;
on a declining basis in order to ensure sustainability.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.8            The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of goods and services&#13;
under all project components:&#13;
(a)    Civil works totalling  about US$31.4 million equivalent.   Because of the&#13;
geographical dispersion of project sites and the small size of most contracts,&#13;
contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for civil works&#13;
valued at less than US$50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$5.0&#13;
million may be awarded through national shopping, or where no experienced&#13;
contractors are available may be carried out by force account, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$2.0 million.&#13;
(b)    Equipment and furniture totalling about US$15.3 million equivalent including&#13;
contingencies. All equipment and furniture will be handled by central, provincial&#13;
and district levels depending on where the goods are being delivered. Specific&#13;
hospital equipment contract packages valued at or above US$200,000 would be&#13;

than US$50,000 or equipment of a specialized nature for which NCB is not&#13;
practical, up to an aggregate limit of US$7.9 million including taxes, may be&#13;
purchased through international and national shopping on the basis of three price&#13;
quotations.&#13;
(c)    Vehicle costs totalling about US$0.1 million equivalent. The Government of&#13;
Indonesia considers the procurement of vehicles as reserve procurement and&#13;
therefore Bank financing would not be used to purchase vehicles. During&#13;
negoiations, the Government gave assurances th  it would provide the&#13;
required vehicles for the project in accordance with a schedule agreed with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(d)   Consultant services and studies totalling  about US$8.5 million equivalent,&#13;
would be selected and contracted in accordance with Bank Guidelines.&#13;

Placement of candidates in foreign and domestic institutions would be made on&#13;
the basis of the relevance and quality of the programs offered, costs, and prior&#13;
experience, according to government administrative procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Training contracts totalling about US$3.8 million equivalent would be&#13;
awarded to local providers in accordance with Government administrative&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(f)    Project management totalling about US$5.2 million equivalent.  Project&#13;
management expenses, including travel allowances, office costs, and other&#13;
operational costs, meetings, and administrative support, would be spent following&#13;
government administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(g)   Incremental recurrent costs totalling about US$60.4 million equivalent.&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs including supervision travel expenses, operations and&#13;
maintenance, office consumables and eligible expenditures under the SAF&#13;
operating guidelines, would be spent following government administrative&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.9         Procurement Review. Review by the Bank would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   By loan effectiveness, the Bank will carry out a prior review of (i) standard&#13;
bidding documents for civil works and goods contracts to be awarded under ICB&#13;
and NCB procedures, and (ii) letters of invitation for consultant services, to&#13;
ascertain their conformity with the Bank guidelines. The approved documents&#13;
would be used as master documents for all future bidding;&#13;
(b)   All civil works contracts valued at or over US$1,000,000, if any, and goods&#13;
contracts valued at or over US$200,000 would be subject to prior review by the&#13;
Bank, whereas all other contracts for civil works and goods would be subject to&#13;
random  post-review.  However, the first contract for civil works in each&#13;
province and the first contract for goods in each province estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of $50,000 or more will be subject to prior review. Roughly 20% of&#13;
civil works contracts, and 25% of goods contracts are likely to be covered by&#13;
prior review. The largely successful province-level procurement experience in&#13;
the HP III Project suggests that these prior review percentages are sufficient. In&#13;
addition, standard bidding documents will be used for both ICB and NCB&#13;
procedures, and regular random post review would be carried out by the resident&#13;
mission and supervision missions;&#13;
(c)   Consultant contracts valued at or over US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individual would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other consultant&#13;
contracts would be subject to random post review. However, all consultants'&#13;
terms of reference would be subject to prior review;&#13;
(d)   Fellowships would be subject to random post-review by the Bank; and&#13;
(e)   Annual training plans for each year would be included in the annual report for&#13;
discussion with the Bank.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.10        The proposed loan of US$88.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a&#13;
period of about 5 years (Annex 8). The project is expected to be completed by September 30,&#13;
2000, and the Loan would be closed six months later on March 31, 2001. The disbursement&#13;
schedule is based on the implementation schedule and the disbursement profile for health project&#13;
in Indonesia. It is somewhat faster to reflect the establishment of the special account and the&#13;
timely implementation experience of HP IV Project team. Disbursements estimated for the first&#13;
semester of FY96 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the project Special Account.&#13;
Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;
(a) civil works                    US$20,300,000   91 % of total expenditures&#13;
(non-INPRES financed)&#13;

4.11        Disbursements from the Loan for the following contracts would be made against&#13;
full documentation: (a) civil works contracts valued at or more than US$1,000,000; (b) goods&#13;
contracts valued at or more than US$200,000; and (c) consultant services contracts with&#13;
individual consultants valued at or more than US$50,000 and consulting firm contracts valued&#13;
at or more than US$100,000. All other disbursements would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible agencies&#13;
and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions.  To facilitate&#13;
disbursements, a Special Account in an amount of US$4.0 million would be established at Bank&#13;
Indonesia. This Special Account would be held in the name of Directorate General of Budget,&#13;
Ministry of Finance, following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for&#13;
all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment to the Special Account would be&#13;
made on a monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever&#13;
occurs first.&#13;
E. ACCOuNTS, AuDrrs AND REPORTS&#13;
4.12        MOH would establish project accounts for all project expenditures at both the&#13;
provincial and central levels, to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices.&#13;
Accounts for the SOEs and Special Account would be maintained separately for annual audits.&#13;
Each provincial PIU would send financial statements for all project expenditures for each fiscal&#13;
year to the Project Secretariat. The Project Secretariat would consolidate the five provincial&#13;
financial statements with the central level financial statement and prepare a consolidated&#13;
financial report. The financial statements and consolidated financial reports would be audited&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, including a separate audit opinion on SOE&#13;
expenditures. Certified copies of the financial report on the project for each Government fiscal&#13;
year, together with the auditors' statements, would be furnished to the Bank as soon as&#13;
available, but not later than six months after the end of each government fiscal year starting&#13;
June 30, 1996. MOH would also monitor progress in project implementation and report to the&#13;
Bank each semester on this progress. Within six months after the completion of disbursement,&#13;
the Ministry would submit an implementation completion report (ICR) to the Bank.&#13;
4.13        Technical Audits. MOH has the primary responsibility to monitor all project&#13;
activities and routine monitoring would be added through annual reviews. However, given a&#13;
large number of contracts that will be financed under SOE procedures implemented by each&#13;
project management level, an independent, qualified firm with external technical assistance&#13;
would be hired to conduct technical audits of key project activities.  These include&#13;
implementation of QA, SAF, PDE, health finance and management reforms, and training&#13;
programs. The above audits would cover activities in progress and post review of completed&#13;
actions to examine whether from the substantive, technical standpoint implementation of the&#13;
various project components are appropriate and to recommend corrective measures, if&#13;
necessary. These audits would be conducted annually on a random sample basis. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would cause technical audits to be&#13;
carried out, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, by April I in each year during the&#13;
irnplementation of the project and furnish a copy of such audit to the Bank for comments,&#13;
by July 31 of each such year.&#13;

CHAPTER 5&#13;
BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFTS&#13;
5.1         By empowering provincial, district and facility authorities and thereby&#13;
improving the delivery and quality of basic health services, the project would increase the&#13;
number of people utilizing them and benefitting from their use. Consequently, mortality&#13;
and suffering from pain and disability due to illness could be reduced significantly. The&#13;
poor particularly would gain from the project, as one of the worst aspects of&#13;
poverty-premature death, disability and debility from illness-would be considerably&#13;
alleviated by the project's emphasis on the extension of cost-effective packages of good&#13;
quality basic health services to the poor.&#13;
5.2          The expected health service improvements would benefit a wide range of&#13;
potential clients. The major beneficiaries, however, are expected to be women and&#13;
children from both poor and well-off families. At present, maternal, infant and childhood&#13;
diseases are major causes of mortality and morbidity. It is precisely these diseases that&#13;
most of the health interventions supported by the project are directed against (e.g.,&#13;
immunization, ante-natal care, treatment of diarrhoea, health education, de-worming and&#13;
provision of selected micronutrients).&#13;
5.3         The total population that could benefit from the project is estimated to be&#13;
about 27 million. This is the number of persons covered by the 886 health centers&#13;
included in HP IV. Of the 27 million potential beneficiaries, about 20 percent are poor&#13;
and another 13 percent are near-poor. In the long-term, the benefits from HP IV would&#13;
likely go well beyond these districts. As the project proves to be successful, its initiatives&#13;
would most likely be adopted by other provinces. The experience of Third Health in this&#13;
respect is very encouraging. Innovations that moved successfully under that project then&#13;
became part of GOI's national policy.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.4         Health Finance. A major step towards increasing resources for BHS and&#13;
reorienting government health spending towards the poor is to raise the prices of health&#13;
services provided by public facilities, while protecting the poor from their impact. The&#13;
problem is that it is difficult to predict the pace and extent of price reforms that could be&#13;
accomplished under HP IV. Raising prices of government health services is politically&#13;
sensitive and some local governments, which are responsible for the prices of publicly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
managed health services, may be reluctant to make substantial price increases. Therefore,&#13;
increasing cost-recovery rates to appropriate levels might be delayed or could become&#13;
impossible in some districts.&#13;
5.5          Despite this risk, the chances that targeted cost-recovery rates will be&#13;
increased significantly as a result of the project remain good, primarily because of GOI's&#13;
strong commitment. Both the Ministry of Health and BAPPENAS have been involved in&#13;
formulating this policy and has actively campaigned for the support of provincial and&#13;
district officials from the outset of project preparation. The results of this effort, which&#13;
reinforced provincial and district support for price reform, are reassuring. For example,&#13;
the Bupati of the starter districts have already submitted to the Bank signed decrees&#13;
addressed to local staff supporting price adjustments. Another encouraging factor is that&#13;
the Third Health experience showing the feasibility and beneficial effects of price increases&#13;
has proven to be an effective material for promoting price reforms. This experience&#13;
together with the recent introduction of health cards exempting the poor from paying fees&#13;
for government health services provides HP IV an effective tool for assuaging concerns&#13;
about the impact of fee increases.  Finally, sufficient funds have been allocated in&#13;
provincial and central government expenditure programs to support activities promoting&#13;
cost recovery and appropriate targeting of health subsidies.&#13;
5.6          Training. There is a large but manageable training challenge involved in&#13;
transferring skills and information needed for a QA program. As currently practiced,&#13;
training has several features that are counter-productive. Absences of staff from work due&#13;
to training overload are becoming a problem. Staff have a perverse incentive to participate&#13;
in unnecessary training to augment their incomes through training-related honoraria and&#13;
per diems. Promotion credits are also awarded on the basis of simple attendance. The&#13;
actual acquisition of competencies is rarely measured and recorded.&#13;
5.7          The risk that off-the-job training activities could become excessive,&#13;
disrupting the provision of services in the health centers, was highlighted during appraisal&#13;
and was well-appreciated by concerned GOI officials. Consequently, GOI intends to use&#13;
the project to develop and assess alternatives to off-the-job training such as distance&#13;
learning and other on-the-job training approaches. The project will also test direct, skill-&#13;
based incentives that have proved feasible in other settings. The credit points system for&#13;
promotion, which rewards mere attendance in training events, would also be reviewed and&#13;
revised to take into account actual competencies learned. Furthernore, assurances were&#13;
provided during negotiations by GOI that it would: (a) not later than January 31, 1996,&#13;
furnish to the Bank a proposal for a scheduling and management mechanism for the&#13;
training of staff which minimizes disruption in the facilities' activities and which&#13;
ensures: (i) that training courses under the project address documented skills deficits&#13;
critical to BHS improvement and have defined and measurable outcomes; and (ii) that&#13;
training courses are evaluated on the basis of the trainees' measurable acquisition of&#13;
relevant gains in skills and knowledge; and (b) before implementing the training, have&#13;
the relevant course materials available for the trainees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
C. SUSrAINABxLrrY&#13;
5.8          Prospects for project sustainability are very good. Indonesia's outlook for&#13;
economic growth is bright, and the cost of the project's various initiatives is modest and&#13;
affordable. Moreover, there is a strong sense of project ownership and a firm commitment&#13;
by participating provincial governments and GOI to carry on successful HP IV initiatives&#13;
with local funds and retained earnings of health facilities. Furthermore, as the project&#13;
eases current concerns about the public health sector's inability to efficiently absorb&#13;
additional funds, resistance to budgetary increases for basic health services could be&#13;
reduced considerably. Finally, through its promotion of higher cost recovery, greater&#13;
retention of revenues earned by public health facilities, as well as intensified mobilization&#13;
of private resources (e.g., health insurance), the project is expected to facilitate budgetary&#13;
reallocations that would increase health subsidies to basic health services and poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;
D. ENVIRoNMENTAL IMACT&#13;
5.9          The project does not pose any significant environmental threat.  The&#13;
possibility of hospital wastes impacting on the environment is unlikely to be significant,&#13;
since there will be no major hospital construction under HP IV. On the contrary, HP IV&#13;
could contribute to the quality of the environment to the extent that the project strengthens&#13;
the ability of health centers to deal with communicable diseases and pathogens in the&#13;
environment.&#13;

CORE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND&#13;
INDICATIVE TARGETS FOR&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
This note describes indicative targets for the following core performance indicators. These&#13;
indicators are part of a broader list of performance indicators (agreed with GOI) for the project.&#13;
As with the other performance indicators these will be collected annually by the district health&#13;
offices and compiled at the provincial level.&#13;
QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
The Fourth Health Project will seek to raise the rate of compliance to standards of care or&#13;
operating procedures (SOP) to at least 80%. This means that if in the SOP there are 30&#13;
different kinds of activities to be carried out, 24 of them will be correctly implemented.&#13;
2.    RATE OF ADOPTION&#13;
The project would measure the rate of adoption of QA mechanisms. The number of&#13;
interventions in the basic health package for which QA would be established over the&#13;
project period is as follows:&#13;

3.    BASIC HEALTH SERVICES UTILIZATION RATE&#13;
Utilization rate will be broken down into contact rate and visit rate. Contact rate is defined&#13;
as the number of individuals who had contact with govermnent health facilities in the last&#13;
month divided by the number of people in their catchment area. Visit rate is defined as the&#13;
total number of visits made to government health facilities in the previous month divided by&#13;
the total number of people in their catchment area. For practical reasons, emphasis during&#13;
this project will be put on visit rate. Data from the health facilities' monitoring system,&#13;
whose improvement has been already started by the Third Health Project, will be used to&#13;
estimate visit rate. Contact rate can be obtained through SUSENAS or a specially designed&#13;
survey, if deemed necessary. The project will seek to increase the visit rate at a minimum&#13;
of 10% annually.&#13;
4.    SHARE OF CENTRAL, PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT HEALTH SUBSIDIES&#13;
GOING TO BASIC HEALTH SERVICES AND POOR&#13;
The percentage share of the consolidated central, provincial, and district health subsidies&#13;
going to BHS would be imonitored annually. The share of these subsidies going to the poor&#13;
would be measured every other year, starting in the first year. Indicative targets, which&#13;
will be reviewed annually and adjusted as needed, have also been set for BHS recurrent&#13;
expenditures per capita (see attached Fourth Health Project Financing Plan).&#13;

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:&#13;
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
Project Activities by Components&#13;
I. Facility-Level Service Improvement (65%): US$74.2 million equivalent&#13;
To ensure that frontline staff are able to deliver locally appropriate, highly cost-&#13;
effective BHS, funding would be provided for:&#13;
(a)   Health Facility Construction and Upgrading (32%): US$36.9 million&#13;
equivalent&#13;
This amount would support investment costs for upgrading, renovation and&#13;
building of health centers, subcenters, storage facilities (e.g., for drugs) and, to a&#13;
limited extent, district hospitals. It would also finance equipment, water supply,&#13;
vehicles and furniture needed to outfit these facilities.&#13;
(b)   Special Assistance Program for Basic Health Services (33%): US$37.3&#13;
million equivalent&#13;
This program would fund expenditures on equipment and furniture,&#13;
operational expenses and recurrent costs (on a declining rate) necessary to meet the&#13;
resource requirements of reducing current gaps in the quality and provision of basic&#13;
health services. These expenditures would include expenses for institutionalizing&#13;
QA practices, improving BHS utilization, strengthening outreach activities and&#13;
carrying out on-the-job training in QA/BHS problem-solving, management and&#13;
planning, laboratory, supervision, etc.&#13;
US$14.1 of these funds would be provided to health facilities through&#13;
discretionary Special Assistance Funds (SAF). These funds would be used for&#13;
financing eligible expenses listed in the SAF Operating Guidelines (Annex 10) and&#13;
classified as Special Assistance Expenditures (SAE) in the cost tables' category of&#13;
expenditures. Each eligible health center would initially be allocated an annual HC&#13;
SAF that ranges from Rp 6 million (East Java) to Rp. 10 million (West&#13;
Kalimantan).&#13;
II. Institutional Development (34%): US$39.2 million equivalent&#13;
This component would improve the capacity of Central, provincial and district level&#13;
agencies to assist, motivate, and supervise frontline health providers in delivering&#13;
accessible high quality packages of basic health services.  The following would be&#13;
supported:&#13;

(a) Support for Quality Assurance Mechanisms: US$7.5 million equivalent&#13;
HP IV would assist in building the capacity of the above agencies to&#13;
promote and help establish quality assurance practices in health facilities and units&#13;
in charge of their supervision. This component will fund workshops, materials,&#13;
consultant services, incentives, fellowships, travel and other expenses to carry out&#13;
the following activities: (i) review of current standards as applied to clinical&#13;
protocols, and management and support procedures; (ii) establishment of a formal&#13;
accreditation process in which health centers and their staff will receive some&#13;
incentives based on documented quality improvements; (iii) training of clinic staff&#13;
and field supervisors and enhancement of field support for the application of&#13;
modern quality assurance techniques; (iv) development of Central and provincial&#13;
staff dedicated to QA and professional organizations as sources of technical&#13;
assistance; and (v) documentation and dissemination of problem-solving experiences&#13;
through a professionally produced QA newsletter.&#13;
(b) Support for Training and Curriculum Development: US$9.1 million&#13;
equivalent&#13;
This component would develop institutional capacity at the district level and&#13;
above to provide training support required by the quality assurance program and&#13;
other key HP IV initiatives. The project will fund expenditures for instructional&#13;
materials and equipment, workshops, consultant services, fellowships, incentives&#13;
and other expenses needed for the following activities: (i) building a capacity in&#13;
Pusdiklat  and  Bapelkes  to  train  trainers  and  to  develop  learning&#13;
materials/methodologies needed by the QA program; (ii) assessment of clinical&#13;
training needs; (iii) development of QA learning packages and alternatives to&#13;
residence/off-the-job training courses such as distance learning; (iv) training,&#13;
evaluation and certification of trainers; (v) monitoring and evaluation of post-&#13;
training performance; (vi) revision of incentives to learning; and (vii) institution of&#13;
a training information system and approval process to control training activities&#13;
better.&#13;
(c) Support for Performance-Linked Incentives: US$0.6 million equivalent&#13;
Under this subcomponent, HP IV would finance activities designed to&#13;
establish a system for measuring and rewarding district performance. The project&#13;
would fund expenditures for consultants services, travel, materials, computers,&#13;
software, equipment, surveys, incentives and other expenses for: (i) formulating&#13;
system design and ways of measuring the performance criteria in Annex 3; (ii) data&#13;
collection and analysis; and (iii) provision of performance-based incentives.&#13;
(d) Replication and Piloting Innovative Initiatives: US$15.5 million equivalent&#13;
HP IV would support several efforts to replicate HP III innovations and try&#13;
other initiatives that could lead to improvements in the organizational culture of the&#13;
public health system and its role in the provision of basic health services. This&#13;
subcomponent would finance expenditures related to the following activities:&#13;

basic drugs and other materials.&#13;
(ii) Piloting Exemplary Integrated District Health System: US$13.7 million&#13;
equivalent&#13;
The project would also support a program providing health districts with&#13;
discretionary Special Assistance Funds (HD SAF). Dokabus can use these funds&#13;
as they deem appropriate to improve their supervision, support and motivation of&#13;
frontline managers and staff, provided their expenditures conform to the SAF&#13;
Operating Guidelines (see Annex 10). Eligible expenditures, referred to as Special&#13;
Assistance Expenditures in the cost tables below, include operational costs,&#13;
instructional materials and equipment, incentives, health providers' fees, and other&#13;
expenses for:   QA  development, strengthening of outreach activities and&#13;
supervision, building of the district's capacity to provide on-the-job training&#13;
support, staff re-deployment, and improved monitoring and evaluation. A total of&#13;
US$9.4 million will be allocated for the Health District SAF.&#13;
In addition, this subcomponent would fund a limited number of pilot&#13;
programs and QA studies. Under this component, the project would finance&#13;
program development expenditures (PDE) needed to carry out proposals approved&#13;

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:&#13;
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
SAF OPERATING GUIDELINES&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   HEP IV would finance expenditures needed to carry out service improvement plans drawn up by&#13;
health centers and districts through problem-solving and priority setting exercises. The aim is to enhance&#13;
the ability and motivation of frontline providers and managers to render higher quality, more accessible&#13;
basic health services (BHS) that efficiently meet the needs and demands of clients and that effectively reach&#13;
the poor. For this purpose, a program would be established providing Special Assistance Funds (SAFs) for&#13;
health centers (HC) and health districts (HD).&#13;
2.    SAFs comprise discretionary resources that puskesmas and health district managers could use for&#13;
eligible expenditures (mainly for operations) needed to initiate and implement their plans. This annex&#13;
summarizes the list of eligible expenditures, the operating procedures regarding the use of SAFs, and the&#13;
assionment of oversight responsibility. (Expenditures made through the SAF are referred to in the cost&#13;
tables and below as SAE or Special Assistance Expenditures.)&#13;
3.    HC and HD managers are expected to use SAFs as they deem appropriate within the parameters&#13;
described in these guidelines.&#13;
Eligible Expenditures and Criteria for Awarding SAFs&#13;
4.    The above funds could be spent only on goods and services described in the attached Tables I and&#13;
2 of this Annex.&#13;
Limitations&#13;
5.    Allocation to staff incentives should not exceed 25 percent of the HC special assistance fund.&#13;
Administration, Technical Review and Record Keeping&#13;
6.    The Dokabu is responsible for the administration of both HC and HD SAFs. Required documents&#13;
(see below) should be kept at one designated District Health Office location for spot-checking by Bank&#13;
supervision missions and for audit purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 4&#13;
Documentation Requirements&#13;
7.    The following documents should be submitted before SAFs are budgeted in the DIP:&#13;
(a)   Health center proposals signed by the Puskesmas head and countersigned by the Dokabu,&#13;
briefly indicating his comments,&#13;
(b)   Health district proposals signed by the Dokabu and countersigned by the Kakanwil along&#13;
with brief comments from him.&#13;
Financial Accountability Procedures&#13;
8.    Financial audit will be conducted according to standard government operating procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
9.    Special assistance expenditures (SAE), which are outlays paid for by SAFs, would be financed by&#13;
the Bank through standard SOE (Statement of Expenditures) procedures, on a declining rate basis. These&#13;
expenses would be financed by the Bank only if they follow the SAF operating guidelines.&#13;
Dokabu's Annual HC SAF Report&#13;
10.   The Dokabu will submit a report to the Kakanwil not later than September 1 of each year. It will&#13;
summarize the accomplishments of the recipient health centers, highlighting the health district's analysis of&#13;
five most important problems for which the SAFs were used, separately for HC and HD. The report also&#13;
should describe the solutions implemented, key lessons learned, and corrective steps taken or proposed to&#13;
improve efficient utilization and effectiveness of SAFs.&#13;

district or municipal health offices:&#13;
1. Health Centers&#13;
* Travel costs&#13;
* Maintenance of health center and sub-centers (maximum Rp. 5 million per year per health center&#13;

Table 2&#13;
Criteria for Awarding SAE Funds&#13;
1. Health Centers - SAF funds should not be awarded equally to all health centers in the district. The level&#13;
of funds should be based on the following:&#13;
*   Ability of the community to paY for health services. Those areas covering poor villages should be allocated&#13;
more funds. Percent of population in poor villages (desa miskin) or the number of people with health cards&#13;
might be used as ways to measure this.&#13;
*   Difficulty in covering service area. Those health centers in areas which cover a large geographic area and&#13;
have difficult transportation should be given higher allocations. This might be done by giving a high unit&#13;
cost for travel.&#13;
.   High volume of services provided and high coverage of key prorrams. Health centers and sub-centers with&#13;
a large number of visits might be given high allocations to reflect their higher need for materials, supplies,&#13;
staff incentives and so forth. This also promotes greater efficiency. Special health centers with beds, a&#13;
large number of sub-centers or providing extra services (referral laboratory, etc.) should also receive higher&#13;
allocations.&#13;
*   Management including performance and implementation of previous allocations. Special considerations&#13;
should be given to health centers with high performance levels or where there have been substantial&#13;
improvements from previous years.&#13;
2. Districts and Municipal Health Offices - The basic criteria involved in determining the funds for the district&#13;
l SAF involve the size of the service area, the number of health centers and the relative wealth of the district or&#13;
municipality. In addition, special considerations are needed for staff incentives and the employment of&#13;
contract workers.&#13;
^   The ability of the district or municipality to fund its own recurrent costs for the district health office.&#13;
.   The number of health centers to be supervised and the unit cost of travel to health centers&#13;
.   The number of district health staff involved in supervision and the amount of time they are expected to&#13;
travel.&#13;
.   The number of areas where special assignment incentives are needed.&#13;
The difficulty in attracting staff to the district health office&#13;
The justification for special contract workers, mainly involving the need for critical staff and the lack of&#13;
alternatives.&#13;
The total population served in the district or municipality.&#13;
The performance of district staff in managing health services.&#13;
&#13;

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:&#13;
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
I .    The management of the project is based on three principles. First, it should use the&#13;
existing structure of the Ministry of Health (MOH) whenever possible to facilitate project&#13;
implementation and to make its innovations sustainable. Second, management arrangements&#13;
should be clear and simple to prevent responsibilities and accountability from becoming&#13;
diffused. Third, special emphasis on strengthening district management of health services, with&#13;
effective technical support from the provincial and central levels, should continue.&#13;
Central Level Management&#13;
2.    Project Director - The Project Director will have ultimate responsibility for the&#13;
Project. This position will be held by the Secretary General of MOH. He will be responsible&#13;
for making decisions involving the overall direction of the Project, as well as relevant policy&#13;
issues.&#13;
3.    Project Officer - The Chief of the Bureau of Planning in the Secretariat General will&#13;
be in-charge of managing the Project and will be accountable for its technical and&#13;
administrative aspects.&#13;
4.    Deputy Project Officer - The Project Officer would be assisted by a Deputy Project&#13;
Officer who would oversee day-to-day technical and administrative activities of HP IV. In&#13;
addition, he would be responsible for ensuring coordination of HP IV activities with other&#13;
government initiatives and donor-assisted projects to prevent unnecessary duplication and to&#13;
promote exchange of experience. An echelon III official in the Bureau of Planning would be&#13;
appointed as Deputy Project Director and would be assigned on a part-time basis.&#13;
5.    Project Secretariat - HP IV would establish a unit with full-time staff responsible for&#13;
routine administrative matters, including submittting required reports to the Bank and support&#13;
for technical activities. An Executive Secretary would be responsible for the management of&#13;
the Project Secretariat at the center and for coordinating work with the Administrative&#13;
Officers in the five provinces. Administrative and Financial Officers as well as other full-time&#13;
staff would be recruited to work for the Project Secretariat.&#13;
6.    A Central Technical Task Force would be organized to review and guide key&#13;
technical and policy innovations which involve Directorates General outside the Secretariat&#13;
General. Since most of the planned project initiatives concern Basic Health Services, the&#13;
Director General of Community Health would lead this Technical Task Force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -                           Annex 12&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
7.    An Advisory Board, consisting of Echelon I officials from various departments and&#13;
agencies involved in the project, would also be set up to ensure support for policy reforms&#13;
that need intersectorial consultation. The Board would be led by the Deputy for Human&#13;
Resource Development in BAPPENAS and would serve not only HP IV but also other Bank-&#13;
assisted health projects.&#13;
8.    A Steering Committee, consisting of Echelon II officials of MOH units involved in&#13;
HP IV would be established and attached to the Project Officer. This committee would meet&#13;
regularly to advise the Project Officer about various technical and administrative issues.&#13;
Provincial Level Management&#13;
9.    Provincial Project Ofricer - The head of the Provincial Health Office (Kakanwil)&#13;
would be the Provincial Project Officer, which would be the provincial equivalent of the&#13;
Project Director. The Kakanwil would ultimately be accountable for all project-related&#13;
activities in the province; he would be responsible for solving problems that cannot be&#13;
resolved at lower levels.&#13;
10.   Provincial Project Implementation Officer - The head of the Provincial Health&#13;
Services (Dinas Kesehatan I) would be in-charge of the implementation of all province-level.&#13;
11.   Administrative Officer - The head of the Provincial Health Office Planning Division&#13;
would oversee the overall administration of the project in the province and would be&#13;
responsible to the Provincial Project Officer. This part-time assignment would be in addition&#13;
to his structural duties. His project responsibility includes reporting, planning, coordination,&#13;
monitoring and reporting of HP IV activities. The Administrative Officer would be assisted by&#13;
a small, full-time administrative staff.&#13;
12.   Provincial Steering Committee - This would be an intersectoral committee with&#13;
representatives from local departments and agencies involved in project planning and&#13;
implementation.&#13;
13.   Provincial Technical Task Force - This task force would be responsible for&#13;
monitoring and guiding all technical aspects of HP IV innovations. It would be led by the&#13;
Provincial Project Officer, with the Head of the Division of Health Services in the Provincial&#13;
Health Office (Kanwil) as the first secretary. HP IV consultants would work closely with this&#13;
task force.&#13;
District Level Management&#13;
14.   District Project Officer - The head of the District Health Office (Dokabu) would be&#13;
responsible for the planning, implementation and administration of district-level project&#13;
activities. He would also oversee HP IV health center activities. The Dokabu would also be&#13;

in charge of proposing, testing and evaluating district health innovations. As District Project&#13;
Officer, he would report directly to the Provincial Project Officer (Kakanwil).&#13;
15.   District Health Development Committee - This body would be established to guide&#13;
the overall development of the health sector in the district. This would be an intersectoral&#13;
team with strong participation from the Bupati (Head of District Administration) and the head&#13;
of the district planning agency (BAPPEDA II).&#13;
16.   District Implementation Officer - He would be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
implementation of project activities within the district and would report to the District Project&#13;
Officer.&#13;
Health Center Level&#13;
17.   The Puskesmas head would be responsible for project activities at the health center,&#13;
and associated sub-centers and community. He would be accountable to the District Project&#13;
Officer (Dokabu).&#13;
18.   During the course of project implementation, efforts would be made to develop&#13;
mechanisms to promote active community involvement in health services, with the objective&#13;
of making health facilities more accountable to the community they are serving. To this end,&#13;
participation by local government and community organizations would be mobilized,&#13;
particularly the LKMD and village and sub-district leaders. Where appropriate, Community&#13;
Health Committees would be formed.&#13;

FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:&#13;
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
Basic Health Services&#13;
I.    A key mechanism through which BP IV would attain its goals of equity and quality&#13;
improvement is to reorient public spending on health towards basic health services (BHS). To&#13;
this end, GOI would raise the share of BHS in total health subsidies according to agreed&#13;
targets, the achievement of which would be reviewed regularly. The issue is what should&#13;
comprise BHS. This is important not only for setting those targets and monitoring their&#13;
achievement (a key result area), but also for defining the interventions for which the Special&#13;
Assistance Funds should be used.&#13;
2.    BHS and the DIP Terpadu. At present, GOI regards the primary health services&#13;
included in the DIP Terpadu as its BHS. Adjustments, however, are needed to sharpen the&#13;
focus of government health spending on highly cost-effective interventions, including some&#13;
basic referral services provided by district hospitals. In this regard, MOH plans to formulate a&#13;
BHS list based on both epidemiological and cost-effectiveness principles. The new&#13;
formulation would draw from the experience of the 1993 World Development Report,&#13;
particularly in regard its concept of essential health services and the DALY (disability-adjusted&#13;
life years) methodology. HP IV would support this initiative, which would be started soon&#13;
after project effectiveness.&#13;
3.    Completion of the above effort, however, would take time. It was agreed, therefore,&#13;
that the BHS would meanwhile comprise activities funded.in the current DIP Terpadu for&#13;
purposes of implementing and monitoring HP IV's agenda of raising BHS funding. These&#13;
essentially are activities conducted through the Puskesmas, including all outreach activities.&#13;
4.    The Basic Awal. In allocating limited HP IV funds, MOH would give top priority to&#13;
a subset of health services covered by the DIP Terpadu. The ten health services in this subset,&#13;
which are listed below and are referred to as Basic Awal, were chosen because they are&#13;
currently regarded as national priorities. Specifically, they were selected on the following&#13;
grounds:&#13;
(a)   their contribution to the IMR and MNR reduction;&#13;
(b)   GOI's international commitments of GOI (e.g., World Summit for Children&#13;
along with its Mid-Decade Goal; Polio Eradication by the Year 2000;&#13;
Elimination of Leprosy by the year 2000); and&#13;
(c)   Inclusion of other communicable diseases with high morbidity and mortality&#13;
rates, but low program coverage such as malaria in provinces outside Java-Bali&#13;
and tuberculosis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                             Annex 13&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
5.    The ten basic health services in the Basic Awal, for which MOH would like to provide&#13;
the funds needed to close existing gaps in utilization and quality, include:&#13;
(i)   immunization;&#13;
(ii)   antenatal care, including TT vaccination, provision of iron tablet and&#13;
referral of high risk pregnancy;&#13;
(iii)   treatment for TB cases;&#13;
(iv)    treatment for malaria cases;&#13;
(v)    treatment for ARl/pneumonia and diarrhea among under fives;&#13;
(vi)   iodine, vitamin A and iron tablets for pregnant women and under fives;&#13;
(vii)    vector control (especially, malaria and dengue);&#13;
(viii)    health education;&#13;
(ix)    family planning services; and&#13;
(x)    school health, including antihelmintics.&#13;
6.    Improvement in these services through direct and indirect means would be the initial&#13;
focus of HP IV financial support. During the course of HP-IV implementation, modifications&#13;
(acceptable to the Bank) of the composition of the Basic Awal would be made as the results&#13;
of the aforementioned cost-analysis become available.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
FOURTH HEALTH PROJECT:&#13;
IMPROVING EQUITY AND QUALITY OF CARE&#13;
Developing a Quality Assurance Program&#13;
1.    To improve the quality of basic health services provided by publicly managed health&#13;
facilities in Indonesia, it is necessary to change work processes, attitudes, skills and other&#13;
aspects of their organizational culture. A key to bring about this change is to establish facility-&#13;
level quality assurance (QA) processes. This annex briefly outlines HP IV's strategy for&#13;
developing and instituting QA mechanisms and practices and then presents initial results of a&#13;
QA pilot conducted by MOH as part of project preparation.&#13;
Quality Assurance Strategy&#13;
2.    Quality assurance is an approach to building institutional capacity and organizational&#13;
culture that focus on continuous improvements in service (product) quality and on its ability&#13;
to satisfy consumer requirements. In HP IV, this approach would be applied to problems&#13;
relating to compliance with case management protocols for effective care and broader issues&#13;
regarding efficient provision and utilization of services.&#13;
3.    The HP IV quality assurance program would seek to improve technical competence,&#13;
client satisfaction, efficiency, coverage/access, and effectiveness. The program would be an&#13;
evolutionary one, beginning with frontline health staff learning to analyze and resolve simple&#13;
problems of non-compliance with clinical standards and progressing to more complex issues&#13;
pertaining to priority-setting and health outcome problems. Its specific configuration would be&#13;
shaped through a series of structured learning-by-doing activities. Improving technical&#13;
compliance is good place to start: standards of care recommended on the basis of available&#13;
scientific information, if followed, provides the best chance to the patient of a speedy and safe&#13;
recovery.&#13;
4.    In broad outline, the establishment of QA mechanisms and practices in health facilities&#13;
would be phased as follows:&#13;
(a)    Phase 1. A detailed methodical analysis - referred to as "systems analysis" in the&#13;
QA literature -of the technical quality of health services would be conducted in&#13;
each participating health center. Observation guides, based on accepted treatment&#13;
norms, would be used to document where patient care fell short of the standard.&#13;
Based on the results of this analysis, each health center would develop its own plan&#13;
of action to correct lapses in technical quality and would implement those plans&#13;
through direct supervision and on-the-job training. The objective in this phase is to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
90 -                            Page 2 of 9&#13;
bring the provision of clinical services into compliance with recommended&#13;
standards of care. For example, if one of the standards for ARI (acute respiratory&#13;
infection) were to count the respiration rate, during phase 1 health centers would&#13;
ensure that all service delivery personnel would be able to perform this correctly&#13;
and do it for all ARI cases.&#13;
(b)    Phase 2. Supervisors would assist health centers in monitoring and improving&#13;
technical service quality. The supervisors would be trained to support and monitor&#13;
the improvements in activities and processes; they would also receive training in&#13;
how to analyze more complex quality problems (the difference between simple and&#13;
complex quality problems is described below). The objective of this phase is to&#13;
complete the work on compliance with technical standards of quality, and to move&#13;
on to somewhat more complex quality issues.&#13;
(c)    Phase 3. In the final phase of implementation, health center staff would be trained&#13;
to analyze and resolve complex service quality problems. While they would still be&#13;
assisted by the supervisors, the importance of the supervisor as a coach or&#13;
facilitator would diminish during this phase as health center staff acquire the skills&#13;
needed to analyze and solve complex problems. The objective of this phase is to&#13;
consolidate a sustained and effective effort at the health center level to improve&#13;
service quality.&#13;
Coverage&#13;
5.    The program would cover as many clinical activities as possible from the start of the loan&#13;
and technical performance standards will be adopted and disseminated for the following seven&#13;
health services: immunization, ante natal care (ANC), tuberculosis, malaria, ARI, nutrition, and&#13;
family pianning. Two districts in each province (three in East Java) would implement the QA&#13;
program during the first year of the loan; additional districts would be added each year until all of&#13;
the districts (included in HP IV) in a province have been incorporated into the program by the end&#13;
of year four.&#13;
The Experience of the Pilot Project&#13;
6.    To build a strong foundation for HP IV's quality assurance program, a pilot project&#13;
funded by resources from the Japan Grant Facility and USAID's International Quality&#13;
Assurance Program was undertaken to try out some QA models in ten health centers. The&#13;
aim was primarily to assist MOH develop its own QA program for HP IV funding. A&#13;
secondary objective was to get a head start in building MOH capacity to carry out its QA&#13;
program by providing key staff and domestic consultants some QA experience and by&#13;
documenting local case materials for QA training and promotion purposes.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 14&#13;

7.    The following discussion of the above-mentioned QA pilot activity illustrates how the&#13;
QA program will work in the field and lend substance to the concept of quality assurance.&#13;
(a)    The systems analysis: Ten health centers participated in the pilot project, five&#13;
in East Java and five in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). A baseline survey, or&#13;
systems analysis, of the quality of care in three basic health services -&#13;
antenatal care (ANC), management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), and&#13;
vaccination -was conducted in May and June of 1994. Three health workers&#13;
from each health center were trained in the use of observation forms that were&#13;
based on detailed service standards (these were adapted from international&#13;
sources through field testing in both provinces). An observation form&#13;
contained from 40 to 60 items for each health intervention detailing the&#13;
activities that should be performed. As an example, the section on ANC&#13;
history taking was checked to see if the health worker asked the expectant&#13;
woman six questions about her reproductive history (number of pregnancies,&#13;
previous complications, etc.) and ten questions on maternal risk factors&#13;
(spotting, kidney problems, use of medications, etc.). The three trained health&#13;
workers then spent two or more days in a neighboring clinic observing the&#13;
treatment given twenty-five patients for each of the three health interventions.&#13;
The assumption was that this number would provide an adequate sample to&#13;
identify deficiencies in health care. The large number of deficiencies reported in&#13;
this peer evaluation encourages confidence in the results.&#13;
(b)    Plans of action: The results of the systems analyses were given to the senior&#13;
staff of the health centers. The staffs were then asked to prepare plans of action&#13;
to address the deviations from standards. Consequently, they tried to identify&#13;
the most pressing quality problems and then sought to resolve them. In general,&#13;
they found they could address nearly all of the problems uncovered by the&#13;
systems analysis and correct those by themselves without additional resources.&#13;
(c)    Supervisory support: District supervisors were trained in the use of&#13;
checklists based on the standards. It was assumed that the supervisors would&#13;
perform two functions: they would communicate standards and they would&#13;
monitor supervision of standards in the health centers. In several of the health&#13;
centers they were permitted to perform only the first function, that of&#13;
communicating standards. Apparently, direct supervision of staff is often a&#13;
prerogative, jealously guarded, of the health center director. The supervisors,&#13;
almost none of them physicians and typically of less tenure than the clinic&#13;
directors, encountered subtle and overt resistance to their efforts to monitor&#13;
health worker performance. They were able to supervise long enough to&#13;
provide a model for direct observation of care, but once that model was&#13;
understood by the health center staff, the supervisor was displaced in that role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
- 92 -                            Page 4 of 9&#13;
(d)    Clinic-level activities: Within all of the health centers, a similar set of&#13;
activities evolved to improve quality. The clinic director, a doctor, discussed&#13;
the plan of action with clinic staff and a QA team was usually formed. Some of&#13;
these teams functioned as true quality improving teams; in other instances their&#13;
role was limited. The director then conducted informal training on the&#13;
standards. This training was followed up by monitoring of the health workers,&#13;
usually with the same checklists used by the supervisors. In most instances the&#13;
health workers were also provided with new job aids to provide visual re-&#13;
minders of the standards. In some instances these job aids were simple&#13;
reproductions of the supervisory checklists, in others the director developed&#13;
new aids that focused on specific deficiencies and in one instance the director&#13;
created innovative flow diagrams that guided the health worker through&#13;
history-taking, examination, classification, and treatment. In several clinics&#13;
there were initial problems of resistance from one or more health workers.&#13;
This resistance was overcome through persistent monitoring and direct&#13;
supervision. All of the clinics were visited periodically by the researchers. A&#13;
"circuit rider" visited each clinic approximately every ten days. An&#13;
international research consultant visited each of the NTB clinics two or more&#13;
times at the start of the pilot. And two national researchers made additional&#13;
periodic visits to the clinics. During the three-month experimental period&#13;
(August - October) each clinic received a dozen or more of these drop-in visits.&#13;
The frequency of these visits, necessary to monitor processes within the&#13;
clinics, almost certainly affected staff behavior.&#13;
Results&#13;
8.    Even the most optimistic expectations were surpassed by the results of the pilot&#13;
project (see Table 1/Annex 14). A second survey of clinical service quality was conducted in&#13;
November 1994. The sample sizes were reduced to 12 observations for each service in a&#13;
clinic; this is the minimum sample size consistent with LQAS (lot quality assurance sampling)&#13;
methodology. In most areas compliance with standards reached or approached 100 percent.&#13;
In all areas there was a marked improvement.&#13;
9.    There was concern that the clinic staffs might not undertake quality improvements&#13;
beyond simple adherence to standards. This concern was partly allayed by the findings. In&#13;
four of the ten clinics the staff tackled complex problems and all of the clinics took halting&#13;
steps toward addressing client satisfaction issues. The following cases are relevant examples:&#13;
* Chloroquine resistant (p. falciparum) malaria is a growing problem in some&#13;
areas of NTB. Prior to the pilot project, a clinic in an endemic area had treated&#13;
nearly all malaria patients based on clinical signs since the patients were&#13;
unwilling to wait 90 minutes for the blood analysis to be completed;&#13;
consequently nearly all patients were treated with chloroquine.  This was&#13;
obviously an unsatisfactory situation and the clinic staff initiated a program of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;
93                             Page 5 of 9&#13;
aggressive counseling of patients to await the results of the slide examination.&#13;
At the end of three months over 70 percent of malaria patients waited for the&#13;
slide results. Fears that the increased wait might depress utilization were&#13;
unfounded as the visit rate increased slightly. The health impact of this change&#13;
on the incidence of p. falciparum malaria, which was found in the clinic to be&#13;
50 percent during December, is clear. These patients now receive effective&#13;
treatment which is fansidar and primaquine.&#13;
A clinic discovered, as it applied the standards for counseling, that patients did&#13;
not understand the messages.  This discovery was followed by direct&#13;
observation of the counseling session and, from this observation, changes were&#13;
made. First, awareness of the problem encouraged health workers to be more&#13;
directive and to probe for understanding. Second, where they could, health&#13;
workers removed crying children from the room during the counseling of&#13;
mothers. A third change, group counseling, will be implemented after a special&#13;
room for the purpose has been prepared. The results are encouraging. As an&#13;
example, nearly 100 percent of ARI patients now return for the two-day&#13;
control visit; formerly the return rate was less than 25 percent.&#13;
Concluding Remarks&#13;
10.   The consistency of the above findings encourages several conclusions. Specifically, the&#13;
following lessons emerge:&#13;
(a)   It is possible to get immediate and significant improvements in the quality of&#13;
basic health services provided by government facilities, which can be achieved&#13;
with a little investment in the development and establishment of a QA program.&#13;
(b)    A corollary to this lesson is that staff are quick to learn about technical quality&#13;
and need little external support to improve compliance with standards. Clinic&#13;
staff find the presence of clear standards of care reassuring. Consequently,&#13;
once motivated, they develop a variety of ingenious ways to remind themselves&#13;
of the standards and improve compliance. This experience has made frontline&#13;
health workers realized that they are the key to solving a lot of the quality&#13;
problems facing their facilities.&#13;
(c)    A common initial perception of health staff is that they can do little to improve&#13;
quality of care because of lack of resources. This resource-dependent mentality&#13;
was quickly broken by their systems analysis and problem-solving exercises.&#13;
(d)   A key to motivate staff is for high-level authorities to show that they are&#13;
strongly committed to quality improvement, and they will hold health center&#13;
directors accountable for establishing quality assurance mechanisms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14&#13;

practices in their facilities. In the field trial, while seven of the ten clinic&#13;
directors moved rapidly ahead in their quality improvement efforts, the three&#13;
others showed little or no inclination to get started. The appearance of senior&#13;
officials in the three clinics to make polite inquiry about the progress of the QA&#13;
program had a galvanizing effect.&#13;
11.   The pilot ran for only a few months; and the durability of the improvements is not yet&#13;
known. Therefore, a caveat is needed in making these conclusions. This notwithstanding, the&#13;
fact that the QA pilot performed as well as it did, and the weaknesses revealed are easy to&#13;
correct, provides a good empirical basis for BP IV's quality assurance program. MOH is now&#13;
ready to move ahead with a program that it finds suitable to Indonesia and regards as its own.&#13;
