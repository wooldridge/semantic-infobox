&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted&#13;
countries to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the&#13;
African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered&#13;
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations&#13;
Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
  Sectorwide&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Operationalize the WSSP and its proposed institutions in consultation with stakeholders.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Undertake a sector capacity needs assessment, and resource institutions to play assigned roles.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Prioritize WASH and increase the level of sector funding by linking PRS II and MDG targets to the domestic budget&#13;
     process.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	   Work towards a Sector-Wide Approach to:&#13;
&#13;
  	    o	   Capture and coordinate development partner budget and expenditure on WASH;&#13;
  	    o	   Build a national information management system for the sector that consolidates reporting on schemes being built&#13;
       		   and monitors functionality; and&#13;
  	    o	   Institute an annual multistakeholder review to evaluate progress and set priority actions for the sector.&#13;

1.	Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs)2 to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been produced in&#13;
collaboration with the Government of Liberia and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

National Water Resources and Sanitation Board (NWRSB): When established, the NWRSB will be responsible for sector policy, strategy, planning,&#13;
technical support, coordination, M&amp;E, HRD, capacity building, decentralization, programs, financing, NGO support, management information systems&#13;
(MIS), donor coordination and enforcement of standards, regulations and by-laws (including aspects of public health laws, and drinking water quality&#13;
standards in the Environmental Protection and Management Law). It will have oversight of the WSSC and other entities: (a) LWSC; (b) Rural Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation Bureau (RWSSB); and (c) Directorate for Community Mobilization and Hygiene Promotion (DCMHyP). Supporting the NWRSB will be the&#13;
National Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion Committee (NWSHPC). The Board will be made up of the highest level of representation per&#13;
ministry/agency and the NWSHPC will be made up of the technical staff that will be responsible for supporting the board.&#13;
Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MoLME): The Ministry leads in policy formulation and has been responsible for the preparation of the IWRM&#13;
Policy and the NWSP. Its water sector functions include provision of hydrological services (through the Liberia Hydrological Services Bureau), water&#13;
analysis, and collection of hydrological data. It is also mandated to provide assistance and advice with the siting of boreholes and wells, and drilling&#13;
techniques.&#13;
Ministry of Public Works (MoPW): It is in charge of infrastructure and basic services under Pillar IV in the PRS. It had led the sector coordination&#13;
at national level. The Ministry is engineering-focused, handling, among other tasks, the national rural water supply program. It also had oversight&#13;
responsibility for the LWSC. The Ministry implements directly, and/or through contractors and NGOs.&#13;
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW): It is responsible for health promotion and community mobilization, environmental and occupational&#13;
health, hygiene education and development of sanitation facilities. It is also responsible for ensuring the quality of domestic drinking water supply and&#13;
sanitation and hygiene practices pursuant to the Public Health Law and setting standards of water quality control and environmental health. Its mandate&#13;
includes, among others, waste management, disinfection, drinking water, industrial waste, and sewerage. Local level services are delivered through the&#13;
Division of Environmental and Occupational Health (DEOH).&#13;
Ministry of Education (MoE): The Division of School Health is responsible for school health and hygiene in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 4,900 schools (private and&#13;
public). It constructs hardware in collaboration with Education Facilities Unit in the Ministry. Software activities related to water supply and sanitation in&#13;
schools are developed in collaboration with the Department of Hygiene Promotion in the MoHSW.&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MoF): The Ministry is mandated to collect revenue; engage in loan arrangements, disburse government funds, and service the&#13;
national debt. State corporations such as the LWSC whose operations do not generate sufficient revenues to meet all O&amp;M, capital maintenance, and&#13;
loan repayments have to rely on the Ministry to stay in business.&#13;
National Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion Committee: This will be a resource group made up of the line ministries and service agencies,&#13;
civil society, and development partners. The committee will operationalize the NWSP, including the development of strategies to coordinate all water&#13;
supply and sanitation activities.&#13;
National Water Supply and Sanitation Commission (NWSSC): The NWSSC will act as the service regulator and developer and shall, among other&#13;
functions, establish measures and standards for water quality, serve as a regulatory authority on water and sanitation activities, and make policy&#13;
decisions on water and sanitation (supported by the NWSHPC) within the framework of national legal institutions/instruments. The NWSSC will also have&#13;
responsibility for (a) promoting the rights of access to basic water supply and sanitation; (b) setting standards and norms for consumer service standards;&#13;
(c) regulating tariffs charged to consumers; (d) issuing Water Services Provider Licenses; and (e) promoting public-private partnerships.&#13;
Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation (LWSC): The LWSC is mandated to (a) engage in the development, construction, installation, manufacture,&#13;
operation, transmission, distribution, sale, and supply to all urban areas of water and sewerage services; (b) establish and maintain water and sewer&#13;
facilities, offices and/or agencies within and everywhere inside Liberia; and (c) determine fair and reasonable rates, fees, and charges which shall be&#13;
charged in connection with the provision of water and sewage services. Some of these functions will be taken over by the NWSSC.&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Bureau (RWSSB): The primary role of the RWSSB will be hardware delivery, provision of technical expertise&#13;
and knowledge, and building capacity in rural Liberia. This is required in the short- to medium-term as County Administrations and the Community&#13;
Water and Sanitation Committees (CWSCs) have limited technical capacity to undertake implementation.&#13;
Other significant players in the sector include both local and international NGOs, civil society in the form of the WASH Working Group and the&#13;
private sector, which is yet to be adequately developed and resourced.&#13;

Financing of the sector has been weak, particularly from            subsector requirements and anticipated sources of funds,&#13;
the domestic side which annually allocates below 1 percent          including how complementary funding from revenues&#13;
of total annual government budget to the sector. This is            from users could be used to sustain services.&#13;
in large part a result of there being very little discretionary&#13;
budget to allocate to infrastructure development. The               Budgetingâ&#128;&#148;inadequate financing: Liberiaâ&#128;&#153;s PRS&#13;

is a target for sustainability of facilities.11&#13;

However, whilst the PRS is an instrument for setting sector&#13;
targets, the sector strategy and investment plan that will be                                 RSH&#13;

the 90-day PRS deliverables cycle which tries to report         priority actions for the sector. This would bring all sector&#13;
progress on a 90-day basis. This is a welcome idea but it       actors together to discuss sector plans and output as&#13;
is also contingent on what implementing partners report,        well as address its challenges. This should also involve a&#13;

Before 2000 there is little subsector data on which to base             Based on the coverage figures adopted by stakeholders in&#13;
estimates. The JMP includes the 1986 Demographic and                    the PRS1, and using the CSO2 costing model, an estimated&#13;

The scorecard (represented by Figure 11) shows that there&#13;
are concerns throughout the service delivery pathway&#13;
in the rural water subsector. Liberia scores low in the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;enablingâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;developingâ&#128;&#153; building blocks whilst it is just&#13;

In terms of developing services, the equity building block        O&amp;M costs for service delivery and whether there is&#13;

 All estimates for urban water supply coverage show a decline        US$11 million is anticipated from domestic and donor&#13;
 in coverage between 1990 and 2008. Over the period of               sources. Urban households are required to meet another&#13;
 review, the urban population has close to doubled, driven           US$11 million through cost recovering measures adopted&#13;
 by conflict-induced rural-urban migration. While JMP data           through current policy intentions. OPEX requirements are&#13;
 show a decline in coverage from 86 percent in 1990 to               estimated at US$8 million, and the ability to recover these&#13;
 79 percent in 2008, government estimates suggest a far              from user fees will determine the true extent of public&#13;
 greater drop in coverage to 30 percent coverage in 2008.            sector funding requirements.&#13;
 The PRS1 reports that Monroviaâ&#128;&#153;s water supply production&#13;
 fell from 18 million gallons daily to just 1 million gallons        The scorecard depicted in Figure 15 demonstrates that&#13;
 over the period of conflict. This has since recovered to            several of the building blocks in the service delivery&#13;

 Based on the coverage figures adopted by stakeholders for&#13;
 2008 for urban water supply, and using the CSO2 costing             Sector planning and coordination (for the sector as a&#13;
 model, an estimated annual US$36 million is required                whole) was very weak until early 2010 with only rough&#13;
 for investments in the subsector. Of this amount around             estimates of requirements to meet 2011 PRS1 targets in&#13;
 US$18 million is attributed to the public sector, of which          place. Since then a sector strategic plan has been under&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Liberia :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs2) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and
            what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's water and
            sanitation program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has
            been produced in collaboration with the Government of
            Liberia and other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis
            aims to help countries assess their own service delivery
            pathways for turning finance into water supply and
            sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and
            urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation, and
            hygiene. The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a
            review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the
            adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard which allows
            diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service
            delivery pathway. The CSO2's contribution is to answer
            not only whether past trends and future finance are
            sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific issues
            need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned
            into accelerated coverage in water supply and sanitation. In
            this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified
            through consultation. A synthesis report, available
            separately, presents best practice and shared learning to
            help realize these priority actions.
