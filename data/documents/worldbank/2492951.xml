        <abstracts>
            This Field Note descries experiences in
            hygiene promotion in the Oromia Regio of Ethiopia. Three
            water projects, funded by WaterAid, have also implemented
            hygiene and sanitation promotion approach which use a
            variety of channels of communication (Village Hygiene
            Communicators, Water and Sanitation Committees, Focus
            Groups, and District Health Staff) no pass key messages.
            Promotional methodologies include: demonstration latrines,
            use of participatory tools and practices, media campaigns,
            school visits, house-to-house visits, and child-to-child
            hygiene promotion. The Note presents advice and
            recommendations on the basis of this field experience
            regarding the use of these approaches for large-scale programs.
