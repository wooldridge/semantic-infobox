ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities and Expenditures and Governance Arrangements under&#13;
the South Asia Water Initiative Phase-2 Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements&#13;
entered into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide&#13;
contributions (the aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to&#13;
be administered by the Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The Project Development Objective is to increase regional cooperation in the&#13;
management of the Himalayan River systems to deliver sustainable, fair and inclusive&#13;
development and climate resilience.&#13;
(i)   Bank-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
SAWI will support activities relating to the management of river basins rising in&#13;
the Greater Himalayas, in the countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China,&#13;
India, Nepal and Pakistan. The program will be structured around five key Focus Areas:&#13;
the Ganges Basin, the Brahmaputra Basin, the Indus Basin, the Sundarbans Landscape,&#13;
and Regional Cooperation. Specific outputs and the outcomes to which they contribute&#13;
will be identified in the Focus Area Strategies at the basin, sub-basin/landscape, and&#13;
regional levels. At the Program level there will be two inter-related components:&#13;
Component 1: Building Cooperation and Governance&#13;
Systematic dialogue (e.g., policy and practice debates engaging governments, opinion-&#13;
makers, civil society, private sector and media) will be facilitated on transboundary&#13;
opportunities and policy development at the regional and national levels, and among&#13;
development partners. Efforts will be made to reach out to women and disadvantaged&#13;
groups in order to ensure that concerns and opportunities relating to gender and&#13;
inclusiveness are identified. These dialogues will lead to improved common&#13;
understanding, better priority setting, greater stakeholder ownership of interventions,&#13;
enabled policy environments, and calls for action.&#13;
Learning: Capacity Building. Prioritized shared learning activities will be delivered to&#13;
build capacity and skills, and to offer opportunities for regional practitioners to develop&#13;
de facto networks of practice. Particularly in fragile states, SAWI will support activities&#13;
to enhance the capacity of officials and other stakeholders to manage water (e.g., flood&#13;
forecasting, institutional development, basin modeling) and to engage in transboundary&#13;
activities (e.g., international water law, negotiations.) These efforts will contribute to&#13;
more effective engagement on transboundary issues, better management practices and&#13;
more successful implementation of related activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-                       November 1, 2013&#13;
Component 2: Supporting Knowledge and Investments&#13;
Knowledge: Analysis and Policy Development. High quality, policy relevant knowledge&#13;
bases will be built in at least three important basins or landscapes. The process of&#13;
knowledge development and dissemination will be emphasized to ensure quality,&#13;
ownership and uptake, and SAWI dialogues will be used as key platforms for knowledge&#13;
sharing. Accessibility (e.g., open access data platforms) will also be emphasized. These&#13;
efforts will contribute to more informed policy debates, greater legitimacy of&#13;
positions/decision taken and better designed interventions.&#13;
Action: Investment Design. Five genuine transboundary reform processes and/or&#13;
investments will be supported. Great potential exists in the region for transboundary&#13;
cooperation on water resources related opportunities and risks at different levels: at the&#13;
regional (e.g., hydro meteorological information, disaster risk management, hydropower&#13;
development), river basin (e.g., integrated river basin management, conjunctive use of&#13;
surface and groundwater, sediment management) and landscape levels (e.g., glaciers,&#13;
mangroves). These actions would contribute to greater sustainability and productivity of&#13;
rivers and ecosystems, the protection of lives and livelihoods against disasters, and&#13;
enhanced resilience to climate change. Potentially, these efforts could also help diminish&#13;
regional tensions around transboundary waters.&#13;
(ii)   Recipient-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
Supporting the client countries in specific activities to be carried out in line with&#13;
enhancing their capacity and in contributing to the SAWI-2 objectives, including: pilots,&#13;
capacity building, study tours, research grants, show cases, exchange of knowledge and&#13;
best practice on specific issues relevant to SAWI-2.&#13;
B. CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;
(i)    For Bank-Executed activities the Contributions may be used to finance: (a)&#13;
associated overhead; (b) consultant fees individuals and firms; (c) contractual services;&#13;
(d) equipment and office premises lease cost; (e) extended term consultants-No indirects;&#13;
(f) extended terms consultants; (g) field assignment benefits; (h) media, workshop,&#13;
conference and meeting; (i) staff costs - with indirect costs; (j) staff costs - no indirect&#13;
costs; (k) temporary support staff costs; and (1) travel expenses.&#13;
(ii)  For Recipient-Executed activities, the Contributions may be used to&#13;
finance: (a) civil works; (b) consultant services; (c) goods; (d) operating costs; (e)&#13;
training; and (f) grants.&#13;
The foregoing categories of expenditures may include the financing of taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-                     November 1, 2013&#13;
C. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE&#13;
An annual meeting of the MDTF Committee (SAWI Partners) will review&#13;
progress, update and approve the Focus Area Strategies, and finalize an Annual Report. It&#13;
will assess progress against planned results and consider what changes are needed to&#13;
maximize the likelihood that long term outcome indicators are achieved. Within the&#13;
components, the decision on allocation of funds will be based on Focal Area Strategies&#13;
and understandings reached during the annual meeting of the MDTF Committee.&#13;
The World Bank will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the&#13;
MDTF in accordance with administration arrangements with SAWI partners. The&#13;
responsibility of 'no-objection' to activities rests with the World Bank. The overall MDTF&#13;
will be supervised by the SAWI Team Leader/TF Manager, reporting directly to the&#13;
SASDI Sector Manager. The SAWI Team Leader/TF Manager and SASDI Sector&#13;
Manager will process all proposals in accordance with required fiduciary procedures and&#13;
the objectives of the Trust Fund. Individual Focus Area Leaders will be appointed and be&#13;
responsible for the development of the Focus Area Strategy and for reporting on&#13;
implementation progress. Individual Task Team Leaders will manage each grant funded&#13;
activity supported by the Trust Fund.&#13;
