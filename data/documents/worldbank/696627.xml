1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1   The province of Southeast Sulawesi (Sultra) covers a land area of 38,140 km2,&#13;
while Central Sulawesi (Sulteng) covers a much larger land area, about 63,689 km2. Sultra&#13;
has two Kabupatens which are part of the mainland Sulawesi Island. Two bigger islands,&#13;
Muna and Buton and some smaller islands make up its two remaining Kabupatens and&#13;
30 percent of its area. Most of Sulteng is on the main Sulawesi Island but the province&#13;
also has two medium island groups, the Banggai and Togian Islands, making up only&#13;
about 6 percent of the land area. Sultra's population was estimated at 1.5 million in 1994&#13;
with an average density of about 39 persons/km2. The province has one of the highest&#13;
population growth rates in the country, at about 3.7 percent per annum stemming from the&#13;
fact that transmigration has been an important part of the province's recent past (the&#13;
1980s). Sulteng had an estimated population of 1.9 million in 1994 and growing at about&#13;
2.8 percent per annum. Population density is very low (29 persons/km2) except in the&#13;
Palu valley where densities approach about 790 persons/km2.&#13;
1.2   Despite recent spurts of economic growth both provinces have low rural incomes&#13;
and welfare levels. The population is generally sparse and unevenly distributed with the&#13;
majority, 84 percent in Sultra and 85 percent in Sulteng, living in rural areas. The&#13;
provinces of Southeast and Central Sulawesi are characterized by immense cultural&#13;
diversity. In Sultra the major ethnic groups are Tolaki, the Tomekongga, and the&#13;
Tomoronene on the peninsula, and the Wolio, Munese and Butonese on the Islands of&#13;
Kabaena, Muna and Buton. In Sulteng there are reportedly 12 different ethnic groups and&#13;
possibly twice the number of linguistic groups. The major ethnic groups include the Kaili,&#13;
the Pamona, the Saluan, the Belantak, and the Banggai. Both provinces are now also&#13;
home to migrants from other parts of Sulawesi such as the Buginese, the Makasarese, the&#13;
Mandarese, the Gorontalos, the Manados, and the Bajaus as well as transmigrants from&#13;
Java, Bali and Lombok. These transmigrants in 1990 made up a non-negligible part of the&#13;
population of the two provinces (11 percent in Sultra and 6 percent in Sulteng).&#13;
1.3   Southeast and Central Sulawesi are two of Indonesia's provinces whose social&#13;
indicators are not as good as national average (Table 1.1 below). In each province the&#13;
estimated total population below the poverty line is above the national average. Both have&#13;
low life expectancy levels even among the Eastern provinces, higher infant mortality rates,&#13;
(surpassed only by NTB and East Timor in the East), high level of mal-nourishment and a&#13;
relatively low literacy level. Health statistics indicate that the areas served per health&#13;
center are on the high side especially for two relatively small provinces and hence&#13;
availability of health facilities appears to be poor.&#13;

Macroeconomic Background&#13;
1.4    Regional incomes, as measured by the Gross Regional Domestic Product excluding&#13;
oil and gas (GRDP), have been growing at reasonably high rates for the two provinces&#13;
since the early 1980s. The average annual GRDP growth rates were 7.2 percent for&#13;
Central and 8.5 percent (one of the highest in the country) for Southeast Sulawesi&#13;
between 1983-1992. These compare with a national GDP (without oil and gas) growth&#13;
rate of about 7.4 percent for the same period. Though GRDP growth rate in Central&#13;
Sulawesi (Sulteng) over 1983-92 was about equal to the average rate for the Eastern&#13;
provinces, the higher than average population growth rate of the province led to a per&#13;
capita GRDP growth rate below the regional average during the period.&#13;
1.5    The structure of the economy in Sulteng seemed to have changed rapidly between&#13;
1976 and 1983 when the share of agriculture fell from about 57 percent of GRDP to&#13;
42 percent. After 1983 however, the economic structure of the province changed very&#13;
little with agriculture maintaining its dominant role in the province's economy. As of 1992&#13;
agriculture's share of output was still 44 percent and employed about 68 percent of the&#13;
labor force. Southeast Sulawesi (Sultra) recorded one of the highest average GRDP&#13;
growth rates in Indonesia but it remains well behind other provinces in the country in&#13;
terms of the level of development. As of 1992, agriculture still dominated economic&#13;
activity in Sultra with a share of GRDP of about 44 percent and employing about&#13;
76 percent of the labor force. In both provinces, industry accounted for only a limited&#13;
share of provincial output and employment. Its contribution to output in 1992 was about&#13;
6 percent in Sulteng and 2.4 percent in Sultra. It also employed about 5.5 percent of the&#13;
labor force in Sulteng and 4 percent in Sultra.&#13;
1.6    Exports. As of 1991, the principal exports from Sulteng in value terms were&#13;
furniture and wooden construction materials (US$5.0 million), forest products (US$3.9&#13;
million) in the form of sawn timber (mostly ebony) and rattan, coconut products in the&#13;
form of oil and copra (US$2.8 million), and sea products US$0.9 million. While the main&#13;
exports from Sulteng have been from the agricultural sector, Sultra's principal exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
have been from the mining sector. In 1991 mining exports (mostly nickel) were US$52.4&#13;
million, compared to US$2.7 million for fishery products and US$ 1.7 million in forestry&#13;
products, mostly rattan.&#13;
The Agricultural Sector&#13;
1.7   The agricultural sector is the largest sector in the economy of both Southeast and&#13;
Central Sulawesi and provides the greatest source of employment. Growth in the&#13;
provincial economies has been led to a large degree by the agriculture sectors whose&#13;
growth rates averaged 7.7 percent per annum in Central and 8.0 percent per annum in&#13;
Southeast Sulawesi over 1983-92. These growth rates were considerably higher than the&#13;
3.2 percent national average growth rate of the sector during the same period. The&#13;
structures of the agricultural sectors of the two provinces are surprisingly very similar.&#13;
Within the agriculture sector, the food crops and estate crops sectors are dominant in both&#13;
provinces contributing approximately 75 percent of agricultural GRDP in 1992, with&#13;
about 40 percent of agricultural value-added coming from farm foodcrops, 35 percent&#13;
from the smallholder treecrop subsector. The contributions from the other subsectors were&#13;
10 percent from livestock, 12 percent from fisheries and about 3 percent from forestry.&#13;
1.8   The foodcrop subsector is still relatively large in both provinces and has been&#13;
growing annually at an average of about 5.9 percent and 4.4 percent respectively in&#13;
Central and Southeast Sulawesi. Paddy is the most widely planted food crop in both&#13;
provinces, but the area planted in Central Sulawesi (149,700 ha) is significantly larger&#13;
than the area planted in Southeast Sulawesi (74,100 ha). Major investments in irrigation&#13;
facilities in both provinces combined with more intensive extension efforts for paddy have&#13;
resulted in increases in production. However, average yields per hectare (3.3 tons) are&#13;
about 1.4 tons less than the national average and there is potential to further increase&#13;
output. Maize is the dominant staple food in some parts of Southeast Sulawesi (Muna and&#13;
Buton) and the total area planted is reported to be just over 48,500 ha in this province&#13;
while in Central Sulawesi only about 19,800 hectares are planted annually. Legume crops&#13;
have been increasing in importance as compared to paddy and maize. Of the legume&#13;
crops, soybeans are the most widely planted in both provinces (9,700 ha in Sultra and&#13;
14,600 ha in Sulteng). Other food sources, mainly sago, a food staple for some ethnic&#13;
groups, are widely harvested from swampy areas in parts of both provinces. Cassava is&#13;
also widely planted as a staple crop although it is less favored for consumption than rice.&#13;
1.9   In general, the smallholder treecrops subsectors in both provinces offer significant&#13;
potential to increase farmer incomes and to contribute to conservation of land resources.&#13;
While the subsector's contribution to agricultural GRDP did not change very much in&#13;
Sulteng between 1983 (32.4 percent) and 1992 (34.5 percent), it rose rapidly from 15&#13;
percent to 35 percent in Sultra during the same period. In Sulteng, coconut is the most&#13;
widely planted treecrop (164,390 ha) followed by cloves (51,500 ha), cocoa (29,900 ha),&#13;
The review in the next two sections is derived for the most part from the recent sector study on Eastern Islands&#13;
"Eastern Islands Rural Sector Strategy Review", Yellow Cover Report, November 1994&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
and coffee (17,400 ha). In Sultra, cashew nuts are the most widely cultivated treecrop&#13;
(123,900 ha), followed by cocoa (76,300 ha), coconuts (54,400 ha) and coffee (14,600&#13;
ha).&#13;
1.10  In Central Sulawesi, though the size of forestry output in total agricultural&#13;
production is still relatively small (3.2 percent in 1992), forestry sector output increased&#13;
faster than any other subsector at an average rate of over 13 percent per annum between&#13;
1983 and 1992. There appears however to be a problem of correctly monitoring forestry&#13;
exploitation because of a lack of facilities and personnel of the forestry service. For this&#13;
sector to continue to make a useful contribution to the province's economy, it is necessary&#13;
to carefully study, monitor, and manage the forests and critical watersheds as part of&#13;
forestry production and also in the agricultural and industrial development effort of the&#13;
province.&#13;
1.11   Livestock and especially fisheries are growth areas in the two provinces that have&#13;
good potential and for which market outlets exist outside the province and can make a&#13;
useful contribution to poverty reduction. In Sulteng, the average annual growth rate of&#13;
the fisheries sector over 1983-92 was 12 percent while for Sultra the rate was 11 percent.&#13;
In both provinces, fisheries contribute significantly to exports and directly support over 6&#13;
percent of all households in the two provinces. 2 The respective livestock sector growth&#13;
rates were 10 percent for Sulteng and 6 percent for Sultra.&#13;
Constraints to Agricultural Development&#13;
1.12   Natural and Physical Constraints. Most of the Sulawesi peninsula is&#13;
mountainous. The general terrain of Central Sulawesi and the northern part of Southeast&#13;
Sulawesi is characterized by a narrow coastal plain often only a few kilometers in width&#13;
and then steeply rugged mountain terrain still covered with forest. Central Sulawesi is a&#13;
crescent-shaped province whose economic, political and social structure is heavily&#13;
influenced by its geography. It is located on the equator, with high, steep elevations and&#13;
dense forest cover. The mountainous region and poor infrastructure have led to scattered&#13;
settlements and concentrations of population in the relatively more accessible but few&#13;
coastal plains, such as the Palu Valley with some consequences on the environment in such&#13;
areas. The soils in the northern part of the province are of volcanic origin, generally&#13;
fertile and well-drained and are very suitable for the production of estate crops. In the rest&#13;
of the province, the soils are of sedimentary and limestone origin, often less fertile than the&#13;
volcanic soils but still suited to treecrop production. Southeast Sulawesi has a generally&#13;
hilly and mountainous topography and only limited lowlands especially towards the north.&#13;
South of the east-west Kendari-Kolaka line the land is flatter and more open. Soils are&#13;
predominantly podsolic and Mediterranean, of limited fertility and, in certain parts, have&#13;
low water-holding capacity.&#13;
2   Eastern Islands Rural Sector Strategy Review, Chap 5 Pg. 99.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.13  Land use data show that forests cover about 72 percent of the land area in Sulteng&#13;
and 67 percent in Sultra and only about 10.3 percent in both provinces is used for&#13;
agriculture and settlements. In many upland areas however shifting cultivation and&#13;
extensive farming practices have expanded, resulting in soil erosion and loss of soil&#13;
fertility. Both provinces have areas of high rainfall, but also some of the lowest rainfall&#13;
areas in Indonesia. The general range of rainfall is between 800 to 3,000 mm except for&#13;
the Palu area and southern Muna and Buton where annual precipitation of as low as 400&#13;
mm have been recorded. The generally mountainous topography of the provinces results&#13;
in a diversity of localized micro-climates with unevenly distributed rainfall patterns during&#13;
the year, placing a constant strain on rainfed production.&#13;
1.14  Levels of Technology. In general, levels of productivity in the agricultural sectors&#13;
of the two provinces are below the national averages. There is therefore a significant&#13;
potential to increase yields for all commodities both foodcrops and treecrops through&#13;
introduction and dissemination of improved varieties and improved farming practices.&#13;
Major problems to be overcome in increasing average yields include: (a) inadequate&#13;
availability of improved seeds and seedlings for all commodities; (b) low demand for&#13;
fertilizers for crops other than paddy stemming from ineffective extension programs&#13;
introducing and explaining their use; (c) inadequate availability of and poor construction&#13;
of irrigation facilities especially in the smaller irrigated areas; (d) inadequate extension&#13;
programs to introduce effective pest management methods (including for vertebrate&#13;
pests); and (e) inadequate post-harvest practices and storage facilities. For dryland&#13;
cultivation, though population densities are low in the two provinces, the fragile nature of&#13;
the soils demands greater attention to preserve shallow top soils and reduce the&#13;
deterioration in soil fertility. This requires a change in the farming pattern of slash and&#13;
burn and shifting cultivation. The need for the introduction of conservation farming&#13;
techniques (hitherto not practiced) is therefore as important as in overcrowded Java and&#13;
Bali.&#13;
1.15  Infrastructure. Sultra remains one of the remotest provinces of Indonesia though&#13;
it has fairy good air and sea access to outside regions of South Sulawesi and Maluku.&#13;
Sulteng on the other hand is relatively more accessible. Within both provinces&#13;
transportation remains a key constraint. Paved roads connect most of the major towns but&#13;
most of them are in a state of disrepair. There remains therefore considerable scope for&#13;
further improving the state of the major road network. Regular ferry services and in some&#13;
cases "speed" boats connect the mainland to the major islands and Kabupatens and also to&#13;
the more remote islands and is the major means of transport in the region. Within each&#13;
province however there are numerous access roads, village paths, and tracks that are&#13;
impassable during the rainy season. In a lot of these areas, access by motor vehicles and&#13;
carts is constrained and frequently farmers must carry all inputs and output. Improvement&#13;
of these roads, as well as the main network of roads, would reduce transport costs and&#13;
boost marketing of agricultural produce.&#13;
1.16 Policies and Incentives Affecting Agricultural Production. National level trade&#13;
deregulation measures over the last five years have strongly impacted the treecrop&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
subsector in both Southeast and Central Sulawesi. Following the deregulation packages&#13;
of the early 1990s removing trade restrictions on coffee, copra and cocoa, the markets for&#13;
these crops have become quite competitive, with farmers receiving remunerative prices&#13;
and smallholder investments in these crops increasing sharply. 3 Under the general guise of&#13;
raising local revenues, there are still a number of local and provincial taxes (or retribusi)&#13;
imposed on the transport of certain commodities and animals and more especially on inter-&#13;
regional trade. Though these are generally of a nuisance value, their effect on production&#13;
and farmer incentives appears to be negligible. Despite the existence of a national quota&#13;
system on inter-provincial livestock trade, the quota system is not enforced in Sultra and&#13;
Sulteng and hence has no effect on livestock prices.&#13;
1.17  In some isolated cases, local district and even village authorities sometimes restrict&#13;
competition by requiring produce to be sold through the local cooperative (KUD) or&#13;
licensed traders. Following instructions from the Minister of Home Affairs (Keputusan&#13;
Menteri Dalam Negeri No. 48/1984, amended by KEPMEN No. 29/1986) supported by&#13;
instructions coming, from time to time, from the Governors to the Bupatis (e.g. Letter No.&#13;
512/1832/Ro. Ekon of 7 May 1994 from Governor of Central Sulawesi to all 4 Bupatis),&#13;
there doesn't appear to be any more unusual local marketing restrictions or any new&#13;
attempts by local authorities to limit competition by requiring produce to be sold through&#13;
the local cooperative (KUD) or only licensed traders. Inputs (especially fertilizer) continue&#13;
to be sold through the cooperatives and a limited number of licensed traders. This is&#13;
however related to the national fertilizer subsidy program and the policy of PUSRI, the&#13;
fertilizer company, to use only designated distributors. This system however does not&#13;
appear to affect the availability or price of inputs in the major centers and farmers who&#13;
have the means to acquire inputs should be able to get them either from Kabupaten or&#13;
from some kecamatan centers. The production of stock seed from the Kabupaten Seed&#13;
Centers (BBP) and extension seed from farmer seed growers provide less than half ofthe total&#13;
seed requirements of farmers who now rely mainly on low yielding local and degenerated HYV&#13;
varieties. Any new programs to improve agricultural productivity will therefore have to&#13;
address the seed supply issue.&#13;
1.18  Capital Availability and Investments. The public sector continues to make the&#13;
largest contribution to investments in the two provinces through the development budgets&#13;
(APBN, APBD I and APBD II). Of the total development expenditures, an average of&#13;
about 70 percent in Central Sulawesi and about 65 percent in Southeast Sulawesi came&#13;
from the national development budget APBN, though the share of the two local&#13;
development budgets had been increasing over the latter part of the Repelita V period.&#13;
The total development budgets for both Southeast and Central Sulawesi more than&#13;
doubled between the first and last years of Repelita V. They rose from about Rp. 99.6&#13;
billion for Southeast Sulawesi and Rp. 159.6 billion for Central Sulawesi in 1989/90 to&#13;
about Rp 221 billion and Rp 450 billion respectively in 1993/94. These compare to an&#13;
3   "Indonesia: Sulawesi 's Cocoa Boom - Lessons of Smallholder Dynamism and Hands Off Policy" April 1995.&#13;
Informal ESW Report EA3AG. Paper presented at Deregulation Conference; also Indonesia's Smallholder&#13;
Coffee - Benefits of Deregulation and Risks of Re-Regulation. Informal ESW EA3AG June 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
average estimated annual investment of around Rp 6 billion per province (2 percent and 1&#13;
percent of the development budgets of the two provinces) to be made under the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
1.19  In general, infrastructure and transportation has received the bulk of the&#13;
development expenditures, especially at the local level. Agriculture's share in the national&#13;
(APBN) and provincial (APBD I) development budgets has been slightly above 10&#13;
percent. At the Kabupaten level however the share of agriculture and irrigation in the&#13;
development budget (APBD II) has averaged less than 4 percent for the two provinces. In&#13;
1993/94, the annual development budget for agriculture from APBN and APBD TK I &amp; II&#13;
had risen to Rp. 35 billion for Central Sulawesi and to Rp 48 billion for Southeast&#13;
Sulawesi. On an annual basis, the proposed project investment would represent about 16&#13;
and 12.5 percent respectively of the annual agricultural development expenditures of the&#13;
two provinces. Private sector investments in treecrop production over the last several&#13;
years has been quite high though there is no data on the levels. Approved domestic and&#13;
foreign investments have in general fluctuated significantly from year to year but over time&#13;
have made up less than 0.9 percent of all domestic investment approvals in the country (11&#13;
percent of Eastern Indonesia) and less than 0.2 percent of all foreign investment approvals&#13;
(3 percent of the approvals in Eastern Indonesia).&#13;
1.20  Agricultural Credit. In the two provinces, transactions through the banking&#13;
system are very limited. The value added of the banking and financial services sector&#13;
remains very small, making up less than 1 percent of GRDP in Southeast and less than 2&#13;
percent in Central Sulawesi. Most banks, at best, only have branches at the Kabupaten&#13;
level and many of the promising rural financial service programs that have operated in the&#13;
past and still operate in the country, including the relatively more successful Unit Desas&#13;
(Kupedes) and P4K programs of the BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia) have operated only&#13;
marginally in the two provinces if at all. I Access of farmers and other small-scale&#13;
investors to financial resources therefore remains an important constraint for investment&#13;
and they cannot rely on the formal banking and financial system to provide their credit&#13;
needs. To avoid these problems of lack of access to credit facilities, sectoral projects&#13;
often come with their own arrangements and mechanisms for input supply and some&#13;
credit. As development projects and programs become regionalized, it would become&#13;
necessary to explore alternative forms of rural finance mechanisms for the rural&#13;
population, especially in the Eastern Islands. Experiences from Indonesia (Yogya Upland&#13;
Project, Integrated Swamps project) and elsewhere (Albania Rural Poverty Alleviation&#13;
Project, Benin Rural Savings and Loan Project) show that community-based savings and&#13;
credit systems can provide useful alternatives.&#13;
1.21 Institutional Constraints. Government's current policy aims at gradually&#13;
decentralizing responsibility for development to the local levels. Though there are&#13;
adequate numbers of local government staff at both the provincial and kabupaten levels,&#13;
there is a general lack of sufficiently trained and experienced staff to carry out the level of&#13;
4  Eastern Islands Rural Sector Strategy Review, Chap 3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
responsibilities that would accompany full and effective decentralization. Another&#13;
important constraint for regional planning and implementing development, concerns the&#13;
willingness and capacity of the local staff to take initiatives. Because the staff in the&#13;
regions have mostly implemented centrally managed programs, tend to have a lower level&#13;
of education, and limited experience, they are not accustomed to taking initiatives in&#13;
planning and targeting development. A review of institutional capacity of key government&#13;
and other agencies during project preparation identified the following constraints:&#13;
* limited formal and on-the-job training opportunities as well as inadequate&#13;
applied training;&#13;
* inadequate provision of equipment and facilities and low levels of discretionary&#13;
development funding at the kabupaten to support rural development activities&#13;
effectively;&#13;
* lack of reliable and relevant data on the regional (sub-district, district and/or&#13;
provincial) economy for the purposes of proper development planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
Experience with Area Development Operations.&#13;
2.1    Bank Wide Experience. 5 The Bank has supported a large number of area&#13;
development projects, 45 percent of them in Africa. These projects, however, fell into&#13;
disfavor in the mid-1980s following the evaluated poor performance of the earlier&#13;
projects. In several countries, a series of projects had been launched in quick succession,&#13;
leaving little time for learning and applying lessons from experience. Most evaluations, by&#13;
the Bank as well as other donors, associated poor performance of these projects with&#13;
project complexity and lack of flexibility, inadequate attention to village level institution&#13;
building and beneficiary participation, poor policy and incentive framework, and lack of&#13;
appropriate production technology, institutional capacity and government commitment.&#13;
Notwithstanding the poor track record, some area development projects have been quite&#13;
successful. OED studies have concluded that with good local management and&#13;
appropriate policy framework, this type of project can be very effective.&#13;
2.2   Indonesian Experience. Area development type projects in Indonesia have been&#13;
implemented with varying degrees of success and impact on poverty alleviation. Lack of&#13;
sustainable technological packages for land and crop development, shortages of family&#13;
labor, inadequate agricultural support services and poor inter-agency coordination were&#13;
major constraints to realization of the development objectives of the swamp development&#13;
projects, the transmigration projects, and the two upland area development projects&#13;
(Yogyakarta Rural Development and the Upland Agriculture and Conservation projects)&#13;
financed by the Bank. The Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) for three of the&#13;
five transmigration projects concluded that while the resettlement objectives of these&#13;
projects were satisfactorily achieved, the planned agricultural development necessary to&#13;
generate income and employment for the transmigrants was deficient. 6 The first Bank-&#13;
financed non-transmigration related area development project in Indonesia, the&#13;
Yogyakarta Rural Development project, was also judged unsatisfactory by the PPAR on&#13;
grounds of over-ambitious project objectives, faulty project design, and non-replicable and&#13;
non-sustainable land development technology. 7&#13;
2.3   To some extent these problems were addressed in the design and/or during&#13;
implementation of the second generation projects such as the Nusa Tenggara Agricultural&#13;
Support Project (NTASP; 1986), and the Yogyakarta Upland Area Development Project&#13;
(YUADP; 1991), resulting in their better implementation and development impact. These&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
projects have made important contributions to the development of local level institutions,&#13;
processes for decentralized planning, implementation of development activities, and&#13;
experimented with approaches for beneficiary participation and use of project area CDOs.&#13;
The NTASP and the UACP have been generating location specific upland and arid/semi-&#13;
arid farming technologies, and fostering the much needed operational linkages between&#13;
research and extension in the project areas.&#13;
2.4   Lessons Learnt. The main lessons learnt from the implementation of the two area&#13;
development projects in Indonesia, NTASDP and YUADP, and as reflected in their&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports are consistent with those from some 300 such Bank&#13;
wide projects. These show that to succeed, area development projects need: (a) clear and&#13;
unequivocal long-term political commitment to and policy support for rural development&#13;
and poverty alleviation objectives; (b) beneficiary participation in the identification,&#13;
planning and implementation process in order to ensure their 'ownership' of the project;&#13;
(c) realistic, simple and flexible project design based on objective diagnosis of&#13;
development constraints and their possible solutions; (d) proven technology and support&#13;
services for production growth, or effective measures for technology development and&#13;
their adoption during project implementation; (e) demonstrated institutional capability at&#13;
the local level for project implementation, or effective measures to strengthen existing&#13;
institutions early in project implementation; (f) routine monitoring and periodic evaluation&#13;
of project implementation and impact, as a basis for 'mid-course' corrections; and (g) to&#13;
avoid the involvement of excessive number of agencies and satisfactory inter-agency&#13;
coordination where integrated/simultaneous implementation of several different&#13;
components are necessary for synergistic benefits. In addition, experience has shown that&#13;
sustainability of development impact is enhanced if the project structure is integrated with&#13;
standard local development administration, rather that a super-imposed specialized project&#13;
administration. The proposed project will incorporate these lessons through simple and&#13;
flexible design and by limiting activities principally to the agricultural sector. Mid-Term&#13;
evaluation will also be an important feature of the project for project redesign in response&#13;
to any changed circumstances.&#13;

2.5    Government's overall strategy for growth, poverty alleviation and regional&#13;
development has had the following key elements: (a) fostering rapid growth of the major&#13;
income and employment generating sectors of the economy: agriculture, industry, and&#13;
services; (b) promoting rural urban linkages and migration out of overpopulated and&#13;
resource constrained areas; and (c) investing in physical infrastructure and human resource&#13;
development. For reasons of social equity and regional balance however, the Government&#13;
of Indonesia (GOI) has placed particular emphasis on the development of the eastern&#13;
islands during the Second Development Period, PJP II, and during REPELITA VI. GOI&#13;
strategy for the East emphasizes human resource and physical infrastructure development,&#13;
productivity gains in agriculture, agribusiness and small scale village processing, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
integrated area development activities. The specific strategy for the project areas is similar&#13;
to the rest of the East and puts emphasis on:&#13;
*  agricultural development, with particular emphasis on productivity increases,&#13;
agri-business, development of potential irrigation sites, and improvements in&#13;
agricultural services;&#13;
*  infrastructure development, particularly road transportation, facilities for inter-&#13;
island transport, and communications infrastructure;&#13;
*  human resource development;&#13;
*  industrial development, particularly in the form of agro-processing and mining;&#13;
and&#13;
*  deconcentration of governmental activities and some decentralization of&#13;
decision making, giving increasing powers to the local level institutions on&#13;
development administration;&#13;
2.6    The last element of the strategy dealing with decentralization is particularly&#13;
important for Government's regional development program. It is expected to be linked&#13;
with increased general purpose transfers that would permit provinces and districts to&#13;
finance their development programs without restrictions from the center and permit them&#13;
to provide counterpart funds directly for externally funded projects. Two elements of&#13;
government's strategy that is important for poverty alleviation and hence relevant to the&#13;
Eastern regional development effort is the recently instituted INPRES Desa Tertinggal&#13;
(IDT), designed specifically to target villages that are at or below the poverty level and the&#13;
integrated area development program (PPWT) sponsored by the Ministry of Home Affairs&#13;
through its regional development directorate, BANGDA.&#13;
2.7    Regional Development Objectives. Regional development objectives in both&#13;
Southeast and Central Sulawesi as contained in their respective regional development&#13;
plans, reflect those at the national level and emphasize: (i) achieving sustainable economic&#13;
growth; (ii) reducing the incidence of poverty through broad-based income generation;&#13;
and (iii) promoting a more equitable pattern of growth to reduce inter-regional disparities.&#13;
In both of these provinces, the key regional development priorities are:&#13;
rural and community development;&#13;
improvements in agricultural productivity;&#13;
development of agro-industry and agri-business;&#13;
roads and infrastructure development to support regional development;&#13;
natural resource conservation; and&#13;
human resource development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Investments from both the public and private sectors are expected to be directed to these&#13;
areas during REPELITA VI to achieve the targeted growth.&#13;
Bank's Strategy&#13;
2.8    Agricultural Sector Strategy. The main objectives of the Bank's evolving&#13;
strategy in the agricultural sector are to ensure agricultural growth with distributional&#13;
equity, and to assist in rural poverty alleviation through income generation.8 To achieve&#13;
this, the Bank envisages an increased emphasis on regional operations, designed: (a) to&#13;
adapt development programs to the specific constraints and conditions of each area or&#13;
region involved; (b) to improve and focus provision of agricultural services (extension,&#13;
research, input distribution, etc.) in needed areas; (c) to elicit an increased local&#13;
participation in planning and implementation of operations; and (d) to strengthen local&#13;
institutions to be effective in assisting farmers in increasing their incomes and in evaluating&#13;
development effectiveness.&#13;
2.9    While agriculture is unlikely to be a major source of growth in the Indonesian&#13;
economy as a whole in the near future, growth in the sector is still a key element of&#13;
development and poverty alleviation strategy in provinces such as those in the proposed&#13;
project regions where a high percentage of the population depends on agriculture and&#13;
where 40 to 50 percent of regional GDP still comes from agriculture. Thus the Bank's&#13;
focus would be to develop agricultural operations which raise productivity, rural incomes&#13;
and reduce poverty in the regions as a complement to sector-wide investments, national&#13;
policy reforms, and institutional change. In the remote, resource-poor regions where&#13;
poverty is more entrenched, such as the Eastern Islands, the Bank's strategy would be to&#13;
implement carefully designed and special interventions addressing issues of sustainable&#13;
improvements in farm incomes and productivity, and off-farm incomes where possible.&#13;
Project design also seeks to ensure appropriate support to non-agricultural activities that&#13;
directly affect agricultural production. The project would thus include activities, such as&#13;
village infrastructure that would support the rural development process and poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;
2.10   Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement. The above&#13;
strategy and proposals included in the proposed project are consistent with the Bank's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia, discussed in the meeting of Executive&#13;
Directors held on March 21, 1995, supports the Government in the following key areas:&#13;
(a) maintaining growth with macro-economic stability; (b) enhancing competitiveness; (c)&#13;
reducing poverty; (d) enhancing human resource development; and (e) managing&#13;
resources sustainably. The proposed project reflects the more decentralized region-&#13;
specific approach that is now emerging and is consistent with the Bank assistance&#13;
strategy's basic approaches for poverty alleviation and decentralization of development&#13;
activities. The project has a poverty-reduction emphasis, promotes sustainable food&#13;
8   Report No. 10504-lND "Indonesia: Agricultural Transformation Challenges and Opportunities" Chap 6. Also&#13;
Eastern Islands Rural Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
security, and enhances competitiveness in areas such as tree crops where the provinces&#13;
have a comparative advantage. This strategy is consistent with GOI's approach to&#13;
agricultural development. The Bank's broad experience in the agriculture sector in&#13;
Indonesia, its projects in the eastern islands, in particular the recently completed Nusa&#13;
Tenggara project (NTASP) and the adaptive research program just starting under the&#13;
second Agriculture Research Management (ARM 2) project, its sector work (Eastern&#13;
Island Rural Sector Strategy Study of 1994), and its complementary lending program in&#13;
eastern Indonesia, emphasizing rural and market infrastructure, town development and&#13;
community health and nutrition, put the Bank in a unique position to provide assistance&#13;
for the region's agricultural development effort.&#13;
2.11   The proposed project complements ongoing Bank-financed infrastructure and&#13;
human resources development projects in the region. In particular, the Eastern Indonesia&#13;
Kabupaten Roads Project (Loan 3579-IND, 1993, US$155 million); the Water Supply and&#13;
Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (Loan 3629-IND, 1993, US$80 million);&#13;
the Third Health Project (Loan 3042-IND, 1989, US$43.5 million); and the Third&#13;
Nutrition and Community Health Project (Loan 3550-IND, 1993, US$93.5 million)&#13;
address basic human needs and improve linkages between farms and markets. The&#13;
proposed Sulawesi Towns Assistance and Development Project is also expected to&#13;
provide key complementary marketing infrastructure in the major towns of the project&#13;
area. This would support the agricultural production activities of the proposed project.&#13;
The Government's strong focus on infrastructure in the region will also assist the strategy.&#13;
2.12  The Second Agricultural Research Management Project (ARM II, Loan 3886-&#13;
IND, 1995, US$63.0 million) will strengthen farming systems research throughout the&#13;
country through decentralized budgeting, local control and identifying and promoting&#13;
technologies appropriate to the local ecosystems. The ARM II Project will finance eight&#13;
regional Assessment Institutes including the two in the project area, one at Biromaru (to&#13;
cover North and Central Sulawesi) and the other at Kendari (to cover Southeast and&#13;
South Sulawesi). These institutes are expected to generate location specific technologies&#13;
that will provide a strong technical underpinning for agricultural development being&#13;
promoted under the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Origin&#13;
3.1    Historically, Bank support for the agricultural sector has been through projects&#13;
financed through central sectoral agencies - sectoral operations with components in the&#13;
provinces. A number of these operations have and continue to have a positive impact on&#13;
poverty reduction and the growth of the regions, especially when they have financed&#13;
irrigation and other infrastructure or sought to transfer know-how and technology from&#13;
one area to the other, and where central coordination is required. The recent Eastern&#13;
Islands Rural Sector Strategy Study however strongly argued for area development&#13;
operations that would not only complement the sector projects but would seek to improve&#13;
the impact of development operations by: (a) reflecting specific local conditions (e.g.,&#13;
farming systems, soil conditions, etc.) in project design; (b) taking into account the&#13;
immediate priorities of the regions; and (c) permitting a high level of beneficiary&#13;
participation in planning and implementation. 9 The proposed project responds to this&#13;
recommendation from the study.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
3.2   The overall objectives of the project are to assist Government in reducing the&#13;
incidence of poverty in the provinces of Central and Southeast Sulawesi through the&#13;
increase of rural incomes, the promotion of equitable regional development, the promotion&#13;
of environmentally sustainable farming practices, and the strengthening of local level&#13;
institutions. Its specific project objectives are:&#13;
*  to increase farmer productivity and incomes;&#13;
* to promote environmentally sustainable farming practices; and&#13;
* to improve the capacity of local institutions to identify, prepare, appraise and&#13;
manage agricultural development programs.&#13;
Project Target Areas&#13;
3.3    A number of project target areas and activities have been selected by local&#13;
government authorities based on inputs from the rural population in the bottom-up&#13;
planning process that went into the preparation of Repelita VI. Other priority areas and&#13;
activities were also added following field discussions during preparation. The main criteria&#13;
that guided the selection of project locations were:&#13;
a) to reach a large number of households below or near the poverty line,&#13;
9   Eastem Islands Report op. cit. Chap. 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
b) to provide assistance to areas with significant potential for agricultural&#13;
development that have hitherto been neglected or only marginally been touched&#13;
by other operations;&#13;
c) to cover areas identified as requiring special attention in the provincial and&#13;
district Repelita VI; and&#13;
d) areas where there is a minimum level of government support services as well as&#13;
infrastructure to connect them to regional centers.&#13;
3.4   The proposed project will be implemented in all eight Kabupatens of the provinces&#13;
of Southeast and Central Sulawesi, with particular focus on the lesser developed&#13;
Kecamatans. The target areas selected in Central Sulawesi are located in 27 Kecamatans&#13;
with a total land area of some 22,500 sq. km (35 percent of the land area) and covering&#13;
585 villages of which 286 or 49 percent have been classified as poor. The target area has&#13;
an estimated population of 625,000 people (129,000 households) or 33 percent of the&#13;
province's population . The target areas in Southeast Sulawesi are in 25 Kecamatans,&#13;
with a land area of 22,000 sq. km (58 percent of the area) and would involve some 289&#13;
villages of which about 160 or 55 percent are classified poor. The estimated population of&#13;
the target area is 426,000 (84,100 households) or 31 percent of the total population. The&#13;
target areas in general, are outside of the traditional areas that receive donor assistance&#13;
around Kendari and Palu.&#13;
Detailed Project Features&#13;
3.5   The project has three broad components covering: (a) agriculture-based area&#13;
development; (b) capacity strengthening and project management; and (c) farming systems&#13;
and fisheries research support and technology transfer.&#13;
Component A: Agriculture-Based Area Development (US$ 26.4 million; 80 percent&#13;
of total base cost)&#13;
3.6   This component aims to improve agricultural productivity, incomes and levels of&#13;
welfare of rural households in the 54 Kecamatans by implementing a program of&#13;
agricultural development activities. A secondary objective would be to improve the pattern&#13;
of agricultural land use and reduce soil erosion and loss of soil fertility from traditional&#13;
farming practices. Several activities (described below) have been identified to constitute a&#13;
core menu from which the specific activities for each area have been proposed, taking into&#13;
account the area's resource base. The menu identified includes: improved cropping in&#13;
village irrigation schemes, dryland farming systems development, cattle distribution,&#13;
household technology packages, and vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease.&#13;
In addition, the project would also support the improvement of critical road sections,&#13;
bridges and culverts to improve communications between farms and markets, and includes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
an as yet unidentified component of other development activities to be proposed by local&#13;
communities during implementation.&#13;
3.7   The agricultural development activity in each area would consist of direct input&#13;
and equipment support for demonstration plots in farmers' fields, and basic extension and&#13;
financial support for replication in the farming activities included in the menu. A village&#13;
level revolving credit system (following a successful model developed in an Albania&#13;
operation and also a similar one in the ongoing Yogyakarta Upland Project) will be set up&#13;
to provide the financial support for the replication program. Annual work programs and&#13;
budgets for each area would be based on a community-based planning system. Existing&#13;
women farmer groups (wanita tani) would have the same access to the village revolving&#13;
credit system, as well as any other project support available to other farmer groups.&#13;
3.8   Activities would be grouped into four sub-components: (a) Crop Development&#13;
program (including foodcrop and tree crop activities); (b) livestock production and&#13;
veterinary care; (c) Farm access roads; and (d) Community-based initiatives.&#13;
3.9   Crop Development Program. The crop development program would cover&#13;
foodcrop, horticulture and treecrop production systems. The main activities to be&#13;
financed would include:&#13;
(a) Irrigation Farming System. The project would finance improvement of&#13;
agricultural practices on village irrigation schemes where water control&#13;
structures are being constructed under the Governments crash Village&#13;
Irrigation Program (PID). The project would support the establishment of&#13;
demonstration plots of 3 ha each in adjacent 0.5 ha farm plots involving six&#13;
farmers in each of the 203 irrigation schemes being rehabilitated in the project&#13;
area, and support improved seed multiplication for rice, soybean, mungbean&#13;
and maize. This would average about 2 ha seed multiplication units for each 3&#13;
schemes for a total of 20 seed units in Southeast and about 48 units for&#13;
Central. In addition the project includes extension support for improved&#13;
irrigation cultivation (Annex 1 Section A). Farmers would be able to obtain&#13;
credit under the village revolving credit scheme for replication (Annex 1&#13;
Section I).&#13;
(b) Dryland Farming. The project would finance the introduction and extension&#13;
support for the promotion of conservation (dryland) farming technology for&#13;
upland farmers using alley-cropping, bench terracing, contour ridge terracing&#13;
(covering treecrops, fruit trees and foodcrops), soil conservation techniques,&#13;
and rehabilitation of smallholder treecrop plantations. Some of these dryland&#13;
technology packages have recently been introduced in some of the Eastern&#13;
Island provinces such as NTB and NTT though they are more widely practiced&#13;
in the uplands of the more heavily populated Java and Bali. The technology&#13;
packages are also practiced in small pockets of Sulawesi with support from&#13;
community development organizations (CDO). To introduce the packages, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
project would support establishment of some 90 conservation farming&#13;
demonstration plots of 3 ha each in Southeast and 210 plots of 3 ha each in&#13;
Central Sulawesi."' (Annex 1 Section C)&#13;
(c) Treecrop Rehabilitation. The project would also provide for demonstration&#13;
of rehabilitation of existing overgrown cashew and cacao farms. In each case&#13;
there will be 3 ha demonstration plots in the cacao or cashew villages. There&#13;
will be a total of 72 cacao demonstration plots (covering 216 ha) in Central&#13;
Sulawesi and 90 plots (270 ha) each of cacao and cashew demonstration in&#13;
Southeast Sulawesi. The project would also provide support for the&#13;
establishment of one small private treecrops nursery for every 3 villages to&#13;
provide improved seedling (Annex 1 Section E). The project also includes&#13;
arrangements for the provision of group credit to give farmers access to&#13;
liquidity they can use to finance inputs they would need to replicate the new&#13;
technology.&#13;
(d) Household Plots. The component includes promotion of packages through&#13;
extension support and demonstration activities to upgrade existing household&#13;
technologies (such as house gardens, improved hearths, drying floors etc.),&#13;
which are traditionally the responsibilities of women (Annex 1 Section F).&#13;
3.10  In order to ensure that farmers who want to adopt and replicate project activities&#13;
and project introduced technology have the means to do so, the project would finance a&#13;
village-level revolving credit fund that would make liquidity available to farmer groups for&#13;
input purchase, crop marketing and agricultural processing. Government has agreed at&#13;
negotiations to pass on the credit as a grant to villages. Despite the fact that funds will be&#13;
a grant to participating villages, farmer groups and individual farmers would have to repay&#13;
the credit with a minimum interest rate of 15 percent per year in the initial years and a&#13;
higher rate in the latter years so that the fund continues to serve village members in the&#13;
future. Individual communities will however be able to charge higher rates if they wish.&#13;
Each participating village would receive an initial revolving credit that would not exceed&#13;
Rp 10 million for on-lending to villagers, farmers, and farmer groups in the village. For&#13;
replication credits the technical services (Dinas/PPLs) would need to assure themselves&#13;
that the groups in question are adopting the recommended technology. Repayment would&#13;
be after the planting season and would be made to a special account to be opened by each&#13;
village at the nearest institution providing deposit services, expected to be either a&#13;
commercial bank or post office (pos giro). While the basic objective of the program would&#13;
be to ensure that farmers are able to replicate the agricultural programs, it was agreed that up&#13;
to 40 percent of the village funds can be on-lent for agricultural processing and marketing to be&#13;
undertaken by the villagers or groups within the village. The main criteria and procedures&#13;
agreed on for the operation of the program during negotiations are summarized above, and are&#13;
given in detail in Annex 1 Section I.&#13;
10  This implies that there would be a demonstration plot established in one out of every three villages in the&#13;
project area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.11   Livestock Management and Veterinary Care. This program would include:&#13;
distribution of breeding cattle and bulls through a revolving credit system, in priority to&#13;
farmers who have successfully participated in the crop production program of&#13;
conservation farming and village irrigation programs; advice to farmers to establish plots&#13;
for fodder crops; veterinary programs through improvements to existing animal health&#13;
clinics; and provision of vaccines and other materials to cover vaccination of an average of&#13;
about 700 chicken each in all project villages. Receipts from the sale of the vaccines is&#13;
expected to set up a revolving credit to cover the chicken vaccination program for&#13;
prevention of Newcastle disease. The program is expected to be managed by the existing&#13;
women's group, PKK (Annex I Sections H &amp; G).&#13;
3.12   As recommended in the Eastern Islands sector study " management of the&#13;
redistribution of cattle and of the cattle revolving credit would be done by the community.&#13;
Sub-Kecamatan livestock committees L2/ are to be set up (regrouping heads of villages and&#13;
representatives of farmer groups) to be responsible for ensuring recuperation of the&#13;
livestock credit and redistribution of second generation cattle to farmers who have not yet&#13;
received the cattle and who meet the criteria to receive it. The committees would be&#13;
assisted by a working group for livestock distribution to be formed at each kecamatan and&#13;
to be composed of the Mantri Ternak, PPLs for livestock, staff of the animal health&#13;
clinics, village chiefs, and representatives of farmer groups, the kecamatan community&#13;
development facilitator (CDF), and staff of the Livestock Dinas TK II. Under the&#13;
supervision of the Dinas TK IIIPIMPRO, the livestock group would be responsible for&#13;
selecting the desa's and farmer groups to receive cattle and for cattle procurement.&#13;
3.13   Farm Access Roads. In order to reduce transportation bottlenecks, especially&#13;
from farm-to-market and between villages, the project would support the construction of&#13;
critical bridges, culverts, and road sections on village access roads. Local government&#13;
funding and community participation would be mobilized to improve the surfacing for&#13;
these access roads as necessary. Other village infrastructure such as simple village docks&#13;
and jetties, marketing and storage facilities may also be financed. Ideally, allocations for&#13;
each kecamatan and village should reflect their infrastructure needs. However, in order to&#13;
ensure that there is equity in providing the infrastructure and to ensure that local&#13;
participation will be maximized, an upper limit of some US$250,000 per kecamatan is&#13;
proposed. In order to get the maximum participation of the population in the road&#13;
construction program, it will be implemented by the village resilience group, LKMD as is&#13;
currently being done under the village infrastructure projects (VIP) being financed by the&#13;
Bank and OECF. Design and technical support would be provided by the Public Works&#13;
Dinas. A rural infrastructure construction manual, already prepared for the VIP project in&#13;
Bahasa Indonesia, will be adapted during the first project year and will be used for&#13;
implementing the component. A consultant rural engineer/contracts specialist will be&#13;
Il Eastern Islands Report op. cit Chap. 6&#13;

representative from one of the villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
recruited by the project to oversee the construction program and help with procurement&#13;
and contracting. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) the infrastructure&#13;
construction manual will be finished by March 31, 1997, for use in the road construction&#13;
program; (b) allocations for the village infrastructure program, per kecamatan involved in&#13;
the project, will not exceed the equivalent of US$250,000; (c) priority would be given to&#13;
villages where needs are demonstrated to be the highest, the population is committed to&#13;
contribute actively to the implementation of the works, and local government has agreed&#13;
to maintain the completed works. The upper limit would be reviewed during the mid-term&#13;
review of the project (Annex 1 Section J).&#13;
3.14  Community Based Initiatives. The project would support local initiatives&#13;
expected to result in direct benefits to the communities. The sub-component would allow&#13;
village communities opportunities to propose priority activities that may not have been&#13;
included in the core menu of activities (post-harvest processing, goat distribution, spring-&#13;
fed village water supply, marketing and storage facilities, support for pilot village-run&#13;
credit schemes, etc.), or to permit further replication of particularly successful programs.&#13;
While the sub-component would seek to finance productive activities, it can also provide&#13;
other forms of support covering social-type (but non-religious) activities that can be&#13;
demonstrated to be in the manifest interest of the rural population, including providing&#13;
assess of women's and youth groups to CDO assistance, demonstration programs and&#13;
other project activities. Technically and economically feasible activities considered to be a&#13;
high priority by the local communities would be implemented using discretionary&#13;
supplemental project funding to be provided through the project. Though no specific limit&#13;
has been set, it is expected that each kecamatan would receive about Rp 90 million during&#13;
the project (equivalent to some Rp 22.5 million or US$10,000 annually for four years).&#13;
Community development activities are expected to be implemented with support from&#13;
CDOs. Procedures and criteria for selecting CDOs were discussed and agreed on during&#13;
negotiations and these are reported below in para 5.10.&#13;
3.15  Proposals would be made annually through the village level planning process and&#13;
with support from community development facilitators to be recruited under the project.&#13;
The village level proposals, formulated by farmer groups and/or villages with assistance&#13;
from the community development facilitators, will be consolidated at the kecamatan level&#13;
and reviewed to prioritize those with the greatest socio-economic impact and those&#13;
expected to improve rural incomes. The purpose of the review will be to ensure that&#13;
proposed activities meet the necessary criteria and to rank the activities coming from the&#13;
kecamatan by order of priority. The proposals will be forwarded to the Kabupaten, where&#13;
the project steering committee would review the proposals to ensure that they conform to&#13;
criteria for the component acceptable to the Bank and decide on those to be financed.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. The criteria for financing&#13;
activities under this component, discussed and agreed on at negotiations, are detailed in&#13;
Annex 1 Section K. They include the following:&#13;
. activities have to be identified by the population to be of high priority;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
*  the population has to demonstrate that the activity is in their manifest interest by&#13;
their willingness to contribute at least their labor to the realization of the activity;&#13;
* the population has to demonstrate their willingness to provide for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of activities financed under the sub-component.&#13;
*  activities involving women and youth groups&#13;
3.16  The Implementation Schedule for activities under the Crop Development Program&#13;
is displayed in Annex 7 Table 1.&#13;
Component B: Project Management and Capacity Strengthening of Local Agricultural&#13;
Support Services: (US$ 5.1 million; 15 percent of total base cost).&#13;
3.17  The large part of the component would finance activities related to project&#13;
implementation and management, but since the project will be managed by local agencies,&#13;
the component will also serve to strengthen the capacity of these local agricultural and&#13;
development institutions to plan, design, prepare, monitor, coordinate and evaluate a&#13;
multi-sectoral package of development activities. The proposed project envisages&#13;
financing of, training, equipment and vehicles (in particular motorcycles for field staff),&#13;
improvement of agency facilities, and provision of operating means for institutions&#13;
involved in the delivery of agricultural support services at the provincial and district levels.&#13;
3.18   Rehabilitation and Improvement of Facilities. The project would: rehabilitate a&#13;
total of 25 rural extension centers (BPPs) and 4 animal health clinics (poskeswans) in the&#13;
two provinces. There will not be any new construction either of BPPs orposkeswans.&#13;
However, in the rehabilitation program for the BPPs, for areas where there are no&#13;
poskeswans, the project would finance the refurbishing of an existing room or the addition&#13;
of a new room to provide animal health services. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that before any of these facilities would be considered for rehabilitation under&#13;
the project, detailed management and operational plans would be implemented for the&#13;
facility covering the following:&#13;
*  staffing levels for the concerned BPP andlor poskeswan (both current and&#13;
anticipated) including where anticipated staff would come from;&#13;
*  current annual funding (operational and maintenance budget) and funding&#13;
requirements to support full and effective operation of the center or clinic;&#13;
*  coverage of the BPP/poskeswan in terms of area and number of farmers to be&#13;
reached;&#13;
*  for each BPP, principal or leading sector the BPP covers, and hence the&#13;
coordinating Dinas for the center. The plan should however include proposed&#13;
budgetary arrangements for ensuring that all participating sectors (in addition&#13;
to the leading sector) contribute to the functioning of the BPP; and&#13;
*  for each Poskeswan or its one-room extension, a program to ensure cost&#13;
recovery and budgeted maintenance of the clinic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.19 Kabupaten Seed Multiplication Centers. The Government of Indonesia, since&#13;
the introduction of the BIMAS (mass guidance) in the early sixties, has considered seed&#13;
production to be one of the five major aspects in foodcrops (especially rice) production&#13;
improvement. The provision of foundation seed has therefore traditionally been the&#13;
responsibility of research. First stage multiplication has normally been done by provincial&#13;
and kabupaten seed farms for distribution to farmers. The seed multiplication program has&#13;
been supported by various Government policies on seed certification. Private sector&#13;
involvement in this area has been virtually non-existent since the B1MAS subsidized seed&#13;
policy kept them out in a major way from seed production. However, the implementation&#13;
of the BIMAS seed policies has faced major constraints at provincial and kabupaten level,&#13;
so that the availability of extension seeds at the farming level is not sufficient, in particular&#13;
in the more remote areas in Indonesia, away from Java and Bali and the operation of&#13;
existing seed multiplication centers has been poor. The project would provide some funds&#13;
to rehabilitate and to support the operation of one seed center per Kabupaten to produce&#13;
stock seed, for multiplication by seed farmers, provided a management plan is prepared&#13;
and implemented for each center to be supported. The Plan would cover:&#13;
-  operational program to produce the required stock seed based on available&#13;
area;&#13;
o  cost of seed production and expected production;&#13;
o  proposals on how the produced stock seed will be marketed and expected sales&#13;
revenue;&#13;
o  proposals on origin of foundation seed,&#13;
3.20  The stock seed to be produced at these centers would be sold to seed farmers who&#13;
would multiply them for sale to other farmers or for their own use. The seed to be&#13;
produced at these centers would cover the major crops such as paddy, soybean, peanuts,&#13;
maize and mungbeans depending on farmers' demand.&#13;
3.21   Training, Workshops and Seminars. The project would support training in&#13;
management, organization, planning and technical activities for extension workers,&#13;
technical and other project staff. Training programs would include: (a) project&#13;
orientation and mid-term review workshops as well as training of provincial, Kabupaten&#13;
and field level staff on project and financial management, program planning, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, gender sensitivity, environmental management, and community-based&#13;
development planning and implementation; (b) special leadership and organizational&#13;
training programs for farmers and village leaders on community-based development&#13;
activities, planning and farmer organization; and (c) continuous training of field level&#13;
extension staff on technical themes. The training program will also focus on helping field&#13;
extension workers identify technologies and agricultural production systems targeted for&#13;
women and the youth. To allow the extension and technical staff to do this, the project&#13;
will provide particular gender sensitivity training (in terms of the roles of different&#13;
household members) to project staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3.22 Technical Assistance. The project would finance:&#13;
(a)   about 350 staff-months of local consultancy support for various activities,&#13;
including: program coordinator (48 staff-months); area development&#13;
specialist (96 staff-months), rural engineer/contracts expert (30 staff-&#13;
months), training (36 staff-months), financial management/accountancy&#13;
(120 staff-months), periodic rapid rural appraisal and evaluation and other&#13;
short-term studies (20 staff-months); and&#13;
(b)   some short-term assistance open to international recruitment for:&#13;
developing a training program (18 staff-months); regional&#13;
development/project management (6 staff-months); establishment of an&#13;
M&amp;E system (6 staff-months); an initial baseline survey of income and&#13;
production information (12 staff-months); a mid-term review, and an&#13;
evaluation of development impact at project completion.&#13;
3.23  The findings and recommendations coming out of the mid-term review would be&#13;
issued in Bahasa Indonesia with a summary in English. Assurances were obtained from&#13;
GOI during negotiations that: (a) the baseline survey will be completed before March 31,&#13;
1997; and (b) the following consultants: civil works/contracts specialist, trainer, and&#13;
accountants would be appointed by August 31, 1996.&#13;
3.24 Operating Means and Supplies. The project provides for financing a vehicle per&#13;
each involved DINAS, 6 motorcycles per Kecamatan, office equipment and supplies for&#13;
field services of the Dinas, extension staff, community development, and supervisory staff.&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs including honoraria, staff allowances, operations and&#13;
maintenance costs, project coordination and management, at the national, provincial,&#13;
Kabupaten and kecamatan have also been included in the cost of the project and would be&#13;
financed by the Bank on a declining scale.&#13;
3.25  The Implementation Schedules for activities under the Capacity Strengthening and&#13;
Project Management Component are in Annex 7 Table 2 &amp; 3.&#13;
Component C. Farming Systems and Fisheries Research (US$ 1.6 million; 5 percent&#13;
of total base costs).&#13;
3.26  This component aims at supporting and extending the on-farm trial program of the&#13;
two regional Assessment Institutes of Agricultural Technology (AIAT) established by&#13;
AARD in Biromaru and Kendari. The main activities of the AIATs, according to the new&#13;
orientation adopted by AARD for national agricultural research will be related to:&#13;
* regional problem identification through better research-extension-farmer&#13;
linkages;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
*  closer collaboration between research and extension to generate and package&#13;
technologies to meet local farmers' needs;&#13;
*  technology transfer which would link researchers, extension workers and&#13;
farmers closer together;&#13;
*  organization of field days; and&#13;
*  production of materials and information which meet and recognize the&#13;
absorptive capacity and educational level of the farmers.&#13;
3.27  Most of the above activities will be carried out under the ARM II Project. The&#13;
financing will however be limited to a few sites and programs since available funding for&#13;
each AIAT under ARMP II will have to cover two provinces. In order to get a much&#13;
wider coverage of the project zones, financing will be provided under this component to&#13;
carry out various applied research programs, including post-harvest research, and fisheries&#13;
research in the two provinces, not covered under the research program being financed by&#13;
ARMP II. In addition to their own programs under ARMP II therefore, both AIATs will&#13;
support the SAAD project in certain areas of development in the two provinces. They will&#13;
support the project in three main areas:&#13;
(a) assist the Dinas-Dinas Food, Estate Crops, Livestock and Fisheries extension&#13;
agents in the transfer of proven agricultural technologies and in the design of&#13;
the most relevant agro-technological demonstrations on farmers fields as&#13;
funded under the project; The Dinas-Dinas extension agents will remain&#13;
responsible for the actual organization, lay-out and monitoring of the&#13;
demonstrations and organize farmer group discussion meetings. They will&#13;
ensure that women are involved in on-farm trials and field days, technology&#13;
testing and demonstrations, and other project support activities,&#13;
(b) carry out specific applied, priority research projects in support of regional&#13;
agricultural development and based on identified local specific needs; for this&#13;
the project provides 6 years of program funding; and&#13;
(c) establish, with the assistance of DGEC, new superior mother tree stock&#13;
gardens for cashew (Kendari) and cacao (Biromaru), 5 ha each, estimated at&#13;
RP 61 million/ garden.&#13;
3.28   One of the first AIAT activities programmed under the ARMP 2 is a Farming&#13;
Systems Research baseline survey to help identify the main applied research needs and to&#13;
help program farming systems including fisheries research and technology transfer&#13;
activities for the AIATs zones of coverage. In order to fully exploit the results of the FSR&#13;
survey, two extra man months for the FSR specialist would be paid for under the SAADP&#13;
to review the initial results of the baseline surveys in both provinces and organize two&#13;
regional research workshops to be attended by staff of the AIAT, the agricultural technical&#13;
agencies, the local planning agencies, and farmer representatives. The specific applied&#13;
priority research program in support of regional agricultural development mentioned in (b)&#13;
above will be determined at these workshops. Annex 2 gives details of the activities under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
the applied research program and the Implementation Schedule for the component is in&#13;
Annex 7 Table 4.&#13;
Status of Preparation and Implementation Schedule&#13;
(a) 3.29    The project was prepared by the Directorate General for Regional&#13;
and Area Development in the Department of Home Affairs with the assistance&#13;
of consultants. The preparation team had several discussions with the intended&#13;
beneficiaries and local authorities in all selected Kabupaten before settling on&#13;
the project components. A draft preparation report was issued in April 1995, a&#13;
Project Implementation Plan in July 1995, and a Social Assessment Report&#13;
issued in October 1995. These three documents formed the basis for the&#13;
appraisal by the Bank. The project implementation schedule based on the&#13;
above is at Annex 7&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
4.1    Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$42.6 million of which&#13;
US$6.2 million in foreign exchange and US$1.7 million in duties and taxes. Base costs are&#13;
expressed in October 1995 prices. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10 percent for&#13;
civil works, equipment and vehicles and 5 percent for agricultural inputs, breeding&#13;
animals, and research. Price contingencies are based on an estimated annual local inflation&#13;
rate of 8.7 percent and a foreign inflation rate of 2.4 percent from FY96. Project costs are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.1 below and detailed in Annex 4.&#13;

Kabupaten) would finance US$12.1 million equivalent (28.4 percent of project cost) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
the balance of US$3.7 million equivalent (8.6 percent of project cost) would be financed&#13;
by the beneficiaries contributing their labor for the demonstration and replication activities.&#13;

/a About 69 percent of project cost, exclusive of taxes, duties, vehicles and fertilizers&#13;
which GOI would finance.&#13;
Financing of Proposed Development Activities and Cost Recovery&#13;
4.3    The project would finance several crop development demonstration activities&#13;
covering irrigation, dryland farming, treecrop rehabilitation, and homegarden&#13;
improvement. All labor for demonstration activities and crop replication in the different&#13;
types of activities as well as labor for village infrastructure works will be supplied by&#13;
farmers. Annual inputs for irrigated cropping demonstrations, including farm tools,&#13;
improved seeds and fertilizers, would be supplied for two cropping cycles as grants to the&#13;
farmers participating in the demonstration programs. This subsidy is justified as these early&#13;
adopters would provide a demonstration effect for follower adopters.'3 There would be&#13;
one 2 ha demonstration per irrigation scheme with total area of demonstrations covering&#13;
about six percent of the targeted area of selected village irrigation schemes. Support will&#13;
also be provided for farmer seed growers to multiply improved seeds for sale to other&#13;
farmers, so as to initiate the introduction of improved varieties. Funds would be provided&#13;
through a village revolving credit scheme (para 4.6) for farmers who may want to replicate&#13;
the demonstration programs to purchase inputs. This one time grant to villages would&#13;
become a sustainable source of seasonal funding for farmers who would repay to their&#13;
communities at real and positive interest rates.&#13;
4.4    For dryland cropping the project would supply farm tools, fertilizers and other&#13;
required inputs for establishing demonstration farms and assistance for establishing tree&#13;
crop nurseries and for producing improved food crop seeds. Again the subsidy involved in&#13;
13 In economic language: these early adopters confer an extemality for follower adopters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
demonstration is justified due to the externality they generate for follower farmers. Those&#13;
who will want to replicate the dryland farming program may do so through the village&#13;
revolving credit scheme (para 4.6). There will be a one 3 ha demonstration farm for each 2&#13;
villages. Support for the demonstration and seed/seedling production programs will be for&#13;
two years. For houseplot cropping, arrangements would be similar as for dryland&#13;
cropping. There will be 2 demonstrations per village, each equivalent to about 0.2 ha.&#13;
Farmers' contribution will be in the form of labor for the demonstration activities.&#13;
4.5   For cattle raising the project would supply breeding stock to selected farmers&#13;
who: have developed or are already using sustainable farm practices; have not owned&#13;
livestock before; followed all the training; agree to develop the needed fencing and&#13;
stables; and have enough fodder crops planted to feed two animals year around. Priority&#13;
will also be given to farmers with a farm income below the average for the kecamatan.&#13;
Participating farmers would contract to return 2 heifers (1.5 years old) per cow received&#13;
(farmers who received a bull and a cow pay 3 heifers). Beneficiaries of the cattle&#13;
distribution program would return the second and third born calves for redistribution&#13;
among other interested farmers or for sale (usually the male calves) to cover part of the&#13;
operating cost of the livestock support services. An assurance to this effect was obtained&#13;
during negotiations. Management of the distribution and the cattle revolving credit&#13;
programs would be by the beneficiary communities (para 3.12 and Annex 1 Section G).&#13;
4.6   Inputs for Replication and Village-Level Revolving Credit. Though various&#13;
productivity improvement programs, financed by the Government, provide some means of&#13;
purchasing some agricultural inputs, direct farmer access to credit for input purchase is&#13;
often difficult. The commercial banking system has not shown much interest in managing&#13;
direct farmer credits and hence the project cannot rely on them to finance credits for&#13;
inputs. Project funds will be used to pay for inputs and even though the funds will be&#13;
passed on as a grant to the village farmers will be required to pay back the value of the&#13;
inputs, including interest, to the village to set up a village revolving credit. The credit will&#13;
not finance labor for replication since this is expected to be provided by the farmers.&#13;
Promising experiments are currently underway in Indonesia under the Yogyakarta Upland&#13;
Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND) and the Integrated Swamps Development&#13;
Project (Loan 3755-IND) with farmer-managed revolving credit schemes. The proposed&#13;
project would therefore finance a similar scheme that would make funds available to&#13;
farmer groups for input purchase.&#13;
4.7   It is expected that community development facilitators (CDFs) and extension&#13;
agents (PPLs) would help farmers to organize themselves into farmer groups and help&#13;
them prepare proposals for replication of project-introduced technology that would be&#13;
reviewed by the appropriate Dinas for inclusion in the annual program and financing plan.&#13;
Terms of reference of the CDFs is in Annex I Appendix A. Funds will be a one-time grant&#13;
to participating villages, but farmer groups and individual farmers would have to repay the&#13;
credit with a minimum interest rate of 15 percent per year in the initial years and a higher&#13;
rate in the latter years. Individual communities will however be able to charge higher rates&#13;
if they wish. Management of the credit will be by a village credit committee that will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
decide on credit terms, and ensure repayments. Details on operating conditions for the&#13;
credit were discussed at negotiations and are in Annex 1. Section I.&#13;
4.8   Each participating village would receive a revolving credit that would not exceed&#13;
Rp 10 million/year for distribution to farmer groups in the village. Repayments may be&#13;
given in priority to new farmers willing to adopt the package in the same village. Peer&#13;
pressure within the village setting is expected to lead to high rates of reimbursement as is&#13;
the case under the Hamlet Credit program of the Yogya Upland Agriculture Development&#13;
Project. In addition it is proposed that as part of the process of ensuring full repayment,&#13;
villages with farmer groups having overdue loans may not be provided further grants.&#13;
Over time, other farmers may either become members of already existing groups, or form&#13;
new groups. As experience with grassroots credit schemes under this and other projects&#13;
evolves, the training of facilitators would be updated and new formats would be&#13;
introduced. Assurance was obtained at negotiations that operation of the village grant and&#13;
revolving credit program would be under agreed conditions. Details on the operating&#13;
conditions under the village revolving credit scheme including regulations, operational&#13;
guidelines, and credit conditions for the revolving credit system (Annex 1 Section l) were&#13;
discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.9    General. Goods and works would be procured in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of the "Guidelines for the Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published by&#13;
the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Procurement under the project&#13;
would be undertaken by the respective implementing units under the guidance and control&#13;
of provincial and/or national parent agencies. Bulking and grouping of contracts across&#13;
agencies or provinces would not be practical and has therefore not been adopted. GOI&#13;
would finance purchases of vehicles and fertilizer (urea, TSP. and KCL) from its own&#13;
resources because under GOI procurement rules these items are not open for international&#13;
competitive bidding. Farmers may however use funds from the grant component for&#13;
financing replication inputs to purchase fertilizers. This component will be financed at 70&#13;
percent to take account of the fact that the share of fertilizer in the inputs to be purchased&#13;
is about 30 percent to be financed by Government. Procurement of vehicles would be in&#13;
accordance with a schedule and timetable agreed with the Bank. An assurance to this&#13;
effect was obtained from GOI during negotiations&#13;
4.10  Civil Works. Contracts for the rehabilitation of agricultural extension centers,&#13;
seed farms, and animal health posts (US$0.7 million) are expected to be relatively small&#13;
and would be widely dispersed over the two provinces. The major part (US$0.6 million)&#13;
would therefore be procured by national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. A small part of such contracts (US$0.1 million ) would involve&#13;
very minor works dispersed over time and space and may, with the Bank's prior&#13;
agreement, be procured on force account. Contracts for roads, bridges and culverts&#13;
(US$10.8 million) would normally be small, costing less than $50,000 each and would be&#13;
procured using simplified procurement procedures similar to national shopping. Under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
this procedure, small works up to the aggregate amount of US$10.8 million would be&#13;
procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations&#13;
obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The&#13;
invitation would include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications,&#13;
the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and&#13;
relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who&#13;
offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and&#13;
resources to complete the contract successfully.&#13;
4.11   Equipment and Agricultural Inputs. Equipment and furniture for extension,&#13;
seed production and animal health facilities (US$0.2 million), most agricultural inputs in&#13;
the form of pesticides, tools, some bulk veterinary supplies (US$1 .1 million) would be&#13;
procured by NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. The remaining agricultural inputs&#13;
(mainly planting material and some veterinary medicine) will be procured by national&#13;
shopping for packages costing less than US$50,000 equivalent, with an aggregate value&#13;
not to exceed US$1.0 million. For the procurement of breeding animals, it is expected&#13;
that a number of farmer groups would want to shop locally for their breeding animals&#13;
while others may want the assistance of the project to procure the animals. It is proposed&#13;
therefore that contracts costing less than US$30,000 up to a maximum amount of US$1.6&#13;
million may be acquired through national shopping. The other half of breeding animals&#13;
(US$1.5 million) will be procured by NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Grants will&#13;
be given to villages to purchase replication inputs and for agricultural marketing and&#13;
processing. Contracts for these will normally be entered into by individual farmer groups&#13;
in packages of less than $10,000 at a time, and therefore national shopping procedures will&#13;
be used for the purchase of replication inputs and for marketing and processing financed&#13;
under the grant component up to the aggregate amount of US$6.3 million.&#13;
4.12  Other Procurement. Consultant services (US$ 4.5 million), including contracts&#13;
to be signed with CDOs (US$1.9 million) would be contracted according to procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Separate contracts would be let by AARD for consultants&#13;
providing support to research (US$0.1 million) and by BANGDA and/or the provincial&#13;
BAPPEDAs for consultant services for strengthening of agricultural support services and&#13;
project administration (US$2.6 million). All consultants would be selected in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, August 1981, and engaged&#13;
according to the Bank's Standard form of Contract for Consultant Services, June 1995.&#13;
Contracts for CDOs would be treated as consulting services except that it would be by&#13;
sole source selection with CDOs under conditions acceptable to the Bank (para 5.10).&#13;
Sole source selection of CDOs would be necessary since there are only very few CDOs&#13;
operating in the project provinces with the requisite experience, staffing and language&#13;
capability to provide the community development services being asked for. Training&#13;
(US$0.9 million), mapping (US$0.4 million), and research (US$1.1 million) would be&#13;
carried out in accordance with the above guidelines. Procurement for activities listed&#13;
under the community development sub-component (US$2.7 million), that have yet to be&#13;
identified, would in general follow national shopping procedures for goods and small&#13;
works contracts for civil works.&#13;

4.14 Review of Procurement. The Bank would make a prior review of all documents&#13;
related to the award of: (a) all contracts US$100,000 equivalent or more for civil works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
and goods; (b) the first contract for civil works in Central and Southeast Sulawesi of less&#13;
than US$100,000; (c) the first contract for goods in Central and Southeast Sulawesi of&#13;
less than US$100,000; and (d) all contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
consultants' services by firms and all contracts of US$50,000 equivalent or more for&#13;
consultants' services by individuals. Due to the repetitive nature of small contracts,&#13;
characteristic for this type of project, prior review is expected to cover only about 50&#13;
percent by value of all civil works construction and supply of goods contracts. For&#13;
consultant contracts, the review would include terms of reference, shortlist, letters of&#13;
invitation, recommendation for award, and final contract. The exceptions to prior Bank&#13;
review of contracts for consultants' services would not apply to: (a) the terms of reference&#13;
for such contracts; (b) single-source selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a&#13;
critical nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to US$ 100,000 equivalent or&#13;
more; or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants raising&#13;
the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent or more. The Bank would review all other&#13;
procurement ex-post and at random.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
4.15  All activities under the project are expected to be completed by December 31,&#13;
2002 and the Loan closing date would be June 30, 2003. Disbursements from the Loan&#13;
would be made for:&#13;
(a)    65 percent of expenditures on civil works;&#13;
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment&#13;
and fjrniture, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex factory) for locally&#13;
manufactured items, and 65 percent of expenditures on locally procured&#13;
items;&#13;
(c)    90 percent of expenditures on consultant services, surveys and mapping,&#13;
training courses, and agricultural inputs (except fertilizers) for&#13;
demonstration and seed farms, breeding animals, and research trials and&#13;
demonstrations;&#13;
(d)   70 percent of expenditures for grants to villages for acquisition of&#13;
replication inputs and agricultural processing and marketing and for&#13;
services, works, and equipment procured under the "other local community&#13;
initiatives" sub-component; and&#13;
(e)    60 percent of incremental operating cost for expenditures incurred in&#13;
FY97 and FY98, 50 percent of expenditures incurred in FY99 and FY00,&#13;
and 40 percent of expenditures incurred in FY01 and thereafter.&#13;
Annex 5 Table 2 gives the proposed allocation of the Loan by Category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4.16  Disbursements under the project would be made against Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOE) for:&#13;
(a)   contracts for works, goods (including agricultural inputs and breeding&#13;
animals) valued at less than US$100,000, except for the first contract for&#13;
goods and for works in Sulawesi Tengah and Sulawesi Tenggara,&#13;
(b)   contracts for the employment of consultants valued at less than&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals; and&#13;
(c)   expenditures for survey, design and mapping, replication inputs, training,&#13;
research and development expenditures, local community initiatives, and&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;
4.17  Disbursements from the Loan for the following contracts would be made against&#13;
full documentation: (a) works and goods contracts (including agricultural inputs, breeding&#13;
animals, and local community initiatives) and consultant services by firms valued at or&#13;
more than US$100,000; and consultant services contracts with individual consultants&#13;
valued at more than US$50,000. All other disbursements would be made against&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOE) for which relevant documents would be retained by&#13;
responsible project implementing agencies and the Directorate General of Budget&#13;
(Ministry of Finance) and be made available for inspection by Bank supervision mission.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.18  In order to facilitate disbursements, the Government would establish a Special&#13;
Account in the amount of US$2.5 million (equivalent to the average disbursements during&#13;
a four-month period) in Bank Indonesia. This account should be maintained by the&#13;
Directorate General of Budget, MOF. All disbursements from the Bank loan would be&#13;
made through the Special Account. Replenishment applications to the Special Account&#13;
will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the SA balance has been used,&#13;
whichever comes first.&#13;
4.19  Each project executing agency would establish and maintain adequate and separate&#13;
accounts from the beginning of project implementation, including accounts relating to the&#13;
cattle distribution program. To facilitate audit of project accounts, BANGDA (the project&#13;
lead agency) would collect and consolidate account records of all implementing agencies&#13;
into a single document. Assurances were received from GOI during negotiations that: (a)&#13;
all project accounts, including schedules of expenditures claimed under SOE procedures&#13;
and usage of the Special Account, would be audited annually by the Government Audit&#13;
Agency (BPKP), or other suitably qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (b) audit&#13;
reports of project accounts, SOE and Special Account would be furnished to the Bank&#13;
within nine months of the close of each Government fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
5. ORGANIZATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND&#13;
MONITORING&#13;
Organizational Structure&#13;
5.1   The proposed project would be implemented in a decentralized, multi-sectoral&#13;
manner with primary responsibility for project implementation at the Kabupaten and lower&#13;
levels, for purposes of ensuring ownership of the project of the local Governments and the&#13;
rural population. Organizational arrangements are shown in Chart 1. Project managers&#13;
would mostly be at the Kabupaten level (TK II). This decentralized project implementation&#13;
approach will ensure that the two principal project components; the agriculture-based area&#13;
development, and capacity strengthening, will be directly implemented by the local&#13;
governments.&#13;
5.2   At the national level, a Central Guidance committee (CGC) chaired by&#13;
BAPPENAS (Deputy V Regional Development) and including, among others,&#13;
representatives from the Ministries of Home Affairs (DG Regional Development, and&#13;
Director Area Development), Finance and Agriculture (DGFCH, DGLS, DGE, DG&#13;
Fisheries, and DG AARD) will be responsible for providing policy guidance and&#13;
coordination, for reviewing project progress, and resolving issues on overall Loan&#13;
administration. To provide support for the CGC and to coordinate project activities, a&#13;
small project secretariat will be set up at the Directorate of Area Development in&#13;
BANGDA. This unit is expected to maintain close liaison with the Directorate Generals of&#13;
Food Crops, Estate Crops, Livestock and Fisheries, all of the Ministry of Agriculture, to&#13;
ensure that appropriate technical support from the sector agencies can be given to the&#13;
provinces and Kabupatens when necessary. The project secretariat will ensure that the&#13;
above four DGs participate at least twice a year in project supervision. The main activities&#13;
of the unit will be:&#13;
(a)   to coordinate project planning and budgeting at the national and provincial&#13;
levels;&#13;
(b)   to review annual work plans and budgets and process the Decision Letter&#13;
for Budget Assistance (SPABP) for the provinces;&#13;
(c)   to monitor and evaluate project implementation and impact;&#13;
(d)   to prepare periodic project progress reports (annual/semi-annual);&#13;
(e)   to implement national level activities such as project orientation&#13;
workshops, coordination, recruitment of consultants, etc.; and&#13;
(f)   to liaise with the Bank, administer loan disbursements and consolidate&#13;
project accounts from the provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.3   At the provincial level, a Provincial Coordination Committee (PCC) chaired by&#13;
the BAPPEDA I Chairman would be responsible for coordination, planning, supervision,&#13;
monitoring, and technical support of project activities. The committee would include the&#13;
Agriculture Kanwil, and the Dinas-Dinas of agriculture, public works, as well as&#13;
community development. The provincial environmental bureau (BKLH) will also be part&#13;
of the committee to ensure that all project activities conform to acceptable environmental&#13;
standards. A project secretariat, headed by the chief of the Economic Division of&#13;
Bappeda, will be appointed to coordinate and implement any activities at the provincial&#13;
level. The functions of the secretariat would be similar to those of the national project&#13;
secretariat and would include:&#13;
(a)   ensuring province-wide coordination of all project activities;&#13;
(b)   reviewing for approval by the PCC, the Kabupaten activities, annual work&#13;
plans and budgets;&#13;
(c)   monitoring and evaluating implementation and preparing progress reports;&#13;
(d)   preparing loan disbursement applications for Components A and B;&#13;
(e)   carrying out provincial level activities; and&#13;
(f)   liaising with central Government agencies, Kabupaten, and the Bank.&#13;
5.4   For each of the Kabupaten (TK I) levels, a project coordinator will be appointed&#13;
at the Bappeda TK 11, with project managers (PIMPROs) appointed at each of the&#13;
participating Dinas-Dinas. . An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
coordinators and project managers will be appointed by August 31, 1996 and will be&#13;
provided with competent staff in adequate numbers. The PIMPROs will be responsible&#13;
for the implementation of the field activities working with a team at the district level and&#13;
with Kecamatan level teams. The latter would constitute the basic unit for local level&#13;
planning, project implementation and organization of community participation.&#13;
5.5   Though the applied research component (C) is expected to be implemented by the&#13;
AIATs, consistent with arrangements adopted under the ARM II project, each AIAT&#13;
would establish a Regional Advisory Committee (RAC) and a Regional Technical&#13;
Working Group (RTWG) in each province to provide guidance for AIAT during project&#13;
implementation. Each RAC would be chaired by the head of each provincial BAPPEDA as&#13;
first chair with the head of MOAs regional coordinating office (Kanwil) as second chair.&#13;
Members of the RAC would be drawn from various Dinas-Dinas, local universities, research&#13;
institutes, farmers' groups, local CDOs and private sector. The RAC guides the AIAT and its&#13;
Director on the R&amp;D program, priorities and policies. The RTWG would be chaired by the&#13;
AIAT Director with representation from various regional and provincial agencies. AARD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
will designate officers at CASER and CARP (Center for Agricultural Research Program)&#13;
to liaise with the Project Secretariat and the Bank.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
5.6   The approach for implementing the Agriculture Development Component has&#13;
been formulated to maximize the participation of the targeted beneficiaries in selecting,&#13;
planning and implementing the project interventions. Project activities would be planned&#13;
through the existing bottom-up planning system with field extension workers (FEW) and&#13;
community development facilitators (CDF) assisting rural communities in planning of&#13;
project activities. The facilitators, to be recruited on contract by the project, may be&#13;
recruited locally, from universities, or from among CDOs. They, together with the FEW&#13;
and other community development staff, would help farmers and farmer groups:&#13;
(a) to identify their main constraints and priority needs;&#13;
(b) to review the menu of activities and select the most appropriate option&#13;
provided by the project that is needed in their village based on the natural&#13;
conditions and comparative advantage of the area;&#13;
(c) to prepare a request and submit this request through the bottom-up planning&#13;
process for financing;&#13;
(d) to prepare and implement the agreed on activity including management of any&#13;
village level revolving credit that the group may ask for; and&#13;
(e) to monitor, evaluate and make mid-course corrections in project&#13;
implementation as necessary&#13;
5.7   The village level proposals would be reviewed and consolidated at the Kecamatan&#13;
level and retained proposals will be sent to the Kabupaten level. The Kabupaten project&#13;
staff will review all project proposals and prepare a draft annual operational plan and&#13;
budget for onward transmission to the provincial level steering committee for review and&#13;
adoption.&#13;
5.8   Apart from the options provided through the identified menu of activities, rural&#13;
communities and local CDOs would also be encouraged to identify other priorities, not&#13;
included in the core menu, for development in their communities and prepare proposals for&#13;
assistance under a community development fund included as part of the project. Under&#13;
this program, the CDFs and FEWs will assist farmers, farmer groups and/or village&#13;
communities to identify activities and make proposals for funding. The village level&#13;
proposals, formulated by farmer groups and/or villages with assistance from the community&#13;
development facilitators, will be consolidated at the Kecamatan level and reviewed for funding&#13;
as described in para 3.15 and Annex 1 Section H.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
5.9   Given the limited capacity existing at the local levels to manage and teach&#13;
community-based development, it is proposed that the project finance community&#13;
development facilitators to strengthen the current local government structure. A special&#13;
effort would be made to work with institutions familiar with participatory development&#13;
and to train local officials in community development approaches. In addition during the&#13;
early years of the proposed project, assistance would be provided to strengthen local&#13;
capacity to carry out this approach through short-term training in community based&#13;
planning for community leaders and technical agencies at the kecamatan and village levels.&#13;
5.10  During negotiations, the GOI Delegation expressed the view that some effort&#13;
should be made in the project to foster the growth of grassroots community development&#13;
organizations (CDOs). The Delegation however indicated that in the two provinces, there&#13;
may not be grassroots CDOs that currently have the personnel or experience to be able to&#13;
provide the entire services required in the project over a large geographical area. It was&#13;
therefore agreed that more experienced CDOs (national or international) should be paired&#13;
up with local CDOs to ensure that the local organizations get the exposure, training and&#13;
management assistance that they require in providing support to the village and farmer&#13;
groups.&#13;
5.11  Procedures and Criteria for Selecting CDOs. It was agreed during negotiations&#13;
that, to the extent possible, one local CDO will be selected per Kabupaten while a more&#13;
experienced CDO will be selected per province to enter into partnership with those&#13;
selected per Kabupaten (the same experienced CDO can however be selected for the two&#13;
provinces). In accordance with the requirements under the Bank's Consultant Guidelines,&#13;
the following criteria and procedures for selection were agreed:&#13;
*  the experienced CDO together with the local CDO will agree on the community&#13;
development facilitators (CDF) for each Kabupaten (terms of reference set out in&#13;
Attachment 3);&#13;
*  there will be I or 2 CDFs per Kecamatan depending on the number of villages;&#13;
*  the CDOs will provide a community development coordinator (CDC - terms of&#13;
reference in Attachment 3) and a gender/youth coordinator at the Kabupaten level;&#13;
*  the involvement of CDOs will be by invitation;&#13;
*  for each Kabupaten, the Bappeda Tk II will invite proposals from at least three local&#13;
CDOs that can work in the Kabupaten. These CDOs will make proposals on how they&#13;
will provide support to the community development program of the project. For the&#13;
CDO at the provincial level, the Bappeda Tk I will invite proposals from two or three&#13;
national or international CDOs with experience in the province. The form of the&#13;
proposals is included in Attachment 3;&#13;
*  Bappeda Tk II will review the proposals and select the CDO providing the best&#13;
proposal for the Kabupaten. Bappeda Tk I will review the selection to ensure that the&#13;
selected CDO meets the agreed selection criteria;&#13;
*  the selection of the provincial level CDO will be made by Bappeda Tk I based on the&#13;
review of the proposals and after discussion with Bappeda Tk II; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
the proposed CDO team for each province will be forwarded to the project secretariat&#13;
at the national level and to the Bank, with the criteria used for their selection.&#13;
5.12 For the Project Management and Capacity Strengthening Component, all&#13;
training for field, sub-district, district staff would take place in the target area or in the&#13;
Kabupaten or Kecamatan headquarters and would be organized by the project trainer in&#13;
consultation with the concerned staff. Arrangements for the acquisition of vehicles and&#13;
equipment will be made at the provincial level to permit regrouping.&#13;
5.13  For the Research Component, annual research plans and on-farm demonstration&#13;
programs would be prepared following procedures set up for the AIATs as part of the&#13;
ARMP II and as described in Annex 2. Each annual research plan would be reviewed by&#13;
the Technical Working Groups and approved by the Advisory Committees. The&#13;
approved work plan and budgets for the two provinces would be incorporated in the work&#13;
program for each province and furnised to CARP through CASER for DIP counterpart&#13;
funding. Trials and demonstrations funded under the proposed project would be carried&#13;
out in farmers' fields. AIAT staff would, together with Dinas staff, would design and&#13;
select the sites for all trials and demonstrations and would ensure adequate coverage of all&#13;
project areas. Field staff of the respective Dinas TK. II and village extension staff on site&#13;
would ensure the day-to-day management of the trials and demonstrations.&#13;
Budget Procedures&#13;
5.14  Project activities would be financed in accordance with existing GOI procedures&#13;
for financing Bank-assisted projects. Counterpart funds for project activities would be&#13;
provided under the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture for Component C. Funds for&#13;
Components B and C would be from "On-Top" funds financed through the budget of&#13;
the Ministry of Home Affairs and from the provincial and Kabupaten development budgets&#13;
(APBD TK I and TK II). Budget allocations for project activities would be based on&#13;
consolidated annual work programs agreed among project implementation agencies and&#13;
BAPPEDA at the provincial level. The budgeting process under the proposed project&#13;
would comprise the following steps:&#13;
(a)   the provincial BAPPEDAs would review the work programs proposed at&#13;
local levels and as described in para 3.15 and prepare consolidated&#13;
provincial work plans and draft budgets;&#13;
(b)   the provincial work plans and draft budgets would be sent to the National&#13;
Project Secretariat for review and consolidation and thereafter submitted to&#13;
BAPPENAS, AARD, MoHA and the provincial and Kabupaten authorities&#13;
in August of each year for incorporation in their annual budget proposals;&#13;
(c)   the consolidated work plans and cost estimates would be forwarded to the&#13;
Bank by October 31 of each year for review; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
(d)   the final budget proposals based on the agreed work plan would be&#13;
forwarded to the Bank before December 31 of each project year.&#13;
5.15  To ensure that adequate funds would be provided for planned project activities,&#13;
assurances were obtained from GOI at negotiations that GOI would furnish to the Bank&#13;
for its review and comments: (a) not later than October 31 each year, a consolidated work&#13;
program and cost estimates for the following fiscal year; and (b) by December 31 each&#13;
year, coordinated budget proposals for the provincial work programs agreed with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation and Performance Indicators&#13;
5.16  Given the scale of community-based activities and the decentralized project&#13;
management structure proposed for the project, close monitoring will be an essential&#13;
feature of the project to permit continuous evaluation of project progress and to propose&#13;
measures to ensure effective and efficient implementation. The M&amp;E system would be&#13;
similar to that designed for the proposed Nusa Tenggara Area-based Agriculture&#13;
Development Project (NTAADP) and would include impact analysis for the main&#13;
agricultural activities: village irrigation, dryland farming, livestock distribution, and other&#13;
local community initiatives, in addition to the regular reports on financial and physical&#13;
progress. Participation of women and youth in the various project activities will be&#13;
monitored in the M&amp;E program.&#13;
5.17  The first level of monitoring reports would be from Kabupaten level PIMNPROs to&#13;
the Provincial Project Secretariat. These reports would be prepared quarterly and used to&#13;
respond immediately to any problems encountered in implementing the project activity and&#13;
also to elicit any technical help that may be necessary from the higher level technical&#13;
agencies (provincial or central). The quarterly reports would be discussed with Bank&#13;
Supervision missions. The second level of monitoring would be on the physical,&#13;
environmental and financial progress of the project through mandated reporting forms&#13;
from the implementing agencies varying according to the source of funding but updated at&#13;
least every semester. The third level would seek to provide simple quantitative feedback&#13;
on the performance of the project's major activities through impact indicators collected&#13;
regularly and updated yearly to provide a data base for evaluating the financial, economic&#13;
and social impact of project interventions on target beneficiaries. The fourth and final&#13;
method would be rapid appraisal monitoring. This method is recommended as: (a) a&#13;
means of direct interaction with the target population; and (b) a useful management tool to&#13;
achieve coordination among the implementing agencies. Rapid appraisal should be&#13;
conducted once a year at the Kabupaten level with representation from the Kabupaten&#13;
Dinas, kecamatan staff, participating CDOs and the provincial BAPPEDA office. A&#13;
consultant will be financed in each of the two provinces to set up and manage the&#13;
monitoring process.&#13;
5.18  The proposed evaluation system has been designed to evaluate project outcomes in&#13;
relation to the project objectives. A three tiered system would be used consisting of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
(a)   an initial inventory or data base on income and production information at&#13;
the provincial and Kabupaten levels, building on the data gathered during&#13;
project preparation;&#13;
(b)   a mid-term review after two years of project life to review progress,&#13;
identify management and technical constraints, assess development impact&#13;
and recommend adjustments in project design, as appropriate; and&#13;
(c)   a final review at project completion to evaluate the direct impact of the&#13;
project on target groups and the effectiveness of the organizational&#13;
structure and management system used in the project, and to draw&#13;
conclusions for future projects.&#13;
5.19  Details on the proposed project performance indicators are given in Table 5.1. This&#13;
is a comprehensive list discussed during negotiations which Government agreed to&#13;
monitor. It was however agreed that a few key indicators from the above list will be&#13;
selected during early supervision for close monitoring though Government indicated that&#13;
given the new approach in this project, it would like to monitor as many f the indicators as&#13;
possible.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
5.20  As the project is geographically dispersed and involves a novel approach to&#13;
providing services to the rural population, the Bank should schedule supervision missions&#13;
initially at least twice a year, starting off with two main project launch workshops in the&#13;
two provinces and mini workshops in each Kabupaten. In general, the fall supervision&#13;
missions will concentrate on the work programs and budgets for the following years and&#13;
the spring missions on the results achieved in the field during the preceding rainy season.&#13;
A mid-term review is also programmed for early 1999 even though each supervision&#13;
mission would review project progress and consider necessary adjustments. An assurance&#13;
was obtained from GOI during negotiations that a mid-term review report would be&#13;
furnished to the Bank by March 31, 1999, for review and discussion with GOI by May 31,&#13;
1999. The Bank would rely to the extent possible on the Bank's Resident Mission staff&#13;
(RSI) to interact continuously with the central and local project agencies and to undertake&#13;
quick field visits to provide implementation assistance as necessary. A supervision plan&#13;
for the project is at Annex 7. It details the mix of specialties and frequency and duration&#13;
of missions needed to ensure adequate supervision by the Bank. In addition, RSI would&#13;
conduct ex-post reviews of works completed and goods supplied at the rate of about two&#13;
staff-weeks per year.&#13;

6. PROJECT BENEFITS, AGRICULTURAL&#13;
PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARM INCOMES&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
6.1   The project would increase smallholder productivity and incomes, and raise the&#13;
capacity of the local government agencies and village institutions to provide agricultural&#13;
services to farmers and to promote community participation in development. The project,&#13;
together with others, would also support and supplement GOI's ongoing efforts to&#13;
improve the standards of living in the country's eastern islands and thus reduce regional&#13;
income disparities. The main benefits are categorized below (see Annex -, Table - for&#13;
further details):&#13;
(a) direct impact on target beneficiaries through increased agricultural&#13;
production and incomes, support for farming systems research, and improved&#13;
rural infrastructure, especially roads. Because of the dense network of&#13;
demonstration activities to be financed under the project, at least over 80&#13;
percent of the rural population (180,000 households) would be exposed to the&#13;
project's activities. Cumulatively, over 100,000 households (or about 45&#13;
percent of the households) would directly benefit from project financing for&#13;
either demonstration or replication of one or the other of the interventions&#13;
under Component A (irrigation, dryland farming, treecrop rehabilitation, cattle&#13;
distribution, and houseplot improvements, chicken vaccination, community&#13;
initiatives, etc.). The village revolving credit program as well the introduction&#13;
of better production technology generated by research (Component C),&#13;
improvement of agricultural support services, and redistribution of breeding&#13;
cattle, would further increase the number of beneficiaries beyond those&#13;
estimated above, after the project ends; and&#13;
(b) improved capacity of local planning and technical agencies to plan,&#13;
appraise, monitor and execute multi-sectoral development programs and to&#13;
correct program implementation whether the program is locally or externally&#13;
financed. Civil servants and local government staff from the two provinces&#13;
would receive short-term training and gain practical experience from the&#13;
project to plan better for future development, improve future utilization of&#13;
development resources and replicate the experience of the project in other&#13;
areas.&#13;
Agricultural Production&#13;
6.2   The impact of project activities on agricultural production has been analyzed based&#13;
on different farm models that represent the farming typologies of the two provinces. Two&#13;
farm model typologies were used for irrigated production, three for dryland farming, three&#13;
for house gardening and two for treecrop rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
6.3    Farm Models Analyses. The impact of the project on production in irrigated&#13;
agriculture have been based on two farm model types representing some 20,300 farms, at&#13;
full development, with an average size of 0.5 ha irrigated land on some 203 farmer-&#13;
managed village irrigation systems. For dryland agriculture, estimates are based on three&#13;
farm model types representing some 52,000 farms at full development (PYIO) with an&#13;
average size of 0.75 ha rainfed land. It has further been assumed that some 10 percent of&#13;
the irrigated farms and up to 50 percent of the dryland farms would take up livestock&#13;
keeping under the project by acquiring breeding cattle. Also, three farm model types&#13;
covering some 8,800 farm households were reviewed to analyze the expected to increase&#13;
in the production from home gardens.&#13;
6.4    Though assumptions underlying the farm models have been made as realistic as&#13;
possible, the selected models are obviously simplifications of diverse situations existing in&#13;
the field. Soil and water conditions in the project areas and cultural preferences of the&#13;
people are the determinant factors in the choice of farming systems. The selected models&#13;
obscure large variations in climatic conditions and productive potentials in the two&#13;
provinces, between different areas of the same province and within islands. Also, there&#13;
will be large differences in the time periods farmers will need to adopt improved&#13;
cultivation practices, in some cases continuing beyond the project horizon and&#13;
necessitating the making of assumptions for the purpose of quantifying project benefits.&#13;
The models however are derived from current cultivation practices in Southeast and&#13;
Central Sulawesi and capture the essentials of the prospects for improving agriculture in&#13;
the two provinces. Generally, a conservative stance has been maintained for the&#13;
projections of future production. Though full development is not expected until PYIO in&#13;
terms of areas replicated (adopted), we leveled off adoption in terms of area at PY7 for&#13;
purposes of our economic analysis.&#13;
6.5   Improvements in Productivity. Yield increases are assumed to derive from&#13;
farmers adopting improved water management and improved technology packages in the&#13;
form of higher yielding seed varieties, modern inputs and better cultural practices. The&#13;
following assumptions were made regarding productivity improvements under the project:&#13;
(a) In the village irrigation program the project will not finance any physical&#13;
improvements to the schemes (diversion weirs, field canals, etc.) since these are&#13;
already being made under GOI's ongoing Village Irrigation Improvement program&#13;
(PID). The latter program however will not finance any agricultural improvements on&#13;
completed schemes. The village irrigation model used here therefore assumes that the&#13;
present project would follow up on the infrastructure improvements with field&#13;
demonstrations and extension of improved production practices (HYV seeds,&#13;
fertilizers, etc.), organization of farmer and water user groups, plus financing (through&#13;
the village credit scheme) for replication. The project interventions are expected to&#13;
result in additional increases in the yields of the two main crops paddy (from an&#13;
estimated average 4.0 tons to 5.5 ton/ha) and soybeans (from 0.8 tons to 1.2 tons/ha).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Cropping intensity is assumed to increase from 1.0 to 1.10. A Table on the rate of&#13;
adoption of the technology is in Annex 1 Table 1.&#13;
(b) In the dryland production program, the crops currently produced (without project)&#13;
are upland rice and beans (mungbeans, soybeans, etc.) with a cropping intensity of&#13;
about 91 percent. The technology to be introduced under the project would permit&#13;
farmers to diversify into tree crops (mainly cashew, fruit trees), fodder/fuel trees, and&#13;
grass. Since the technology aims at helping farmers intensify their production and&#13;
become sedentary, the upland rice would be replaced in the rotation by maize. They&#13;
would also be encouraged to intensify food crop cultivation. Three farm model types&#13;
have been used (Annex I Table A3) and these models assumes an increase in average&#13;
cropping intensity to about 141 percent. This increase would occur gradually,&#13;
allowing sufficient time for farmers to test the recommended new practices. Maize&#13;
yields would increase from 1.5 to about 2.0 to 2.2 tons/ha for farmers who would&#13;
adopt the application of basic fertilizer dosages (Models 2 &amp; 3) but only about 1.6&#13;
ton/ha for those who would not (Model 1). Mungbean yields would increase from 600&#13;
to 700 kg (Model 1) or to 900 kg/ha (Models 2 &amp;3). Cashew trees would start&#13;
yielding 1 kg dry raw nuts/tree from year 6, increasing to about 7.5 kg nuts/tree by&#13;
year 11 (Model 2); the average farmer would have about 3 3 trees. A Table on the rate&#13;
of adoption of the dryland technology is in Annex 1 Table 2.&#13;
(c) In the Treecrop Rehabilitation program, there would be two basic types of activities:&#13;
rehabilitation of existing overgrown cashew (in general not shaded); and rehabilitation&#13;
of cacao farms (shaded by coconut or other trees or bananas). For cashew, it is&#13;
recommended to reduce the number of mature trees to some 33 trees/ha and plant&#13;
foodcrops in between, such as corn and mungbeans. Alternatively when high quality&#13;
cashew seedlings are available (about Year 5 or 6 of project), they could be planted to&#13;
replace the ones which have been cut out, which in turn will replace the oldest trees&#13;
after some 4 to 6 years. For purposes of our farm model analyses however, we have&#13;
used only the first approach (Annex I Table A4). For the cacao model (Annex 1&#13;
Table A5), it is recommended to apply proper pruning techniques to improve tree&#13;
shapes, fruit bearing, crop sanitation and ventilation and improve the quality of the&#13;
shade trees by planting lamtoro and gamal trees. For cacao, yields are estimated to&#13;
increase from 350 kg/ha in the without project situation to about 800kg/ha five years&#13;
after rehabilitation (starting from 250kg) and for cashew, yields are expected to go up&#13;
from 350 kg/ha to 700 kg/ha in Year 5 (starting from some 200kg/ha). In addition&#13;
the inter-cropped maize is expected to yield the equivalent of 1.8 tons/ha and&#13;
mungbeans about 700 kg/ha. A Table on the rate of adoption of the treecrop&#13;
rehabilitation technology is in Annex 1 Table 3&#13;
(d) The house garden model (Annex 1 Table A6) assumes that those adopting the&#13;
program would replace cassava cultivation with some beans/vegetables and also plant&#13;
mangoes, jackfruit, vanilla, ginger and lamtoro. Modest increases in food crops (maize&#13;
and beans) and treecrop production are expected from use of manure, cash inputs and&#13;
better cultivation practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
(e) For farmers receiving livestock, improved cattle feeding practices and better health&#13;
care are expected to (a) increase cattle birth rates from about 70 to 80 percent, and&#13;
(b) decrease mortality rates from 15 percent to 8 percent for animals under one year of&#13;
age and from 3 percent to 2 percent for animals over three years. For the poultry&#13;
vaccination program, in order to eliminate the problem posed by vaccines requiring&#13;
refrigeration, the project is to introduce a new technology of a heat resistant vaccine&#13;
(the V4 strain), now available in Indonesia. A community-based system relying on the&#13;
existing women network organizations, PKK, would be used to support the&#13;
vaccination program to control Newcastle disease among village chickens.&#13;
6.6   Incremental Production. Applying the assumptions in the farm model typologies&#13;
above to areas that can be covered in the project under proposals for demonstration and&#13;
replication activities, would lead to a direct project induced incremental annual production&#13;
at full development, equivalent to about 8,800 tons of paddy, 41,300 tons of maize,&#13;
12,300 tons of beans (soybeans and mungbeans), 2,960 tons of raw cashew nuts, 5,600&#13;
tons of cacao, about 1,000 tons of fruits and smaller production of vanilla and ginger.&#13;
The cattle distribution program and associated investments in animal health are expected&#13;
to add annually about 1,260 head of cattle (year 10). In practice the composition of&#13;
incremental production is likely to be far more diverse since farmers are essentially free to&#13;
cultivate what crops they want and for which there is demand. Crops that are likely to be&#13;
cultivated include coffee, different types of beans, more soybeans and fruit trees than&#13;
anticipated, and groundnuts. The value of the incremental production at full development&#13;
would be equivalent to over US$22.5 million per year (Annex 1 Table Al).&#13;
Farm Incomes.&#13;
6.7   Table 6.1 gives a summary of the expected farm incomes from the farm models&#13;
analyzed. Net farm incomes are expected to increase as a result of improvements to the&#13;
irrigated and dryland cropping systems, the treecrop rehabilitation program, cattle and&#13;
poultry keeping, and intensified home gardening - either separately or in combination. In&#13;
general therefore farmers adopting the proposed interventions are expected to obtain&#13;
substantial increases in net incomes, from their combined farming activities.&#13;

6.8    Farm incomes for three activity models are given in Table 6.1. The models show,&#13;
among others, that net income from 0.5 ha irrigated land would increase by about 50&#13;
percent over the without project situation to about US$508 equivalent when pre-project&#13;
infrastructure improvements are followed by better agricultural practices. Net incomes on&#13;
an 0.75 ha dryland farm are expected to increase substantially from US$135 to the&#13;
equivalent of an US$280 at full development (year 10) with the recommended intensive&#13;
cultivation of food and tree crops, and to about US$210 equivalent if farmers would&#13;
continue to use only modest quantities of fertilizers on their food crops. Under the&#13;
rehabilitation program, farmers can expect to double their net incomes from the equivalent&#13;
of US$230 to about US$470 by adopting the recommended package. Net income per&#13;
workday would increase by about 18 percent on irrigated and by about 10 to 50 percent&#13;
on dryland farms. Similarly incomes from home-gardens are expected to double from&#13;
about US$36 equivalent on a plot of 0.2 ha to over US$82 through the introduction of&#13;
high value crops such as fruit trees, vanilla and spices. Further details are given in Annex&#13;
1, Tables Al to A4&#13;
6.9    Farmers who keep cattle, in addition to practicing improved irrigated or dryland&#13;
cropping, would be able to supplement their net incomes. However, during the early years&#13;
cash returns from a project-supplied heifer would be irregular and far apart. Under the&#13;
project, farmers would be required to return the first calf to the project, keep the second&#13;
and return the third. The second calf would be born about three to four years after the&#13;
arrival of the original heifer and, if sold, would be worth about US$150 equivalent one&#13;
year later. Only from the sixth or seventh year onwards would the cattle keepers be able&#13;
to regularly sell (once per year with some luck) descendants from the original heifer or her&#13;
retained daughter(s). Animal keepers other than those receiving breeding stock from the&#13;
project also would benefit because of the improvements to the animal health facilities,&#13;
resulting in lower mortalities and higher calving rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

7. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION, IMPACT&#13;
ASSESSMENTS AND RISKS&#13;
Project Alternatives&#13;
7.1   Several alternative approaches to project design were considered during project&#13;
preparation, with the following being the key ones:&#13;
(a) Sector/centrally managed project. One main alternative approach to project&#13;
design would normally be a project designed centrally with components in the&#13;
provinces. In general however, these central-based sector projects have not&#13;
attempted to design operations to fit local constraints, but rather project areas&#13;
have been selected to fit project design. Such a central approach, for small&#13;
resource poor and remote provinces, such as those in the proposed project,&#13;
often leads to a general lack of balance in investments either between sectors&#13;
or between regions and little integration in programs. The regional approach&#13;
adopted here has allowed for a better local focus and review of the technical,&#13;
institutional, and incentive constraints of the project area and a project design&#13;
adapted to each area's conditions&#13;
(b) Regional coverage. Government's initial objective was to prepare one regional&#13;
development project covering at least seven provinces in the eastern islands&#13;
that it considered the poorest (Southeast and Central Sulawesi, East and West&#13;
Nusa Tenggara, East Timor, Maluku and Irian Jaya). In order to adapt project&#13;
design to specific regions and keep implementation and supervision&#13;
arrangements simple, the Bank and GOI eventually agreed to prepare separate&#13;
projects for the different areas. The Bank agreed to assist Government prepare&#13;
three of these projects covering one project for the two Nusa Tenggara&#13;
provinces, one for Maluku and the third for Central and Southeast Sulawesi.&#13;
Other donors (ADB and AUSAID) are helping Government with activities in&#13;
Irian Jaya and East Timor.&#13;
(c) Sector Coverage. Regional authorities were interested, during preparation, in&#13;
including activities from non-agricultural sectors. The Bank agreed with&#13;
Government that though other sector activities are important, implementation&#13;
experience of integrated rural development activities financed by the Bank has&#13;
shown that such projects are overly complex to manage and their poor&#13;
performance has been associated with project complexity and lack of flexibility.&#13;
The project scope was therefore limited to agriculture and associated&#13;
infrastructure development (roads), excluding sectors such as health care and&#13;
education. It was stressed however that though the project focus is on&#13;
agriculture, it is expected to complement other alternative non-agricultural&#13;
activities being financed by Government (e.g. through IDT), other donors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
(Bank in Kabupaten Roads, Water Supply, Education, urban infrastructure,&#13;
etc.) and private individuals in trade and processing,&#13;
(d) Project Components. Several proposed sub-components for agricultural area&#13;
development were dropped for various reasons. Land titling was not included&#13;
because on balance comprehensive national coverage reflecting national&#13;
priorities is preferred over fragmented regional coverage. Goat distribution&#13;
was dropped as a sub-component because a large number of IDT village&#13;
groups are already involved in goat distribution. Though construction of&#13;
village irrigation structures was included during preparation, it was eventually&#13;
deleted because Government had just started a nationwide Village Irrigation&#13;
Schemes Project (PID). The main fisheries activities that were being requested&#13;
during preparation were additional fishing boats and outboard motors. This&#13;
was however excluded because the Eastern Islands study"4 showed that&#13;
increasing capitalization may be leading to rising and an unsustainable level of&#13;
indebtedness of coastal fishing communities. Similarly earlier projects&#13;
involving boat and outboard motor credits were not very successful and hence&#13;
these were excluded.&#13;
(e) Implementation Arrangements. The experience of NTASP and other donor-&#13;
financed projects that directly involved the communities, has confirmed the&#13;
importance of beneficiary participation in project implementation. Under the&#13;
proposed project therefore, the kabupaten and lower level technical agencies&#13;
would work closely together with area CDOs to organize farmers and further&#13;
encourage beneficiary participation in the planning and implementation of all&#13;
area-based schemes.&#13;
Fiscal Implications and Cost Recovery&#13;
7.2   The agriculture development component that makes up over 80 percent of project&#13;
cost would be implemented by the existing provincial and kabupaten technical services.&#13;
The project would support the Dinas by training their staff, providing them with transport&#13;
facilities and equipment, and paying allowances to facilitate effective implementation of all&#13;
sub-components. None of these support measures would have fiscal implications beyond&#13;
the project implementation period. There would be no recruitment of new staff except&#13;
perhaps those to be contracted by CDOs as additional community development&#13;
facilitators.&#13;
7.3   Since a few years ago, the Ministry of Agriculture transferred the operation and&#13;
maintenance of the Rural Extension Centers (REC) and Animal Health Centers&#13;
(Poskeswan) to the kabupaten governments. However these governments have not&#13;
provided adequate financing for their operation. One of the objectives of the project&#13;
14 Eastern Islands Rural Sector Strategy Review, Yellow Cover Report, November 1994, Chap 5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
would be to make the existing RECs operational and convert them into multi-purpose&#13;
extension facilities and training and meeting center for the field level extension agents,&#13;
PPLs. A recent national study on decentralized study has confirmed that this is the&#13;
approach of follow. Similarly the project would work to make the Poskeswans effective.&#13;
For both the RECs and Poskeswans therefore, additional funding beyond what is currently&#13;
provided will be required to make them operational and effective. The project would&#13;
finance rehabilitation of the RECs and Poskeswans on condition that management plans&#13;
would be prepared and implemented for them (para. 3.16) including agreement from the&#13;
kabupaten concerned to pay the O&amp;M costs of the facilities. Assurances to this effect&#13;
were obtained during negotiations. In addition, assurances were obtained that fees would&#13;
be charged to the users of the Poskeswan that would contribute to paying for the&#13;
operating costs of the centers.&#13;
7.4   Farmers would be asked to contribute to the implementation of sub-components,&#13;
such as roads and water infrastructure, usually in the form of labor. For the irrigated&#13;
cropping, dryland cropping, treecrop rehabilitation, and homeplot improvements sub-&#13;
components, the project provides for a revolving credit scheme (para ...) that would&#13;
finance inputs for adopters. The research and extension components are by and large&#13;
public goods and are not practically amenable to direct cost recovery.&#13;
Poverty Impact&#13;
7.5    A major emphasis of the Eastem Islands Study was on identifying policies and&#13;
activities that not only will promote agricultural growth but help reduce poverty in eastern&#13;
Indonesia. The proposed project is one such activity that has been identified as a result of&#13;
the recommendations of the sector study. One of the main criteria for selecting project&#13;
areas and activities was to reach a large number of households below or near the poverty&#13;
line and hence implicit in the objectives of the project is poverty alleviation. Thus the main&#13;
Kecamatans with high incidence of poverty were targeted for project intervention.&#13;
Incomes of the population in the target areas are generally low and hence the expected&#13;
increases in household incomes demonstrated in the farm budget analyses should&#13;
contribute to reduce poverty in these areas. Thus if estimates of the proposed project's&#13;
quantifiable benefits for households, which show doubling of incomes for dryland and&#13;
treecrop rehabilitation (US$135 to about US$280, and US$230 to about US$470&#13;
equivalent respectively) and a 50 percent increase for households doing irrigated cropping,&#13;
are realized then the impact of the project on poverty reduction should be significant. The&#13;
project is also likely to generate substantial, but as yet not quantifiable, benefits for the&#13;
people in the targeted areas, such as better road access and improved availability of farm&#13;
produce and farm inputs.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
7.6   Treatment of Components. The project's Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was&#13;
estimated taking into account all project costs. Though research costs were added, no&#13;
direct benefits were assigned to the component. The impact of research would be long-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
term in nature and would extend well beyond the project areas to the entire territories of&#13;
the two Sulawesi provinces. Although calculating an ERR for the research component&#13;
would be difficult, it would be possible to relate research cost to the size of the&#13;
agricultural sector in the two provinces to estimate an ERR. The project's research&#13;
component would cost about US$1.6 million over six years. This investment would&#13;
generate an economic rate of return of more than 50 percent if it were to prompt a one-&#13;
time 0.25 percent increase in agricultural production (a conservative assumption) in the&#13;
two provinces from the third project year onwards.&#13;
7.7    No attempts were made to estimate separate ERRs for individual project&#13;
components or for different productive sub-components because: (a) most components&#13;
and sub-components are complementary, for example cropping and cattle keeping; and (b)&#13;
there are no clear-cut ways to allocate the cost of supporting investments, e.g. road&#13;
improvements, technical assistance and training, among the separate productive activities.&#13;
The cost of "other local community initiatives" have been included in the calculations even&#13;
though those activities and their benefits have not been identified as yet.&#13;
7.8   The economic prices for fertilizers were based on prices derived from World Bank&#13;
international price projections. The economic prices (1995 constant) used for rice, maize,&#13;
soybeans, and fertilizer were based on parity prices derived from World Bank international&#13;
market projections for these commodities, adjusted for east Indonesia transport costs. The&#13;
economic price of cashew was based on a recent FAO study which projected economic&#13;
farm gate prices for this commodity in the same provinces. The economic prices of&#13;
mungbeans and livestock were equated with local market prices as production of these&#13;
commodities in the target areas is not import substituting. No discount factor for labor&#13;
costs was used as most project areas are not densely populated and economic wage levels&#13;
are assumed to equal local market wage rates of Rp. 2,500 per day. A 20 year planning&#13;
horizon was used in the analysis.&#13;
7.9    Rate of Return. The ERR of the project has been estimated at 21 percent. A&#13;
summary of the cost and benefit streams are at Annex 6, Table 2.&#13;
7.10   Sensitivity Analysis. If some of the risks alluded to in para. 7.18 were to&#13;
materialize, the effect on the project's ERR would be as indicated below:&#13;
(a)    delay of benefits (but not of costs) due to institutional or technical&#13;
implementation problems:&#13;
(i)    by I year: ERR 16 percent; and&#13;
(ii)    by 2 years: ERR 9.7 percent&#13;
(b)   decrease in gross benefit levels due to overestimation of local governments'&#13;
capacity to provide adequate project follow-up support, or because of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
climatic or other technical difficulties (but all costs, including production&#13;
costs remaining as in base case):&#13;
(i)    by 10 percent : ERR 15.6 percent; and&#13;
(ii)    by 20 percent: ERR 9.1 percent&#13;
(c)   adoption levels for the crop development component lower than&#13;
anticipated due to farmers unwillingness to adopt the recommended new&#13;
technology (demonstration program however remains unchanged):&#13;
(i)   lower by fifty percent: ERR 13.6 percent; and&#13;
(ii)   lower by 75 percent for dryland and rehabilitation/50 percent&#13;
others: ERR 10.2 percent&#13;
7.11   Another sensitivity test conducted concerns the price of labor. Since there are&#13;
sometimes labor shortages during peak agricultural periods, we tested the ERR for the&#13;
possibility that the higher level of agricultural activities could lead to an increase in the&#13;
opportunity cost of labor. If project activities lead to an increase in the opportunity cost&#13;
of labor from the current Rp 2,500 per day to Rp 3,500 per day the project's ERR would&#13;
fall from 21 percent to 17.0 percent.&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
7.12   Environmental Screening. Proposed project interventions were screened during&#13;
preparation and an environmental analysis done of the different types of activities to assess&#13;
whether the proposed activities individually or cumulatively would result in any significant&#13;
impact on the environment and what environmental management procedures to put in&#13;
place. The main conclusions of the assessment are summarized below.&#13;
7.13   The assessment reviewed the environmental laws and procedures existing in&#13;
Indonesia and concluded that the project represents a category of activity that does not&#13;
clearly conform to any of the screening profiles in Indonesian environmental law. This is&#13;
because the project is multi-sectoral, and is designed to be implemented at the district level&#13;
in the form of numerous small, dispersed activities. In order to assess how project&#13;
activities fit into the environmental framework, the assessment sought to answer three&#13;
major questions: (i) whether any of the proposed categories of activities individually or&#13;
cumulatively result in significant impacts?; (ii) if the project taken as a whole would&#13;
produce significant cumulative impacts on the region?; and (iii) who is responsible for the&#13;
environmental management program under SAADP?&#13;
7.14  In trying to answer the above questions individual project activities were evaluated&#13;
to determine if they will produce significant impacts. The following characteristics of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
project area and the project design were reviewed and considered relevant to the&#13;
management of potential adverse environmental effects of the project:&#13;
(a) Physical Environment - Both provinces, but especially Central Sulawesi are&#13;
mountainous, with flat, arable land at a premium despite low overall population&#13;
density. The mountains are geologically young, with steep slopes, and highly erodible&#13;
soils in many areas. Settlements are clustered near the coast and in narrow inter-&#13;
montane valleys. Both provinces are predominated by infertile soils overlying&#13;
limestone and ultra-basic rocks. Southeast Sulawesi does contain large areas of&#13;
alluvial and rolling plains that could be made more productive, but rainfall is limited in&#13;
these areas".&#13;
(b) Land Classification/Protected Areas - Large portions of both provinces are within the&#13;
national forest estate, and a fair percentage of the forest land is classified in restrictive&#13;
use types such as Protection Forest or various types of natural area reserves The&#13;
island of Sulawesi is very biodiverse with high levels of endemism because it forms a&#13;
transition zone between the Asian and Australian bio-genetic realms. Central Sulawesi&#13;
contains three large and important protected areas: Lore Lindu National Park,&#13;
Morowali Strict Nature Reserve, and Togian Islands Strict Nature Reserve. Both&#13;
provinces contain a number of smaller protected areas&#13;
(c) Roads - Access to many of the areas in which project activities will be implemented is&#13;
difficult due to the poorly developed road network, making screening and monitoring&#13;
more difficult.&#13;
(d) Social - Rural populations are in general more isolated than in other provinces, and&#13;
have not been exposed to some of the production technologies being proposed under&#13;
the agriculture development component (A). Project participants will therefore&#13;
require greater than normal assistance to implement these activities in a technically and&#13;
environmentally sound manner. Community institutions are weak in many villages&#13;
because they are composed of relatively recent migrants from elsewhere in Sulawesi or&#13;
other Indonesian islands.; and&#13;
(e) Institutions - District and provincial government agencies in the two provinces are in&#13;
general underdeveloped compared with their counterparts in western Indonesia, and&#13;
have not had much experience implementing large projects or managing the&#13;
environmental&#13;
Environmental Impacts&#13;
7.15   The proposed activities do not pose an inherent threat to the environment,&#13;
particularly if implemented at low intensity levels and in widely scattered locations. Some&#13;
'5  The Ministry of Transmigration found as of 1988 that very few areas remain on the island of Sulawesi that have&#13;
not been settled and hence could be developed on a large scale basis (RePPProT).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
of the activities could produce significant local impacts if sited or implemented improperly.&#13;
During appraisal Government decided that the villages and sub-districts adjacent to the&#13;
Lore Lindu National Park (Lore Utara, Lore Selatan, Kulawi and the southern part of&#13;
Biromaru) that had initially been considered for inclusion in the project, be excluded since&#13;
a proposed integrated area development project to be financed by the Asian Development&#13;
Bank would cover these areas. None of the other sub-districts or villages bordering the&#13;
main national parks either in Southeast or Central Sulawesi is in the project area and hence&#13;
project activities would have practically no impact on the Parks and Nature Reserves. The&#13;
main project activities are analyzed below in terms of their inherent potential to produce&#13;
impacts.&#13;
7.16   Crop Development Program. The various activities in this component would&#13;
include:&#13;
(a) Irrigated Cropping Technology: This activity involves providing training, tools, and&#13;
inputs to help farmers increase rice, soy bean and mungbean yields from existing&#13;
irrigated fields. The proposed project's intervention in the schemes is limited to&#13;
demonstrations of improved cropping and livestock practices, including assistance for&#13;
production and use of improved seeds. It does not involve the physical upgrading of&#13;
irrigation facilities which is being done before the start of the proposed project, or will be&#13;
improved simultaneously under Government's village irrigation scheme. Potential&#13;
adverse environmental impacts could result from improper handling or application of&#13;
pesticides or fertilizers resulting in water contamination on-site and off-site, or health&#13;
risks to farmers applying the chemicals. The potential adverse environmental impacts&#13;
related to improper handling and application of pesticides and fertilizers will be&#13;
mitigated by appropriate training of extension agents and by insuring that the agents&#13;
pass on this information to farmers. In association with the Directorate General of&#13;
Foodcrops integrated pest management techniques would be introduced.&#13;
(b) Dryland Farming Systems Development: Improved techniques for dryland cropping&#13;
on sloping land can have the positive environmental effects of conserving soil and&#13;
water while producing a wider variety of crops. These positive effects can be negated&#13;
if the chosen techniques are not suited to soil and slope conditions, or if the techniques&#13;
are not properly implemented. Farmers are not generally familiar with these&#13;
techniques, and therefore the environmental outcome rests on the quantity and quality&#13;
of extension assistance provided to them. The mitigation plan would be similar to that&#13;
for the irrigation program and would involve improved training and awareness&#13;
programs.&#13;
(c) Home Garden Intensification: This activity is environmentally neutral with respect to&#13;
the natural environment, and potentially positive with respect to human nutrition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56&#13;
7.17   The Livestock Development Program covers:&#13;
(a) The Improvement and Operation of Animal Health Clinics: This activity has a&#13;
potentially positive environmental effect by reducing the incidence of disease in the&#13;
livestock population.&#13;
(b) Vaccination of Chickens Against Newcastle Disease: This activity is&#13;
environmentally positive in terms of limiting the incidence of this disease.&#13;
(c) Cattle Distribution: This activity poses some inherent risk to the environment that&#13;
can be mitigated by appropriate planning, training, execution and monitoring.&#13;
Potential impacts to be avoided are: 1) the spread of disease by moving sick animals&#13;
to areas free of disease; 2) damage to forest areas from free-roaming animals or&#13;
forest clearance to open grazing areas; and 3) run-off ofwaste from&#13;
holding areas. The mitigation plan involves a number of steps including; inspecting&#13;
cattle for disease prior to shipment; ensuring that recipient villages and groups have&#13;
adequate land and feed within existing village lands; and training recipient farmers to&#13;
control animals, to avoid plowing steep hillsides, and to use manure for fertilizer. This&#13;
component will be monitored frequently for compliance.&#13;
7.18  Improvement of Farm to Market Roads. This sub-component has the greatest&#13;
potential among all SAADP activities to cause adverse environmental impacts. Potential&#13;
impacts are: 1) improper construction or alignment can lead to soil erosion from the road&#13;
surface or cut and fill slopes; 2) improperly sized or constructed culverts or bridges can&#13;
impair surface water flow, especially in wet land areas; and 3) improper siting would&#13;
provide access and may cause disturbance to protected areas. These risks are however&#13;
reduced because the roads are generally short and would follow existing alignments.&#13;
However, risks stemming from improper construction are increased by the fact that&#13;
construction will be carried out by villagers rather than experienced contractors. Site&#13;
screening, construction supervision, and monitoring are required as mitigation measures.&#13;
A project manual similar to the one being used for the Village Infrastructure Project will&#13;
be used to guide villages through the road design and construction process, and to insure&#13;
that proper construction standards are used. In addition a screening process would be put&#13;
in place whereby the individual roads proposed for funding each year are evaluated to&#13;
ensure that their siting would not cause significant adverse impacts.&#13;
7.19  Institutional Measures. In order to ensure that the appropriate monitoring&#13;
procedures are put in place and that environmental concerns become part of routine&#13;
decision-making, environmental management activities would be integrated into the&#13;
institutional structure of the project. Environmental screening will especially be imbedded&#13;
into the annual proposal review and budgeting process. An Environmental Specialist will&#13;
be recruited for 3 months during the first year of the project to formulate Environmental&#13;
Management and Monitoring Plan templates, develop environmental training modules,&#13;
make recommendations for detailed institutional arrangements, and assist the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
managers to operationalize environment related activities. As part of its annual program&#13;
review process, the Provincial Coordination Committee (PCC) would ensure the screening&#13;
of all project proposals, making sure that the districts are formulating and implementing&#13;
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans as necessary in accordance with the&#13;
templates and regulations. The PCC can ask appropriately qualified institutions, such as&#13;
the Environmental Studies Center of the provincial university, to help it in the screening&#13;
process. The PCC would be responsible for implementing environmental training, and&#13;
monitoring the implementation of any management plans that may be necessary. Project&#13;
Management Units at district level would be responsible for ensuring that: 1) the&#13;
recommendations made by the screeners are incorporated into the annual proposal review&#13;
process; 2) the technical agencies have properly formulated and are following any&#13;
necessary environmental management and monitoring plans; and 3) the extension agents/&#13;
road engineers advising farmers/communities are trained to advise their clients how to plan&#13;
and implement project activities in an environmentally sound manner.&#13;
Impact on the Social and Cultural Environment.&#13;
7.20  The preparation process has included a social assessment study to establish an&#13;
initial socio-economic and cultural picture of the project areas and beneficiaries; assess the&#13;
impact of project activities on the local population and other stakeholders; examine and&#13;
find solutions for the local perceived constraints to agricultural development; and design&#13;
programs to meet aspirations of the local population. The assessment study recognizes&#13;
that though the two provinces are inhabited by diverse ethnic and linguistic groups no&#13;
serious social or cultural tensions have been reported in the target areas. Program design&#13;
and implementation would however need to be flexible and be adjusted to local conditions.&#13;
The principal conclusion of the assessment was that for the project to be sustainable&#13;
communities would have to participate fully in the planning and management process.&#13;
Project design therefore provides for this direct involvement of the local communities in&#13;
planning and implementation of project activities. The assessment study also reviewed the&#13;
possible impact of the different agricultural activities on the socio-economic situation of&#13;
the target areas. Though farmers in the project areas still adopt the cultural framework&#13;
associated with subsistence agriculture, it is not anticipated that any induced socio-&#13;
economic change would result in any deterioration of current social or cultural values.&#13;
Adoption of new technology by the project participants would be on a voluntary basis.&#13;
7.21  In order to maintain the high degree of community involvement required, the&#13;
project will finance community facilitators, to be recruited through CDOs. The latter are&#13;
expected to play a key role in identifying and implementation of operations under the&#13;
community based initiatives program, in farmer organization and training, and helping&#13;
farmer groups manage their revolving credit. For this purpose it has been agreed that a&#13;
draft standard-type agreement would be drawn up between the provincial authorities&#13;
(Bappeda TK I) in both provinces and reputable CDO(s) for the supply and management&#13;
of community development facilitators. The draft standard-type agreement would be&#13;
discussed during negotiations and the agreement signed before disbursements are made&#13;
on the community based initiatives program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
7.22  The project involves no resettlement and does not involve land acquisition for any&#13;
of the activities proposed either for field demonstration or the infrastructure components.&#13;
Demonstrations will be on farmers' fields to be managed by farmers themselves and road&#13;
construction would consist of upgrading of existing roads and tracks with no need for land&#13;
acquisition. Though the project would support local people indigenous to the two&#13;
provinces (as opposed to migrants) it does not involve any "indigenous" or "tribal"&#13;
peoples. None of the target areas appear to include locations of major monuments of&#13;
archaeological significance. Cultural habits and customs reflect a pattern of life that&#13;
centers on small scale farming activities. The project interventions would not change this&#13;
basic lifestyle, but aim to create a more sustainable pattern of land use and provide&#13;
technological options for improvement of agriculture and other economic activities.&#13;
Impact on Women and Youth&#13;
7.23  Reviewing rural conditions in Sulawesi confirms the central role played by women&#13;
in agricultural activities. Women and youth are involved in most aspects of the agricultural&#13;
production cycle from weeding and planting to harvesting and marketing in addition to&#13;
household tasks. Their responsibilities appear to be a lot more in foodcrop production and&#13;
house gardening than in estate crop production even though in the latter area they do most&#13;
of the harvesting, processing and marketing. They are normally responsible for small&#13;
livestock (chickens and ducks), less involved with goats and other small ruminants and not&#13;
usually involved in the husbandry of larger animals (cattle and water buffaloes). The&#13;
family concept appears to be very strong however and hence, women are reported to be&#13;
responsible for family finances.&#13;
7.24  The approach to be adopted regarding the different roles of men, women and&#13;
youth in the household, as well as in the production systems, is to make them equal&#13;
beneficiaries of all activities. Since the focus of project support would be on the&#13;
household, project interventions would need to address the specific needs of different&#13;
household members. Gender disaggregated data would have to be collected to obtain a&#13;
better picture of the role of various groups in the community and the household. The&#13;
project includes support for activities that are traditionally the responsibility of women,&#13;
such as home gardening, poultry vaccination, produce processing, marketing, small&#13;
enterprise development, etc. - the latter activities through the local initiatives component.&#13;
Other activities that can positively impact on women and youth also include provision of&#13;
credit, seeds and other inputs. Providing opportunities for increasing women and youth's&#13;
involvement in agricultural development, consistent with their active role in the sector, will&#13;
enhance their contribution to development. Gender sensitivity training for extension&#13;
workers, project staff, and community leaders will enhance their skills to tap this important&#13;
human resource and improve the participation of women and youth groups in the project.&#13;
Participation of women in the various project activities would be monitored in the M&amp;E&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
7.25   Three risks have been identified and taken into consideration in project formulation&#13;
and design:&#13;
(a)   Capacity of the Local Government Agencies. Sub-standard capabilities and&#13;
lack of experience and resources of these agencies could lead to delays in&#13;
achieving the implementation targets. The experience of NTASP, as indicated&#13;
in its ICR, has however shown that it is possible to work with inexperienced&#13;
local and provincial level institutions, strengthen them in their respective roles&#13;
in planning, implementing, and coordinating decentralized and multi-sectoral&#13;
interventions while at the same time providing useful services to farmers to&#13;
improve their productivity. The ICR of NTASP has also confirmed that the&#13;
focus on implementation through the existing administration structure at the&#13;
provincial, kabupaten and kecamatan levels, and a systematic effort for using&#13;
project area CDOs, are important and relevant approaches to ensure adequate&#13;
project impact. To minimize the risk, the project includes several training&#13;
activities for agency staff and community leaders at project start and&#13;
employment of technical assistance to assist in project implementation.&#13;
Operating means are also provided to ensure that staff are able to make&#13;
frequent field visits to plan and implement activities with farmers. The volume,&#13;
scale and complexity of project interventions would be planned from year to&#13;
year on the basis of a realistic assessment of institutional capacities, both in the&#13;
local Dinas and the participating CDOs.&#13;
(b)    Organizational structure and implementation arrangements. Institutional&#13;
and organizational complexity of the proposed project is another risk and may,&#13;
together with weaknesses of local technical agencies (referred to above), cause&#13;
implementation delays. This risk is reduced by defining clearly the&#13;
responsibilities of the various agencies involved in the project implementation&#13;
at all levels and using the existing structures and coordination arrangements&#13;
which would help project execution. Technical assistance would also help&#13;
improve the project management during the early stages of implementation.&#13;
(c)    Delays and possible abuse of the bottom-up process. The third risk involves&#13;
possible delays and even abuse of the bottom-up planning process that is to be&#13;
used to implement the agriculture activities. Local govenmment officials have&#13;
been used to implementing central sectoral operations for which instructions&#13;
are issued from the center. The proposed approach is therefore novel and may&#13;
take some time to implement. This risk is reduced by including CDOs, with&#13;
experience in community participation, in the farmer organization and planning&#13;
program. Also the first project year will be used for training of staff and&#13;
community leaders and to explain the project concept to them and to start field&#13;
level activities only in the second year.&#13;
&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
SULAWESI AGRICULTURAL AREA&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Implementation of Agricultural Area Development&#13;
A. Village Irrigation&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    There are a large number of village irrigation schemes in the project provinces&#13;
which have been established by the farmers without government assistance. Yields of&#13;
paddy in these schemes average about 3.0 tons/ha due to the use of low quality seeds, low&#13;
levels of fertilizer, and poor management of water. The Government launched in January&#13;
1995 an ambitious three-year national program to upgrade village irrigation schemes covering&#13;
some 900,000 ha, or about 90 percent of all schemes believed to exist in the country. The&#13;
program is known as Improvement of Village Irrigation Schemes (PID), and sometimes also&#13;
referred to as Village Irrigation Crash Program. The objective of the program is to quickly&#13;
improve diversion structures and canals in the majority of the country's village irrigation&#13;
systems (including those located in the two project provinces) and thereby increase Indonesia's&#13;
paddy production by about one million ton. The works are designed and executed by the&#13;
Public Works Department, either under contract or force account. It is anticipated that this&#13;
program will help upgrade the irrigation infrastructure in most of the schemes currently&#13;
exploited by farmers. Additional assistance is however required to successfully transfer&#13;
improved production technology to farmers to achieve maximum economic yields.&#13;
Proposed Program&#13;
2.    The objective of the project intervention is to transfer appropriate production&#13;
technology for intensification of rice and soybeans/mungbeans cultivation through&#13;
demonstrations of technology packages in village irrigation schemes in the target areas.&#13;
Demonstrations (3.0 ha. per village irrigation scheme for two years) would be carried out&#13;
on farmers' fields with the active participation of farmer groups. Project assistance would&#13;
be provided in the form of extension advice, training and provision of seeds, inputs and&#13;
agricultural tools.&#13;
3.    The Dinas Food Crops at the kabupaten level, with technical backing from the two&#13;
AIAT centers in Kendari and Palu and the provincial agricultural services and in close&#13;
consultation with the farmers, would be responsible for implementation of the demonstration&#13;
programs. Over the six project years, a series of on-farm irrigated crop demonstrations,&#13;
totaling about 3 ha per scheme would be established in about 60 village irrigation schemes&#13;
averaging 50 ha each in Southeast Sulawesi and in some 142 schemes in Central Sulawesi.&#13;
Typically the 3 ha demonstration would be established in adjacent 0.5 ha farm plots involving&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
six farmers in each scheme and will be supported for two years. Dinas staff, working together&#13;
with extension agents and farmer groups, would identify farmers willing to volunteer their&#13;
plots and services for the demonstrations. They would then assist the farmer groups with the&#13;
preparation of detailed plans for implementation of the demonstrations and train the farner&#13;
leaders in the proposed new technologies. The Dinas would arrange for the provision to the&#13;
farmers of seeds, fertilizer, tools and equipment for two cropping cycles of paddy and a&#13;
palawija crop (or a second paddy crop where water supply is adequate). Dinas and CDO&#13;
staff also would encourage the participating farmers to form groups and to set up revolving&#13;
funds for the purchase of farm inputs at the end of project financing (after Year 2).&#13;
4.      AdoDtionlReplication in Village krri2ation. Credit will be made available under the&#13;
viUage revolving credit scheme (Section I below) to farmers to purchase recommended and&#13;
tested inputs. To establish the annual program for adoption, farmers would make proposals&#13;
annually through the village level planning process with support from their PPL and the&#13;
community development facilitators. The village level proposals, will be consolidated at&#13;
the kecamatan level for transmission to the Kabupaten level where the Dinas will review&#13;
and consolidate all proposals for inclusion in the annual work program. For purposes of&#13;
calculating the impact of the project, it is assumed that in addition to the areas under&#13;
demonstration (180 ha in SE and 420 ha in Central), about 80 percent of the PID improved&#13;
schemes (7,550 ha out of 10,500 ha) involving about 20,000 beneficiaries will avail themselves&#13;
of the project assistance through the credit program to improve their cultivation practices.&#13;
Table I below gives the progression of estimated adoption of the irrigation technology by&#13;
Project Year.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                           ANNEX 1&#13;
5.    At the end of Government's 3 year Village Irrigation Improvement program (PID) in&#13;
1997, (6000 + 5000 ha planned for Central Sulawesi), the project may finance basic&#13;
infrastructure in any remaining desa irrigation sites within the project area to a total of RP&#13;
500,000/ha if necessary under the community initiative's component.&#13;
6.    Expected Results. It is estimated that just from the infrastructure improvements under&#13;
the PID program, farmers can increase their paddy yields from about 3 t/ha to about 4.5 t/ha&#13;
and soybean yields from 600 kg to 800 kg/ha. With the project intervention of improved&#13;
agricultural practices, and improved seeds, paddy yields are estimated to increase to 5.5 tons/ha&#13;
and soybeans to about 1,200 kg/ha. Estimates of incremental production are in Table A. 1 of&#13;
this Annex. A summary farm budget for a typical 0.5 ha plot of irrigated land is given in Table&#13;
A2&#13;
B. Food Crops Seed Multiplication&#13;
Background&#13;
7.    The provision of high quality seeds is an important part of the development program&#13;
for food crops production. The Government of Indonesia, since the introduction of the BIMAS&#13;
(mass guidance) in the early sixties, has considered seed production to be one of the five major&#13;
aspects in foodcrops production improvement. Since its first launching in the mid- Pelita I&#13;
period (1971), the seed multiplication program has been supported by various Government&#13;
policies on seed certification. However, the implementation of such policies has faced major&#13;
constraints at provincial and kabupaten level, so that the availability of extension seeds at the&#13;
farming level is not sufficient, in particular in the more remote areas in Indonesia, away from&#13;
Java and Bali.&#13;
8.    Therefore, in supporting the development of Sulawesi Tenggara and Sulawesi Tengah,&#13;
especially in the foodcrops production program with the introduction of improved technologies&#13;
and locally adapted varieties, the production of sufficient high quality seeds for farmers use, is&#13;
very critical. The Kabupaten Seed Multiplication Centers for Food Crops (BBP) are a critical&#13;
link between the Main Seed Production Center at provincial level (BBU) and the farmer seed&#13;
growers. One of the setbacks of the Government's recent past foundation seed delivery&#13;
policies, was that most varieties were selected under Java conditions only, but approved for&#13;
wider distribution. Fortunately, AARD and MOA now realize that different agro-ecological&#13;
zones with different management requirements and pests and diseases, need different&#13;
characteristics in the varieties. Varieties acceptable to Java, may not be good enough for other&#13;
islands.&#13;
9.    At present both the production of stock seed from the BBPs and extension seed from&#13;
the Farmer Seed Growers provide less than half of the total seed requirements of farmers who&#13;
now rely mainly on low yielding local and degenerated HYV varieties. Often the same seed is&#13;
used in different seasons, while different varieties are required. Seed purity (durability) and&#13;
viability are often below standard, resulting in poor germination and diminished yields. The&#13;
Government's attention in seed supplies has been mainly on rice in the past. However for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Sulawesi Tenggara and Tengah, other food crops such as maize, soybeans, mungbeans and&#13;
peanuts are equally important in the dryland farming system.&#13;
10.   Major constraints. The main constraints in the Indonesian seed industry, and on the&#13;
outer islands in particular, include:&#13;
* insufficient number of seed stations (private or public) in the country to produce and&#13;
multiply breeders seed;&#13;
* insufficient capacity and production of locally adapted, high quality provincial foundation&#13;
(BBI) and kabupaten stock (BBP) seeds to supply farmer seed growers;&#13;
* insufficient number of well trained extension seed producers/farmer seed growers;&#13;
* inadequate and poor organization of the Seeds Control and Certification Stations (SCCS);&#13;
*  insufficient recognition by the farmer users of the importance of using locally adapted, high&#13;
quality seeds and varieties in raising yields.&#13;
11.    The overall constraint, however, seems to be the strong govemment control in the&#13;
national seed production and delivery system, crowding out the private sector, and an&#13;
unattractive remuneration for breeders rights and the private seed sector.&#13;
Proposed Project intervention&#13;
12.   Since there is no viable private seed sector yet, the project will facilitate the production&#13;
of stock seeds at selected BBPs in the 8 project kabupatens, in order to supply sufficient high&#13;
quality seeds to farmer seed growers. These growers in tum will produce the much needed&#13;
improved extension (certified) seeds for the farmer users.&#13;
13.   Kabupaten Seed Multiplication Centers (BBPs) for Food Crops. The Project&#13;
would assist to improve the performance and functioning of one operational center per&#13;
kabupaten and provide funding for the rehabilitation of the center, provision of agricultural and&#13;
laboratory equipment to upgrade the existing operations and training of the center's staff&#13;
Centers which are mainly designed for rice multiplication and have no sufficient upland&#13;
themselves, would cooperate with the nearest BPP to use their land for the multiplication of&#13;
non-rice seeds, such as soybeans, maize, mungbeans and peanuts, depending on the farmers'&#13;
needs in the area. Each selected seed center would prepare an annual management and&#13;
production plan, to be approved by and contracted with the Provincial Coordinating&#13;
Committee and to be submitted to the Bank as part of the annual work program and budget&#13;
before financing is provided. The plan should provide information on the (expected) number of&#13;
cooperating farmer seed growers in its domain and should also include:&#13;
* operational program to produce the required seed based on available area;&#13;
*  cost of production of the seed and expected quantity to be produced;&#13;
*  proposals on how the stock seed will be marketed and expected sales revenue;&#13;
*  proposals on origin of foundation seed;&#13;
Estimated costs to the Project: some RP 50 million/kabupaten in the first two years after which&#13;
the centers should be self-financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Farmer Seed Growers Groups&#13;
14.   Selected volunteer farmers in the project target areas, would be trained by Dinas Food&#13;
Crops and Horticulture (DGFCH) to become certified seed growers for the supply of sufficient&#13;
extension seeds to other farmers. The seed-growers would be selected in small groups of 4&#13;
members, covering some 2 ha together. Depending on the farmers' ability, the quality and land&#13;
use patterns of their land, and the importance of the crop in the surrounding production area,&#13;
these groups would decide what major crop to multiply. In predominantly rice growing areas,&#13;
most groups would opt for rice or soybean, while in the dryland areas, maize, mungbeans and&#13;
peanut seeds would be more in demand. It is assumed that for rice and soybeans, there would&#13;
be one 2 ha seed growers' group per three irrigation villages, while for the other crops, there&#13;
would be one group per five participating villages. All these groups would initially be financed&#13;
under the Project. However, any farmer interested in seed production, should be able to&#13;
receive the training under the project to upgrade his/her own seed.&#13;
15.   Moreover it is strongly recommended to organize the seed growers in Seed-Growers&#13;
Associations with direct links, through contracts, to the BBP seed multiplication center for the&#13;
regular supply of high quality stock seeds and with the SCCS, for their timely field inspections&#13;
and certification. The project's cost estimates per ha of extension seed production for 2 years&#13;
for rice, soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts, varies from RP 1.1 to RP 1.3 million. Because of&#13;
the relative complexity of maize breeding, it is foreseen that initially most maize seeds have to&#13;
come from the BBU and the private sector.&#13;
C. Dryland Farming System Development&#13;
Background.&#13;
16.   The productivity of the prevailing smallholder systems of dryland agricultural&#13;
production in the target areas is low as are farm incomes. In addition, the practice of shifting&#13;
cultivation in some areas is leading to degradation of land resources. One of the most&#13;
important results that came from the Farming Systems Research program of the Nusa&#13;
Tenggara Agricultural Services Project (NTASP) was the necessity to stress the use of&#13;
conservation farming techniques in the fragile soils of eastern Indonesia and to link these&#13;
techniques to other farming activities such as livestock production. Because population&#13;
densities of Southeast and Central Sulawesi are still low, there has been a tendency to assume&#13;
that there is an abundance of unused land and that therefore, the need for conservation&#13;
practices to preserve soil fertility is not as important as in overcrowded Java. However given&#13;
the fragile and less productive soils of the East, it is in general even more important there to&#13;
practice conservation farming to preserve the shallow topsoils. Technology packages for&#13;
dryland farming systems development have been tested in many parts of Indonesia including in&#13;
some parts of Sulawesi and can be promoted in the target areas. Some commnon forms of&#13;
dryland farming techniques are the following: Alley Cropping (Tanaman Lorong); Contour&#13;
Ridge Terracing (Teras Guludan); Cover Crops; Living Fences (Pagar Hidup); and Bench&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67                          ANNEX 1&#13;
Terraces (Teras Bangku). In addition to these techniques promoting soil conservation, they&#13;
have the added advantage of providing additional fodder for animal feed and producing&#13;
fuelwood.&#13;
Project Intervention&#13;
17.   The objective of the intervention would be to introduce improved dryland farming&#13;
systems technology packages to increase farmer incomes and reduce negative environmental&#13;
effects from traditional cultivation systems. Diffusion of farming systems development&#13;
technology packages to area farmers would be carried out through provision of assistance to&#13;
farmers interested in adopting the technology. Project assistance would be provided for&#13;
demonstration, seedling/seed production, and replication. The main technique to be&#13;
promoted would be aDley cropping of lamtoro/gamal-vetiver/king grass, inter-cropping of food&#13;
crops with improved seeds and minimum level of inputs, and establishment of low density&#13;
plantings of cashew or other appropriate perennial crops. Nurseries to produce seedlings&#13;
would be implemented by the farmer groups with inputs being provided by the project. The&#13;
farmers would provide all labor without compensation.&#13;
18.   Demonstrations. The suitability of the technology packages would be demonstrated&#13;
in field demonstrations which would be established in each of the target areas. It is proposed to&#13;
have approximately a one 3 ha on-farm demonstration for each 3 project villages for a total of&#13;
380 demonstrations covering 1,140 ha. Each demonstration would involve a minimum of 4&#13;
farmers with an average farm size of 0.75 ha each. Support in the form of inputs will be&#13;
provided for two years. The executing agency would depend on the final design of the&#13;
technology package for each target area. If foodcrops are dominant in the farming systems&#13;
package, then the Dinas TK II Food Crops would be the local executing agency. If estate&#13;
crops are locally dominant, then Dinas TK II Estate Crops would be the executing agency. The&#13;
design of each demonstration would be done with support from the AIAT. Participating&#13;
farmers would receive all inputs free but be expected to provide the necessary labor as their&#13;
contribution. For each demonstration as well as replication, the project intervention would&#13;
consist of the following activities:&#13;
*  review of existing dryland areas and identification of priority areas for dryland farming&#13;
systems development activities;&#13;
*  preparation of location specific farming systems technology packages appropriate for each&#13;
area with technical input from staff from the Assessment Institute for Agricultural&#13;
Technology and discussions with area farmers;&#13;
*  training of farmer group leaders on dryland conservation farming systerns techniques&#13;
*  preparation of detailed plans and proposals for assistance for dryland farming system&#13;
development with farmer participation to be submitted through the LKMD and the bottom-&#13;
up planning system; and&#13;
*  provision of extension advice and a package of farm tools and inputs for up to 0.75 ha./&#13;
farmer during two years to farmers to assist them to establish areas on their own land using&#13;
the farming systems development technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
19.    Replication. In order to ensure that farmers who want to adopt and replicate&#13;
project activities and project introduced technology have the means to do so, the project&#13;
includes a provision for a village level revolving credit that would make funds available to&#13;
farmer groups for input purchase (Section I). The project would finance inputs for farmer&#13;
groups based on a clearly determined program of replication that they would establish with&#13;
support from the extension agents and community facilitators. Farmer group selection in&#13;
each village will be based on willingness of the group to adopt the recommended technical&#13;
package but where several groups are involved group selection will be done by a joint&#13;
commnittee including at least the Dinas for foodcrops, treecrops and in some cases the&#13;
Livestock and/or Fisheries Dinas, as well as a BRI representative, and village hamlet&#13;
heads (average of about 4 per village). It is expected that the PPLs and the CDFs will&#13;
help selected farmer groups prepare proposals for replication of project-introduced&#13;
technology&#13;
20.    The package to be financed for replication would include seedlings for the tree crop&#13;
considered suitable for the area, improved food crop seeds, tools and a minimum supply of&#13;
fertilizers and agro-chemicals for the tree crop seedlings and food crops. High yielding&#13;
varieties of food crop seeds would be procured from contract growers to be supported under&#13;
the project. Seedlings for the tree crops would be raised in private village nurseries that the&#13;
project would assist village communities to set up. Table 2 below gives the progression of&#13;
estimated adoption of the dryland farmiing technology by Project Year.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
69                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
21.   The selected drylandfarm model includes inter-cropped treecrops, including fruit-&#13;
trees, annual foodcrops (but no padi gogo) and fodder crops, including king grass and&#13;
leguminous trees; basic principles of soil conservation and maintenance of soil fertility will be&#13;
applied. Farmers are expected to shift from ladang and upland rice to permanent dryland&#13;
farming and maize. Cashew is the tree crop of choice since cashew is: (a) expected to be&#13;
suitable to many of the areas, (b) popular among the farmers, and (c) representative for the&#13;
costs and benefits of other tree crops. High value fruit and nut trees (kemiri, mango, citrus) are&#13;
also expected to be favored and in a few cases cocoa may be a viable tree crop alternative.&#13;
Three different types of models were analyzed under the following assumptions: Model I - 40&#13;
percent of project farmers would adopt this approach made up mainly of foodcrops plus fodder&#13;
and leguminous trees. There is no fertilizer use and yields are low as a consequence. Model 2&#13;
- also 40 percent of project farmers, includes cashew as the treecrop of choice, and moderate&#13;
use of fertilizer. Model 3 - 20 percent of project farmers, includes fruit trees as the 'tree crop"&#13;
and also fair use of fertilizer. Table A. 1 shows the component's estimated incremental&#13;
production under the above assumptions.&#13;
D. Village Treecrop Nurseries.&#13;
22.   Within the Ministry of Agriculture, the DGEC is responsible for the provision of&#13;
seedlings of commercial treecrops, such as rubber, oil palm, cashew, coconut, cacao, coffee&#13;
and tea, both to estates and smallholders. The DGFHC is responsible for the provision of all&#13;
other non-forest trees, including fruits, nuts and ornamental trees, mainly for homegarden use.&#13;
Improved treecrop varieties and clones are generated by specialized treecrops research centers&#13;
under AARD and the private sector. Except for coconuts (Manado) and oil palm (Medan),&#13;
most of the commercial treecrops research centers are located in Java. The center for fruit-trees&#13;
research is in Solok, Sumatra. As a consequence, the supply of improved treecrop seedlings to&#13;
Sulawesi Tenggara and Tengah, is very poor. Both Dinases (Estate and Foodcrops) have&#13;
scattered nurseries, mainly near existing BPPs, but cannot supply seedlings in sufficient&#13;
quantities to support the project in extending the inter-cropped dryland farming systems models&#13;
to reduce swidden agriculture, make dryland farming more permanent and improve/expand&#13;
conservation practices. Moreover, the quality of the seedlings is seldom uniform and need to&#13;
be improved (e.g. by using grafted rootstocks).&#13;
23.   Private nurseries of fruit and omamental trees can be found adjacent to the bigger cities&#13;
of Kendari and Palu. However in the more remote areas, seedlings are scarce. Therefore it is&#13;
proposed that under the Project, both Dinas-Dinas K II for estate and horticultural treecrops,&#13;
assist participating village communities to establish their own, privately run, village nursery.&#13;
These nurseries would then provide the needed seedlings at a reasonable price to farmers who&#13;
are willing to adopt the integrated crop production system or alley cropping and plant trees&#13;
along the field contours. The same nurseries would provide fruit trees and other seedlings to&#13;
the home gardens in the village. Therefore both Dinas-Dinas will have to play an important&#13;
role in the establishment of these multi-purpose nurseries and teach farmer owners the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                 ANNEX 1&#13;
operational and financial management and maintenance of their new enterprises. Initially all&#13;
inputs and seeds for the establishment and operation in the first two years, would be provided&#13;
under the project after which period the nursery has to be self financing through its sales of&#13;
seedlings. The total costs of the establishment of such a village nursery of 0.2 ha is estimated at&#13;
RP 2.5 million over two years. Under the Project, it is foreseen that one nursery may supply&#13;
seedlings for two neighboring village communities.&#13;
E. Treecrop Rehabilitation.&#13;
24.    Average yields of smaliholder cocoa and cashew in the target areas are low since&#13;
smallholder cultural practices (pruning, weeding and fertilization) for these crops are generally&#13;
poor. The area under smallholder cacao is about 25,000 ha in Central Sulawesi and 71,500 ha&#13;
in Southeast Sulawesi, while the area under cashew is 123,500 ha in Southeast and less than&#13;
8,000 ha in Central. The objective of this intervention would be to demonstrate to smallholders&#13;
in the target areas improved management techniques to rehabilitate existing plantings of cacao&#13;
or cashew. Project assistance would be provided for demonstration through inputs, planting&#13;
material and small tools and for replication through the village level credit system.&#13;
Demonstrations would be implemented on farmer fields and farmers would supply all labor.&#13;

25.    Demonstrations will be done to rehabilitate existing overgrown cashew (not shaded)&#13;
and cacao farms (shaded by coconut or other trees or bananas). There will be one&#13;
demonstration of 3 ha per two villages, either for cacao or for cashew. Villages on the&#13;
mainland of Sulawesi Tenggara, where both cacao and cashew do reasonably well, will have&#13;
one demonstration of either treecrop rehabilitation demo only. Farmers can obtain financing to&#13;
replicate the rehabilitation program through the village evolving credit system. The target&#13;
would be to get farmers to rehabilitate about 12 percent of the area currently under the two&#13;
crops. Table 3 above &amp; 4 below give the progression of estimated adoption of the&#13;
rehabilitation program for cocoa and cashew by project year.&#13;

1/ New financing from reimbursement is assumed equivalent to about 70 percent of previous year's credit&#13;
up to Year 7, 60 percent for Years 8 and 9, 40 percent for Year 10 and 0 percent thereafter.&#13;
Technical Intervention and Expected Results&#13;
26.    For cacao it is recommended to apply proper farm management (including the use of&#13;
fertilizer and agro-chemicals) and pruning techniques to improve tree shapes, fruit bearing,&#13;
crop sanitation and ventilation and improve the quality of the shade trees by planting lamtoro&#13;
and gamal trees. There is not expected to be any inter-planting with foodcrops and&#13;
recommended tree densities for mature cacao will be 400 - 500 trees/ha. Yields from the&#13;
rehabilitation are projected to go up from 300 kg/ha (without project situation) to about 800&#13;
kg/ha five years after rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                          ANNEX 1&#13;
27.   For cashew it is recommended to reduce the number of mature trees to some 33&#13;
trees/ha and plant foodcrops in between, such as corn and mungbeans. Alternatively high&#13;
quality cashew seedlings (40) can be planted to replace the ones which have been cut out,&#13;
which in turn will replace the oldest trees after some 4 to 6 years. In the meantime the AIAT in&#13;
Kendari will, with the assistance of Bogor and the Directorate General of Estate Crops (they&#13;
have a small collection on East Java), establish a superior 5 ha cashew garden for clonal&#13;
production (vegetative multiplication through grafting and budding). Most of the mother trees&#13;
material will be collected on the islands of Buton and Muna. Table A. I includes the estimated&#13;
increnental production from the rehabilitation program.&#13;
F. House Plot Development&#13;
Background&#13;
28.   Almost all rural households have house plots of 0.1 to 0.2 ha. However, the&#13;
productivity of these house plots tends to be low. There is significant potential to intensify&#13;
cultivation on these plots and introduce production of more fruits, vegetables, fuel wood, and&#13;
forage crops on these home gardens.&#13;
Proposed Developments&#13;
29.   Home garden cultivation would be improved under the project in order to improve&#13;
family nutrition and raise incomes. Intensification of cultivation would be carried out through&#13;
training of community leaders, demonstrations and replication through the revolving credit&#13;
system. Project assistance would be provided in the form of extension advice, seedlings, seeds,&#13;
inputs, and small tools. There will be a total of 360 ha of demonstrations (equivalent to about&#13;
1 demo of 0.2 ha each per villages in the target area).&#13;
30.   The Dinas Food Crops TK. II would implement this activity. The extension workers&#13;
would cooperate closely with the PKK in each location. The following activities would be&#13;
undertaken: (a) design of location specific technology packages in consultation with the&#13;
villagers, especially the women; (b) training of community leaders (in particular PKK) in&#13;
upgrading of home plots and sanitation; (c) provision of inputs for demonstrations; and (d)&#13;
assistance for villagers who also wish to upgrade their house plots.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
31.   It is expected that 1800 households would participate in the demonstrations while an&#13;
additional 7,000 households would replicate the program. Estimates of incremental production&#13;
are in Table A. I.&#13;
&#13;

73                           ANNEX 1&#13;
G. Livestock Development&#13;
Background&#13;
32.   Total livestock population in the two project areas consists of 1.2 million cattle, 56,000&#13;
buffalo, 340,000 small ruminants, approximately a quarter million pigs, and nearly 10 million&#13;
native poultry. Other important species include waterfowl and pigeons. Livestock contributes&#13;
approximately $ 5.5 million (4.4%) to regional GDP. The southern peninsula (South Sulawesi)&#13;
is a major cattle growing area where approximately 20% of the households depend on cattle&#13;
production as a major source of income, either derived from breeding, fattening, draught labor&#13;
and, indirectly, manure. Many of the agricultural areas in Central and Southeast Sulawesi,&#13;
however, have a low livestock population, leaving the rural population, without the buffer of&#13;
livestock ownership, more vulnerable to the risk of rainfed agriculture.&#13;
Lessons from past Distribution Programs.&#13;
33.   Livestock distribution started with the transmigration programs in the late seventies.&#13;
The major objective were to provide farmers with production and security means, by correcting&#13;
the two major market failures in transmigration areas e.g. lack of livestock markets, and the&#13;
lack of credit. Livestock were provided through an in kind credit systems whereby farmers&#13;
receive livestock and had to return two of the offspring within a given time period. Overall the&#13;
program has been successful in the distribution. The major target animal has been cattle, but&#13;
projects have also distributed goats as well as poultry. Overall the programs have been&#13;
appreciated by farmers. The perceived benefits were: improved welfare and increased house&#13;
hold security due to increased savings; increased productivity, production intensity and&#13;
security from use of manure and draught power; regular income from calf fattening (young&#13;
bulls 6-12 months).&#13;
34.   A recent review of the livestock distribution programs showed a number of problems&#13;
including: (i) bureaucratic delays in repayment in kind (e.g. farmers waiting till they can deliver&#13;
calf, with associated risks), (ii) inadequate animal health and services especially in remote areas,&#13;
(iii) lack of adequate feed in the dry season (mainly in drier areas), and (iv) the lack of&#13;
knowledge about animal husbandry of recipient farmers (and the lack of appropriate extension&#13;
help). In some areas farmers also complained about the lack of breeding service and/or access&#13;
to bulls. In addition most distribution systems have worked very much top down and have&#13;
rarely involved farmers in the planning and processing.&#13;
35.   There exist some experience with livestock distribution in the region, most recently in&#13;
an IFAD financed project that distributed livestock in a selected number of kabupaten both in&#13;
Central and Southeast Sulawesi. Among the recognized problems especially in the area in&#13;
previous distribution schemes was the lack of proper preparation of farmers, the lack of&#13;
sufficient training and technical assistance/supervision, lack of animal health services and other&#13;
institutional problems. The proposed project will draw on this experience but will be different&#13;
especially with respect to a greater decentralization of decision making and management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                           ANNEX 1&#13;
Project Intervention&#13;
36.   Management of the Distribution System. The project would provide support for&#13;
distribution of breeding cattle, promotion of intensive management systems, and establishment&#13;
of community-based revolving systems for redistribution of cattle in support of future farming&#13;
systems development activities. In each of the eight Kabupaten the Dinas TK II Livestock&#13;
would be responsible for implementing the distribution activities. In each kecamatan, a&#13;
working group for livestock distribution would be formed by the local Dinas TK II Livestock&#13;
to be composed oftheMantf' Ternak, PPLs for livestock, staff of the Animal Health Clinics,&#13;
village chiefs, and representatives of farmer groups, the kecamatan Community Development&#13;
Facilitator (CDF), and staff of Dinas TK II Livestock as necessary to be responsible for the&#13;
general supervision of the livestock distribution and credit system. Within the group will be a&#13;
livestock credit committee (made up of the community leaders) that will be specifically&#13;
responsible for managing the credit program (see Section I below). Under the supervision of&#13;
the Dinas TK  /PII[PRO, this group would be responsible for: selecting the desa's and farmer&#13;
groups to receive cattle and for cattle procurement. They will also be responsible for training&#13;
of the farrner groups; distribution of cattle to farmer groups; monitoring of the health of the&#13;
cattle distributed; and ensuring the repayment of the revolving credit. The PPL and kecamatan&#13;
level staff of the Dinas will be responsible for the provision of livestock/forage extension&#13;
services and veterinary services; maintenance of records on the performance (calving rates and&#13;
death losses) and supervision of the redistribution of cattle.&#13;
37.   The livestock distribution group will identify the areas where the livestock distribution&#13;
will take place and explain the criteria for receiving the livestock to potential beneficiaries.&#13;
Priority would be given to farmers meeting the following main criteria:&#13;
*  having developed or already using sustainable farm practices&#13;
*  not having owned livestock before&#13;
*  having expressed interest, and subsequently followed all the training&#13;
*  agreeing to develop the needed fencing and stables&#13;
*  having enough fodder crops planted to feed two animals year around, depending on&#13;
the area this may include 250 m of forage trees in hedge rows, or .25 ha of King&#13;
grass, or equivalent; and&#13;
*  having a farm income below the average for the kecamatan&#13;
38.   Before the program starts, the following main training will take place:&#13;
pre-planning Training. The Livestock Dinas, PPL's and others involved are to be&#13;
trained in: (i) interaction with farmers, (ii) farm business planning; (iii) training methods&#13;
e.g. tools, methods; (iv) technical issues relating to integrated farmning systems; (v)&#13;
technical issues relating to livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75                           ANNEX 1&#13;
pre-reception training of farmers that will consist of a three month, one meeting/week&#13;
training of the group in sustainable fodder crop cultivation, animal handling, animal&#13;
feeding, stable/fence construction, basic animal health etc.;&#13;
39.   Criteria in livestock selection should include size, age, weight and health condition.&#13;
Selection would be made by a group consisting of at least a representative of the Dinas TKII&#13;
livestock (PIMPRO), a representative of the recipient farmers groups, an experienced farner&#13;
(but not an official) from the same or adjacent area who has participated in earlier cattle&#13;
schemes, PPL with experience in cattle scheme and, where necessary a livestock expert of the&#13;
kabupaten or provincial Dinas. The suggested minimum requirements for cattle are:&#13;
Criteria            Bali breed           Local breed&#13;
Age                  1.5 years           1.5 years&#13;
Height male          105 cm              110 cm&#13;
female        102 cm              105 cm&#13;
Weight               150 Kg              180 Kg&#13;
Health              Certified            Certified&#13;
Status              Vaccinated           Vaccinated&#13;
40.   For the procurement of the cattle, it is expected that some farmer groups would&#13;
want to shop locally for their breeding animals while others may want the assistance of the&#13;
project to procure the animals. It is proposed therefore to allow half of the beneficiaries&#13;
to acquire their cattle through local shopping and procure the other half (US$1.5 million)&#13;
by NCB procedures and using a model bid document acceptable to the Bank. In the latter&#13;
case, the animals would be procured by the Dinas Livestock TK. II to the extent possible from&#13;
the local area and as close as possible to the distribution areas in order to: (i) limit the risk of&#13;
introducing new diseases etc.; (ii) reduce the stress of shipping on animals, and improve the&#13;
overall condition and survival rate (after transport); and (iii) procure animals that are common&#13;
to the area, and to many of the farmers, and extension staff.&#13;
41.    Some 4,400 cattle (females) and 440 bulls would be procured for distribution in&#13;
Central Sulawesi, and about 4,000 cattle and 400 bulls in Southeast. In addition, a total of&#13;
2,728 animals (2,480 cattle and 248 bulls) are expected to be redistributed in the two provinces&#13;
from calf repayments through the revolving credit system. Cattle distribution will be to groups&#13;
of 10 farmers each at the ratio of one bull for every ten heifers.&#13;
42.   The distribution of animals would start during the second project year, which would&#13;
allow sufficient time for selection and training of the beneficiaries and the planting of fodder&#13;
trees and grass. The project would establish a revolving system to redistribute cattle to&#13;
disadvantaged area farmers. Each recipient would be allowed to keep the first off-spring but&#13;
would have to return the second and third off-springs. Priority for receiving redistributed&#13;
animals would be given to other low income farmers among the participating farmer groups.&#13;
Future redistribution would be used to support future farming systems development efforts in&#13;
the targeted kecamatans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
76                          ANNEX 1&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
43.   Cattle distribution would provide a source of direct income to the participants through&#13;
the sale of offspring, as well as through their use for draft and transport purposes and the&#13;
production of manure. Fodder production would be an integral part of the conservation&#13;
farming system promoted under the project. The herd projections and the annual animal sales&#13;
quantities and values, without and with the project, are in Tables 4 and 5 ?, respectively&#13;
H. Poultry vaccination.&#13;
44.   Background. The most widely owned livestock in the target areas are chickens which&#13;
are raised in the home gardens of almost every rural household. Newcastle disease is a&#13;
common disease of chickens in the target areas and causes death losses of up to 80 % of&#13;
smallholder chickens annually. Control of this disease is therefore considered to be a high&#13;
priority by rural households, but access to vaccines and local knowledge on the use of vaccines&#13;
is limited. Though the government has made some effort to promote poultry vaccination&#13;
against Newcastle disease the effect has been limited by: (a) the need for refrigeration of the&#13;
vaccines; (b) the requirement of injections; and (c) the limited budgets for vaccines and&#13;
vaccination.&#13;
Project Intervention&#13;
45.   The project would provide support for training of area farners and especially women&#13;
in the techniques of vaccination of chickens against Newcastle disease. In each village&#13;
requesting assistance, vaccines would be provided (on a grant basis to the village but payable&#13;
by beneficiaries) during two years. The Dinas Livestock TK. II would coortinate this activity&#13;
and assist the women organization, the PKK (Family Welfare Organization) to implement the&#13;
vaccination program. In order to overcome limitations caused by the need for refrigeration, the&#13;
project is to introduce the new technology of a heat resistant vaccine ( the V4 strain) now&#13;
available in Indonesia. The project would fund initial introduction ofthe vaccine and training&#13;
of women groups in its use in the target.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
46.   The vaccination program would be implemented in all the 900 villages, where an&#13;
estimated 650,000 chickens will be vaccinated during the two year campaign. Losses from&#13;
Newcastle disease would be minimized and a capacity would be established to continue with&#13;
the vaccination program after the project is closed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                           ANNEX 1&#13;
1. Revolving Credit Program&#13;
47.   The program is expected to make available to farmers funds that would enable them to&#13;
adopt the recommended technologies and agricultural programs as well as undertake&#13;
agricultural processing and marketing. While the basic objective of the program would be to&#13;
ensure that farrners are able to replicate the agricultural programs, it was agreed at negotiations&#13;
that up to 40 percent of the grant available to each village may be used for agricultural&#13;
marketing or processing. Thus funds will be made available to villages as a Grant for on-&#13;
lending to farmer groups and members of the village essentially for the following:&#13;
* agricultural activities (seeds, seedlings, agricultural inputs, agricultural tools, animal&#13;
traction, etc .....&#13;
livestock production (forage production, poultry, ....),&#13;
* agricultural processing and trading&#13;
The following procedures and operating principles will be used for operating the village&#13;
revolving credit.&#13;
48.   Bank and Government Financing. Under the replication program, beneficiaries&#13;
from participating villages would use the funds received under the program to acquire the&#13;
seasonal inputs necessary for replication, and in later years, to develop alternative sources&#13;
of income. Beneficiary villages will on-lend the funds to farmer groups and individual&#13;
farmers who would have to repay the credit to the village to constitute the village-level&#13;
revolving credit. Similarly the villages may on-lend up to 40 percent of the Grant to&#13;
members of the village for agricultural marketing or processing. Bank financing will cover&#13;
70 percent of the grant to the village, while Government funding will pay for the remaining&#13;
30 percent.&#13;
49.    Credit Committee. For each village interested in using the revolving credit program,&#13;
a village credit committee will be set up including the village head, and the dusun heads. Each&#13;
village will have to include at least one woman in the committee. In all cases, where none of&#13;
the dusun heads or village head is a woman the women groups of the village will nominate one&#13;
woman from the village to serve on the committee. For each given year, the credit committee&#13;
will have the primary responsibility for reviewing credit applications and approving requests for&#13;
financing. For the replication program, the review of applications would be done in&#13;
consultation with the Dinas for foodcrops, treecrops and in some cases the Livestock&#13;
and/or Fisheries Dinas. Subject to the general credit conditions described in paras 51 to&#13;
53 below, the committee will also decide on the credit terms (amount, duration, interest and&#13;
repayment period), and ensure the repayment and subsequent on-lending to other groups in the&#13;
village.&#13;
50.   Eligibility and Credit Amount. In principle all members in a village, interested in&#13;
adopting the technology packages or in agricultural marketing or processing, will be eligible to&#13;
apply for the credit. However the maximum grant each village can obtain per year for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                          ANNEX 1&#13;
onlending to its members will be Rp. 10 million with the maximum over the life of the&#13;
project of Rp. 25 million.&#13;
51.   Application and Funding Procedures for Credit. With the help of the village&#13;
extension workers and the community development facilitators, farmer groups will prepare&#13;
projects for adopting the technological packages being promoted by the project or for&#13;
marketing or processing of agricultural produce as the case may be. Initial project proposals&#13;
(especially for replication) will be prepared annually, will be consolidated at the Kecamatan&#13;
level and transmitted to the Kabupaten for review by the Kabupaten coordinating comrnittee&#13;
and included in the annual work program for the approval of the provincial coordinating&#13;
committees. After the approval of the work program, the Kabupaten committee will inform&#13;
each kecamatan which in turn will inform each village credit committee of the proposals&#13;
retained for financing for the coming year.&#13;
52.   Towards the time when funding is needed, the concerned farmers will submit their&#13;
request for funding, that would include the activities and inputs they want financed, to the&#13;
village credit committee. After the approval of the committee the request would be transmitted&#13;
to the corresponding Dinas PIMPRO (foodcrops, estate crops or Livestock) depending on the&#13;
group's activity either directly or through the Kecamatan Dinas depending on whichever is&#13;
easier. The PIMPRO would then submit the request for funding to the project coordinator.&#13;
Funds may then be given to the village committee for on-lending to the farmer group. If a&#13;
village committee so desires, the project can also make direct payments to input suppliers.&#13;
Each village applying for a grant will have to show: (i) for purposes of replication, the names of&#13;
the farmers and/or farmer groups with the agricultural activities they want to undertake, the&#13;
areas involved, and the inputs they want to purchase; and (ii) for purposes of marketing and&#13;
processing, the village will present an indicative budget of the activity;&#13;
53.   Repayments. Repayment would be after the planting season and loan duration&#13;
would not exceed one year. Repayments would be made to the village credit committee&#13;
which will be required to open a special account at nearest financial institution, including a&#13;
commercial bank orpos giro. The minimum interest rate to be charged by the village&#13;
would be 15 percent per year in the initial years and a higher rate in the latter years.&#13;
However even in the earlier years the villages can charge higher interest rates if they so&#13;
wish. Funds repaid would remain in the village for on-lending to other members of the&#13;
village (operating in this way quite similar to the fund allocation under the Government's&#13;
IDT program).&#13;
54.   Peer pressure within the village setting (and other village groups waiting to benefit&#13;
from the repayment) is expected to lead to high rates of reimbursement as is the case&#13;
under the Hamlet Credit program of the Yogya Upland Agriculture Development Project.&#13;
In addition, as part of the process of ensuring full repayment, villages with farmer groups&#13;
or individuals having overdue loans may not be provided further grants. CDOs working in&#13;
the project will assist in setting up the credit program and in training the credit committee to&#13;
manage the credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                             ANNEX 1&#13;
55.    Livestock Revolving Credit. Some similar arrangements as the above input&#13;
credit will be made to cover the livestock revolving credit scheme. Past experience seems&#13;
to suggest that schemes that rely on the government technical agencies and BRI to police&#13;
repayment and redistribution are not completely sustainable after projects are completed.&#13;
Farmer groups and communities will play a more important role in managing the livestock&#13;
credit than has been done in previous livestock revolving schemes (especially the IFAD&#13;
financed projects). Even though BRI may be used as the channeling bank by virtue of its&#13;
presence in more rural areas than any other Bank, it is proposed that the contract for the&#13;
livestock credit be signed between the individual farmer and Kecamatan livestock&#13;
committees 1/ to be set up (regrouping heads of villages). The livestock committees will&#13;
be responsible for ensuring recuperation of the livestock credit and redistribution to&#13;
farmers who have not yet received the cattle and who meet the criteria to receive it. In&#13;
such a scheme, the role of BRI becomes that of an ordinary commercial bank.&#13;
J. Farm Access Roads&#13;
Background&#13;
56.    Poor road access and lack of other social infrastructure are major constraints for the&#13;
development of much of the eastem islands, including the two Sulawesi provinces. Many&#13;
villages still are not connected by all-weather roads to the provincial and kabupaten road&#13;
network and the condition of these district and provincial roads are also often poor. Existing&#13;
roads are often damaged by rain causing transportation breakdowns between villages and&#13;
markets. In the face of these needs, both the central and local Govemments have been&#13;
allocating large proportions of their development budgets to the upgrading of public&#13;
infrastructure. Improvement of transportation alone represented over 50 percent of regional&#13;
development expenditures in both target provinces during the Repelita V period. Despite these&#13;
past expenditures on road infrastructure, a recent OECF-financed study, entitled "Rural Areas&#13;
Infrastructure Development" (March 1994), estimates the cost of upgrading of village roads&#13;
and bridges in the "Desa Tertinggal" (IDT) villages2 at about US$40 million in Central&#13;
Sulawesi and US$17 million in Southeast Sulawesi.&#13;
57.    As part of the overall IDT program, OECF agreed to allocate about US$200 million&#13;
equivalent for the upgrading over two years (1995/96 and 1996/97) of rural infrastructure in&#13;
over 3,000 villages in 21 provinces, including the two Sulawesi provinces.3 Villages are being&#13;
selected in clusters of five of which at least three should be [DT villages. An amount of&#13;
US$65,000 equivalent is made available to each selected village for the construction of roads&#13;
and bridges, water supply and sanitation systems, and jetties. Existing Government procedures&#13;
l One could consider a Kecamatan committee per every 8 to 10 villages with each committee having a&#13;
representative from one of the villages.&#13;
2 About 51 percent of the villages in the Central Sulawesi project areas, and 59 percent in Southeast, are listed as&#13;
IDT villages.&#13;
3 A similar project, the Village Infrastructure Project (VIP) being financed by the Bank is under implementation in&#13;
Java.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80                           ANNEX 1&#13;
will be followed for approval, financing and implementation of the program. A special&#13;
INPRES4 will be allocated to the kabupaten and the works will be executed by contractors.&#13;
Consultants/supervising engineers employed under the OECF financed project will assist the&#13;
Dinas Public Works TK. II with the preparation of proposals and the design and supervision of&#13;
the works.&#13;
Project Intervention.&#13;
58.   Like in the rest of the project provinces, the condition of access roads, tracks and trails&#13;
to agricultural production areas in the targeted kecamatans is very poor. Access by motor&#13;
vehicles and carts is constrained and frequently farmers must carry all inputs and output from&#13;
the fields due to poor condition of the access roads. The project therefore provides for&#13;
improving the physical access to the agricultural production areas where village irrigation,&#13;
dryland farming systems development and estate crop demonstration activities have been&#13;
implemented. Project assistance would be provided to support design and improvement of&#13;
existing tracks, trails and rural roads that provide access to agricultural production areas. It is&#13;
expected that a substantial part of the budget allocation will be used for the design and&#13;
construction of bridges and culverts on existing rural roads and tracks which are critically in&#13;
need of improvement. Farm access roads would be upgraded to compacted aggregate surface&#13;
roads for use by motorcycles, animal drawn carts and four wheel vehicles. The alignments&#13;
would be made on existing foot-paths, so there would be no need to acquire land.&#13;
59.   In order to get the maximum participation of the population in the road&#13;
construction program, the construction program will be implemented by the village&#13;
resilience group, LKMD as is currently being done under the village infrastructure projects&#13;
(VIP) being financed by the Bank and OECF. Design and technical support would be&#13;
provided by the TK II Public Works Dinas in each Kabupaten. The construction manual,&#13;
already prepared for the VIP project in Bahasa Indonesia, will be adapted during the first&#13;
project year (by March 31, 1997) for use in implementing the component. A consultant&#13;
rural engineer/contracts specialist will be recruited by the project to oversee the&#13;
construction program and help with procurement and contracting. The consultant will be&#13;
responsible for preparing the project specific manual based on the VIP model and on&#13;
discussions with project beneficiaries.&#13;
Expected Results&#13;
60.   A total of about 660 kilometers of farm access roads would be upgraded to improve&#13;
access to village irrigation schemes, dryland farm systems production areas and estate crops&#13;
areas. Upgrading of farm to market roads would improve access to agricultural production&#13;
areas so that farmers spend less time per trip to their fields and are able to increase the&#13;
frequency of trips. Costs of transport of inputs and farm output would be effectively reduced.&#13;
It is proposed that the maximum allocation for each participating kecamatan (25 each in&#13;

less.&#13;
K. Local Community Initiatives&#13;
Background&#13;
61.   The bottom-up planning system, as specified in Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation&#13;
Number 9 of 1982, provides for the preparation of proposals for development activities from&#13;
the village level with screening at the higher levels. The system has the potential to improve&#13;
planning of project activities in order to respond more directly to the needs of the local people.&#13;
The main constraints of this planning system are: (a) insufficient capacity at the village and&#13;
kecamatan level to prepare proposals which are in line with the felt needs of the rural groups,&#13;
and (b) insufficient discretionary funding at the kabupaten level to respond to these proposals.&#13;
Lessons from Experience&#13;
62.   The social assessment undertaken as part of project preparation reviewed the&#13;
experience of different types of development programs financed in the two provinces. The&#13;
general conclusion was that for projects to be sustainable, they require a high degree of&#13;
community involvement and appropriation. Lessons indicate however that communities have&#13;
seldom fully participated in the management of community-based development (CBD)&#13;
programs. Social preparation to secure community commitment to and participation is very&#13;
important and help has to be provided to most communities in developing initiatives due to&#13;
weak village organizational structures. Similarly government officials need to be trained in&#13;
community-based initiatives.&#13;
63.   An approach that supported the development of community initiatives was tried under&#13;
the NTASP financed by the Bank. The experience showed that significant benefits can be&#13;
achieved from this approach. The ICR for NTASP5 observed that the overall development&#13;
impact and sustainability of this component were quite good but would have been enhanced if&#13;
program development had applied more rigorous criteria to define priority rankings for&#13;
interventions.&#13;
Project Intervention&#13;
64.   The proposed project would support local community initiatives which are expected to&#13;
result in direct benefits to the communities. Local leaders would be trained in community-&#13;
based planning methods and support will be provided for farmer and community organization.&#13;
The project would provide discretionary funding to support implementation of activities which&#13;
are considered to be a high priority by the local community and are technically and&#13;
economically feasible and environmentally sound. Though no specific limit has been set, it is&#13;
expected that each kecamatan would receive about Rp 90 million during the project&#13;
5Implementation Completion Report for NTASP, June 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                           ANNEX 1&#13;
(equivalent to some Rp 22.5 million or US$10,000 annually for four years). Generally it is&#13;
expected that a range of activities would be proposed in line with local conditions and&#13;
community preferences. Priority would be given to proposals for activities to promote farming&#13;
systems development which might include, but would not be limited to: revolving credit&#13;
systems for, water buffaloes, goats and pigs; introduction of new agricultural technology; post-&#13;
harvest processing and storage for food and estate crops; activities to control wild pigs; home&#13;
industries; and community managed infrastructure development activities (mostly water supply&#13;
and roads).&#13;
65.   Proposals would be made annually through the village level planning process and with&#13;
support from community development facilitators to be recruited under the project. The village&#13;
level proposals, formulated by farmer groups and/or villages with assistance from the&#13;
community development facilitators and/or CDOs, will be consolidated at the Kecamatan level&#13;
and reviewed to prioritize those with the greatest socio-economic impact and those expected to&#13;
improve rural incomes. The purpose of the review will be to ensure that proposed activities&#13;
meet the necessary criteria and to rank the activities coming from the kecamatan by order&#13;
of priority. The proposals will be forwarded to the Kabupaten, where the project steering&#13;
committee would review the proposals to ensure that they conform to the agreed criteria for&#13;
the component.&#13;
66.   Guidelines for selection of activities for funding would be established so as not to&#13;
delete the intent of eliciting priorities as identified by the community. A guide in Bahasa&#13;
Indonesia would be prepared as part of the training program for Community Development&#13;
Facilitators. To be selected for support by the project, the proposed schemes should meet the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
o technically feasible and economically justified productive activities;&#13;
*  activities have to be identified by the population to be of high priority;&#13;
-  the population has to demonstrate that the activity is in their manifest interest by their&#13;
willingness to contribute at least their labor, land and local materials where necessary to the&#13;
realization of the activity;&#13;
&#149;  the population has to demonstrate their willingness to provide for the operation and&#13;
maintenance of activities financed under the sub-component.&#13;
67.   In addition the following limits are expected to apply:&#13;
(a)    maximum amount per scheme: Rp 10,000,000;&#13;
(b)    maximum amount per beneficiary: Rp 250,000;&#13;
(c)    minimum number of beneficiaries per scheme will be 10 households except for&#13;
sparsely populated areas where the minimum shall be 3 households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83                         ANNEX 1&#13;
68.   Preference would be given to proposals which:&#13;
(a)   benefit the poorest segment of the community&#13;
(b)   involve women and youth groups;&#13;
(b)   are assisted by local CDOs;&#13;
(c)   have the lowest risk of failure;&#13;
(d)   have the greatest socio-economic impact; and&#13;
(e)   have the highest proposed contribution by the community&#13;
69.   Expected Results. The selected activities would measurably increase the incomes&#13;
and levels of welfare among the low income groups in the target areas. It is expected that&#13;
a minimum of 25,000 rural households would benefit from this activity.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
SULAWESI AGRICULTURAL AREA&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Regional Assessment Institutes for Agricultural Technology (AIATs)&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The main body for agricultural research in Indonesia is the Agency for Agricultural&#13;
Research and Development (AARD) which was established by Presidential Degree in 1974.&#13;
AARD is designated to coordinate, manage and conduct agricultural research and development&#13;
all over Indonesia. To adapt to the changing demands of the agricultural sector, AARD's role&#13;
has been evolving over time and is being assisted to meet this under the Bank assisted Second&#13;
Agricultural Research Management Project (ARMP II).&#13;
2.    The objective of ARMP II is to: (a) improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of&#13;
research and development(R&amp;D) through decentralization of services to the regions, and (b)&#13;
focus on specific agro-ecological zones (AEZ) and resource based development generating&#13;
location-specific technologies. This would also help achieve a more balanced development&#13;
between the regions. In addition, R&amp;D activities would focus on market oriented and demand&#13;
driven technologies to serve the changing needs of both farmers and consumers for higher&#13;
quality and more diversified products.&#13;
3.    Within the regional framework, the changing agricultural research strategy aims to&#13;
generate location specific technologies using a farming systems approach (FSR). This will be&#13;
achieved by five main related activities:&#13;
*  regional problem identification through better research-extension-farmer linkages;&#13;
*  closer collaboration between research and extension to generate and package&#13;
technologies to meet local farmers' needs;&#13;
* technology transfer which would link researchers, extension workers and farmers&#13;
closer together;&#13;
*  organization of field days; and&#13;
*  production of materials and information which meet and recognize the absorptive&#13;
capacity and educational level of the farmers.&#13;
This departure from the strong sector and commodity based and centrally managed approach&#13;
to research, demands a closer collaboration between regional research staff and local&#13;
government staff (in particular extension), members of the private sector, (including CDOs),&#13;
representatives of farmer groups as well as creating stronger links with regional universities, for&#13;
specific research topics and training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                          ANNEX 2&#13;
4.    AARD has taken action to reorient the mandates of 15 national commodity research&#13;
institutes of which: five are involved in foodcrops; three in horticulture; three in industrial&#13;
crops; two in livestock; and three in fisheries. Most of the stations of these national research&#13;
institutes, together with the nearest agricultural support and service centers have been frilly&#13;
integrated into 17 new Assessment Institutes for Agricultural Technology (AIAT) under&#13;
AARD's Center for Agricultural Socio-Economic Research (CASER). Under ARMP II, the&#13;
overall implementation of the AIAT programs is managed by one central Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU), headed by a central Director and assisted by a National Advisory Comnmittee.&#13;
Each AIAT is headed by a regional Director and supported by a small Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) under an ARMP II Sub-project Coordinator. The PIU Coordinator, supported by a&#13;
few AIAT staff, reports directly to the AIAT Director, who in tum reports to the ARMP II&#13;
Director. Only eight of the ALATs are Bank assisted under the ARM II Project, including the&#13;
Kendari AIAT in Sulawesi Tenggara and the Biromaru AIAT in Sulawesi Tengah. The&#13;
remaining 9 institutes will probably be financed directly by Government, ADB and other&#13;
donors.&#13;
The Sulawesi Regional Assessment Institutes for Agricultural Technology&#13;
5.    The two Sulawesi AIATs are now being strengthened and staffed by AARD research&#13;
staff, relocated from the national research stations to the regions, the two food crops sub-&#13;
stations of Wawotobi in Sulawesi Tenggara and Sidondo in Sulawesi Tengah, and their&#13;
respective Agricultural Information Centers (Balai Informasi Pertanian - BIP) in Kendari and&#13;
Biromaru. In each province there is a Regional Advisory Committee (RAC) chaired by the&#13;
head of each provincial BAPPEDA and co-chaired by the head of MOA's regional office&#13;
(Kanwil), with members drawn from various Dinas-Dinas, local universities, farmers' groups,&#13;
local CDOs and private sector. The RAC is expected to guide the AIAT and its Coordinator&#13;
on the research &amp; development program, priorities and policies. It will be assisted by a&#13;
Regional Technical Working Group (RTWG) drawn from the various agencies. Since both&#13;
AIATs also have to cover their neighboring provinces, Sulawesi Tenggara for Sulawesi Selatan&#13;
and Sulawesi Tengah for Sulawesi Utara, both AIATs have two RACs and two RTWGs.&#13;
Both AIATs have recently prepared their draft research work-plan proposals for the coming&#13;
years, which have to be financed under ARNMP II, but still need to be approved by the central&#13;
PMU at AARD. One of the first AIAT activities under the ARMP II project will be a FSR&#13;
Baseline Survey to support area development farming systems and fisheries research and&#13;
technology transfer.&#13;
Support of the AIATs to the Proposed SAADP&#13;
6.    In addition to their own programs under ARMP II, both AIATs will support the&#13;
SAADP Project in certain areas of development in the two provinces. They will support the&#13;
Project in the following three main areas.&#13;
(a)   assistance to the Dinas-Dinas Food, Estate Crops, Livestock and Fisheries&#13;
extension agents in the transfer of proven agricultural technologies and in the&#13;
design of the most relevant agro-technological demonstrations on farmers fields&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
95                           ANNEX 2&#13;
as funded under the Project. The Dinas-Dinas extension agents will remain&#13;
responsible for the actual organization, lay-out and monitoring of the&#13;
demonstrations and organize farmers groups discussion meetings;&#13;
(b)    carrying out specific applied, priority research projects in support of regional&#13;
agricultural development and based on identified local specific needs; for this&#13;
purpose the project provides 6 years of program funding; and&#13;
(c)    establishment, with the assistance of DGEC, of new superior mother trees&#13;
stock gardens for cashew (Kendari) and cacao (Biromaru), 5 ha each,&#13;
estimated at RP 61 million/ garden&#13;
Specific funds will be made available for these three components under the SAADP Project to&#13;
the two AIATs in Kendari and Biromaru to support the Project.&#13;
A. Demonstrations of Crop Production Technologies&#13;
7.    The recommended basic two year demonstrations to be carried out under the Project&#13;
are:&#13;
8.    Village inigated. rice and soybean production systems: based on local farmers capacity&#13;
and needs. Project inputs will include: tested improved rice and soybean varieties, relevant&#13;
fertilizer inputs, basic pest control chemicals and some equipment. The main technical themes&#13;
will involve: proper land preparation, timely (trans)planting, proper crop husbandry and on-&#13;
farm water management, reduction of harvest losses, etc. For rainfed sawahs, similar demos&#13;
can be carried out, using more adaptable, less risky hydromorphic varieties and reduced inputs.&#13;
9.    Dryland inter-cropped farming systems. Project inputs will include: tested improved&#13;
maize and mungbean varieties (including improved cassava cuttings where appropriate), high&#13;
quality cashew/other appropriate tree crop (including fruit tree) and leguminous tree seedlings,&#13;
king grass (for cattle fodder) and vetiver grass (to reduce/control erosion), fertilizers and&#13;
limited pesticides and some equipment. Demonstrations to be laid out on flat and steeper&#13;
sloping lands. Common forms of dryland farming techniques are: alley cropping (tanaman&#13;
lorong), contour ridge terracing (teras guludan), cover crops, living fences (pagar hidup) and&#13;
bench terraces (teras bangku).&#13;
10.   Rehabilitation of overgrown/closed in cashew farms. These demonstrations will mainly&#13;
be carried out in Sulawesi Tenggara, in particular on the islands of Muna and Buton. Mature&#13;
closed tree stands will be thinned out to some 33 trees/ha and interplanted with foodcrops and&#13;
new improved cashew seedlings, which at a much later stage will replace the older cashew&#13;
trees. Inputs: seeds, seedlings, fertilizers, some pesticides and equipment. Top grafting of&#13;
young seedlings and coppiced unproductive trees with superior clonal material will also be&#13;
demonstrated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
96                          ANNEX 2&#13;
11.   Rehabilitation of cacao under coconut or other mixed trees. For cacao, it is&#13;
recommended to apply proper pruning techniques to improve tree shape, fruit bearing and crop&#13;
sanitation and to improve the quality of the shade trees, e.g. larntoro and gamal.&#13;
Recommended densities for mature trees is 400 to 500 trees/ha. Inputs are: cacao seedlings&#13;
and leguminous shade tree seedlings for replacement of old trees, fertilizers, some pesticides&#13;
and equipment.&#13;
12.   Improvement of House Plots and Home Gardens. On average village house plots/home&#13;
gardens are about 0.2 ha and planted with a variety of crops (including vegetables) and fruit&#13;
trees. Under the Project, these gardens will be improved to increase production and their&#13;
nutritive and economic value. Better yielding fruit trees, vegetables and cash crops like vanilla,&#13;
pepper and ginger will be made available from the village nurseries through the PKK in the&#13;
village. The project will establish about 2 home garden improvement demos per village or 0.4&#13;
ha/village. One of the aspects of improved home gardening is to maximize the use of vegetative&#13;
waste and cow manure into garden compost. Costs per home garden demonstration is&#13;
estimated at RP 0.1 million, or RP 0.5 million/ha.&#13;
B. Applied Priority FSR Program&#13;
13.   The following applied research areas for the two AIATs, have been identified as&#13;
relevant to the Sulawesi Tenggara and Tengah SAADP Project:&#13;
(a)  Farming Systems Research on Cattle Fattening, making better use of crop&#13;
residues from dryland farms and leguminous trees clippings;&#13;
(b)  cashew research, including the introduction of vegetative multiplication, mainly&#13;
by the Kendari AIAT;&#13;
(c)  cacao research, including setting up a biological control/IPM program, mainly by&#13;
the Biromaru AIAT;&#13;
(d)  Fisheries and Coastal Ecosystems Research;&#13;
14.   Although the SAADP draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) provides a long list of&#13;
research projects in the above four categories, none of the AIATs or local government staff&#13;
met is familiar with the proposals. It is therefore recommended that during the first project&#13;
year, these research project proposals be reviewed in light of the ARMP II, FSR Baseline&#13;
Survey results (which should be completed by that time) and finalized by the two AIATs&#13;
themselves at two regional research workshops to be organized with the Regional Technical&#13;
Working Groups. Following the workshop's recommendations, and based on the actual&#13;
available manpower and capability at the two Institutes and supporting agencies, a realistic&#13;
research implementation plan for both AIATs will be developed. Such an approach will allow&#13;
for a better distribution of research tasks among the two AIATs and prevent overlapping, thus&#13;
reducing costs. To support the two regional FSR workshops, the SAADP Project would&#13;
provide 2 man-months of technical assistance to help the AIAT's to establish their research&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97                           ANNEX 2&#13;
priorities, in particular that of their FSR applied research program and to develop their research&#13;
implementation plans. Both institutes would receive additional intemational assistance in&#13;
developing their specific cashew and cacao research programs.&#13;
C. The Establishment of Superior Cashew and Cacao Mother Tree Gardens.&#13;
15.   Cashew. Sulawesi Tenggara is the main cashew producing province in Indonesia with&#13;
some 125,000 ha. Cashew plantings are concentrated in the lower rainfall areas, especially on&#13;
the islands of Muna and Buton. This crop has only been planted extensively by smalthoders&#13;
during the last ten to fifteen years and spacing, inter-cropping, management, and processing&#13;
practices are not always in accordance with technical recommendations. Initially, cashew&#13;
plantings were recommended by the Government to improve erosion control on denuded and&#13;
exhausted sloping and critical lands and to rehabilitate watersheds. Seeds and seedlings were&#13;
collected from anywhere to follow the planting rush. As a consequence, cashew tree stands are&#13;
very heterogeneous with all types of trees with different qualities and yield potentials. In some&#13;
areas, smallholders have established monocrop cashew plantings on land traditionally used for&#13;
foodcrops in response to the Government's promotion of cashew and have then cultivated&#13;
marginal uplands instead.&#13;
16.   The international market for cashew has been expanding continuously over the past 20&#13;
years. Therefore, as a most suitable industrial smallholders' crop, cashew has comparative&#13;
advantages in supporting national policies for agricultural development, particularly in the&#13;
Eastem part of Indonesia. Development of this crop could well contribute to increase farmers'&#13;
incomes, export earnings and agro-industrial development. Unfortunately, because of the&#13;
heterogeneity of the trees, productivity in Indonesia is relatively low in comparison with&#13;
production levels in Brazil and neighboring countries, such as India, Thailand, Vietnam and&#13;
Northern Australia.&#13;
17.   Although Indonesia has a major research center for most commercial treecrops, there is&#13;
no special research institute in Indonesia which deals particularly with cashew and the above&#13;
described problems. Consequently, it is recommended that under the SAADP Project, AIAT&#13;
Kendari gradually become a main cashew research activity center. To start this initiative, and&#13;
with the assistance of the Dinas for Estate Crops, a 5 ha superior mother tree garden for&#13;
cashew will be established in South Kendari under the SAADP Project, from where selected&#13;
clonal materials will eventually be further disseminated to Dinas-Dinas and village nurseries.&#13;
Because cashew can be easily vegetatively multiplied by top grafting or otherwise, the&#13;
establishment of the clonal seed garden and the dissemination of vegetative material can be&#13;
done relatively quickly. Besides financing a survey to identify potential high yielding and&#13;
tolerant cashew mother trees in farmers' fields in Sulawesi Tenggara, the Project would finance&#13;
(2 months) technical assistance for an international cashew specialist to assist AIAT Kendari&#13;
and collaborating Dinas Estate Crops in setting up such a superior mother trees stock garden&#13;
and provide guidance for developing its cashew research program. Total costs of the survey are&#13;
estimated to be RP 10 million, mutually covered by the project budgets of the provincial Dinas&#13;
Estate Crops and AIAT Kendari.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98                           ANNEX 2&#13;
18.   Cacao. Cacao is one of the main commercial tree crops in Sulawesi, with the two&#13;
project provinces Sulawesi Tenggara and Sulawesi Tengah in particular having a combined&#13;
area of some 95,000 ha. The provinces are rapidly expanding their cacao production and are&#13;
presently contributing more than 20% of the total national production. In particular Sulawesi&#13;
Tengah has a great potential for expansion. In comparison with other cacao producing areas in&#13;
Indonesia, Sulawesi is encountering its own production problems, due to poor quality of&#13;
seed/plant stock materials, the spread of the Cacao Pod Borer (CPB) disease from the North,&#13;
Helopeltis and the vascular streak dieback (VSD) disease. One of the recomnmendations by&#13;
MOA is to eradicate affected trees and condomize the fruits. However no farmer is willing to&#13;
cut down his cacao trees. Another problem are the heavy metals in many soils in Sulawesi,&#13;
affecting the quality of the cacao beans and butter. Cultural practices (especially proper pruning&#13;
and pest control) by local farmers are frequently less than adequate, since many farmers still&#13;
consider cacao as a "forest" crop, that needs to be harvested only. Like in the case of cashew,&#13;
research and extension support for cacao is inadequate and needs to be strengthened.&#13;
19.   The main cacao research institute in Indonesia is in Jember, East Java. Considering&#13;
however, the many new problems in production and expansion of cacao in Sulawesi, combined&#13;
with the different agro-ecological environments, the experience and knowledge of the Jember&#13;
cacao research institute may not be sufficient to answer the cacao production problems in&#13;
Sulawesi. Therefore it is strongly recommended that with the assistance from Jember, AIAT&#13;
Biromaru starts playing a much bigger role in cacao research for the Eastem Islands (including&#13;
Halmahera in Maluku), in the areas of improvement of seed and clonal stocks and the&#13;
development of biological control/IPM practices on farmers fields. Therefore, under the&#13;
SAADP Project, a start will be made in establishing a realistic cacao research program for&#13;
AIAT Biromaru and to establish a 5 ha superior mother tree garden in Sulawesi Tengah. The&#13;
Project will provide international technical (2 man-months) assistance to AIAT Biromaru to&#13;
develop the research program and to establish the mother trees garden (estimated costs: RP 61&#13;
million). Like in the case of cashew, Dinas Estate Crop will assist in the farmers' fields survey&#13;
to identify potential tolerant and well producing mother trees. Total costs of the survey are&#13;
estimated to be RP 10 million, mutually covered by the project budgets of the provincial Dinas&#13;
Estate Crops and AIAT Biromaru.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Sulawesi
            Agricultural Area Development Project are to assist the
            government in reducing the incidence of poverty in the
            provinces of Central and Southeast Sulawesi through the
            increase of rural incomes, the promotion of equitable
            regional development, the promotion of environmentally
            sustainable farming practices, and the strengthening of
            local level institutions. The specific objectives of the
            project are to: 1) increase farmer productivity and incomes;
            2) promote environmentally sustainable farming practices;
            and 3) improve the capacity of local institutions to
            identify, prepare, appraise and manage agricultural
            development programs. The project has three broad
            components: 1) agriculture-based area development, including
            a crop development program, livestock management and
            veterinary care, farm access roads, and community based
            initiatives; 2) project management and capacity
            strengthening of local agricultural support services
            comprising the rehabilitation and improvement of facilities,
            training, workshops, seminars, and technical assistance; and
            3) farming systems and fisheries research support and
            technology transfer.
