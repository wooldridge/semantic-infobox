I. PROJECTSTRATEGYANDOBJECTIVES&#13;
Project Strategy&#13;
1. Inline withthe approach developedthrough consultations with countries anddonors,&#13;
thisproject will focus on areaso flocust control andpreventionwhere the World Bank&#13;
has a comparative advantage: (i)   provision o f quick financial assistance for the imports&#13;
necessary for control operations, (ii) reconstruction activities (restoring productive assets&#13;
andproviding bridgingincome-earning activities), and (iii)     assistance to improve the&#13;
early warning, mobilization, andmitigation systems.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
2. The project aims to helpreduce the hardships imposedon people andthe environment&#13;
by current and future locust invasions. These hardshipsnot only include the immediate&#13;
effects o f crop and livestock losses, but also delayed effects from lost productive assets&#13;
andreduced income opportunities. It i s the rural poor who suffer most from the effects&#13;
locust infestation. The risks posed to people andthe environment from application,&#13;
handling, andstorage o fpesticides are equally significant.&#13;
3. The project will also seek to reduce the vulnerability o fthe concerned countries to&#13;
future infestationsby supportingimproved strategies for prevention, early warning,&#13;
reaction, andmitigation at boththe national and regional levels. Regional collective&#13;
action is required to respondto this regional plague.&#13;
4. The project (i) on the Bank's areas o f comparative advantage inproviding&#13;
                    focuses&#13;
financing at the country level for activities that will complement funds committedby&#13;
other donors for regional initiatives, and (ii) buildsupon existing World Bank&#13;
                                                and&#13;
operations inthe region inorder to respond quickly to the crisis.&#13;
5. The ProjectDevelopmentObjective(PDO) i s to reduce the vulnerability o f the&#13;
concerned countries to future infestationsby supporting improved strategies for&#13;
prevention, early warning, reaction, andmitigation, at boththe national andregional&#13;
levels. This will be achieved by (i) helping countries to controllmanage locust&#13;
infestations, (ii)mitigating the effects o f locust infestations on people andthe&#13;
environment, and (iii)  helpingto ensure amore timely reactionto future infestations in&#13;
Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, and The Gambia.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
6. The project will include a number o f emergency activities, post-emergency recovery&#13;
activities, and activities to improve future preparedness. These activities have been&#13;
organized into four components:&#13;
&#13;
Component A: Emergency Locust Management&#13;
7. This component includes investments for the emergency actions requiredto ensure&#13;
that locust management activities are timely, cost-effective, and environmentally and&#13;
socially sustainable. Two types o f activities will be supported inthis component: (i)   an&#13;
emergency locust campaign required to manage any current or resurgent infestations, and&#13;
(ii) inventoriesofpesticidesandevaluationofpesticidestorageareastoensure&#13;
    detailed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effective management after the crisis, includingupgrade o f storage areas, and if&#13;
necessary, preparation for disposal o f any obsolete pesticides inthe country.&#13;
Component B: Emergency Agriculture Investments&#13;
8. This component includes investments for the emergency actions requiredto restore&#13;
agricultural productivity inpriority rural areas that were damaged by locusts. Investments&#13;
to be provided include provision o f `starter packs' (seeds, fertilizers, tools) and animal&#13;
feed to rural populations, andmay also includejob creation for those who have lost&#13;
cropshncome due to locust infestation. Suchjobs will be created through existing&#13;
community-driven development or social projects and could include small-scale local&#13;
civil works. Financing o f activities under this component will complement that o f other&#13;
donors andwill be within the framework o fthe needs expressed by FAO, WFP, and&#13;
CILSS.&#13;
Component C: Early Warning and Response&#13;
9.     This component includes medium- andlong-term activities requiredto strengthen&#13;
the national capacity for early warning andresponse to outbreaks. World Bank financing&#13;
o f activities inthis component will complement investments made by the European&#13;
Commission andthe African Development Bank for the EMPRESprogram initiatedby&#13;
FAO. Investments will be made inthree areas: (i)     strengtheningthe early warning system&#13;
procedures (capacity o f crop protection agencies), (ii)  equipment, sohare, andother&#13;
goods requiredto operationalizethe system, and(iii)     awareness campaign and&#13;
mobilization of village brigades for early warning. Component D: Project Management&#13;
10.    The output o fthis component will be effective project management (which is,&#13;
designed, adjusted, monitored, andevaluated to reflect changing conditions) that would&#13;
be able to address potentially shiftingrequirements andpriorities o f the effort to help&#13;
manage locust infestations, as well as their effects on people and the environment inthe&#13;
concerned countries.&#13;
Activities with Regional Scope&#13;
11. There are three areas o fintervention that warrant a regional approach -&#13;
coordination o f locust control, research into alternatives to chemical control measures,&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation. Such activities will be financed through specific&#13;
earmarked allocations inthe country projects. The coordination o f the regional work&#13;
would take place at annual meetings o f countries participating inthis project, or at other&#13;
relevant events such as sessions o f CLCPRO.&#13;
Considerations for Flexibility of Project Design&#13;
12.    Project Design. The project i s part o f the countries' overall emergency locust&#13;
control programs. It has been designed inan emergency on the basis o f available, very&#13;
preliminaryinformation about (i) magnitude o f actual infestation andits projected&#13;
                                    the&#13;
evolution, and o f estimates o f already andpotentially affected communities; and (ii)   the&#13;
already mobilized and committed financial support. It is therefore likely that both its&#13;
detailed design and fundingwill need to be adjusted to fit the evolution o f the situation on&#13;
the ground and additional financial resources that may become available. Estimatedcosts&#13;
include important physical contingencies. Readjustments inprogram emphasis and&#13;
detailed content, as well as reallocations o f funds between components, will be done&#13;
every year, or as necessary inclose cooperationwith all fundingpartners. Revisions will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be based on actual development needs as tracked bythe M&amp;E system that will be&#13;
established at the beginning o fthe program. Unnecessary/unused funds from the IDA&#13;
credit will be cancelled at the end o f the project.&#13;
Designof ComponentsA andB&#13;
13.   A -EmergencyLocustManagementandB-EmergencySupportto&#13;
AffectedPopulations.Special attentionwill be givento establishing efficient targeting&#13;
mechanisms anddefining sequencing and scale-up scenarios for the various activities&#13;
involved inthese components. These actions are intendedto optimize the efficiency o f&#13;
project activities and minimize its environmentalimpact. Specific performance indicators&#13;
and triggers will be usedto determine the progress and success o fthe individual phases&#13;
and subsequent program. An independent M&amp;E committee will be established at the&#13;
outset, composed o fkey stakeholders (government, donors, NGOs, rural communities,&#13;
civil society, etc ), which will convene on a regular basis to track implementation&#13;
progress and evaluate performance. Adjustments indesign and scope will evolve andbe&#13;
implemented as the situation develops. After the first year o f implementation, ajoint in-&#13;
depth implementation review will be carried out and the project will be scaled-up or&#13;
down depending on outcomes/progress.&#13;
Project PreparationAdvances&#13;
14.   Emergency locust control operations beganinJuly 2004 inmost o fthe affected&#13;
countries. Duringthe identificationmission, the Bank signed Project Preparation Facility&#13;
(PPF) advances representing a total ofUS$12,390,000 with seven countries (Burkina&#13;
Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). Inaddition, the&#13;
governments are projecting that an aggregated amount o f about U S $ l O million could be&#13;
submittedfor retroactive financing. PPFadvances andretroactive financing ineach&#13;
country will support control campaigns through the remainder o f 2004 before main&#13;
swarms start to migrate to areas with heavier rainfalls. These control activities are&#13;
intended to prevent re-infestation in2005 o fthe Sahelian countries already badly&#13;
affected.&#13;
15.    The following table presents PPF advances approved on September 22,2004 and&#13;
the projecteddisbursement bythe end o fDecember 2004. The disbursedamount i s&#13;
currently less that anticipatedbecause the needfor funding emergency control activities&#13;
was reduced during October due to an early migration o f swarms away from the countries&#13;
concerned by this project.&#13;

16.    Background.Breedingandmigrationpatterns o fdesert locusts cover some 28&#13;
million sq. km and 65 countries inAfrica, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. Since&#13;
1860, there havebeen ten major upsurges o f desert locusts inthese areas. Organized crop&#13;
protection campaigns against locusts began inthe early 1900s. Duringthe 1 9 5 0 FA0   ~ ~&#13;
established regional sub-committees for each o f the important geopolitical regions&#13;
associatedwith desert locust migrations (Northwest Africa, Near East and Southwest&#13;
Asia). These evolved into FA0Regional Commissions concerned primarily with the&#13;
coordination of joint surveys, control, training, andresearchbymember states. Member&#13;
states finance activities unilaterally andthrough contributions to a trust h d , set their&#13;
own policies, anddetermine survey and control activities.&#13;
17. Intandem with FAO's initiatives, autonomous regional organizations for locust&#13;
control also emerged, initially as offshoots o f earlier colonial structures. InEast Africa,&#13;
the Desert Locust Control Organization for Eastern Africa (DLCO-EA) was created with&#13;
a mandate to address all migratory pests, with emphasis onbackstoppingheinforcingthe&#13;
locust control capacity o f its member states (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia,&#13;
Sudan, Tanzania, andUganda). InWest Africa, the mandate o fthe Organisation&#13;
Commune de LutteAntiacridienne (OCLA), established in 1958, was expanded to&#13;
address migratory insect and avian pests (OCLALAV), however, OCLALAV's&#13;
operationalmandate reverted to its member states in 1989, leaving a void interms of&#13;
collective decision-making and action at the regional level. In recent years, CILSS&#13;
(Commit6 Inter-Etat pour la Lutte contre la Secheresse dans le Sahel), which is charged&#13;
with fightingdrought inthe Sahel andalso mandated to provide technical support and&#13;
training inplant protection (including registration o fpesticides), has provided&#13;
meteorological information andvegetation data andrelatedmaps through its&#13;
AGRHYMETdepartment (Agriculture, Hydrology andMeteorology).&#13;
18. PresentGlobalandRegionalCoordinationMechanism.At the international level,&#13;
the Desert Locust Control Committee (DLCC), which was established in 1952, includes&#13;
65 countries and is hostedby FAO. It leads the technical discussions about locust&#13;
management. The DLCC created the Emergency Center for Locust Operations (ECLO)&#13;
andthree regional commissions, including CLCPRO (Commission de luttecontre le&#13;
criquet pblerin dans la r6gion Occidentale [Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust&#13;
inthe Western Region]) incharge ofcoordinating locust operations innine frontline&#13;
countries o fNorth and West Africa. In 1994, FA0 also launched the Emergency&#13;
Prevention System (EMPRES) for Trans-boundary Animal and Plant Pests andDiseases.&#13;
19. EmergencyCenter for LocustOperations(ECLO). InAugust 2004, FA0re-&#13;
established ECLO based at FA0headquarters inorder to strengthen its response to the&#13;
locust upsurge.ECLO continually monitors the locust situation andi s the focal point for&#13;
assistance to locust-affected countries.&#13;
20. ECLO works closely with CLCPRO, which i s responsible for coordination o f locust&#13;
activities innine front-line countries.&#13;
21. ECLO maintains a regular dialogue with the international donor community.&#13;
Priorities for assistance are based on information provided almost every day bynational&#13;
locust control units andplantprotection services, supplemented by reports from FAO's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
country representatives and advice from FA0 consultants inthe field. For funds routed&#13;
through FAO, ECLO implements individualprojects, provides the agreed inputs, which&#13;
often include flying hours, pesticides, operating costs, equipment, environmental&#13;
monitoring, andtechnical advice. ECLO also collects bilateral assistance inorder to&#13;
coordinate inputs and avoid duplicate efforts.&#13;
22. EmergencyPreventionSystem.When EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System for&#13;
Trans-boundary Animal andPlant Pests and Diseases) was founded in 1994, initial&#13;
priority was given to trans-boundary pest and disease problems. The desert locust is a big&#13;
component o f EMPRES because it i s considered a serious and large-scale threat to&#13;
agricultural production inAfrica. Its frequent swarmmigrations across borders often&#13;
require large-scale regional control operations. EMPRES i s structured byregion covering&#13;
the western region (EMPRES-RO), the centralregion (EMPRES-RC) andthe eastern&#13;
region (EMPRES-ER).&#13;
23. CommissionDeLutteContreL e CriquetPklerinDansL a RCgionOccidentale&#13;
(CLCPRO). This commissionpromotes, at the national, regional, andinternational&#13;
levels, action, research, and training to ensure prevention of, and appropriate response to,&#13;
the invasions o f desert locust inthe western region o f its distribution area, Northwest and&#13;
West Africa.&#13;
24. The western region o f the invasion area includes Algeria, Chad, Libya, Mali,&#13;
Morocco, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, andTunisia, countries inwhich the locust behaves&#13;
gregariously or that are directly affectedby all early upsurges. CLCPRO is hostedby the&#13;
Algeriangovernment inAlgiers andrepresents the central forum for locust management&#13;
today.&#13;
RootCauses of DesertLocustInvasions&#13;
25. There is a consensus among experts andmajor actors on the key factors that have led&#13;
to the present locust emergency. Principal among these is the lack o fpreparedness at the&#13;
national, regional and international levels. The failure o f the affected countries andtheir&#13;
partnersto maintain a minimalcapacity duringthe longremissionphaseshas resultedina&#13;
weakened system unable to respond ina timely fashion to prevent the current upsurge.&#13;
The organizations and mechanisms for regional coordination are limited to a consultative&#13;
role and do not have the operational function that is desperately needed for trans-&#13;
boundary actions -regional mobilization andpooling o f resources to provide a timely&#13;
response where andwhen needed.&#13;
26. At the international level, mobilization o fthe necessary funds has beentoo slow to be&#13;
effective. Donor interest inlong-term development goals o f locust management has&#13;
tended to vary with the situation andwere very low duringthe recession period o f 1994&#13;
to 2004. The EMPRES project didnot have sufficient funds, OCLALAV was not&#13;
operational, anduntilthe crisis became significantly aggravated toward June and July,&#13;
donor contributions were limited despite numerous appeals by FAO. Another important&#13;
issue to note i s that the rationale for triggering control operations has not always based on&#13;
realistic assessmentso f risks, but rather insome cases on political considerations. In&#13;
summary, the present systemis too dependent on donors, with a serious lack o flong-term&#13;
commitment duringremission phases.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  Project Strategy&#13;
  28. Inorder to create a sound and sustainable locust management program, the project&#13;
  favors a strategy based on ecologicalprinciples and IntegratedPest Management (IPM).&#13;
  Actions need to be targeted at the national, regional, and international levels. The project&#13;
  strategy will include:&#13;
&#13;
  0   Efficient monitoring and surveillance systems staffedbywell-trained andwell-&#13;
       equippednational teams to monitor, assess risks, andtrigger early warnings. The&#13;
       early warnings need to be translated into actions that will trigger a well-articulated&#13;
       emergency planfor rapid response incase o f an upsurge.&#13;
  0   A regional coordinationentity that is legally autonomous, owned andempowered by&#13;
      member countries, with an adequatemandate, operatingpolicies, fimdingmechanism,&#13;
       and the necessary human and financial resources to coordinate local andtrans-&#13;
      boundary efforts with the active participation o f affectednational programs.&#13;
  0    A regionayinternational fundingmechanismable to mobilize the resources neededto&#13;
       control outbreaks ina timely fashion andpotentially fundnecessary post-disaster&#13;
      mitigation activities to support affected populations andrebuild productive assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
, 29. The project aims to strengthen the capacity o fnational programs to meet the&#13;
  necessary requirements for an efficient monitoring and surveillance system at the national&#13;
  level. The project recommends a complete review or audit o fthe existingregional&#13;
  systems for locust monitoring andcontrol. Theproposedreview will address technical,&#13;
  institutional, operational, regulatory, and financial capacities, including identificationo f&#13;
  sustainable risks and cost-sharing mechanisms by interested countries to maintain&#13;
  minimal and operational expertise. Inconsultation with CLCPROmember countries, a&#13;
  panelo fexperts will initiatethe review andmakerecommendations to advance the&#13;
  strategic framework for strong nationalprograms and an efficient andoperational&#13;
  regional network. The review panel should strive to identify constraints impeding&#13;
  establishment o f long-term risk andcost-sharing mechanisms, related national and&#13;
  regionalpolicies, and the supporting and complementary role o f the donor community.&#13;
  30. It i s clear that not all countries canjustify a long-term investment ina national locust&#13;
  program, but establishment o f a regional network could play a crucial role indeveloping&#13;
  improvedpolicies, early warning systems, contingency plans, and control strategies&#13;
  linked to environmental impact assessments. However, the sustainability o f such a&#13;
  regionalnetwork hinges on the commitment o fmember countries to long-term financing&#13;
  through cost sharing, complementedwith a sound fimdraising strategy and an&#13;
  international andor regional `emergency fimd' or calamity insurance for severe cases, be&#13;
  it locusts or birdinfestationsor drought.&#13;

111.    ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTASSESSMENT&#13;
31,A fill-scale economic analysis o fthe project would be very difficult at this stage and&#13;
has not been attempted. Indeed, there are no reliable estimates o f (i) magnitude o fthe&#13;
                                                                        the&#13;
actual and projectedinfestations andtheir impact onproduction and affectedpopulations;&#13;
and (ii)the cost to eradicate the infestationor measures to mitigate its impact. Estimated&#13;
project costs include important physical contingencies, and project activities will need to&#13;
beadjusted onthe basis o factual needs anddevelopments onthe ground (as trackedby&#13;
the M&amp;Esystem that willbe established at the beginningofthe program). Thus, only a&#13;
general qualitative discussion i s presented below.&#13;
32. The potential benefits o fthe project (the losses avoided as a result o fthe project) fall&#13;
into three main categories:&#13;
&#13;
0   benefits o f the proposed emergency control and eradication measures;&#13;
0   benefits o f the proposed strengthening o f countries' surveillance andprevention&#13;
    capacities; and&#13;
0   benefits from the proposedmeasures to provide assistanceto the affectedpopulations.&#13;
These three main categories are discussed intuminthe paragraphs below.&#13;
&#13;
EconomicJustificationof ControlMeasures&#13;
33. The potential benefits o f control measures are the losses that will be avoided. Future&#13;
losses depend on the likelihood andmagnitude of new outbreaks that cannot be&#13;
determinedwith any degree o f certainty. Inaddition, should they occur, their impact on&#13;
the vegetative cover is very difficult to estimate. Indeed, physical (andmonetary)&#13;
estimates are very difficult to obtain. Because o fthe nature o f the swarms, losses are&#13;
unevenly distributed inspace andtime, even within affected areas. Where swarms do not&#13;
land, losses do not occur. Where swarms do land, however, losses canbe total within&#13;
hours at the local level. The level o f losses is also highly dependent on a number o f&#13;
variables, including the number o f insects, how long they stay inthe area, plant species,&#13;
and the stage o f crop development. Interms o f control strategies, the efficacy, efficiency,&#13;
and equitability o f locust control programs are undocumented or rely largely on anecdotal&#13;
information. While insecticides undoubtedlykillinsects and canprotect standing crops,&#13;
their ability to end or prevent plagues is not clear.&#13;
34. Despite all these limitations, a crude costbenefit analysis can be attempted to provide&#13;
roughjustification for proposedcontrol measures. The cost o f spraying a hectare has been&#13;
estimated at US$15. The average price o f a ton o f cereal i s about US$140. If the average&#13;
cereal productivity were 1ton/ha (which i s close to the world average in2000), then the&#13;
costbenefit ratio would be about 10, suggesting an amplypositive strategy. However,&#13;
thishasto be qualified on several grounds:&#13;
&#13;
0   The average cereal productivity inthe selected countries is below 1tonha, varying&#13;
    from as low as 300 k g h a inpart o fNiger to over 1,000 k g h a inSenegal, for an&#13;
    estimated average o f 500 kgha.&#13;
0   Evenwithin an affected area, it is estimated that crop losses are not 100percent, but&#13;
    intherange of50percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
0   Finally, given the extreme uncertainty o fthe area attacked, the area sprayed i s&#13;
    significantly greater than the area actually affected, ingeneral estimated to be twice&#13;
    as large.&#13;
&#13;
35. Onthat basis, the costhenefit ratio o f control operations would be marginally positive&#13;
at about 1to 2. This estimate is inlinewith a USAID analysis o f the efforts innine&#13;
African countries in 1986which yieldeda return o f 1to 1,leading the assessment team to&#13;
conclude that "the cost-effectiveness of the locust and grasshoppers controlprograms&#13;
has not been demonstrated. .    ."&#13;
&#13;
36. This analysis needs to be qualified by several considerations that have conflicting&#13;
effects on the justification for control campaigns. On the negative side, insecticide&#13;
spraying has a cost interms o fhealth and environmental impact that i s difficult to&#13;
quantifybutwhich isnot insignificant. Onthe positive side, estimates o fthe benefits&#13;
based only on direct crop losses clearly underestimate the true cost o f the disasters. Some&#13;
additional considerations include:&#13;
&#13;
0   direct andindirect losses inthe livestock sector (mortality, reducedweight, conflicts&#13;
    due to early migration);&#13;
0   permanent loss o fproductive assets/capacity that will have negative effects on fbture&#13;
    production;&#13;
0   effects on general consumer prices for food andanimal feed;&#13;
    second-round effects o freduced agricultural incomes on the rural economy and the&#13;
    broader economy incountries which are heavily dependant o f agriculture; and&#13;
0   the long-term negative effects on general economic activity as a result o fthe&#13;
    reallocation o f scarce private andpublic resources to emergency control activities,&#13;
    and the loss o fhuman and social capital.&#13;
&#13;
37. Onthe whole it would seem that a more inclusive costhenefit analysis considering&#13;
most indirect andsecond-round effects would strengthen the economic justification o f&#13;
control activities. The analysis also suggests that while large-scale control programs may&#13;
have only limited economicjustification, more targeted control programs that focus on&#13;
areas plantedto high-value crops andthat when sprayed accurately may have a much&#13;
higher costhenefit ratio andjustification.&#13;
EconomicJustificationof Early Warning andPreventionSystems&#13;
38. Economic studies o f desert locust control efforts are surprisingly scarce despite the&#13;
considerable amount o f public hnds investedbythe concerned countries and the&#13;
international community, and the seriousness o f locust outbreaks on economic growth&#13;
andpoverty. The available data suggest that desert locusts do not ingeneral represent a&#13;
serious threat. Crop losses caused by locusts at a national level, and across time, are&#13;
generally small comparedto losses from other pests and natural disasters. Estimates o f&#13;
the potential losses from anuncontrolled desert locust upsurge do not exceed 5-7 percent&#13;
o fproduction inany given year (research inthe Sahelian rainfed sorghum andmilletbelt&#13;
suggests that grasshoppers ingeneral cause more regular and chronic losses than do&#13;
locusts). It also suggests that desert locusts are unlikelyto trigger widespread food&#13;
insecurity, although they can and do cause localizedproblems when affected&#13;
communities are already vulnerable. Most available technical studies are generally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
skeptical about the benefit-cost ratios o f existing locust prevention strategies, while&#13;
recognizing that the threat to commercial agriculture i s a more important factor.&#13;
39. One o f the available studies (Joffe, 1998) presents a preliminary analysis o fprevious&#13;
upsurges and control and mitigation programs, and concludes that:&#13;
    The economic impact o f locust infestations depends on the extent o fthe infestation&#13;
    and the affected farming systems.&#13;
    Only severe and wide-spread infestations are likely to have an impact on overall&#13;
    national production and food security, although affected areas can suffer drastic and&#13;
    sometime total losses.&#13;
    Effective surveillance andcontrol mechanisms can prevent or drastically reduce most&#13;
    damage from locust outbreaks.&#13;
    Consideredindividually, because ofthe longremissionperiods between outbreaks, in&#13;
    most countries the economic justification o fmaintaining such a permanent&#13;
    surveillance and control mechanism appears doubtful.&#13;
    Such systems appearjustified only for countries which are at highrisk for major and&#13;
    frequent outbreaks (front-line countries) and/or countries that have intensive, high-&#13;
    value agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
40. However, preliminary estimates (CIRAD, September 2004) appear to indicate that the&#13;
failure to act immediately anddecisively to immediately suppress the upsurge was&#13;
responsible for the dramatic increase inboththe cost of eradication and social and&#13;
economic impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Evolution of the Outbreak and Control Cost Escalation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41. This would tend to demonstrate that investmentsinmaintaining a satisfactory early&#13;
warning system would have avery highpay-offcompared to the costs. Finally, the&#13;
dynamics o f the current upsurgedemonstrate that becauseo f the regional nature o f locust&#13;
invasions, an efficient prevention and early response mechanism would require closely&#13;
coordinated collective action at a regional level. Such coordination would be necessary to&#13;
avoid successive infestations because the concerned countries failed to quickly suppress&#13;
the outbreak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Benefitsof MitigationMeasuresfor AffectedPopulations&#13;
42. Justificationof ProposedAssistance to AffectedPopulations.Although the&#13;
number of rural households already affected by the current upsurge has not yet been&#13;
estimated, it is already apparent that this number i s highandwill probably increase inthe&#13;
coming months with successive re-infestations that are likely to occur untilfinally&#13;
eradicated. A simple multiplication o fthe area thought to havebeen infestedby the&#13;
average rural population density, as providedby the World Development Indicators&#13;
(2000), would indicate that more than 2 millionpeople may already have been directly&#13;
affectedbythe locust invasion inseven countries (500,000 inSenegal, 350,000 in&#13;
Mauritania, 500,000 inMali, and200,000 inNiger). Many are affectedto a degree&#13;
beyond their traditional risk-copingmechanisms. Such damage, inaddition to the major&#13;
economic shock it represents for already fragile economies heavily dependant on&#13;
agriculture, would also be a major set-back for overall poverty reduction because it would&#13;
predominantly affect the most vulnerable segments o fthe population. Although an&#13;
accurate estimate o f the damage incurred by these populations i s not yet known, the&#13;
justification o f associated mitigation measures is not questioned, rather the question i s&#13;
generally one o fhow to implement such measures on a least-cost basis).&#13;
43. Needfor PublicAction for Risk Management.Along with violent conflicts, natural&#13;
disasters are a major cause o f economic stagnation andvulnerability inAfrica, causing&#13;
suddencollapse o fnational output andsharp increases inpoverty. Poor households are&#13;
highlyvulnerable to negative shocks, whether they behealth, natural, policy-induced.&#13;
Most have limited human, financial, physical, or social assets to cope with fluctuations in&#13;
their income. Inparticular, heavyrelianceon agriculture exposes them to highlevels of&#13;
natural risks from climate andplant and animal pests. Inaddition, natural disasters place&#13;
all sources o f agricultural household income injeopardy because most income i s closely&#13;
tied to farming. Thus, even households with a well-diversified incomeportfolio are still&#13;
vulnerable to natural disasters.&#13;
44. Many rural households rely on informal mechanisms to cope with risk based on their&#13;
financial andphysical capital (monetary and other savings, livestock) or social capital&#13;
(family and communitynetworks). However, these mechanisms, ifthey work for&#13;
idiosyncratic shocks, fail under a protracted crisis -such as the impact o f HIV/AIDS -&#13;
or a severe event involvingcovariate risk such as most natural disasters. Finally, most o f&#13;
these informal mechanisms are not available to the poorest households that have few&#13;
assets and are based on reciprocity. Lack o f adequate risk mitigation mechanisms initiates&#13;
a downward spiral inwhich actions to cope with the immediate crisis further reduce their&#13;
ability to generate income and manage risk inthe long-term. They are thus forced to use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and sell whatever productive assets they own, which inturnreduces their income eaming&#13;
capacity inthe future and locks them ina poverty trap.&#13;
45. It i s imperative for governments to quickly addressthe negative effects o fnatural&#13;
disasters on agriculture for economic as well as social reasons. Inmost African countries&#13;
agricultural growth has a strong multiplier effect on the rest o fthe economy (the non-&#13;
farm economy grows at about the same rate as the farm economy). Therefore the impact&#13;
of a reduction inagricultural production has an immediate impact on the entire national&#13;
economy. Reducedproductive agricultural assets, ifnot addressed quickly, also&#13;
reverberate for several years throughout the entire regional economy. Finally, highlevels&#13;
o frisk also constrain agricultural households from engaging into a low-risWlow-retum&#13;
investment strategy that prevents them from increasingproductivity andincome. Not&#13;
only are agricultural households kept from accumulating the assets that would improve&#13;
their risk management capacity, but their dilemma also has a severe negative impact on&#13;
overall economic growth.&#13;
46. Naturalrisk management must thus be a critical part o f a government poverty&#13;
reduction strategy. Cumulative experience clearly indicates that investinginprevention&#13;
andpreparedness insteado freconstructionisjustified from an economic point o fview.&#13;
Finally, the lack o f effective risk management instruments inrural households affects&#13;
agricultural income and the overall economy andpoverty. Governments clearly play a&#13;
critical role inproviding risk mitigation and safety net systems. Inthe long-term, market&#13;
mechanisms manage some market-related risks and some natural disasters risks&#13;
(insurance) andmay grow inimportance, although they are currently largely under-&#13;
developed and unavailable ina large part o f the developing world. Public action is&#13;
necessary not only to provide poor households with income opportunities -supporting&#13;
their accumulation of human, financial, physical, and social assets and increasing their&#13;
ability to cope with risk -but also to lessen their vulnerability to adverse shocks.&#13;
&#13;
IV.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
PesticideManagement&#13;
47. The hazards o fpoor pesticide management have beenknown for years, but few&#13;
African countries have made significant efforts to address the problem. There i s now&#13;
widespread support for concerted action as reflected inthe recommendations o f several&#13;
African regional workshops -the      Inter-government Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS),&#13;
the First Continental Conference for Africa onthe sound management o fhazardous waste&#13;
held inRabat duringJanuary 2001,andthe adoption o f the Rabat Declaration bythe&#13;
African Conference o f Ministers o f Environment inJuly 2002. However, because locust&#13;
invasions are fast moving, regional, andrequire continuous surveillance, early warning,&#13;
and rapid action at the national andregional levels, there is an urgentneed to develop a&#13;
coherent regional framework o f action for more efficient locust control management.&#13;
48. There are two primaryinstitutional issues: capacity and strategies.&#13;
49. Lack of Adequate Technical, Institutional,andFinancialCapacity.Few Sahelian&#13;
countries are currently equipped to prevent and react quickly to threatened locust&#13;
invasions. Because o f the long remissionperiods between upsurges, many countries fail&#13;
to maintain eventhe minimumcapacity necessaryto implement soundprevention&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
practices. Inparticular, many countries lack sufficient early warning anddecision-making&#13;
systems, have inadequate storage andstock management, and a lack the training and&#13;
education required for appropriate pesticide use. There i s also widespread misuse o f&#13;
pesticides as a result o fpoor access to safety equipment, lack o fwarnings inlocal&#13;
languages, and often low levels o f education among primary users.&#13;
50. InadequateProcurementStrategies.Inadequate procurement strategies by&#13;
governments, national agencies, donor agencies, development organizations, and others&#13;
are the principal cause o f risks from oversupply o fpesticides, supply o f unsuitable&#13;
products, late delivery o fproducts, and supply ininappropriatepackage sizes. There is a&#13;
need to improve pesticide management from the point o f supplyto the point o f use and&#13;
beyond interms of, storage management, and disposal o f empty containers and unused&#13;
pesticides.&#13;
51.The major environmentalrisksrelatedto locust control derive from:&#13;
    inadequate pesticide management practices duringlocust invasions;&#13;
    unsuitable products or packaging, including poor product specifications,&#13;
    unavailability of required application equipment, labels inforeign languages, lack o f&#13;
    trained personnel, etc.;&#13;
    donation or purchase inexcess o fneed that can result inproducts that have&#13;
    deteriorated during storage&#13;
    lack o f coordination among donor agencies so there may be duplicative, unsolicited,&#13;
    andor excessive donations;&#13;
    inadequate storage and strategic stock management, degradation o fpesticides that&#13;
    have a limitedshelf life andthat is further shortened by improper storage conditions&#13;
    (strategic stocks that are kept for emergencies become obsolete ifnot rotated&#13;
    properly); and&#13;
    commercial andor entrepreneurial interests override good management so there may&#13;
    be over-estimate o f needs, inappropriate product supply, or corruption).&#13;
&#13;
52. Poor pesticide management can have detrimental effects on health, natural resources&#13;
andbiodiversity, and the economy.&#13;

&#13;
53. PreventionandMitigationMeasures.Efforts have beenmade inrecent years to&#13;
improve pesticide management inmany African countries, including increased use o f&#13;
IntegratedPest Management (IPM)when applicable, andregulatory development (in&#13;
particular the technical directives from the 8th Locust Pesticide Referee Group&#13;
recommending a list o fproducts with minimalnegative environmental impact when&#13;
transported, stored, andused correctly). Despite this positive development, Sahelian&#13;
countries need to increase efforts to preventmisuse and/or overuse o fpesticides in ajoint&#13;
effort with all concemed stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and&#13;
intemational andnational agencies, inparticular inemergency locust control situations.&#13;
54. Prevention activities to be initiated underAELP fall into two broad categories -&#13;
pesticidemanagementto ensure that locust controlpesticides are managedinways that&#13;
prevent or mitigate associated risks, andpromotionof alternativesto chemical&#13;
pesticides.&#13;
55. PesticideManagement-Procurement,Transport,Storage,and Use. AELP will&#13;
address these issues andutilize stakeholder committees to tailor procurement to specific&#13;
needs and eliminate supply-driven pesticide procurement, a major cause o f over-supply.&#13;
The active involvement o fthe donor community inthe AELP partnershipwill also help&#13;
prevent oversupply. Transport and storage (inparticular for security stocks) will be&#13;
consistent with the relevant intemational agreements and standards. Ifnecessary, steps&#13;
will betaken to upgrade storage facilities to meet proper standards. Inaddition, for each&#13;
nationalproject there is a need to develop a strategy andmechanism for safe collection or&#13;
safe disposal o f old containers. The current situation varies greatly from country to&#13;
country. Insome cases, national systems to deal with hazardous waste are being&#13;
established and locust control pesticide containers will be dealt with under such systems.&#13;
Inother countries, astudyofsuitable, available technologies is neededto identifyproper&#13;
management, including defining the role o fthe private sector. FA0has produced&#13;
guidance on this subject andwill help countries explore options and develop solutions&#13;
most appropriate to their situations. Appropriate guidance will be also provided by the&#13;
relevant technical assistance to be financed under AELP.&#13;
56. Promotionof Alternatives. Inaddition, ifpesticide treatment is still the only&#13;
possible action duringemergencies, insufficient attention i s currently givento alternative&#13;
approaches to locust control duringperiods o fremission (see Locust Control Alternatives&#13;
below). Collaborative research and development programs to support locust control using&#13;
bio-pesticides are needed.&#13;
57. RemainingRisks andRelatedMitigationMeasures.Although AELP is aiming to&#13;
preventmassive locust invasions, there will always remain a needto undertake&#13;
preventivetreatments duringremissionsperiods inspecific breeding areas where there is&#13;
an endemic presence o f desert locust. These areas are small, usually between 20 and 200&#13;
hectares (mostly pastures and to a lesser extent gardens) scattered throughout arid areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
with a very low populationdensity (less than 0.5 inhabitantiha). Observations duringthe&#13;
last decade have shown very few negative impacts from these prevention treatments for&#13;
the following reasons: (i) the livingorganisms inthese areas have an extreme adaptive&#13;
andresilience capacity, (ii) there is a rapid degradation o fpesticides as a consequence o f&#13;
hightemperatures andintense sunny conditions, and(iii) preventive treatments are&#13;
                                                            the&#13;
not applied inthe same areas over consecutive seasons.&#13;
58. To minimize these risks, all proposed pest management activities inbreeding areas&#13;
duringremissionperiodswill be carefully executed, inparticular training o flocust&#13;
control field staff on storage management, transport, and treatment, and local public&#13;
awareness.&#13;
PesticideManagementMonitoringIndicators&#13;
59. The following indicators will beused to illustrate evidence o f improved pesticide&#13;
management:&#13;
    The government has established a strategy, policies, andprocedures related to safe&#13;
    management o f locust control pesticides,&#13;
    The government is committing resources/funds to improve locust control&#13;
    management,&#13;
    There i s a mechanism inplace for disposal o f obsolete locust control pesticides and&#13;
    chemical containers,&#13;
    Nobannedlocust control pesticides/products are imported,&#13;
    Storage facilities meet quality standards set forth by the program,&#13;
    Existence o f a Locust Control Emergency Committee to coordinate government and&#13;
    donor efforts for pesticide management, inparticular pesticide procurement,&#13;
    A regional early warning system is inplace andfunctions inan efficient manner, and&#13;
    Regional collaborative research anddevelopment programs are being undertakento&#13;
    develop and transfer alternative locust control techniques.&#13;
&#13;
Considerationsfor PesticideProcurement&#13;
60. The Bankrequiresthat anypesticides it finances be manufactured, packaged, labeled,&#13;
handled, stored, disposed of, and appliedaccordingto standards acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The FA0 Technical Guidelines for the implementation o f the International Code o f&#13;
Conduct for the Distribution andUse o fPesticides serves as the main reference (see&#13;
section on Resources for links to these documents). Manyproblems associatedwith&#13;
pesticide use originate because specifications intenders andprocurement documents are&#13;
missing.&#13;
61. Several safeguards can be built inat the stage o f procurement. Such documents&#13;
should not only specify the products but also their packaging type, size and durability.&#13;
The tender canrequirethat the pesticide supplier also supply protective gear, Material&#13;
Safety Data Sheets, training inproper handling anduse, antidotes, etc.&#13;
62. The tender should also make explicit that the supplier is obliged to take back, at its&#13;
own expense, products that uponarrival do not to conform to the specifications. Insome&#13;
cases, suppliers may agree to take back products that remain unused after a specified&#13;
period o ftime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63. Checklistfor Procurementof Pesticides.The tender/procurement documents&#13;
should include:&#13;
&#13;
e   Active ingredient&#13;
0    Formulation&#13;
e    Container type and size&#13;
e    Packagingtype&#13;
e    Labeling (language, standards)&#13;
e    Dates (production, expiration, shelf life)&#13;
e    Other items to be considered inthe procurement document (supplier's obligations):&#13;
e    Take back products deviating from specifications&#13;
e    Provide Material Safety Data Sheets&#13;
e    Provision to take back left-over products&#13;
e    Provide `certificate o f country o f origin' for the product&#13;
&#13;
64. PreventingProductsfromBecomingObsolete.FA0 Guidelines for the Prevention&#13;
o f Accumulation o f Obsolete Pesticide Stocks recommend that for centrally organized&#13;
pest control programs, such as vector control, locust, and other migratory pest control&#13;
programs, the quantities o fpesticides should not exceed a one-year requirement, nor&#13;
should these exceed the capacity to store, transport, or apply the product. Storage&#13;
capacity is determined by the availability o f storage space inadequate pesticides stores.&#13;
Application capacity i s determinedby the available application equipment, availability o f&#13;
staff to use the equipment, andtransportation to bring staff and products to the location&#13;
where applicationis needed. Exceeding any o fthese capacities is likely to leadto&#13;
obsolete pesticide stocks.&#13;
65. The following checklist aims to help avoid mistakes that have contributedto the&#13;
accumulation o f obsolete pesticide stocks. It should be anticipated that the Bank&#13;
eventually may be heldresponsible for obsolete pesticides that were procuredwith Bank&#13;
loans andthat could have been avoided bybetter assessment and specification o f&#13;
requirements.&#13;
&#13;
0    I s the product registered for use inthe country?2&#13;
0    I s the formulation suitable for the application equipment?&#13;
e    I s the quantity consistent with the capacity to store the product?&#13;
     I s the quantity based on an accurate assessment o f needs?&#13;
e    Have existing stocks beentaken into consideration?&#13;
e    Are there any economic or other factors that may slow down the sale/distribution o f&#13;
     the product concerned (e.g., abolishment o f subsidies; changes insupply/distribution&#13;
     systems)?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
________~&#13;
        ~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. The Bank rarely requires a specific positive or negative list, but generally reviews and&#13;
accepts (with or without changes) the approvedcertified list o f `registered' pesticides&#13;
used inthat country (because most countries follow WHO, EU, FAO, and other&#13;
international rules). However, the Bank does require safeguards: certified&#13;
applicatordfarm workers; safety gear; storage etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Are containers durable enough to withstandanticipated transport, handling, and&#13;
    storage conditions?&#13;
0   Are containers o f an appropriate size for the envisaged use?&#13;
&#13;
66. Pointsfor SpecialAttention. Inaddition, the following points will receive specific&#13;
attention:&#13;
&#13;
0   Donor coordination-insome cases, inadequate donor coordination has ledto&#13;
    excessive supplies o fpesticides under declared emergency situations. Such excessive&#13;
    stocks are likely to contribute to the build-upo f obsolete pesticides.&#13;
    Small consignments -consider supply insmall consignments spread over time or&#13;
    the concept of a `pesticide bank' to reduce the risk o fbuild-upo f stocks. New&#13;
    consignments should only be released upon confirmation that earlier consignments&#13;
    are being depleted at the anticipated rate.&#13;
    Changes -further training of users may berequiredifproducts or formulations&#13;
    change.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
LocustControlAlternatives&#13;
68. New InstitutionalArrangements. To improve future locust management, there i s a&#13;
need to shift to an IPM-based strategy that considers the population dynamics o f the pest.&#13;
The present strategy i s based on chemical control for bothprevention and control. An&#13;
PM-based strategy would exploit natural mortality factors and consider new control&#13;
alternatives. Alternative techniques being developed such as insect growth regulators,&#13;
botanicals, semiochemicals, andbiopesticides would be considered. Although there&#13;
already i s a substantial body o f research on the entomology andbiotopes o f locusts, their&#13;
predators, and population dynamics, there i s a need to expand this knowledge and&#13;
develop new andmore efficient control instruments. This i s a long-term endeavor that&#13;
requires long-term financing and a critical mass o f scientists that does not exist inany&#13;
single Sahelian country. There i s also a need to launch short-term adaptive research and&#13;
transfer programs focusing on spray technologies.&#13;
69. Collaborative strategic and research anddevelopment (R&amp;D) programs for locust&#13;
management shouldbe undertakenthrough the national agricultural research systems&#13;
(NARS) (including universities) inclose collaboration with the centers o fthe&#13;
Consultative Group on InternationalAgricultural Research (CGIAR) and advanced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
research institutions. It is recommended that centers o f excellence be identified among&#13;
the participating NARSs as the focal point for this collaborative effort. Inaddition, given&#13;
the specificity o f locust control strategies to prevent breeding and swarming andmassive&#13;
control intervention, a strategic plano f action for locust management R&amp;D, as well as a&#13;
related set o f techniques for each stage andlevel o f intervention, should be developed,&#13;
adapted, and transferred.&#13;
Lines of Research for Locust Control Alternatives&#13;
69. A financial provisionhas been earmarked for each AELP country for this purpose.&#13;
The mainlines o fresearchinclude alternative control instruments, biological solutions,&#13;
population dynamics, and risk and damage assessment.&#13;
70. Alternative control instruments:&#13;
    Insect growth regulators (e.g., Diflubenzuron and Triflumuron) interfere with the&#13;
    production o f chitin and insect metamorphosis. IGRs are persistent, have low&#13;
    environmental impact, and are selective due to stomach action.&#13;
    Phenylpyrazoles (e.g., Fipronil) are persistent andthe formulation has low&#13;
    mammalian toxicity andi s a stomach andcontact poison.&#13;
    Chloronicotinyls (e.g., Imidacloprid) formulations already have low mammalian&#13;
    toxicity and are a stomach and contact poison.&#13;
    Botanical insecticides (e.g., neem) are available locally andcanbe prepared at the&#13;
    village level insmall quantities that have a low environmental impact.&#13;
    Semiochemicals (e.g., pheromones) maybe highly specific and safe products that can&#13;
    be usedto disperse bands and swarms. Experimental results on reduced feeding,&#13;
    marching, increasedpredation, cannibalism, and susceptibility to insecticides and&#13;
    pathogens are encouraging. None are available commercially. The International&#13;
    Center o f Insect Physiology andEcology (ICIPE) has identified an environment-&#13;
    friendly, specific and cost-effective agent, the locust pheromonephenylacetonitrile&#13;
    (PAN). Spraying larvae with the pheromonehas a lasting impact ontheir&#13;
    development andbehavior. Ifit i s mixed with other insecticides, the efficacy at these&#13;
    insecticides i s increased by a factor o ften to fifteen.&#13;
    Biopesticides (e.g., Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum) are highly specific, have&#13;
    low mammaliantoxicity, and are safe for the environment. There are few production&#13;
    facilities on the African continent that could produce the formulation locally.&#13;
&#13;
71. Biological Solution. Various research programs and inparticular the LUBILOSA&#13;
project (Lutte BIologique contre les Locustes et Sauteriaux) investigatedbiological&#13;
means o f controlling locusts and grasshoppers. A mycopesticide called GREEN&#13;
MUSCLE@is based on the spores o f the insect pathogenic fungus M anisopliae var.&#13;
acridum. This fungus, which appears to be specific to species o f short-horned&#13;
grasshoppers, i s widely distributedinAfrica andunder favorable climatic conditions, can&#13;
cause local epidemics ingrasshopper or locust populations. Its biological and physical&#13;
properties make this fungus an ideal candidate for biological control. Spores o fM.&#13;
anisopliae var. acridum can be easily mass-produced.&#13;
72.    The efficacy o f GREENW S C L E O has been demonstrated inmany field trials&#13;
carried out over the past ten years, including aerial application at an operational scale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
GREENMUSCLE@isbeingrecommended bythe pesticide referee group o fFAO. In&#13;
South Africa the product was launched inMarch 1998, andhas beenregistered. GREEN&#13;
MUSCLE@was registered for the Sahel in2001. Niger launched GREENMUSCLE@in&#13;
August 2000 andis the first country which integrated GREENMUSCLE@into its&#13;
grasshopper control operations. GREENMUSCLE@production i s also being developed&#13;
inSenegal.&#13;
73.    However, just launching the product will not necessarily leadto the required scale&#13;
o f adoption. A modest transfer program i s therefore neededto ensure the large-scale&#13;
uptake o fMetarhizium. This will involve activities to develop boththe supply and&#13;
demandsides o fthe economic equation. Onthe supplyside, the objectives are to help&#13;
production companies incase o fproblems andto advertise the availability o f Green&#13;
Muscle. The demandside includes stimulating demandby information, publicity, and&#13;
advocacy, and developing integrateduse strategies that capitalize on the particular&#13;
properties o fMetarhizium. Inaddition, inorder to succeedthe program needs to have an&#13;
enabling legal and fiscal environment that would help promote the use o fbio-pesticides.&#13;
74.    PopulationDynamics.An IPM-based strategy is dependent on a clear&#13;
understanding o fpest population dynamics andtheir interactionwith the ecosystem and&#13;
management actions. The present early warning system relies on weather forecasting and&#13;
satellite imaging o fvegetation cover. However, the present early warning systems does&#13;
not integrate population dynamics data with weather and vegetation data to produce&#13;
powerful simulation models that could beusedto monitor and apply decision tools.&#13;
75.    Risk andDamageAssessment.Crop loss assessmentfor locust invasions is avery&#13;
complex endeavor. Experts often disagree on the most appropriate and cost-effective&#13;
protocols for systematic crop loss assessments. Cost-effective methodologies and&#13;
protocols for a rapid assessment o f locust damage are desperately neededto get a clear&#13;
understanding of the impacts o f locust invasions.&#13;
76.    The project would support:&#13;
&#13;
0    a review o f existing technologies;&#13;
0    the development o fa Locust Control ResearchMedium-Term Strategic Plan,&#13;
     including efficient institutional arrangements for carrying out and fimding&#13;
     collaborative research programs, and;&#13;
0    priority adaptive research andtransfer programs. For this purpose financial provision&#13;
     havebeen earmarked for each AELP country.&#13;
&#13;
V.       PROJECTADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Responsibilityfor Implementation&#13;
77.    The country projects will be implementedthrough existing institutions andusedto&#13;
strengthen the national institutional framework ineach country. The ministries incharge&#13;
o f locust/pest control will inmost cases be responsible for project implementation. The&#13;
project i s multisectoral andwill be implementedunder the guidance o fthe Inter-&#13;
Ministerial Locust Control Committee, which will include representatives from all&#13;
stakeholders andcivil society. A project coordinator will be appointed to manage and&#13;
coordinate the activities o fthe project. The project coordinator will be responsible for (i)&#13;
preparing detailed implementation plans andbudgets, (ii)    discussingthese plans and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
budgets with participating donors, (iii) supervisingimplementation activities, (iv)&#13;
coordinating with regional institutions, and(v) andreporting on the use o f resources and&#13;
results achieved.&#13;
78.    The project coordinator will beresponsible for coordinatingthe support o f all&#13;
external donors, ensuring coherence and transparency inthe use o f all available&#13;
resources, and for timely and accurate reporting. The responsibilities and accountability&#13;
of the project coordinator will be detailed ina performance contract agreed upon with the&#13;
Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee. The draft terms o f reference and&#13;
performance contract o f the project coordinator will be presented inthe Project&#13;
Implementation Plan(PIE').&#13;
79.    The financial management and procurement activities will be managed by the&#13;
financial and administrative unit o f on-going IDA-financed projects according to&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA. These Project implementationunits are already assessed&#13;
for capacity by the Bank's procurement and financial management specialists.&#13;
80.    Participation and Targeting. Localcommunities/populations will be closely&#13;
associated with planning, implementation, andmonitoring. For the implementation o f&#13;
individual activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners as well as&#13;
with institutions inother countries andrelevantregional institutions to determine how&#13;
proposed collective actions may affect the region. This is especially important for the&#13;
proposed research program andregional natural risk management strategy. Particular&#13;
attentionwill be givento the detailedmechanism for targeting project assistance to&#13;
affected populations and to monitoring efficient delivery. The detailed PIP, including the&#13;
detailed targeting system M&amp;E will be agreed upon and established at the beginning o f&#13;
project.&#13;
81. The project i s part o f governments' overall locust emergency management&#13;
programs, andhas been designedon the basis o f available information andbest estimates&#13;
about the future evolution o fthe infestation andits impact on agricultural communities.&#13;
Relative emphasis among components andrelated funding requirements will need to be&#13;
regularly adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on the ground and additional&#13;
financial resources that may become available. The project coordinator will prepare&#13;
detailed programs, budgets, and financing plans every six months for discussionwith the&#13;
Program Steering Committee and donors funding government programs.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
82.    The fiduciary arrangement o fthe project will be handledby an existing agency in&#13;
each country so the project can benefit from their experience inmanaging IDA funds.&#13;
83.    The financial management assessmentsidentified areas for each country that need&#13;
to be strengthened, including staffing, accountingpolicies andprocedures, external&#13;
audits, etc.&#13;
84.    The financial management arrangements for each country are included inthe&#13;

VI.       M&amp;E, RESULTSFRAMEWORK, RISKS, AND SUPERVISION&#13;
91.     The Africa Emergency Locust Project will bean integral part o fthe national&#13;
programs undertaken by eachparticipating country (Country Comprehensive Locust&#13;
Program, CCLP). Inaddition, the project will support the collective action necessary at a&#13;
regional level to eradicate the outbreak. The project M&amp;E system will thus include two&#13;
related components: (i)series of country-specific M&amp;E systems; and (ii) M&amp;E&#13;
                               a                                                          an&#13;
system for regional activities.&#13;
92.     AELP will set up a monitoring and evaluation system ineach country. Each&#13;
Government will create a NationalLocustProgramsCoordinationCommittee&#13;
(NLPCC) that will oversee activities and funding (including bank-funded AELP) o f the&#13;
above-mentioned programs. Specific responsibilities o f the committee will include&#13;
approval o f annual work programs, budgets, and related adjustments. The committee will&#13;
include representatives from relevant technical services (agriculture, environment, health,&#13;
etc.) and civil society (producer organizations, representative associations, andNGOs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93.   The country M&amp;Eswould include at least the following core elements: (i)         agreed-&#13;
uponperformance indicators (see project result framework); (ii)       information sources and&#13;
methodology for data collection, and (iii)   information disclosure and communicationplan&#13;
(contents, channels, frequency, and format). The country's NLPCC will own this system,&#13;
which will be refined as part o fthe project along with all relevant partners, including&#13;
donors. It i s hoped that all partners will fklly participate inthis system, and that the&#13;
monitoring, evaluation, and reporting burdenwill be reduced so that countries can focus&#13;
their efforts on locust control. All informationrelated to use o f national and foreign&#13;
contributions to the nationalprogram would be captured and disclosed every fortnight&#13;
according to a predefined format.&#13;
94.   The ProjectCoordinationUnitwill be responsible for the overall management o f&#13;
the M&amp;Es that would be designed soon after project effectiveness andnot later than three&#13;
months following this date. A scorecard approach will be designed andusedto assess&#13;
overall country project/program effectiveness. Specific methods will be identified to&#13;
measure pesticide-related environmental impact. The results framework below provides&#13;
the common indicators that each country will use.&#13;

&#13;
97.    A regionalM&amp;Esystem willbe designed for these activities andaggregate relevant&#13;
country-specific parameters inorder to permit efficient collective action. CLCPRO,&#13;
created with the technical support o fFAO, has been suggested as the most suitable&#13;
institution to ensure project coordination at the regional level. The Conference o f&#13;
Agriculture Ministers on Desert Locust held on August 30 and 31,2004 inDakar&#13;
(Senegal) recommendedto       ". . . strengthen the regional coordinationmechanismthrough&#13;
CLCPRO for the celerity, the transparency, and the efficiency o f interventions."&#13;
CLCPRO shouldbe mandated bymember countries to carry out this coordinationrole&#13;
and strengthened to acquire the necessary capacity. Its executive secretary shouldbe&#13;
responsible for coordination. M&amp;E, and reporting on regional project activities.&#13;
98.    Inaddition, anindependentpanelwillbeappointedfor overallprogram efficiency&#13;
and impact assessment at the regional andcountry levels. Particular attentionwould be&#13;
givento the management, use, andimpact o fpesticides, as well as resource mobilization&#13;
andtransparency inusingthem. This panelwouldbe composed o fpeople from one&#13;
international NGO andone CGIAR institutionmember. The financing o f such a panel&#13;
should come from resources other than those o fthe locust programs to preserve its&#13;
independence.&#13;
ProjectSupervision&#13;
99.    At the national level, a coordination committee as outlined inthe country&#13;
summaries will supervise the project. These committees will ensure that the activities o f&#13;
the project are an integral part o fthe Countries Comprehensive Locust Program (CCLP).&#13;
The M&amp;Esystem described above will be used for this purpose.&#13;
 100. From the World Bank, the project will be supervised at two levels. At the country&#13;
level, AELP country focal points that are ESSD staff will undertakethe day-to-day&#13;
supervision. The financial management specialist andprocurement specialist will assist&#13;
them. FromHeadquarters, the Task Team Leader will be assisted by a co-TTL, possibly&#13;
seconded from abilateral aid organization. The Bank team is dispersed andwill be&#13;
strengthened through systematic teambuildingexercises launched initially with the help&#13;
o f a team coach and start-up activities and frequent information exchange.&#13;
 101. Relativeto other projects, this supervisionbudget may seemhigh.However, a&#13;
sustained and consistent effort is requiredbecause seven countries are involved, a weak&#13;
institutional framework needs to be strengthened duringproject implementation, and&#13;
there i s a highrisk to the Bank's reputation from inadequate implementation support. The&#13;
additional complexities engendered by the location o f country focal points inseven&#13;
countries will require extra effort to manage the virtual team.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
I. ProjectBackground&#13;
West Afr-ica i s facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastern Chad. The locust infestationwas first predicted by FA0 inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestationbegan in early 2004 inNorthwest Africa and has now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.&#13;
&#13;
Infestation inBurkina were detected inAugust 2004 inthe provinces o f Oudalan, Soum,&#13;
Seno, Yagha, Sanmatenga, andNamentenga inthe northern region o f the country. About&#13;
16,300 ha have been treated out o f the 109,000 ha that are infested. This compares to&#13;
one-fifth o f the national territory, and includes about a 100 villages that have been&#13;
seriously affected.&#13;
&#13;
The cumulative effect of drought and the locust infestation has caused a significant loss&#13;
o f ago-pastoral production. The consequences include a deficit in food security,&#13;
increased cereal prices, unusual migration o f people, an early nomadic migration, and&#13;
loss o f seeds for next year's agriculture production. Preliminary survey results carried out&#13;
by the Directorate General o f Prediction and Agriculture Statistics indicate that one-third&#13;
o f the deficit in agriculture production (estimated at 60 percent) inthe Sahelian zone of&#13;
Burkina is due to the locust infestation. In addition, there has been a significant&#13;
degradation of pastures in this zone, which is the most important livestock production&#13;
area inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Government Response, Strategy and Program&#13;
Government Strategy       - Since the neighboring countries announced the presence o f&#13;
locusts in their countries, the Government initiated an emergency program to prevent the&#13;
infestation o f Burkina Faso. That program included: (i)       strengthening crop protection&#13;
agencies by improving communication networks, rehabilitation o f vehicles, acquisition o f&#13;
new prospecting and treatment vehicles, and 2,000 personnelprotection kits; (ii)     increase&#13;
o f 2,800 liters stocks o f pesticides with 31,000 liters; (iii) training and organization o f&#13;
producers into treatment brigades; (iv) raising the awareness o f the local population so&#13;
that they could signal infestations; and (v) the setting up a monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
Interms oforganization, the Government has set up the following entities at the national&#13;
level: (i)a National Locust Control Committee that includes the primary partners and&#13;
financiers o f the locust control effort. The committee meets weekly and i s responsible for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mobilizing the resources (human and financial) required for locust control, and (ii)a&#13;
Technical Committee that includes members o f the ministries in charge o f agriculture,&#13;
environment, livestock, research, and some consultants and experts. The Technical&#13;
Committee i s incharge o f monitoring the evolution o f the locust infestation, and informs&#13;
the National Locust Control Committee. Ithas undertaken four field supervision missions&#13;
per month, andprepared reports for the national committee andthe cabinet.&#13;
&#13;
At the provincial level, a Provincial Coordination Committee directed by the High&#13;
Commissioner includes relevant structure and all Directorates in charge o f agriculture,&#13;
animal resources, environment, health, representatives o f the NGOs, and producers. This&#13;
committee is incharge o f supervisingsurveillance and ground level locust control. At the&#13;
departmental level, Crop Protection Units include Prefects and departmental officers o f&#13;
the ministries and o f producers. These units are in charge o f identifying and marking&#13;
infested areas, mobilizing producers to help with the treatments, and informing the&#13;
provincial committee on the evolution o f the infestations. Finally, at the village level,&#13;
producers are organized into Brigades o f 50-100 people who collectively undertake&#13;
treatments.&#13;
&#13;
At the regional and sub-regional level, FA0 and CILSS have provided regular&#13;
information on the locust invasion, but there were no operational coordination actions.&#13;
Bilateral collaborationhas been initiatedwith Mali for treatment inthe border zones.&#13;
&#13;
The emergency program has been implementedwith 28 prospecting andtreatment teams,&#13;
o f which three are deployed inMali. Each team consists o f 10 people, including a team-&#13;
leader, two prospectors, two drivers, and five handymen. The Government has mobilized&#13;
5 four-wheel drive vehicles and one helicopter for the prospecting and treatment&#13;
operations. In addition, it has procured one US$ 14 million airplane. A total o f 8,300&#13;
producers have beentrained and organized into about 100 treatment brigades, but despite&#13;
this effort many areas have been infested. The main reasons for this are: (i) used old&#13;
vehicles have prevented the treatment o f large surfaces, (ii) insufficient number o f&#13;
                                                                an&#13;
pulverizers, (iii)the lack o f means to provide training, (iv) limited communication&#13;
equipment, (v) lack o f spare parts, (vi) weak capacity for airborne interventions, (vii)&#13;
insufficient resources for operational cost, and (viii) insufficient coordination at the&#13;
regional level.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe short-term, the government will provide food for affected populations through a&#13;
delivery mechanism that includes local NGOs. In addition, the government seeks to&#13;
increase agricultural productivity and support income-generating activities that would&#13;
benefit the most affected populations.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe long-term, the government envisages rehabilitating the monitoring network by&#13;
creation o f a locust control base inDori. This new base will cover northem Burkina areas&#13;
andborder areas toward Niger andMali.&#13;
&#13;
Technical partners and donors have supported government efforts in locust control. A&#13;
total o fUS$1.7million has beenreceived from 13 national and internationaldonors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.     Bank Strategy&#13;
Bankassistance will support the Government's overallprogram. Itwillbeprovidedunder&#13;
the Bank's Emergency Procedures (OP/BP 8.50). It will provide support to the&#13;
Government's emergency locust controVeradication operations, complementing the&#13;
assistanceprovided by other donors, but its main focus will be on: (i) rehabilitation o f&#13;
                                                                         the&#13;
destroyed assets and productive capacities o f affected populations and the provision o f&#13;
alternative sources o f employment and revenue through cash-for-work, publicly-funded&#13;
micro-projects,   and infrastructure programs; and (ii)strengthening capacity for&#13;
surveillance, early warning systems, and response mechanisms at national and regional&#13;
levels to reduce the risk and potential social, economic, and environmental impact o f&#13;
future infestations.&#13;
&#13;
IV.      Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives   -The overall objective o f the project is to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact from damage due to the current locust infestation, and to&#13;
improve the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate their&#13;
impact on the national economy and population. The project i s fully in line with&#13;
NEPAD's Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP), which emphasizes&#13;
better disaster preventiodmitigation andrisk management as one on the main instruments&#13;
for growth and poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i) an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized and IDA'Sresources including those o f the PPF); and (ii)    a medium-term&#13;
program aimed a strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
warning, response, mitigation, risk management, and pesticide use and management. The&#13;
progradproject includes four components:&#13;
&#13;
         Emergency Locust Management (controVeradication andpesticide management);&#13;
         EmergencyAssistance to affected populations;&#13;
         Strengthening o f early warning andresponse capacities;     .&#13;
         Project management.&#13;
&#13;
The project, like government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at risk in&#13;
six o fBurkina Faso's provinces. It has been designed on an emergency basis, on the basis&#13;
o f available, sometime incomplete information. It i s therefore likely that it will need to be&#13;
adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will require an&#13;
efficient monitoring and evaluation system from the start o f the program.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
1. Component A - Emergency Locust Management - This component will support&#13;
    government activities increasing the national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Tracking locust infestations, including inneighboringcountries;&#13;
&#13;
        Increasing quick response capacity for effective control operations if an&#13;
        infestation does happen, as appears likely, in the coming months;&#13;
        awareness/information campaigns; training o f farming communities; transport&#13;
        and other equipment for locust detection and control brigades; emergency&#13;
        stocks o f pesticides; protection gear; telecommunication equipment; and related&#13;
        operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
        Carryingout immediate actual field controVeradication operations inearly 2005&#13;
        andpossibly in2006;&#13;
&#13;
        Improving the management o f pesticides through a detailed inventory o f locust&#13;
        control pesticides (to ensure that no bannedchemicals are imported or used); the&#13;
        safe transport, packaging, storage, and destruction o f locust control pesticides in&#13;
        accordance with international standards (International Code o f Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B - Emergency Assistance to Affected Populations - This component will&#13;
  provide assistance to affected populations to restore their productive capacity and&#13;
  provide temporary employmenthncome earningopportunities:&#13;
&#13;
   (i) Restoration of productive capacity. This will be done through several&#13;
           approaches, based on careful targeting,          depending on the specific&#13;
           characteristics o f the concerned areas and populations through in kind&#13;
           assistance -distribution o f "starter packs" o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools,&#13;
           animal feed, etc.) - where necessary; distribution of a cash allowance&#13;
           corresponding to the estimated cost o f the inputs necessary for resuming&#13;
           production (allowing beneficiaries to decide what to purchase and where);&#13;
           and, when appropriate, the partial cancellatiodrescheduling o floans); and&#13;
&#13;
   (ii)    Provision o f alternative employment opportunities. This will provide affected&#13;
           populations with temporary income opportunities while normal income&#13;
           streams are restored through locally planned and managed cash-for-work&#13;
           programs targeted at collective infrastructure (feeder            roads,    dams/&#13;
           irrigatioddrainage, bottomland development).&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C - Strengthening Early Warning and Response Capacities - This&#13;
   component will support the strengthening o f national and regional capacities for&#13;
   locust infestation surveillance, control and mitigation; and the preparation o f national&#13;
   and regional strategies to manage natural disastershisks inrural areas. Specifically, it&#13;
   will support:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)      Sensitization and training of farming communities/groups to locust and&#13;
               other pest detection and control;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       (ii) Strengtheningthenationalpestmanagementservices (additionalhuman&#13;
                resources, constructionhehabilitation o f facilities, specialized equipment)&#13;
                to ensure minimum efficiency and viability during remission periods and&#13;
                an adequate quick response capability incase o f emergency;&#13;
&#13;
       (iii) Implementationofastrengthenedresearchprogramonlocustbiological&#13;
                control and IPM, carried out through the national agricultural research&#13;
                system (IER) but also throughparticipation (researchers, financial) injoint&#13;
                regionalresearch programs carried out under CORAF coordination;&#13;
&#13;
       (iv)     Participation in collective activities at the regional level such as an&#13;
                operational/institutional audit o f the current regional system for locust and&#13;
                other pest management systems aimed at improving their efficiency and&#13;
                sustainability; and the design o f a regional mechanism for natural disaster&#13;
                risk management in rural areas (based on close integration between local,&#13;
                national, and regional instruments).&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D - Project Management - This component will support the cost o f&#13;
   project management         unit (office    rehabilitation and equipment,         short-term&#13;
   consultancies, incremental operating costs), including financial and technical audits,&#13;
   and participation in coordination meetings at the regional level. It will in particular&#13;
   finance the design, establishment, and operations o f a comprehensive M&amp;E program&#13;
   (including economic, social and environmental impacts as well as cross boundaries&#13;
   issues) based on and fully integratedwith existing institutional and M&amp;E systems.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs and Impact - The overall achievement o f the project will be monitored&#13;
through the following (output/impact) performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost includes short-term activities that have been funded bythe PPF granted by&#13;
IDA on September 22,2004 which has also beenusedfor the detailedpreparationo fthe&#13;
Government's medium-term program presented below. It will be refinanced under the&#13;
Bank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
The project i s part o f government's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i)        the magnitude o f&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; and (ii)    the already mobilized&#13;
and committed financial support. It is therefore likely that both its detailed design and&#13;
fundingwill need to be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on the ground&#13;
andadditional financial resources that maybecome available. The estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments inthe program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content, and reallocations o f finds between components, will be done every yeadas&#13;
necessary in close cooperation with all funding partners, on the basis of actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the M&amp;E system that will be established at&#13;
the start o f the program). Unnecessary/unused funds from the IDA credit will be&#13;
cancelled at the end o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Government has secured US$1.7 million from bilateral and multilateral donors.&#13;
These funds have allowed Burkina Faso to upgrade equipment, andpurchase vehicles and&#13;
pesticides for immediate locust control activities.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation    - The Ministry in charge o f Agriculture will be responsible for&#13;
project implementation. The project i s multi-sectoral and will be implemented under the&#13;
guidance of a steering committee, including representatives from government, donors and&#13;
the civil society. A Project Coordinator will be appointed within the Department o f Crop&#13;
Production to manage and coordinate Project implementation activities. The Project&#13;
Coordinator will be responsible for (i)    preparing detailed implementation plans and&#13;
budgets, (ii)discussing these plans and budgets with participating donors; (iii)&#13;
supervisingimplementation activities; (iv) coordinatingwith regional institutions; and(v)&#13;
reporting on the use o f resources and results. The PC will be responsible for coordinating&#13;
the support o f all external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence in the use o f all&#13;
available resources, and for timely and accurate reporting. The responsibilities and&#13;
accountability o f the Project Coordinator will be detailed in a performance contract&#13;
agreed upon with the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee. The financial&#13;
management and procurement activities will be managed by a community-based rural&#13;
development project (PNGTII). that i s already established and operating according to&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
It will be implemented through existing institutions and used to strengthen the national&#13;
institutional framework. Local communities/populations will be closely associated with&#13;
the planning, implementation, and monitoring o f its activities. For implementation o f its&#13;
activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners (Department of&#13;
Agricultural Services, National Agricultural Research Institute, National Environment&#13;
Agency, Department of Finances, Department o f Health Services, Non-Governmental&#13;
Organizations, and the Department of Animals Resources), as well as with institutions in&#13;
other countries and relevant regional institutions for collective action relating to regional&#13;
public goods. This is in particular the case for the proposed research program which&#13;
focuses on adaptive research, mainly researchrelatedthe use o fbio-pesticides.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistance to affected populations and monitoring o f efficient delivery. The detailed&#13;
Project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at the&#13;
start o fproject.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project is part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates about the future evolution o f the infestation and its impact on agricultural&#13;
communities. Relative emphasis among components and related funding requirements&#13;
will need to beregularly adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on the ground&#13;
andadditional financial resources that maybecome available..&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. Government o f Burkina Faso&#13;
will finance 100 percent o f (i) and duties (estimated at a rate o f 20 percent). The&#13;
                                 taxes&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be: about 61 percent o f the IDA Credit i s expected&#13;
to be disbursed during IDA fiscal year 2005; 14 percent during fiscal year 2006, 13&#13;
percent duringfiscal year 2007, and 12percent during fiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one special account. This special account,&#13;
which should be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction-based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated special account. The advance to the special account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing finds from the Credit i s the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods, and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work, and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMU will be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the special account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed CFAF400,000,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible expenditures&#13;
finawed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f&#13;
CFAF200,000,000 into the Special Account, representing approximately 50 percent o f&#13;
the authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount o f all&#13;
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed&#13;
the equivalent o f SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f finds from IDA to the special&#13;
account will be made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in&#13;
SOEs (Statement o f Expenditures) and/or on filldocumentation for payments above SOE&#13;
thresholds. The special account will be used for all payments below 20 percent o f the&#13;
authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submitted on&#13;
a monthly basis. Ifineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special&#13;
account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts withdrawn. Ifthe special&#13;
account remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to&#13;
refindthe amounts advanced to the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o fthe funds ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                            39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e) training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by&#13;
PMU andwill be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
All applications for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticides, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
&#13;
Whenproject implementationbegins, the quarterlyFinancial MonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate production o f the Financial Monitoring&#13;
Report (FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a&#13;
borrower requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken&#13;
by the Task Team Lleader (TTL), to determine ifthe project is eligible. The adoption o f&#13;
report-based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time&#13;
consuming voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - N o withdrawals shall be made in respect of: (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date o f this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnished to the Association a Pest Management&#13;
Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii)    for the purchase o f&#13;
pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List ; and (c) payments made under&#13;
category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
forth or referred to inthe Project ImplementationPlan andthe provisions o fparagraph 13 o f&#13;
Schedule 4 o fthe DevelopmentCredit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Project account - This account will be opened ina commercialbank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly inthis account inaccordance with project&#13;
needs. To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works, and&#13;
services, uponproject effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
into the project account o f CFAF30,000,000 covering an estimated six months o f eligible&#13;
expenditures co-financed by the government.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Fiduciary responsibility - This responsibility will be taken by the PlUo f the PNGT 2.&#13;
PNGT2 hasbeen ineffect since 2002, andthe procurement unit o fits PlUis composed&#13;
o f a procurement specialist and two assistants with qualifications to handle procurement.&#13;
However, the increased workload will not allow the procurement team to perform its&#13;
activities satisfactorily. Thus, a procurement specialist should be hiredbefore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  effectiveness of the project, or a consultant will be recruited to strengthen the capacity o f&#13;
  the procurement unit.&#13;
&#13;
  While waiting for the reinforcement o fthe procurement team, the actual team will work&#13;
  closely with the technical coordination o f the Locust project inorder to prepare the&#13;
 procurement plan o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
  The procedures and financial management manual used inPNGT2 will be adapted as&#13;
 needed to take into account the reality o f the newproject.&#13;
&#13;
 An external audit o fthe procurement should also beput inplace, andthe filing system&#13;
  shouldbe improved inorder to facilitate the access to information by auditors and&#13;
  supervisions.&#13;
&#13;
 Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement - The procurement unit&#13;
 o fPNGT 2 is composed by a procurement specialist and two assistants with qualification&#13;
 to handleprocurement. However, giventhe workload increase, a new procurement&#13;
  specialist or a consultant should be recruitedbefore effectiveness o f the project.&#13;

              CHAD EMERGENCY LOCUST PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I. ProjectBackground&#13;
West Africa is facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastern Chad. The locust infestation was first predictedby FA0 inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestation began inearly 2004 inNorthwest Africa and has now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad).&#13;
&#13;
Chad i s one o f the four countries hosting DL breeding areas in West Africa. The first&#13;
signs o f infestation in Chad were detected in July 2004 in the Sahelian regions. Two&#13;
thirds o f the country were affected by the DL infestation. The Government, with the&#13;
support o f FA0 and donors represented inthe Country, started control operation in July&#13;
2004. About 16,500 ha were treated at the end o f October 2004. The main issues faced by&#13;
Government included lack o f resources, vehicles, sprayers, aerial control teams, and&#13;
ground control teams.&#13;
&#13;
During Se tember hopper groups and bands o f all instars, at densities up to 130&#13;
hoppershnf were mixed with scattered adults in the central region o f Batha, in the&#13;
northeastern regions o f Arada, and inthe eastern region o f Ouadai.&#13;
&#13;
However, swarms are reproducing and migrating across borders following a so-called&#13;
"circular migration" between North Africa and the Sahelian zone, which may cause&#13;
multiplesuccessive seasonal attacks over two to three years as has happened inprevious&#13;
infestations. Chad i s mostly likely to be affected by Desert Locust (DL) swarms that will&#13;
start moving back southward inthe winter and early spring o f 2005, and at least 800,000&#13;
hamay have to be treated again in2005 and possibly halfthat area in2006.&#13;
&#13;
It is too early to have precise estimates o f crop andpasture losses suffered so far in2004.&#13;
However, it i s already estimated that up to 100,000 tons o f cereals may have been lost&#13;
already due to the locust invasion (out o f a total shortfall o fabout 300,000 tons which i s also&#13;
linked to the significant rain deficit experienced in producing areas). There i s mounting&#13;
evidence o f large scale distress sales o f livestock because o f the lack o f pasture and fodder.&#13;
Inaddition, the lackofadequatefodder for livestockhasinducedthe premature migrationof&#13;
herds to the south, sometime through unusual routes, which will increase the occurrence of&#13;
conflicts with local farmers. Although the impact o fthe invasionon national food security i s&#13;
still being estimated, there is no doubt that its impact at the household level has been&#13;
devastating. Because of the specific characteristics o f locust damage (juxtaposition o f areas&#13;
where losses are nearly complete with areas which are totally spared). Families intheworst&#13;
affected areas have lost up to 100% o ftheir production and are thus destitute. It i s estimated&#13;
that upto 200.000 households (1,500,000 persons) will need food aid as well as assistanceto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
restore their productive assets and access to transitory employment and income&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as demonstrated by previous infestations (1988 and 1994), the negative impact of&#13;
locust infestations i s not only short-term. They reverberates for a number o f years on the&#13;
national economy because o f the forced diversion o f scarce development resources to fight&#13;
the plague andthe wide-spread destruction o fproductive assets. There i s thus an immediate&#13;
need to (i)  take all necessary measures to suppress and eradicate locust swarms as they&#13;
return inearly 2005 to prevent further damage andrural families beingpushed into absolute&#13;
poverty; and(ii)  assist affected populations to restore their productive capacity. There is also&#13;
a need to build national and regional capacities for locust surveillance, early warning,&#13;
control, and mitigation, as well more generally as for developing more effective strategies&#13;
andmechanisms to managerisks inruralareas.&#13;
&#13;
11.     GovernmentResponse, Strategy andProgram&#13;
Government Strategy. In the spring o f 2004, on the basis o f the lessons learned and&#13;
following consultations with FAO, the government o f Chad has taken early action to&#13;
efficiently mobilize domestic and external resources for controlling and suppressing the&#13;
infestation. It (i)established an Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee, chaired by&#13;
the Minister o f Agriculture, to coordinate government action andmobilize resources; (ii)&#13;
designed an action plan for Locust control; (iii)conducted assessment surveys to&#13;
determine presence o f DL; (iv) carried out sensitization campaigns for farmers and other&#13;
stakeholders (press conferences,); (v) established twelve ground detectiodcontrol teams;&#13;
(vi) mobilized farmer ground control brigades; and (vii) organized DLcontrol training to&#13;
strengthen staff involved in control activities. Finally, the government has organized&#13;
weekly meetings with domestic and external partners - FAO, UNDP, EU, WFP,&#13;
ambassadors, international development institutions, NGOs, the public and private&#13;
sectors -to mobilize and efficiently coordinate the needed assistance. The government&#13;
designed an action plan for locust control, the restoration o f agricultural assets and&#13;
productivity in areas affected by locust invasion. This program&lt;waspresented at the&#13;
Locust Control Meeting, held inJuly 2004 at Dakar, Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
111.     BankStrategy&#13;
Bank assistance will support the Government's overall program. It will be provided under&#13;
the Bank's Emergency Procedures (OPBP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust control/eradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
by other donors but its main focus will be on (i) rehabilitation o f destroyed assets and&#13;
                                                     the&#13;
productive capacities o f affected populations and the provision o f alternative sources o f&#13;
employment and revenue through cash-for-work publicly h d e d micro-projects and&#13;
infi-astructure programs; and (ii)   strengthening capacity for surveillance, early warning&#13;
systems, and response mechanisms at the national and regional levels to reduce the risk&#13;
andpotential social, economic, andenvironmental impact o ffuture infestations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.     Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives. The overall objective o f the project is to minimize economic and&#13;
social damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve the national capacity&#13;
to predict and control future infestations and mitigate their impact on the national&#13;
economy and populations. The project is fully in line with the Chad poverty reduction&#13;
strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also fully in line with NEPAD's&#13;
Comprehensive Afkican Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes better disaster&#13;
preventiodmitigation and risk management as one on the main instruments for growth&#13;
andpoverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i) an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized and IDA'Sresources including those o f the PPF); and (ii)     a medium-&#13;
term program aimed at strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance,&#13;
early warning, response, mitigation, risk management, and pesticide use and&#13;
management. The progradproject includes four components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Locust control and eradication, andpesticide management;&#13;
&#13;
    0   Assistance to affectedpopulations;&#13;
        Strengthening of capacities o f forecasting, early warning, response andmitigation&#13;
        (including regional cooperation);&#13;
        Programmanagement.&#13;

The project, like the government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at&#13;
risks in the Lac, Kanem, Batha, Ouaddai, Wadi Fira, and Bet regions that represent two-&#13;
third o f the country. It has been designed on an emergency basis, on the basis o f&#13;
available, sometime incomplete information. It i s therefore likely that it will need to be&#13;
adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will require the&#13;
establishment from the start o f the program o f an efficient M&amp;E system.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
1. Component A - Emergency Locust Control - This component will support&#13;
    government activities increasing the national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)    Tracking locust infestation focusing on breeding areas, including in&#13;
               neighboring countries;&#13;
&#13;
        (ii)   Increasing quick response capacity for effective control operations if an&#13;
               infestation does happen,        as is likely in the        coming months:&#13;
               awarenesshnformation campaigns, training o f farming communities,&#13;
               transport and other equipment for locust detection and control brigades,&#13;
               emergency stocks o f pesticides, protection gear; telecommunication&#13;
               equipment, andrelated operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (iii)    Carrying out immediate actual field controVeradication operations should&#13;
               an outbreak materialize inearly 2005 ;&#13;
&#13;
       (iv)    Improving the management o f pesticides through a detailed inventory o f&#13;
               Locust control pesticides (to ensure that no banned chemicals re imported&#13;
               or used); the safe transport, packaging, storage and destruction o f Locust&#13;
               control   pesticides,     in accordance     with international   standards&#13;
               (International Code of Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B - Restoration o f Populations Productive Capacities - This component&#13;
  will provide assistanceto potentially affected populations through:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)     The distribution o f "starter packs" o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools,&#13;
               animal feed, etc.) to maintainhestore the productive capacities o f the&#13;
               affected farmers and herders; and&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)    The undertaking o f cash-for-work programs or collective productive&#13;
               micro-projects (dams, irrigatioddrainage, bottomland development), to&#13;
               provide alternative sources o f employment and revenues until the normal&#13;
               income streams are restored.&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C - Strengthening National Capacities - This component will support the&#13;
   strengthening o f national capacities, and o f the regional capacities for undertaking&#13;
   collective action for surveillance/early warning, and control and mitigation o f locust&#13;
   (and other pests) infestations. Specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
               The sensitization and training o f farming communities/groups to&#13;
               locust/pest detection and control;&#13;
&#13;
               The complementary equipment o f the national pest management services&#13;
               (constructionhehabilitation o f facilities, specialized equipment) and the&#13;
               training, o f its staff;&#13;
&#13;
               The implementation o f a strengthened research program on Locust&#13;
               biological control and IPM, inparticular through participation into a joint&#13;
               regional research program under C O W ;&#13;
&#13;
               Short-term technical assistance and studies to develop a comprehensive&#13;
               national natural risk management/vulnerabilityreduction strategy to be&#13;
               integrated into The Gambia's overall PRSP and rural development&#13;
               strategy;     and     strengthen  the    close    integration o f  national&#13;
               programs/activities into the regional framework for locust and other pest&#13;
               management systems.&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D - Project Management and Coordination - This component will support&#13;
   the cost o f project management unit (office rehabilitation and equipment, short-term&#13;
   consultancies, incremental operating costs), including financial and technical audits,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              54&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    and participation in coordination meetings at the regional level. It will in particular&#13;
    finance the design, establishment, and operations o f a comprehensive M&amp;E system&#13;
    (including economic, social and environmental impacts as well as cross-boundaries&#13;
    issues) based on and fully integrated with existing institutional and M&amp;E systems.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs and Impact - The overall achievement o f the project will be monitored&#13;
through the following (outputhmpact) performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost includes the cost o f short-term activities which have been funded through&#13;
the PPF granted by IDA on September 22, 2004. The PPF has also been used for the&#13;
detailed preparation o f Government's medium-term program presentedbelow. It will be&#13;
refinanced underBank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
The project i s part o f the government's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i)     the magnitude o f&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; (ii)  the already mobilized and&#13;
committed financial support. It i s therefore likely that both its detailed design and its&#13;
funding will needto be adjusted to fit the actual evolution of the situation on the ground,&#13;
and additional financial resources that may become available. Its estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments inthe program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content and reallocations o f funds between components will be done every yeadas&#13;
necessary in close cooperation with all funding partners, on the basis o f actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the M&amp;E system that will be established from&#13;
the start o f the program). Unnecessary/unused funds from the IDA credit will be&#13;
cancelled at the end o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Other Funding Already Mobilized - The Government has secured many contributions&#13;
from bilateral and multilateral donors. These funds have allowed Chad to upgrade&#13;
equipment, purchase vehicles, and pesticides for immediate locust control activities. The&#13;
details o f donations are provided inthe table below:&#13;

&#13;
     Project Implementation - The Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for project&#13;
     implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it will be implemented&#13;
     under the guidance of the Inter-MinisterialLocust Control Committee which be enlarged&#13;
     to include representatives from farmers Organization and NGOs. A Project Coordinator&#13;
     will be appointed within the Secretariat of Agriculture to manage and coordinate the&#13;
      activities of the Project. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for (i)    preparing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
detailed implementation plans and budgets, (ii)     discussing these plans and budgets with&#13;
the steering committee including participating donors; (iii)     supervising implementation&#13;
activities; (iv) coordinating with regional institutions; and (v) and reporting on the use o f&#13;
resources and results achieved. The financial management and procurement activities&#13;
will be implemented through the Agricultural Services and Producers Organization&#13;
Project (ASPOP) which i s already established and operating according to procedures&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The PC will be responsible for coordinating the support o f all&#13;
external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence inthe use o f all available resources,&#13;
and for timely and accurate reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The Project will be implemented through existing institutions and used for strengthening&#13;
the national institutional framework. Local communities/populations will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation of its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(Ministry o f Livestock, National Agricultural Research Institute,              Ministry o f&#13;
Environment, Ministry o f Planning, Ministry o f Health Services, Non Governmental&#13;
Organizations, Farmers and Herders Organizations) as well as with institutions in other&#13;
countries and relevant regional institutions for collective actions concerning regional&#13;
public goods. This i s inparticular the case for the proposedresearch program which will&#13;
be implemented with the national research institute and within a regional CORAF&#13;
network and insynergy with a COR4.F member international institute.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistance to affectedpopulations and to the monitoring o f efficient delivery.The detailed&#13;
Project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at&#13;
project start up.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project is part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates regarding the fbture evolution o f the infestation and its impact on&#13;
agricultural communities. Relative emphasis among components and related funding&#13;
requirements will need to be regularly adjusted to fit with the actual evolution o f the&#13;
situation on the ground, and additional financial resources that may become available.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. The disbursement schedule i s&#13;
expected to be as follows: about 59 percent o f the IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed&#13;
duringIDA fiscal year 2005; 23 percent during fiscal year 2006, 13 percent duringfiscal&#13;
year 2007 and 5 percent during fiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one Special Account. This Special Account,&#13;
which should be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated Special Account. The advance to the Special Account will be usedto&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing funds from the Credit i s the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the P M U will be requiredto submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the Special Account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed CFAF450,000,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f&#13;
CFAF225,000,000 into the Special Account, representing approximately fifty percent o f&#13;
the authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount o f all&#13;
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed&#13;
the equivalent o f SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the Special&#13;
Account will be made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected&#13;
in SOEs (Statement of Expenditures) andor on full documentation for payments above&#13;
SOE thresholds. The special account will be used for all payments below twenty percent&#13;
o f the authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be&#13;
submitted on a monthly basis. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made&#13;
from the Special Account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts&#13;
withdrawn. Ifthe Special Account remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may&#13;
request the Borrower to refund the amounts advanced to the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected in the Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o fthe funds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value of less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e) training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by&#13;
PMU, and will be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
All applications for the withdrawal of proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticides, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly financial MonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
task team leader (TTL), to determine if the project i s eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher byvoucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - No withdrawals shall be made in respect o f (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnished to the Association a Pest Management&#13;
Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii)   for the purchase o f&#13;
pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List ; and (c) payments made under&#13;
category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
forth or referred to inthe Project ImplementationPlanandthe provisions o fparagraph 13 of&#13;
Schedule 4 o fthe Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Project account - This account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly in this account in accordance with project&#13;
needs.     To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, upon project effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
into the project account o f CFAF100,000,000 covering an estimated six months of&#13;
eligibleexpenditures cofinancedbythe govemment.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
The Procurement inAfrican Emergency Locust Project for Chad will be managedby the&#13;
"Projet de Services Agricoles &amp; Organisation de Producteurs" (PSAOP), including for&#13;
fiduciary aspects.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements&#13;
The PSAOP already operational andhas aprocurement specialist. Because o fadditional&#13;
activities, atemporary consultant will berecruitedas necessaryto carry out specific tasks&#13;
andhelpthe procurement specialist to respectimplementationschedule. The recruitment of&#13;
this consultant should be acceptable by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
The PSAOP will closely work with all the partners involved inthe project mplementation&#13;
especially the Direction o fProtection des VCgCtaux et de Conditionnement.&#13;
&#13;
The PSAOP will be responsible for reporting on Project progress, financial management,&#13;
procurement and disbursement. The Project Implementation Unit will use hismanual o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 procedures to manage the new project. This manual o fprocedures will be adjusted if&#13;
 necessary to reflect the requirements o f the new project.&#13;
&#13;
 Finally, all procurement package will be prepared bythe procurement specialist of&#13;
 PSAOP and inaccordance with the procurement planaccepted by the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 Summary o f assessment o fthe agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
     a   The PSAOP will act as the PMUo fthis project andhas procurement capacity.&#13;
         Procurement capacity o f PSAOP couldbe reinforcedifnecessary by specific&#13;
         trainings. No major procurement risks.&#13;
     a   The Government has therefore includedprovision to recruit a temporary qualified&#13;
         consultant for helpingthe procurement specialist to accelerate the implantation o f&#13;
         activities. The decision to select an individualtemporary consultant will depend&#13;
         on the scope, nature and number o f contracts to be awarded duringthe&#13;
         implementationo f the program. This decision should bemade by appraisal of the&#13;
         project. The selection process should start before negotiations inorder to have the&#13;
         contract awarded before effectiveness.&#13;

The first signs o f infestation inMali were detected inlate 2003 inthe Northern region o f&#13;
the country. About 40,000 ha were immediately treated and the outbreak was thought to&#13;
be under control. However, favorable conditions in the Southern Atlas region permitted&#13;
large new swarms to form and reinvade Mali and the other front-line states (Mauritania,&#13;
Niger, Chad) inthe spring o f 2004. More than 70 swarms o f up to 2.0 million insects /ha&#13;
were detected along the front-line zone from Mali to Mauritania. It i s estimated that&#13;
between May and October 2004, locusts covered more than 750,000 ha where they have&#13;
caused wide-spread crop andpasture losses.&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Mali resumed control operations in March 2004. About 350,000 ha&#13;
have been treated and the upsurge has been brought under control again, at least&#13;
temporarily. Numerous swarms have moved north into northwest Mauritania, Western&#13;
Sahara, and the foothills o f the Atlas mountains in Algeria where intensive aerial and&#13;
ground control operations were immediately initiated.&#13;
&#13;
However, swarms are reproducing and migrating across borders following a so-called&#13;
"circular migration" between North Africa and the Sahelian zone, which may cause&#13;
multiplesuccessive seasonal attacks over two to three years as has happened inprevious&#13;
infestations. Mali i s mostly likely to be affected by Desert Locust (DL) swarms that will&#13;
start moving southward again in the winter and early spring o f 2005 and that at least&#13;
650,000 ha may have to be treated again in2005 andpossibly halfthat area in2006.&#13;
&#13;
It is too early to have precise estimates o f crop and pasture losses suffered so far in2004.&#13;
However, it i s already estimated that up to 150,000 tons o f cereals may have been lost&#13;
already due to the locust invasion (out o f a total shortfall o f about 400,000 tons which is&#13;
linked to a significant rain deficit inproducing areas). There i s mounting evidence o f large-&#13;
scale distress sales o f livestock because o f the lack o f pasture and fodder. In addition, the&#13;
lack o f adequate fodder for livestock has induced the premature migration o f herds to the&#13;
south, sometime through unusual routes, which will increase the occurrence o f conflicts&#13;
with local farmers. Although the impact of the invasion on national food security is still&#13;
beingestimated, there isno doubt that its impact at the household levelhasbeendevastating.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                72&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Because o f the specific characteristics o f locust damage (juxtaposition o f areas where losses&#13;
are near complete with areas which are totally spared). Families in the worst affected areas&#13;
have lost up to 100 percent o ftheir production. They are thus destitute andneed emergency&#13;
assistance. It i s estimated that up to 100,000 farm families (1,000,000 persons) will need&#13;
food aid as well as assistanceto restore their productive assets andhave access to transitory&#13;
employment and income opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as demonstrated by previous infestations (1988 and 1994), the negative impact o f&#13;
locust infestationis not only short-term. Itreverberates for a number o f years on the national&#13;
economy because o f the forced diversion o f scarce development resources to fight the&#13;
plague andthe wide-spread destruction o fproductive assets. There i s thus a immediate need&#13;
to (i) all necessarymeasures to suppress and eradicate locust swarms as they return in&#13;
      take&#13;
early 2005 to prevent additional damage and rural families being pushed fiuther into&#13;
absolute poverty; and (ii)   assist affected populations to restore their productive capacity.&#13;
There is also a need for building national and regional capacities for locust surveillance,&#13;
early warning, control and mitigation, as well more generally to for develop more effective&#13;
strategies andmechanisms to manage risks inrural areas.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Government Response, Strategy, and Program&#13;
Government Strategy - In the spring o f 2004, on the basis o f the lessons learned and&#13;
following consultations with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the&#13;
government o f Mali has taken early action for efficiently mobilizing domestic and&#13;
external resources for controlling and suppressing the infestation. It (i)established an&#13;
Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee, chaired by the Minister o f Agriculture, to&#13;
coordinate government action and mobilize resources; (ii)       conducted assessment surveys&#13;
to determine presence o f DL; (iii)    carried out sensitizations campaigns for fanners and&#13;
other stakeholders (press conferences, informatiodinstruction bulletins to the farming&#13;
communities and the general public for the sighting and reporting o f DL); (iv) established&#13;
35 ground detectiodcontrol teams and mobilized 12 planes and 1 helicopter for aerial&#13;
spraying' (v) mobilized more than 15,000 farmers and volunteers for ground brigades;&#13;
(vi) mobilized the national army for logistics and ground operations; and (vii) acquired&#13;
(480,000 liters) and distributed (270,000 liters) pesticides, spraying equipment (18 truck-&#13;
mounted and 2,500 man-carried), communication equipment and protective gears for the&#13;
locust control teams. An operational command post has been created in August 2004,&#13;
headed by the Police Chief Officer, to coordinate field operations. Finally, the&#13;
government has organized weekly meetings with domestic and external partners -- FAO,&#13;
UNDP, EU, Ambassadors, international development institutions, NGOs, the public and&#13;
private sectors - to mobilize and efficiently coordinate the needed assistance. The&#13;
government also designed a detailed operational program for Locust control and the&#13;
restoration o f agricultural assets and productivity in areas affected by locust invasion.&#13;
This program was presented at the Locust control Meeting, held in July 2004 Dakar,&#13;
Senegal. As a result, control activities have intensified over the summer and it is&#13;
estimated that more than 350,000 hectares o f infested land have so far been treated. The&#13;
infestation has been temporarily brought under control.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                73&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.    Bank Strategy&#13;
Bank assistance will support Government's overallprogram. Itwillbeprovidedunderthe&#13;
Bank's Emergency Procedures (OPBP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust control/eradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
byother donors but its main focus will be on (i) rehabilitation o fdestroyed assets and&#13;
                                                   the&#13;
productive capacities of affected populations [and the provision of alternative sources o f&#13;
employment and revenues through cash-for-work publicly funded micro-projects and&#13;
infrastructure programs]; and (ii) strengthening o f capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
                                      the&#13;
warning systems and response mechanisms at national but also at regional levels, for&#13;
reducing the risk and potential social, economic and environmental impact of future&#13;
infestations.&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Project Description&#13;
&#13;
Overall Objectives - The overall objective o f the project is to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve&#13;
the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate its impact on&#13;
the national economy and populations. The project is fully inline with The Mali poverty&#13;
reduction strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also fully inline with NEPAD's&#13;
Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes better disaster&#13;
preventiodmitigation and risk management as one on the main instruments for growth&#13;
and poverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i)  an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized andIDA'Sresources including those o f the PPF); and (ii)    a medium-tenn&#13;
program aimed a strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
warning, response, mitigation, risk management and pesticide use and management. The&#13;
progradproject includes four components:&#13;
&#13;
        Emergency Locust Management (controVeradication andpesticide management);&#13;
        Emergency Assistance to affected populations;&#13;
         Strengthening of early warning and response capacities;&#13;
        Project management.&#13;
&#13;
The project, like government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at risks&#13;
in seven of Mali 9 regions (in total about 130 communes out of the country 702, see&#13;
annexl). It has beendesigned on an emergency basis, on the basis o f available, sometime&#13;
incomplete information. It i s therefore likely that it will need to be adjusted to fit the&#13;
actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will require the establishment from&#13;
the start o fthe program o f an efficient monitoring andevaluation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have four components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              74&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. Component A       - Emergency Locust Management - This component will support&#13;
  government activities increasingthe national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)     Tracking locust infestation, including inneighboringcountries;&#13;
&#13;
     (ii)    Increasing quick response capacity for effective control operations ifan&#13;
             infestation does happen, as it is likely, inthe coming months:&#13;
             awareness/information campaigns, training o f farming communities,&#13;
             transport andother equipment for locust detection andcontrol brigades,&#13;
             emergency stocks o fpesticides, protection gear; telecommunication&#13;
             equipment, and related operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
     (iii)   Carrying out immediate actual field control/eradication operations inearly&#13;
             2005, and possibly in2006;&#13;
&#13;
     (iv)    Improving the management o fpesticides through: a detailed inventory o f&#13;
             locust control pesticides (to ensure that no bannedchemicals re imported or&#13;
             used); the safe transport, packaging, storage and destructiono flocust&#13;
             control pesticides, inaccordance with international standards (International&#13;
             Code o f Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B - Emergency Assistance to Affected Populations - This component will&#13;
  provide assistance to affected populations for the restoration o f their productive&#13;
  capacity and the provision o ftemporary employment/income earning opportunities:&#13;
&#13;
     (9      Restoration of productive capacity. This will be done through several&#13;
             approaches, based on careful targeting, depending on the specific&#13;
             characteristics o f the concerned areas and populations:       through in kind&#13;
             assistance --distribution o f &lt;&lt; starter packs  ))o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
             tools, animal feed, etc.)-where      necessary; through distribution o f a cash&#13;
             allowance corresponding to the estimated cost o f the inputs necessary for&#13;
             resuming production (allowing beneficiaries to decide what to purchase and&#13;
             where); and, when appropriate, through the partial cancellatiodrescheduling&#13;
             o f loans) ;and&#13;
&#13;
     (ii) Provision of alternative employmentopportunities. Thiswillbedone to&#13;
             provide affected populations with temporary income opportunities while&#13;
             normal income streams are restored through locally planned and managed&#13;
             cash for work programs targeted at collective infrastructure (feeder roads,&#13;
             dams/irrigation/drainage,bottomlanddevelopment).&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C:       Strengthening o f early Warning and Response Capacities - This&#13;
  component will support the strengthening o f national and regional capacities for&#13;
   locust infestation surveillance, control and mitigation; and the preparation o f national&#13;
   and regional strategies for the management o f natural disasterdrisks in rural areas.&#13;
  Specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             75&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              The sensitization and training o f farming communities/groups to locust and&#13;
              other pest detection andcontrol;&#13;
&#13;
              The strengthening o f the national Locust management services (additional&#13;
              human resources, constructionhehabilitation o f facilities,        specialized&#13;
              equipment) to ensure minimum efficiency and viability during remission&#13;
              periods and an adequate quick response capability incase o f emergency;&#13;
&#13;
              The implementation o f a strengthenedresearch program on locust biological&#13;
              control and IPM, carried out through the national agricultural research&#13;
              system (SNRA) but also through participation (researchers, financial) in&#13;
              joint regional researchprograms carried out under C O W coordination;&#13;
&#13;
              The     preparation   o f   a    comprehensive      national    natural   risk&#13;
              managementhlnerability reduction strategy to be integrated into Mali's&#13;
              overall PRSP andrural development strategy; and&#13;
&#13;
              The participation in collective activities at regional level such as an&#13;
              operationalhnstitutional audit o f the current regional system for locust and&#13;
              other pest management systems aimed at improving their efficiency and&#13;
              sustainability; and the design o f a regional mechanism for natural disaster&#13;
              risk management in rural areas (based on close integration between local,&#13;
              national andregional instruments).&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D. Project Management The component will support the cost o fproject&#13;
                                          -&#13;
   management unit (office rehabilitation and equipment, short-term consultancies,&#13;
    incremental operating costs),      including financial and technical audits, and&#13;
   participation in coordination meetings at the regional level.       It will in particular&#13;
    finance the design, establishment and operations o f a comprehensive program&#13;
   monitoring and evaluation system (including economic, social and environmental&#13;
    impacts as well as cross boundaries issues) based on and fully integratedwith existing&#13;
    institutional and M&amp;E systems.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs and Impact - The overall achievement o f the project will be monitored&#13;
through the following (outputhmpact) performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The government will fund the balance o f US$16.5 millions et un programme&#13;
d'attenuation des impacts de l'invasion acridienne et des autres risques en milieu rural,&#13;
notamment la sechersse est en cours de preparation au Commissariat ii la SCcuritC&#13;
Alimentaire. Ce programme sera soumis ii l'ensemble des partenaires techniques et&#13;
financiers avant 2005. The total cost includes the cost o f short-term activities which have&#13;
been funded bythe PPF grantedby IDA on September 22,2004 which has also beenused&#13;
for the detailed preparation o f Government's medium-term program presented below. It&#13;
will be refinancedunder Bank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             76&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The project i s part o f government's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i)      the magnitude o f&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; (ii)   the already mobilized and&#13;
committed financial support. It i s therefore likely that both its detailed design and its&#13;
funding will needto be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground,&#13;
and additional financial resources that may become available. Its estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments inthe program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content, and reallocations o f funds between components, will be done every yeadas&#13;
necessary in close cooperation with all fundingpartners, on the basis o f actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the monitoring and evaluation system that&#13;
will be established from the start o f the program). Un-necessary/unused funds from the&#13;
IDAcredit willbe cancelled at the endo fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Other Funding- Other funding has beenprovided by: Government; FAO/USAIDUS$l.O&#13;
million; AfDB US$1.6 million and EUUS$7.1 million. Total contributions received to&#13;
date from domestic partners to date amount in cash (for donors: US$S.O millions; for&#13;
state for civil society US$3.0 millions; fuel and pesticides at national level amounts not&#13;
evaluated Government contribution i s estimated at US$l.9 million.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation - The Ministry o f Agriculture will be responsible for project&#13;
implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it will be implemented&#13;
under the guidance o f the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee which be enlarged&#13;
to include representatives from... and the civil society. A Project Coordinator will be&#13;
appointed within the National Unity o f Desert Locust Control (UNLCP) to manage and&#13;
coordinate the activities o f the Project. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for (i)&#13;
preparing detailed implementation plans and budgets, (ii)        discussing these plans and&#13;
budgets with participating donors; (iii)supervising implementation activities; (iv)&#13;
coordinating with regional institutions; and (v) and reporting on the use o f resources and&#13;
results achieved. A Coordination Unit set up by the Government will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the support o f all external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence in&#13;
the use o f all available resources, and for timely and accurate reporting.               The&#13;
responsibilities and accountability o f the Project Coordinator will be detailed in a&#13;
performance contract agreed upon with the National Coordination Committee including&#13;
the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee.            The financial management and&#13;
procurement activities will be managed by PASAOP Which i s already established and&#13;
operating according to procedures satisfactory to IDA?&#13;
&#13;
It will be implemented through existing institutions and used for strengthening the&#13;
national institutional framework. Local communities/populations will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation o f its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(Department o f Agricultural Services, National Agricultural Research Institute, National&#13;
Environment Agency, Department o f Planning, Department o f Health Services, N o n&#13;
Governmental Organizations and the Department o f Cooperatives) as well as with&#13;
institutions inother countries andrelevant regional institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               77&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistance to affected populations andto the monitoring o f efficient delivery. The detailed&#13;
Project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at the&#13;
start o fproject.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project i s part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates regardingthe future evolution o fthe infestation evolution and its impact on&#13;
agricultural communities. Relative emphasis among components and related finding&#13;
requirements will need to be regularly adjusted to fit with the actual evolution o f the&#13;
situation on the ground, and additional financial resources that may become available. To&#13;
this effect, the project coordinator will prepare detailedprograms, budgets and financing&#13;
plans every 6 months for discussion with the program Steering Committee andthe donors&#13;
finding government's program.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement    - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. Government o f Mali will&#13;
finance 100 percent o f (i) and duties (estimated at a rate o f 20 percent).The&#13;
                               taxes&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: about 52 percent o f the IDA Credit i s&#13;
expected to be disbursed duringIDA fiscal year 2005; 17 percent during fiscal year 2006,&#13;
16 percent during fiscal year 2007 and 15 percent duringfiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one Special Account. This Special Account&#13;
opened ina commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated Special Account. The advance to the Special Account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing finds from the Credit is the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMU will be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the special account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed CFAF500,000,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed    by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f&#13;
CFAF250,000,000 into the special account, representing approximately fifty percent o f&#13;
the authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             78&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount o f all&#13;
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed&#13;
the equivalent o f SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the special&#13;
account will be made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in&#13;
SOEs (Statement o f Expenditures) and/or on full documentationfor payments above SOE&#13;
thresholds. The special account will be used for all payments below twentypercent o f the&#13;
authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submitted on&#13;
a monthly basis. Ifineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special&#13;
account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts withdrawn. If the special&#13;
account remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to&#13;
refundthe amounts advancedto the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursementof the funds, ifreportingrequirements arenot complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less thanUS$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e) training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentationsupporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retainedby&#13;
PMU, andwill be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement andthe procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
All application for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticide, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
Task Team Leader (TTL), to determine if the project is eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;

The project will beunder the responsibility o fthe Ministryo fAgriculture.&#13;
&#13;

Producteurs -PASAOP")&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Assessment of theAgency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
Procurement activities will be carried out bythe PIUo f the PASAOP. The agency is staffed&#13;
by 6 high level staff and the Procurement unit is staffed by one procurement officer. A&#13;
Project Implementation Manual i s in place and refers, in addition to the procurement&#13;
procedures, to the SBDs to be used. In Mali, the central procurement control entity has&#13;
published SBDs under an IDF grant allocated by the Bank; those SBDs are also used when&#13;
applicable.&#13;
&#13;
An assessment o f the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement&#13;
actions for the project has been carried out by Cheick A. T. Traore, Procurement&#13;
Specialist inthe Country Office o f Mali, on November 4,2004. The assessment reviewed&#13;
the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the&#13;
project's staff responsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant central&#13;
unit for administration andfinance. The ProcurementOfficer has support from the central&#13;
unitfor administration and finance, andworks closelywith it.&#13;
&#13;
Most o f the issues/ risks concerning the procurement component for implementation o f&#13;
the project have beenidentified and include: a slight insufficiency in the preparation o f&#13;
procurement plans, some sections o f the bidding documents, inparticular the evaluation&#13;
criteria in the data sheet (for goods and for consultants selection), and the technical&#13;
specifications in the case o f goods. Actually the workload is sustainable in the&#13;
procurement unit, but inthe case o f a new project, it may happen some rushes from time&#13;
to time, andthen a need o fpunctual support may occur.&#13;
&#13;
The corrective measures which have been agreed are: training clinics (on the site) on the&#13;
issues that have been identified, anticipating on rushperiods andprovide the procurement&#13;
unitwithnecessary support staffinorder to avoid eventualdelays.&#13;
&#13;
The overall project risk for procurement is from highto medium.&#13;

        MAURITANIAEMERGENCY LOCUST PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I ProjectBackground&#13;
West Africa is facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastern Chad. The locust infestationwas first predictedby FA0 inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestation began inearly 2004 inNorthwest Africa and has now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.&#13;
&#13;
Mauritania is a permanentrecession area for locusts that live inthe dry Northern regions&#13;
o f the country. It is also a zone o f gregarious locust activity and the country has been&#13;
regularly affected by serious, sometimes devastating outbreaks. Four such outbreaks&#13;
occurred over the last 40 years (1968, 1974, 1987-88, and 1993-94). The first signs o f the&#13;
current infestation were detected in September 2003, with important swarms arriving&#13;
from the East, and immediate action was taken by the government. In total, 335,000 ha&#13;
were treated over an 11 months period, and by M a y 2004, the infestation was totally&#13;
suppressed. However, a second massive upsurge o f swarms (more than 200 large swarms&#13;
have been reported) coming from North Africa started inlate July 2004 and an estimated&#13;
1.6 million ha have again been infested, with massive damages to crops and pastures.&#13;
About 550,000 ha have been treated both through aerial spraying and ground treatments.&#13;
This has offered control, but not eradication o f the infestation. Numerous swarms have&#13;
now moved north into Northwest Sahara, the foothills o f the Atlas mountains inMorocco&#13;
and Algeria where intensive aerial and ground control operations were immediately&#13;
initiated. Other swarms have moved to the Cape Verde islands. However, swarms are&#13;
reproducing and migrating across borders following a so-called "circular migration"&#13;
between North Africa and the Sahelian zone, which causes multiple successive attacks&#13;
over two to three years as has happened in previous infestations. Mauritania will very&#13;
likely be affected by locust swarms moving back Southward over the winter and early&#13;
spring o f 2005, and it is expected that large areas will be affected again and will need to&#13;
betreated again in2005 andpossibly in2006.&#13;
&#13;
It is too early to have precise information on crop and pasture losses so far in 2004.&#13;
WFP/CILSS evaluation teams are completing field assessmentsthat will be available by the&#13;
end o fNovember 2004. However, it is already estimated that all main agricultural areas: the&#13;
Senegal Valley, the main rain fed areas, the imgated peri-urban horticulture, the oases and&#13;
range lands have suffered heavy damages. About 170 communes out o f 192 have been&#13;
affected and early projections indicate that crop losses may reach up to 50 percent on&#13;
average, and 100 percent inmany areas o f highlyproductive agriculture. Total agricultural&#13;
production may have decreased by 50 percent. There i s mounting evidence o f large scale&#13;
distress sales o f livestock because o fthe lack o fpasture and fodder. Inaddition, the lack o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               91&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
adequate fodder for the livestock has induced the premature migration o fherds to the south,&#13;
sometime through unusual routes, which will increase conflicts with local farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Although the impact o f the invasion on national food security is still being estimated, there&#13;
is no doubt that its impact at the household level will be devastating. Food prices, including&#13;
that o fmeat andmilk, have already doubled over the last few weeks, as well as animal feed.&#13;
Families inthe worst affected areas have lost up to 100percent o ftheir production. They are&#13;
thus destitute andneed emergency assistance. It i s estimated that up to 8,000 farm families&#13;
(800,000 persons) will need food aid as well as assistance to restore their productive assets&#13;
andhave accessto transitory employment andincomeopportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as demonstratedbyprevious infestations, the negative impact o f locust infestation i s&#13;
not only short-term. It reverberates for a number o f years on the national economy because&#13;
o fthe forced diversion o f scarce development resources to fighting the plague andthe wide-&#13;
spread destruction o f productive assets. There i s thus a immediate need to (i)      take all&#13;
necessarymeasuresto suppress anderadicate locust swarms when they return inearly 2005,&#13;
to prevent M e r damage and rural families being pushed into absolute poverty; and (ii)&#13;
assist affected populations to restore their productive capacity. There i s also a need for&#13;
buildingnational andregional capacities for locust surveillance, early warning, control and&#13;
mitigation, as well more generally to develop more effective strategies and mechanisms for&#13;
managing risks inrural areas.&#13;
&#13;
11.     GovernmentResponse, StrategyandProgram&#13;
Government Strategy - The government o f Mauritania, because the country i s a perennial&#13;
locust recession area, Inthe spring o f 2004, has always maintained a minimum capacity&#13;
for early warning and prevention and control. The National Locust Control Center&#13;
(NLCC) i s responsible for locust control operations. It.is adequately staffed and has&#13;
developed a strategy based on permanent surveillance and prevention based on an&#13;
extensive ground surveillance network (services o f the ministry o f agriculture and other&#13;
ministries, rural communities and herders, the army), climatic and satellite information&#13;
system, permanent effectivehntervention brigades (10). Incase o f infestation, the Center&#13;
can call upon a number o f trained reserve teams located in government services&#13;
throughout the country. During outbreaks, the NLCC i s transformed into a Central&#13;
Command Center incharge o f coordinating control activities under a multi-sectoral Task&#13;
Force headed by the Minister o f Rural Development. Finally, Mauritania maintain a&#13;
permanentresearch center at Aioun which has been selected to become a regional center&#13;
for locust research.&#13;
&#13;
Response - The permanent control capacity allowed Mauritania to react quickly to the&#13;
outbreaks in the fall o f 2003 and summer 2004. Domestic resources were quickly&#13;
overwhelmed and the international support rapidly requested by the government was&#13;
slow to mobilize. It (i)  conducted extensive field surveys; (ii) out sensitizations&#13;
                                                                    carried&#13;
and information campaigns for farmers and other stakeholders (press conferences,&#13;
informatiodinstruction bulletins to the farming communities and the general public for&#13;
the sighting andreporting o f DL); (iii) established 40 ground detectiodcontrol teams and&#13;
mobilized 17 planes and 1 helicopter for aerial spraying' (v) mobilized farmers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              92&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
volunteers for ground brigades; (vi) mobilized the national army for logistics and ground&#13;
operations; and (vii) acquired pesticides (600,000 l), spraying equipment (truck-mounted&#13;
and man-carried), communication equipment and protective gears for the locust control&#13;
teams. Finally, the government has organized weekly meetings with domestic and&#13;
external partners to mobilize and efficiently coordinate the needed assistance.        The&#13;
government also designed a detailed operational program for Locust control and the&#13;
restoration of agricultural assets and productivity in areas affected by locust invasion.&#13;
This program was presented at the Locust control Meeting, held in July 2004 Dakar,&#13;
Senegal. However, there was difficulties inquickly mobilizing the necessary logistics and&#13;
financial resources for fighting the latter given its magnitude. As a result, control&#13;
operations were inadequate in comparison with the magnitude o f the spring 2004&#13;
outbreak and, although they intensified considerably during the summer (field control&#13;
operations increased from 3,000 to 34,000 hdday) and the outbreak couldn't be&#13;
suppressed.&#13;
&#13;
111.    BankStrategy&#13;
Bank assistance will support Government's overall program. It will be provided under the&#13;
Bank's Emergency Procedures (OP/BP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust controVeradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
by other donors but its main focus will be on (i) rehabilitationo fdestroyed assets and&#13;
                                                 the&#13;
productive capacities o f affected populations [and the provision o f alternative sources o f&#13;
employment and revenues through cash-for-work publicly funded micro-projects and&#13;
infrastructure programs]; and (ii) strengthening o f capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
                                   the&#13;
warning systems and response mechanisms at national but also at regional levels, for&#13;
reducing the risk and potential social, economic and environmental impact o f future&#13;
infestations.&#13;
&#13;
IV.     The Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives - The overall objective o f the project i s to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve&#13;
the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate its impact on&#13;
the national economy and populations. The project i s fully in line with Mauritania&#13;
poverty reduction strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also fully in line with&#13;
NEPAD's Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes&#13;
betterdisaster preventiodmitigation andrisk management as one on the main instruments&#13;
for growth andpoverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i)&#13;
                                    an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized and IDA'Sresources including those o f the PPF); and(ii)  a medium-term&#13;
program aimed a strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
warning, response, mitigation, risk management and pesticide use and management. The&#13;
progrdproject includes four components:&#13;
&#13;
        EmergencyLocust Management (controVeradication andpesticide management);&#13;
        Emergency Assistance to affectedpopulations;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            93&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0  Strengthening o f early warning and response capacities;'&#13;
    0  Project management&#13;
&#13;
The project, like government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at risks&#13;
on the basis o f the on-going detailed assessment and future information from the&#13;
strengthened surveillance system. It has been designed on an emergency basis, on the&#13;
basis o f available, sometime incomplete information.       It is therefore likely that it will&#13;
need to be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will&#13;
require the establishment from the start o f the program o f an efficient monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have the following four components (the detailed description o f the&#13;
project i s presented inthe project implementationplan(PIP) and reflected inthe attached&#13;
detailed cost tables) :&#13;
&#13;
1. Component A - Emergency Locust Management - This component will support&#13;
    government activities increasingthe national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
                Tracking locust infestation, including inneighboring countries;&#13;
&#13;
                Increasing quick response capacity for effective control operations if an&#13;
                infestation does happen, as it aprbs likely, in the coming months:&#13;
                awarenesshnfonnation campaigns, training o f farming communities,&#13;
                transport and other equipment for locust detection and control brigades,&#13;
                emergency stocks o f pesticides, protection gear; telecommunication&#13;
                equipment, andrelated operatingcosts;&#13;
&#13;
                Carrying out immediate actual field controVeradicationoperations in early&#13;
                2005, and2006 ifnecessary;&#13;
&#13;
                Improving the management o f pesticides through: a detailed inventory o f&#13;
                locust control pesticides (to ensure that no banned chemicals re imported&#13;
                or used); the safe transport, packaging, storage and destruction o f locust&#13;
                control   pesticides,   in accordance        with international      standards&#13;
                (International Code o f Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B      - Emergency  Assistance to Affected Populations - This component will&#13;
    provide assistance to affected populations for the restoration o f their productive&#13;
    capacity and the provision o f temporary employmenthncome earning opportunities:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)     Restoration of productive capacity. This will be done through several&#13;
                approaches, based on careful targeting, depending on the specific&#13;
                characteristics o f the concerned areas and populations: through in kind&#13;
                assistance --distribution o f &lt;&lt; starter packs ))o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
                tools, animal feed, etc.) -- where necessary; the distribution o f a cash&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              94&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               allowance corresponding to the estimated cost o f the inputs necessary for&#13;
              resuming production (allowing beneficiaries to decide what to purchase&#13;

               cancellatiodrescheduling o f loans); and&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)   Provision of alternative employment opportunities. This will be done to&#13;
              provide affected populations with temporary income opportunities while&#13;
              normal income streams are restored through locally planned and managed&#13;
              cash for work programs targeted at collective infrastructure (feeder roads,&#13;
              damshigatioddrainage, bottomland development).&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C - Strengthening o f early Warning and Response Capacities - This&#13;
  component will support the strengthening o f national and regional capacities for&#13;
  locust infestation surveillance, control and mitigation; and the preparation o f national&#13;
  and regional strategies for the management of natural disasterdrisks in rural areas.&#13;
   Specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
              The sensitization and training o f farming communities/groups to locust&#13;
              andother pest detectionandcontrol;&#13;
&#13;
              The strengthening o f the national pest management services (additional&#13;
              human resources, constructiodrehabilitation o f facilities, specialized&#13;
              equipment) to ensure minimum efficiency and viability during remission&#13;
              periods and an adequate quick response capability incase o f emergency;&#13;
&#13;
              The implementation o f a strengthened research program on locust&#13;
              biological control and IPM, carried out through the national agricultural&#13;
              research system but also through participation (researchers, financial) in&#13;
              joint regional research programs carried out under CORAF coordination;&#13;
&#13;
              The     preparation   o f   a   comprehensive      national   natural    risk&#13;
              management/vulnerabilityreduction strategy to be integrated into Mali's&#13;
              overall PRSP andrural development strategy; and&#13;
&#13;
              The participation in collective activities at regional level such as an&#13;
              operationaVinstitutiona1audit o f the current regional system for locust and&#13;
              other pest management systems aimed at improving their efficiency and&#13;
              sustainability; and the design o f a regional mechanism for natural disaster&#13;
              risk management inrural areas (based on close integration between local,&#13;
              national andregional instruments).&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D - Project Management - The component will support the cost o fproject&#13;
  management unit (office rehabilitation and equipment, short-term consultancies,&#13;
  incremental operating costs),       including financial and technical audits,        and&#13;
  participation in coordination meetings at the regional level.      It will in particular&#13;
   finance the design, establishment and operations o f a comprehensive program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           95&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    monitoring and evaluation system (including economic, social and environmental&#13;
    impacts as well as cross boundaries issues) based on andfully integratedwith existing&#13;
    institutional andM&amp;E systems.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs andImpact - The overall achievement o fthe project will be monitored&#13;
through the following (outputhmpact) performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost includes the cost o f short-term activities which have been funded by the&#13;
PPF granted by IDA on September 22, 2004 which has also been used for the detailed&#13;
preparation o f Government's medium-term program presented below. It will be&#13;
refinancedunder Bank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
The project is part o f govemment's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i) magnitude of&#13;
                                                                         the&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; (ii) already mobilized and&#13;
                                                                the&#13;
committed financial support. It i s therefore likely that both its detailed design and its&#13;
fundingwill need to be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on the ground,&#13;
and additional financial resources that may become available. Its estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments inthe program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content, and reallocations of funds between components, will be done every year/as&#13;
necessary inclose cooperation with all fundingpartners, on the basis o f actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the monitoring and evaluation system that&#13;
will be established from the start o f the program). Un-necessaryhnused funds from the&#13;
IDA credit will becancelled at the endo ftheproject.&#13;
&#13;
FundingAlready Mobilized - So far, about US$16, 7 million have been mobilized from&#13;
international partners (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, The Gambia, Senegal, USAID, EU,&#13;
France and Italy) for the funding o f the 2004 control activities. FA0 has assisted the&#13;
govemment with technical operations, the mobilization o f external partners and the&#13;
procurement o f insecticides. Additional assistance i s being mobilized in support o f&#13;
Government medium-term program, including this IDA-fundedproject, to control o f the&#13;
current and projected infestation, provide assistance to affected populations and&#13;
strengthenthe country's permanent locust surveillance and control capacities. Assistance&#13;
has already been pledged, in addition to IDA, by USAID, EU, AfDB and France, among&#13;
others.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation - The Ministry o f Rural Development and Environment will be&#13;
responsible for project implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it&#13;
will be implemented under the guidance of the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control&#13;
Committee, chaired by the Minister o f Rural Development, which be enlarged to include&#13;
representatives from donors and the civil society. It will be implemented, like the overall&#13;
program, by the National locust Control Center (NLCC). A Project Coordinator will be&#13;
appointed within NLCC to manage and coordinate the activities o f the Project. The&#13;
Project Coordinator will be responsible for (i)  preparingdetailed implementation plans&#13;
and budgets, (ii)discussing these plans and budgets with participating donors; (iii)&#13;
supervising implementation activities; (iv) coordinating with regional institutions; and (v)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             96&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reporting on the use o f resources and results achieved. The PC will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the support o f all external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence in&#13;
the use o f all available resources, and for timely and accurate reporting. The&#13;
responsibilities and accountability o f the Project Coordinator will be detailed in a&#13;
performance contract agreed upon with the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee.&#13;
The financial management and procurement activities will be managed by the financial&#13;
and administrative unit o f the IDA-financed Projet de Development Intkgrk de&#13;
1'Agriculture Irriguke en Mauritanie (PDIAIM) which i s already established and&#13;
operating accordingto procedures satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
It will be implemented through existing institutions and used for strengthening the&#13;
national institutional framework. Local communities/populations             will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation o f its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(Department o f Agricultural Services, National Agricultural Research Institute, National&#13;
Environment Department, Department o f Planning, Department o f Health Services, and&#13;
Non Governmental Organizations) as well as with institutions in other countries and&#13;
relevant regional institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistanceto affectedpopulations and to the monitoring o f efficient delivery. The detailed&#13;
project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at the&#13;
start o fproject.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project i s part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates regardingthe future evolution o fthe infestation evolution and its impact on&#13;
agricultural communities. Relative emphasis among components and related funding&#13;
requirements will need to be regularly adjusted to fit with the actual evolution o f the&#13;
situation on the ground, and additional financial resources that may become available. To&#13;
this effect, the project coordinator will prepare detailed programs, budgets and financing&#13;
plansevery 6 months for discussion with the program Steering Committee and the donors&#13;
fundinggovernment's program.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement arrangements&#13;
Disbursement - All costs are inclusive o ftaxes and duties. Government o f Mauritaniawill&#13;
finance 100 percent of: (i)taxes and duties (estimated at a rate of 15 percent).The&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: about 70 percent o f the IDA Credit i s&#13;
expected to be disbursed duringIDA fiscal year 2005; 12percent during fiscal year 2006,&#13;
10percent during fiscal year 2007 and 8 percent during fiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one Special Account. This special account,&#13;
which will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               97&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated special account. The advance to the special account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing funds from the Credit is the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMU will be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the special account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed US$l,OOO,OOO covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed by IDA.Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f US$500,000&#13;
into the special account, representing approximately fifty percent o f the authorized&#13;
allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the aggregate amount o f&#13;
withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special&#13;
commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed the equivalent o f&#13;
SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the special account will be made&#13;
upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in SOEs (Statement o f&#13;
Expenditures) and/or on full documentation for payments above SOE thresholds. The&#13;
special account will be used for all payments below twenty percent o f the authorized&#13;
allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submittedon a monthly&#13;
basis. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special account,&#13;
the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts withdrawn. Ifthe special account&#13;
remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to refund the&#13;
amounts advanced to the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o f the funds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e) training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by&#13;
PMU, and will be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              98&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
All application for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the credit will be fwlly documented&#13;
for expenditures for pesticides, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
task team leader (TTL), to determine if the project i s eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - No withdrawals shall be made in respect of: (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date o f this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnishedto the Association a Pest Management&#13;
Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii)  for the purchase of&#13;
pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List; and (c) payments made under&#13;
category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
forth or referredto inthe Project ImplementationPlanand the provisions o fparagraph 13 o f&#13;
Schedule 4 ofthe Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Project account - This account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly in this account in accordance with project&#13;
needs.    To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, upon project effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
into the project account o f CFAF30,000,000 covering an estimated six months o f eligible&#13;
expenditures co-financed by the government.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Fiduciary responsibility will be under the PIUo f the Integrate Development Program for&#13;
Irrigated Agriculture (PDIAIM).&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements&#13;
Procurement would be managed by the Integrated Development Program for Irrigated&#13;
Agriculture (PDIAIM) which already has two procurement specialists and a financial&#13;
management specialist in its team. Consultants would be used as necessary to carry out&#13;
specific tasks.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Assessment of the Agency's Capacity to Implement&#13;
A procurement capacity assessment o fthe CAP was carried out as part o fthe institutional&#13;
analysis during the PDIAIM I1pre-appraisal mission in September 2004. The outcome&#13;
shows a sufficient procurement capacity to handle the new project procurement in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank Procedures. If needed, consultants will be hired for&#13;
specific tasks.&#13;

FinancialManagement Arrangements&#13;
The "Centre de Lutte Anti-Accridien - CLA" will host the project and thus establish an&#13;
autonomous and efficient financial management Unit within its current organization. This&#13;
Finance Department will be headed by a Financial Management Specialist (FMS)&#13;
supported by the existing accountants. The Finances Unit will be responsible for (a)&#13;
preparing activity plans, monthly Special Account (SA) reconciliation statement, and&#13;
quarterly Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs) Withdrawal Schedule, quarterly financial&#13;
monitoring reports (FMR), and annual financial statements; (b) ensuring that the project&#13;
financial management arrangements are acceptable to the Government and IDA; and&#13;
submittingtimelythese reports and statements to the GoM and IDA.&#13;
Flow of Funds. The overall project funding will consist o f IDA Credit and Counterpart&#13;
Funds. With respect to banking arrangements, IDA will disburse the credit through one&#13;
(1) Special Account (SA) opened andoperated bythe Center, CLA.&#13;
The following accounts will be maintained by each entity: (i)   SA inUS Dollars to which&#13;
the initial deposit and replenishments from IDA hnds will be lodged; and (ii)    Current&#13;
(Draw-down) Accounts in Ouguiyas to which drawdown from the SA will be credited&#13;
once or twice per month in respect o f incurred eligible expenditures. Following the&#13;
immediate payments o f eligible expenditures, the balance on these accounts should be&#13;
zero; (iii)a Current (Project) Account in Ouguiyas to which Counterpart Funds will be&#13;
deposited. Interest income will be deposited to the respective accounts.&#13;
Financial Reporting. Besides quarterly FMRs, all bank accounts will be reconciled with&#13;
bank statements on a monthly basis by the Finance Unit. A copy o f each bank&#13;
reconciliation statement together with a copy o f the relevant bank statement will be&#13;
reviewed regularly with the FMRs by the external Auditors.&#13;
The report-based disbursement method will applied only after a satisfactory assessment&#13;
carried out by the Bank FMS within the first twelve implementation months. Meanwhile,&#13;
the project will use the transaction-based disbursements procedures @.e. direct payment,&#13;
reimbursement, and special commitments), as described in the World Bank Disbursement&#13;
Handbook.&#13;
&#13;
The Center C L A will prepare and submit to IDA Audited Project Financial Statements&#13;
within six (6) months after year end. By Credit Effectiveness, independent and qualified&#13;
external auditors will be appointed on the basis o f Terms o f Reference (TORS)acceptable&#13;
to IDA. The auditors will audit the project accounts and financial statements in&#13;
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). The audit reports will&#13;
include a single opinion on (i)the Audited Project Financial Statements including&#13;
quarterly FMRs, (ii) accuracy and propriety o f expenditures made under the SOE&#13;
                       the&#13;
procedures and the extent to which these can be relied upon as a basis for loan&#13;
disbursements, (iii) andthe special account.&#13;
&#13;
Loan Conditions and Covenants&#13;
The conditions for credit effectiveness are: (a) Set up a FMSystem including a manual o f&#13;
financial &amp; administrative procedures and accounting software with information&#13;
management system and training provided to staff; (b) Special and Project Accounts&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
I. ProjectBackground&#13;
West Afiica i s facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastem Chad. The locust infestation was first predicted by FA0 inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestationbegan inearly 2004 inNorthwest Africa and has now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad).&#13;
&#13;
The first signs o f infestationinNiger were detected inearly 2003 inthe Northemregion&#13;
o f the country. The DL infestation became worse in July 2004. About 224,000 ha were&#13;
treated by the end o f October 2004. Despite the intensive control campaign, favorable&#13;
conditions are still prevailing in the following parts o f the country: north (Air and&#13;
Tamesna zones in Agadez region) and northwest (Tahoua region) and even west&#13;
(northern pastoral zones inTillabery region). Therefore at the end o f October new hopper&#13;
bands reinvaded the country. These hoppers could move toward Algeria, Libya, Chad and&#13;
even north andwestem Sudan. It i s estimated that between July and October 2004, locust&#13;
infestation has covered more than 750,000 ha and caused wide-spread crop and pasture&#13;
losses.&#13;
&#13;
Swarms are reproducing and migrating across borders following a so-called "circular&#13;
migration" between North Africa and the Sahelian zone, which may cause multiple&#13;
successive seasonal attacks over two to three years, as has happened in previous&#13;
infestations. Niger i s highly likely to continue being affected by Desert Locust (DL)&#13;
swarms that will start moving back Southward inthe winter and early spring o f 2005 and&#13;
that at least 700,000 ha may have to be treated again in 2005 and possibly half that area&#13;
in2006.&#13;
&#13;
It is too early to have details o f crop and pasture losses. However, the recent FAO/&#13;
WFP/CILLS food security situation assessment estimated that up to 100,000 tons o f cereals&#13;
may have been lost already due to the locust invasion (out o f a total shortfall of about&#13;
300,000 tons). This shortfall is also linked to the significant rain deficit experienced this year&#13;
inthe country. There is mounting evidence oflarge scale distress sales oflivestockbecause&#13;
o f the lack of pasture and fodder. Inaddition, the lack o f adequate fodder for livestock has&#13;
induced the premature migration of herds to the south, sometime through unusual routes,&#13;
which will increase conflicts with local fanners. Although the impact o f the invasion on&#13;
national food security is still being estimated, there i s no doubt that its impact at the&#13;
household level has been devastating. Families in the worst affected areas have lost up to&#13;
100% o f their production. They are thus destitute and need emergency assistance. It i s&#13;
estimated that up to 150,000 households (1,000,000 persons) will need food aid as well as&#13;
assistance to restore their productive assets and have access to transitory employment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
income opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as demonstrated byprevious infestations (1988, 1994), the negative impact o flocust&#13;
infestation is not only short-term. It reverberates for a number o f years on the national&#13;
economy because o f the forced diversion o f scarce development resources to fight the&#13;
plague and the wide-spread destruction o f productive assets. There is thus an immediate&#13;
need to (i)  take all necessary measures to suppress and eradicate locust swarms as they&#13;
return in early 2005 to prevent further damage and fixther rural families being pushed into&#13;
absolute poverty; and (ii)  help affected populations to restore their productive capacity.&#13;
There i s also a need to build national and regional capacity for locust surveillance, early&#13;
warning, control andmitigation, as well more generally to develop more effective strategies&#13;
andmechanisms for managing risks inrural areas.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Government Response, Strategy and Program&#13;
Government Strategy - The government o f Niger, with the support o f Food and&#13;
Agricultural Organization (FAO) and several other donors has taken early action for&#13;
efficiently mobilizing domestic and external resources for controlling and suppressing the&#13;
infestation. It (i)&#13;
                  reorganized and strengthened the national Locus control system to cover&#13;
adequately the infested areas (ii) re activated the existing"comite de concertation Etats-&#13;
donateurs pour la securite alimentaire" chaired by the Prime Minister. This committee&#13;
played a key role in mobilizing Government and donors; (iii)        conducted assessment&#13;
surveys to determine presence o f DL; (iv) carried out sensitizations campaigns for&#13;
farmers, herders and other stakeholders (press conferences, informatiodinstruction&#13;
bulletinsto the farmingcommunities and the general public for the sighting andreporting&#13;
o f DL); (iv) established 9 ground detectiodcontrol teams and mobilized 3 planes for&#13;
aerial campaign; (v) mobilized more than 11,500 farmers and volunteers for ground&#13;
brigades; (vi) acquired and distributed 273,000 liters o f pesticides including its own&#13;
stock. The national crops protection directorate ensures the coordination o f field&#13;
operations and regularly reports to the above mentioned committee on weekly basis. The&#13;
government also designed a detailed operational program for Locust control and the&#13;
restoration o f agricultural assets and productivity in areas affected by locust invasion.&#13;
This program was presented at the Locust control Meeting, heldinJuly 2004 Dakar.&#13;
&#13;
111.     Bank Strategy&#13;
Bankassistance will support Government's overall program. Itwill beprovidedunder the&#13;
Bank's Emergency Procedures (OPBP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust controVeradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
by other donors but its main focus will be on (i) rehabilitation o fdestroyed assets and&#13;
                                                  the&#13;
productive capacities o f affected populations [andthe provision o f alternative sources o f&#13;
employment and revenues through cash-for-work publicly funded micro-projects and&#13;
infrastructure programs]; and (ii) strengthening o f capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
                                    the&#13;
warning systems and response mechanisms at national but also at regional levels, for&#13;
reducing the risk and potential social, economic and environmental impact o f future&#13;
infestations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             110&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.     Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives - The overall objective o f the project i s to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve&#13;
the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate its impact on&#13;
the national economy and populations.        The project is fully in line with The Niger&#13;
poverty reduction strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also fully in line with&#13;
NEPAD's Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes&#13;
better disaster preventiodmitigation andrisk management as one on the main instruments&#13;
for growth andpoverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i)an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized and IDA'Sresources including those o fthe PPF); and (ii)  a medium-tenn&#13;
program aimed a strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
waming, response, mitigation, risk management and pesticide use and management. The&#13;
progradproject includes four components:&#13;
&#13;
        Emergency Locust Management (controVeradication and pesticide management);&#13;
        EmergencyAssistance to affected populations;&#13;
        Strengthening o f early warning and response capacities;'&#13;
        Project management&#13;
&#13;
The project, like government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at risks&#13;
in 6 of 8 Niger regions. It has been designed on an emergency basis, on the basis of&#13;
available, sometime incomplete information. It i s therefore likely that it will need to be&#13;
adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will require the&#13;
establishment from the start o f the program of an efficient monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
1. Component A - Emergency Locust Management - This component will support&#13;
    government activities increasingthe national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
        (0      Tracking locust infestation, including inneighboring countries;&#13;
&#13;
        (ii) Increasingquickresponsecapacityfor effectivecontroloperations ifan&#13;
                infestation does happen, as it appears likely, in the coming months:&#13;
                awarenesshnformation campaigns, training o f farming communities,&#13;
                transport and other equipment for locust detection and control brigades,&#13;
                emergency stocks o f pesticides, protection gear; telecommunication&#13;
                equipment, andrelated operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
        (iii) CarryingoutimmediateactualfieldcontroVeradicationoperationsinearly&#13;
                2005, andpossibly in2006 ;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             111&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      (iv)    Improving the management o f pesticides through: a detailed inventory o f&#13;
              locust control pesticides (to ensure that no banned chemicals re imported&#13;
              or used); the safe transport, packaging, storage and destruction o f locust&#13;
              control     pesticides, in accordance       with international     standards&#13;
              (International Code o f Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B - Emergency Assistance to Affected Populations - This component will&#13;
  provide assistance to affected populations for the restoration o f their productive&#13;
  capacity and the provision o f temporary employment/income earning opportunities:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)     Restoration of productive capacity. This will be done through several&#13;
              approaches, based on careful targeting, depending on the specific&#13;
              characteristics o f the concerned areas and populations: through in kind&#13;
              assistance --distribution o f ((starter packs))o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers,&#13;
              tools, animal feed, etc.)-where    necessary; through distribution o f a cash&#13;
              allowance corresponding to the estimated cost o f the inputs necessary for&#13;
              resuming production (allowing beneficiaries to decide what to purchase&#13;
              and where);&#13;
&#13;
      (ii)    Provision of alternative employment opportunities. This will be done to&#13;
              provide affected populations with temporary income opportunities while&#13;
              normal income streams are restored through locally planned and managed&#13;
              cash for work programs targeted at collective infrastructure (feeder roads,&#13;
              dams/irrigation/drainage, bottomland development, land management for&#13;
              collective trees plantingactivities).&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C - Strengthening o f early Warning and Response Capacities - This&#13;
   component will support the strengthening o f national and regional capacities for&#13;
   locust infestation surveillance, control and mitigation; and the preparation o f national&#13;
   and regional strategies for the management o f natural disasterdrisks in rural areas.&#13;
   Specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
      (9      The sensitization and training o f fanning communities/groups to locust&#13;
              and other pest detection and control;&#13;
&#13;
      (ii) Thestrengthening ofthenationalpestmanagement services (additional&#13;
              human resources, constructionhehabilitation o f facilities, specialized&#13;
              equipment) to ensure minimum efficiency and viability during remission&#13;
              periods and an adequate quick response capability incase o f emergency;&#13;
&#13;
      (iii) The implementation of a strengthened research program on locust&#13;
              biological control and IPM, carried out through the national agricultural&#13;
              research system (IER) but also through participation (researchers,&#13;
              financial) in joint regional research programs carried out under CORAF&#13;
              coordination;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            112&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        (iv)    The    preparation    o f   a   comprehensive      national   natural   risk&#13;
                managementhlnerability reduction strategy to be integrated into Niger's&#13;
                overall PRSP and rural development strategy; and&#13;
&#13;
        (v)     The participation in collective activities at regional level such as an&#13;
                operationaVinstitutiona1audit o f the current regional system for locust and&#13;
                other pest management systems aimed at improving their efficiency and&#13;
                sustainability; and the design o f a regional mechanism for natural disaster&#13;
                risk management inrural areas (based on close integration between local,&#13;
                national and regional instruments).&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D - Project Coordination and Management - The component will support&#13;
    the cost o f project management unit (office rehabilitation and equipment, short-term&#13;
    consultancies, incremental operating costs), including financial and technical audits,&#13;
    and participation in coordination meetings at the regional level. It will inparticular&#13;
    finance the design, establishment and operations o f a comprehensive monitoring and&#13;
    evaluation system (including economic, social and environmental impacts as well as&#13;
    cross boundaries issues) based on and fully integrated with existing institutional and&#13;
    M $ E systems.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Outputs and Impact - The overall achievement o f the project will be monitored&#13;
through the following (outputhmpact) performance indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost includes the cost o f short-term activities which have been funded by the&#13;
PPF granted by IDA on September 22, 2004 which has also been used for the detailed&#13;
preparation o f Government's medium-term program presented below. It will be&#13;
refinanced under Bank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
The project is part o f government's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i)      the magnitude o f&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; (ii)  the already mobilized and&#13;
committed financial support. It i s therefore likely that both its detailed design and its&#13;
fundingwill needto be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground,&#13;
and additional financial resources that may become available. Its estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments in the program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content, and reallocations o f funds between components, will be done every yeadas&#13;
necessary inclose cooperation with all funding partners, on the basis o f actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the monitoring and evaluation system that&#13;
will be established from the start o f the program). Un-necessaryhnused funds from the&#13;
IDA credit will be cancelledat the end o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Other Funding- Other funding has been provided by: FA0 US$300.000; AfDB UC2,5&#13;
million; EU 2,5 million euros and about US$4 million. Total contributions received to&#13;
date from domestic partners to date include amount in cash, fuel and pesticides at&#13;
national level amounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            113&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation - The Ministry o f Agriculture will be responsible for project&#13;
implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it will be implemented&#13;
under the guidance o f a steering committee chaired by the         "  Secretaire General du&#13;
Ministere de 1' Agriculture". The steering committee will include the        " Cellule Crise&#13;
Alimentaire" in which the main donors are represented, representatives from farmers&#13;
Organizations and NGOs. A Project Coordinator will be appointed within the Secretariat&#13;
o f Agriculture to manage and coordinate the activities o f the Project. The Project&#13;
Coordinator will be responsible for (i)      preparing detailed implementation plans and&#13;
budgets, (ii)discussing these plans and budgets with participating donors; (iii)&#13;
supervising implementation activities; (iv) coordinating with regional institutions; and (v)&#13;
and reporting on the use o f resources and results achieved. The financial management&#13;
and procurement activities will be implemented under the Community Action Program&#13;
(CAP)) which i s already established andoperating according to procedures satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. The PC will be responsible for coordinating the support o f all external donors,&#13;
ensuring coherence and transparence inthe use o f all available resources, and for timely&#13;
and accurate reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The Project will be implemented through existing institutions and usedfor strengthening&#13;
the national institutional framework. Local communities/populations will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation o f its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(Department o f Agricultural Services, National Agricultural Research Institute, National&#13;
Environment Agency, Department o f Planning, Department o f Health Services, N o n&#13;
Governmental Organizations and the Department o f Cooperatives) as well as with&#13;
institutions in other countries and relevant regional institutions for collective actions&#13;
concerning regional public goods. This i s inparticular the case for the proposed research&#13;
program which will be implemented with the national research institute and within a&#13;
regional CORAF network and insynergy with a CORAF member international institute.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistance to affectedpopulations andto the monitoring o f efficient delivery. The detailed&#13;
Project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project i s part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates regarding the future evolution o f the infestation and its impact on&#13;
agricultural communities. Relative emphasis among components and related finding&#13;
requirements will need to be regularly adjusted to fit with the actual evolution o f the&#13;
situation on the ground, and additional financial resources that maybecome available,&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. Government o f Niger will&#13;
finance 100percent o f (i) and duties (estimated at a rate o f 20%).The disbursement&#13;
                            taxes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              114&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
schedule is expected to be as follows: about 80 percent o f the IDA Credit i s expected to&#13;
be disbursed during IDA fiscal year 2005; 12 percent during fiscal year 2006, 4 percent&#13;
duringfiscal year 2007 and4 percent duringfiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one Special Account. This Special Account&#13;
opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds of the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated Special Account. The advance to the Special Account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing funds from the Credit is the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMU will be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the special account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed CFAF500,000,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f&#13;
CFAF250,000,000 into the Special Account, representing approximately fifty percent of&#13;
the authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
aggregate amount of withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount of all&#13;
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed&#13;
the equivalent of SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the special&#13;
account will be made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization of the advance, reflected in&#13;
SOEs (Statement of Expenditures) and/or on full documentation for payments above SOE&#13;
thresholds. The special account will be used for all payments below twenty percent o fthe&#13;
authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submitted on&#13;
a monthly basis. Ifineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special&#13;
account, the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts withdrawn. Ifthe special&#13;
account remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to&#13;
refknd the amounts advanced to the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement of the funds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            115&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e) training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by&#13;
PMU, andwill be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement andthe procedures definedinthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
All application for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticide, regardless o f the amount.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
Task Team Leader (TTL), to determine if the project i s eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - No withdrawals shall be made in respect of: (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date o f this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
 category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnished to the Association a Pest Management&#13;
 Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii) the purchase o f&#13;
                                                                       for&#13;
 pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List; and (c) payments made under&#13;
 category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
 forth or referredto inthe Project ImplementationPlanandthe provisions o fparagraph 13 o f&#13;
 Schedule 4 o fthe Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
 Project account - This account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
 Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly in this account in accordance with project&#13;
 needs. To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
 services, upon project effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
 into the project account o f CFAF30,000,000 covering an estimated six months o f eligible&#13;
 expenditures co-financed bythe government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Procurement would bemanaged by the Community Action Program Project (CAP) which&#13;
already has a procurement specialist and a financial management specialist in it's team.&#13;
Consultants would be used as necessary to carry out specific tasks.&#13;
&#13;
Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained&#13;
bythe Borrower for ex-post review by auditors andIDAsupervisionmissions.&#13;
&#13;
The PIU will work closely with the all the other partners involved in the project&#13;
implementation. The CAP will also be primarily responsible for reporting on Project&#13;
progress,   financial management,      procurement     and      disbursement,   identifying&#13;
implementation gaps and bottlenecks, and managingProject accounts and budget.&#13;
&#13;
Manual of Procedures. The financial and administrative manual in use by the CAP will&#13;
be adapted as needed inorder to respond to the specificity o f the Locust Project.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementpackagepreparation. All procurement package s will be prepared bythe&#13;
Procurement Specialist o fthe PIU. All procurement will be carried out inaccordance&#13;
with the procurementplan and as agreedwith the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Assessment of theAgency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
A procurement capacity assessment o fthe CAP was carried out as part o fthe institutional&#13;
analysis during the appraisal mission in October 2004. The outcome shows a sufficient&#13;
procurement capacity to handle the new project procurement in accordance with the&#13;
World Bank procedures.&#13;

           SENEGALEMERGENCYLOCUST PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I. ProjectBackground&#13;
West Africa i s facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastern Chad. The locust infestation was first predicted by FA0 inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestationbegan inearly 2004 inNorthwest Africa andhas now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad).&#13;
&#13;
The first signs of infestation in Senegal were detected in June 2004 in the Northem&#13;
region o f the country. It i s estimated that between June and October 2004, locust&#13;
infestation covered more than 920,000 ha where it caused wide-spread crop and pasture&#13;
losses in eight o f the eleven regions o f the country. Swarms are reproducing and&#13;
migrating across borders following a so-called "circular migration" between North Africa&#13;
and the Sahelian zone, which may cause multiple successive seasonal attacks over two to&#13;
three years as has happened inprevious infestations. Senegal is likely to be affected again&#13;
by Desert Locust (DL) swarms that will start moving back Southward inthe winter and&#13;
early spring o f 2005 and at least 600,000 ha may have to be treated again in 2005 and&#13;
possibly halfthat area in2006.&#13;
&#13;
It is too early to have precise estimates o f crop and pasture losses so far. However, it is&#13;
already estimated that up to 320,000 tons o f cereals may have been lost already due to the&#13;
locust invasion. There i s mounting evidence o flarge scale distress sales o f livestock because&#13;
o f the lack o f pasture and fodder. Inaddition, the lack o f adequate fodder for livestock has&#13;
induced the premature migration o f herds to the south, sometime through unusual routes,&#13;
which will increase conflicts with local farmers. Although the impact o f the invasion on&#13;
national food security i s still being estimated, there i s no doubt that its impact at the&#13;
household level has been devastating. Because o f the specific characteristics o f locust&#13;
damage. Families inthe worst affected areas have lost up to 70 percent o f their production&#13;
and are thus destitute. It is estimated that up to 10percent rural households will be affected&#13;
and therefore will need food aid as well as assistanceto restore their productive assets and&#13;
have access to transitory employment andincome opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, as demonstratedbypreviousinfestations (1988, 1994), the negative impact o f locust&#13;
infestation is not only short-term. It reverberates for a number o f years on the national&#13;
economy because o f the forced diversion o f scarce development resources to fight the&#13;
plague and the wide-spread destruction o f productive assets. There i s thus an immediate&#13;
need to (i)  take all necessary measures to suppress and eradicate locust swarms as they&#13;
return in early 2005 to prevent fkther damage and more rural families being pushed into&#13;
absolute poverty; and (ii)    help affected populations to restore their productive capacity.&#13;
There is also a need to build national and regional capacity for locust surveillance, early&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              128&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
warning, control, andmitigation, as well more generally to develop more effective strategies&#13;
andmechanisms for managingrisks inruralareas.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Government Response, Strategy and Program&#13;
Government Strategy - In June 2004, on the basis o f the lessons learned and following&#13;
consultations with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Government o f&#13;
Senegal has taken early action for efficiently mobilizing domestic and external resources&#13;
for controlling and suppressing the infestation. It (i)established a National Locust&#13;
Control Committee, chaired by the Minister o f Agriculture, to coordinate government&#13;
action and mobilize resources; (ii)  conducted surveys to determine presence o f DL; (iii)&#13;
carried out sensitizations campaigns for farmers and other stakeholders (press&#13;
conferences, informatiodinstruction bulletins to the farming communities and the general&#13;
public for the sighting and reporting o f DL); (iv) established 50 ground detectiodcontrol&#13;
teams and mobilized 20 planes for aerial spraying' (v) mobilized farmers through about&#13;
2800 locust control village committees; (vi) mobilized the national army for logistics and&#13;
ground operations; and (vii) acquired (521,000 liters and 414 tons) and distributed&#13;
(43 1,000 liters and 324 tons) pesticides, spraying equipment (53 truck-mounted and&#13;
1,500 man-carried), communication equipment and protective gears for the locust control&#13;
teams. In each region of the country operational command posts headed by the Regional&#13;
Governor coordinated field operations. Finally, the government has organized weekly&#13;
meetings with domestic and external partners: FAO, UNDP, EU, Ambassadors,&#13;
international development institutions, NGOs, the public andprivate sectors -to mobilize&#13;
and efficiently coordinate the needed assistance. The government also designed a detailed&#13;
emergency action plan for Locust control and the restoration o f agricultural assets and&#13;
productivity in areas affected by locust invasion. Mali hosted the second Agriculture&#13;
Ministers Conference was held in July 2004 Dakar, and addressed in particular Locust&#13;
control regional issues. As a result, control activities have intensified and it i s estimated&#13;
that more than 600,000 hectares o f infested landhave so far been treated. The infestation&#13;
has beentemporarily brought under control,&#13;
&#13;
111.    Bank Strategy&#13;
Bank assistancewill support Government's overall program. It will be provided under the&#13;
Bank's Emergency Procedures (OP/BP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust controVeradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
by other donors but its mainfocus will be on (i) rehabilitation o f destroyed assets and&#13;
                                                  the&#13;
productive capacities o f affected populations and the provision o f alternative sources o f&#13;
employment and revenues through cash-for-work publicly funded micro-projects and&#13;
infrastructure programs; and (ii)  the strengthening o f capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
warning systems and response mechanisms at national but also at regional levels, for&#13;
reducing the risk and potential social, economic and environmental impact o f future&#13;
infestations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IV.     Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives - The overall objective o f the project is to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           129&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate its impact on&#13;
the national economy and populations. The project is fully in line with the Senegal&#13;
poverty reduction strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also fully in line with&#13;
NEPAD's Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes&#13;
better disaster preventiodmitigation andrisk management as one on the main instruments&#13;
for growth andpoverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
The project will be an integral part o f a national program funded by all donors in a&#13;
coordinated fashion. It includes: (i) an emergency phase (2004-2005, funded by resources&#13;
already mobilized and IDA'Sresources including those o f the PPF); and (ii) a medium-term&#13;
program aimed a strengthening national and regional capacities for surveillance, early&#13;
warning, response, mitigation, risk management andpesticideuse andmanagement.&#13;
The proposed projectwould includefour components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Emergency Locust control andpesticide management;&#13;
    0  Restoration o f agriculture productive capacities and emergency assistance to&#13;
        affectedpopulations;&#13;
        Strengthening o f capacities inforecasting, early warning, response and mitigation&#13;
        (including regional cooperation);&#13;
    0   Programmanagement.&#13;
&#13;
The project, like government's overall program, will focus on areas particularly at risks&#13;
inthe eight affected regions. It has beendesignedon an emergency basis, on the basis of&#13;
available, sometime incomplete information. It i s therefore likely that it will need to be&#13;
adjusted to fit the actual evolution o f the situation on the ground. This will require the&#13;
establishment from the start o f the program o f an efficient monitoring and evaluation&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectComponents&#13;
The project will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
1. Component A - Emergency Locust Control - This component will support&#13;
    government activities increasing the national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
        (i) Increasing quick response capacity for effective emergency control&#13;
                operations:   awarenesdinformation campaigns,        training o f farming&#13;
                communities, transport and other equipment for locust detection and&#13;
                control brigades, emergency stocks o f pesticides, protection gear,&#13;
                telecommunication equipment, and related emergency operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
          (ii)Improvingthemanagementofpesticidesthrough:adetailedinventoryof&#13;

        (iii)Ecotoxicmonitoringandimpactevaluationofspraying,andmitigation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Component B - Restoration o f Populations Productive Capacities        -This component&#13;
  will provide assistanceto potentially affected populations through:&#13;
&#13;
             the carrying out o f a detailed production losses assessment and the&#13;
             development o f targeting mechanisms;&#13;
&#13;
             the restorationo fthe seedproduction capacity o f the Bambey station;&#13;
&#13;
             the distribution o f    ((starter packs ))o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools,&#13;
             animal feed, etc.) to maintainhestore the productive capacities o f the&#13;
             affected farmers and herders; and&#13;
&#13;
             the undertaking o f labor intensive collective productive micro-projects&#13;
             (dams, irrigatioddrainage,         bottomland    development),     to    provide&#13;
             alternative sources o f employment and cash revenues until the normal&#13;
             income streams are restored.&#13;
&#13;
3. Component C - Strengthening o f National Capacities - This component will support&#13;
  the strengthening o f national capacities, and o f the regional capacities for undertaking&#13;
  collective action. specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
             surveillance/early warning, control and mitigation o f locust infestations,&#13;
             including inneighboring countries;&#13;
&#13;
             the sensitization andtraining o f farming communities/groups to locust/pest&#13;
             detection and control;&#13;
&#13;
             the complementary equipment o f the national pest management services&#13;
             (constructionhehabilitation      o f facilities, specialized equipment, in&#13;
             particular for the Richard Toll station) and the training, o f its staff;&#13;
&#13;
             the implementation o f research and development programs on Locust&#13;
             biological control and IPM, inparticular through participation into ajoint&#13;
             regional researchprogram under C O W .&#13;
&#13;
4. Component D- Project Management and Coordination - The component will support:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)    the cost o f project coordinating unit (office rehabilitation and equipment,&#13;
             short-term consultancies, incrementaloperating costs);&#13;
&#13;
      (ii) financialandtechnicalaudits;&#13;
&#13;
      (iii)  training, workshops, study tours, and coordination meetings at the regional&#13;
             level;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             131&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       (iv)    the design, establishment and operations o f a comprehensive Government&#13;
               program monitoring and evaluation system (including economic, social&#13;
               and environmental impacts as well as cross boundaries issues) based on&#13;
               and fully integratedwith existing institutional and M&amp;E systems;&#13;
&#13;
       (v)     technical assistance and studies to: (i) develop a comprehensive national&#13;
               natural risk management/vulnerabilityreduction system for the rural sector&#13;
               to be integrated into the Senegal overall PRSP and rural development&#13;
               strategy;   and (ii)strengthen the close          integration o f national&#13;
               programs/activities into the regional framework for locust and other pest&#13;
               management systems.&#13;
&#13;
The total cost includes the cost o f short-term activities which have been fimded by the&#13;
PPF granted by IDA on September 22,2004. The PPF has also beenused for the detailed&#13;
preparation of Government's medium-term program presented below. It will be&#13;
refinanced under Bank's credit.&#13;
&#13;
The project i s part o f government's overall program. It has been designed, on an&#13;
emergency basis, on the basis o f available information regarding (i) magnitude o f&#13;
                                                                          the&#13;
actual and projected infestations and affected populations; (ii) the already mobilized and&#13;
committed financial support. It is therefore likely that both its detailed design and its&#13;
fimdingwill need to be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on the ground,&#13;
and additional financial resources that may become available. Its estimated cost includes&#13;
important physical contingencies. Readjustments inthe program's emphasis and detailed&#13;
content, and reallocations o f funds between components, will be done every yeadas&#13;
necessary in close cooperation with all fundingpartners, on the basis o f actual needs and&#13;
developments on the ground (as tracked by the monitoring and evaluation system that&#13;
will be established from the start o f the program). Unnecessary/unused funds fi-om the&#13;
IDAcredit willbe cancelledat the endo fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Other Funding - Total contributions to Senegal's Program against Desert Locust&#13;
estimated about US$39 million, was provided by: Government (US$9 million); other&#13;
donors as direct contribution (US$12.5 million) or through FA0 trust Fund (US$25&#13;
million), It was estimated in June 2004 that the cost o f Government short term&#13;
preparedness activities (until end-December 2004) described above will amount to&#13;
US$4.9 million, but the invasion spread dramatically well beyond the 300.000 high case&#13;
hypothesis. So did the needs to address the situation. Total contributions received to date&#13;
from domestic partners to date amount in cash, fuel and pesticides at national level&#13;
amounts to US$1.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation. The Ministry o f Agriculture will be responsible for project&#13;
implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it will be implemented&#13;
under the guidance o f the National Locust Control Committee which be enlarged to&#13;
include representatives from rural elected bodies and the civil society. A Project&#13;
Coordinator will be appointed within the Department o f Plant Protection to manage and&#13;
coordinate the activities o f the Project. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              132&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
preparing detailed implementation plans and budgets, (ii)      discussing these plans and&#13;
budgets with participating donors; (iii)supervising implementation activities; (iv)&#13;
coordinating with regional institutions; and (v) and reporting on the use o f resources and&#13;
results achieved. The financial management and procurement activities will be managed&#13;
bythe PSAOPFiduciary Unit at the Ministryo fFinance which is already established and&#13;
operating according to procedures satisfactory to IDA. The PC will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the support o f all external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence in&#13;
the use o f all available resources, and for timely and accurate reporting. The&#13;
responsibilities and accountability o f the Project Coordinator will be detailed in a&#13;
performance contract agreed uponwith the Inter-Ministerial Locust Control Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention will be given to the detailed mechanism for targeting project&#13;
assistanceto affected populations and to the monitoring o f efficient delivery. The detailed&#13;
Project/program Implementation Plan (PIP), including the detailed targeting system, and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&amp;E) will be agreed upon and established at the&#13;
start o fproject.&#13;
&#13;
It will be implemented through existing institutions and used for strengthening the&#13;
national institutional framework. Local communities/populations will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation of its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(National Agricultural Research Institutes, National Environment Agency, Department o f&#13;
Planning, Department o f Health Services, Non Governmental Organizations, ANCAR,&#13;
and ASPRODEP) as well as with institutions in other countries and relevant regional&#13;
institutions for collective actions concerning regional public goods. This i s inparticular&#13;
the case for the proposed research and development program to promote Locust control&#13;
bio-pesticides and IPMapproaches.&#13;
&#13;
As already mentioned, the project is part o f government's overall locust emergency&#13;
management program, and has been designed on the basis o f available information and&#13;
best estimates regardingthe future evolution o fthe infestation evolution and its impact on&#13;
agricultural communities. Relative emphasis among components and related hnding&#13;
requirements will need to be regularly adjusted to fit with the actual evolution o f the&#13;
situation on the ground, and additional financial resources that may become available. To&#13;
this effect, the project coordinator will prepare detailed programs, budgets and financing&#13;
plans every 6 months for discussion with the program Steering Committee and the donors&#13;
fundinggovernment's program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. Government o f Senegal will&#13;
finance 100 percent o f (i)taxes and duties (estimated at a rate o f 10 percent).The&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: about 53 percent o f the IDA Credit is&#13;
expected to be disbursed during IDA fiscal year 2005; 23 percent during fiscal year 2006,&#13;
13 percent during fiscal year 2007 and 11percent during fiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             133&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one Special Account. This Special Account,&#13;
which should be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated Special Account. The advance to the Special Account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA'S share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing funds from the Credit i s the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA'S&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMU will be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the special account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed CFAF500,000,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed by IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, IDA will deposit the amount o f&#13;
CFAF250,000,000 into the special account, representing approximately fifty percent o f&#13;
the authorized allocation. The remaining balance will be made available when the&#13;
aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount o f all&#13;
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association shall be,equalor exceed&#13;
the equivalent o f SDR3,000,000. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the special&#13;
account will be made upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in&#13;
SOEs (Statement o fExpenditures) andor on full documentation for payments above SOE&#13;
thresholds. The special account will be usedfor all paymentsbelow twenty percent o f the&#13;
authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submitted on&#13;
a monthly basis. Ifineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special&#13;
account, the Borrower will be obligated to refind the amounts withdrawn. Ifthe special&#13;
account remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to&#13;
refundthe amounts advanced to the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected in the Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o f the finds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - The following expenses can be submitted on a SOE&#13;
basis: (a) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$500,000 for works; (b)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c)&#13;
contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less&#13;
than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (e)           training, Micro-Grants and&#13;
incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on the basis o f SOEs.&#13;
Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by&#13;
PMU, and will be available for review when requested by IDA supervision missions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            134&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
auditors. All disbursements are subject to the conditions o f the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
All application for the withdrawal of proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticide, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
&#13;
When project implementationbegins, the quarterly Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR). Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
task team leader (TTL), to determine if the project i s eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - No withdrawals shall be made in respect of: (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnished to the Association a Pest Management&#13;
Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii)  for the purchase o f&#13;
pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List; and (c) payments made under&#13;
category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
forth or referred to inthe Project ImplementationPlanandthe provisions of paragraph 13 o f&#13;
Schedule 4 o fthe Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Project account - This account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Counterpart funds will be deposited regularlyin this account in accordance with project&#13;
needs. To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, upon project effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
into the project account o f CFAF30,000,000 covering an estimated six months o f eligible&#13;
expenditures co-financed by the government.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
Fiduciary aspects will be managed by three implementing agencies: Direction de la&#13;
Protection des Vegetaux (DPV) from the Ministry o f Agriculture, ANCAR and&#13;
ASPRODEB.&#13;
&#13;
The fiduciary aspects, including Procurement, will follow the same arrangement as for&#13;
the Projet de Services Agricoles &amp; Organisation de Producteurs (PSAOP). Thus, the&#13;
quality control of procurement documents o f all the components will be under the&#13;
responsibility o f the Procurement Specialist o f the Division de la Dette et des&#13;
Investissements (DDI) of the Ministry o f Finance, whom will also act as Procurement&#13;
Specialist for the DPV's implementing agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            135&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Procurementwould be managed bythe three implementing agencies: Direction de la&#13;
Protection des Vegetaux (DPV) from the Ministryo f Agriculture, ANCAR and&#13;
ASPRODEB.&#13;
&#13;
ANCAR andASPRODEB already have procurement specialist intheir team with good&#13;
experience andqualification inprocurement while they are also implementingthe&#13;
PSAOPproject.&#13;
&#13;
DPVhas not aprocurement specialist. However, the Procurement Specialist o fthe DDI&#13;
inthe MinistryofFinancewill act asprocurement officer for DPV.&#13;
&#13;
Since fiduciary aspects, including Procurement, will follow the same arrangements as for&#13;
the Projet de Services Agricoles &amp; Organisationde Producteurs (PSAOP), the quality&#13;
control o f procurement documents o f all the components will be under the responsibility&#13;
o f the Procurement Specialist o f the Division de laDette et des Investissements (DDI) o f&#13;
the Ministry o f Finance.&#13;
&#13;
Documents relatedto procurement below the prior review thresholds will bemaintained&#13;
bythe Borrower for ex-post review by auditors andIDAsupervisionmissions.&#13;
&#13;
The components implementing agencies will work closely with the Coordinator o f the&#13;
Project located inthe Ministryo fAgriculture.&#13;
&#13;
Underproject coordinator's supervision, the implementingagencies will also be&#13;
responsible for reporting on Projectprogress, financial management, procurement and&#13;
disbursement, identifyingimplementationgaps andbottlenecks, andmanagingProject&#13;
accounts andbudget.&#13;
&#13;
Manual of Procedures. The financial and administrative manual inuse by the PSAOP&#13;
will be adapted as needed inorder to respond to the specificity o fthe Locust Project.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Summary of Assessment of theAgency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
The procurement capacity assessment o f each o f the three Procurement Specialist (one&#13;
for each implementing agency) shows a sufficient procurement capacity to handle the&#13;
new project procurement in accordance with the World Bank procedures, since these PS&#13;
are working for the PSAOP for several years, their evaluation under PSAOP i s positive&#13;
and they have attended several trainings inprocurement.&#13;

Readinessfor implementation and level of capacity of the Management Unit&#13;
Based on the capacity assessment, it i s considered that the project has enough capacity&#13;
and it i s ready for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
The accounting unit o fthe PSAOPwill be incharge o fthe implementation o fthe project.&#13;
The project will then benefit from their experience on managing IDA funds. The&#13;
accounting unit o f PSAOP i s comprised o f a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and an&#13;
assistant.&#13;
&#13;
The CFO has, as far as financial management is concerned, the responsibility to collect&#13;
and control invoices, manage the project's bank accounts, keep the books o f accounts and&#13;
prepare the financial reports.&#13;
According to general financing mechanism in Senegal, the director DDI (Direction de la&#13;
Dette et de 1'Investissement) who received delegation o f expenditures authorization&#13;
functions from the Ministryo f Economy and Finance, will manage the special account o f&#13;
the project. However, all the supporting documentation justifying the use o f funds will be&#13;
prepared andkept by the accounting unit.&#13;
&#13;
Given the workload, there is need to strengthen the system by recruiting an accountant&#13;
who will be incharge o f maintainingthe books, entering data inthe system andpreparing&#13;
all the accounting information under the supervision o fthe CFO.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
A procedures manual will be developed and will provide all the required details on&#13;
accounting and financial procedures. It will set out in particular the flow o f accounting&#13;
and financial information between the accountingunit o fPSAOP andthe beneficiaries, as&#13;
well as the modalities and formats o fperiodic reports. An overview o f funding flows and&#13;
cash management mechanisms i s provided inthe paragraph on disbursements.&#13;
In terms of budgets, each year the beneficiaries will draw up a detailed budget for&#13;
activities to be carried out. This budget will be consolidated by the accounting unit o f&#13;
PSAOP and after its validation by the Coordinator in a meeting o f the management&#13;
committee, will be submitted to the World Bank for review and then to the steering&#13;
committee for approval.&#13;
&#13;
The beneficiaries will be responsible o f the technical execution o f the activities. They&#13;
will submit all the documents to the accountingunit o fPSAOP for review andpayments.&#13;
They will also be responsible o f the procurement process. The procurement specialist o f&#13;
PSAOP will review the quality o f the documents before payments. A monthly activity&#13;
report will be produced by the accounting unit o f PSAOP with the support o f the&#13;
beneficiaries. This report will, in particular, summarize the status o f financial and&#13;
technical execution and the volume o f procurement for the month ended, and will also&#13;
contain forecasts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

        Credit, and explains variances betweenthe actual andplanneduses o f such finds;&#13;
        Describes physical progress inProject implementation, bothcumulatively andfor&#13;
        the period covered by said report, andexplains variances betweenthe actual and&#13;
        planned Project implementation ;and&#13;
        Sets forth the status o fprocurement under the Project, as at the end o f the period&#13;
        covered by said report.&#13;
&#13;
The first FMR shall be fumished to the Bank not later than 45 days after the end o f the&#13;
first calendar quarter after the Effective Date, and shall cover the period from the&#13;
incurrence o f the first expenditure under the Project through the end o f such first calendar&#13;
quarter; thereafter, each FMR shall be furnished to the Bank not later than 45 days after&#13;
each subsequent calendar quarter, andshall cover such calendar quarter.&#13;
Inthe area ofreporting, the Project Coordinator will also berequiredto produce, no later&#13;
than June 30 o f the following fiscal year, audited annual financial statements. These&#13;
financial statements will be subject to periodic audits (see paragraph on audits). Formats&#13;
for the FMRs and financial statements will be defined in the procedures manual. The&#13;
format o f the FMRswill be confirmed duringnegotiations.&#13;
&#13;
Information System&#13;
A sound computerizedinformation system is already established at PSAOP.&#13;
This system will be updated in such a way as to fumish all o f the above data, in addition&#13;
to providing analytical accounting for purposes o f monitoring beneficiaries, and&#13;
particularly ex-combatants andtarget groups.&#13;
&#13;
External Audits&#13;
An annual audit o f the project will be conducted by external auditors with qualifications&#13;
and experience satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
This audit will, on the one hand, be o f normal scope interms o f providing an opinion on&#13;
annual financial statements, and its scope will also be broadened to cover the specific&#13;
activities o f component related to the Grant to fanners. The auditor will be required to&#13;
ensure that the grant payment procedures described in the procedures manual have been&#13;
observed and that the duly identified beneficiaries have received the funds to which they&#13;
are entitled. The auditor will express a special opinion on this point.&#13;
&#13;
The audit report for the fiscal year ended must be submitted no later than June 30&#13;
following the end o f that fiscal year.&#13;

West Africa is facing its worst locust infestation in 15 years, spreading from the Atlantic&#13;
coast to eastern Chad. The locust infestation was first predictedby FA0inOctober 2003.&#13;
Significant infestation beganinearly 2004 inNorthwest Africa and has now spread to all&#13;
Sahelian countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.&#13;
&#13;
After a late start, at least in Sahelian countries, control operations have intensified over&#13;
the summer and it is estimated that more than 2 million ha o f infested land have so far&#13;
been treated. As a result, the infestation has been suppressed and the situation has&#13;
improved in the Southern areas o f the Sahel where vegetation is rapidly drying up.&#13;
Numerous swarms have left andmovednorth into northwest Mauritania, Western Sahara,&#13;
and the foothills o f the Atlas mountains in Morocco and Algeria where intensive aerial&#13;
and ground control operations were immediately initiated. Other swarms have moved to&#13;
the Cape Verde islands, northernMali andNiger, and southern Algeria.&#13;
&#13;
The Gambia has so far been spared o f any infestation, and the danger appears to be&#13;
receding for the remainder o f 2004 period. However, swarms are reproducing and&#13;
migrating across borders following a so-called "circular migration" betweenNorthAfrica&#13;
andthe Sahelian zone, which may cause multiple successive seasonal attacks over two to&#13;
three years as has happened in previous infestations. It is already predicted that swarms&#13;
will move back to the Southern part o fthe Sahelian zone inthe winter and early springo f&#13;
2005 and there i s a significant risk that the infestation will reach The Gambia as well as&#13;
the Northernparts o f Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, C6te d'Ivoire, andNigeria.&#13;
&#13;
The Gambia i s mostly likely to be affected by Desert Locust (DL) swarms that become&#13;
involved in the so-called Southern Circuit migration. This occurs during the late winter&#13;
period when a portion o f the swarms that have re-formed inthe Sahel (Mauritania- Chad)&#13;
move first west then south into Senegal and The Gambia. This movement can start&#13;
around November and continues into February/April2005, which will be the most critical&#13;
period for The Gambia.&#13;
&#13;
In 1988, The Gambia experienced a devastating Desert Locust invasion. The country was&#13;
totally unprepared to control the upsurge which resulted in severe economic damage and&#13;
crop losses and destroyed the productive assets of a large number o f poor agricultural&#13;
families, pushing them hrther into poverty, Again during the 1992-1994 regional&#13;
outbreak, swarms invaded The Gambia in February 1994,and, although the infestation&#13;
was less severe than in 1988, caused significant damage and crop losses, again due to a&#13;
lack o f institutional andhuman resource capacities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             149&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The most urgent action required now i s to strengthen national capacity (capacity building&#13;
for all stakeholders in monitoring and control in case o f attacks to provide emergency&#13;
assistance to affected farmers to recover their crop losses) combined with sub-regional&#13;
intervention mechanisms for aerial sprayingbases ineach country.&#13;
&#13;
I1      Government Response, Strategy and Program&#13;
Government Strategy - In May 2004, on the basis o f the lessons learned and following&#13;
consultations with FAO, the government took early action to ensure that the country was&#13;
ready to address any possible invasion and suppress it before it could develop. It&#13;
established a National Food Security and Disaster Relief Committee chaired by Her&#13;
Excellency, the Vice President, to coordinate government action and mobilize resources.&#13;
The committee (i)conducted assessment surveys to determine presence o f DL; (ii)&#13;
conducted sensitization and training for farmers and other stakeholders (press&#13;
conferences, informationhnstruction bulletins to the farming communities and the general&#13;
public for the sighting and reporting o f DL); (iii)established fifteen Locust Campaign&#13;
Teams and the general campaign structure (information centers, central technical&#13;
committee, divisional task forces, district and village farmer brigades; (iv) distributed&#13;
pesticides, equipment and protective gears to the locust control teams; and (v) held&#13;
consultative meetings with FAO, UNDP, EU, Ambassadors, NGOs, the public and&#13;
private sectors and submitted proposals to donors for assistances. The Gambia&#13;
Government also reviewed its Locust Control Strategy and adopted a detailed operational&#13;
program for Locust control and the restoration o f agricultural assets and productivity in&#13;
areas affected by locust invasion. This program was the Locust control Meeting, held in&#13;
July 2004 inDakar, Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
Support by Domestic and External Partners - It i s estimated that the cost o f Government&#13;
short term preparedness activities (until end-December 2004) described above will&#13;
amount to US$2,0555, 706.3. Total contributions received from domestic partners to&#13;
date amount in cash, fuel and pesticides at national level amounts to D6, 860, 500 . The&#13;
FA0 has provided US$ 160,000, the UnitedStates Government US$ 50,000 and UNDP&#13;
US$ 50,000. Government contribution i s estimated at 10% o f project cost in kind&#13;
contribution. Details of individual donations are shown at Annex 1. The projected&#13;
financial gap for supported short-term activities has been funded by a PPF granted by&#13;
IDA on 22 September2004. The PPF has also been used for the detailed preparation o f&#13;
Government's medium-term program presentedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
111.    BankStrategy&#13;
Bank assistancewill support Government's overall program. It will be provided under the&#13;
Bank's Emergency Procedures (OPBP 8.50). It will provide support to Government's&#13;
emergency Locust controlleradication operations, complementing the assistance provided&#13;
by other donors but its main focus will be on (i) rehabilitation o f destroyed assets and&#13;
                                                  the&#13;
productive capacities of affected populations; and (ii) the strengthening o f capacities for&#13;
surveillance, early warning systems and response mechanisms at national but also at&#13;
regional levels, for reducing the risk and potential social, economic and environmental&#13;
impact o f future infestations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
IV.     Project Description&#13;
Overall Objectives - The overall objective o f the project i s to prevent or the minimize&#13;
economic and social impact damage due to the current locust infestation, and to improve&#13;
the national capacity to predict and control future infestations and mitigate its impact on&#13;
the national economy and populations. The project is fully in line with The Gambia&#13;
poverty reduction strategy and rural developmental strategy. It i s also hlly in line with&#13;
NEPAD's Comprehensive African Agriculture Program (CAADP) which emphasizes&#13;
better disaster preventiodmitigation and risk management as one on the main instruments&#13;
for growth andpoverty alleviation.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components&#13;
The project will have the following four components:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Component A - Emergency Locust Control - This component will support&#13;
       government activities increasing the national capacity for:&#13;
&#13;
                Tracking locust infestation, including inneighboring countries;&#13;
&#13;
                Increasing quick response capacity for effective control operations if an&#13;
                infestation does happen, as it aprks likely, in the coming months:&#13;
                awarenesshnformation campaigns, training o f farming communities,&#13;
                transport and other equipment for locust detection and control brigades,&#13;
                emergency stocks o f pesticides, protection gear; telecommunication&#13;
                equipment, andrelated operating costs;&#13;
&#13;
                Carrying out immediate actual field control/eradication operations should&#13;
                an outbreak materialize inearly 2005 ;&#13;
&#13;
                Improving the management o f pesticides through: a detailed inventory o f&#13;
                Locust control pesticides (to ensure that no banned chemicals re imported&#13;
                or used); the safe transport, packaging, storage and destruction o f Locust&#13;
                control   pesticides,   in accordance      with international      standards&#13;
                (International Code o f Conduct).&#13;
&#13;
    2. Component B - Restoration o f Populations Productive Capacities - This&#13;
       component will provide assistance to potentially affected populations through:&#13;
&#13;
       (i)      The distribution o f ((starter packs)) o f inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools,&#13;
                animal feed, etc.) to maintaidrestore the productive capacities o f the&#13;
                affected farmers andherders; and&#13;
&#13;
       (ii)     The undertaking o f cash for work program or collective productive micro-&#13;
                projects (dams, irrigatioddrainage, bottomland development), to provide&#13;
                alternative sources o f employment and revenues until the normal income&#13;
                streams are restored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             151&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     3. Component C - Strengthening o f National Capacities - This component will&#13;
         support the strengthening o f national capacities, and o f the regional capacities for&#13;
         undertaking collective action,         for surveillance/early warning, control and&#13;
         mitigation of locust (and other pests) infestations. Specifically, it will support:&#13;
&#13;
                 The sensitization and training o f farming communities/groups                  to&#13;
                 locust/pest detection and control;&#13;
&#13;
                 The complementary equipment o f the national pest management services&#13;
                 (constructionhehabilitation o f facilities, specialized equipment) and the&#13;
                 training, o f its staff;&#13;
&#13;
                 The implementation o f a strengthened research program on Locust&#13;
                 biological control and IPM, inparticular through participation into a joint&#13;
                 regional research program under C O W ;&#13;
&#13;
                 Short-term technical assistance and studies to: develop a comprehensive&#13;
                 national natural risk managementhlnerability reduction strategy to be&#13;
                 integrated into The Gambia's overall PRSP and rural development&#13;
                 strategy;     and      strengthen the      close    integration    o f   national&#13;
                 programdactivities into the regional framework for locust and other pest&#13;
                 management systems&#13;
&#13;
     4. Component D - Project Management and Coordination - The component will&#13;
         support the cost o f project management unit (office rehabilitation and equipment,&#13;
         short-term consultancies, incremental operating costs), including financial and&#13;
         technical audits, and participation in coordination meetings at the regional level.&#13;
         It will in particular finance the design, establishment and operations o f a&#13;
         comprehensive program monitoring and evaluation system (including economic,&#13;
         social and environmental impacts as well as cross boundaries issues) based on and&#13;
         fully integratedwith existing institutional andM$Esystems.&#13;
&#13;
IDA financing will represent 70 percent o f the total cost of government program. Other&#13;
funding will be provided by: Government; FAO; AfDB; EU; at about 30 percent The&#13;
program has beendesignedon an emergency basis, on the basis o f available information. It&#13;
i s therefore likelythat it will needto be adjusted to fit the actual evolution o fthe situation on&#13;
the ground. Its estimated cost includes important physical contingencies. Readjustments in&#13;
the program's emphasis and detailed content, and reallocations o f funds between&#13;
components, will be done every year/as necessary in close cooperation with all funding&#13;
partners, on the basis of actual needs and developments on the ground (as tracked by the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system that will be established from the start o f the program).&#13;
Un-necessaryhused funds from the IDAcredit will be cancelled at the endo fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
Project Implementation - The Department o f State for Agriculture will be responsible for&#13;
project implementation. The project is o f a multi-sectoral nature and it will be&#13;
implemented under the guidance o f the National Food Security and Disaster Relief&#13;
Committee which includes representatives from all related sectors health, environment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 152&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agriculture, NGOs, CBOs, and farmer organizations and the civil society. A Project&#13;
Coordinator will be appointed within the Department o f Plant Protection to manage and&#13;
coordinate the activities o f the Project. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for (i)&#13;
preparing detailed implementation plans and budgets, (ii)        supervising implementation&#13;
activities; and (iii)and reporting on the use o f resources and results achieved. The&#13;
financial management and procurement activities will be managed by the Capacity&#13;
Building Economic Management Project (CBEMP) which is already established and&#13;
operating according to procedures satisfactory to IDA. The PC will be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the support o f all external donors, ensuring coherence and transparence in&#13;
the use o f all available resources, and for timely and accurate reporting.&#13;
&#13;
It will be implemented through existing institutions and used for strengthening the&#13;
national institutional framework. Local communities/populations             will be closely&#13;
associated to the planning, implementation and monitoring o f its activities. For the&#13;
implementation of its activities, the project will collaborate with various national partners&#13;
(Department of Agricultural Services, National Agricultural Research Institute, National&#13;
Environment Agency, Department o f Planning, Department o f Health Services, The&#13;
Gambia College, Non Governmental Organizations and the Department o f Cooperatives)&#13;
as well as with institutions in other countries and relevant regional institutions for&#13;
collective actions concerningregional public goodshads. This i s inparticular the case for&#13;
the proposedresearch program which involves adoption o f alternatives to agro-pesticides&#13;
and other agricultural best practices inthe sub-region. (elaborate)&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement     - All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. Government o f The Gambia&#13;
will finance 100 percent of: (i) and duties (estimated at a rate o f 30 percent). The&#13;
                                   taxes&#13;
disbursement schedule i s expected to be as follows: about 90 percent o f the IDA Credit i s&#13;
expected to be disbursed during IDA fiscal year 2005; 4 percent during fiscal year 2006,&#13;
3 percent during fiscal year 2007 and 3 percent during fiscal year 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Special Account - The project will have only one special account. This special account,&#13;
which should be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, will be operated in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from IDA will be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures (transaction based disbursements). To expedite implementation, IDA will&#13;
make an advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the Credit by depositing it into a&#13;
Borrower-operated special account. The advance to the special account will be used to&#13;
finance IDA's share o f expenditures under the proposed Credit. Another acceptable&#13;
method o f withdrawing funds from the Credit i s the direct payment method, involving&#13;
direct payments from the Credit to a third party for works, goods and services upon the&#13;
Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial bank for expenditures&#13;
against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit. IDA's&#13;
Disbursement Letter stipulates a minimum application value for direct payment and&#13;
special commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               153&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, upon&#13;
credit effectiveness, the PMUwill be required to submit a withdrawal application for an&#13;
initial deposit to the Special Account, drawn from the IDA Credit, in an amount not to&#13;
exceed US$200,000 covering an estimated four months o f eligible o f expenditures&#13;
financed by IDA. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the special account will be made&#13;
upon evidence o f satisfactory utilization o f the advance, reflected in SOEs (Statement o f&#13;
Expenditures) and/or on full documentation for payments above SOE thresholds. The&#13;
special account will be used for all payments below twenty percent of the authorized&#13;
allocation and replenishment applications will be required to be submitted on a monthly&#13;
basis. If ineligible expenditures are found to have been made from the special account,&#13;
the Borrower will be obligated to refund the amounts withdrawn. If the special account&#13;
remains inactive for more than six months, IDA may request the Borrower to refundthe&#13;
amounts advanced to the special account.&#13;
&#13;
IDA will have the right, as reflected inthe Development Credit Agreement, to suspend&#13;
disbursement o f the funds, ifreporting requirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
Use of statements of expenditure - All application for the withdrawal o f proceeds from&#13;
the credit will be fully documented except for (a) contracts with an estimated value o f&#13;
less than US$500,000 for works; (b) contracts with an estimated value o f less than&#13;
US$250,000 for equipment and goods; (c) contracts with an estimated value o f less than&#13;
US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms and less thanUS$50,000 for individual consultants; and&#13;
(e) training, Micro-Grants and incremental operating expenses which may be claimed on&#13;
the basis o f SOEs. Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will&#13;
be retainedby PMU, and will be available for review when requested by IDA supervision&#13;
missions and auditors. All disbursements are subject to the condition of the Development&#13;
Credit Agreement andthe procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
All application for the withdrawal o f proceeds from the credit will be fully documented&#13;
for expenditures for Pesticide, regardless o fthe amount.&#13;
Whenproject implementationbegins, the quarterlyFinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs)&#13;
produced by the project will be reviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial&#13;
management capacity will enable PMU to establish effective financial management and&#13;
accounting systems, which should facilitate to produce the Financial Monitoring Report&#13;
(FMR).Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and a borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertaken by the&#13;
Task Team Leader (TTL), to determine if the project is eligible. The adoption o f report-&#13;
based disbursements by the project will enable it to move away from time consuming&#13;
voucher by voucher.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement Conditions - No withdrawals shall be made in respect of: (a) payments&#13;
made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) payments made under&#13;
category (3),(i) unless the Borrower has furnished to the Association a Pest Management&#13;
Plan in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, and (ii) the purchase of&#13;
                                                                         for&#13;
pesticides not included in the Authorized Pesticides List; and (c) payments made under&#13;
category (6), unless Micro-Grants have been made in accordance with the provisions set&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             154&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
forth or referred to inthe Project Implementation Planandthe provisions o fparagraph 13 o f&#13;
Schedule 4 of the Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
Project account - This account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly in this account in accordance with project&#13;
needs.    To facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, upon project effectiveness, the government would be required to make a deposit&#13;
into the project account of CFAF30,000,000 covering an estimated six months o f eligible&#13;
expenditures co-financed by the government.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementArrangements&#13;
Fiduciary aspects will be managed by the PIU o f the Capacity Building &amp; Economic&#13;
Management Project (CBEMP).&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
Procurement would be managed by the PIU o f the Capacity Building&amp; Economic Management&#13;
Project (CBEMP), which already have procurement specialist in its team with good experience&#13;
and qualification in procurement. To prevent heavy workloads during some implementation&#13;
phases, a short term consultant will be hired as needed.&#13;
&#13;
Documents related to procurement below the prior review thresholds will be maintained by the&#13;
Borrower for ex-post review by auditors and IDA supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
The PIU of the CBEMP will work closely with the Coordinator o f the Project located at the&#13;
Secretary o f State for Agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
Under project coordinator's supervision, the CBEMP will also be responsible for reporting on&#13;
Project   progress,     financial   management,   procurement   and   disbursement, identifying&#13;
implementation gaps and bottlenecks, and managingProject accounts andbudget.&#13;
&#13;
Procedures Manual - The financial and administrative manual in use by the CBEMP will be&#13;
adapted as needed inorder to respond to the specificity of the Locust Project.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementpackagepreparation - All procurement packages will&#13;
be prepared by the Procurement Specialist inthe PIU o f CBEMP.All procurementwill be carried&#13;
out inaccordance with the procurement plan and as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Assessment of theAgency's Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
The procurement capacity assessment o f the Procurement Specialist o f the CBEMP&#13;
shows a sufficient procurement capacity to handle the new project procurement in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank procedures, since he has been working with&#13;
procurement in IDA'S environment for three years and has attended trainings in&#13;
procurement. However, the support o f a short term consultant should be necessary in&#13;
order to reduce the heavy workload that could arise.&#13;

            Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania,

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the technical annex to the
            memorandum seeking approval to extend an Emergency Recovery
            Credit (ERC) to Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger,
            Senegal, and The Gambia. The Africa Emergency Locust Project
            (AELP) will provide emergency assistance to seven countries
            to deal with the current infestation of desert locusts and
            its impact on the livelihood of millions of rural people
            living within those countries. In the short-term, the
            project will finance goods and operating costs for emergency
            locust control efforts. During this same period it will also
            finance income-generating activities as well as agriculture
            and livestock investments for those communities that have
            lost their assets as a result of the infestation. In the
            medium-term, the project will strengthen the capacity of
            government crop protection agencies to manage a possible
            resurgence of the infestation in the period from 2005
            through 2007. Finally, the project will also support the
            countries ' participation in international
            collaborative efforts to prevent a re-occurrence of this
            natural disaster. The four project components address
            emergency locust management including launching a campaign
            and detailing inventories of pesticides; emergency
            agriculture investments including starter packs and animal
            feed to rural populations, and job creation, early warning
            and response consisting of building the capacity of crop
            protection agencies, financing equipment and software, and
            mobilizing village brigades; and project management.
