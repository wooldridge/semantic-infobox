The project did not directly address the issue of Pune's 700,000 slum dwellers who would have received only a marginal&#13;
share of the total project investments. However, the network was designed to reach the entrance of every slum to ensure&#13;
speedy access for the inhabitants when funds become available. It was envisaged that responsibility for individual connec-&#13;
tions would then rest with the municipality, not the private operator. But the project was an integral part of the long-term&#13;
urbain-infrastructure plan, designed to enhance the image of Pune as a forward-looking city, able to attroct national and&#13;
international investment with the certainty of a reliable, good quality, uninterrupted water supply. Such investments would&#13;
have had a positive impact on the economic fortunes of the area with knock-on effects for increased employment opportu-&#13;
nities and access to better standards of living for those in the poorer peri-urban villages.&#13;

            The cancellation of the Pune Water Supply
            and Sewerage Project - challenges in private sector participation
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 1998, the Pune Municipal Corporation
            attempted to implement an urban environmental infrastructure
            project, valued at approximately U$S 185 million. Though
            construction, and management contracts with a private sector
            firm. The project was an integral part of a 25-year
            strategic plan, which aimed to gradually extend, to the
            total population, a 24-hour water supply, and sewerage
            service. This groundbreaking partnership was also designed
            to ensure that Pune remained an attractive economic
            destination for investors. Had it succeeded, it would have
            provided a model for other cities in India seeking to
            improve services through private sector partnerships. The
            project was canceled for a number of reasons, but the most
            critical was a loss of political support. This case study
            seeks to analyze the challenges faced in the preparation of
            the project, many of which are illustrative of the obstacles
            to water sector reform, including increased private sector
            participation, in South Asia.
