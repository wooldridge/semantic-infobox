&amp;#12;&#13;
                    Box 2: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
&#13;
                    (i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories&#13;
                         of member countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the&#13;
                         project is located must be guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or&#13;
                         its central bank or a comparable agency of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the&#13;
                         member itself has been obtained in all such cases to date.&#13;
&#13;
                    (ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member&#13;
                         countries. Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, eco-&#13;
                         nomic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness.&#13;
&#13;
                    (iii)In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Deci-&#13;
                         sions to make loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's&#13;
                         economic structure, including assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
                         exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
&#13;
                    (iv)IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's&#13;
                         overall external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under&#13;
                         conditions which, in the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. IBRD is intended to pro-&#13;
                         mote private investment, not to compete with it.&#13;
&#13;
                    (v)The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are&#13;
                         used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-&#13;
                         effectiveness. This policy is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation&#13;
                         establishing, to IBRD's satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are&#13;
                         made in conformity with the applicable lending agreements and (b) to maximize competition in the&#13;
                         procurement of goods and services by using, wherever possible, international competitive bidding&#13;
                         or, when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum economy and efficiency.&#13;

    a.   Includes loans issued prior to 1980, and loans to IFC, in addition to multicurrency pool loans.&#13;
&#13;
    b.   Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The present target&#13;
         ratio is one U.S. dollar for every 125 Japanese yen and one euro. These three major currencies comprise at least 90% of the multicurrency&#13;
         loans' U.S. dollar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the&#13;
         selection of currencies for disbursements on those loans and by the currencies selected for the billing of the principal repayments. Along with&#13;
         the selection of disbursement currencies, IBRD manages the selection of repayment currencies to maintain the alignment of the multicur-&#13;
         rency loans' composition with the target ratio. The selection of currencies for repayment billing by IBRD precludes the determination of aver-&#13;
         age maturity information for multicurrency loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periods for its&#13;
         multicurrency loans on a combined U.S. dollars equivalent basis.&#13;

a. World Bank Atlas methodology; per capita GNI (gross national income, formerly GNP) figures are in 2002 U.S. dollars.&#13;
b. Countries are eligible for IDA on the basis of (a) relative poverty and (b) lack of creditworthiness. The operational cutoff for IDA eligibility for&#13;
FY04 is a 2002 GNI per capita of US$865, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries must also meet tests of performance. In&#13;
exceptional circumstances, IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjust-&#13;
ment efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD lending. An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote c).&#13;
c. An exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($865 for FY04) has been made for some small island economies, which&#13;
otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries, IDA funding is considered&#13;
case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness.&#13;

    Note: Countries eligible to borrow from IBRD and IDA are listed in Appendix 2. For consistency of comparison, the Republic of Korea and Serbia&#13;
     and Montenegro (former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) are included as countries eligible to borrow for all periods covered by this table. The&#13;
     Republic of Korea, a former graduate, again became eligible to borrow in December 1997. Serbia and Montenegro's eligibility was reestablished in&#13;
     May 2001. Amounts may not add to totals because of rounding.&#13;
     a. Amounts exclude disbursements for debt-reduction and net advance disbursements. Amounts also exclude disbursements for structural and&#13;
     sectoral adjustment loans, hybrids (loans that support policy and institutional reforms in a specific sector by financing both a policy component&#13;
     disbursed against imports and investment component), and disbursements under HIPC Initiative grants.&#13;
     b. Percentages are based on the dollar amounts shown under the total disbursements section. These percentages show both the breakdown between&#13;
     countries eligible to borrow from the IBRD or IDA, or both, and countries not eligible to borrow, for individual goods categories and the share of&#13;
     each goods category compared with total disbursements.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Annual Report for 2003,
            reviews the strategy and action pursued by the Bank, based
            on the Strategic Framework, and Strategic Directions (and
            Management Action Plan), focused on meeting the development
            challenges embodied in the Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs). To this end, the Bank sharpened its policies,
            programs, and instruments to support its central mission of
            reducing poverty, through improved performance monitoring,
            and management, and improved harmonization of operational
            policies, procedures, and practices among donors. The Bank
            also considered other issues, such as its role in the
            reconstruction of Iraq, the introduction of the grants
            component in the 13th Replenishment of the International
            Development Association (IDA), the Operation Evaluation
            Department's (OED) review of the Heavily Indebted Poor
            Countries (HIPC) Initiative, and, market access for exports
            from developing countries. Methods for combating terrorism,
            and money laundering were also considered during the period
            under review. The document presents thematic (and regional)
            perspectives based on two pillars - poverty reduction and
            economic management - and how to invest in people, towards
            an environmentally, and socially responsible growth, that
            supports private sector development, infrastructure
            development, financial management, and, promotes appropriate
            legal and judicial systems. The second Volume presents the
            financial statements for the period July 1, 2002 to June 30,
            2003, reporting development activities (loans, guarantees,
            and other activities), including liquidity management,
            funding resources, and financial risk management.
