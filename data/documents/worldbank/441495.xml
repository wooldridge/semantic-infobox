        <abstracts>
            From the early 1950s until quite
            recently, the Japanese government took an active role in
            promoting a bank debenture market. This Note explains how
            the Japanese bank debenture market developed and what role
            these debentures played in establishing a bond market. The
            debenture market started life at a time when massive amounts
            of long-term capital were needed for reconstruction. Capital
            markets had not yet developed, and market-base long-term
            funding was seen as too risky by both investors and
            financial institutions.
