Abstract&#13;
This paper examines the role that education and training have played&#13;
in Japan's transformation from a preindustrial agrarian society in the&#13;
late 19th century to one of the leading industrial nations some 100 years&#13;
later. It provides as well some lessons for developing countries.&#13;
The first part of the paper discusses the establishment by the&#13;
Meiji government (1868-1912) of a new school system to train the manpower&#13;
needed to create a modern Japan. The Meiji government concentrated first&#13;
on developing higher education to provide the leaders required for Japan's&#13;
process of modernization. Expatriates played an, important role in the&#13;
development of the higher education subsector. The government also&#13;
recognized the need to provide universal primary education and was able&#13;
to achieve this by the end of the Meiji period. Much of the financial&#13;
burden of primary education was transferred from the central government&#13;
to local governments, which were also given a high degree of autonomy.&#13;
The emphasis on higher and primary education resulted in severe shortages&#13;
of skilled middle-level manpower needed for industrialization. To&#13;
address this problem, the government issued the Ordinance on Industrial&#13;
Schools in 1899, which sought to develop industrial education and training&#13;
at the secondary level.&#13;
The development of the education system during the Meiji period&#13;
was essentially a process of trial and error. After the Second World War,&#13;
Japan developed a new educational system comprising six years of primary&#13;
education, three years of lower and three years of upper secondary school,&#13;
and four years of university. The system has developed rapidly: enrollment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rates at the primary and lower secondary level are at present almost&#13;
100 percent and at the upper secondary level, 94 percent. Education plays a&#13;
large role in Japanese society, which has been described as an "academic&#13;
qualification society." Academic qualifications determine an individual's&#13;
salary, promotion, and social status, and therefore competition for places&#13;
in the top schools is fierce. There is an overall bias toward general&#13;
education rather than learning specific skills. The reason for this is&#13;
that in a time of rapid technological change a strong background of&#13;
general knowledge is more useful than specific vocational skills that may&#13;
soon become obsolete.&#13;
The role of companies in the upgrading and utilization of manpower&#13;
is considered in the second part of the paper. The government gives&#13;
strong support to the education and training system in Japanese companies&#13;
through financial assistance and incentives. The system covers almost&#13;
all levels of employees in a company. Moreover, under the Japanese life-&#13;
time employment system, employees receive education and training at each&#13;
stage of their career until they retire. Japanese workers are also&#13;
encouraged to play an active role in their companies; the idea of quality&#13;
control circles has contributed to higher levels of quality and greater&#13;
participation by employees. Aspects of the Japanese style of management are&#13;
considered, including the lifetime employment system that results in low&#13;
levels of unemployment and relatively stable labor-management relations.&#13;
In its summary, the paper considers several aspects of Japan's&#13;
development experience and suggests lessons that developing countries&#13;
could draw from this experience.&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
The three basic resources necessary for economic development are&#13;
financial resources (money), physical resources (material) and human resources&#13;
(manpower). Although all three are closely related and mutually dependent in&#13;
the process of economic development, manpower appears to be the most funda-&#13;
mental resource. A country with rich natural resources and ample financial&#13;
resources cannot necessarily achieve steady economic development if it does&#13;
not have enough manpower to utilize and develop them. On the other hand, a&#13;
country with well educated manpower has a chance to obtain economic success,&#13;
even if it has poor natural resources.&#13;
Human resources have played a crucial role in Japan's economic&#13;
development. The Government has always been strongly concerned about the&#13;
nation's education, and by the end of the Meiji period Japan had achieved&#13;
almost universal compulsory education. Today, the rate of attendance at upper&#13;
secondary schools is 94% and that at university 32%. In regard to skill&#13;
acquisition, various types of institutions such as upper secondary schools&#13;
offering vocational courses, technical colleges, special training schools,&#13;
vocational training schools and junior vocational training colleges are&#13;
provided. However, people seem to prefer general education to vocational.&#13;
This is because the Japanese educational system works as a sophisticated&#13;
mechanism to select students, and companies recruit new graduates based on&#13;
their academic qualification rather than their vocational knowledge and&#13;
skills.&#13;
After hiring new graduates, Japanese companies provide long and&#13;
systematic education and training for all employees including blue-collar&#13;
workers in order to develop their potential capability, although there are&#13;
some differences between large companies and small and medium companies. These&#13;
long and systematic education and training programs are based on the so-called&#13;
Japanese style of management such as life-time employment and seniority wage&#13;
system. Another remarkable characteristic of Japanese manpower is workers'&#13;
participation in management and production. Human oriented activities such as&#13;
quality control (QC) circles play an important role in Japanese economic&#13;
development.&#13;
The main purpose of this paper is to examine the formation and&#13;
utilization of manpower for economic development in Japan, and to consider&#13;
some lessons for developing countries from Japan's experience. The paper&#13;
consists of two main chapters. Chapter II considers the role of schools and&#13;
training institutes in the formation of manpower and examines the education&#13;
and training system both in the Meiji period and in the post-World War II&#13;
period. Chapter III deals with the role of companies in the upgrading and&#13;
utilization of manpower. Education and training in a company, Japanese&#13;
management and manpower, and workers' participation are the main topics of&#13;
this chapter. The final chapter describes the lessons which developing&#13;
countries can learn from Japan's experience.&#13;

CHAPTER II&#13;
THE ROLE OF SCHOOLS AND TRAINING INSTITUTES&#13;
IN THE FORMATION OF MANPOWER&#13;
1. The Acquisition of Skills for Industrialization in the Meiji Period&#13;
This section examines the Japanese education and training system,&#13;
especially as regards the acquisition of skills for industrialization in the&#13;
Meiji period. During this time Japan started her modernization process and&#13;
transformed herself from a pre-industrial agrarian society to a modern&#13;
industrial nation.&#13;
The Meiji period was a time of trial and error for modernization.&#13;
In the field of education and training, too, many kinds of schools and&#13;
training institutes were established based on different policies. However,&#13;
roughly speaking, we can distinguish three types of education and training&#13;
systems in this period, namely: (a) higher level specialized education and&#13;
training for the selected elite; (b) primary level general education for&#13;
everybody; and (c) secondary level industrial education and training for those&#13;
not included in the elite category. In the following section, we will examine&#13;
the development of these three systems in this order.&#13;
(a) Higher level specialized education and training&#13;
The first concern of the Meiji Government was for higher education&#13;
rather than primary or secondary education. One of the characteristics of the&#13;
Government's educational policies was that, in producing manpower for&#13;
industrialization, they started with top level engineers, and only later&#13;
focussed on middle and lower level engineers. This was mainly because the&#13;
Meiji Government tried to quickly foster limited elites to be leaders of&#13;
Japan's modernization. It should also be noted that, in the early Meiji&#13;
period, each ministry had its owy, school or training institute to produce the&#13;
necessary manpower in its field_      In 1878, for example, there were the&#13;
following schools for higher education and training under the management of&#13;
different ministries.&#13;
Ministry of Education       -   University of Tokyo&#13;
Ministry of Engineering     -   College of Engineering&#13;
Ministry of Home Affairs    -   Komaba Agricultural School&#13;
Ministry of Justice         -   School of Law&#13;
Board of Cultivation        -   Sappro Agricultural School&#13;
KOBU DAIGAKKO (Ministry's College of Engineering) played the most&#13;
important role in producing high level skilled manpower.    The 2/ollege was&#13;
established by a young British engineer, Henry Dyer, in 1873.,      When he&#13;
planned the College, he did not directly transfer the European model to Japan&#13;
but built his own unique system of engineering education, which combined&#13;
theoretical study in a school and practical training in a factory. He divided&#13;
a six-year course into three terms. In the first two years, students learned&#13;
basic theory in a school, in the next two years they took both specialized&#13;
subjects in a school and on-the-job training in the ministry's factories, and&#13;
in the final two years they concentrated on on-the-job training. The College&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
was highly successful anl the level of education was outstanding even by world&#13;
standards at that time.3    Graduates from the College had to work in the&#13;
Ministry of Engineering for seven years and piayed a crucial role in Japanese&#13;
industrialization and technological deveLopment. After producing 211&#13;
graduates, the College was absorbed into Tokyo University and became the&#13;
Department of Engineering in 1886. The jurisdiction of most of the other&#13;
ministries' schools was also gradually transferred to the Ministry of&#13;
Education.&#13;
It is important to pay attention to the role of the thousands of&#13;
foreign experts and teachers,such as Dyer, who were employed by the Meiji&#13;
Government. For example, the Ministry of Engineering employed 588 foreign&#13;
experts until it was abolished in 1X05, and all staff in the College of&#13;
Engineering were British educators.-    The cost of employing them, however,&#13;
was very high. The Meiji Government spent 4% of the total budget for salary&#13;
payments to them in the period from 1868 to 1872, 2% from 1873 to 1877, and 1%&#13;
from 1878 to 1882.   In the case gf the Ministry of Engineering the payment&#13;
reached 58% of the total budget._&#13;
Another important education and training institute for industrial-&#13;
ization was TOKYO SHOKKO GAKKO (Tokyo Craftsmen's School, the present Tokyo&#13;
Institute of Technology), which was established in 1881. The original purpose&#13;
of the school was to produce middle-level skilled manpower such as chief&#13;
craftsmen or instructors for other craftsmen's schools by giving vocational&#13;
training to poor students. The school had a four year course; one year for&#13;
basic subjects and three years for specialized subjects. However, since most&#13;
of the common people did not understand why craftsmen should go to school,&#13;
more than 70% of the students came from the samurai class and became the same&#13;
type of industrial elite as the graduates from the College of Engineering.&#13;
Although the development of Japanese industry required a great&#13;
number of skilled workers, graduates from the Ministry's College of Engineer-&#13;
ing and the Tokyo Craftsmen's School were limited, and they became managers or&#13;
administrators of industries rather than workers. As a result, a shortage of&#13;
middle-level skilled manpower emerged as a serious problem for Japanese&#13;
industrialization in the 1890s.&#13;
Before looking at this problem, we will first examine the primary&#13;
education system.&#13;
(b) Primary level general education&#13;
Although primary education is not directly related to occupation or&#13;
skill acquisition, it played a crucial role in Japanese development in the&#13;
following two senses. First, it realized almost universal literacy and&#13;
numeracy by the end of the Meiji period. Second, in primary school pupils&#13;
learned the attitude and ethics necessary to be modern workers. In short,&#13;
primary education provided the basis of modern manpower for Japanese&#13;
industrialization.&#13;
A Ministry of Education was organized in 1871 to make a nationwide&#13;
plan of education, and GAKUSEI (The Fundamental Code of Education, or&#13;
literally "School System") was regulated the following year. The Code was the&#13;
first national plan for a universal education system in Japan. Diagram II-1&#13;
shows the school system regulated by the Code. According to the Code, the&#13;

entire country was divided into eight university blocks, each university block&#13;
into 32 secondary school blocks, and each secondary school block into 210&#13;
primary school blocks. In this way a total of eight universities, 256&#13;
secondary schools and 53,760 primary schools were to be built. Howev r, this&#13;
was only a desk plan and most of the schools did not actually exist.67 The&#13;
main purpose of the Code was to provide a universal primary school system, and&#13;
to encourage people nationwide to learn in school. The famous preamble of the&#13;
Code states:&#13;
It is only by building up his character, developing his mind, and&#13;
cultivating his talents that man may make his way in the world, employ&#13;
his wealth wisely, make his business prosper, and thus attain the goal of&#13;
life. But man cannot build up his character, develop his mind, or&#13;
cultivate his talents without education - that is the reason for the&#13;
establishment of schools...Learning is the key to success in life, and no&#13;
man can afford to neglect it....Learning has been viewed as the exclusive&#13;
privilege of the samurai and his superiors, farmers, artisans, merchants,&#13;
and women have neglected it altogether and do not even know its&#13;
meaning...This was due to our evil traditions and, in turn, checked the&#13;
spread of culture, hampered the development of talent and accomplish-&#13;
ments, and sowed the seeds of poverty, bankruptcy, and disrupted homes.&#13;
Every man should therefore pursue learning; and in so doing he should not&#13;
misconstrue its purpose. Accordingly, the Department of Education will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
soon establish an educational system and will revise the regulations&#13;
relating thereto from time to time; wherefore there shall, in the future,&#13;
be no community with an illiterate family, nor a family with an&#13;
illiterate member. Every guardian, acting in accordance with this, shall&#13;
bring up h's children with tender care, never failing to have them attend&#13;
school...-&#13;
From this preamble we can observe three basic ideas of the Meiji&#13;
Government about primary education. First, the Government grasped the meaning&#13;
of education from a practical and utilitarian point of view. They repeated to&#13;
people that learning is the key to success in life. This is because the&#13;
Government believed that learning was also the key to economic success in&#13;
Japan. Learning, here, means acquiring western knowledge and skills for&#13;
modernization, and primary education was regarded as a basic tool to achieve&#13;
this purpose. Second, the Code is based on an egalitarian idea of&#13;
education. It is remarkable that immediately after feudalism Japan had an&#13;
egalitarian educational system, in which the former so-called four different&#13;
social classes (samurai, frmers, artisans, and merchants) attended the same&#13;
class in the same school.8    Third, the Code started the first compulsory&#13;
education in Japan. The Code tried to spread primary education by means of&#13;
regulating several kinds of primary school such as girls school, village&#13;
school, poor people's school, etc. as well as ordinary primary school, which&#13;
had four years lower course and four years upper course. Table II-1 shows the&#13;
rates of attendance at primary school in the Meiji period. Even compared with&#13;
western countries at that time, 35% in 1875 was a high rate. At the end of&#13;
the Meiji period it was close to 100%.&#13;

The biggest obstacle to the implementation of the Code was&#13;
finance.  A great part of the national budget for education had to be spent&#13;
for Tokyo University and sending students abroad. In the first budget of&#13;
1873, for example, Y 100,000 out of Y 800,000 was earmarked for overseas&#13;
study.  Y 300,000 was spent in 1873 for 1,260,0009pupils in 14,000 primary&#13;
schools, but this subsidy was abolished in 1881._'   Table II-2 shows the&#13;
comparison of expenditure between Tokyo University and primary education.&#13;

Because the national budget could not afford the necessary expenditure for&#13;
nationwide primary education, local governments and people had to provide most&#13;
of it. Table II-3 shows the national and local share of educational expend-&#13;
iture. As shown in the table, almost 90% of public expenditure for education&#13;
was provided by local governments in the Meiji period. As Passin commented,&#13;
"this undoubtedly had many advantages: It assumed a closer correspondence&#13;
between public demand and availability of school facilities than otherwise&#13;
would have prevailed; and it corresponded with her administrative traditiong&#13;
and with the new administrative structure developed by the modern regime." -2&#13;

(c) Secondary level industrial education and training&#13;
As presented in the previous sections, the Meiji Government began to&#13;
establish an education and training system first at the higher specialized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
level and then at the primary general level. Although a secondary school&#13;
system had also been provided, it was only for a limited elite who were going&#13;
to higher school, and curriculum in the school was mainly for general rather&#13;
than vocational education. Therefore, as the Japanese economy developed,&#13;
industrial education and training to produce middle level skilled manpower was&#13;
recognized as vital for Japanese industrialization. In the early 1890s, just&#13;
before the Japanese industrial revolution, the Meiji Government institution-&#13;
alized two types of secondary level vocational schools, that is, JITSUGYO&#13;
HOSYU GAKKO (Industrial Supplementary Schools) and TOTEI GAKKO (Apprentice&#13;
Schools), and enacted the National Treasury Subsidy Law for Vocational&#13;
Education Expenses to give financial support to these schools.&#13;
The industrial supplementary schools, which were institutionalized&#13;
in 1893, were defined as "places where necessary knowledge and skills are&#13;
taught as a supplement to primary school education to pupils who will work in&#13;
various industries" (Regulation of the School, Article 1). The schools&#13;
accepted mainly primary school leavers and gave them industrial education and&#13;
training for three years. Subjects included a moral course, reading, writing,&#13;
arithmetic and other subjects related to their occupation. The schools aimed&#13;
at producing semiskilled manpower for various industries. As shown in Table&#13;
II-4, the number of schools steadily increased until they were converted into&#13;
youth schools in 1935.&#13;
The apprentice schools, which were institutionalized in 1894, were&#13;
defined as "places where necessary subjects for craftsmen are taught"&#13;
(Regulation of the School, Article 1). The schools aimed at giving systematic&#13;
vocational education and training in a school, instead of apprenticeship in a&#13;
factory. The schools, however, failed to develop as training institutes and&#13;
were abolished in 1920. Kimura mentioned three reasons why the schools&#13;
failed. First, 144 schools out of a total of 238 apprentice schools were&#13;
women's schools, and their programs contained little technical education for&#13;
industrialization. Second, most of the schools which tried to modernize&#13;
traditional local industry failed to attract students, who were interested in&#13;
modern technical engineering. Third, although the schools were expected to&#13;
combine theory and practic   qf industrial education and training, this task&#13;
proved too heavy for them.-&#13;

The Ordinance of Industrial Schools, which is one of the most&#13;
important laws on industrial education and training in the Meiji period, was&#13;
enacted in 1899.    The purpose of the Ordinance was to develop industrial&#13;
education and training at the secondary level in order to meet the demand for&#13;
middle level skilled workers as a result of the Japanese industrial revolution&#13;
after the Sino - Japan War (1894-1895). The Ordinance classified five basic&#13;
industrial schools, that is, Engineering School, Agricultural School,&#13;
Commercial School, Mercantile Marine School, and Industrial Supplementary&#13;
School. The Apprentice School was regarded as a kind of Engineering School.&#13;
Table II-5 shows the development of industrial schools, excluding the&#13;
industrial supplementary schools.&#13;

2. System for Acquiring Skills for High Economic Growth&#13;
in the Post-War Period&#13;
Japan's rapid reconstruction after the Second World War and&#13;
subsequent high rate of economic growth are often regarded as a "miracle".&#13;
Japan's average growth rate of GDP was 10.4% between 1960 and 1970, and 4.6%&#13;
between 1970 and 1982, these figures are the highest among the advanced&#13;
industrial market economies. Japan's share of GNP in the world, except the&#13;
USSR, has increased from only 2.9% ($44 billion 12n 1960 to 11.1% ($1.1 tril-&#13;
lion) in 1980, which is second only to the USA.-     Education and training&#13;
have played an important role in this remarkable economic growth. The World&#13;
Development Report 1980, for example, says:&#13;
The outstanding growth of Japan ... probably could not have&#13;
been achieved without their distinctively early mass literacy&#13;
and numeracy, which (together with land reform, more advanced&#13;
education and good economic management) contributed to&#13;
increased agricultural productivity, to the expansion of&#13;
labor-intensive manufacturing and exports, and to their&#13;
remarkable ability to adapt to changes in technology and&#13;
world demand. (pp. 37, 39).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
The purpose of this section is to examine the kind of education and&#13;
training system, especially for the acquisition of skills, that has been&#13;
provided for this high economic growth. Although education and training in&#13;
contemporary Japan are conducted by thousands of schools and training&#13;
institutions, we will divide them into two categories: (a) the program&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Education; and (b) the program administered by&#13;
the Ministry of Labor. This is not a distinction between general education&#13;
and vocational training, since the former includes both general and vocational&#13;
education, while the latter is mainly concerned with vocational training.&#13;
(a) The program administered by the Ministry of Education&#13;
After the Second World War, Japan developed a completely new&#13;
educational system. Diagram II-2 shows the present school system administered&#13;
by the Ministry of Education, and Table II-6 shows the number of schools,&#13;
their students, and the rates of enrollment.&#13;

As shown in the diagram, at present Japan has a so-called 6-3-3-4&#13;
system (six years for primary school, three years for lower secondary school,&#13;
three years for upper secondary school, and four years for university). The&#13;
first nine years of education are compulsory. Upper secondary school is&#13;
divided into a general course and a vocational course. The 12 years of&#13;
general education in primary school, and lower and upper secondary school, and&#13;
the four years of higher level specialized education in university are&#13;
regarded as the "main stream" of education. With regard to vocational&#13;
education and training, however, other types of schools such as vocational&#13;
courses in upper secondary schools, technical colleges, special training&#13;
schools, and miscellaneous schools also play a very important role. In the&#13;
following section, we will briefly examine each of these schools from the&#13;
viewpoint of skill acquisition.&#13;
Primary and Lower Secondary Schools (SHOGAKKO and CHUGAKKO)&#13;
As mentioned above, at present Japan has nine years of compulsory&#13;
education at primary and lower secondary level, and enrollment rates are&#13;
almost 100%. Table II-7 shows the standard number of yearly teaching hours at&#13;
primary and lower secondary school. More than 60% of teaching hours are spent&#13;
on general subjects such as "Japanese language", "social studies",&#13;
"arithmetic" and "science" (and "English language" in lower secondary school).&#13;

In regard to education related to skill acquisition, "drawing and handicraft"&#13;
and "homemaking" in primary school, and "industrial arts and homemaking" in&#13;
lower secondary school should be mentioned, although they account for less&#13;
than 10% of all teaching hours. These subjects aim to give pupils basic&#13;
skills to enIji7e them to carry out planning, manufacturing, and maintenance&#13;
activities."&#13;
Upper Secondary Schools (KOTOCAKKO or KOKO)&#13;
Although upper secondary school is not compulsory, the rate of&#13;
enrollment has already reached 94% (Table II-6). The courses at upper&#13;
secondary schools are roughly classified into two groups: the general&#13;
education course and the vocational education course. In both of these&#13;
courses, the minimum credits required for graduation are 80, (one credit&#13;
consists of 35 unit hours in the course of one school year, one unit hour&#13;
being 50 minutes of teaching) and students in vocational courses must obtain&#13;
at least 30 credits in the relevant vocational sub . t areas such as&#13;
Agriculture, Fisheries, Engineering, and Commerce._ Table II-8 indicates&#13;
the number of courses and students at upper secondary schools.&#13;

As shown in this table, more than 70% of students in upper secondary&#13;
schools take general rather than vocational courses.   Since vocational course&#13;
school leavers do not always get occupations in the same industry as that&#13;
covered by the courses they have studied at school, most of the school leavers&#13;
start work without any vocational training. Table II-9, which indicates the&#13;
percentage of occupations of upper secondary leavers classified by their&#13;
courses in school, clarifies this point.&#13;

According to the results in Table II-10, only 30% of upper secondary leavers&#13;
state that their occupation is very or somehow related to the subjects they&#13;
studied in school. In the case of plant workers (Table II-9) trained school&#13;
leavers account for only 43% (13.5/31.6) of all leavers in this occupation.&#13;
In other words, when companies employ upper secondary school leavers as plant&#13;
workers, 57% of them are not trained for this occupation. In the case of&#13;
office workers, we get almost the same percentage. This implies that&#13;
vocational courses at upper secondary schools do not play a significant role&#13;
in producing skilled manpower, and that general course leavers are trained in&#13;
a company. We will examine the reasons for this in Chapter II-(3).&#13;

Technical Colleges (KOTO SENMON GAKKO or KOSEN)&#13;
Technical colleges were inaugurated in 1962 as unique higher&#13;
educational institutions for science and technology. As shown in Diagram II-&#13;
2, technical colleges are connected directly to lower secondary schools and&#13;
give five years continuous education and training. Therefore, in these&#13;
colleges, students can get higher education immediately after the completion&#13;
of compulsory education. Compared with the combined school hours of upper&#13;
secondary school (general course) and university for seven years, Table II-il,&#13;
technic Icolleges give less general education, but more specialized edu-&#13;
cation.-    Technical colleges are therefore more effective, in the sense of&#13;
the period of skill acquisition, than a combination of upper secondary school&#13;
and university.&#13;

Universities and Junior Colleges (DAICAKU and TANDAI)&#13;
Institutions of higher education in Japan comprise universities and&#13;
junior colleges, together with technical colleges and special training schools&#13;
(described later). The length of a university undergraduate course is four&#13;
years for most courses, and six years for medicine and dentistry. Junior&#13;
colleges, which have two or three year courses, aim at fostering such&#13;
practical abilities as are required for vocational or daily life. Table II-12&#13;
indicates the number of students classified by specialization at universities&#13;
(undergraduate), junior colleges (undergraduate) and graduate schools. As&#13;
shown in the table, there were about 2.2 million students at universities and&#13;
junior colleges in 1983. However, they do not necessarily acquire skills or&#13;
knowledge directly related to their future occupations. "Humanities" and&#13;
"Social Science" courses in particular have very little relation to students'&#13;
future occupations in Japan. With regard to skill acquisition, we should note&#13;
that the percentage of students in "Natural Science", "Engineering&#13;
(Industry)", "Agronomics (Agriculture)", "Medicine and Dentistry (Health)" and&#13;
"Pharmacy" courses is only 30.4%. Table II-13 shows this point more clearly.&#13;

We can see from this table that only 18.6% of graduates who majored&#13;
in natural science, engineering, agronomics, and health, became specialists.&#13;
The table also shows that 60% of graduates who find occupations work as office&#13;
workers, sales workers or other nonspecialists. We can assume that this 60%&#13;
of graduates start working with little or no vocational training for their&#13;
occupation. They get their training in a company as we will examine in the&#13;
next chapter.&#13;
Miscellaneous Schools and Special Training Schools (KAKUSHU GAKKO&#13;
and SENSHU GAKKO)&#13;
Miscellaneous schools have been traditionally neglected from the&#13;
mainstream of education. However, from the point of view of skill&#13;
acquisition, miscellaneou   7chools play important roles which other formal&#13;
"schools" cannot fulfill.16    First, miscellaneous schools offer a wide range&#13;
of opportunities for skill acquisition. As shown in Table II-6, there are&#13;
about 4,700 miscellaneous schools, offering various types of courses which&#13;
cover such areas as home economics, medical care, engineering, commerce, arts&#13;
and culture, etc. Second, they can quickly respond to the latest needs of&#13;
vocational training because most of them are privately run and of relatively&#13;
small size. For example, with the progress of technology in the 1960s, many&#13;
miscellaneous schools were newly established in the areas of electronics and&#13;
&#13;

computers. Third, many of the courses in miscellaneous schools are closely&#13;
linked with occupational qualifications and trade skill tests.&#13;
In 1976, the School Education Law formally recognized some of the&#13;
miscellaneous schools as "schools". These are special training schools. In&#13;
order to be a special training school, each miscellaneous school must enroll&#13;
40 or more students and the length of each course must be minimum one year,&#13;
with 800 or more teaching hours per year. Special training schools can be&#13;
classified into three types by their courses: upper secondary courses, (KOTO&#13;
SENSHU GAKKO) for the graduates from lower secondary schools, advanced or&#13;
college courses (SENMOM GAKKO) for the graduates from upper secondary school,&#13;
and general courses (SENSHU CAKKO) for other students. As shown in&#13;
Table II-14, in 1983, there were 2,860 special training schools with 512,180&#13;
students. Their role in producing middle level technicians is significant.&#13;

Expenditure&#13;
Lastly, let us briefly examine the educational expenditure for the&#13;
schools administered by the Ministry of Education. Table II-15 indicates&#13;
school expenditure classified by type of school. This includes all the&#13;
expenditures for education at national, public and private institutions. From&#13;
this table we can observe the following two points. First, the ratio of total&#13;
expenditure against national income has steadily increased from 5.6% in 1955&#13;
to 7.6% in 1978. Second, the share of the expenditure for compulsory&#13;
education has decreased from 64.0% in 1955 to 55.4% in 1978, and it has been&#13;
replaced by an increase in the rate of upper secondary school and higher&#13;
education. This is mainly because the rates of enrollment in upper secondary&#13;
school and higher education have rapidly increased, although that of&#13;
compulsory education had already reached 100%.&#13;

Table II-16 shows school expenditure in 1978 classified by&#13;
defrayer. The following points should be observed from this table. First,&#13;
more than 70% of total expenditure is accounted for by the local government&#13;
and private school, and the share of the national government is less than&#13;
30%. The national government pays for more than half of the expenditure for&#13;
higher education. Compared with expenditures in the Meiji period, the&#13;
situation appears similar. Second, more than 80% of upper secondary school&#13;
expenditure is accounted for by the local public entity. This means demand&#13;
for enrollment in upper secondary schools, where the rate of enrollment&#13;
reached 94%, has been met by local government financing. Third, it should be&#13;
noted that 96.6% of the expenditures for special training schools and miscell-&#13;
aneous schools are accounted for by private schools, and 81.4% of the expendi-&#13;
ture is paid back by the students. This implies that the cost of acquiring&#13;
skills in special training schools or miscellaneous schools is more expensive&#13;
than in other institutions such as vocational courses at upper secondary&#13;
schools.&#13;

(b) Program Administered by the Ministry of Labor&#13;
The main purpose of this section is to examine the present&#13;
vocational training system regulated by the Vocational Training Law. First of&#13;
all, it is useful to clarify some differences between the program administered&#13;
by the Ministry of Education, especially vocational courses in upper secondary&#13;
schools, technical colleges and special training schools, and that adminis-&#13;
tered by the Ministry of Labor.&#13;
First, vocational education and training in the Education Ministry's&#13;
schools is regarded as only part of the education which aims at the full&#13;
development of the students' personality (Fundamental Law of Education),&#13;
whereas the Labor Ministry's institutions aim at the development of the&#13;
workers' abilities necessary for their occupation (Vocational Training Law).&#13;
However, their subjects are not completely different, since both of them aim&#13;
at providing useful skills for students. The Vocational Training Law states&#13;
that vocational training must be practiced without duplication of school&#13;
education, but with close relation to it (Article 3). Therefore, we can say&#13;
that these two programs are different basically in their viewpoints.&#13;
Second, although the program administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Education has almost the same curriculum in any part of Japan, that of the&#13;
Ministry of Labor has various kinds of courses according to the needs of the&#13;
regions where the schools are located. The Ministry of Education's curriculum&#13;
includes more basic and general subjects than the Ministry of Labor's but the&#13;
latter has more flexibility in its subjects and can-more easily meet the&#13;
demands of the region and of industry.&#13;
Third, with regard to the duration of the course, the program&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Education is for at least one year (for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
example, 1-3 years in special training schools, 3 years in the vocational&#13;
course at upper secondary schools, 5 years in technical colleges). Most of&#13;
the programs administered by the Ministry of Labor, however, are less than one&#13;
year.&#13;
Fourth, in the case of schools administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Education, almost all of the students come directly from lower or upper&#13;
secondary schools. In the case of schools administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Labor, however, they accept not only young school leavers but also current&#13;
workers, workers who are out of employment, and those who intend to change&#13;
their occupation.&#13;
According to the Vocational Training Law (first enacted in 1958 and&#13;
completely revised in 1972), vocational training is basically classified into&#13;
two types: public vocational training and authorized vocational training in&#13;
an enterprise. The former is given to job-seekers, such as new graduates, and&#13;
workers changing employment. The latter is provided by the owner(s) of an&#13;
enterprise(s) to currently employed workers. We will concentrate on the&#13;
public type of vocational training here, since the enterprise training is&#13;
examined in Chapter III-(I). Table II-17 shows the types of vocational&#13;
training institutions and their training courses.&#13;

Voc. Training School&#13;
for the Handicapped     *            *            *&#13;
As shown in the table, four types of training are regulated by the&#13;
Law. Basic training (YOSEI KUNREN) has two course levels: the ordinary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
training course, mainly for lower secondary school leavers and the advanced&#13;
training course, mainly for upper secondary school leavers. Both courses aim&#13;
to give new school leavers the basic skills and knowledge necessary to be&#13;
multi-skilled workers. The duration of courses varies from six months to one&#13;
year, two years, or three years. Upgrading training (KOJO KUNREN) has four&#13;
types of courses: grade I trade certificate training course, grade II trade&#13;
certificate training course, supervisory training course and skill updating&#13;
training course. They are focussed on workers who have already basic skills&#13;
and knowledge. The skill updating training course, especially, aims at&#13;
helping them to catch up with technological progress in industries. The&#13;
duration of the courses is relatively short: 10 hours, 12 hours, 40 hours, or&#13;
between one and six months. Occupational capability redevelopment training&#13;
(NORYOKU SAIKAHATSU KUNREN) focusses especially on workers who intend to get&#13;
alternative jobs for which they are not trained. The duration of the training&#13;
is for two months, three months, six months, nine months or one year.&#13;
Instructor training (SHIDOIN KUNREN) aims at providing the necessary skills&#13;
and knowledge to be a vocational training instructor and is for four years.&#13;
This training is conducted only by the Institute of Vocational Training.&#13;
These four types of vocational training are carried out in the five&#13;
types of vocational training institutions, namely, vocational training&#13;
schools, junior vocational training colleges, skill development centers,&#13;
Institute of Vocational Training, and vocational training schools for the&#13;
handicapped. Table II-18 indicates the number of institutions and training&#13;
places. The first four types of institutions are briefly described below.&#13;

Source: Ministry of Labor&#13;
Vocational Training Schools (SHOKUGYO KUNRENKO)&#13;
This is the most popular type of vocational training institution.&#13;
Because most of the vocational training schools are established by the&#13;
prefectural government or municipal government, they can easily meet local&#13;
demand for vocational training. They provide basic training for lower and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
upper secondary school leavers, and upgrading training and redevelopment&#13;
training for adults. Vocational training schools managed by the Employment&#13;
Promotion Project Corporation (EPPC) (an organization established by the&#13;
national government) are now being converted into junior vocational training&#13;
colleges or skill development centers.&#13;
Junior Vocational Training Colleges (SHOKUGYO KUNREN TANKI DAICAKU)&#13;
Junior vocational training colleges were newly established in 1973&#13;
in order to meet manpower demands resulting from the rapid progress of science&#13;
and technology. The colleges are aimed at providing basic training for upper&#13;
secondary school leavers and producing technicians who have both skills and&#13;
knowledge in science and technology. The colleges have an important role in&#13;
the history of Japanese vocational education and training, because they are&#13;
the first institutions to try to combine practical skills and swintific&#13;
knowledge at the higher education level since the Meiji period. 7&#13;
Skill Development Centers (GINO KAIHATSU SENTA)&#13;
Skill development centers were established to provide upgrading&#13;
training and redevelopment training, especially for adults in employment or&#13;
temporarily unemployed. Although there were only two centers in 1981, many of&#13;
the vocational training schools managed by EPPC are to be converted into skill&#13;
development centers within a few years. This is because the main purpose of&#13;
skill development centers is to help adult workers in employment to catch up&#13;
with technological progress and the unemployed to get new jobs more easily.&#13;
The centers are expected to play an important role from now on.&#13;
The Institute of Vocational Training (SHOKUGYO KUNREN DAIGAKUKO)&#13;
The Institute of Vocational Training was established in 1961 as a&#13;
center of the whole vocational training system. The main purpose of the&#13;
Institute is to produce professional vocational training instructors and to&#13;
carry out research and studies on vocational training. Its activities include&#13;
international technical cooperation such as providing training courses for&#13;
instructors from developing countries, and also for Japanese instructors who&#13;
intend to go to developing countries.&#13;
Expenditure&#13;
Lastly, let us briefly examine the expenditure on vocational&#13;
training. Table II-19 shows the national and local budget for vocational&#13;
training in 1982. "General account" is mainly spent on the prefectural&#13;
vocational training schools, "labor accident" payment on national vocational&#13;
training schools for the handicapped, "coal &amp; oil payment" on the training of&#13;
workers leaving mines, and "employment payment" on other purposes.&#13;

Source: Ministry of Labor.&#13;
Compared with the school expenditure administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Education (Tables II-15 and II-16), we can note the following two points from&#13;
this table. First, the amount of the expenditure for vocational training&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Labor is far less than that of the Ministry of&#13;
Education. The former in 1982 was only 0.8% of the latter in 1978. Second,&#13;
in the case of vocational training administered by the Ministry of Labor, the&#13;
national budget shares 78% and the local budget 22%, although in the case of&#13;
the program administered by the Ministry of Education, the national share is&#13;
only 30% and the local 54%.&#13;
3. Academic Qualification Society and Economic Development&#13;
Based on the previous examination of the Japanese education and&#13;
training system in the Meiji and contemporary periods, we will analyze, in&#13;
this section, the meaning and role of this system in Japanese economic&#13;
development.&#13;
It is important to understand that Japan is a so-called GAKUREKI&#13;
SHAKAI (academic qualification society). First, in Japan, important factors&#13;
of one's social life such as wage, promotion and social status are basically&#13;
determined by one's final academic qualification. Second, the purpose of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
one's education is not what one learns but what kind of academic qualfication&#13;
one gets. Third, almost all members of the society try to take part in the&#13;
fierce competition to go up the Ladder of academic qualification.&#13;
Table II-20 indicates the wage differential classified by academic&#13;
qualification. It is obvious from the table that there are distinctive&#13;
differentials among the different qualification levels. A university graduate&#13;
(male) can get Y 127,200 as his starting salary, and Y 262,600 as an average&#13;
salary of all ages, while a lower secondary school leaver (male) can get only&#13;
Y 91,000 and Y 204,200 respectively.&#13;

Table II-21 indicates the rates of return by educational level in&#13;
Japan. These data also show that the private rate of return from higher&#13;
education is 2-3% higher than that from secondary education.&#13;

Data II: Umetani, in World Bank, ibid, p. 85.&#13;
There are many other discriminations based on academic qualification&#13;
as well as the wage differentials. For example, not only some professional&#13;
occupations such as doctors and teachers, but also prospective positions in&#13;
government and enterprises are restricted to university graduates by the&#13;
written or unwritten codes.&#13;
Among university graduates, there is also discrimination based on&#13;
the name of the university. This is the so-called university nomination&#13;
system in employing new university graduates. This means that some of the&#13;
Japanese companies recruit new graduates exclusively from several "prestigious&#13;
universities." Graduates from other "nonprestigious universities" are not&#13;
even given the chance to take an interview. Table II-22 shows the percentage&#13;
of companies which adopt the university nomination system, classified by the&#13;
size of the companies. From this table, we can gather that the larger a&#13;
company is, the more it adopts the university nomination system. Only 31Z of&#13;
large companies (more than 5,000 workers) do not use any system of nomina-&#13;
tion. In spite of such a high rate of nomination, big companies succeed in&#13;
employing the necessary new graduates from nominated universities. The reason&#13;
is shown in Table II-23, which shows wage differentials classified by the size&#13;
of the companies. The average wage in small companies (10-99 workers) is only&#13;
70X of that in large companies.&#13;

Therefore, people know that to get a high salary in a big company,&#13;
they must go to university, especially a prestigious one, and to go to a&#13;
prestigious university, they must go to a prestigious upper secondary school,&#13;
to go to a prestigious upper secondary school, they must go to a prestigious&#13;
lower secondary school, and so on. In order to go up this educational ladder,&#13;
everybody has to take and pass the very competitive entrance examination at&#13;
each gateway. (The most important entrance examination is, of course, that to&#13;
university.) It is reported that pre-pre-kindergarten has failed to devise&#13;
adequate lhsts for two years olds and has decided to test their mothers&#13;
instead.-    This educational spiral is called "examination hell", in which&#13;
everybody's future is determined. Thus, the academic qualification society&#13;
has a sharp pyramid structure, which consists of, from the bottom, lower&#13;
secondary school leavers, upper secondary school leavers, junior college and&#13;
technical college graduates, and university graduates. Because the rate of&#13;
attendance at university has reached 35%, there is also stratification among&#13;
the universities. Among more than one thousand institutions for higher&#13;
education in Japan, the University of Tokyo is located at the top of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
pyramid. It is followed by other national and prestigious private&#13;
universities such as Kyoto University, Hitotsubashi University, Waseda&#13;
University and Keio University. Many other public and private universities&#13;
rank after these universities.&#13;
In the academic qualification society, this educational ladder-&#13;
through entrance examinations is almost the only channel of social mobility.&#13;
An OECD educational mission to Japan, therefore, reported that Japan was not&#13;
an aristocratic society, where one's class and life are determined by one's&#13;
birth, but a degreeocratic society, where one's clasT9and life are determined&#13;
by the entrance examination at the age of eighteen. -&#13;
In the academic qualification society, because the kind of&#13;
qualification one gets is more important than what one learns in school, every&#13;
student studies only the subjects related to the entrance examination, namely,&#13;
general subjects rather than vocational ones. Therefore, the vocational&#13;
course at upper secondary school is ranked at the bottom of the upper -&#13;
secondary school strata. Table II-24 indicates the change of the rate of&#13;
attendance at upper secondary school and the share of students between general&#13;
and vocational courses.&#13;

The table shows that the share of the general course has constantly&#13;
increased since 1970.(and that of the vocational course has decreased).&#13;
Furthermore, columns (4) and (5) show the percentages of students of the same&#13;
age who are enrolled in general and vocational courses. The enrollment rate&#13;
of the general course has continuously increased from 30.8X in 1955 to 66.3%&#13;
in 1983. We can safely conclude from this fact that people prefer the general&#13;

Vocational training administered by the Ministry of Labor is also&#13;
not popular among the school leavers. Table II-26 shows the rate of&#13;
utilization of the places for basic training. As shown in the table, in spite&#13;
of the reduction of training places, only 70-80% of the places have always&#13;
been filled.&#13;

As a result of this bias toward general education, about 70% of&#13;
upper secondary leavers and 60% of university graduates are not trained, when&#13;
they start working. To get the necesary skills and knowledge for their job&#13;
they are trained in a company. But, why doesn't the company employ school&#13;
leavers who have already received vocational training in school? And what&#13;
role does this educational system play in Japan's economic development? In&#13;
order to answer these questions, we should note the following two points about&#13;
the role of the Japanese school system.&#13;
First, from what we have observed so far, all pupils and students in&#13;
Japan have to compete and study general subjects very hard for many years. As&#13;
a result, a well-educated mass of people with a strong background in general&#13;
education is produced. They have an advantage, because in a time of rapid&#13;
technological progress, a deep and wide range of general knowledge is more&#13;
useful than specific vocational skills, which may soon become obsolete.&#13;
Second, the Japanese education system works as a sophisticated&#13;
device for selection. In the academic qualification society, the name of the&#13;
university and its department gives little information about what students&#13;
learned there. However, it indicates the level of their general ability among&#13;
the whole of society. General ability does not mean specific skills or&#13;
knowledge but their potential. That is why Japanese companies accept the&#13;
university nomination system. By employing graduates from "first class"&#13;
universities, they can expect them to have " first class" general ability and&#13;
potential. Since Japanese companies adopt a so-called lifetime employment&#13;
system, what they are most concerned about in employing new graduates is their&#13;
lifetime potential capability. Once they get a "golden egg", as long as they&#13;
foster it properly, it can be expected to be a " golden hen" in the future (We&#13;
will examine how they foster it in the next chapter).&#13;
Of course, the academic qualification society has brought about a&#13;
serious social problem named the "diploma disease" by Dore, but generally&#13;
speaking, nothing seems to have changed so far.&#13;
"The system works well enough ----; provided one thinks of it as an&#13;
enormously elaborated, very expensive intelligence testing system&#13;
with some educational spin-off, rather than the other way round.&#13;
One suspects that Japan's more conservative leaders, though they are&#13;
prepared to shake their heads over the system with those who deplore&#13;
it, are secretly well satisfied. The examination hell sorts the&#13;
sheep from the goats; a man who can't take the psychological strain&#13;
would be no use anyway. If you need convincing of the virtues of&#13;
meritocracy - of getting the top brain in the top place - look, they&#13;
would say, at our economic growth record". (Dore, The Diploma&#13;
Disease, pp. 48-50)&#13;
Part of Japan's economic growth is sustained by this examination hell.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
THE ROLE OF COMPANIES IN THE UPGRADING&#13;
AND UTILIZATION OF MANPOWER&#13;
1. Education and Training in a Company&#13;
/This section aims at examining the in-company education and training&#13;
system.20 As indicated in Table III-1, 85% of the Japanese labor force is&#13;
engaged in the private sector of secondary and tertiary industries, and they&#13;
produce more than 90% of total GDP. Manufacturing industry employs 24% of the&#13;
labor force and produces 30% of GDP. Since most of the labor force is working&#13;
in companies, it is meaningful to examine their education and training system&#13;
in order to understand the role of manpower in Japan's economic development.&#13;
In the following we will first briefly look at: (a) government policies for&#13;
skill acquisition in a company, then, examine (b) the education and training&#13;
system in a company.&#13;

(a)  Government Policies for Skill Acquisition in a Company&#13;
The Vocational Training Law, which represents the Government's&#13;
vocational training polift7s has two origins, namely, skilled workers training&#13;
and vocational guidance.-&#13;
The Government began to be concerned about in-plant skilled workers&#13;
training in the late 1930s, mainly because of the military requirement. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
1939, the ordinance of skilled workers training in factories and workshops was&#13;
enacted,and large factories were obliged to train skilled workers with a&#13;
government subsidy. Although the law was abolished at the end of World War&#13;
II, the idea of in-plant skilled workers training was retained in a newly&#13;
enacted Labor Standard Law of 1947. It is important to note that the Labor&#13;
Standard Law regulated in-company vocational training from the viewpoint of&#13;
criticizing apprenticeship. This is because in the pre-war period, there was&#13;
severe exploitation of young workers under the name of apprenticeship. There-&#13;
fore, the Law aimed to establish a modern skill acquisition system in a&#13;
company. This is the origin of authorized vocational training in an enter-&#13;
prise(s) regulated by the present vocational training law.&#13;
Another origin of the present vocational training policies is&#13;
vocational guidance which started in the 1920s. In order to cope with the&#13;
unemployment problem, the Government established vocational training insti-&#13;
tutions, since there was a shortage of skilled workers even at a time of mass&#13;
unemployment. In 1947, after World War II, the Employment Security Law was&#13;
enacted to give the unemployed vocational training in public institutions.&#13;
This has developed into the present system of public training institutions&#13;
which we examined in Chapter II-(2)-(b).&#13;
These two training programs, namely, skilled workers training based&#13;
on the Labor Standard Law, and vocational guidance based on the Employment&#13;
Security Law, were unified into the Vocational Training Law in 1958, just&#13;
before Japan started its high economic growth (the Law was completely revised&#13;
in 1969 in order to meet Japan's rapid economic development). The Law&#13;
requires the Minister of Labor to prepare the basic scheme of vocational&#13;
training which indicates the fundamental direction of the policies for&#13;
vocational training and skills certification (Articles 5), and each prefecture&#13;
governor is to prepare the prefectural scheme of vocational training based on&#13;
the basic scheme (Article 6).&#13;
The first and the second basic scheme based on the revised&#13;
Vocational Training Law were planned for 1971-75 and 1976-80 respectively, and&#13;
the third scheme (for 1981-85) is now being enforced. The aims of the present&#13;
basic scheme of vocational training, which is subtitled "Preparation for&#13;
career training system",are: First, basic vocational training should be&#13;
provided for young persons who are going to start working, according to their&#13;
ability and aptitude. It is necessary to strengthen the relation between&#13;
school education and public vocational training. Second, training for&#13;
currently employed workers should be strengthened, because we can expect&#13;
structural change in industries, technological innovation, extension of&#13;
working career and demand for self-development, etc. In order to cope with&#13;
this situation, education and training organized by employers has to be&#13;
developed, and supported by public vocational training. Third, occupational&#13;
capability redevelopment training should be provided, especially for persons&#13;
leaving and changing occupations and women intending to work. Fourth, the&#13;
evaluation system for vocational capability should be provided according to&#13;
each stage of the working career, and the skill certification system must be&#13;
expanded. Fifth, Japan should play an important role in international&#13;
technical cooperation through vocational training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Within this comprehensive scheme, we can observe the concerns in the&#13;
second and third points corresponding with the two original purposes of&#13;
vocational training policies mentioned above. We shall focus on the second&#13;
point, namely, goverment policy for authorized in-company vocational training.&#13;
(We have already examined vocational training in the public institutions in&#13;
the previous chapter.)&#13;
The Vocational Training Law regulated that prefectural governors can&#13;
authorize vocational training conducted by employers, their association,&#13;
juridical persons, or trade unions, when they meet the prescribed standard&#13;
(Article 24), and authorized employers or associations can establish&#13;
vocational training schools, junior vocational colleges or skill development&#13;
centers (Article 25). The national and prefectural governments are required&#13;
to provide various types of assistance and incentives for both employers and&#13;
employees undertaking authorized in-company vocational training. The&#13;
assistance and incentives include: traineeship loan, training allowance for&#13;
the unemployed, financial assistance to smaller enterprises with less than 300&#13;
employees (in retail and services less than 50, and in wholesale less than&#13;
100), professional advisory an2d institutional services, incentive grant for&#13;
paid educational leave, etc.   -   In 1981, Y 2,092 million was subsidized for&#13;
managerial expenses in 812 authorized in-company vocational training schemes,&#13;
Y 186 million for 14 vocational training in2 tutions, and Y 172 million for&#13;
199 items of vocational training equipment.M     Although, compared with the&#13;
government expenditure on school education (Table II-14), these amounts are&#13;
very small, it should be noted that the Government gives private companies&#13;
financial assistance in order to promote vocational training.&#13;
Authorized in-company vocational training is performed by single&#13;
enterprises or an association of enterprises. The former is implemented by&#13;
relatively large companies, and the latter by relatively small companies.&#13;
Table III-2 indicates the number of authorized in-company vocational training&#13;
institutions and the number of employers organizing the training insti-&#13;
tutions. From this table, we can observe the following points. First, the&#13;
percentages of the number of single employers, which are relatively big&#13;
enterprises, are only 0.2-0.3%. However, they share 26-28% of the total&#13;
authorized vocational training institutions. Second, 99.7 or 99.8% of&#13;
employers who organize authorized vocational training institutions are&#13;
performing the training as associations. This fact implies that almost all&#13;
enterprises which use the authorized in-company vocational training system,&#13;
are relatively small companies.&#13;

It is important, however, to note that the total number of enter-&#13;
prises in Japan was more than 5.8 million in 1978. Therefore, the percentage&#13;
of enterprises which have authorized in-company vocational training institu-&#13;
tions individually or as an association is only 1.7% of all enterprises.&#13;
Almost all companies are performing employees' training in another way, rather&#13;
than using the authorized vocational training system. We will examine this in&#13;
the next section.&#13;
(b) Education and Training System in Japanese Companies&#13;
Although the purpose of this section is to examine the in-company&#13;
education and training system, it is important, first of all, to clarify the&#13;
difference among companies. Roughly speaking, Japanese companies are&#13;
classified into two groups by their size, namely, large companies, and small&#13;
and medium companies. According to the Fundamental Law of Small and Medium&#13;
Enterprises, small and medium companies are defined by the number of employees&#13;
or the amount of capital.   In the case of manufacturing business, for example,&#13;
small and medium companies are defined as those with less than 300 employees&#13;
or less than Y 100 million of the capital.    Table III-3 indicates the share of&#13;
large and small and medium enterprises classified by industries.     From this&#13;
table, we can observe that more than 99% of enterprises are small or medium&#13;
companies in any industries. Although in the following part of this paper, we&#13;
will mainly concentrate on companies in the manufacturing industry, it is&#13;
&#13;

Table III-4 shows shares of the number of businesses, number of&#13;
workers, amount of gross and net product among small, medium and large&#13;
companies in manufacturing industry. From this table, we can observe the&#13;
following points. First, although the number of large companies is only 0.5%&#13;
of all companies, they produce nearly half of the products. Second, although&#13;
small companies share 87.2% in number, their share of gross product is only&#13;
12.6%. These differentials among companies affect their in-company education&#13;
and training performance.&#13;

Table III-5 shows the difference in education and training&#13;
performance between large enterprises, and small and medium enterprises. We&#13;
can observe from this table that 42% of large companies have regular and&#13;
systematic education and training programs, while in the case of small and&#13;
medium companies, only 6.3% have them. This-is mainly because of the&#13;
difference of financial capability of education and training.&#13;

examine the system of in-company education and training in the following part&#13;
of this section, it is important to remember the differentials among companies&#13;
that we have observed so far.&#13;

First of all, it is important to note the following three points&#13;
about the education and training system in Japanese companies. First, the&#13;
system covers almost all levels of employees in a company, from blue collar&#13;
workers to white collar workers, new employees to old employees, clerical&#13;
staff to general managers. Second, under the lifetime employment system in&#13;
Japan, this means a lifetime education and training system for all workers.&#13;
All employees in a company continuously take various types of education and&#13;
training at each stage of their working career until they retire. For the&#13;
company, this system means that education and training for employees are a&#13;
long-term investment in the future development of human resources. Third,&#13;
Japanese companies use the term of "education and training" in a broad&#13;
sense. For example, when some of the managers state that a company is DOJO&#13;
(literally, traditional training place where one practices the way of martial&#13;
arts) of life, it means2g7ery activity in a company is a part of education and&#13;
training for employees.-     Concretely speaking, they include not only on-the-&#13;
job training and study seminars, but also formal and informal meetings at any&#13;
level, company communications, purchasing specialized magazines, moral stories&#13;
from the president, and private counseling, etc. Even recreation such as&#13;
parties, festivals and short trips organized by a company are sometimes&#13;
regarded as a part of education and training.&#13;
Let us start by looking at the main method of education and training&#13;
in companies. Tables III-7 and III-8 show the methods of education and&#13;
training for managers and employees respectively, in manufacturing industry.&#13;

The differences between Large, and small and medium companies are&#13;
mainly derived from the differentials of financial capability of companies as&#13;
we examined before (Table III-6). We should also, however, note that there is&#13;
a difference in the needs of manpower between large companies and small and&#13;
medium companies. Generally speaking, the former require manpower who have&#13;
special knowledge and can make managerial policies or planning of R&amp;D 6yhile&#13;
the latter require those who have leadership in production and sales.-&#13;
We will roughly classify these methods into on-the-job education and&#13;
training, and other institutional training, and briefly examine them in the&#13;
following.&#13;
On-the-job education and training is a very important method of&#13;
employee education and training in a company. It has the following&#13;
features: First, on-the-job education and training can be performed&#13;
individually based on one's educational needs and personal character. Second,&#13;
through on-the-job education and training, one can acquire the knowledge and&#13;
skills which are directly related to one's job. Third, on-the-job education&#13;
and training can be performed anytime and anywhere. In the case of on-the-job&#13;
training in Japanese companies, however, we should not miss another crucial&#13;
role, namely the formation of human relations in a company. The objectives of&#13;
on-the-job training are not only teaching some specific skills and knowledge&#13;
but also building tight human relations between staff and their chief.&#13;
Institutional training can be defined as vocational education and&#13;
trainin21based on a systematic curriculum for a certain period in a certain&#13;
class.-    We can classify the institutional training into four types by its&#13;
organizer: (a) institutional training organized by a company; (b) institu-&#13;
tional training organized by an association of companies; (c) institutional&#13;
training organized by formal educational institutions; and (d) institutional&#13;
training organized by specialized management institutions. The first type is&#13;
the most popular method of training after on-the-job training in large&#13;
companies (Table III-8). The second type is performed mainly by small and&#13;
medium companies. The third type includes a program to send employees (or&#13;
employers themselves) to formal educational institutions (for example, univer-&#13;
sities, special training schools and miscellaneous schools), public vocational&#13;
training institutions (for example, vocational training schools, and skill&#13;
development centers) or other public study seminars organized by companies&#13;
associations, prefectural or municipal governments. The fourth type is&#13;
performed by specialized organizations such as the Japan productivity centers,&#13;
and the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers. In the following section,&#13;
we will concentrate on the first type, namely, institutional training&#13;
organized by a company, since other types of institutional training are&#13;
usually used as a supplement to the first type.&#13;
Diagram III-I shows the in-company institutional training system of&#13;
Nippon Steel Corporation, which is one of the largest companies in Japan.&#13;
This is a typical education and training system of large Japanese manufac-&#13;
turing companies. As shown in the diagram, the in-company institutional&#13;
training system is composed of two types of education and training, namely,&#13;
specialized education and training, and stratified education and training.&#13;
The former includes programs for white-collar employees and for blue-collar&#13;

employees, and both of them are a vertical system in which some special skills&#13;
or knowledge are accumulatively instructed. Employees in any position take&#13;
this program according to their needs. For example, computer training,&#13;
foreign language course, safety training, in the diagram are typical programs&#13;
of specialized education and training. The latter is a horizontal system, in&#13;
which all the employees in the same positions get trained.&#13;
As we examined in Chapter II-(3), Japanese companies hire new&#13;
graduates very carefully and selectively, paying attention to their potential&#13;
rather than their specific vocational skills or knowledge. Since Japanese&#13;
companies have such a long-term perspective, initial education and training&#13;
for new employees is very important. Generally speaking, a one or two weeks&#13;
intensive program is provided for all freshmen and women. Most of the large&#13;
companies have their own training center, where all trainees stay for the&#13;
period of training. Although the basic purpose of this orientation program is&#13;
to give an introduction to the company and a basic knowledge of the business,&#13;
the most important objective is to motivate new employees to work in that&#13;
company. The fundamental philosophy of the company, which is usually highly&#13;
society-oriented, is given in a lecture by the president or the executives,&#13;
and freshmen are urged to establish an attitude of mind as full-fledged&#13;
members of society and the company. Other spiritual attitudes such as pride,&#13;
self-esteem, sense of duty and responsibility are also emphasized. It is also&#13;
important to note that one of the most required virtues in Japanese companies&#13;
is a sense of harmony and teamwork, since all employees work in the same&#13;
company for the rest of their lives. In order to promote this sense, for&#13;
example, some companies oblige all new employees to stay in the company&#13;
dormitory for at least their first year. A retired ex-employee of the company&#13;
becomes the superintendent of the dormitory and takes care of both the private&#13;
and public life of new employees, and once a y8er, the president of the&#13;
company is invited to the dormitory festival. &#13;
Stratified education and training programs continue every one to two&#13;
years until new employees become middle-level manpower. The duration of the&#13;
program is usually less than one week. The main objective is to promote&#13;
employees' consciousness and understanding of their role in the company rather&#13;
than teaching specific knowledge, which is learned in specialized education&#13;
and training courses or on-the-job training. Together with ordinary lecturing&#13;
and seminars, several imported methods such as role playing, sensitivity&#13;
training, transaction analysis, and case method, are often used to provide the&#13;
opportunities to meet the executives, lecturers, and other employees.&#13;
In regard to managers' education and training, the main objective is&#13;
to understand the whole system of the company from the managerial point of&#13;
view. They often have informal meetings with managers in other divisions or&#13;
departments to discuss managerial problems. Another important objective of&#13;
managers' training is to learn how to guide their staff and raise their&#13;
morale. They are required to have many formal and informal meetings with&#13;
their staff.  For example, in some   cg!panies, general managers have lunch with&#13;
every staff member on his birthday.-     They also organize recreational&#13;
activities for their staff such as sports, hiking and parties. The staff's&#13;
family are also invited to understand the company. They expect to develop a&#13;
total human relationship with their staff through these activities. An ideal&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
manager is a person who can get full credit with his staff, and this is an&#13;
important objective of managers' education and training, as well as learning&#13;
some specific knowledge and skills of management.&#13;
From the examination so far, we can summarize the following two&#13;
points. First, major Japanese companies perform long-term and systematic&#13;
education and training for all employees. Second, the main objectives of&#13;
education and training are not only learning specific knowledge and skills but&#13;
also improving employees' moral and human relations. We will examine, in the&#13;
following section, why Japanese companies can perform such long-term, systema-&#13;
tic and human relation oriented education and training. This is closely&#13;
related to the so-called Japanese management system.&#13;
2. Japanese Management and Manpower&#13;
A great number of studies about the Japanese management system have&#13;
already been done both in Japan and abroad. This is mainly because Japanese&#13;
high economic growth in the 1960s and relatively good economic performance in&#13;
coping with two oil criles in the 1970s attracted strong worldwide interest in&#13;
her management style.30' The purpose of this section is to suggest that&#13;
Japan's management system for manpower iy one of "internal accumulation"&#13;
rather than of "external procurement".31- In the following section, we will&#13;
analyse this point from two aspects of the Japanese style of management: (a)&#13;
the employment and promotion system; and (b) the wage system.&#13;
(a) The Employment and Promotion System&#13;
Basic policies of the internal accumulation type of manpower management&#13;
are, first to hire capable new graduates, second to educate and train them&#13;
intensively in a company, and third to keep them in the same company for the&#13;
whole period of their working careers. We have already examined the first and&#13;
second point in the previous sections. It is important, however, to remember&#13;
that in hiring new graduates, Japanese companies are concerned about their&#13;
general ability and potential rather than specific knowledge and skills, and&#13;
in training them, special emphasis is put on the improvement of human&#13;
relations as well as teaching vocational knowledge and skills.&#13;
The third point is the so-called life-time employment system, which&#13;
is widely recognized as one of the basic characterictics of Japanese manage-&#13;
ment. However, it is important to note that there is no legal obligation in&#13;
this system. In other words, life-time employment is merely a custom of&#13;
Japanese companies and neither employers nor employees have any obligation of&#13;
life-time employment. Employers can dismiss their workers anytime (although&#13;
an announcement is required) and workers can also leave their company any-&#13;
time. Therefore, there must be some reasons why both employers and employees&#13;
in Japanese companies try to keep the life-time employment system.&#13;
Let us first examine the case of employees. First of all, life-time&#13;
employment gives stability to a worker's life and he can make a steady career&#13;
plan on the basis of the security of his employment. Aged workers, espe-&#13;
cially, tend to prefer staying in the same company where they have worked.&#13;
Second, because Japanese companies adopt a seniority wage system, the longer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
workers stay in the same company, the higher the salary they can get (we will&#13;
examine the details in the next section). Third, in Japan it is very diffi-&#13;
cult to leave one company and get a better job in another company, because&#13;
most of the companies, especially the large ones, hire only new graduates as&#13;
regular staff. Fourth, traditional ethics in Japanese society require that&#13;
once one gets a job in a company, one should not easily change to another&#13;
company.&#13;
Employers also have reasons to keep the life-time employment&#13;
system. First, they can make long-term manpower planning. When they make a&#13;
large investment in education and training, it is essential for them to be&#13;
sure that their employees will stay for a long period in the company. Second,&#13;
by providing many years of education and training, employers can adapt their&#13;
workers to the tradition of the company, and expect high morale and loyalty.&#13;
Third, it is difficult to recruit skilled and experienced workers from the&#13;
labor market outside of the company, since capable workers are trained in a&#13;
company and stay there. They are also prudent in hiring workers from other&#13;
companies, since it often causes friction between new and old employees.&#13;
Keeping harmony among workers is one of the most important roles of manage-&#13;
ment. Fourth, employers also have traditional ethics that require they should&#13;
not easily dismiss their workers, since both employers and employees regard&#13;
their company as a kind of family. Employers' paternalism and employees'&#13;
loyalty are two of the most significant cultural factors of Japanese manage-&#13;
ment, and the life-time employment system is reinforced by this.&#13;
Based on this life-time employment system, employees in a Japanese&#13;
company form an internal labor market inside the company, which is distin-&#13;
guished from the ordinary external labor market. This internal labor market&#13;
has the following characteristics. First, it is a closed system, in which&#13;
there is only one entrance and one exit. Employees enter this market at the&#13;
begining of their working careers and exit at the time of their retirement.&#13;
Second, it is a competitive market, in which every employee is in a race for&#13;
promotion. Although seniority and academic qualifications determine the&#13;
initial conditions in this market, those in similar age and academic qualifi-&#13;
cation groups have equal opportunities for promotion. They are very often&#13;
transferred among departments during their working careers, and the company&#13;
gradually examines their merits and aptitudes. The most capable men among the&#13;
white collar workers, who win the long promotion race in this internal market,&#13;
become the president or the executives of the company1 Blue collars workers&#13;
also have an opportunity for promotion up to foreman.       This is called the&#13;
internal promotion system. Third, this internal labor market is flexible in&#13;
job allocation. The company freely transfers its employees in this market&#13;
according to its needs. This means that as long as the company accumulates&#13;
enough human resources, it can flexibly cope with the changing economic&#13;
situation by mobilizing its own manpower.&#13;
Diagram III-2 summarizes these characteristics mentioned above, and&#13;
compares this system with that of external procurement. It is important,&#13;
however, to note that these characteristics are only tendencies of Japanese&#13;
companies and do not exist in a pure sense. Generally speaking, the larger&#13;

the company, the more they have these tendencies. We should also note that&#13;
the most important factor of this internal accumulation type of manpower&#13;
management is to keep the mobility of all employees in a company. This means&#13;
that in Japanese companies, the type of post has a very loose relation with&#13;
the worker's qualification. In the case of European or American companies,&#13;
which have an external procurement type of manpower management, job content&#13;
and responsibility are clearly defined together with qualification for the&#13;
person who is applying for the post. Therefore, everyone who has this&#13;
qualification (both inside and outside the company) can apply for the post,&#13;
and the company hires the person for this particular job. Workers have to get&#13;
their qualifications at their own expense, say, by going to training school,&#13;
but if they have the qualifications, they can apply for a post at any&#13;
company. We may say that these companies employ not the worker himself, but&#13;
his qualification, namely, his specific vocational knowledge or skills.&#13;
Therefore, when the post become redundant, the company does not try to&#13;
transfer the worker into another post, but immediately lays him off.&#13;
Japanese companies, however, look at employees' potential and train&#13;
them as flexible manpower at company expense. Since they pay the cost of&#13;
their employees' education and training, when the post become unnecessary,&#13;
they try to transfer the workers into another post. In other words, Japanese&#13;
companies keep training their workers so that they can mobilize them at any&#13;
time in any way. Therefore, in Japanese companies most of the posts do not&#13;
require specific,qualifications, and the job content and responsibility of the&#13;
post are not clearly determined. We may say that none of the newly employed&#13;
graduates know their specific duties in a company, when they are hired. All&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
of them are expected to have the potential to do any type of job, and the&#13;
company trains them to do so. This flexibility of manpower is a strong&#13;
advantage of Japanese companies.&#13;
(b) The Wage System&#13;
The compensation system in Japanese companies is also closely&#13;
related to their employment system. The compensation system consists of a&#13;
wage system and a fringe benefit system, the former includes basic salary and&#13;
other allowances. In the following part of this section, we will concentrate&#13;
on the wage system and examine its characteristics. Table III-9 indicates the&#13;
composition of wages in Japanese companies. As shown in the table, 83.5% of&#13;
the fixed wage is a "basic salary". The basic salary is the most fundamental&#13;
part of the salary, and it is used as a standard to determine other allowances&#13;
and benefits. The role of the basic salary in Japanese companies is similar&#13;
to that of the wage rate in European and American companies.&#13;

There are three types of basic salary in Japanese companies, namely,&#13;
basic salary based on job classification (SHOKUMUKYU), basic salary based on&#13;
job capability (SHOKUNOKYU) and basic salary based on seniority (NENKOKYU).&#13;
Table III-10 indicates the percentages of companies which adopt these salary&#13;
types.&#13;

SHOKUMUKYU is the salary which is paid for the job itself. It is&#13;
assumed that there is a fixed relation between job classification and salary&#13;
stratification. Therefore, the salary is paid not for the worker but for&#13;
his/her job. This type of salary is mainly used in European and American&#13;
companies, which have an external procurement type of manpower policy. In&#13;
Japanese companies, however, SHOKUMUKYU is not a popular type of salary as&#13;
shown in the table. This is mainly because Japanese companies have an&#13;
internal accumulation type of manpower policy, and try to keep the flexibility&#13;
of their employees. If a worker's salary and his job are tightly linked, it&#13;
will be difficult to transfer him from one job to another. In order to freely&#13;
mobilize all employees, their salary must be determined not by their job&#13;
classification but by other personal factors.&#13;
NENKOKYU is one alternative. This basic salary is determined by&#13;
personal factors such as age, years of employment, academic qualification,&#13;
sex, etc.  Employees' salaries increase with little or no relation to their&#13;
job classification or their capability, and among those in the same academic&#13;
qualification and sex group, the older workers earn the higher salary.    We may&#13;
say that this is a seniority wage system in a pure sense. However, this type&#13;
of salary system has two main problems. First, as the Japanese workers age,&#13;
the cost of their salaries becomes a heavy financial burden for the&#13;
companies. Second, it is difficult to reflect a worker's merit in his salary,&#13;
and it may weaken the morale of capable employees. This is why as shown in&#13;
the table, only 11.7Z of companies adopt only this type of basic salary.&#13;
SHOKUWNOKYU, basic salary based on job capability, is the other&#13;
alternative. Job capability means not only an employee's realized capability&#13;
in his present job but also his potential capability for a future job. This&#13;
type of salary enables a company to keep a loose relation between an&#13;
employee's salary and his job, and at the same time, to reflect his merit in&#13;
his salary. Another advantage of this type of salary is that both the company&#13;
and the workers are concerned about education and training, because workers&#13;
can expect a higher salary by developing their potential, and the company can&#13;
accumulate more capable manpower by providing education and training. How-&#13;
ever, the most difficult point in this salary type is how to measure a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
worker's potential capability. Although elaborate methods of personnel&#13;
appraisal have been developed, there is still some risk, because once&#13;
employees feel the appraisal is unfair, their morale is severely distorted.&#13;
This is why most Japanese companies accept the combination of NENKOKYU and&#13;
SHOKUNOKYU as shown in Table III-10 (64.1X).&#13;
Another important characteristic of the wage system in Japanese&#13;
company is TEIKISHOKYU (yearly salary increase). This means that every&#13;
employee's (both white and blue collar workers) salary is raised every year at&#13;
the same time. The rates of increase are determined automatically by the&#13;
prescribed table, or by appraising individual capability and achievements, or&#13;
by a combination of these two methods. As shown in Table III-lI, 87% of&#13;
Japanese companies adopt this system of yearly salary increase. This yearly&#13;
salary increase can be performed both for SHOKUNOKYU and NENKOKYU but not for&#13;

SHOKUMUKYU. As a result of this system, wages among Japanese workers are&#13;
differentiated by their age and length of working years. As shown in Table&#13;
III-12, their wages increase constantly until they are fifty five years old,&#13;
the ordinary retirement age. This is the so-called seniority wage system in&#13;
Japanese companies. This system has advantages for both workers and the&#13;
company. For workers, this system guarantees the increase of their salary&#13;
according to their age, and therefore, enables them to meet their needs at&#13;
each stage of their life cycle. For companies, this system guarantees the&#13;

workers' life-time commitment to the company, and it can use this system as an&#13;
incentive to develop each employee's potential capability.&#13;
However, this seniority wage system has been changing recently,&#13;
mainly because of the increase in cost as the result of workers aging. Some&#13;
of the companies stop the automatic yearly increase at the middle of their&#13;
workers' careers, say, at the age of forty, or reduce the rate of increase for&#13;
the older employees.&#13;
3. Workers' Participation and Economic Development&#13;
In the previous sections, we analyzed the characteristics of&#13;
education and training in Japanese companies and their management policies for&#13;
the utilization of manpower. The purpose of this section is to examine how&#13;
Japanese companies have been able to develop Japan's economy in this manage-&#13;
ment style. Although Japan's economic success can be explained by reasons&#13;
other than companies' management policies, (for example, institutional reforms&#13;
after World War II, appropriate Government leadership, and favorable inter-&#13;
national environment), we will concentrate on the utilization of manpower in&#13;
Japanese companies and in particular, workers' participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
We use the term "workers' participation" in a broad sense, which&#13;
includes at least the following three points. First, workers' participation&#13;
means each worker's positive commitment to his/her job. He performs his duty&#13;
not only because he has to, but also because he can get self-fulfillment&#13;
through his job. We can expect the best result from a worker when he actively&#13;
involves himself in his job. Self-esteem and pride in doing his duty are&#13;
important factors. Second, workers' participation means every worker's&#13;
voluntary commitment to the job. Not only white-collar but also blue-collar&#13;
workers should actively participate in production and management of the&#13;
company according to their duties. Third, workers' participation includes&#13;
workers' cooperation. An employer cannot achieve his aim without the positive&#13;
cooperation of his employees nor can employees improve their production and&#13;
working conditions without their employer's understanding. The more they&#13;
cooperate, the better results they can get. We may say that participation is&#13;
the key to utilize human resources, because it motivates workers and enables&#13;
them to maximize their ability both as individuals and as a group. We may say&#13;
that one of the most important factors of the success of Japanese companies is&#13;
this workers' participation. In the following part of this section, we will&#13;
examine the three aspects of workers' participation, namely, (a) labor partic-&#13;
ipation in management, (b) suggestion system, and (c) company-wide quality&#13;
control. Finally, we will consider some effects of these management policies&#13;
and workers' participation on Japanese economic development.&#13;
(a) Labor participation in management&#13;
Labor participation in management usually includes collective&#13;
bargaining, labor-management joint consultation, ownership sharing, profit&#13;
sharing, and workers' participation in the board of executives. Although it&#13;
is not our purpose to describe all of these systems, we should note the&#13;
following points as characteristics of Japanese labor-management relations.&#13;
Table III-13: NUMBER OF UNIONS AND THEIR MEMBERS (1975)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
First, almost all Japanese companies adopt the so-called enterprise&#13;
unionism. As shown in Table III-13, 94% of total unions are enterprise&#13;
unions. Since all the members of a union are, at the same time, employees of&#13;
the company, the interests of labor and management can be matched relatively&#13;
easily. After the first oil crisis, for instance, Japanese unions accepted&#13;
the relatively lower level of wage increase compared with the higher inflation&#13;
rate. This is mainly because unions adopted a long-term point of view, and&#13;
gave priority to the security of employment rather than to the increase in&#13;
wage. As a result, Japan was able to avoid mass unemployment and recover her&#13;
economy relatively quickly.&#13;
Second, the internal promotion system also contributes to labor&#13;
participation in management. In Japanese companies, it is common for a worker&#13;
to stay in a company first as an employee, then as a leader of the union, and&#13;
again become an employee of the company. The post of union leader is consid-&#13;
ered a good opportunity to learn labor-management relations, and those who&#13;
have held the post are usually promoted to management positions.    TO  union&#13;
representative may even become a member of the board of directors.-3&#13;
Third, we should also note the decision-making system of Japanese&#13;
companies. Since, as we saw in the previous section, each worker's job&#13;
content and responsibility are not clearly prescribed in Japanese companies,&#13;
decision-making is performed collectively involving many workers in the&#13;
company. Under this decision-making system, most of the decision plans are&#13;
first provided by ordinary employees or lower managers. They have several&#13;
formal and informal discussions with other managers at the same level whose&#13;
sectional interest may be related to this decision, and consensus among them&#13;
is sought. Once they reach consensus, the decision plan is raised to the&#13;
senior managers' level. They repeat almost the same process and accumulate&#13;
their ideas and consensus to the plan. In this way, the decision plan goes&#13;
through a hierarchy of the company up to general manager, executives, or the&#13;
president, according to the significance of the decision. Although the final&#13;
decision is taken by the top management, it is the result of many workers'&#13;
consensus. Especially for lower level workers, this system provides an oppor-&#13;
tunity to participate in decision-making. Therefore, once a decision has been&#13;
adopted, all the workers who are familiar with the decision cooperate and the&#13;
objective can be achieved smoothly.&#13;
Fourth, labor participation in management is also supported by the&#13;
community-oriented mental attitude of Japanese workers and managers. Under&#13;
the Japanese management system which we have examined so far, both management&#13;
and workers begin to feel that they are living in the same community and&#13;
sharing their life and fortune with each other. They often regard their&#13;
company as a big family and this emotional relationship promotes the sense of&#13;
participation.&#13;
(b) Suggestion System&#13;
The suggestion system aims to collect workers' ideas and opinions&#13;
about their job and company, and improve the company's system and produc-&#13;
tivity. As shown in Table III-14, almost three quarters of all companies have&#13;
the suggestion system, and more than 80% of workers are involved in it. In&#13;
the case of large companies, the corresponding percentage is more than 90%.&#13;

This nationwide suggestion system is coordinated by the Japan Research Asso-&#13;
ciation for the Suggestion System, which was established in 1958. Suggestions&#13;
mainly concern improving work methods, saving materials and energy, improving&#13;
the working enviroment, and updating equipment and machinery.&#13;
For employees, the suggestion system provides opportunities to&#13;
realize their ideas and improve their working conditions. For employers, good&#13;
suggestions lead to increased productivity. They can also expect a raise in&#13;
workers' morale, when their suggestion is adopted. Table III-15 indicates the&#13;
trend of the suggestion system. We can observe the following points from this&#13;
table. First, the total number of suggestions has increased from 3.3 million&#13;
in 1973 to 32.2 million in 1981, an almost ten-fold increase in eight years.&#13;

Second, accordingly,-the average number of suggestions per company and per&#13;
employee have also increased. Third, on average for this period, 70% of all&#13;
suggestions have been adopted, and the implementation rate has reached 88%.&#13;
It is also reported that the yearly cost of suggestion activities&#13;
was Y 3.77 million on average based on the data of 301 companies, and total&#13;
economic benefits derived from the suggestions was estimated at Y 34.18&#13;
billion.  Therefore, the     e of return of the suggestion system ([benefit -&#13;
cost]/cost) reached 29.1,&#13;
(c) Company-wide quality control (CWQC)&#13;
The most unique system of workers' participation in Japanese compa-&#13;
nies is "small group activities."   It is said tqo more than ten million&#13;
workers are involved in small group activities. -     This figures implies that&#13;
almost one fifth of all Japanese workers including all industries organize&#13;
small groups spontaneouly in their workshop. These small group activities are&#13;
formed on the basis of the Japanese management system and group-oriented&#13;
cultural background, and support the vitality of the companies and Japan's&#13;
economic development.&#13;
Although there are various types of small groups such as recreation&#13;
circles, safety circles, suggestion circles, ZD (Zero defects) circles and JK&#13;
(JISHU KANRI, voluntary control) circles, etc., we will concentrate on QC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
(quality control) circles here, and examine them in relation to CWQC. Quality&#13;
control was originally one of the management techniques imported from the&#13;
United States after World War II. However, under the leadership of the Union&#13;
of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE), quality control activities have&#13;
developed into a unique system in Japanese companies, and nowadays the&#13;
techniques of Japanese quality control are exported worldwide including the&#13;
United States, China, Korea, etc. Quality control activities have played one&#13;
of the most important roles in Japan's export promotion.&#13;
Ishikawa, one of the mosc famous experts of quality control,&#13;
mentions the following six points as the unique characteristics of Japanese&#13;
quality control: CWQC, education and training for quality control, quality&#13;
control circle, nationwide promotion activities 16 valuation system of quality&#13;
control, and utilization of statistical skills.6      We will briefly examine&#13;
the first three points in the following.&#13;
CWQC means at least the following three points.371 First, everybody&#13;
in a company participates in quality control activities. Second, every&#13;
department of the company must participate in the quality control. Quality&#13;
control can be applied not only for the production line, but also any other&#13;
department such as planning, sales, personnel management, etc. Sectionalism&#13;
among departments must be removed. Third, CWQC aims at total quality control&#13;
of all company activities. It controls not only quality of goods, but also&#13;
quality of prices, time, and services, etc.&#13;
It is said that quality control starts and ends with education, and&#13;
everyone in a company must be educated in CWCQ. This is partly because&#13;
quality control is based on statistical analysis of data, and requires that&#13;
everyone has a basic knowledge of statistics. However, a more important&#13;
reason for education and training is that quality control is one of the&#13;
management philosophies to change the quality of the company itself, and&#13;
therefore, systematic and repeated education is essential to understand and&#13;
implement this new philosophy. These education and training programs are&#13;
mainly conducted by the JUSE. Its "basic course" has been held more than&#13;
sixty times since it was started in 1949. Duration of the course is six&#13;
months, and in each month there are five days of lectures and case study.&#13;
Every attendant is required to collect data from his own plant every month,&#13;
and solve problems by learning basic skills of quality control. Graduates of&#13;
the course organize a QC program in their own company based on JUSE's program&#13;
with the assistance of external consult g0sp and disseminate the knowledge and&#13;
skills to other members of the company._&#13;
According to the Fundamentals of Quality Control Circles edited by&#13;
the JUSE, a QC circle is defined as "a small group which carries on conti-&#13;
nuously as a part of company-wide quality control activities, self development&#13;
and mutual development, control and improvement within the workshop, utilizing&#13;
quality control techniques with all members participating." Aims of QC circle&#13;
activities are to contribute to the development and improvement of companies,&#13;
to create better workshops based on humanism, and to realize the full poten-&#13;
tial of employees through the development of their ability. As shown in this&#13;
definition, a QC circle is a small group organized by the spontaneous partic-&#13;
ipation of all workers in a workshop. As shown in Table III-16, the number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
QC circles registered in JUSE reached 115,254 and the number of participants&#13;
is more than one million in 1980. It is estimated that the number of unregis-&#13;
tered circles is almost ten times that of registered circles.&#13;

It is remarkable that such a great number of workers are spontaneously forming&#13;
QC circles. This is mainly because the QC circle aims at self-development and&#13;
mutual development of workers. Workers participate in the circle not because&#13;
of the direct economic benefit (most of the circles have a meeting before or&#13;
after working hours without any payment), but because they can improve human&#13;
relations in a workshop and get self-fulfillment through their job. QC&#13;
circles give workers a pride in their job, and develop their potential. It is&#13;
said that QC circles bring back the essence of working as a human activity to&#13;
workers who have been alienated in the progress of automation. Although there&#13;
is some criticism that QC circle activitiel9ore another way of exploiting&#13;
workers, this seems to be from a minority.-      As long as small group&#13;
activities such as QC circles are based on workers' spontaneous participation,&#13;
they will develop further.&#13;
Some Effects of Japanese Management Policies&#13;
Lastly, let us briefly examine some effects of these manpower&#13;
management policies in Japan. Apart from economic growth rate and the amount&#13;
of GDP, we can mention the following points.&#13;
First, Japan's rate of unemployment is very low, compared with other&#13;
countries. As indicated in Table III-17, Japan's rate of unemployment was&#13;
only 2.4% in 1982, which is the lowest rate in OECD countries. One of the&#13;
main reasons for this Low rate lies in the internal accumulation type of&#13;
management policies such as life-time employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Second, Japan's labor-management relations are relatively stable&#13;
compared with other countries. Table III-18 indicates the work-days lost in&#13;
labor disputes in selected countries. As shown in the table, the number of&#13;
workdays lost in Japan is the lowest both in total days and days per worker.&#13;
(One thirty second of the number of workdays lost in the U.S.A. and one forty&#13;
fifth of the number in Italy).&#13;

Third, Japanese companies can cope with technological innovations&#13;
without causing serious problems such as unemployment. This is because in&#13;
introducing new technology, Japanese companies can transfer their employees&#13;
from obsolete posts to new posts by giving them training. Since workers'&#13;
employment and wages are secured regardless of their current job, they do not&#13;
object to the introduction of new technology such as industrial robots. On&#13;
the contrary, they often welcome it, because they know that as long as they&#13;
get proper training, they can use this new technology to release them from&#13;
hard physical work. According to the Government's investigation, the&#13;
introduction of mechatronics machines resulted in surplus labor in 31% of&#13;
companies, and reduced working hours per person in 25% of companies. However,&#13;
only 2% of these companies coordinated their employees. In regard to the&#13;
wages of workers who were transfered, 12% of companies i7creased their salary&#13;
and 87% did not change.   Only 1% reduced their salary.-&#13;
Fourth, the quality of Japanese products has become remarkably good,&#13;
and therefore, productivity is increased. Table III-19 shows the data&#13;
presented at the US-Japan semiconductor seminar in 1980. From this table, it&#13;
is obvious that there is a significant difference in quality between Japanese&#13;
and American products. Furthermore, quality control leads to reductions in&#13;
production cost, because it decreases the rate of sub-standard articles&#13;
significantly. The increase in quality and decrease in cost has resulted in&#13;
the strong competitive power of Japanese companies in an international market.&#13;

Fifth, .Japan has achieved a relatively egalitarian income distribu-&#13;
tion, Table III-20 indicates the income distribution in selected countries.&#13;
As shown in this table, the share of the lowest 20X of people in Japan is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
8.7%, which is the highest rate among the selected coun.;ies (and among all&#13;
the other countries for which the data are available),4I and the lowest 40%&#13;
(lowest 20% and second quintile) is also the highest (21.9%). On the other&#13;
hand, the highest 10% of people share only 21.2%, which is the lowest together&#13;
with Sweden and Finland (also among the world), and even the highest 20% share&#13;
the lowest percentage (36.8%). Although the reasons for this egaLitarian&#13;
distribution can be explained by many factors such as institutional reforms&#13;
and tax policies, the Japanese education and wage system are two important&#13;
factors. More than 90% of people go to upper secondary school and the rate of&#13;
attendance at university also reaches more than 30%. Although there is wage&#13;
differential between upper secondary leavers and university graduates, the gap&#13;
is not very big (see Table 1I-20). Furthermore, because of the seniority wage&#13;
system, every worker's salary is gradually increased according to his age.&#13;
These systems prevent workers' income from differentiating, together with&#13;
other institutional mechanisms.&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Lessons from Japan's Experience&#13;
This concluding chapter examines what present developing countries&#13;
can learn from Japan's experience. From the comprehensive range of character-&#13;
istics and specific conditions of Japanese manpower, eight aspects of her&#13;
experience are examined, namely, the historical context, appropriate govern-&#13;
ment leadership, primary education, institutional network, utilization of&#13;
cultural factors, competition and merit system, workers' participation, and&#13;
human oriented management and production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
Historical Context&#13;
Any development is a historical process. Japan's development in the&#13;
Meiji period was based on that of the Tokugawa period, and the post-war period&#13;
on that of the pre-war period. It is difficult to transfer a development&#13;
policy which is based on the specific initial condition of Japan to other&#13;
countries which do not have the same condition.&#13;
For example, when the Meiji government started establishing a new&#13;
school system, Japan already had a long tradition of institutional educa-&#13;
tion. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, there were more than two&#13;
thousand small schools called TERAKOYA, in which children from the non-samurai&#13;
class learned reading, writing and arithmetic. For children from the samurai&#13;
class special schools called HANKO were provided by each feudal clan.    Th&#13;
number of the schools reached 285 in 1871 when the clans were abolished.    /&#13;
Therefore, when the school system started in the Meiji period, most&#13;
Japanese people already had some idea of schools, and understood the impor-&#13;
tance of education. In fact, many of the primary schools were transformed&#13;
from TERAKOYA, and this was one of the reasons why Japan could achieve almost&#13;
universal compulsory education by the end of the Meiji period (Table II-1).&#13;
It is therefore important that a policy be based on each country's&#13;
initial condition. When a new system is transferred, it is more likely to&#13;
succeed by utilizing and transforming a traditional system which people are&#13;
familiar with, rather than by introducing a completely new and strange system.&#13;
Appropriate Government Leadership&#13;
The experience of Japan demonstrates the influence of Government's&#13;
role in development. The Meiji government had a strong leadership role in&#13;
Japanese modernization. However, in the field of education and training, the&#13;
Government developed and encouraged the autonomy of local governments and&#13;
participation of the people, and changed from a centralized plan, which was&#13;
expressed in the Fundamental Code of Education, to a decentralized plan of the&#13;
Ordinance of Education. Since the local governments were given some degree of&#13;
autonomy in education, the central government could transfer most of the&#13;
educational cost to them (Tables II-3 and II-16).&#13;
More recently, the basic method to promote in-company vocational&#13;
training in Japan is to give companies and trainees economic incentives such&#13;
as financial assistance for in-plant public vocational training, and trainee-&#13;
ship loans, and training allowances for the unemployed.&#13;
Primary Education&#13;
Primary education is one of the most important elements in the&#13;
formation of manpower. It is widely reported that primary education has great&#13;
socio-economic effects on development such as increased 4jlbor productivity,&#13;
decreased fertility, and improved health and nutrition.4      Although producing&#13;
selected elites as leaders is necessary for a country's development, it must&#13;
be accompanied by nationwide education. In order to achieve total development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
of a nation (and not just the prosperity of a privileged class), it is essen-&#13;
tial to mobilize all human resources who receive at least primary education.&#13;
Japan had only one university until the rate of attendance at primary school&#13;
reached 65%, some thirty years after the Meiji Restoration, and twenty years&#13;
later, when the rate reached almost 100%, Japan had still only four universi-&#13;
ties (the rate of attendance was about 1%).&#13;
Institutional Network&#13;
The development of human resources requires not only manpower&#13;
planning and policies but also variety and range of institutions to implement&#13;
them, Japan has established various types of institutions on a nationwide&#13;
Level. In regard to higher education institutions, there are 62 technical&#13;
colleges, 532 junior colleges, 457 universities and thousands of special&#13;
training schools (Tables II-6 and II-14), and they produce various types of&#13;
manpower. Some 378 vocational training schools also play important roles to&#13;
meet the demand for skilled manpower in local industries. All of these&#13;
education and training institutions are systematically administered by&#13;
national and local governments.&#13;
Private enterprises also provide education and training institu-&#13;
tions. Large companies build their own education and training centers, and&#13;
small and medium companies provide education and training programs as associa-&#13;
tions. Furthermore, there are many non-government institutions which contri-&#13;
bute to manpower development, the Japan Productivity Center, for instance, is&#13;
organized as a tripartite institution, namely, by labor, management and&#13;
academia, and provides education and training programs to promote productivity&#13;
in Japan.&#13;
This nationwide network of education and training institutions&#13;
enables the formation and utilization of Japanese manpower.&#13;
Utilization of Cultural Factors&#13;
Cultural factors always play an important role in the transfer of&#13;
manpower policies. Policies which are alien to a nation's culture will not&#13;
work in that country, even if they were effective in the original country. On&#13;
the other hand, policies which are suited to a nation's culture will be&#13;
accepted, although possibly needing some adaptation.&#13;
Japan can also offer good examples of this adaptation of trans-&#13;
ferred policies. For instance, when Japanese companies tried to change their&#13;
wage system based on seniority (NENKOKYU), they first introduced the wage&#13;
system based on job classification (SHOKUMUKYU) from European and American&#13;
companies. However, since SHOKUMUKYU did not match the Japanese culture and&#13;
management style, it was eventually transformed into a Japanese style system,&#13;
namely, a wage system based on job capability (SHOKUNOKYU). Japanese&#13;
companies succeded in adapting the merits of the new transferred wage system&#13;
to the traditional way.&#13;
Quality control circles are another example. When the technique of&#13;
quality control was transferred from the United States, it was considered that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
quality control was the duty of specialists. However, Japanese companies&#13;
combined the technique of quality control with the group-oriented culture of&#13;
Japanese workers, and generated a unique system of QC circles. As we examined&#13;
in Chapter III-(3)-(c), these QC circles have become very popular in Japan and&#13;
raised the quality of Japanese products to a high standard in the world.&#13;
Competition and Merit System&#13;
Competition is a driving force in the development of human resources&#13;
in Japan: the system of competition derives potential from every competitor.&#13;
Therefore, it is important to build in the mechanism of competition in man-&#13;
power development such as the education and promotion systems. To promote&#13;
competition, we should especially note the following three points. First,&#13;
every competitor must be given equal opportunities to compete. Fairness is an&#13;
important basis of competition. Second, winners of the competition must be&#13;
given appropriate remuneration. The principal of meritocracy is to guarantee&#13;
the reward for one's merit and efforts. Perverted equality weakens the morale&#13;
of competitors. Third, the result of the competition should not cause great&#13;
differentials between winners and losers. Once the losers feel that they&#13;
cannot catch up with the winners, they lose the will to compete.&#13;
Japan has utilized this competition and merit system very well. As&#13;
we examined in Chapter II-(3), all students in Japan are urged to compete with&#13;
each other in their learning process, and this results in the formation of&#13;
well-educated manpower. Competition is also keen in and among companies. The&#13;
internal promotion system and the SHOKUMUKYU system give employees incentives&#13;
to compete during the whole of their working careers. Since more than 99% of&#13;
Japanese companies are small and medium size companies (Table III-3), competi-&#13;
tion among companies is also keen. We can say that the competition and merit&#13;
system play a crucial role in the formation and utilization of Japanese&#13;
.manpower.&#13;
Workers' Participation&#13;
Another driving force of the development of human resources comes&#13;
from participation. As discussed in Chapter II-(3), workers' spontaneous&#13;
participation and cooperation in production result in remarkable achieve-&#13;
ment. Workers' participation should be promoted in various ways so that their&#13;
potential can be maximized. However, it should be noted that Japan's wide&#13;
range of workers' participation is based on a nationwide high level of&#13;
education. Because workers have a strong background of general education,&#13;
they can voluntarily organize their participation activities such as QC&#13;
circles. However, a country where the general educational level is not so&#13;
high as in Japan may not be able to achieve the same results from workers'&#13;
participation. Therefore, it is important to understand the appropriate level&#13;
and range of workers' participation in each country.&#13;
Human-oriented Management and Production&#13;
Finally, the role of human resources in management and production&#13;
should be examined from Japan's experience. Human resources are not only the&#13;
means of economic development but also the aim of economic development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
Physical resources can be mainly exploited and utilized for production.&#13;
However, human resources are not just a means of production. Workers treated&#13;
like machines will not show high morale, sense of responsibility and sponta-&#13;
neous participation in production. Human resources are more than physical&#13;
resources. They have infinite potential to develop themselves, and Japanese&#13;
management focuses on this point of human resources.&#13;
Therefore, general education is important as well as training.&#13;
Although there is no clear distinction, training usually includes the acquisi-&#13;
tion of specific skills related to one's occupation, and education the devel-&#13;
opment of more general skills. Japanese companies always use the term educa-&#13;
tion (KYOIKU) together with training (KUNREN), such as on-the-job education&#13;
and training, industrial education and training. This is because they are&#13;
concerned about not only the improvement of workers' skills but also the total&#13;
development of their potential.&#13;
Japan's human oriented management and production based on a high&#13;
level of school education result in the full utilization of human resources&#13;
and economic development.&#13;

See H. Dyer, DAI NIPPON, 1905.&#13;
[3] Miyoshi points out the following five reasons why the College succeded in&#13;
producing outstanding manpower: (1) As an environmental condition, there&#13;
was no tradition of industrial education in Japan and the new system was&#13;
accepted without any objection. (2) As a political condition, the Meiji&#13;
Covernment totally supported the College in its finance and administra-&#13;
tion. (3) As a managerial condition, Dyer had an excellent vision and&#13;
plan of the College. (4) As an educational condition, there were many&#13;
talented and cooperative teachers. (5) As a learning condition, students&#13;
were intelligent and industrious. See Miyoshi, 1983, p. 17.&#13;

            The education and training of industrial
            manpower in Japan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper examines the role that
            education and training have played in Japan's
            transformation from a preindustrial agrarian society in the
            late 19th century to one of the leading industrial nations
            some 100 years later. It provides as well as some lessons
            for developing countries. The first part of the paper
            discusses the establishment by the Meiji government of a new
            school system to train the manpower needed to create a
            modern Japan. The Meiji government concentrated first on
            developing higher education to provide the leaders required
            for Japan's process of modernization. The government
            also recognized the need to provide universal primary
            education and was able to achieve this by the end of the
            Meiji period. The emphasis on higher and primary education
            resulted in severe shortages of skilled middle-level
            manpower needed for industrialization. To address this
            problem, the government issued the Ordinance on Industrial
            Schools in 1899, which sought to develop industrial
            education and training at the secondary level. The role of
            companies in the upgrading and utilization of manpower is
            considered in the second part of the paper. The government
            gives strong support to the education and training system in
            Japanese companies through financial assistance and incentives.
