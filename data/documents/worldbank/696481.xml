SECONDARY EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
Education and Economic Growth&#13;
1.1         During the past two decades, Thailand has undergone a rapid&#13;
transformation from a predominantly agriculture-based society to an emerging industrial&#13;
economy oriented towards manufacturing, services and external trade. In the 1980s, the&#13;
emphasis of Government policy switched from import-substitution industrialization&#13;
policies to export-oriented manufacturing. Real GDP grew at almost 11 % annually&#13;
during 1987-93, and even as the economy slowed in 1991-1992, growth remained close&#13;
to 8% p.a. The share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 16% in 1970 to over 27% in&#13;
1993, with most of the increase occurring in the late 1980s. During the 1990s, agriculture&#13;
is expected to continue to fall as a proportion of GDP and manufacturing will continue to&#13;
increase, while becoming more sophisticated and diversified in terms of both technology&#13;
and products. Family ownership and extended family business organizations have given&#13;
way to a variety of corporate entities with organized workforces, modern management&#13;
systems, and increasingly sophisticated technological processes. The Government now&#13;
makes few direct interventions in the market and leaves the leading role in decision-&#13;
making to the private sector. Indeed, official policies actively encourage and support&#13;
private enterprise.&#13;
1.2         Economic policy, and the structure and dynamics of the economy shape&#13;
the nature of employment demand, thus playing an important role in determining the&#13;
external and internal efficiency of the education system. The combination of sound&#13;
macro-economic policies and favorable external circumstances has led to rapid changes in&#13;
the economy of Thailand, with significant implications for future employment and for&#13;
education policy. Rapid economic development has brought about an increasing demand&#13;
for well-trained workers, technicians, and engineers in all fields. Fueled by private sector&#13;
expansion, jobs are being restructured to accommodate new technologies, and there is a&#13;
growing demand for employees with higher level skills. This has become particularly&#13;
critical in the manufacturing sector where employment has grown steadily over the past&#13;
decade and where rapid expansion is expected to continue.&#13;
1.3         To maintain strong momentum in its development, Thailand must address&#13;
the emerging human-resource constraint. This takes the form of shortages of scientific&#13;
and technical skills at all levels and inadequate enrollment in secondary education. The&#13;
latter has resulted in a poorly educated workforce (over 80% of Thai workers have only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
primary education or less) which reduces the trainability of workers and retards&#13;
productivity growth.  Secondary education plays a pivotal role in both the education&#13;
system and the economy through providing qualified inputs to higher education and&#13;
educated entrants to the workforce.   Consequently, the need to expand secondary&#13;
schooling and improve its quality are viewed as high priorities in Thailand. Furthermore,&#13;
the long-term objective of becoming a technologically-advanced industrial country&#13;
stresses the need to place special emphasis on education in the strategic subjects of&#13;
science and mathematics and English.&#13;
The System&#13;
1.4         Thailand's educational system, which is highly developed, can be divided&#13;
into four levels: pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary (Chart 1). A strong&#13;
commitment to equity has led to universal access to primary education, with high&#13;
completion rates, as well as to the establishment of effective nonformal programs to&#13;
increase adult literacy. In preparation for primary education, children enter the pre-&#13;
school level at age 3 or 4 and then continue to primary school which requires 6 years to&#13;
complete. Primary education is compulsory and free to all. Lower secondary education&#13;
has been expanded to provide places for about half of the primary school graduates, and&#13;
in principle there is an upper secondary place for each graduate of lower secondary&#13;
education, half of which are in vocational schools and colleges. During the late 1980s,&#13;
secondary enrollment rates in Thailand remained stagnant at around 30% of the age&#13;
group. This was about half the rates in Malaysia and Indonesia and one-third of those in&#13;
Korea and Taiwan, China. The Government has responded to the problem by extending&#13;
the basic education cycle from 6 to 9 years. By 1997, all grade 6 graduates will enter&#13;
grade 7 (para. 1.19). This policy will result in a corresponding expansion of upper&#13;
secondary enrollments.&#13;
1.5         At the upper secondary level, a student may choose either the academic or&#13;
the vocational stream. Vocational education is a major component of the educational&#13;
system, accounting for about 45% of upper secondary enrollment in 1994. At the end of&#13;
secondary schooling, about 43% of the students take the University Entrance&#13;
Examination which screens entrants to degree programs in conventional public&#13;
universities. Access to these universities has been tightly controlled and present&#13;
enrollments of about 155,000 have remained relatively stable in recent years. Open&#13;
universities have helped accommodate the high growth in tertiary enrollments, enrolling&#13;
about 495,000 students in 1993 or 76% of total tertiary enrollment.&#13;
1.6         Responsibilities for educational administration and planning are shared&#13;
among several central government agencies. Administration of primary, secondary and&#13;
post-secondary (non-university) education, including teacher training, is the&#13;
responsibility of the Ministry of Education (MOE). For supervisory purposes, the MOE&#13;
has grouped the country's 75 provinces into 12 educational regions. At the higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
education level, the Ministry of University Affairs oversees 21 public universities and 27&#13;
private universities and colleges.&#13;
1.7         The Government loosely controls private education which forms an&#13;
important part of the education system and accounts for about 15% of primary, 14% of&#13;
secondary, and 14% of higher education enrollments (Annex 1). Most private schools in&#13;
Thailand are proprietary schools, with a few religiously-affiliated schools. There are two&#13;
categories of private school: those offering general education and those offering&#13;
vocational education. For the general stream, private schools range from kindergarten to&#13;
secondary and their total number was 2,943 in 1993. There were 306 private vocational&#13;
schools in 1993. The MOE also classifies private schools according to their financial&#13;
standing: subsidized and non-subsidized. For private schools with a sound financial&#13;
position, no subsidy is given and MOE does not control the ceiling of school fees.&#13;
Private subsidized schools are of two types: (a) those receiving 60% of the cost per&#13;
student; and (b) those receiving 40% of the cost per student. Fees in subsidized schools&#13;
are controlled by MOE (para. 1. 14).&#13;
B. Secondary Education in Thailand&#13;
Structure&#13;
1.8         Secondary education comprises public and private schools, public and&#13;
private vocational colleges, non-formal education delivery systems, and extended primary&#13;
schools offering lower secondary classes in rural areas. All of these schools are&#13;
administered independently of each other and serve different target groups. Within this&#13;
structure, the majority of the public secondary school network is administered by the&#13;
Department of General Education (DGE) of MOE. Secondary education is divided into&#13;
two levels - lower secondary and upper secondary - each of three years' duration.&#13;
Administration&#13;
1.9         Within the MOE, secondary education is managed by several departments&#13;
(Chart 2). Among them, DGE is the largest provider of both lower and upper secondary&#13;
education, managing 2,144 schools, of which 623 offer lower secondary education, 1,513&#13;
lower and upper secondary education, and 8 offer only upper secondary education. These&#13;
schools enrolled approximately 2 million students or about 66% of the total secondary&#13;
enrollment in 1994. With the new initiative to offer lower secondary classes in selected&#13;
primary schools (4,300 out of 30,000 primary schools), the Office of the National&#13;
Primary Education Commission (ONPEC) has become directly involved in secondary&#13;
education. Both DGE and ONPEC have established provincial centers to coordinate&#13;
school-related activities such as planning and implementation of DGE's and ONPEC's&#13;
policies, preparation of budgetary proposals, general administration, training and&#13;
supervision, and monitoring and evaluation of school performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.10         Decentralization is more advanced in primary than in secondary education.&#13;
The provincial and district-level offices of the ONPEC have full authority to manage&#13;
primary schools in their geographical areas. With respect to secondary education,&#13;
however, the director of the Provincial General Education Office's main autonomous&#13;
responsibility is to select and hire teachers. The director also has control over contracts&#13;
not exceeding about $600,000 equivalent.&#13;
1.11         In addition to DGE and ONPEC, the Department of Vocational Education&#13;
is also responsible for vocational and technical education at the upper secondary and&#13;
post-secondary levels. The Office of the Private Education Commission supervises&#13;
private primary and secondary schools but it does not intervene in the internal&#13;
management of these schools.' The Department of Non-Formal Education is responsible&#13;
for adult education which includes secondary education for out-of-school adults.&#13;
Demonstration schools are under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Rajabhat Institutes&#13;
Council (ORIC -formerly the Teacher Education Department) and individual university&#13;
faculties of education.2&#13;
Finance&#13;
1.12         Public education is supported almost entirely by the central government.&#13;
Fees are levied at the secondary and tertiary levels but cover only a minor proportion of&#13;
recurrent costs. The share of the central government budget allocated for education grew&#13;
from 17% in 1989 to 19.6% in 1993, and over the same period total education&#13;
expenditure (public and private) increased its share of GDP from about 2.7% to 3.6%.&#13;
Between 1964 and 1993, pre-primary and primary education received the largest&#13;
allocation of the education budget (between 51% and 59%). During the same period,&#13;
secondary education ranked second, receiving between 18% and 28% of the total&#13;
education budget and this has been steadily increasing. In 1993, public expenditure by&#13;
level of education was divided as follows: 49% primary (excluding pre-primary), 28%&#13;
secondary, 17% higher and 6% other (including assistance to private schools and&#13;
educational services and support). These proportions are in line with averages for other&#13;
Asian countries.&#13;
1.13         As a percentage of the national budget, general secondary education&#13;
represented 2% in the late 1960's, increased to a peak of 3.4% in 1978, and has remained&#13;
around 3% since then. The trend of vocational secondary education followed the same&#13;
pattern - it was around 4% in 1960s, peaked at above 4% in the late 1970s and has&#13;
remained around 3.6% in the 1980s. When comparing expenditure per student in&#13;
' The Commission monitors and controls the establishment of private schools, and provides periodic school&#13;
inspections. It also ensures access and equity for the poor by keeping the tuition ceiling low. This is done&#13;
through the provision of subsidies - 40% or 60% of the cost per student to those private schools which are&#13;
unable to support themselves.&#13;
2 These are schools established as "research laboratories" for teacher training. They offer classes from&#13;
kindergarten to secondary levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
secondary education with GNP per capita, the lowest share was in 1973 at 9.8%, and the&#13;
highest was in 1983 at 18.4%. The trend of this share began to stabilize after 1984 at an&#13;
average of 17%. About 70% of the secondary education budget is allocated to salaries,&#13;
15% to equipment, land and construction, 12% to school subsidies and 3% to other&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
1.14          A cost sharing policy has been established for all levels of education.&#13;
Tuition fees can be levied under the guidelines set by the Ministry of Finance. To&#13;
provide flexibility, school administrators can adjust the amount of fees to reflect the local&#13;
economic environment but the amount may not exceed B 1,000 for both public lower and&#13;
upper secondary schools. Tuition fees in private schools are also regulated. For private&#13;
non-subsidized schools, the tuition fees may not exceed B3,900 per annum for lower&#13;
secondary and B4,300 per annum for upper secondary.&#13;
Physical Facilities and Equipment.&#13;
1.15          The quality of rural secondary school facilities, particularly those limited&#13;
to the lower cycle, tends to be much lower than in the larger urban schools. They often&#13;
consist of a small permanent building to which the villagers have added temporary&#13;
structures using local materials. Equipment is outdated, especially in the science&#13;
laboratories (where these exist), libraries are poorly equipped and teaching materials are&#13;
inadequate. As a result, it is difficult to attract qualified teachers and to teach the&#13;
curriculum  effectively. Many students from better-off rural families often bypass the&#13;
small schools in their own localities to gain admission to the larger provincial schools,&#13;
which offer both lower and upper secondary levels and higher-quality teaching. Physical&#13;
facilities and equipment for science and language labs in the Rajabhat Institutes (RIs i.e.&#13;
teacher colleges) are also inadequate by the standards of tertiary institutions and require&#13;
upgrading. In the cases of libraries, learning resource centers, computer labs and multi-&#13;
media educational technology, the level of provision and development is uneven across&#13;
institutes but generally unsatisfactory.&#13;
Curriculum&#13;
1.16          The Department of Curriculum and Instruction Development of the MOE&#13;
is responsible for curriculum development and testing at both primary and secondary&#13;
levels. The reform of 1978 introduced the 6-3-3 system and the "diversified" curriculum&#13;
was implemented in all secondary schools. Since then secondary education has been&#13;
vocationalized, starting first with lower secondary and followed by u3per-secondary in&#13;
1981. The main characteristics of the new curriculum are its flexibility, the provision of&#13;
3The curriculum was changed from the traditional style of subject curriculum to the credit system to give&#13;
more flexibility and efficiency to learning. At the lower secondary level, there are 6 credits of elective&#13;
subjects for the first two years and 12 credits for the third year. At the upper secondary level, students can&#13;
choose up to 40 credits out of the required 75 credits.  These elective subjects range from traditional&#13;
academic subjects to vocational subjects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
work experience, and the introduction of pre-vocational and vocational subjects at the&#13;
lower and upper-secondary levels.4 The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science&#13;
and Technology was established in 1971 by MOE to develop science and mathematics&#13;
curricula for secondary schools. The Institute is involved in continuous curriculum&#13;
development activities and related inservice teacher training and preparation of teaching&#13;
materials. The terminal grade examination administered nationally has been abolished,&#13;
and testing and examination are now administered internally by each school. In order to&#13;
promote testing standards, schools are organized into clusters for closer testing&#13;
collaboration.&#13;
1.17         Since Thailand has a local rather than a national assessment system, it is&#13;
difficult to judge with any accuracy the overall level of student achievement in the&#13;
secondary schools. However, the results of a 1983 study on academic achievement&#13;
indicated that current levels of academic achievement were unsatisfactory.5 For example,&#13;
lower secondary students scored below the 50th percentile in most subjects. Upper&#13;
secondary students scored slightly above the average in social studies, rational problem-&#13;
solving ability and Thai language, but had very low test scores in mathematics, science,&#13;
and competence in the search for information. Although this study is dated, there is&#13;
plenty of anecdotal evidence that a wide range of critics (especially academics,&#13;
researchers and employers) view the academic achievement of secondary school students&#13;
as unsatisfactory. This is particularly true of quantitative and communications skills. The&#13;
1983 study found that the main determinants of low quality in Thai secondary schools&#13;
were: (a) the lack of qualified teachers; (b) weak curriculum; (c) inadequate supply of&#13;
textbooks and other educational materials; and (d) the poor state of the infrastructure&#13;
(buildings and laboratories). If as seems probable, there has been little improvement in&#13;
student achievement over the past decade, these determinants of low quality still prevail&#13;
and they provide a sure guide to the Government in identifying areas for quality&#13;
improvement.&#13;
1.18         The problems facing mathematics and science teaching in Thailand are&#13;
common to many countries. The low level of student achievement in these subjects in the&#13;
secondary schools is attributable to weaknesses in the primary schools. In particular,&#13;
primary school teachers are generalists and are said to be less comfortable teaching these&#13;
subjects. Thus the lack of a firm foundation in science and math is carried upward into&#13;
the secondary schools.  Attention clearly needs to be given to strengthening the&#13;
foundations of science and math in the primary grades but similar emphasis should also&#13;
be given to quality improvement in the secondary cycle.  It has been reported that in&#13;
Thailand, poor teaching of science and math and the perceived difficulty of the subjects&#13;
themselves, make them unappealing to students.  However, this is not borne out by&#13;
enrollment statistics.  In 1994, 57% of upper secondary students were enrolled in the&#13;
4At the lower secondary level, students may take up to 10 credits in work experience and vocational&#13;
subjects during the first two years and 12 credits during the third year. At the upper-secondary level, up to&#13;
52 credits in these subjects from the total credit requirement of 75 are permitted.&#13;

science/math elective and slightly more than half of these were girls. The satisfactory&#13;
enrollment level for girls may be the result, in part at least, of the relatively high&#13;
proportion of female science/math teachers which represent 55% of the total teachers in&#13;
these subjects.&#13;
Access and Equity&#13;
1.19        In 1994, total secondary enrollment was about 3,430,000 (Annex 1, Chart&#13;
3). The vocational colleges accounted for about 45 of total upper secondary enrollment&#13;
(Chart 4). About 26% of those graduating from these colleges at the certificate level join&#13;
the labor force. In the "comprehensive" secondary schools,6 about 19% of the graduates&#13;
enter the labor market. Thus the majority of graduates proceed to further education.&#13;
During the 1980s, lack of development in secondary education resulted in a stagnant&#13;
gross enrollment ratio of around 30%. This was the lowest among ASEAN countries&#13;
and represented only about half of Korea's rate, when the per capita GDP in Korea was at&#13;
Thailand's current level. Lack of investment in secondary education led to an under-&#13;
educated workforce such that by 1990, 83% of workers had finished only primary&#13;
education or less. This problem has been recognized by the Government and appropriate&#13;
policies are being implemented (Annex 2). Compulsory education is being extended&#13;
from six to nine years to cover the lower secondary cycle. The transition rate from&#13;
primary to secondary, which was 86% in 1994, is planned to reach 100% by 1997. This&#13;
represents remarkable progress since the transition rate was only 52% in 1990. This has&#13;
been achieved through accelerated investment in school facilities, including the&#13;
conversion of excess primary school capacity which has become available due to&#13;
declining primary enrollments (following birth rate reductions). Under this program,&#13;
about 4,300 primary schools will be expanded to teach the lower secondary grades 7-9.&#13;
Capacity expansion has been accompanied by expanded inservice teacher training&#13;
programs which include a three-year program to upgrade 45,000 primary teachers to&#13;
lower secondary status. The result has been a substantial increase in the gross enrollment&#13;
ratio in the secondary schools, which had reached 47% by 1992.&#13;
1.20.        Secondary education in Thailand suffers from disparities in access that&#13;
are common to many countries. Parents' occupational status, which strongly reflects&#13;
educational level, is a major determinant of enrollment in secondary education. In 1985&#13;
for example, nearly 96% of the secondary-age children of professionals were enrolled&#13;
compared with less than 15% of the children of farmers.7 Marked regional disparities in&#13;
access were also evident. The transition rate from primary to secondary in 1985 was&#13;
about 37% for Thailand as a whole but for the Bangkok metropolitan region it was nearly&#13;
99%. Only 2 (out of 12) non-metropolitan regions had rates above 60%.  Although&#13;
recent data on transition rates by region are not available, it is clear that given the rapidly&#13;
6 These schools were academically-oriented prior to 1978. They are now more vocationalized to improve&#13;
the employment opportunities of graduates.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
expanding transition rate for the country as a whole (para. 1.19), disparities in access to&#13;
secondary education are rapidly diminishing.&#13;
1.21        The Government is concerned about the equity issue not merely from the&#13;
educational perspective but also for the longer term contribution that expanded secondary&#13;
enrollments will make to improving income distribution. Plans to expand access through&#13;
classroom construction and accelerated teacher training will benefit mainly families in&#13;
rural areas since enrollment rates are already high in Bangkok.   But 77% of the&#13;
population in Thailand is rural and the direct and opportunity costs of secondary&#13;
schooling are a substantial burden on many families. Thus the Government's expansion&#13;
plans for secondary education include subsidies to reduce the direct costs of schooling,&#13;
which cover textbooks, school uniforms and dormitories. To provide further financial&#13;
assistance, the Government has recently introduced a B 10 billion loan program for lower&#13;
income families. The interest rate is 3% and repayments will be made through an&#13;
additional income tax which is deferred until the borrower has obtained employment.&#13;
The expansion of enrollments in rural schools would also be pursued through greater&#13;
flexibility in class schedules and curriculum in order to fit schooling more closely to the&#13;
rural environment.&#13;
Teachers&#13;
1.22        Availability.  In 1994 there were 108,130 teachers (56% female) in the&#13;
public secondary schools of whom 5.3% held a master's degree or higher and 88.2% had&#13;
a bachelor's degree.  The overall student/staff ratio in secondary education, which is&#13;
relatively generous by Asian standards, is increasing steadily as a result of the rapid&#13;
expansion in secondary enrollments in recent years - from 17:1 in 1990 to 21:1 in 1994.&#13;
This trend is likely to continue as enrollment increases outstrip teacher recruitment levels.&#13;
In 1994, employment of secondary teachers increased by nearly 4% while enrollments&#13;
expanded by around 11 %. The problem is more acute in the critical subjects of science,&#13;
math and English where the stock of teachers is increasing at about 4% and enrollments&#13;
at 14% per year.  In 1993, the entire RI system produced only 240 graduate science&#13;
teachers and 478 math teachers.   While additional graduates are supplied by the&#13;
university faculties of education, this would not have much impact on the teacher&#13;
shortage which has been estimated by DGE and ONPEC to be 7,160 in mathematics and&#13;
5,230 in science.&#13;
1.23        Teacher Training in the Rajabhat Institutes.   Teacher training is&#13;
offered at the bachelor's degree, associate degree and diploma levels in the 36 Rajabhat&#13;
Institutes.   Secondary teachers require the four-year bachelor's degree to secure a&#13;
teaching post. In recent years, the RIs have begun to diversify their programs in order to&#13;
increase regional access to higher education. In addition to teacher education, a range of&#13;
vocationally-oriented programs, such as applied science and technology, management,&#13;
social development, agriculture, arts and journalism, is now offered. In 1994, the RIs had&#13;
total enrollments of about 270,000, of which 121,500 (45%) were in education. The RIs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
are under the control of the Rajabhat Institutes Council (RIC) which is responsible for&#13;
overall policy, planning, budgeting, academic standards, etc. The Office of the RIC is&#13;
responsible for the administration of the system.  Each RI has a rector, a Governing&#13;
Committee and an Academic Council to handle academic affairs. For the purposes of&#13;
student selection and admissions, the 36 RIs are grouped into 8 United Colleges which&#13;
provide a regional focus aimed at encouraging graduates to pursue careers in their home&#13;
provinces. The RIs retain strong community orientation as reflected in their objectives&#13;
which, in addition to training and retraining teachers, cover the provision of educational&#13;
services to local areas, research and technical services, and technology development and&#13;
transfer.&#13;
1.24        Although the RI's have evolved from teachers colleges into broader-based&#13;
community colleges, education programs still represent the core activity. For secondary&#13;
teachers, the B.Ed. degree is the basic qualification. This requires completing at least&#13;
130 credit hours in three broad areas: compulsory general education (40 credit hours)&#13;
which includes courses in mathematics, science and English; a major subject (80 credit&#13;
hours or more); and an elective (10 credit hours). This structure seems to be sufficient for&#13;
the preparation of secondary school teachers in general, but it may not address adequately&#13;
the problem of increasing shortages of math and science teachers. A trainee teacher&#13;
taking these subjects as a major would complete at least 80 credit hours in addition to&#13;
basic courses in the subjects taken as part of the compulsory program. This appears to be&#13;
adequate preparation, at least in quantitative terms. But there remains the need to develop&#13;
appropriate incentives to encourage more students to study these difficult but crucial&#13;
subjects in the schools and then to encourage them to train as math, science and language&#13;
teachers. This problem is reflected in the first choice of applicants for admission to the&#13;
Mls in 1995 - a little less than 20% of applicants selected math or science (physics,&#13;
chemistry and biology). Some attention is being given to these issues (para. 1.27).&#13;
1.25        The quality of teacher preparation is also an issue within the RIs. While&#13;
standards vary significantly among the RMs, there is an urgent need to upgrade their&#13;
academic and physical endowments. Staff qualifications are inadequate with only 4% of&#13;
academic staff having doctorates and a further 30% having masters. Many of these&#13;
degrees are outdated and, therefore, upgrading of college staff is vital to quality&#13;
improvement. The increasing role of the RMs in the provision of research and educational&#13;
services to the community, will also require greater numbers of academic staff with&#13;
graduate degrees.  Science laboratories and workshops have suffered from a lack of&#13;
investment in facilities in recent years.  Laboratory space needs to be expanded and&#13;
workshops renovated in a number of RIs.   Equipment provision also needs to be&#13;
expanded and modernized.   A combination of investments in staff upgrading and&#13;
physical improvements would provide a basic quality-enhancing package for the RMs.&#13;
While aimed at raising the quality of preservice teacher trainees, the measures would also&#13;
strengthen the inservice training of serving teachers. The RMs have an important role to&#13;
play in the provision of inservice training and this includes training for about 4,700&#13;
science and math teachers per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Government's Policies and Plans&#13;
1.26         The Government is giving a high priority to the expansion of secondary&#13;
education in response to its relative neglect in the past and this is reflected in substantial&#13;
recent increases in the budget for DGE, which averaged 22% p.a. during 1990-94. This&#13;
priority also reflects recognition of the crucial role secondary education plays in&#13;
improving the quality of the workforce and in providing the basis for an expansion of&#13;
higher education.  As noted above, policies are being implemented for the rapid&#13;
expansion of lower secondary education (para. 1.19), which will lead in due course to&#13;
similar growth in the upper secondary cycle. However, rapidly expanding enrollments&#13;
usually face the problem of maintaining quality. Here, the Government is pursuing a&#13;
range of actions. There is a clear recognition that the key to quality lies in the preparation&#13;
of well-trained teachers. Thus the teacher college system is being upgraded through&#13;
raising the qualifications of academic staff, strengthening curricula and upgrading&#13;
laboratories, workshops and libraries. This program is underway in 19 RI campuses and&#13;
the proposed project is supporting it in the remaining 17 campuses.  Inservice teacher&#13;
training is also being expanded and improved to raise the competencies of serving&#13;
teachers whose qualifications need updating. To complement the perfornance of better-&#13;
trained teachers, attention is being given to ensuring that teaching facilities are well-&#13;
equipped and there are adequate supplies of learning materials available.  Ongoing&#13;
efforts to review curricula are being reinforced by the authorization of private publishers&#13;
to produce textbooks thus expanding the variety of materials available in the classroom.&#13;
1.27      The second major priority is the strengthening of education in math, science&#13;
and English. These are regarded as key subjects within the education system which aims&#13;
to create a scientifically literate population to serve as the basis for Thailand to develop&#13;
into a technologically-advanced industrial country. The quality of education in these&#13;
subjects is low due to the lack of qualified teachers and poorly equipped facilities. The&#13;
Government is attempting to address these issues along the lines noted in the previous&#13;
paragraph. In addition, a provincial network of specialized science (including math) and&#13;
English language centers is being established to provide high-quality education in these&#13;
subjects to selected students. Special scholarships will also be available in each center&#13;
for students showing particular merit. However, there remain two major issues. First,&#13;
there is the need to encourage more students to study these difficult subjects. Interest in&#13;
science, math and foreign languages must be inculcated in students in the primary schools&#13;
and appropriate measures taken to retain their interest in the higher grades and ultimately&#13;
to encourage sufficient numbers to enter teaching.  In 1994, a special program was&#13;
inaugurated in DGE which provided funds (US$0.8 million) to promote science and math&#13;
in the schools. Second, there is the need for the Government to develop measures to&#13;
retain the services of teachers whose expertise is in great demand in the rapidly growing&#13;
private sector and at salaries substantially above Government rates. Much more needs to&#13;
be done to address this problem.&#13;

II. THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. Bank's Experience in Education&#13;
2.1          The Bank has assisted the development of Thailand's education system&#13;
under six loans/credits during the period 1966-82. Bank lending amounted to US$154&#13;
million or about 35% of total project costs of US$453 million. The overall direction of&#13;
Bank lending under the six projects was consistent with education policy as it evolved&#13;
under the first five national plans (1962-86). The first two projects focused on increasing&#13;
the supply of technical manpower for industry and agriculture. Later projects had a&#13;
broader educational focus and were consistent with the major educational reforms,&#13;
introduced in 1978, which aimed at equality of educational opportunity, curriculum&#13;
reform and improved management of the education system. Consequently, the later&#13;
projects focused on the expansion of educational capacity in the rural areas, the&#13;
introduction of diversified secondary curricula and the strengthening of education&#13;
management.8&#13;
2.2          The first education project in Thailand (Ln. 471-TH) supported quality&#13;
improvement and expansion of outputs in selected vocational institutions. The project&#13;
financed construction, renovation and equipment for 24 trade, industrial and agricultural&#13;
schools and an agricultural teacher training college. The project also included technical&#13;
assistance for curriculum development and for upgrading teacher training. The PPAR for&#13;
the project (Report No. 770, June 13, 1975) concluded that the project was implemented&#13;
successfully. In general, overall enrollment and output targets were met and new well-&#13;
balanced curricula were introduced. The technical assistance program was completed&#13;
successfully and this was due, in part, to close cooperation between overseas advisers and&#13;
local counterparts. Equipment procurement was delayed initially due to the late arrival of&#13;
advisers and this delay was exacerbated by cumbersome procurement procedures. These&#13;
problems were largely responsible for the project being completed four years behind&#13;
schedule. Some items of equipment were judged to be too sophisticated for the schools&#13;
and, in the case of some agricultural equipment, not relevant to local conditions. Some&#13;
difficulty was experienced in retaining teachers with practical industry-related experience&#13;
because of the demand for such skills in the labor market.&#13;
2.3          The second education project (Ln. 822-TH) assisted in upgrading&#13;
education and research in agriculture and related fields in Kasetsart (Agricultural)&#13;
University and also assisted its move to a new rural campus. The project financed site&#13;
development, construction, furniture and equipment, and technical assistance for&#13;
curriculum development, university management and project unit support. The PPAR for&#13;
the project (Report No. 4563, June 17, 1983) concluded that the major objectives of the&#13;
project were achieved although project completion was nearly three years behind&#13;
' For a detailed review of Bank assistance to Thailand under the six projects, see: ducational&#13;
Development in Thailand: The Role of World Bank Lending, (Report No. 7306, June 24, 1988).&#13;

schedule. The latter was caused partly by an unrealistic implementation schedule and also&#13;
by design and construction delays in the civil works component. Targets for new student&#13;
places were met. Equipment procurement was fully satisfactory and the technical&#13;
assistance program was also implemented effectively. Regarding the latter, there was&#13;
close cooperation between advisers and local counterparts. The fellowship program&#13;
resulted in a substantial increase in faculty with graduate degrees. One weakness in&#13;
project implementation was that insufficient attention was paid to educational aspects of&#13;
the project institution such as changes in admissions, enrollments, graduates and the&#13;
employment experience of the latter. Thus there was only limited understanding of the&#13;
educational impact of the project.&#13;
2.4         The third education project (Cr. 369-TH) marked a shift in emphasis away&#13;
from the narrower focus of meeting technical manpower requirements towards improving&#13;
educational opportunities, especially in the provinces. The third project aimed to extend&#13;
and improve elementary teacher training facilities in the provinces, introduce a diversified&#13;
curriculum in rural secondary schools, improve educational research and curriculum&#13;
design and extend science programs and assist long range planning in the Prince of&#13;
Songkla University in the south of Thailand. The project financed construction, furniture&#13;
and equipment for selected primary teachers' training colleges, rural high schools, a&#13;
National Curriculum Development Center (NCDC) and the Prince of Songkla University.&#13;
Expert services and fellowships were included under the project's technical assistance&#13;
program. The PPAR for the project (Report No. 4574, June 27, 1983), concluded that the&#13;
project's objectives were met, with the exception of the teacher training component. The&#13;
diversified curricula for the rural secondary schools were introduced successfully, the&#13;
NCDC was operating effectively (although it could benefit from a sharpening of the focus&#13;
of its research function), the university science programs were improved and their&#13;
quantitative targets virtually achieved. Expansion of rural teacher training opportunities&#13;
was achieved but not to the extent envisaged.  Initially, there was a substantial&#13;
underestimation in teacher supply and the Government reduced teachers' college intakes&#13;
because of the emerging over-supply. Thus project-assisted colleges were underutilized.&#13;
This situation was identified soon after appraisal and project design should have been&#13;
rectified accordingly. The technical assistance program was generally successful but&#13;
there was a need to monitor fellows on their return to ensure that they entered positions&#13;
relevant to their training. There was also a need to observe a realistic mix between short&#13;
study tours and long-term study for higher degrees. The latter may not always be the&#13;
most appropriate method of acquiring skills in certain fields (e.g. curriculum&#13;
development). The project closed 3.5 years behind schedule, due in part to problems in&#13;
the functioning of the project implementation unit, which lacked clearly-defined&#13;
jurisdiction and authority.&#13;
2.5         The fourth education project (Ln. 1271-TH) continued support for the&#13;
expansion of diversified secondary education in the provinces and assisted in the&#13;
establishment of a national adult education system. The project financed construction,&#13;
furniture, equipment and technical assistance for 50 diversified secondary schools and for&#13;
four regional and 24 provincial adult education centers. The project completion report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
(PCR) for the project (Report No. 5710, June 14, 1985) concluded that the project was a&#13;
success with quantitative targets reached or surpassed. Project implementation was&#13;
facilitated by the establishment of a well-staffed Central Project Unit (CPU), which was&#13;
given the authority to simplify procurement procedures.  The technical assistance&#13;
program was implemented successfully and the individuals who received degree&#13;
fellowships were, in the majority of cases, serving in relevant posts. Some difficulties&#13;
were experienced in the preparation of equipment lists and specifications for the adult&#13;
education component due to a lack of expertise in this area. The project was completed&#13;
just over two years behind schedule due partly to scarcity of counterpart funds and&#13;
shortage of experienced implementation staff in adult education.&#13;
2.6         The fifth education project (Cr. 913-TH) continued support for expanding&#13;
educational opportunities in rural areas and for strengthening management of the&#13;
education system and public administration in general. The project provided for the&#13;
establishment of 12 centralized vocational workshops to serve local secondary schools,&#13;
the upgrading of vocational programs in 42 rural secondary schools, expansion of&#13;
educational radio programs and the creation of inservice management training institutes&#13;
for educational administrators and civil servants. The project was implemented&#13;
successfully and closed on schedule. The PPAR for the project (Report No. 7284, June&#13;
17, 1988) concluded that a strong CPU served successfully as a coordinator and resource&#13;
center for the individual implementing agencies. In general the quantitative targets of the&#13;
project were met. However, lack of thorough analysis of the catchment areas for the&#13;
centralized vocational workshops led to underutilization of some centers. The overseas&#13;
fellowship program was generally successful but there were some initial problems with&#13;
the language competence of fellows and some instances of fellows not being retained in&#13;
the positions for which they had been trained.&#13;
2.7          The sixth education project (Ln. 2178-TH) aimed to extend support for&#13;
increasing educational opportunities in disadvantaged areas to the lower secondary level&#13;
and to strengthen education planning and management.  The project financed the&#13;
upgrading of 480 rural lower secondary schools through the addition of classrooms and&#13;
workshops and the inservice training of about 6,000 teaching and non-teaching staff.&#13;
Technical assistance was provided for fellowships and experts in t&amp;Fe fields of education&#13;
planning and management. A program of eight studies covering key educational issues&#13;
was also included in the project. The project was completed on schedule but over-&#13;
estimation of project costs led to the cancellation of about 42% of the loan amount. The&#13;
PCR for the project (Report No. 8363, February 12, 1990) concluded that while the&#13;
physical aspects of the project were implemented successfully, educational objectives&#13;
were not fully achieved. Enrollments in project schools at project completion were 34%&#13;
below target due to overly optimistic enrollment projections at appraisal and to other&#13;
factors such as high tuition and opportunity costs for students. Transition rates to lower&#13;
secondary education also declined. The local inservice training program was generally&#13;
successful but there were problems in the overseas fellowship component regarding&#13;
deficient language competencies and inadequate academic standards for entry to overseas&#13;
institutions. The planning and management component was the least successful because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
it required significant organizational and policy changes which could not be achieved&#13;
within the scope of a single project but required a sustained high-level policy dialogue&#13;
between the Bank and Government. The program of studies would have benefited from a&#13;
synthesis of their findings and the translation of these into an action plan.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned&#13;
2.8       Some of the lessons drawn from experience under previous education projects&#13;
in Thailand, although implemented mainly in the seventies and early eighties, are still&#13;
relevant to the proposed project.  For example, overseas study programs need to be&#13;
carefully planned especially in relation to the language capabilities of candidates and their&#13;
ability to gain entry to overseas institutions. Careful consideration should also be given to&#13;
the mix of formal degree study and short training programs in relation to the needs for skill&#13;
acquisition. Higher degrees may not necessarily lead to the acquisition of the required skills&#13;
and short training courses may be more appropriate.  A well-staffed central project&#13;
implementation unit with appropriate links to participating institutions is essential to ensure&#13;
successful project implementation. Relevant lessons drawn from Bankwide experience&#13;
include the need for: (a) counterparts to work with expert advisers to ensure that local staff&#13;
gain from inservice training opportunities; (b) adequate O&amp;M funding for equipment to&#13;
ensure its effective utilization; (c) special attention to project management and&#13;
implementation arrangements for inexperienced borrowers; and (d) intensive Bank&#13;
supervision in the early stages of implementation and a proper balance of skills on&#13;
supervision missions. The above lessons have been incorporated in project design.&#13;
C. Bank's Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.9        The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Thailand (Report No.&#13;
13458-TH), which was presented to the Board on September 22, 1994, recognizes that&#13;
Thailand needs selective policy and technical advice and financing.  Hence, Bank&#13;
assistance aims at providing value added in terms of helping to address the most&#13;
important development issues, many of which are cross-sectoral and involve the&#13;
provision of public goods. These key development priorities, on which Bank assistance&#13;
would be focused, are: physical infrastructure provision, human resource development,&#13;
poverty reduction and improvement in income distribution, and natural resource and&#13;
environmental management. The CAS envisaged a lending program of around US$300&#13;
million per year during FY96-98 in these priority areas. It was also indicated in the CAS&#13;
that strong interest on the part of the Government in priority areas such as the social&#13;
sectors could lead to increased lending. With respect to education, this interest has been&#13;
declared by the Government through communications with the Bank, in public&#13;
pronouncements and through the high priority being given to education in the Eighth&#13;
Plan. Consequently, a number of projects were identified which focused on sector&#13;
priorities in education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
2.10         The proposed project would assist in human resource development.&#13;
Thailand's economic success has been built on the expansion of manufactured exports,&#13;
facilitated by substantial foreign direct investment. This export-led growth strategy is&#13;
now under pressure due to rising real wages, and skill shortages, coupled with economic&#13;
liberalization in labor-abundant economies such as China, Vietnam and India. A key&#13;
determinant of Thailand's continued economic success, therefore, will be its ability to&#13;
upgrade products and processes towards greater technological sophistication. Whether&#13;
this can be achieved quickly depends critically upon the availability of skilled and&#13;
educated labor. However, past under-investment in secondary, higher and technical&#13;
education, together with sectoral policy and institutional weaknesses, have meant that&#13;
labor quality constraints have become increasingly serious.&#13;
Education Lending Strategy&#13;
2.11        In recent years, post-primary education in Thailand has been unable to&#13;
meet the demands of a rapidly expanding economy for technical skills and for workers&#13;
with a sound general education. This has retarded productivity growth while skill&#13;
shortages have pushed up wages thereby putting pressure on the country's&#13;
competitiveness. The Government has responded with policies that call for the expansion&#13;
of technical and scientific education to increase the supply of skills at all levels and also&#13;
for the expansion of general secondary education to increase the education level of&#13;
entrants to the workforce and to expand the numbers of potential entrants to higher&#13;
education.  A key concern underlying this expansion is the need to maintain (and&#13;
preferably improve) the quality of education in the face of rapidly expanding enrollments.&#13;
2.12        The Bank made its last loan for education to Thailand in 1982 in support&#13;
of developing lower secondary education (para. 2.7).  This was followed by a&#13;
Government policy of not seeking Bank financing in the social sectors. In 1990-91 the&#13;
Bank prepared an in-depth review of vocational education and a review of key issues in&#13;
education.  These reviews were well-received in Thailand but did not lead to any&#13;
discernible action to implement the policy recommendations contained therein. The&#13;
Bank was in no position to push a policy agenda at that time because it lacked the&#13;
leverage of a lending program in education. However in 1993, recognizing the growing&#13;
inadequacies in the education system, the Government asked the Bank to look at the&#13;
possibilities of restarting lending to education.&#13;
2.13        The education lending strategy is based on the assumption that if the Bank&#13;
is to make a meaningful impact on sector development, the Bank must be engaged for&#13;
the long term. In line with the CAS, this means that the Bank must be in a position to&#13;
offer policy advice and, to be realistic, it should be combined with lending operations if&#13;
the Bank is to have a significant impact on policy improvements. Our lending strategy&#13;
would follow three stages. The first stage would cover the design of initial lending&#13;
operations and would constitute the Bank's re-entry into the sector. Initial lending would&#13;
assist in raising the quality of technical and scientific education in technical institutions&#13;
and public universities and in supporting the expansion of secondary education in three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
strategic subjects - science, mathematics and English. Such assistance would contribute&#13;
to the production of better-trained skilled workers, technicians, engineers and scientists,&#13;
and better-educated outputs from the secondary schools. This would address directly one&#13;
of the critical development problems in Thailand, namely, the severe shortages of&#13;
technically skilled and educated manpower. Thus proposed initial Bank assistance is&#13;
fully consistent with Thailand's development priorities and with the Bank's assistance&#13;
strategy. The strategic thrust outlined above has been refined into five proposed projects -&#13;
Universities Science and Engineering Education, Secondary Education Quality&#13;
Improvement (SEQI) I and II, Technical Education and Vocational Training.9  The main&#13;
focus in the projects is on quality improvement through staff development, modernization&#13;
of laboratories and workshops, curricular upgrading and improved learning materials.&#13;
2.14          The second stage calls for the preparation of a policy-oriented sector study&#13;
to be completed by the Bank in FY97. A number of sound education policies relating to&#13;
system expansion and quality improvement are currently being implemented and the five&#13;
proposed projects would support these policies.   These ongoing policies provide an&#13;
adequate framework for the effective implementation of the projects and for the&#13;
sustainability of their outcomes. With respect to secondary education, current policies&#13;
(paras.1.26-1.27) call for the expansion of lower secondary education accompanied by&#13;
quality improvement through strengthening teacher education and upgrading teaching&#13;
facilities. Special emphasis is being given to improving the quality of teaching in science&#13;
and mathematics.  The design of the proposed project (paras. 3.5-3.13) is clearly&#13;
consistent with these policies.&#13;
2.15          However, in addition to current policies which are pursuing expansion and&#13;
quality improvement, there are a number of more complex policy issues which,&#13;
administratively and politically, are proving difficult to resolve. This difficulty is&#13;
reflected in the fact that the issues are well-known and regularly debated, but reaching a&#13;
consensus aimed at their resolution has eluded policy-makers to date.   The issues&#13;
include: (a) the future role of the RIs as they expand into more general four-year colleges&#13;
providing a range of degree programs. This raises a number of issues relating to control&#13;
and regulation, financing, accreditation, status of academic staff, etc.; (b) as the RIs&#13;
evolve, there will be a need to safeguard the integrity of the teacher education programs&#13;
in the face of competition from other disciplines. This implies the need for a strategy to&#13;
ensure, over the long term, an adequate supply of well-trained secondary teachers; (c)&#13;
incentives to attract and maintain science and math teachers; and (d) a strategy to&#13;
strengthen interest in science and math in the schools, especially for girls, and to maintain&#13;
this interest in higher education to support the expansion of programs in science and&#13;
engineering. The proposed sector study would analyze these issues (and others to be&#13;
9Three projects were originally identified. However, certain components in the SEQI Project and the VTE&#13;
Project were ready for appraisal ahead of other components of the projects. Thus teacher education was&#13;
appraised as SEQI I with the schools component becoming SEQI 11. The higher-level technical education&#13;
component in the VTE Project became the Technical Education Project while the basic skill training&#13;
component became the Vocational Training Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
identified) and propose appropriate solutions.  Terms of reference for the study were&#13;
prepared during appraisal and were agreed with the Government during negotiations.'0&#13;
2.16         The sector review would form the basis of a policy dialogue with the&#13;
Government, which would be monitored during implementation of the ongoing projects.&#13;
Recommendations aimed at addressing major problems would be defined and set out in&#13;
an education sector strategy. This strategy would be prepared by the Government and&#13;
would guide future improvements in education. It would also serve to guide the policy&#13;
content of future projects. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the&#13;
education sector strategy would be available for review by the Bank by March 1997 and&#13;
that progress in the implementation of the strategy would be reviewed in conjunction with&#13;
the Bank by March 1999.  Thus, the third stage of Bank lending would encompass&#13;
follow-up projects which would include policy content drawn from the Government's&#13;
sector strategy. It is expected that follow-up projects would continue to support quality&#13;
improvement in science and technical education. The unmet needs are substantial and&#13;
continued concentration of effort by the Bank would ensure that a meaningful impact&#13;
would be made in these areas.  Project design would emphasize monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of policy improvements.&#13;
2.17         The Bank's strategy aims for long-term involvement in the education&#13;
sector. Through continued policy dialogue and carefully targeted lending operations, the&#13;
Government and the Bank would work towards a cost-effective, well-managed education&#13;
system which would meet the skill needs of an expanding economy and service the&#13;
broader needs of a rapidly modernizing society. The initial projects would provide a way&#13;
for the Bank to re-enter the education sector and to address quickly some obvious needs&#13;
for quality improvement within the context of the existing policy framework.  This&#13;
would be accompanied by a policy dialogue, based on sector work, which would analyze&#13;
major problems and propose solutions.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin of the Project&#13;
3.1          The Government requested the Bank in late 1993 to examine the&#13;
possibility of project assistance to education. In conjunction with the Government, the&#13;
Bank identified a project which would assist in strengthening teacher education in science&#13;
and mathematics and raise the quality of science, math and English education in the&#13;
secondary schools.  Most of the preparation work was completed by the Government&#13;
'° The sector study will: (a) define the broad objectives of the education system; (b) review education&#13;
policies and assess their effectiveness in achieving sector objectives; (c) identify policy problems which are&#13;
not currently being resolved; (d) analyze the reasons (administrative, political, socio-economic, cultural)&#13;
for the lack of resolution; (e) make policy recommendations for major improvements in the education&#13;
system; and (f) formulate a strategy for implementing these recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
according to guidelines formulated by the Bank.  Preparation of the teacher education&#13;
component proceeded at a faster pace that the schools component and, in view of this, it&#13;
was decided to appraise teacher education as a separate project (para. 2.13). The project&#13;
was appraised in May 1995. Project processing was delayed following elections in July&#13;
1995 and the installation of a new Government.&#13;
B. Project Background and Rationale&#13;
3.2           The education sector in Thailand is relatively well-endowed with resources,&#13;
education expenditures accounting for about 3.6% of GNP compared with the average for&#13;
East Asia of around 3%. Thus the Government has requested the Bank's assistance not&#13;
primarily for the resource transfer itself, but to ensure that priority needs are addressed&#13;
through the efficient targeting of resources and that value added is provided through project&#13;
assistance. The proposed project is a response to the request for assistance. The relatively&#13;
underdeveloped state of secondary education in Thailand has resulted in an undereducated&#13;
workforce. This has reduced the trainability of workers and retarded productivity growth.&#13;
These issues have been analyzed in Bank sector studies."1 Recognizing the problem, the&#13;
Government is responding with plans for the expansion and quality improvement of&#13;
secondary education. These plans include increasing access through the introduction of&#13;
lower secondary education in selected primary schools (para. 1.19), quality improvement&#13;
through upgrading teacher training and providing well-equipped teaching facilities, (para.&#13;
1.26) and a strong focus on improving math, science and English curricula as subjects&#13;
which are of strategic importance to Thailand's future (para. 1.27). The proposed project,&#13;
whose design draws on previous sector analyses, provides the opportunity for the Bank to&#13;
support the Government's plans. This would be achieved through direct investments to&#13;
assist in strengthening teacher education in science and mathematics. Such strengthening&#13;
is an important part of the Government's plans for sustaining the quality of education in the&#13;
face of rapid enrollment expansion (para. 1.26). In the long term, the project would help to&#13;
provide better-educated secondary graduates for direct employment in the labor market and&#13;
for entry into higher education. This would have a positive effect on labor productivity and&#13;
help to raise the quality of higher education thereby strengthening Thailand's long-term&#13;
competitiveness in an increasingly technology-intensive industrial environment.&#13;
3.3          The project is consistent with the Government's priority for expanding&#13;
secondary education with special emphasis on the development of science, math and&#13;
foreign language skills.  It is also consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy&#13;
(paras. 2.9-2.10) which identifies human resource development as one of the key priorities.&#13;
Regarding the latter, the CAS emphasizes the vital need to develop technical skills if export&#13;
competitiveness and long-term growth are to be sustained. Such skills are built on a sound&#13;

secondary education especially in science and mathematics. The project is consistent with&#13;
the Bank's education lending strategy in Thailand (paras. 2.11-2.17). This calls for the&#13;
rapid development of initial lending operations to make an early contribution in the crucial&#13;
area of quality improvement while leaving major policy changes to be identified in policy-&#13;
oriented sector work (scheduled for completion in FY97) and incorporated by the&#13;
Government in an education sector strategy (para. 2.16). This strategy would guide future&#13;
improvements in education and also serve as a guide to the policy content of future projects.&#13;
The value-added embodied in the proposed project lies, in part, in its addressing immediate&#13;
investment needs in secondary science and math education thereby helping to alleviate the&#13;
backlog of investments in quality improvement. There is also value added in the Bank,&#13;
working in partnership with MOE, applying its rigorous project preparation techniques to&#13;
identifying quality-improving investments and in packaging them into a coherent project&#13;
design, which can be implemented efficiently. Finally, value would be added through the&#13;
Bank's assistance in identifying needed policy changes and in supporting their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
3.4        The overall objective of the proposed project would be to assist in raising the&#13;
quality of secondary education in science and mathematics through strengthening teacher&#13;
education in these subjects.   Specifically, the project would aim to: (a) raise the&#13;
qualifications of teaching staff in selected Rajabhat Institutes (teacher colleges) and enhance&#13;
their understanding of modem teacher education techniques; (b) reinforce quality&#13;
improvement in the RIs through modernizing science laboratories and workshops with up-&#13;
to-date equipment, expanding laboratory space and refurbishing workshops; (c) expand the&#13;
capacity of the RIs to carry out inservice training of secondary teachers; and (d) enhance the&#13;
Rls capacity to undertake research and provide technical services to the community.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
3.5          The project would comprise: (a) civil works (estimated baseline cost,&#13;
US$26.5 million) to construct new science laboratories and to refurbish workshops; (b)&#13;
equipment (US$67.5 million) to modernize laboratories and workshops; (c) equipment-&#13;
related O&amp;M expenditures (US$5.7 million); (d) an institutional development program&#13;
(US$21.0 million) consisting of fellowships and practical training for teaching staff, and&#13;
inservice training for secondary teachers; (e) a research and technical services program&#13;
(US$10.0 million) which would include research grants and consultants to assist in the&#13;
design of research projects and for new course development; and (e) assistance for project&#13;
management and for the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system (US$0.8&#13;
million).&#13;
Civil Works (US$26.5 million)&#13;
3.6          While the facilities of the 17 RIs are generally well-maintained, a&#13;
substantial proportion of laboratory facilities is obsolete and inadequate to house the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
equipment to be financed under the project. In the past, there has been insufficient capital&#13;
investment in facilities and, as a result, the level of lab provision is generally deficient.&#13;
In addition, facilities are needed to accommodate new programs being introduced in the&#13;
applied sciences and technology and to support the expansion of research activities. The&#13;
project would finance civil works for renovation and new construction at the 17 RIs.&#13;
Specifically, each institute would upgrade two computer laboratories, renovate or replace&#13;
workshops and construct a new four story science block. The civil works program has&#13;
been reviewed and found to be satisfactory. Standard designs and specifications for the&#13;
new science blocks are available and these replicate the buildings already constructed for&#13;
13 non-project RIs. All new facilities would be constructed on existing campuses and no&#13;
land acquisition or resettlement would be required.  The 17 project institutions are&#13;
located in provinces outside the Bangkok metropolitan region.&#13;
Equipment (US$67.5 million)&#13;
3.7         The lack of up-to-date equipment is widespread in science laboratories and&#13;
this is lowering the quality of courses offered. The project would upgrade science&#13;
equipment in all 17 RIs. The enhanced laboratories would provide a more effective&#13;
teaching environment and complement the advanced degrees obtained by academic staff&#13;
under the project.  The equipment would be focused on the core areas of teaching in&#13;
physics, chemistry and biology and also address the needs of recently-introduced courses&#13;
such as environmental science and biotechnology. Specific items of equipment would be&#13;
procured to service the expanding research activities of the RIs. Equipment, including&#13;
computers, would be financed to strengthen the teaching of mathematics. Some&#13;
adjustments would be made to the equipment lists during project implementation in line&#13;
with consultants' recommendations for new course development (para. 3.1 1). Equipment&#13;
lists and specifications would be finalized and equipment packaged for procurement&#13;
under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures with the assistance of a&#13;
procurement specialist.&#13;
Equipment-related O&amp;M (US$5.7 million)&#13;
3.8          Equipment-related O&amp;M expenditures would be financed under the project&#13;
to ensure that the equipment items would receive adequate supplies of consumable&#13;
materials to enhance their effective operation in the laboratories.    Maintenance&#13;
expenditures and the supply of spare parts would also be financed to keep the equipment in&#13;
sound working order.&#13;
Institutional Development ( US$21.0 million)&#13;
3.9         To ensure that both pre-service and inservice training for science and math&#13;
teachers is effectively carried out in the 17 project Rls, the teaching of these subjects at&#13;
RIs would be strengthened through raising the qualifications of academic staff. The&#13;
project would finance local and overseas fellowships for 150 masters and 125 Ph.D.&#13;
programs for RI staff (US$10.9 million).  Selection of fellows for training under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
project would be made in accordance with standard Civil Service Commission (CSC)&#13;
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. On return, fellows are bonded for a period&#13;
equal to twice the length of the fellowship. During negotiations, the Government agreed&#13;
that standard CSC procedures would be applied to the selection of fellows for local and&#13;
overseas training and that returning fellows would be subject to the appropriate bonding&#13;
.requirements.&#13;
3.10        Special in-country training would be designed by ORIC in the form of&#13;
courses and seminars of 5-15 days duration. These seminars would be organized on an&#13;
annual basis over five years and offered to 1,880 RI staff (US$1.6 million). An additional&#13;
group of 850 staff would be selected for short term training overseas (US$6.2 million) to&#13;
expose them to the latest teaching techniques and research topics. Training would be for&#13;
6-8 weeks and take place during the long vacation.  RI staff teaching mathematics,&#13;
science, biology, physics, chemistry and computer science would also be required to&#13;
spend at least ten working days per year visiting secondary schools and advising teachers&#13;
on the usage of modern scientific equipment and teaching methods (US$0.8 million). In&#13;
order to upgrade the competency of existing science and math teachers, each RI would&#13;
be responsible for training 280 teachers each year over a period of four years, bringing&#13;
the total number of science and math teachers trained to 19,040 (US$1.6 million). The&#13;
staff development plan has been reviewed and found to be satisfactory. It is summarized&#13;
in Annex 3.&#13;
Research and Technical Service Projects (US$10.0 million)&#13;
3.11        With modem facilities, better qualified staff and equipment financed by&#13;
the project, the RIs would have much stronger scientific research capabilities.  This&#13;
would permit the RIs to strengthen their teaching programs and make an enhanced&#13;
contribution to assisting local industry and the community. This is in line with the policy&#13;
of diversifying the range of RI activities (para. 1.23).  The project would finance 170&#13;
research projects in the areas of science and math education, industrial technology, health,&#13;
environment and agriculture. Another group of 270 projects in similar fields would be&#13;
financed to improve the capacity of RIs to provide local technical advisory services. The&#13;
Academic Council of the participating RIs, assisted by an expert committee, would be&#13;
responsible for the review, approval, financing and monitoring of research projects. For&#13;
technical services projects, similar functions would be carried out by the Governing&#13;
Committee, assisted by experts as appropriate. The results of all projects would be&#13;
widely disseminated throughout the community.  The project would finance research&#13;
grants to fund the direct costs of the projects, and consultants (77 staffmonths) to advise&#13;
on prioritizing research topics, research design, training in research methodologies and&#13;
experimental approaches, appropriate equipment, etc. The consultants would also review&#13;
existing RI curricula in science and technology and recommend appropriate changes to&#13;
the RIC, and advise on the development of new programs relevant to local needs.&#13;
Generic terms of reference for the consultants have been prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Project Management (US$0.5 million)&#13;
3.12        The project would finance facilities (office refurbishment, computers,&#13;
office machines) for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the ORIC and for the&#13;
Secretariat of the Project Steering Committee in MOE. Two years of consultant services&#13;
to assist in project management and equipment procurement would also be included in&#13;
the project.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.4 million)&#13;
3.13        In order to effectively monitor implementation progress and evaluate&#13;
project outcomes, an appropriate system would be established in each RI and a central&#13;
M&amp;E capability developed in the PIU. Two years of local consultant services would be&#13;
financed to provide technical assistance to set up the system.&#13;
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Costs&#13;
Summary of Costs&#13;
4.1         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$140.2 million equivalent&#13;
(B3,505.2 million), including contingencies. The estimated cost by category of&#13;
expenditures are summarized in Table 4.1. Detailed costs and project expenditures are&#13;
provided in Annex 4.&#13;
Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
4.2         Base costs are estimated at April 1996 prices. The estimates for civil works&#13;
are in line with costs that were incurred, within Thailand, for similar types of construction&#13;
projects. Estimates for the cost of equipment are based on current prices for similar&#13;
imported or locally available items. Costs for local and international consultants are in line&#13;
with recent education and training projects for appropriately qualified experts. Unit costs for&#13;
local training range from about US$70 per trainee for short-term programs to about&#13;
US$7,000 per fellow for Ph.D programs. Overseas fellowships are estimated at about&#13;
US$33,000 per fellow for master's degree programs and about US$67,000 per fellow for&#13;
Ph.D. programs. Overseas training and study tours of various duration are estimated to&#13;
average around US$15,800 per participant.&#13;
4.3         Price contingencies of US$8.7 million (about 7% of baseline costs) were&#13;
calculated for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the following expected&#13;
annual average price increase percentages: foreign cost, 2.4% in FY96 and thereafter and&#13;
local cost, 4.5% p.a. throughout.&#13;

4.4            The foreign exchange component of US$96.2 million (representing 69%&#13;
of total project costs) has been calculated on the basis of the following foreign exchange&#13;
percentages: (a) equipment - 85%; (b) civil works - 40%; (c) in-country training and local&#13;
consultants - 30%; (d) foreign consultants and overseas training - 95%; (e) research grants&#13;
- 20%; and (f) technical service projects - 10%.&#13;

B. Financing&#13;
4.5          The proposed loan of US$81.9 million, to be disbursed over five and a half&#13;
years, would finance 58% of total project cost, net of taxes. The Government would be&#13;
responsible for the remaining 42% or US$58.3 million. The loan would be a fixed rate&#13;
single currency loan payable in 15 years with three years of grace and would carry the&#13;
Bank's standard US dollar fixed rate for 12 years maturity. The loan would finance 82% of&#13;
the total cost of fellowships, 84% for equipment, 70% for training, and 90% for consultants.&#13;

4.6          Wlen fully operational, the project would generate incremental recurrent&#13;
costs for equipment-related consumable materials and O&amp;M estimated at about US$5&#13;
million p.a. This would be spread over 17 institutions thus averaging about US$0.29&#13;
million per institution. Tlhese additional expenditures could be accommodated by the&#13;
institutions without difficulty.&#13;
C. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
4.7           The overall responsibility for project management and implementation&#13;
would lie with MOE. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) would be established to provide&#13;
policy guidance and general oversight of the project and it would carry out similar functions&#13;
for all education projects financed by the Bank and other donors. A Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU) with a staff of six (including a project management adviser) would be&#13;
established and would be responsible for coordinating the implementation of education&#13;
projects financed by the Bank and other donors.  The PCU would also serve as the&#13;
secretariat of the PSC. Detailed implementation of the proposed project would be the&#13;
responsibility of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the Office of the RIC. The&#13;
Director, Policy and Planning Division of the ORIC would be the Director of the PIU and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Project Manager would be in charge of day-to-day implementation activities.  The PIU&#13;
would have a core staff of 15 drawn from ORIC's specialized divisions which would be&#13;
supplemented by other divisional staff, as necessary.  The staff of the PIU would be&#13;
organized into four functional units responsible respectively for procurement, general&#13;
administration/disbursements, training/fellowships and planning/monitoring/evaluation.&#13;
The establishment of the PCU and the PIU and their staffing with key personnel would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness. The Project Manager would be assisted by a Project Operating&#13;
Committee (POC), chaired by the Secretary General of ORIC, which would bring together&#13;
representatives of key ORIC divisions and the participating RIs to provide advice and&#13;
assistance on operational issues. Membership and terms of reference for the PSC. PIU,&#13;
PCU and POC have been agreed and are presented in a Working Paper. An organization&#13;
chart for project management is given in Annex 5. The project implementation schedule is&#13;
given in Annex 6.&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.8         The advanced stage of project preparation would allow implementation to&#13;
commence immediately after loan signing. Project institutions have been identified and&#13;
equipment lists and specifications prepared. Project management authorities have been&#13;
identified and competent staff are available to handle implementation activities.&#13;
Implementation arrangements have been agreed.&#13;
D. Monitoring and Review&#13;
4.9         In view of MOEts lack of recent experience with Bank funded projects,&#13;
above-average supervision coefficients of about 15 staff weeks per year would be&#13;
required in the first 2-3 years of project implementation. The Bank would supervise the&#13;
project three times annually during the first 2-3 years of project implementation. It is&#13;
expected that the remaining years would require two missions each year with a third&#13;
being scheduled only if necessary. Supervision missions would also monitor progress in&#13;
preparing the education sector policy study (paras. 2.14-2.15) and the policy dialogue&#13;
between the Bank and the Government, which would follow from the sector study.&#13;
Overall implementation would be the responsibility of the task manager who would be&#13;
assisted by a project architect to handle civil works and procurement, and an operations&#13;
officer to oversee the implementation of the training and fellowship programs. Annex 7&#13;
presents the Bank's supervision plan for the project.&#13;
4.10        Key performance indicators have been developed and were agreed during&#13;
appraisal. The indicators (Annex 8) would be utilized to monitor project performance&#13;
and to gain some insight into project impact. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
agreed to integrate the indicators into the overall monitoring system and use them&#13;
systematically as part of project supervision. The indicators may be modified and&#13;
adjusted as implementation progresses. During negotiations, the Government also&#13;
provided assurances that, in conjunction with the Bank, it would undertake an annual&#13;
review of project progress on the basis of the agreed monitorable indicators. This review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
would be documented in an annual progress report and would be provided to the Bank for&#13;
review and comments within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year. The third&#13;
annual review would include a detailed assessment of implementation experience to date&#13;
and discussions on the development of future projects.&#13;
E. Procurement 12&#13;
4.11         Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. Civil works, to be&#13;
financed by the Government, would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. Equipment would be grouped to the extent possible into bid packages to&#13;
facilitate bulk procurement. Equipment packages estimated to cost US$200,000 or more&#13;
(estimated value US$60.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of ICB. Procurement&#13;
of equipment under ICB will use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the&#13;
Bank. Equipment packages estimated to cost less than US$200,000 (estimated value&#13;
US$7.2 million) would be awarded on the basis of NCB using procedures acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. Up to an aggregate total of US$4.5 million, small items of equipment with an&#13;
estimated cost of less than US$50,000 per contract may be purchased through national&#13;
shopping,13 procedures allowing for the comparison of quotations from at least three&#13;
eligible suppliers. In comparison of bids for ICB, local manufacturers would be extended&#13;
a margin of domestic preference of 15% of the c.i.f. cost or the actual customs duties,&#13;
whichever is lower. Consultants to assist in developing the research program and for&#13;
project management would be selected in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency". For complex, time-based assignments, contracts would be based&#13;
on the standard form of contract for consultant services issued by the Bank, with&#13;
necessary modifications agreed upon by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract&#13;
documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms acceptable to the Bank&#13;
would be used. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants", as mentioned above, prior Bank review would not be required for (a)&#13;
contracts for the employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent each, or (b) contracts for the employment of individual consultants estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent each. However, said exceptions to prior Bank&#13;
review would not apply to: (a) the terms of reference of such contracts; (b) single source&#13;
selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical nature, as determined by the&#13;
Bank; (d) amendments to contracts for the employment of consulting firms raising the&#13;
contract value to US$100,000 equivalent or more; or (e) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of individual consultants raising the contract value to US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
or more.  Fellowships and candidates for overseas training would be selected in&#13;
accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Bank. The prior review threshold for&#13;
12 The Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995 and&#13;
revised in January 1996 will apply to all goods procured under this Project.&#13;
1 National shopping would be used only for the purchase of goods that are ordinarily available from more&#13;
than one source in the country of the Borrower at competitive prices. See Bank's "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", January 1995, revised January 1996, paras 3.5-3.6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
equipment contracts financed by the Bank, is US$7.5 million, in line with the regional&#13;
guidelines for Thailand. No equipment contract is expected to exceed the threshold&#13;
amount, however the first three contracts of each year of project implementation would&#13;
be reviewed by the Bank. All remaining contracts would be subject to post review.&#13;
Supervision missions would conduct all post reviews. It is planned that about 25% of all&#13;
ICB contracts would be post reviewed.&#13;

F. Disbursements&#13;
4.12        The proposed Bank loan of US$81.9 million would be disbursed on the&#13;
basis of:&#13;
Equipment         US$60.4    100% of foreign expenditures; 100%&#13;
of local expenditures (ex-factory&#13;
cost); 65% of local expenditures for&#13;
other equipment items procured&#13;
locally.&#13;
Training          US$ 7.7      100% of foreign expenditures.&#13;
Fellowships       US$ 9.3      100% of foreign expenditures.&#13;
Consultant services  US$ 4.5   100% of foreign expenditures.&#13;
4.13        Disbursements in respect of contracts for equipment estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$7.5 million equivalent, and for expenditures on training, fellowships and&#13;
consultant services, would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE) certified by&#13;
the Ministry of Education. Documentation would be retained by MOE and available for&#13;
review by the Bank during supervision missions.  Administrative and accounting&#13;
capability in MOE is adequate to support the SOE procedure. Full documentation would&#13;
be required by the Bank for any contract above US$7.5 million equivalent. To the extent&#13;
practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$200,000 or&#13;
more prior to submission to the Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the loan.&#13;
In view of the satisfactory budgetary procedures and financing of Bank-assisted projects&#13;
in Thailand, it was agreed to accept the Government's preference not to establish a special&#13;
account. The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of 5.5 years (Annex&#13;
9) which is one year less than the standard disbursement profile for Thailand (all sectors).&#13;
The shorter period is justified by the strong management and implementation capacity&#13;
built into the project and the Government's commitment to complete the project in five&#13;
years. The completion date of the project would be October 31, 2001 and the closing date&#13;
April 30, 2002.&#13;
G. Accounts, Audits and Reporting&#13;
4.14        The Government would cause the project institutions to maintain project&#13;
accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices.  During negotiations, the&#13;
Government would be asked to give assurances that audited accounts would be sent to the&#13;
Bank within six months of the end of the financial year. Audit reports would include a&#13;
separate opinion for expenditures under SOE procedures. The Government would cause&#13;
each project institution to submit an annual progress report to the Bank and to provide&#13;
implementation status reports for visiting missions. Within six months of the closing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
date, an Implementation Completion Report would be prepared by the Bank in&#13;
cooperation with the Government.&#13;
H. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.15        The project would have no adverse impact on the environment.&#13;
Construction of new facilities would be confined to existing campuses and therefore&#13;
would not entail any new land acquisition.&#13;
I. Impact on Women&#13;
4.16        The project would help to raise the quality of teacher education which&#13;
would result in producing better-trained entrants to a teaching service which is nearly&#13;

J. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.17       The Government has recognized the crucial social and economic importance&#13;
of expanding and improving the quality of secondary education especially in the strategic&#13;
fields of science and mathematics. There is also clear recognition that raising the quality of&#13;
teacher education in these subjects is essential to the achievement of this goal. The project&#13;
is therefore being designed within the context of strong Government commitment to its&#13;
objectives. Thus it is likely that the investments included under the project would be&#13;
implemented successfully and sustained in the longer term. Furthermore, the Government&#13;
has sought Bank assistance on its own initiative because it values the Bank's ability to&#13;
produce projects which are soundly designed and properly focused on sectoral needs. This&#13;
reinforces the view that the project would be efficiently implemented and its benefits&#13;
sustained in the long term. As noted previously (paras. 2.14-2.15), the present education&#13;
policy framework is adequate for the implementation of the proposed project, although&#13;
there are important longer-term policy problems to be addressed. However, these problems&#13;
would not adversely affect sustainability of the proposed project. They will be addressed in&#13;
a sector study and recommendations for their resolution will be implemented in conjunction&#13;
with future projects. The conclusions on sustainability are reinforced further by the high&#13;
priority being given to education in the Eighth Plan.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1         The project would raise the quality of teacher education in the RIs through&#13;
upgrading academic staff in science and mathematics. In the longer run, this would lead to&#13;
the supply of better-prepared science/math-based students for entry to higher education or to&#13;
direct employment and this, in turn, would strengthen the technological base of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
workforce. The project would also improve the capacity of the RIs to support local&#13;
development through undertaking targeted research and technical services projects.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.2         The main risk associated with the project concerns the capacity of MOE to&#13;
implement the project. Staff have not had recent experience in Bank implementation&#13;
procedures and special attention has been given to designing sound implementation&#13;
arrangements. Emphasis will also be given to overall coordination between MOE and the&#13;
project institutions. The risk will be mitigated by the allocation of additional Bank&#13;
resources to project supervision in the early years of implementation and through the annual&#13;
reviews of implementation performance.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1       During negotiations, the Government agreed:&#13;
(a) to the terms of reference for the education sector policy review (para.&#13;
2.15);&#13;
(b) to prepare an education sector strategy for review in conjunction with the&#13;
Bank by March 15, 1997 and to review progress in the implementation&#13;
of the strategy with the Bank by March 15, 1999 (para. 2.16);&#13;
(c) that standard CSC procedures would be applied to the selection fellows&#13;
for overseas training and that returning fellows would be subject to&#13;
standard bonding requirements (para. 3.9);&#13;
(d) that in conjunction with the Bank, the Government would undertake an&#13;
annual review of project progress based on agreed monitorable&#13;
indicators, which had been integrated into the overall monitoring system&#13;
(para. 4.10);&#13;
(e) that the third annual review would include an overall assessment of&#13;
implementation experience to date and also include discussions on the&#13;
development of future projects (para. 4.10);&#13;
(f) that audited accounts of the project, including a separate opinion for&#13;
expenditures under SOE procedures, would be sent to the Bank within&#13;
six months at the end of each financial year (para. 4.14); and&#13;
(g) that implementation status reports would be prepared for presentation to&#13;
visiting Bank supervision missions (para. 4.14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
6.2        The condition of loan effectiveness is that the PCU and PIU would be&#13;
established and staffed with key personnel (para. 4.7).&#13;
6.3        Subject to the above conditions, the project constitutes a suitable basis for a&#13;
fixed rate US dollar single currency Bank loan of US$81.9 million equivalent to Thailand&#13;
for a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace.&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
SECONDARY EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT&#13;
The Government's Program: Three More Years in School&#13;
The distribution of government educational services in Thailand is unequal,&#13;
favoring Bangkok and other urban centers. The NEC cites evidence that the difference in&#13;
secondary level enrollment ratios between urban and rural districts increased between&#13;
1981 (25.2% difference) and 1985 (28.9% difference). In light of evidence suggesting&#13;
t,,,at rural people would send their children to send their children to secondary schools if&#13;
these were located close by, the MOE in 1988 announced its intention to extend universal&#13;
education from 6 to 9 years on a non-compulsory basis. In 1989, the program was&#13;
implemented on trial basis with two pilot projects operated by two MOE departments:&#13;
ONPEC and DGE.&#13;
Project on the Extension of Basic Education to Lower Secondary Level.&#13;
In light of the Cabinet's decision to increase coverage beyond the primary level&#13;
and to encourage rural children to remain in school at the lower secondary grades, DGE&#13;
in 1987 initiated this project with the objective of establishing 718 schools in 38&#13;
economically disadvantaged provinces, and selected rural areas.&#13;
Schools joining the project would establish a centrally located branch to offer&#13;
lower secondary classes to children in surrounding villages. Schools were given limited&#13;
freedom to design their own curriculum. The curriculum was presumably to emphasize&#13;
vocational skills. Students were not required to attend school at the regular hours in order&#13;
to introduce sufficient flexibility to help with farm chores or to travel long distances.&#13;
About 71% of the pilot schools preferred the regular curriculum and several&#13;
schools reverted to the regular curriculum after the first year. A number of direct&#13;
subsidies were also introduced such as loans for textbooks, no uniforms, low-cost&#13;
dormitories and exemption from fees.&#13;
Pilot Project for Expansion of Educational Opportunities&#13;
The rationale for this project, designed and implemented by ONPEC, is&#13;
similar to that above, i.e. to see whether the three-year lower secondary education grades&#13;
can be successfully joined with a primary school. This pilot project had as objectives. a)&#13;
to identify an appropriate curriculum for a nine-year basic cycle; b) to raise the transition&#13;
rate between Grades 6 and 7; and c) to ascertain parents attitudes toward lower secondary&#13;
education particularly in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
(Page 2 of 3)&#13;
A new curriculum was proposed for this pilot program which included&#13;
more vocational courses. Students must attend during regular hours but the school is free&#13;
to adopt a school calendar suitable to local demands.&#13;
The project was to be implemented in 75 provinces starting with 119&#13;
schools in 1990 and increasing to 5,321 schools by 1996 by which time it was estimated&#13;
that about 718,335 students would be enrolled.&#13;
Eligibility for a school to participate in this program was determined on&#13;
the basis of: a) adequate classrooms; b) the school principal and teachers work together as&#13;
a team and for the goals of the project; and c) the local community are interested in&#13;
joining the program.&#13;
Federal subsidy of the program covered all tuition fees, textbooks and&#13;
uniforms for one year. In some locations, a school lunch program was also provided.&#13;
An Evaluation of the ONPEC Project&#13;
An evaluation of the pilot project by the NEC reported that the project was&#13;
successful in increasing coverage at the lower secondary level. The major conclusion&#13;
was that by having a school within walking distance can reduce educational costs for&#13;
families. It was also found that poor planning has, in some instances, resulted in&#13;
misplaced schools. Other major problems identified were:&#13;
I) Many of the teachers were trained to teach primary grades and were not&#13;
prepared to teach lower at the secondary level especially in mathematics, Thai and&#13;
English language and some vocational courses.&#13;
2)  Teaching equipment and instructional materials, particularly for&#13;
science subjects, was lacking.&#13;
3)   Management problems are still present after two years of&#13;
implementation. Some principals and teachers did not understand project goals and&#13;
guidelines. In a few cases, children enrolling in the program were not from poor families.&#13;
Many schools have applied to participate in the project and ONPEC is&#13;
trying to expand the project while maintaining standards and adhering to project&#13;
objectives. The evaluation document, "Three More Years in School" which interviewed&#13;
hundred of village parents, concluded with this summary of villagers'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(Page 3 of 3)&#13;
Grades 7-9 into the local primary school: "Most villagers did not find elementary&#13;
education enough to get a decent job in the formal sector. They realize that the labor&#13;
market is now demanding at least the lower secondary education. Without lower&#13;
secondary education, one can only expect low pay and hard working jobs. A person with&#13;
primary education often cannot find employment, and has to return to work on the farm,&#13;
and sometimes, has become a burden for parents. Parents believe that with lower&#13;
secondary certificate, their children will be smarter, have greater opportunities to get a&#13;
good job, and have a better life. In addition, some villagers said enrollment in lower&#13;
secondary education will ensure that their children are able to continue in the upper&#13;
secondary and higher education levels if they wanted to."'2&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Secondary
            Education Quality Improvement Project will be to assist in
            raising the quality of secondary education in science and
            mathematics through strengthening teacher education in these
            subjects. Specifically, the project aims to: 1) raise the
            qualifications of teaching staff in selected Rajabhat
            Institutes (RIs) (teacher colleges) and enhance their
            understanding of modern teacher education techniques; 2)
            reinforce quality improvement in the RIs through modernizing
            science laboratories and workshops with up-to-date
            equipment, expanding laboratory space and refurbishing
            workshops; 3) expand the capacity of the RIs to carry out
            in-service training of secondary teachers; and 4) enhance
            the RIs capacity to undertake research and provide technical
            services to the community. The project will comprise the
            following components: 1) civil works to construct new
            science laboratories and to refurbish workshops; 2)
            equipment to modernize laboratories and workshops; 3)
            equipment-related operations and maintenance expenditures;
            4) an institutional development program consisting of
            fellowships and practical training for teaching staff, and
            in-service training for secondary teachers; 5) a research
            and technical services program which will include research
            grants and consultants to assist in the design of research
            projects and for new course development; and 6) assistance
            for project management and for the establishment of a
            monitoring and evaluation system.
