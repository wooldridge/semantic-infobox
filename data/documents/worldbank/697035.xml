COMPETITIVENESS ENHANCEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
L   BACKGROUND&#13;
(i)    Country and Sector Profile&#13;
1.    El Salvador's GDP was estimated at US$ 8.1 billion equivalent in 1994, with per capita&#13;
income of US$ 1,450 equivalent. The country has a dynamic private sector, and has the&#13;
reputation of being one of the most entrepreneurial economies in Latin America. With the&#13;
privatization of commercial banks and finance companies, the dismantling of state agricultural&#13;
marketing, and the sale of a sizable share of state-owned productive assets, the private sector now&#13;
accounts for approximately 93 percent of total employment and produces over 90 percent of&#13;
GDP. The economy is predominantly manufacturing and service-oriented, with secondary and&#13;
tertiary production accounting for 65 percent of employment and over 90 percent of output&#13;
(services alone accounts for 41.5 and 66 percent, respectively -- with commerce as the greatest&#13;
contributor to employment and sales). Of its population of roughly 5.6 million people, an&#13;
estimated almost 20 percent currently reside abroad, with about 85 percent of these living in the&#13;
United States.&#13;
2.    After more than a decade of civil war and stagnation (1979-91), GDP growth rebounded&#13;
from 3.5 percent in 1990-91 to 7.4 in 1992-93 and 6.0 in 1994. Inflation has fallen to 8.9 percent&#13;
in 1994, from a high of over 30 percent in 1986. The current account deficit (excluding official&#13;
transfers) fell from 7.0 percent of GDP in 1989 to 5.7 in 1992 and 3.7 in 1994. This impressive&#13;
performance reflects in part the impact of sound macro-economic policies supported by the IMF&#13;
and two World Bank structural adjustment loans approved since 1989.&#13;
(ii)   A Productivity-Based Development Strategv&#13;
3.    Notwithstanding the achievements of the 1989-94 period, at least four considerations have&#13;
led to a reevaluation of the previous development strategy:&#13;
* Per capita GDP in 1994 was still below 1975-79 (pre-war) levels, and poverty appears to have&#13;
remained very high. Sustained high and more equitable growth appears urgent to alleviate&#13;
poverty and ensure continued peace.&#13;
* The recent recovery in economic growth was fueled by growth in the non-tradable sector,&#13;
manifest through a service and construction boom as pent-up wartime demand was unleashed&#13;
and foreign remittances increased (worker remittances have increased faster than any other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
inflow, and in 1994 accounted for 9.7 percent of GDP and 73 percent of national savings).&#13;
Conversely, there has been a decline in exports of goods and non-factor services as a&#13;
percentage of GDP, from roughly 35 percent in the pre-war years to 16 in 1990 and 13.5 in&#13;
1994; though the level of real exports has started to recover from its war-time slump, growth&#13;
has not been spectacular and the economy has a long way to go to reach the export and&#13;
outward orientation levels of the East Asian economies. Slow export growth appears due to a&#13;
combination of three factors: structural factors resulting from the consequence of the civil war&#13;
and remaining constraints to exporters; worsening terms of trade; and real exchange rate&#13;
appreciation. To be sustainable, future economic growth should be based not only on an&#13;
expansion in industrial and agricultural production but also on higher export levels.&#13;
*  To reduce dependence on low-cost labor as the main source of comparative advantage,&#13;
economic growth must be based on continual increases in productivity. The fundamental basis&#13;
for higher productivity growth lies in increased competition (intemal as well as external),&#13;
investments in physical infrastructure, and investments in human capital (in 1993, formal&#13;
education averaged only 5 years).&#13;
*  International economic integration and the globalization of production and investment create&#13;
opportunities for developing countries to increase their share of international production and&#13;
trade, and to become competitive in technologically more advanced products and services. To&#13;
facilitate higher levels of sustainable private-sector-led economic growth, El Salvador needs to&#13;
enhance its outward orientation and deepen participation in the global economy, improve&#13;
attractiveness to foreign investors, strengthen channels of technology diffusion, and put&#13;
technology to use in the productive sectors.&#13;
4.    The Calder6n Sol Administration took office in June 1994 and announced its economic&#13;
program in February 1995. The main stated objective of the program is to achieve more rapid and&#13;
equitable growth by enhancing global competitiveness and entering a new, productivity-oriented&#13;
stage of development. In practice, given the current preponderance of the private sector in&#13;
economic activity coupled with a still weak set of support systems for private enterprises, the aim&#13;
is to create an environment facilitating increased productivity based on lower transactions costs&#13;
and increased dynamism of an export-oriented private sector. In the medium term, the plan aims&#13;
to (i) promote domestic and foreign investment and incorporate the country into the global&#13;
production chain by lowering the costs of operating in the country, and (ii) strengthen the public&#13;
sector's role as a facilitator of private sector development and increase the efficiency of&#13;
infrastructure services through a restructuring and/or privatization of public enterprises.&#13;
5.    To achieve these objectives, the Government has announced actions in four main areas: (i)&#13;
accelerating trade liberalization by gradually reducing the range of tariff rates from 1-20% in 1995&#13;
to 0-6% in 1999; (ii) modernizing the public sector; (iii) strengthening fiscal discipline by&#13;
increasing revenue collection and lowering expenditures; and (iv) establishing a progressive and&#13;
voluntary dollarization of the exchange regime. The Government Development Plan 1994-1999&#13;
(Plan de Gobiemo), to be published in the near future, includes the following provisions to&#13;
improve the enabling environment for private sector development: the strengthening of&#13;
competition (a transparent schedule of tariff liberalization until 1999, the enactment of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
competition law and the reform of the consumer protection law, privatization and the introduction&#13;
of competition in the provision of infrastructure services, modernization of the financial system),&#13;
the need for international promotion of the country (foreign investment, tourism), and the&#13;
generation of a cooperative environment between business leaders and workers for continuous&#13;
productivity upgrading (worker and management training and information dissemination&#13;
initiatives, and more flexible worker compensation schemes tied to productivity).&#13;
6.    As part of its broader development strategy, the Government is aware of the urgency and&#13;
critical importance of upgrading human capital formation. During the last administration, the&#13;
Ministry of Education began to address the problems of the education system by policies aimed at&#13;
reallocating resources to favor basic education, improving the quality of the basic education&#13;
curriculum, and decentralizing services to improve efficiency. Since 1989, the total enrollment&#13;
rate for education grades 1 to 6 already has increased from 76 to 83 percent by 1993. The current&#13;
Government is consolidating, continuing, and expanding the human capital formation efforts of&#13;
the past administration. To this end, the Government has established a National Commission for&#13;
Education, Science and Development (Comisi6n Nacional de Educaci6n, Cienciay Desarrollo)&#13;
with participation of leading academic, business and political figures. The Commission has&#13;
proposed a framework for broad reform of all levels of the educational and scientific system in the&#13;
country. Congruent with the Commission's proposal, the Government is planning a major effort&#13;
to expand access to preschool and basic education, to improve education quality, and to&#13;
modernize and strengthen education management, under a US$ 80.2 million Basic Education&#13;
Modernization Project jointly funded by IBRD and IDB. The Government is also committed to&#13;
improve and develop the framework for technical training and technology upgrading.&#13;
7.    The Government also is aware of the need to direct policies and programs towards&#13;
poverty reduction, and has set the alleviation of poverty as its principal social objective. In March&#13;
1995, President Calder6n Sol announced the Government's social action plan, which aims to&#13;
reduce poverty, promote social development, and improve economic opportunity and social&#13;
mobility for all Salvadorans. The plan calls for progress toward a long-term objective of&#13;
establishing a national network of basic social services that assures access to all the population,&#13;
especially the most vulnerable groups. In addition to human capital formation through education&#13;
and training, it places special emphasis on health and nutrition, the well-being of the poorest&#13;
groups, basic infrastructure, community development and the monitoring of social programs. This&#13;
Competitiveness Enhancement Technical Assistance Project, by helping to create an enabling&#13;
environment for more rapid, outward-oriented growth, indirectly helps alleviate poverty to the&#13;
extent that all incomes increase as productivity rises and costs of intermediate and final goods fall.&#13;
More directly, the project improves equity to the extent that access to the enterprise sector is&#13;
facilitated. As examples, all measures aimed at eliminating unnecessary transactions and&#13;
bureaucratic red tape should reduce costs proportionately more for smaller enterprises, while&#13;
more efficient provision of infrastructure services should improve access not only for enterprises&#13;
but for all consumers. Reform of legal registries, in particular registries for movable assets, are&#13;
critical to widening access to credit for smaller enterprises. Effective enforcement of competition&#13;
law should create a level playing field to the advantage of all enterprises and lower prices for&#13;
consumers, while appropriate enforcement of consumer protection laws should benefit all&#13;
consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
8.    The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for El Salvador discussed by the&#13;
Executive Directors on August 23, 1993, in conjunction with the Second Structural Adjustment&#13;
Loan operation, is to support the Government in meeting its development challenges through a&#13;
blend of adjustment lending, investment lending in selected sectors, analytical work to address&#13;
sectoral issues and guide the policy dialogue, technical assistance to deepen reforms and&#13;
strengthen institutions, and donor coordination. Under SAL II (Loan 3646-SV, FY1994), the&#13;
Government eliminated most remaining trade duty exemptions, rationalized the tax rate structure,&#13;
and reduced distortions in economic incentives. A Public Sector Modernization Loan, which is&#13;
being prepared concurrently with this proposed operation, is intended to support the&#13;
Government's comprehensive medium-term public sector reform program.&#13;
9.    This project addresses the most urgent constraints to private sector development identified&#13;
in a recent Country Economic Memorandum/Private Sector Assessment (CEM/PSA) (El&#13;
Salvador: Meeting the Challenge of Globalization, Report No. 14109-SV, The World Bank,&#13;
1995), in order to help create an enabling environment for increased productivity and higher&#13;
private sector- and export-led growth. As part of the PSA, a survey elicited the judgments of&#13;
entrepreneurs and senior managers of over 200 Salvadoran enterprises regarding obstacles to&#13;
enterprise operation and growth. According to that survey, continued political and policy&#13;
uncertainty were the dominant concerns of enterprises, even in the post-civil war era; the Public&#13;
Information component of this project attempts to address such concerns. Close behind were&#13;
concerns about human resources (to be addressed by the technological capabilities component)&#13;
and infrastructure (by the business environment component). It should be stressed that lack of&#13;
competent, well-trained workers came in first in the initial open-ended question on constraints&#13;
facing enterprises. Additional direct data from enterprises about compliance costs suggests that&#13;
regulatory requirements impose unnecessarily high costs on enterprises.&#13;
HI.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
10.   The proposed Competitiveness Enhancement Technical Assistance Project is intended to&#13;
support the Government's program to accelerate outward-oriented private sector development&#13;
and raise productivity. To start moving toward these desirable long-term objectives, the project&#13;
would facilitate change by providing focused technical assistance to help the Government&#13;
progress toward three main goals, namely: (a) to improve the business environment and lower&#13;
the cost of doing business in El Salvador; (b) to improve the environment for technological&#13;
capabilities of private sector enterprises and labor, in order to raise productivity and international&#13;
competitiveness; and (c) to improve the environment for building consensus on economic&#13;
competitiveness issues, by facilitating the flow of public information and public sector-private&#13;
sector dialogue.&#13;
11.   The economic reforms pursued since 1989 achieved macroeconomic stability and a more&#13;
open trade regime. In the wake of these reforms, however, a large agenda of "second generation"&#13;
reforms -- legal, regulatory, and institutional -- must be designed and adopted in order to create&#13;
an enabling environment for private sector activity which stimulates and fosters productivity&#13;
increases. This project would support two types of activities aimed at facilitating change, at times&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
within the same subcomponent: (i) in a number of areas, new laws or regulations need to be&#13;
prepared, or existing laws and regulations need to be reformed; for those cases, the project would&#13;
help to focus and accelerate policymaking; (ii) in other areas, legal and regulatory reforms have&#13;
been adopted, and what is needed is a strategy and institutional capacity to implement the reforms&#13;
and monitor the results; in these areas, the project would concentrate on institutional reform,&#13;
monitoring, and evaluation.&#13;
IIL PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
12.   The project would consist of three substantive components: (i) a Business Environment&#13;
component with four subcomponents (clusters of activities), to be implemented by the Ministry of&#13;
Economy, Ministry of Coordination of Economic and Social Development (MICDES), Ministry&#13;
of Justice, and the Central Bank; (ii) a Technological Capabilities component with three&#13;
subcomponents, to be implemented by the Ministry of Economy, National Council on Science and&#13;
Technology (CONACYT) and the Salvadoran Institute for Professional Training (INSAFORP);&#13;
and (iii) a Public Information component with two subcomponents, to be implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy and MICDES. A fourth component would strengthen Project&#13;
Administration (paras. 23-26). Project physical and cost contingencies comprise the&#13;
remainder of project financing. Attachment I provides estimated project costs by activity.&#13;
Attachment II (Project Implementation Plan) provides greater detail regarding project objectives,&#13;
activities, outputs, institutional responsibilities, monitoring indicators and timing.&#13;
(i)    Business Environment (US$ 10.5 million, 52.5 % of Droject costs)&#13;
Domestic Competition (USS 1.6 million, 8. 0 % ofproject costs)&#13;
13.   According to the recent CEM/PSA, unfair competition appears to be a serious problem in&#13;
El Salvador. A majority of enterprises reported experiencing informal or illegal competition&#13;
problems, with listed concerns including anti-competitive practices, enterprises selling below cost,&#13;
and avoidance of regulations. Strengthening of competition to ensure that market forces result in&#13;
productivity increases is a critical commitment of the Government. In the Government&#13;
Development Plan 1994-1999, the immediate agenda of actions to be undertaken include&#13;
continued and sharp tariff liberalization, the passing of a competition law before end 1995, and&#13;
reforms to the consumer protection law also before end 1995. The project would support efforts&#13;
to strengthen competition in three areas: competition law; consumer protection law; and a&#13;
framework for enterprise restructuring. The Ministry of Economy is responsible for implementing&#13;
competition and consumer protection activities, and the Ministry of Justice for enterprise&#13;
restructuring activities.&#13;
Competition law and enforcement. The announced liberalization of import tariffs lowers the&#13;
cost of foreign goods entering the country, and thereby should result in sharper competition&#13;
from abroad. However, in the Salvadoran environment, tariff liberalization alone is likely not&#13;
to be sufficient stimulus for competition in local markets given the historical pattems of anti-&#13;
competitive cartel agreements and effective geographic segmentation in many markets,&#13;
especially in non-tradable goods and distribution channels. Article 1 10 of the Constitution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
prohibits monopolistic practices, but there is no complementary law or enforcement of any&#13;
sort against such forms of anti-competitive practices.&#13;
The project would provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Economy to complete&#13;
preparation of a law to promote competition and prevent monopolistic and restrictive&#13;
practices that harm economic efficiency. The project also would assist in setting up an&#13;
environment for effective implementation of the law, including the identification of laws and&#13;
regulatory impediments that could delay implementation and action plans to address such&#13;
obstacles; the preparation of guidelines; public awareness, training and constituency-building&#13;
activities to support implementation; provision of resident advisors and intemships with&#13;
competition agencies in more experienced jurisdictions; enforcement and other operational&#13;
procedures; required office equipment such as data processing, information filing and retrieval&#13;
systems; and safeguards for ensuring business confidentiality. These activities would be&#13;
coordinated closely with the complementary consumer protection and enforcement activities&#13;
(see below).&#13;
* Consumer protection law and enforcement. A consumer protection law was adopted in El&#13;
Salvador in 1992, and revisions to that law were recently passed by the Legislative Assembly&#13;
(July 1995). However, the contents or even the existence of the law is not widely known, and&#13;
enforcement to date has been ineffective. In its immediate agenda, the Government&#13;
Development Plan recognizes the need in El Salvador for consumers to play a stronger role&#13;
through their purchase decisions in exerting pressure on firms to provide higher quality goods&#13;
at competitive prices, and therefore calls for two specific sets of actions regarding consumer&#13;
protection: (i) the strengthening of the Consumer Protection Office; and (ii) further reforms to&#13;
the law, to give more power to the institution responsible to defend consumer interests with&#13;
the specification of penalties for violations, in particular in the area of unfair advertising.&#13;
The project would provide technical assistance to the Ministry of Economy to create&#13;
incentives for more effective enforcement and to study the possibility of further revisions to&#13;
the law, including analysis of the current version of the law and the current institutional design&#13;
of the Consumer Protection Office and attendant enforcement mechanisms; necessary changes&#13;
in complementary laws and regulations would also be identified, together with an action&#13;
program to change them. The project would provide recommendations for desirable changes&#13;
and amendments to the law, and proposals for improved incentives for wider compliance and&#13;
more appropriate and effective enforcement within the country. The project would assist in&#13;
institutional strengthening, including training, information dissemination and constituency-&#13;
building activities, provision of resident advisors, assistance in redesign of enforcement and&#13;
other operational procedures, as well as purchases of required office equipment. These&#13;
activities would be coordinated closely with the complementary competition law and&#13;
enforcement activities (see above).&#13;
* Enterprise restructuring. At present, the available mechanisms for enterprise debt&#13;
restructuring in El Salvador constrain access to credit (particularly by small and medium&#13;
enterprises) and act as a barrier to new entry and more competition. Formal bankruptcy&#13;
proceedings are virtually never undertaken due to: (i) cumbersome and impractical procedural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
requirements; (ii) legal focus on criminal action against debtor rather than rehabilitation and&#13;
orderly distribution of assets in liquidation under bankruptcy law; and (iii) failure of the law to&#13;
provide courts with sufficient guidance on resolution of common transactions. Out-of-court&#13;
workouts are adequate in El Salvador only for large, established firms which maintain&#13;
relationships with only one or two commercial banks. Smaller firms are not well-served by&#13;
the system. The lack of assurance that all creditors will be treated equitably constrains the&#13;
entry of new financial intermediaries and the introduction of new lending instruments, thereby&#13;
enabling the persistence of oligopolistic market practices among existing banks. While large&#13;
firms may be subject to slightly higher lending margins as a result, smaller enterprises are&#13;
proportionally more affected through the resulting lack of financial innovation to serve them&#13;
(e.g., supplier credit) and consequent restraint of credit supply.&#13;
The project would undertake a dual-track approach to improving provisions for enterprise&#13;
restructuring in El Salvador. First, the project would support a focused study to support the&#13;
creation and development of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, along with training&#13;
activities for the legal, corporate, and judicial community to facilitate use of the mechanism.&#13;
In parallel, but with the primary impact accruing in the medium term, the project would&#13;
provide technical assistance to identify current impediments to court bankruptcy proceedings&#13;
and to design a modern bankruptcy law with its attendant regulations. Seminars would be&#13;
held with legal and judicial personnel to help build consensus in the reforms and to provide&#13;
training to facilitate implementation and use of the new provisions.&#13;
Private Provision of Infrastructure Services (US$ 2.5 million, 12.5 % ofproject costs)&#13;
14.   El Salvador cannot fulfill its potential for export-led growth without overhauling and&#13;
modernizing its telecommunications, power and transport networks. In the PSA survey, the three&#13;
leading infrastructure constraints were problems with telecommunications, voltage fluctuations,&#13;
and the state of roads. Almost half of all enterprises interviewed said that problems of&#13;
communication and transportation created difficulties in fulfilling agreements for the timely&#13;
delivery of their products. Roads were especially limiting to those enterprises that export the&#13;
most -- larger and industrial firms. Quite generally, the poor condition of infrastructure saps the&#13;
competitiveness of the private sector. Encouragingly, the Government of El Salvador has explicitly&#13;
recognized the importance of regulatory reform and privatization through several policy initiatives and&#13;
pronouncements. In particular, the Government has acknowledged the importance of rapid&#13;
development of infrastructure as an engine of economic growth. Such development will require a&#13;
substantial increase in the historic levels of private and public investment, which can only be achieved&#13;
through an acceleration of the process of sectoral reform and restructuring. These reforms should seek&#13;
to strengthen the efficiency with which the infrastructure sectors meet users' demands through the&#13;
removal of unnecessary regulatory controls, and through a realignment of the respective roles of the&#13;
public and private sectors. Establishing appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks, efficient price&#13;
levels and structures, and clear pricing mechanisms are fundamental to attracting private investrnent&#13;
capital.&#13;
15.   However, only modest progress has been made to date in the areas of regulatory reform&#13;
and privatization of infrastructure services. This lack of progress can be attributed primarily to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
absence of a coherent plan of action to support policy reform and sector reorganization. It should&#13;
be recognized that successful privatization entails a number of specific complex and interrelated&#13;
activities with an appropriate sequencing. In infrastructure, the transfer of ownership is only one step&#13;
in a long and complex process. The benefits of privatization come from a reliance on market forces,&#13;
and thus the introduction competition in areas where it is feasible. Therefore, the economic analysis of&#13;
appropriate structural options is an important determinant of whether privatization ultimately leads to&#13;
the expected efficiency improvements. Following privatization, the infrastructure sectors will most&#13;
likely contain substantial elements of monopoly in supply, and therefore for an extended period of time&#13;
will entail a mixture of monopoly and competitive elements. In such markets, regulatory issues are&#13;
most complex, and a substantial burden therefore is placed on the regulatory process. Thus, the&#13;
establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework is an indispensable precondition for successful&#13;
and sustainable privatization. For example, the value of the privatized entities will depend critically&#13;
upon the model of industry structure adopted and the regulatory framework that is implemented;&#13;
therefore, the financial accounting valuation, another necessary component of privatization, must&#13;
follow and not precede the economic and regulatory analysis.&#13;
16. In view of the detailed and complex steps that are needed in proper sequencing to undertake&#13;
privatization, the lack of an action plan is especially problematic. This lack is evidenced by the large&#13;
number of consulting activities that have been undertaken or are currently underway, financed by&#13;
different multilateral agencies, without ensuring that these activities are well-identified&#13;
components of a carefully designed action plan. To overcome these obstacles, this project would&#13;
serve as the vehicle to facilitate such coordination by assisting through the creation of an&#13;
infrastructure coordination unit and through the design of action plans and regulatory frameworks&#13;
for telecommunications and power. The project subsequently would finance a study to examine the&#13;
potential of expanding a similar approach to other services. MICDES is the entity responsible for&#13;
implementing activities within this subcomponent.&#13;
* Creation of infrastructure coordination unit. To rapidly improve infrastructure services&#13;
critical for competitiveness, it is important that a much greater degree of coordination and&#13;
coherence be achieved, both within the Government of El Salvador and among multilateral&#13;
agencies.&#13;
The project would finance a coordination unit to oversee the design of a privatization action&#13;
plans for telecommunications and energy, to oversee the design of terms of reference for the&#13;
various consulting assignments (including establishment of legal and regulatory frameworks,&#13;
scope of regulatory authorities, economic analyses of structural options and tariffs, financial&#13;
accounting analyses), and to monitor their execution. This would imply that in the future no&#13;
consulting assignments or activities would be undertaken unless they are well-defined&#13;
components of such action plans.&#13;
* Design of action plans and required regulatory frameworks. In the priority areas of&#13;
telecommunications and energy, there already exists some funding for consulting services to&#13;
develop the legal, regulatory and institutional framework and set up the regulatory entity,&#13;
including a US$ 1.97 million IDB project for restructuring and privatization of energy and&#13;
telecommunications sectors with MIF grant financing, and a US$ 1.2 million PHRD grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
with privatization as a possible component (connected with an IBRD energy sector&#13;
modernization project). This project would finance required coordination activities, as&#13;
described above. Based on this work, the project would study the potential of leveraging the&#13;
experience gained in telecommunications and energy to other infrastructure services. The&#13;
financing of transactions-related expenses tied to the sale of publicly held infrastructure assets&#13;
is proposed to be included in the complementary Public Sector Modernization Project&#13;
currently under preparation.&#13;
Deregulation and Facilitation (US$ 5.5 million, 27.5 % ofproject costs)&#13;
17.   Many laws, regulations and procedures in El Salvador are outdated and impose&#13;
burdensome bureaucratic requirements that restrict production and trade, and unnecessarily&#13;
increase the cost of doing business for both domestic and foreign investors. For example, an&#13;
investor must undertake over twenty different steps (down from a high of over forty) in order to&#13;
establish a corporation ready to do business. On the trade side, in spite of the ongoing process of&#13;
liberalization, there are a variety of regulatory and administrative impediments to trade and&#13;
commerce. Within the legal registries, delays have reached such a point that 1-2 years often are&#13;
required for an enterprise to register ownership of assets. The project would assist in three areas:&#13;
trade and investment deregulation, trade and investment facilitation, and the modernization of key&#13;
legal registries. The Ministry of Economy is the entity responsible for implementing all activities&#13;
within this subcomponent except for the legal registries, which fall under the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministry of Justice.&#13;
* Trade and investment deregulation. On the trade side, the project would support the Ministry&#13;
of Economy in carrying out a study of legaVregulatory impediments to trade and commerce.&#13;
Building on the findings of the recent PSA, several sectors with a particularly onerous&#13;
legal/regulatory burden, including pharmaceuticals and alcoholic beverages, would form the&#13;
focus of this effort.&#13;
On the investment side, the project would provide assistance to the Government in the&#13;
preparation of a new investment law, which would consider eliminating any differences&#13;
between treatment of foreign and domestic investors. In addition, the law and its attendant&#13;
regulations would specify clearly a limited set of pre-requisites for investment and would&#13;
eliminate all unnecessary administrative steps. Finally, with support of the project, the law&#13;
would establish a one-stop window (Oficina Nacional de Inversiones, or ONI) where&#13;
investors would be able to file documents and receive assistance in undertaking their projects.&#13;
* Trade and investment facilitation. As deregulation proceeds, a simultaneous effort should get&#13;
underway to build an institutional capacity for trade and investment facilitation/promotion.&#13;
On the trade side, a major legal/regulatory reform of Salvadoran customs and export&#13;
procedures has recently been completed. Building on recent computerization of customs and&#13;
export procedures, the project would provide technical assistance to design and install an&#13;
integrated system to facilitate international trade (Trade Point). By decision of the major&#13;
stakeholders, the Trade Point would be conceived as a first step in the establishment in El&#13;
Salvador of a comprehensive Trade Facilitation System similar to those operating in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Singapore or Brazil. Consequently, the Trade Point will have extensive services and be linked&#13;
with government and service organizations within the country through electronic data&#13;
interchange, and with worldwide networks through Internet. The Trade Point would provide&#13;
the following services: import/export processing, import/export information and technical&#13;
support; information on worldwide trade opportunities; trade statistics and analytical support;&#13;
trade-related services -- banking, insurance, transport, warehousing, etc. -- through affiliated&#13;
commercial enterprises; customized trade and investment-related studies and technical&#13;
assistance through affiliated organizations such as local universities and foundations; access to&#13;
worldwide information services and data bases; telecommunications services -- electronic&#13;
mail, teleconferencing, remote file transfer, facsimile, etc. The project would finance technical&#13;
assistance: (i) to identify any remaining legal and regulatory impediments to implement the&#13;
Trade Point, and undertake an action plan to address such obstacles; (ii) to develop a business&#13;
plan and design the systems and communications networks; computing and&#13;
telecommunications hardware, software and licenses; training; and marketing/constituency-&#13;
building necessary to establish the Trade Point. The parent public/private sector corporation&#13;
would provide initial capital for facilities, working capital and operating costs of the Trade&#13;
Point.&#13;
With respect to investment promotion, recent experience in El Salvador is credited with the&#13;
creation of 45,000 export-oriented jobs. However, the program requires support to improve&#13;
targeting of potential foreign investors and promote linkages between private and public&#13;
efforts to attract investment. Furthermore, the bilateral donor support which has sustained&#13;
this program is being phased out. In the area of export promotion, current public and private-&#13;
sector efforts require strengthening and streamlining. The project would provide assistance in&#13;
the preparation of organizational plans for two joint public-private agencies to promote&#13;
investment and exports, respectively, along with a strategy for identifying promotion&#13;
opportunities. This activity would benefit from a very close coordination with the public&#13;
information team.&#13;
Legal registries. Reform of Salvadoran legal registries, a potential tool for reducing&#13;
transactions costs and widening access to credit for small and medium enterprises, has yet to&#13;
be undertaken in several key areas. The registries for movable assets are not widely used due&#13;
to an inadequate legal framework for secured transactions; the few movable assets that have&#13;
been used as collateral to date are registered in the immovable assets registry. In addition, the&#13;
commercial registries are burdened with a large number of redundant registry requirements as&#13;
well as overly-complex procedures and a weak operational capacity. The legal framework for&#13;
protection of intellectual property has been recently strengthened as a result of international&#13;
agreements. However, the institutional capacity of the registry remains weak. The project&#13;
would provide sequential assistance to: (i) undertake a thorough review of the current legal&#13;
framework for movable assets and commercial registries; (ii) design and implement an action&#13;
plan for effective reform, including information dissemination, training and constituency-&#13;
building activities; and (iii) upgrade registry procedures and information systems for the three&#13;
registries. Improved provisions for registration of immovable assets are also important for&#13;
increased security in lending and reduced transactions costs. However, this area is the subject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
of the Bank-supported PRISA and Land Administration projects, as well as bilateral&#13;
assistance, and would not be addressed by this project.&#13;
Financial Markets Development (US$ 0.9 million, 4.5 % of project costs)&#13;
18.   The project aims to ensure the sustainability of reforms already undertaken in the financial&#13;
sector and to foster the development of a more efficient financial system which can support&#13;
private sector-led growth and increased international trade. To this end, the project would&#13;
provide focused support to consider removing legal and regulatory barriers to cross-border trade&#13;
and investment in financial services; develop an appropriate policy and regulatory framework for&#13;
liquidity provision, deposit insurance, and resolution/liquidation of failed financial institutions; and&#13;
improve certain aspects of the payment system. The project activities would complement the&#13;
ongoing Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) program to strengthen supervision under the&#13;
Superintendency of the Financial Sector and would be implemented in close coordination with&#13;
that program. The Central Bank is the entity responsible for implementing activities within this&#13;
subcomponent.&#13;
* Internationalization of financial service provision. As a result of the increasing integration of&#13;
the Salvadoran business community into international trading relationships and the large&#13;
Salvadoran community resident in the United States, the Salvadoran financial sector is&#13;
committed to increased integration into world financial markets. To this end, the project&#13;
would support a review of the legal/regulatory framework governing provision of banking and&#13;
non-banking services to identify impediments to greater internationalization of financial&#13;
service provision. Activities would include a systematic review of the financial sector&#13;
legal/regulatory framework to develop reforms to permit greater internationalization and freer&#13;
trade in financial services. Both banking and non-banking financial services would be&#13;
examined. In addition, the project would support design of a new law governing financial&#13;
groups to ensure a strong framework for the development of both domestic and cross-border&#13;
financial services.&#13;
* Liquidity Support. Deposit Insurance and Failure Resolution. In the context of increased&#13;
internationalization of the Salvadoran financial system, policies for deposit insurance, liquidity&#13;
support, and failure resolution have taken on greater importance. Currently, the framework to&#13;
address financial institutions with liquidity and/or solvency problems remains weak in critical&#13;
areas, thereby increasing systemic risk and raising the cost of any future financial crisis. The&#13;
framework for provision of liquidity by the Central Bank is not well-defined while the&#13;
guidelines for a deposit insurance fund remain to be established'. By contrast, the legal&#13;
framework for government intervention in troubled banks is relatively well-defined; however,&#13;
the procedures for liquidation of intervened banks are time-consuming and inefficient.&#13;
Liquidation procedures established by the Commercial Code create incentives for delay (3-4&#13;
years required for liquidation of a bank) and limit options such as rapid sale/merger of the&#13;
intervened institution. The project would: (i) help define the Central Bank's role in provision&#13;
Although there is currently no deposit insurance fnd in El Salvador, the Central Bank insures up to 40,000&#13;
colones (approx. US$ 4,600) per account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
of liquidity (in dollars and colones) to banks as Lender of Last Resort (LLR); (ii) assist in the&#13;
design of a self-financing (by participating banks) deposit insurance system; and (iii) review&#13;
the Commercial Code and propose reforns to facilitate rapid and flexible liquidation of&#13;
troubled banks.&#13;
Payment systems. The payment systems for activities such as check clearing, large value&#13;
transfers, and securities trading form a basic component of the financial infrastructure of the&#13;
country. Given the current growth trend of the financial system and the needs of greater&#13;
internationalization, failure to address reform of payment systems would result in increased&#13;
transactions costs, and increase risks to the Central Bank (and systemic risk). No system or&#13;
standards for automated processing of checks are currently in place. The sole check&#13;
clearinghouse in El Salvador (operated by the Central Bank) currently serves only the capital&#13;
city. In regional cities, settlement takes place on a bilateral basis via check, thereby increasing&#13;
systemic risk and transaction time. The result is an average clearing time of 3-4 days within&#13;
the capital and up to 7 days outside the capital city. In addition, no system currently exists for&#13;
providing same-day finality for large value inter-bank transfers, resulting in greater risks and&#13;
higher transactions costs. Settlement of funds transfers associated with securities transactions&#13;
is a particular area of concern: due to the lack of a same-day inter-bank settlement capability,&#13;
all securities market transactions are conducted through a single bank. Centralizing all&#13;
settlement of securities trading in this manner concentrates risk in the event of failure of the&#13;
settlement bank. In addition, the Central Bank is not connected to the SWIFT international&#13;
payments network, forcing all foreign exchange settlements to be effected via fax through one&#13;
commercial bank in Miami.&#13;
Based on the findings of a preliminary study by the Bank, the project would help design a&#13;
strategy for modernizing the payment systems through: reducing the barriers to automation of&#13;
check processing; reducing the check clearing cycle; providing same-day settlement capability;&#13;
automation of clearinghouse settlement operations; and providing Automated Clearinghouse&#13;
(ACH) capability. Under the component activities, the role of the Central Bank would be&#13;
limited primarily to that of regulator and supervisor of the payment system, with responsibility&#13;
for settlement of most transactions remaining with the commercial banks. Although the&#13;
procedures for large value inter-bank transfers through the Central Bank would be&#13;
modernized, creation of an automated system is unlikely in the short term due to the relatively&#13;
large fixed cost with respect to the quantity of transfers undertaken. The project would&#13;
support further research into the issues addressed above and would support development of&#13;
an action plan for implementation of an appropriate regulatory and legal framework for the&#13;
payment system.&#13;
(i;)   Technological CaDabilities (US$ 3.2 million, 16.0 % of Droject costs)&#13;
19.   Evidence from recent studies of the private sector in El Salvador (including the PSA)&#13;
indicates that enterprises in El Salvador face difficulties in reaching international standards of&#13;
quality and technical sophistication. In general, a low level of awareness prevails among firms&#13;
regarding the importance of quality and the management of technology and quality at the plant&#13;
level. A variety of reasons have been offered to explain this situation, including lack of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
competitive pressure, skills and training constraints (in part arising from reductions in education&#13;
and training during the civil war), and technology-related infrastructure constraints (arising from&#13;
the underdeveloped nature of: metrology, standards, testing, and quality control institutions;&#13;
technological information centers and extension services; and research and development&#13;
institutions linked with the potential users of the knowledge they create).&#13;
20.   Although the Government has made significant progress in eliminating the barriers which&#13;
have insulated Salvadoran firms from competitive pressure and plans to push further (competition&#13;
law and consumer protection, para. 13), much more needs to be done to develop a culture of&#13;
quality among firms, strengthen technology-related infrastructure and upgrade the skills of the&#13;
labor force. The task is especially important for Salvadoran enterprises operating in a global&#13;
environment where putting knowledge to productive use is critical. The two public institutions&#13;
concerned with technological development and technical training are CONACYT and&#13;
INSAFORP. Both institutions are recently created and need to sharpen their focus, ensure that&#13;
their activities are driven by the needs of the private sector, strengthen their roles as coordinators&#13;
and catalysts for the provision of services by private firms and non-profit organizations, and rid&#13;
themselves of baggage inherited from their predecessor institutions (e.g., labor obligations).&#13;
21.   This component would assist in the development of the public-private institutional&#13;
framework supporting technology development, diffusion, and training, via three activities: the&#13;
design of a national plan to increase quality and productivity, the strengthening of science and&#13;
technology policy and institutions, and the preparation of a strategic plan to implement a national&#13;
system for technical training. This activity would use as a basis both existing studies (e.g., science&#13;
and technology studies prepared by FUSADES and CONACYT) and two others to be prepared&#13;
under Japanese Grant Facility financing: (i) a series of practically-oriented studies of the factors&#13;
affecting the diffusion of new knowledge and technologies and their utilization in the productive&#13;
sectors; and (ii) a firm survey to understand how enterprises currently train their staff, what&#13;
sources of training they use (internal and external), their interest in using other forms of training&#13;
delivery, and their state of technological capabilities.&#13;
Quality and Productivity Program. There is a beginning awareness among enterprise&#13;
managers within El Salvador that a greater focus on quality and productivity is required. The&#13;
project would support a study to design a "Salvadoran Quality and Productivity Program" to&#13;
promote a greater focus on total quality management across enterprises. The Program would&#13;
encompass public policies, institutional structure and responsibilities, training programs, and&#13;
promotional efforts. The specific needs of small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) would&#13;
be addressed. The design of the program would follow from a country-specific diagnosis of&#13;
the incentives and constraints faced by firms in attaining international quality levels; use&#13;
lessons from other countries who have implemented quality and productivity programs; and&#13;
recommend a strategy and detailed action plan to implement the program. The Ministry of&#13;
Economy is the entity responsible for implementing these activities.&#13;
First, the study would begin with an evaluation of quality and productivity indicators of&#13;
domestically-produced goods and services vis-a-vis those of the country's competitors in&#13;
international markets (such as rejection and rework rates, average delivery time, inventory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
rotations, machine downtime, R&amp;D expenditures, training, and hierarchical levels), in order to&#13;
establish both a baseline (where El Salvador is starting from relative to international best&#13;
practice) and a benchmark (what El Salvador will strive to attain in a specified time frame).&#13;
Second, the study would analyze the reasons for departures from international quality&#13;
standards and market expectations. This diagnosis would include: an evaluation of the&#13;
incentives faced by firms to improve quality, utilize new technologies, and innovate, and the&#13;
role of the policy environment in determining these incentives; and an evaluation of factors&#13;
constraining the ability of firms to reach international standards (e.g., factor market&#13;
conditions, physical infrastructure, technology-related infrastructure, labor skills).&#13;
Third, the study would evaluate, and propose a strategy for strengthening: the institutional&#13;
framework supporting the diffusion of quality standards (metrology, standards, testing, and&#13;
quality laboratories; technology extension services; public and private training institutions;&#13;
certification and accreditation institutions, including for ISO-9000 and the forthcoming&#13;
environment-focused IS0-14000; producers' associations; etc.); the channels of diffusion of&#13;
quality standards to and among firms; and the division of responsibilities between the public&#13;
and private sectors, with clear justifications for the public sector's future role.&#13;
Fourth, the study would propose a strategy for private sector-led training in quality&#13;
management programs: evaluate the needs for firm-level training in total quality management,&#13;
for all levels of management and employees; determine appropriate institutional&#13;
responsibilities and alliances for training programs; and design a program of training, with&#13;
targets and timing, to disseminate total quality management programs in the private sector.&#13;
Fifth, the study would propose a strategy and program to raise awareness of the importance of&#13;
quality management and the achievement of international standards among firms, as well as a&#13;
marketing plan for the Program, in order to stimulate firms to adopt quality management&#13;
techniques, train their employees, and ultimately change their corporate culture.&#13;
Sixth, the study would assess the availability of financing for firm-led quality management&#13;
programs and propose a strategy for financing the proposed Program, with a special focus on&#13;
SMEs.&#13;
Finally, the study would design and test a pilot training program of "quality multipliers" on a&#13;
matching grant basis (individuals who go back to enterprises to spread the new quality&#13;
management language).&#13;
* Science and Technology Policy and Institutional Development. The Conisejo Nacional de&#13;
Cienciay Tecnologia (CONACYT), created by Decree 287 in 1992, operates under the&#13;
Ministry of Economy. The general objective of CONACYT is to formulate and direct&#13;
national policy regarding scientific and technological development. More specifically,&#13;
CONACYT coordinates and directs metrology, standards, testing, and quality (MSTQ)&#13;
activities, guides public investments in science and technology, coordinates external technical&#13;
assistance for science and technology, and promotes the diffusion of technology. Currently,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
CONACYT's operations are spread thinly across a diverse set of planned programs and are&#13;
supported by a very modest fiscal budgetary allocation. In the past, it has given too little&#13;
attention to the diffusion of information relevant to the productive sector, and its coordination&#13;
with other science and technology-related institutions (the Centro Nacional de Tecnologia&#13;
Agropecuariay Forestal (CENTA), the Ministerio de Agriculturay Ganaderia, the&#13;
Universidad de El Salvador) has been insufficient.&#13;
CONACYT is currently developing a program of institutional strengthening supported by the&#13;
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE), which is focused on the non-&#13;
agricultural sectors of industry. The project would complement these activities by supporting&#13;
the preparation of a diagnostic study of priorities for science and technology policy and&#13;
institutions for agriculture and agro-industry. This study would focus on the role of&#13;
CONACYT as a coordinator of decentralized and private sector-led technological&#13;
development (including coordination of activities with CENTA and other agencies), and&#13;
develop an action plan for implementation of the strategy. Based on the BCIE program and&#13;
on the results of a diagnostic preparatory study financed by the Japanese Grant facility, the&#13;
project also would strengthen local capacity in product quality certification services, as well as&#13;
strengthening the capacity of laboratories that provide these services.&#13;
Strategic Plan for Technical Training. The Instituto Salvadoreno de Formaci6n Profesional&#13;
(INSAFORP) was created by Decree 554 of July 1993, replacing a similar training agency in&#13;
the Ministry of Labor (the Centro de Formaci6n Profesionaf). Decree 544 gave INSAFORP&#13;
financial as well as administrative autonomy: funding for INSAFORP is provided by an&#13;
earmarked 1 percent payroll tax that is channeled directly to INSAFORP. The private sector&#13;
contributions are to be phased in over five years (0.2 percent in 1994, 0.4 percent in 1995, 0.6&#13;
percent in 1996, 0.8 percent in 1997, and 1.0 percent in 1998).&#13;
Since its creation, INSAFORP has made significant efforts to review and redefine its role, in&#13;
order to ensure that their activities are oriented under efficiency criteria and driven by the&#13;
needs of the private sector. Even though INSAFORP is authorized to provide training&#13;
directly, as well as to coordinate and regulate training provided by other institutions and by&#13;
firms themselves, INSAFORP's directorate has delirnited the institution's mandate by&#13;
adopting a role of coordination, regulation, and certification, leaving the direct provision of&#13;
training services to collaborating institutions. Also, consistent with this view, INSAFORP has&#13;
held consultations with the private sector, resulting in the proposal of revisions to the payroll-&#13;
tax obligation on firms which are now being analyzed at the legislative chamber.&#13;
Currently, international organizations such as the International Labor Organization (ILO),&#13;
GTZ and the European Union are conduction focused activities with INSAFORP to support&#13;
institutional development needs. Nevertheless, much work is still required to sharpen&#13;
INSAFORP's role within the national training system and enhance its operational capacity.&#13;
The technical assistance provided by the Bank under this Project would support the design of&#13;
a demand-driven national scheme for technical-training provision through a dual approach:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(i) The design of a strategic program for INSAFORP and the development of an action plan&#13;
for its implementation. The report would use as starting point the studies and surveys made&#13;
under the Japanese Grant Facility referred to above, to diagnose and identify current and&#13;
future needs for technical training; to assess the human, physical and financial capacity of&#13;
existing training institutions to identify potential INSAFORP's collaborating institutions; and&#13;
to provide the basis for strengthening the system according to the competitiveness challenges&#13;
firms will face under the new business environment of the Salvadoran economy.&#13;
The strategic program must include the revision of current regulations and institutional&#13;
arrangements for INSAFORP's activities; internal organization and structure; the clear&#13;
delimitation of target groups (employees of contributing firms/employees of non-contributing&#13;
firms/government/unemployed); assessment and proposal of alternative financing mechanisms;&#13;
establishment of criteria and mechanisms for identifying private sector needs and ensuring an&#13;
adequate matching with the supply of training services, conditions for certification; the&#13;
responsibilities and involvement of each of the parties involved in the training system (i.e.&#13;
INSAFORP, training institutions, and the private and labor sectors); and a strategy for&#13;
marketing and improving the credibility of INSAFORP's activities within the national training&#13;
system.&#13;
(ii) Exposure to international experiences and lessons and the skills upgrading of the staff&#13;
involved in the national training system to enhance the operational knowledge and executing&#13;
capacity of the system. The project would finance the hiring foreign trainers, consultants, and&#13;
experts, as well as study tours abroad. It would also include the attendance to and&#13;
participation in international forums and symposiums, short courses and twinning&#13;
(apprenticeship) groups, and study tours to visit and assess the experience of other training-&#13;
system's institutions and coordinators in other countries.&#13;
(iii)   Public Information ($ 5.0 million, 25.0 % of iro*ect costs)&#13;
22.   The success of the Government's competitiveness enhancement efforts will depend in part&#13;
on the understanding and support of key domestic constituencies and the local public at large.&#13;
The high rankings that both political and policy uncertainty received in the PSA survey as&#13;
obstacles to enterprise operation and growth underscores the need for the Govermment both to&#13;
better articulate and communicate its policies to its constituencies and to better listen and be&#13;
responsive to the broad public's concems. The Government has made an explicit commitment to&#13;
ensure the participation of all sectors of society in the development of the current economic&#13;
model, including explicit communications to the broad public of the benefits of globalization. A&#13;
particular area of concem is the need for improved cooperation between business leaders and&#13;
workers, to ensure that managers and workers do not view themselves as adversaries but rather&#13;
allies in the pursuit of increased productivity. To build consensus for activities of the other two&#13;
components, financing already has been included for activity-specific study tours, twinning&#13;
arrangements and working groups where appropriate. In addition, to help build broader support&#13;
for desirable economic and social changes, this component addresses broader cross-cutting&#13;
information dissemination and coordination issues, and includes the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
* Public information program. The main objectives of this program include: educating the&#13;
public about the rationale for the most critical economic and social reforms for&#13;
competitiveness, the impact those reforms will have on their families and lives, and the&#13;
specifics of individual reform initiatives; enhancing the capacity of the Government to gather&#13;
and disseminate accurate information to the media and the general public; improving the&#13;
overall effectiveness of Government public affairs officials and journalists specializing in&#13;
coverage of the economic and social reform process; and providing policymakers with&#13;
feedback on reform initiatives from key constituencies in order to better inform and refine the&#13;
policymaking process. This program would operate as an umbrella activity to assist in&#13;
building consensus around each of the other activities of the project, in addition to assisting in&#13;
educating the public about the importance of other key economic and social reforms for&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
The project would assist in building institutional capacity in this area through: developing and&#13;
helping to implement a two-way government information strategy, both disseminating&#13;
information and receiving information from the broad public on economic reform initiatives;&#13;
providing day-to-day support for intensified efforts to actively explain government reform&#13;
initiatives to the public and to key constituencies; helping to organize an institutional&#13;
framework for gathering and disseminating information to the media and general public; and&#13;
promoting a two-way outreach to key constituencies and coalitions (including through&#13;
seminars, public awareness advertising, and distribution of educational materials). The&#13;
consultants and local team implementing this activity would coordinate with the&#13;
Implementation Units responsible for the implementation of each of the other project&#13;
activities, to help build support for these activities and inform the public about their links with&#13;
the country's long-run competitiveness. As part of this effort, the project would finance the&#13;
production and dissemination of a series of short and focused Technical Notes (or&#13;
"information briefs", that summarize lessons of international experience and highlight their&#13;
relevance for El Salvador) --as well as other appropriate information dissemination&#13;
mechanisms as needed as project implementation proceeds-- to provide a focal point for&#13;
implementation (on specific topics of concern including competition law, consumer&#13;
protection, legal registries, financial markets development, and technology and training).&#13;
These Notes would be proposed by the implementing agencies in consultation with the public&#13;
information team, be produced and disseminated in cooperation with private sector groups,&#13;
and use materials and reviews from the Bank. MICDES is the entity responsible for&#13;
implementing these activities.&#13;
* Study tours and working groups. Rigorously structured and focused study tours can be an&#13;
extremely useful mechanism to help develop a shared vision of a country's future. The project&#13;
would help build a consensus view of desirable strategies by offering the opportunity to&#13;
groups composed of the main concerned constituencies to go on such study tours.&#13;
Participants typically would be selected from the legislative assembly, the private sector, the&#13;
labor movement, the academic community, the media, and the Government. The first study&#13;
tour would focus on competitive strategies adopted by Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.&#13;
The other tours likely would focus on: (i) agricultural development; (ii) financial sector&#13;
development; and (iii) improving labor-business relations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
To augment this process, six sector working groups are to be established: one for the&#13;
legislative assembly and political parties; for the private sector; for the labor sector; for the&#13;
academic community; for the media; and for the general public. These working groups would&#13;
be a forum to discuss and disseminate findings, as well as periodically monitor and evaluate&#13;
the overall impact of the project in general terms. To assist in monitoring the ongoing impact&#13;
of the project, a small enterprise-level survey will be administered in the third year, including&#13;
subjective responses such as changes in perceptions as a result of project activities. This&#13;
survey would update baseline data from an initial survey undertaken as part of preparatory&#13;
activities under Japan Grant financing. The Ministry of Economy is the entity responsible for&#13;
implementing these activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
23.   The project would be implemented under a three-tiered administrative structure: a high-&#13;
level council for policy direction and promotion; a coordinating unit led by MICDES to oversee&#13;
project execution and link project activities with the direction of the high-level council; and a set&#13;
of implementing agencies that would be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of&#13;
individual project components. The second and third tiers would be the critical levels to ensure&#13;
timely and effective implementation. The private sector would be directly represented in the first&#13;
two tiers and informally represented as appropriate at the third tier, working in partnership with&#13;
the public sector to achieve the project's objectives, ensuring continuous private sector input, and&#13;
building consensus with its constituencies.&#13;
24.   Promotion. As the first tier, a National Council for Competitiveness (Consejo Nacional&#13;
de la Competitividad), a joint private-public entity consisting of representatives from leading&#13;
private sector organizations and relevant Government agencies has been established to enhance&#13;
support for the project. The Council is headed by the Minister of Economy (project "champion"),&#13;
as representative of the principal Government ministry directly responsible for relations with the&#13;
private sector, and is composed of principal "owners" and "clients" of the project: this first-tier&#13;
structure is composed of representatives from the public sector (including the Ministers of&#13;
Economy, MICDES, Finance, Justice and the Central Bank President) and representatives from&#13;
the business sector (including heads of ANEP, ASI, CCI, COEXPORT and FUSADES). It&#13;
would serve as a high-level entity to promote the project's objectives and activities, set overall&#13;
guidelines for project execution, and evaluate reform proposals to enhance private sector&#13;
competitiveness. The Council should meet at least three times a year, and more frequently if&#13;
necessary.&#13;
25.   Coordination. A small, permanent service-oriented Coordination Unit (the second tier)&#13;
would be responsible to ensure timely and effective implementation of the project across all&#13;
activities. It would include a full-time Project Coordinator from MICDES, and a Private Sector&#13;
Coordinator available on a daily basis and paid for by the project. The Project Coordinator from&#13;
MICDES would oversee project execution, and ensure that all activities are properly sequenced&#13;
and technically well implemented; this Project Coordinator would receive additional support for&#13;
coordination work as needed from other officials within MICDES, and would work closely with&#13;
subcomponent implementation Leaders ("Jefes de Ejecuci6n ", see below). The Private Sector&#13;
Coordinator would represent private sector interests, ensure that private sector concerns are&#13;
reflected during implementation (including via detailed comments on all final terms of reference&#13;
and throughout implementation of activities), communicate necessary feedback to the Council,&#13;
and work closely with the representatives of individual private sector organizations (ANEP, ASI,&#13;
CCI, COEXPORT and FUSADES) assisting in implementation of specific project components.&#13;
In addition to working closely with the Private Sector Coordinator (on a daily basis) and the&#13;
representatives of individual private sector organizations (through monthly meetings or more&#13;
frequently if necessary), the Project Coordinator would also interact periodically with labor&#13;
representatives, in particular to ensure their input into the labor training component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
26.   Implementation. The Coordination Unit would be charged with overall support of&#13;
implementation of the project. An experienced team within MICDES and reporting to the&#13;
Coordination Unit would act as Financial Agent for the project, executing all procurement and&#13;
disbursement under the project and maintaining all financial records. During the start-up phase of&#13;
the project, the Coordination Unit would be supported by qualified international or local&#13;
consultants as needed. An agent acceptable to the Bank would be designated by the Government&#13;
to undertake all contracting for international consultants under the project. For each project&#13;
subcomponent, a Working Team (Equipo de Trabajo) would be created, with a Leader (Jefe de&#13;
Ejecuci6n) responsible for implementation. Each Leader would be a senior individual within the&#13;
respective Government institution (namely the Ministries of the Economy and Justice, MICDES,&#13;
the Central Bank, CONACYT and INSAFORP), and would be supported by other officials in the&#13;
Working Team. Each Working Team would be charged with developing specific terms of&#13;
reference for hiring of consultants and technical specifications for purchase of equipment, with&#13;
support from the Coordination Unit. The Working Teams would work in close contact with the&#13;
Coordination Unit, with as many meetings during the life of the project as necessary to ensure&#13;
timely and well-executed implementation.&#13;
27.   The project is anticipated to be implemented over the course of roughly three years.&#13;
Project completion is scheduled for December 1998 and the project closing date would be June&#13;
30, 1999.&#13;
H.   PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
28.   Estimated project costs, described in Schedule A (total cost including Bank and&#13;
Government financing of US$ 20.00 million) are as follows: the Business Environment&#13;
component (US$ 10.54 million) including support to the Ministry of the Economy, Ministry of&#13;
Justice, MICDES, and the Central Bank; the Technological Capabilities component (US$ 3.17&#13;
million) including support to the Ministry of Economy, CONACYT and INSAFORP; and the&#13;
Public Information component (US$ 5.00 million) with support to the Ministry of Economy and&#13;
WCDES. An additional US$ 0.60 million in Bank and Government financing would support the&#13;
activities of the Coordination Unit in MICDES and the Implementation Units in each of the&#13;
ministries. US$ 0.69 million would be allocated for physical and price contingencies in the&#13;
implementation of the project. The Bank would provide US$ 16.0 million, four-fifths of the total&#13;
financing, and the Government the remaining US$ 4.0 million.&#13;
29.   The Republic of El Salvador is eligible for the single currency loan and anticipates&#13;
borrowing US$116 million from IBRD on a single currency loan basis during FY96 including&#13;
US$ 16.0 million for this project. The loan would be a U.S. dollar single currency loan for 17&#13;
years, including 5 years of grace, at the IBRD's standard LIBOR-based rate for such loans.&#13;
30.   Financial Benefits. The Republic of El Salvador has selected U.S. dollar-based single&#13;
currency loan terms in order to improve its overall liability management and reduce its risks. It&#13;
considers the U.S. dollar to be an appropriate currency for its debt management strategy, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
prefers the standard country repayment terms for LIBOR-based single currency loans compared&#13;
to the shorter final maturity for fixed-rate currency loans.&#13;
31.   Procurement. Two types of procurement would be undertaken through the Loan: (i)&#13;
consultant services for each of the participating institutions; and (ii) goods, primarily computer&#13;
hardware and software and communications equipment. Selection and appointment of consultants&#13;
for studies, technical assistance, and support of project execution would be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Procurement of goods would follow the&#13;
Bank Guidelines for Procurement (1995). To the extent feasible and practicable, the procurement&#13;
of goods would be done by grouping the various items in bid packages estimated to cost US$&#13;
100,000 equivalent or more. Packages in this category would be required to follow Limited&#13;
International Bidding (LLB) procedures using the Bank Standard Bidding Documents. LIB&#13;
procedures are justified given the small number of providers with after-delivery service in El&#13;
Salvador. In the case of procurement of complex information and communication systems, the&#13;
Bank would recommend a two-stage bidding process which includes a stage for technical&#13;
qualification prior to economic evaluation. National and international shopping procedures in&#13;
accordance with paragraph 3.5 of Bank procurement guidelines would be used for purchases of&#13;
goods estimated to cost respectively, less than US$ 50,000 per contract up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$ 400,000 (for national shopping), and less than US$ 100,000 per contract up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$ 500,000 (for international shopping).&#13;
32.   Bank review of procurement procedures would be as follows: (i) for consulting services,&#13;
the Bank would conduct prior review for all contracts of US$ 50,000 or more equivalent for&#13;
individuals and US$ 100,000 or more equivalent for firms; and (ii) for procurement of goods the&#13;
Bank would review ex ante documentation pertaining to each LIB undertaken; (iii) all other&#13;
procurement documentation is subject to ex post review. This review process would result in a&#13;
prior review of approximately 90% of all Bank-financed contracts for goods.&#13;
33.   Disbursements. Proceeds of the proposed Loan would finance: (i) 100% of the cost of&#13;
foreign goods, consulting services, training and technical assistance; and (ii) 87% of the cost of&#13;
local goods. To facilitate disbursement under the loan, a Special Account would be established in&#13;
the Central Bank, at the discretion of the Government, with an authorized allocation of US$ 1.5&#13;
million equivalent, representing the average amount equivalent to four months of eligible&#13;
expenditures that are expected to be paid from the account. Separate accounts of all expenditures&#13;
financed by the Project would be maintained by the MICDES. Withdrawal applications would be&#13;
fully documented, except for contracts smaller than the following specified levels: US$ 100,000&#13;
for goods; US$ 50,000 for individual consultants; and US$ 100,000 for consulting firms. In the&#13;
case of contracts below these specified levels, the MICDES would prepare certified Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOE) to be used as the basis for disbursement. Supporting documentation for SOEs&#13;
would be retained by MICDES and made available for examination by Bank staff during&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
34.   Retroactive financing of up to US$ 1.6 million equivalent would be provided for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred after June 1, 1995 (approximately 10% of the total loan), to fund initial&#13;
studies and project start-up activities.&#13;
mL!. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
35.   Supervision. The Bank would support the implementation of the project through frequent&#13;
and regular supervision missions and at other times as requested by the Government, with a total&#13;
supervision input in the first year of at least 35 staff weeks. Bank supervision resources may&#13;
exceed this level given the pilot nature of several activities and the intention to link closely&#13;
otherwise free-standing analytic work with project implementation. Bank supervision resources&#13;
would include inputs from the Regional (LAC) and Central (FPD) Vice-Presidencies, External&#13;
Affairs Department, Economic Development Institute (EDI), and Foreign Investment Advisory&#13;
Services (FIAS, IFC), with an expected contribution by FPD in the business environment and&#13;
technological capabilities components, by External Affairs and EDI in the Public Information&#13;
component, and by FIAS in the investment deregulation and facilitation activities. A semi-annual&#13;
review of project implementation would be conducted jointly by the Government and the Bank&#13;
during September and March of each year and would evaluate project performance against the&#13;
matrix of key project activities and implementation targets (see below). Attachment III provides&#13;
greater detail regarding estimated resources required for supervision.&#13;
36.   Monitoring Indicators. To facilitate monitoring and supervision, the project includes both&#13;
imnplementation and impact indicators. Project implementation indicators are defined as&#13;
identifiable project outputs, that is, monitorable targets linked to the broader Government&#13;
objectives to help the Government achieve its goals. For example, linked to the objective of&#13;
increasing domestic competition are the following specific expected project outputs: by April&#13;
1996, draft competition legislation should be finalized and presented to Congress; by June 1997&#13;
the competition office should be operational; and by December 1997, draft bankruptcy legislation&#13;
should be finalized and presented to Congress (a somewhat less urgent commitment). As another&#13;
example, linked to the objective of increasing competitiveness by modernizing the financial system&#13;
are the following specific project outputs: formulation of implementation plan in the area of&#13;
liquidity support by October 1996, deposit insurance by January 1997, and definition of policy for&#13;
Lender of Last Resort by March 1997; and an implementation plan in the area of&#13;
internationalization of financial services provision by June 1998. The full list of project&#13;
implementation indicators is provided in the Project Implementation Plan matrix, Attachment II.&#13;
37.   The Government also has included project impact indicators as part of this project, to help&#13;
monitor the impact of project activities on the economy; an initial list of project impact indicators&#13;
is provided in Attachment H. A revised list of quantitative impact indicators will be included in&#13;
the final Project Implementation Plan and monitored as appropriate, including for instance&#13;
changes in the number of days for approval of new investments resulting from the effectiveness of&#13;
ONI. Since it is difficult to establish quantitative impact indicators for many activities and to link&#13;
changes in those indicators to changes due to the project, the project also will include an&#13;
enterprise-level survey administered during the third year designed to update baseline data,&#13;
including subjective responses such as changes in perceptions as a result of project activities. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
initial enterprise-level survey, currently under preparation and financed under the Japan Grant&#13;
facility, will provide baseline data for these subjective responses. Baseline data for the&#13;
quantitative indicators will be compiled from existing data sources.&#13;
38.   Accounts and Audits. The Coordination Unit (MICDES), with the support of the&#13;
Implementation Unit for each sub-component, would maintain adequate records of all financial&#13;
transactions made under the project. The records would form the basis for generating monthly&#13;
financial statements to inform the Project Coordinator. The Project Coordinator would prepare&#13;
and forward to the Bank semi-annual reports on the status of implementation to be discussed&#13;
during the corresponding semi-annual reviews.&#13;
39.   The Central Bank, which would be the depository for funds in the Special Account, would&#13;
provide the Coordination Unit with a monthly statement reflecting the deposits to and&#13;
withdrawals from the Special Account and any related sub-accounts. The Coordination Unit&#13;
would forward each monthly statement to the Bank in conjunction with their respective monthly&#13;
Withdrawal Applications soliciting funds from the Loan Account to replenish the Special&#13;
Account. The Coordination Unit would keep separate records for all financial transactions&#13;
affecting the Special Account and/or related sub-accounts.&#13;
40.   At the end of each Fiscal Year, the Coordination Unit would prepare annual Project&#13;
Financial Statements covering ali project activities. The annual Project Financial Statements&#13;
would be audited by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank, in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing. The audit reports would include separate&#13;
opinions concerning: (i) the eligibility of transactions in the Special Account during the year, and&#13;
on the closing balance of this account; (ii) the eligibility of expenditures claimed under the&#13;
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) disbursement procedure; and (iii) a note highlighting any special&#13;
issues relating to project execution. In instances where issues were highlighted for resolution, the&#13;
Coordination Unit in conjunction with the relevant Implementation Unit would propose&#13;
recommended actions. The Coordination Unit would submit the audit reports to the Bank within&#13;
six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
41.   Within six months of project completion, the Coordination Unit and all Implementing&#13;
Units would collaborate with the Bank in producing an Implementation Completion Report to&#13;
assess project effectiveness and its contribution to sustainable development activities.&#13;

Note: Since it is difficult to establish quantitative impact indicators for many activities and&#13;
to link changes in those indicators to changes due to the project, the project also will&#13;
include an enterprise-level survey administered during the third year designed to update&#13;
baseline data, including subjective responses such as changes in perceptions as a result of&#13;
project activities. An initial enterprise-level survey, currently under preparation and&#13;
financed under the Japan Grant facility, will provide baseline data for these subjective&#13;
responses. Baseline data for the above quantitative indicators will be compiled from&#13;
existing data sources.&#13;

            El Salvador - Competitiveness Enhancement
            Technical Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Competitiveness Enhancement
            Technical Assistance Project will support the
            Government's program to accelerate outward-oriented
            private sector development and raise productivity. To start
            moving toward these desirable long-term objectives, the
            project will facilitate change by improving the enabling
            environment in three areas: 1) the business environment,
            lowering the cost of doing business in El Salvador; 2) the
            environment for technological capabilities of private sector
            enterprises and labor, in order to raise productivity and
            international competiveness; and 3) the environment for
            building consensus on economic competitiveness issues, by
            facilitating the flow of public information and public
            sector-private sector dialogue.
