            Global trend to railway concessions
            delivering positive results
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The authors review a number of recent
            innovative rail concessions. Each country has approached its
            problems differently, and each provides different insights
            into what can be achieved with concessions. But all the
            cases show that restructuring and substantial government
            investment in the design of a concession pay off.
            Concessionaires can do exactly what is expected-increase
            traffic, improve service, and enhance labor and asset
            efficiency if they are allowed to do so. A growing number of
            companies and consortiums are interested in investing in
            railway concessions if the concessions are offered on
            reasonable terms. And because both "positive"
            (where the concessionaire pays the government an agreed sum
            for the concession rights) and "negative" (where
            the government pays the concessionaire to operate and
            maintain the property) concessions are possible, loss-making
            but socially necessary services can also be concessioned.
            Perhaps the most important innovation in railway
            organization over the next few decades will be in the
            European Union. Regulatory changes have ignited a clear
            trend in the EU toward institutional separation of
            infrastructure from operations because infrastructure is
            seen as a state responsibility while operations (except for
            social services) are seen as commercial. One eventual result
            of institutional separation will be franchising or even
            privatization of most freight services and possibly
            intercity passenger services.
