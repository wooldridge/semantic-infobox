1. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Lesotho is a poor, mountainous and landlocked country, completely surrounded&#13;
by the Republic of South Africa (RSA). Lesotho has been historically described as a&#13;
"labor reserve" for South Africa's mines. About one half of those who are formally&#13;
employed work in the mines of South Africa and one third of gross national product&#13;
(GNP) is accounted for by migrant miners' remittances. However, formal employment&#13;
constitutes only 28 percent of total employment in the country, and 72 percent of the&#13;
labor force is engaged in agriculture and the informal sector at implicit wages that are&#13;
typically below the poverty line. The 1994 Poverty Assessment study shows continuing&#13;
high levels of relative poverty (50 percent) and unemployment, principally as a result of&#13;
the loss of employment opportunities for Basotho workers in South Africa's mining&#13;
industry. Those are a major cause for concern to the Government, which is committed to&#13;
poverty alleviation and has developed a strategy, the objectives of which are to: (i) create&#13;
jobs; and (ii) generate growth in the economy. A key aspect to achieve these objectives&#13;
relies on the shift of the public works program towards labor-based methods. Another&#13;
key aspect is to provide access to isolated areas poorly served by the current road network&#13;
through instating maintenance and improving road conditions to all-year round&#13;
serviceability.&#13;
1.2   Despite a growth of about 15 percent per year in the export sector, and 10% gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP) growth rates, no substantial unemployment reduction has&#13;
occurred. Agriculture, including animal husbandry, which contributes at least partially to&#13;
the income and employment of approximately 70 percent of all households, accounts for&#13;
only 15 percent of GDP. Manufacturing and construction continue to grow and make up&#13;
about 36 percent of GDP. There is significant new employment in garment&#13;
manufacturing for export, and good prospects for further employment growth in this&#13;
sector. Commerce and government, however, remain the largest contributors to GDP,&#13;
with Government services (including the commercial parastatals) accounting for almost&#13;
half of the production of this sector. Although equitable, broad-based growth of the&#13;
economy will depend on both the agricultural and industrial sectors, since agriculture has&#13;
limited capacity to absorb excess labor, growth will have to be led by the private&#13;
commercial and industrial sectors. Approximately one half of the government revenue&#13;
comes from Lesotho's share of import tariffs collected by the Southern Africa Custom&#13;
Union (SACU).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.3    By the mid- 1980s, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) realized that its former&#13;
policy of aiming for economic self-sufficiency by following a parastatal-led, import-&#13;
substitution strategy was unsustainable. An alarming fiscal deficit induced the&#13;
Govermment to develop in 1988, with the assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, a&#13;
strategy aimed at stabilizing the economy. The main objectives of the structural&#13;
adjustment program were to strengthen fiscal discipline, diversify the country's export&#13;
base, and improve social services. Following a period of slow growth in real GDP in the&#13;
first half of the 1980s (averaging 1.7 percent a year), real GDP grew considerably&#13;
between 1988 to 1994, achieving an average annual growth rate of 8.5 percent. This&#13;
growth was due in large part to a 16 percent growth rate of manufacturing and&#13;
construction, including in particular activities within the Lesotho Highlands Water&#13;
Project (LHWP), which counterbalanced the effects of two drought years and a decline in&#13;
mineworkers remittances. In 1994, GNP per capita was US$700 in current Dollar terms.&#13;
In addition substantial progress has been made in controlling expenditures and putting in&#13;
place revenue enhancement measures. The fiscal deficit of 9 percent of GNP in 1988/89&#13;
was reversed to a small fiscal surplus by 1992/93. Currently, thc government is a net&#13;
repayer to the banking system, removing earlier concerns that bank financing would not&#13;
be available to the private sector.&#13;
1.4    However, during this period of stabilization, implementation of structural reforms&#13;
has been slow, in particular in civil service capacity-building, which threatens&#13;
achievements of the adjustment program. A fifth five-year development plan has been&#13;
elaborated for the years 1991/1996. Its four overarching objectives are: (i) economic&#13;
recovery and sustainable growth to provide the population with a better access to basic&#13;
services; (ii) creation of an enabling environment to facilitate the role of the private sector&#13;
in delivering services, with special reference to the development of a private construction&#13;
industry, and privatization or restructuring of public enterprises and parastatals; and (iii)&#13;
removal of capacity constraints in the public sector, and decentralization, which has&#13;
recently led to the first democratic election of Village District Councils (VDCs). The&#13;
recent three-year Policy Framework Paper, supported by an IMF-financed 12-month&#13;
stand-by arrangement, recommends to accelerate the creation of a better investmen.&#13;
climate for foreign capital, increase the pace of privatization, and not maintain fiscal&#13;
surpluses by under-investing in infrastructure and human capital.&#13;
1.5   The Government's infrastructure strategy focuses on poverty reduction and&#13;
employment creation through the expansion of labor-based public works, improving the&#13;
coverage and quality of basic services, increasing the role of the private sector in the&#13;
delivery of basic infrastructure services, privatizing public enterprises and parastatals, and&#13;
removing capacity constraints in the public sector. It emphasizes (i) increasing the role of&#13;
the private sector; (ii) capacity building and investment in human resources; and (iii)&#13;
improved cost recovery of services, and a better balanced and increased overall level of&#13;
recurrent and investment expenditures. Currently, the implementation of the&#13;
Govermment's infrastructure strategy is constrained by limited line ministerial capacity in&#13;
planning, accounting and management, and the excessive reliance on force account&#13;
arrangements for providing services. Civil service reform, and support to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
development of the private sector and privatization of those activities that can be best&#13;
performed by the private sector, are central to the improvement of the efficiency and&#13;
management of public utilities and services.&#13;
1.6   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lesotho emphasizes the direct and&#13;
indirect poverty-reducing effects of expanding and improving rural and peri-urban&#13;
infrastructure, and increasing the share of civil works being carried out using labor-based&#13;
techniques. It supports (i) maintaining and strengthening structural reforms to create&#13;
employment and improve incomes; (ii) addressing capacity constraints in the public&#13;
sector through capacity building and investment in human resources, and involving&#13;
communities in the development and management of services; and (iii) capturing the&#13;
benefits of the LHWP, and in particular strengthening rural development through a&#13;
clearer and more transparent use of the Development Fund (into which the revenues of&#13;
the LHWP are being deposited. As a result of the 1994 Bank's Poverty Assessment&#13;
study, a poverty reduction action plan was elaborated jointly with the Government and&#13;
the Lesotho Council of NGOs. It stresses the need for a major expansion of labor-based&#13;
public works, including restoring or instating the serviceability of roads to provide isolated&#13;
areas with all-year round access. An improved and better balanced road network will&#13;
facilitate economic development and the extension of basic social services in the remote,&#13;
poor areas of the country. The Government has already acted on these recommendations,&#13;
and is currently executing a major new public works initiative financed from the Revenue&#13;
Fund of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) to the benefit of rural&#13;
communities, which have overwhelmingly chosen road infrastructure as priority&#13;
investments. The proposed operation would be an integral part of IDA's ongoing&#13;
assistance to GOL aimed at facilitating economic development and reducing poverty by&#13;
extending basic services and growth to isolated parts of the country, through financing key&#13;
parts of the National Road Program and ensuring the link between village-built roads and&#13;
the rest of the network. A key aspect of the proposed project is to rapidly increase the&#13;
institutional capacity and substantially accelerate private sector participation in road&#13;
activities, in order to effectively handle the substantially higher level of road activities.&#13;
B. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.7   Highly mountainous, with rugged terrain and wintery conditions in the Highlands,&#13;
Lesotho depends almost exclusively on privately-operated road transport for internal&#13;
transport. The country has no navigable rivers and no railway except for a short (2 kcm)&#13;
rail link operated by South Africa Railways from the South African border to Maseru.&#13;
Air transport by the local company Lesotho Airways accounts respectively for only&#13;
0.01% and 0.5% of freight and passenger transport. For external travel, Lesotho depends&#13;
almost entirely on RSA's well developed transport system. Because of Lesotho's high&#13;
proportion of migrant workers and low level of marketed domestic production, demand&#13;
for passenger transport is relatively high.&#13;
1.8   The present condition of the transport infrastructure is unbalanced as a result of&#13;
past investments in the transport sector in Lesotho, which have been oriented since 1967&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
towards the primary transit and import/export corridors of the lowlands serving the&#13;
emerging manufacturing sector along the border with the RSA. This has led to relative&#13;
neglect of the transport infrastructure to serve the transportation needs of the Lesotho&#13;
population and large segments of the domestic economy. Most traffic originates and ends&#13;
in the lowlands, and freight is 95% lowlands-based, with the exception of the route to the&#13;
LHWP dam and transfer tunnels sites. This, and limited budget resources, has meant that&#13;
Highlands have been little accounted for in the investment flow.&#13;
1.9   The great majority of road transport trips is made by private transport, and 75% of&#13;
passenger transport is by privately-owned public transport. The publicly-owned Lesotho&#13;
Freight and Bus Services Corporation (LFBSC) accounts for only 0.5% of total public&#13;
transport. Inadequate capacity and lack of accountability of responsible government&#13;
agencies (largely due to the high dependency on, and poor management of foreign&#13;
technical assistance which has prevented the country from successfully developing sound&#13;
institutions and retaining a cadre of skilled staff), poor cost recovery practices, and&#13;
inadequate regulations of transport services, have led to deterioration of the condition of&#13;
the sector.&#13;
1.10  Currently, fare levels are set by the Department of Transport and Traffic (DTT) of&#13;
the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC), on the basis of average vehicle&#13;
operating costs (VOC) and utilization rates which are in fact not well known. This leads&#13;
to distortions in the pricing structure, aggravated by the significant differential margin&#13;
between lowlands and mountainous areas. They are, moreover, reviewed at irregular&#13;
intervals. There is a need for reforming the fare policy to provide for stable prices set on&#13;
a route by route basis, or better to leave fares to the market with an eventual passenger-&#13;
protecting fare cap (with a transparent direct subsidy to the most costly routes to the&#13;
isolated mountainous areas). A key issue is cost recovery of damages imposed onto roads&#13;
by traffic (i.e. users of the road network), hence the need for users being charged for the&#13;
costs of maintenance and rehabilitation.&#13;
1.11  The vehicle fleet is marked by a large percentage of vans and combies (about&#13;
60%) and a low percentage of trucks (10%) and buses (2.5%), and by the use of second-&#13;
hand vehicles from the RSA. Passenger transport operators are mainly single vehicle&#13;
operators (combies) and a few larger operators with up to 100 vehicles. LFBSC has been&#13;
restructured as part of the parastatal reform process, with the freight section of the&#13;
Corporation liquidated, and the bus section retained, although downsized, to serve remote&#13;
areas of the country. The main issues are cumbersome permits administration and&#13;
negative licensing by the Road Transport Board (RTB), which could be resolved by&#13;
granting a licensing authority to the DTT while focusing the Board role on regulating the&#13;
industry, and unregulated army and police vehicles used for paying passenger transport&#13;
with a de facto subsidy.&#13;
1.12  The existing road safety situation is poor. Lesotho's accident rate is ranking&#13;
among the highest by international standards, with a rate of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles&#13;
increasing from 105 in the late eighties to 130 in the most recent years. Police&#13;
enforcement with regard to moving traffic is generally complained about as unfair and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
unreasonable. Road safety measures, either active or passive, are very uncoordinated,&#13;
due to the very meager resources actually spent and the fragmented responsibility&#13;
between MOTC, the Ministry of Works (MOW), and the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police.&#13;
1.13  Axle load surveys conducted as part of the 1994 National Transport Study (NTS)&#13;
show that multi-axle trucks account for the bulk of ESA km/year, and that about 40% of&#13;
those trucks exceeded the current 8.2 tons limit. There is currently no enforcement of&#13;
axle-load regulations, and the two permanent weighbridges near Maseru are not&#13;
monitored. Although the mobile weighscales operated by the RB are appropriate for&#13;
random checking, lay-bys are non-existent and surveys fairly unorganized. Another issue&#13;
concerns the difficulty of raising the axle-load (currently set at 8 tons) to a limit closer to&#13;
the recently adopted 13 tons limit in the RSA following the Southern Africa Transport&#13;
and Communications Commission (SATCC) recommendations. The NTS estimated that&#13;
road damage savings from setting the axle-load limit to a maximum of 10 tons would&#13;
more than offset additional transport costs, as most heavy traffic is limited to lowlands&#13;
corridors and access routes to LHWP sites.&#13;
1.14 GOL's Transport Sector Strategy, defined in the NTS, has four main objectives:&#13;
(i) to support improved access to communities, in particular those living in isolated rural&#13;
areas, and linking district towns between themselves; (ii) to implement adequate taxation&#13;
of transport services; (iii) to enforce traffic control and axle-load regulations; and (iv) to&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity. It emphasizes supporting:&#13;
(a)   reforming the policy and institutional environment, including: (i)&#13;
stimulating participation of the private sector in the sector; (ii) full cost&#13;
recovery (wherever possible) and adequate allowances for funding of&#13;
capital investments; and (iii) coordinating policy-making, planning and&#13;
usage of road transport;&#13;
(b) commencing the development of the institutional, organizational and&#13;
human resources capacity required to effectively plan for, and manage the&#13;
road transport sector;&#13;
(c)   removing the limitations that the present transport infrastucture services&#13;
place on economic activity, by investing in physical ifratucture&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance, focusing investment on improved access&#13;
and increased transport services to mountain communities, and&#13;
implementing road works through methods which favor employment.&#13;
C. THE ROAD SECTOR&#13;
Adminitration of Roads and Maintenance Organization&#13;
1.15  Raponsibility for the management of the road network is divided between three&#13;
agencies: the Roads Branch (RB) and the Labor Construction Unit (LCU) of the Ministry&#13;
of Works (MOW), and the Civil Works Section (CWS) under the Ministry of Local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Govement (MLG).The RB has primary overall responsibility for the classified roads,&#13;
which are the most important and most heavily trafficked roads of the network, and&#13;
bridges. The LCU is responsible for upgrading earth roads to engineered standards, and&#13;
maintaining them using labor-based methods (involving light equipment such as&#13;
pedestrian rollers, water bowsers, tractors). The CWS has responsibility for the&#13;
construction and maintenance of earth tracks and one-lane earth roads. All works carried&#13;
out by CWS are labor-intensive (involving mostly labor and tools), and the roads or&#13;
tracks they construct are to a lower standard than LCU-built roads. The workers are paid&#13;
mainly through the Food for Work Program (FWP), topped with a cash incentive, which&#13;
has attracted a very high percentage of women (estimated at about 80% of the labor force&#13;
in this program). Roads are selected on the basis of populations choices and commitment&#13;
to provide labor. CWS' role also includes the construction of footbridges and clinics in&#13;
the country's isolated areas.&#13;
1.16 The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) is the parastatal&#13;
responsible for the LHWP, which includes the construction and operation of a series of&#13;
dams, hydropower plants, transfer tunnels and pump houses to transfer water to the Vaal&#13;
River Basin in the RSA. Incidental to these massive hydraulic works there has been, and&#13;
will continue to be, a need to construct and strengthen access roads to the dam sites.&#13;
Tlhus the LHDA, which is not a road agency, has de facto temporary responsibility for&#13;
certain road links, including the construction of minor village and district roads. It has&#13;
been agreed, and this is Government's policy, that maintenance responsibility for the&#13;
roads which are currently under the LHDA administration, should be devolved to the&#13;
Roads Branch. The larger issue of maintenance responsibility for different categories of&#13;
roads will be addressed under the Project.&#13;
1.17 The management of urban roads has long been a difficult responsibility and&#13;
financing issue. The experience with the only independent local government, Maseru&#13;
City Council (MCC), showed that limited local financial and technical capacity resulted&#13;
in poor maintenance of urban streets. The institutional arrangements and the nature of the&#13;
works to be undertaken in or around Maseru (and their financial implications) need to be&#13;
agreed upon by all stakeholders on the basis of the expected increase in truck traffic from&#13;
(i) the construction of the Mohale dam and other works under Phase 1B of the LHWP;&#13;
and (ii) traffic generated by the construction of a new bridge at the border in Maseru.&#13;
This issue requires to be tackled within the context of the current decentralization effort,&#13;
and will be partly addressed under this project through the rehabilitation of main corridor&#13;
routes around Maseru, and the eligibility of urban roads for financing from the Road&#13;
Fund on a cost-sharing basis.&#13;
1.18  The road management structure is split between two Ministries (MOW and&#13;
MLG), not counting LHDA (under the Ministry of Natural Resources) which has specific&#13;
objectives. The analysis of the organization charts for the RB and the current rural roads&#13;
organization (LCU and CWS) clearly shows that the road institutional structure is&#13;
uncoordinated, in particular with regard to planning/programming, and operations almost&#13;
fully independent. The present road classification system is less than ideal from a&#13;
functional point of view, and road management, due to its fragmentation between four&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
agencies and three Ministries, is hampered by unclear responsibilities over extensive parts&#13;
of the network and by the fact that a great many LCU and some RB roads have never&#13;
been gazetted. In addition, the classification and numbering of roads are inadequate to&#13;
the evolving situation of the road network, and in particular do not allow road agencies to&#13;
develop a framework to plan, design, construct and maintain their respective networks.&#13;
The RB, as per the Road Act, is the road authority for all roads in Lesotho, and other road&#13;
agencies are operating within a loose legal context. This has resulted in about 820 km of&#13;
rural roads not falling under any agency's responsibility, which means in practice that&#13;
these roads are not maintained, although CWS would have to take the responsibility.&#13;
Government has agreed with the proposal made in the NTS to conduct a functional&#13;
reclassification, and subsequent renumbering, of the network. In parallel, there is a need&#13;
to define mechanisms to register and transfer roads, which would require a revision of the&#13;
Road Act, which is no longer adequate and responsive to present requirements.&#13;
1.19  The RB and the LCU are organized as departments within the MOW, and are&#13;
subject to Public Service regulations. Employment conditions are far from being&#13;
competitive with those offered in the private sector or even parastatals. To address the&#13;
problems raised by the fragmentation of the sector, a proposal to regroup LCU and CWS&#13;
under a department of rural roads in MOW, and the restructuring of the RB with more&#13;
capacity in project supervision and procurement, has been made in the NTS. This&#13;
proposal does not account for the specificity of the CWS (work methods, payment,&#13;
community participation) and the need for better coordination and cooperation between&#13;
agencies. The project will aim to solve these organizational issues through the&#13;
restructuring of MOW and regrouping of all road agencies under its authority. An&#13;
amendment of the 1969 Road Act will be necessary to better reflect responsibilities.&#13;
1.20 The RB has under its wing a Road Construction Unit (RCU) and a Road&#13;
Improvement Unit (RIU), which operate in a very independent and almost contractual&#13;
way with separate budgets and accounts, as well as their own equipment and workshops.&#13;
These units are mainly carrying out all types of work activities on gravel roads, including&#13;
upgrading them to paved standards, and some minor periodic maintenance on paved&#13;
roads. Other RB force account units are responsible for routine maintenance. If the&#13;
maintenance situation is "acceptable" for the RB network, despite relatively high costs, in&#13;
that it is mainly carried out, much of the unpaved LCU and CWS network is not well&#13;
maintained. Regular routine maintenance on CWS and LCU roads has been so far given&#13;
low priority, and little contracting took place despite Government stated policy of&#13;
contracting out maintenance. Very little periodic maintenance activities are carried out&#13;
on gravel roads, with the result that only rehabilitation on LCU gravel roads, mainly&#13;
donor-funded, is undertaken.&#13;
1.21 The Government's Plant and Vehicle Pool System (PVPS), which is under the&#13;
administrative control of MOW and assumes ownership of all mobile plant and vehicles,&#13;
is in serious difficulty: (i) low productivity; (ii) large vehicle fleet with many&#13;
unserviceable items, and scattered plant of which about 50% is not operational; (iii) lack&#13;
of spare parts; (iv) poor management and accountability of the fuel services; (v) lack of&#13;
trained mechanics due to uncompetitive pay scales; and (vi) very few senior management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
staff. This results in operational inefficiencies and high costs, although hire charges are&#13;
regularly revised with regard to those high costs. The policy to service all plant and&#13;
vehicle services through PVPS for a 2.5% service fee (plus an extra charge of 5% when&#13;
services are sub-contracted to the private sector) to cover administrative costs, is highly&#13;
cost ineffective. Its enforcement since last year can only result in PVPS being more&#13;
overburdened and performing its role even less efficiently and effectively, without&#13;
alleviating heavy reliance on private services and facilities, in particular, across the&#13;
border in RSA. The size of the government vehicle and plant fleet is in itself a powerful&#13;
incentive for local garages to expand facilities. The immediate objective should be to&#13;
introduce a degree of competition and restructure PVPS operations and management, and&#13;
do away with equipment and plant in line with the Government strategy to contract out&#13;
civil works, before PVPS privatization or leased management could take place. The RB&#13;
and LCU workshops are small units serving force account units, and could be restructured&#13;
in parallel with the restructuring of these force account units.&#13;
1.22 In addition to the inadequacy of maintenance funding (para. 1.37), road&#13;
infrastructure provision is hampered by poor budgetary planning and programming&#13;
procedures, including limited capacity within MOW, the lack of a monitoring/evaluation&#13;
and financial/fiscal performance control function, and weak project accounting. The&#13;
crucial task of annual programming is currently being developed in the RB, through a&#13;
comprehensive and operations-oriented, road network programming and maintenance&#13;
management tool (Planning Management and Maintenance System-PMMS). This would&#13;
provide a system flexible enough to define rolling plans and annual programs, pending&#13;
capacity to update the road data base and users costs. This system is currently being&#13;
extended to all parts of the network, and is expected to soon become available to all&#13;
concerned agencies.&#13;
1.23 Accounting and financial management capacity is inadequate in both the RB and&#13;
the LCU (mostly manual procedures, financial statements delayed and accounting records&#13;
not kept up to date, no recording of fixed assets, weak accounting and contract&#13;
monitoring of civil works, important control functions such as bank reconciliations not&#13;
carried out, and lack of information for control and monitoring progress). The only&#13;
significant exception concerns contracts financed under donor-funded projects, for which&#13;
accounting and monitoring procedures are gradually being put in place.&#13;
1.24 Lesotho has adopted the SATCC guidelines harmonizing standards and&#13;
specifications. However, there are no detailed design standards and standard&#13;
specifications for all the various road classes and bridges. The LCU prepared a "Design&#13;
Guidelines" handbook for low volume roads and a technical manual for labor-based&#13;
contractors hired under training programs. This was further supported within the&#13;
framework of the current IDA-financed Infrastructure Engineering Credit (IEP). In the&#13;
RB, design standards and standard specifications vary from one project to the other&#13;
depending on which consultants are contracted for design, which results in inconsistent&#13;
standards and, eventually higher costs when roads need to be engineered to higher&#13;
standards. The lack of complete design standards, standard specifications, and quality&#13;
control procedures, results in undue complexity for RB and LCU to properly monitor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
consultants carrying out road works design and supervision. The RB intends to continue&#13;
strengthening its Design Section, and design of rehabilitation works and surveys and bills&#13;
of quantities for periodic maintenance on the RB unpaved roads will be carried out in&#13;
house. However, the capacity for design of rehabilitation and upgrading works remains&#13;
currently weak in MOW, and the few available qualified engineers are needed to take&#13;
over more urgent tasks than engineering studies which can easily be carried out by&#13;
outside consultants, provided that clear design methods and reporting guidelines are set in&#13;
order to harmonize design and ensure comparability and consistency of feasibility and&#13;
design studies. No quality assurance plans are included in works contracts and there are&#13;
no specific quality control procedures, while field laboratories for material testing are&#13;
insufficient. There are neither environmental guidelines for assessing road works&#13;
impacts, except for those developed by LCU for low volume roads, nor any regulatory&#13;
measures for stricter emission standards.&#13;
The Network&#13;
1.25   The 5,200 km long national roads network is relatively extensive, particularly in&#13;
economically active areas. About 2,000 kIn, managed by the RB and LHDA, are public&#13;
("gazetted") roads. Almost all RB and LHDA paved roads are classified as primary&#13;
roads, while most RB and LCU gravel roads are classified as secondary and tertiary&#13;
roads. Most earth roads, as well as roads transferred from CWS to LCU for upgrading to&#13;
engineered standards, are unclassified. The road network is unbalanced in length and&#13;
condition, particularly in the eastern mountainous region of the country. The following&#13;
table shows the network managed by each road agency and surface type, including the&#13;
roads for which no agency takes responsibility:&#13;

1.26 The most recent data on the status of the classified network show that about 23%&#13;
is in good condition, 56% in fair condition, and 21% in poor condition or currently not&#13;
motorable on a regular basis. However, while most paved roads are in good condition&#13;
and very little in poor condition, less than 10% of gravel roads are in good condition. In&#13;
addition, 400/o of unpaved roads as a whole are in poor condition. Low-volume non&#13;
classified earth roads are mostly in poor condition, and most roads not surveyed would fall&#13;
within the poor category, which would result in 43% of all roads being in poor condition.&#13;

1.27 Many roads, in particular those located in the mountainous areas, can only be&#13;
traveled in the dry season, and even then only by four-wheel drive vehicles. As a result,&#13;
accessibility to isolated areas is limited, which restricts the availability of basic services for&#13;
remote communities, mainly located in the poorer mountainous areas of the country. The&#13;
network has started to deteriorate over the past five years, except in those areas servicing&#13;
the LHWP sites which have received special attention, and highly-trafficked lowlands&#13;
tunk routes, for a number of reasons, including: (a) lack of suitable transport sector&#13;
policies resulting in: (i) inadequate arrangements for recovering costs from providers and&#13;
users of transport services; (ii) inadequately planned and sequenced; and untimely&#13;
financing of maintenance in the past; (iii) inefficient planning of capital investments in a&#13;
sector where the prioritization of expenditures has been notably weak; and (iv) ineffective&#13;
use of the private sector; (b) inefficient institutional arrangements for carrying out&#13;
systematic maintenance and upgrading and rehabilitation works; and (c) lack of&#13;
implementation capacity evidenced in a high dependency on foreign technical assistance.&#13;
1.28 Vehicular traffic is currently fairly high on many unpaved roads of the network,&#13;
and traffic grew on average over the period 1988 to 1992 by an annual rate of 6.5%. The&#13;

Human Resources and Implementation Capacity&#13;
1.29 The MOW has had constant difficulty in attracting and retaining engineers,&#13;
technical officers and administrators, due to lack of career prospects and more attractive&#13;
employment conditions being offered by the private sector or even parastatals. These&#13;
unfavorable conditions are prejudicial to staff morale and their attitude to learning new&#13;
operating procedures. This has resulted in acute staff shortages, short assignment&#13;
periods, and constant replacements that have not allowed the development of the&#13;
necessary skills. Both RB and LCU suffer, therefore, from a lack of appropriately&#13;
qualified and experienced staff in complex project design or review, procurement and&#13;
day-to-day project management procedures, and supervision. The many force account&#13;
units use management resources, which could be better employed for such important&#13;
tasks as described above.&#13;
1.30  The rate of staff attrition was very high in the early 90's, but has slowed down&#13;
somewhat during the last couple of years. However, the attractiveness of the RSA market&#13;
is higher than ever, and the plans to decentralize government by creating local councils&#13;
could cause the attrition rate to increase again in the near future, as the new councils&#13;
would need technical expertise and could be able to offer more attractive employment&#13;
conditions than is presently possible for RB and LCU as branches of MOW. In an&#13;
attempt to stop the drain, Government has favored engineers and technical officers with&#13;
salary scales among the best within the public service, discretionary "retention"&#13;
allowances and other fringe benefits. RB and LCU have, however, failed to develop a&#13;
long-term strategy to deal with the staffing issue, largely as a result of the perennial use&#13;
of foreign technical assistance in line management positions (about a third of the&#13;
engineers in LCU, and half of those in RB, are still expatriates), while MOW staff went&#13;
on long-term training overseas, only to join the brain drain from the public to the private&#13;
sector. This has been particularly acute in the engineering area, where foreign technical&#13;
assistance has been considerable and regular for years. The IEP-financed support has&#13;
however enabled some capacity building to take place in the areas of planning and&#13;
programming.&#13;
1.31  The finance sections in RB and LCU report operationally to the Chief Engineer&#13;
and are accountable to the Principal Secretary of the MOW, although seconded from the&#13;
Accountant General's Office in the Ministry of Finance. Movement of staff is done in&#13;
consultation with the line Ministry, but is characterized by high staff turnover, and lack of&#13;
continuity. Many of the staff, who have basic secondary education and no formal&#13;
accountancy training, have, however, some experience in Government accounting.&#13;
1.32 An organization being responsible for the maintenance and administration of a&#13;
road network cannot operate effectively and efficiently when it is constantly understaffed&#13;
(with a significant number of vacant technical posts), has frequently to substitute newly&#13;
graduated staff under bonding for trained staff who have left, employ substantial numbers&#13;
of expatriates, and cannot retain staff due to inefficient bonding arrangements. Although&#13;
employment conditions for engineers and technical officers have been improved as much&#13;
as is possible within the civil service regulations, MOW road agencies still do not have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
the full capacity to handle project accounting and management and lack capacity in key&#13;
functions, and cannot therefore cope effectively with the implementation of the project.&#13;
This dual (retaining staff and staff capacity) constraint will be dealt with under the project&#13;
through a number of measures. The capacity issue cannot, however, be solely addressed&#13;
through direct capacity building actions, and it will also require regulatory reform and&#13;
institutional development.&#13;
The Construction Industry&#13;
1.33  The construction industry in Lesotho is largely underdeveloped. Despite some&#13;
recognition by Government of the potential employment impact of public works,&#13;
implementation is slow, largely due to budgetary constraints. In addition to shortfalls of&#13;
financial resources to contract out road works, the shortage of skilled managerial and&#13;
supervisory staff within the road agencies has hampered implementation.&#13;
1.34 The establishment of a Local Road Construction Industry (LRCI) has started&#13;
under the IEP, focusing on small labor-based contractors carrying out maintenance and&#13;
minor rehabilitation works for the LCU. However, due to the nature of the contracts&#13;
which are currently directly contracted out on the basis of LCU force account unit prices,&#13;
LCU has limited experience in the evaluation and negotiation of contracts, and needs to&#13;
strengthen its supervision and quality control of the contractors' work and conduct more&#13;
regular site inspections. The RB possesses previous experience in contract management&#13;
and administration, as it has used foreign consultants and contractors for a good part of the&#13;
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, and major road construction and upgrading of its&#13;
paved road network. However, supervision of the subsequent works contracts have in most&#13;
cases been taken care of by consultants. The RB has not yet proceeded very far with the&#13;
planned implementation of road maintenance by local contractors (4 untrained truckers for&#13;
small periodic maintenance contracts on gravel roads), and does not have a firm plan for the&#13;
training and use of small-scale labor-based contractors for simple routine maintenance of&#13;
gravel and paved roads. Overall, these new contractors have no technical staff on site when&#13;
their owners are not there themselves. The RB and LCU supervision staff usually find no&#13;
responsible contractor technical staff when inspecting the work sites.&#13;
1.35  Some small local contractors have been unable to obtain Bank guarantees, which&#13;
will create difficulties when recently trained contractors will enter the bidding process.&#13;
The lack of adapted standard documents for small-scale contractors in the RB is one&#13;
constraint to their use by this agency, although those in use by LCU could easily be&#13;
adapted. Payment procedures for local contractors, developed under the IEP, have been&#13;
so far effective. However, increasingly larger numbers of contracts could create&#13;
bottlenecks in the control and payment of certificates, which would create a risk to the&#13;
sustainability of emerging contractors which are usually low on cash and not able to&#13;
withstand long delays of payment. Moreover, delays in equipment repairs are common as&#13;
a consequence of both cash flow problems of the contractors when servicing their&#13;
equipment in private garages, or the inefficiency of PVPS when using hired PVPS&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.36  More emphasis on, and greater cooperation, with the private sector is needed to&#13;
alleviate these bottlenecks. The next step in the promotion of the industry would be for&#13;
GOL to create market incentives, basically by providing a regular flow of works,&#13;
simplifying bidding procedures and provision of securities, and paying quickly. The&#13;
development and implementation by the RB of routine maintenance activities through&#13;
contracting is necessary to help create the competitive market, whereby qualified&#13;
contractors would gradually develop into medium size firms able to take on more complex&#13;
road works. In order to achieve the creation of a local market, GOL ought to eliminate&#13;
those force account units that are redundant and inefficient, and would have to&#13;
restructure, commercialize and, where possible, privatize selected units.&#13;
Financing and Expenditures&#13;
1.37 All road expenditures are paid out from the GOL budget, eventually topped up by&#13;
donors funding. Although capital investments, which are mainly donor-funded, vary&#13;
from one year to another, road expenditures by MOW represented 85% of the 95 million&#13;
Maloti transport sector capital expenditures (themselves amounting to about 28.5% of&#13;
total capital investments for the 1993/1994 fiscal year, excluding the Lesotho Highlands&#13;
Water Project): 66.5 million Maloti were devoted to RB, while LCU accounted for only&#13;
12 million. This clearly shows the strong bias in capital budget allocations towards major&#13;
roads mainly located in the Lowlands. Road infrastructure represented 80% of the 55&#13;
million Maloti transport sector recurrent budget (itself amounting to about 10% of the&#13;
total GOL recurrent budget for the same fiscal year). This illustrates the unbalance&#13;
between investment and maintenance, with the result that funding matches less and less&#13;
the increasing maintenance requirements brought upon MOW. Although the RB budget&#13;
falls somewhat short of planned expenditures, it is by and large adequate to finance&#13;
maintenance (36 million Maloti in FY 1993/1994). The LCU budget (8 million in FY&#13;
1993/1994, or a mere 0.6% of total GOL recurrent expenditures, with about half of it&#13;
devoted to maintenance) is both inadequate in planned and actual expenditures, and has&#13;
been very erratic over the past years, as budgetary constraints result primarily in cutting&#13;
maintenance funds for rural roads. For its part, CWS had estimated recurrent and&#13;
investment budgets of respectively 4.2 and 3.3 million under MHA.&#13;
1.38  This unbalanced and low overall level of recurrent expenditures falls short of the&#13;
necessary funding to meet maintenance requirements, which has resulted in an increasing&#13;
degradation of roads, and increasing impassability of roads to some communities in the&#13;
mountainous parts of the country, and particularly in the Highlands. Moreover, LCU has&#13;
been upgrading and constructing gravel roads in the last 10 to 15 years (about 100 kms&#13;
per year recently), its network has kept expanding, while maintenance has become less&#13;
and less adequate due to capacity and budgetary constraints, which has resulted in an&#13;
urgent need to rehabilitate them. Taking these considerations into account, the emphasis&#13;
of any development program in the sector should be first and foremost on maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation. Upgrading of selected roads should be only considered once recurrent&#13;
financing of maintenance and rehabilitation requirements is ensured and sufficient, and&#13;
priority for upgrading works should be given to regularly impassable roads. Except for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
few limited cases, new capital investments are neither economically viable, nor required&#13;
by network considerations, and the bulk of road construction activities should be carried&#13;
out in rural areas, using the Development Fund and project resources, to benefit village&#13;
communities on the basis of the CAS-supported Government poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
1.39 Government revenues from the road transport sector total about Maloti 89.5&#13;
million per annum (from 1994 figures), mainly comprising of about 84 million, paid out&#13;
to the Ministry of Finance-MOF, from: (i) returns from the Southern Africa Customs&#13;
Union-SACU revenue pool and the General Sales Tax-GST on vehicles and tires, and&#13;
fuel on vehicles and tires, and fuel totaling Maloti 49.1 million; and (ii) fuel taxes (oil&#13;
impost and equalization fund) amounting to Maloti 35 million. The balance comes from&#13;
various fees directly collected by DTT, including motor vehicle licensing and registration&#13;
fees (estimated at Maloti 2.5 million per year on the basis of a first registration fee&#13;
ranging from 100 Maloti to 1,080 Maloti and an annual fee ranging from 30 Maloti to&#13;
920 Maloti), and Road Traffic Administration fees of about 3 million Maloti (0.9 million&#13;
from drivers' licensing, 1.6 million from road transport fees, 0.2 million each from&#13;
vehicle inspection and plates issuance fees). There are currently no toll charges, but&#13;
MOF raises road toll/border fees of about Maloti 1.7 million, and Short-Term&#13;
Permits/Transport Fees (SACU Infrastructure Recovery Charge) on heavy vehicles&#13;
account for about Maloti 1 million.&#13;
1.40 Fuel consumption in million liter per year was estimated by the NTS at 74,&#13;
corrected to 88.4 to account for consumption in urban areas and the RSA. The&#13;
breakdown between petrol and diesel fuel consumption is estimated at respectively 58.5&#13;
and 29.9 million liters, including 5.8 and 3 million tax-free for GOL use. This is a source&#13;
of abuse, and the exemption status should be abolished. Current fuel taxes are as follows&#13;
(the Excise Duty and the Equalization Fund revenues are paid out to the SACU pool,&#13;
which holds these monies in trust):&#13;

1.41   The analysis of Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) versus variable maintenance&#13;
costs shows that heavy trucks are undercharged, hence the need for implementing a more&#13;
progressive licensing fee to better account for damages (the recent NTS and SATCC&#13;
proposals are to dramatically increase heavy trucks annual license fees from the current&#13;
low 900 Maloti per year figure). However, such measures could fall short of raising&#13;
enough revenues for road maintenance and rehabilitation, and do not allow for a&#13;
transparent and full cost recovery of all damages imposed by traffic to the network, which&#13;
would imply that users be charged for the full costs of maintenance and rehabilitation.&#13;
The GST being a general revenue, equity and efficiency concerns suggest a fuel levy (as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
proxy for distance, and hence damages caused to roads), calculated in such a way as to&#13;
limit fuel prices with respect to those in the neighboring RSA in order to avoid evasion.&#13;
In addition, maintenance is currently being revisited to ensure the timely and stable flow&#13;
of funds to road maintenance and rehabilitation.&#13;
Road Sector Development Strategy&#13;
1.42 An improved roads sector has a large facilitating impact on the development of&#13;
the productive base that is essential to growth and a balanced economic development in&#13;
the medium-term. The road sector strategy also constitutes an essential aspect of GOL&#13;
development strategy of poverty alleviation, by providing employment throughout the&#13;
country, based on the maximum use of labor-based methods to carry out road&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance works, and the development of a private construction&#13;
industry. The Strategic Economic Options Report (SEOR), and other initiatives at the&#13;
transport sector level (National Transport Policy, Roads Sector Policy) gave momentum&#13;
to the policy-making process and identification of the key issues faced by the road sector:&#13;
(i) financial (inadequate cost recovery, low overall level of recurrent and investment&#13;
budgets, and biased allocation of expenditures to the different categories of the road&#13;
network); (ii) operational (insufficiently efficient force account units, undeveloped&#13;
construction industry, limited implementation capacity in MOW); and (iii) institutional&#13;
(fragmented structure in too many road agencies, limited planning, programming and&#13;
fmancing capacity at the central government level, lack of a comprehensive and&#13;
coordinated management of the network).&#13;
1.43  The Government is currently focusing on strengthening various implementing&#13;
agencies (and their policy environments) for the delivery of infrastructure services,&#13;
focusing on provision of infrastructure to: (i) promote economic growth through the&#13;
private sector and (ii) reduce poverty and facilitate access to basic and essential services.&#13;
Government's road transport policy addresses the financial, operational and institutional&#13;
issues by primarily focusing on: (i) improving the performance of administrative bodies,&#13;
developing human resources management and career development, and reforming&#13;
operating procedures; (ii) revisiting budget expenditures; and (iii) improving the road&#13;
transport regulatory framework. The policy goals for the road sector are: (i) to increase&#13;
the role of the private sector in road works through the implementation of a sustainable&#13;
maintenance system based on the development of small contractors; (ii) to involve&#13;
communities in the decision-making and financing process relating to rural roads; (iii) to&#13;
improve the efficiency and implementation capacity of MOW; and (iv) to better plan and&#13;
program road works.&#13;
1.44 Long-term development will require (i) the continued and successful&#13;
implementation of a comprehensive manpower development plan; (ii) improvements in&#13;
continuous education to ensure that long-term staffing needs are met; and (iii) changes in&#13;
GOL's personnel and pay policies. While the last point is a general civil service reforn&#13;
issue, QOL is committed to developing a strategy to retain qualified staff in RB and LCU,&#13;
and to ensure an environment that allows road agencies to operate on a commercial basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
One option under consideration is the establishment of a more autonomous Roads&#13;
Authority in Lesotho, independently financed through user charges, and focusing on tasks&#13;
which should remain in Government's hands (design, standards and technical&#13;
specifications, works contracting process, supervision of works and quality control,&#13;
financial management). This would introduce more "commercial" management into the&#13;
roads sector, and strengthen the capacity to retain qualified staff.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM PREvIOuS BANK GROUP PROJECTS&#13;
1.45  There have been four Bank Group road projects in Lesotho. The First Highway&#13;
Project (Credit 82-BL, US$4.1 million, 1966) and the Second Highway Project (Credit&#13;
619-LSO, US$5.5 million, 1976) provided for the construction of main roads. The&#13;
second project also assisted in establishing the LCU on a pilot basis, which turned out to&#13;
be successful in establishing alternative work methods suitable for low-traffic roads. The&#13;
Third Highway Project (Credit 884-LSO, US$9.0 million, 1979) helped establish one&#13;
equipment-intensive and two labor-intensive regravelling brigades and regional offices of&#13;
the RB, and equip the Plant and Vehicle Pool Services (PVPS) regional workshops. The&#13;
Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1481-LSO, US$15.2 million, 1984) assisted in&#13;
strengthening labor-intensive brigades, and provided technical assistance for PVPS.&#13;
However, maintenance continued to be hampered by the lack of sustained operational and&#13;
institutional capacity of the road agencies, largely as a result of the failure to retain&#13;
engineers, and lack of enforcement of axle-load control. One main lesson is that, after&#13;
three decades of supporting the development and restructuring of force account units,&#13;
sustainability had not been achieved due to the remaining inefficiencies in operations&#13;
which could be best performed by the private sector.&#13;
1.46 Implementation of the road sector development strategy commenced with the&#13;
Infrastructure Engineering Project-IEP (Cr. 2400-LSO, US$12.3 million, 1992) due to&#13;
close on June 30, 1996, which focused on capacity building. Progress has been achieved&#13;
in establishing procedures in the Implementing Agencies for allocating available funds&#13;
for investment and maintenance in line with economic criteria, starting to develop a local&#13;
labor-based road construction industry, initiating a training program for the RB,&#13;
developing the administrative and financial management capacity of agencies providing&#13;
infrastructure services, and designing planning and programming systems, and limited&#13;
feasibility studies.&#13;
1.47 The main findings and lessons learned from the previous highway projects and the&#13;
IEP are that, although accomplishments of both the equipment and labor-intensive&#13;
brigades involved in the regravelling and upgrading operations of unpaved roads were&#13;
commendable, it is not possible to sustain the network developed by the brigades with the&#13;
current institutional structure, budgetary constraints, and departmental units such as&#13;
PVPS remaining inefficient. It was also seen that the implementation capacity of the&#13;
roads agencies remains hampered by the loss of engineers trained under the projects to&#13;
the private sector and neighboring countries, despite Government's attempts to provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
trained engineers with incentives to remain in the public sector. This constitutes a clear&#13;
rationale for a drastic reorganization of MOW.&#13;
1.48  Lessons from the Poverty Assessment (Report No. 13171 -LS) led to a special&#13;
emphasis on poverty alleviation through expanding labor-based road works and labor-&#13;
intensive self-targeted earth tracks and footbridges, the latter being achieved by&#13;
decentralizing planning and management to the local level of Government with&#13;
community participation (paras. 4.13 and 4.14).&#13;
1.49 Lessons learned from similar projects in the rest of Africa, in particular from the&#13;
Tanzania Integrated Roads Project-IRP (Credit No. 2149-Tan) and Mozambique Roads&#13;
and Coastal Shipping Project-ROCS II (Credit No 2599-MOZ), have been given full&#13;
consideration in the design of this project, including: (i) using an integrated sector&#13;
approach; (ii) carefully phasing policy reforms and investments; (iii) stimulating the&#13;
development of a local contracting industry through the provision of suitably packaged&#13;
works; (iv) resolving early in the project maintenance funding and organizational issues;&#13;
and (v) emphasizing capacity-building by using short-term TA and local consultants, and&#13;
ensuring transfer of skills to identified counterparts.&#13;
1.50 The Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) has drawn a number of lessons with&#13;
respect to the establishment of sustainable road maintenance in Africa which are reflected&#13;
in the policy initiatives to be undertaken under the project, especially those related to&#13;
financing and management of the road sector.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.1   The primary objectives of the project are to support both continued economic&#13;
growth and the Government's poverty reduction strategy through: (i) developing the&#13;
Government capacity to regularly maintain the whole classified road network by the year&#13;
2000, and upgrade priority roads to improved serviceability standards; (ii) improving&#13;
access to isolated areas and basic services in district centers by facilitating road traffic,&#13;
and lowering transport costs; (iii) further developing the emerging private local road&#13;
construction and maintenance industry, using mainly labor-based methods to generate&#13;
productive employment; and (iv) strengthening the planning, implementation and&#13;
management capacity of the Road Sector agencies, through policy and institutional reforms&#13;
and capacity building support.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.2   One of the specific objectives of the World Bank and IMF-supported adjustment&#13;
program was to link budgetary management to economic planning which includes&#13;
planning for public investments and associated operational and maintenance&#13;
expenditures. Despite progress, this is still needed for the infrastructure sector where the&#13;
provision of funds for maintenance and operations has not been sufficient to secure the&#13;
expected flow of benefits from investments made. The project would support the&#13;
adjustment program and facilitate economic growth by removing road transport sector&#13;
bottlenecks, improving access, expanding manpower development, encompassing more&#13;
private contractors, and promoting efficient resource allocation in the road sector where&#13;
prioritization of expenditures has been notably weak.&#13;
2.3   The Project would be an integral part of IDA's on-going assistance to GOL, which&#13;
aims at facilitating economic development and reducing poverty (para. 1.6). It will focus&#13;
on: (i) implementing regulatory and institutional reforms and strengthening road&#13;
agencies' implementation capacity; (ii) financing priority civil works to ensure&#13;
sustainability in the road sector; and (iii) coordinating donor participation in the road&#13;
sector. IDA will support a program of civil works to improve road conditions and&#13;
address the objectives of the Government 5-year road sector strategy. IDA participation&#13;
in the project would help to: (i) ensure that the road works program is linked to proposed&#13;
policy changes; (ii) manpower development efforts are expanded; and (iii) adequate&#13;
resource allocation to road infrastructure is implemented; and (iii) anticipated&#13;
improvements in policy formulation and implementation, and capacity-building serve as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
reference points for pacing the investment program. The project would also build on&#13;
ongoing initiatives of the Government, supported by the Bank and other donors, and&#13;
provide the opportunity to coordinate and integrate these efforts.&#13;
2.4  IDA participation in the project would help to ensure that it is implemented in line&#13;
with the overarching goal of sustainable poverty alleviation. The project is designed to&#13;
assist a large proportion of poor people (paras 4.11 to 4.13), through: (i) increased access&#13;
to markets and services, at lower costs, in particular for people living in poorer&#13;
mountainous districts having low access to services and being poorly served by the&#13;
current road network; (ii) generation of 2 million person days of work throughout the&#13;
country over the five years, mainly through the labor-based employment-generating civil&#13;
works program; (iii) support the promotion of growth of the Lesotho economy; and (iv)&#13;
resumption of maintenance on those parts of the network (in relatively poorer rural areas)&#13;
which have been neglected in the past. The project would also support the cross-cutting&#13;
policy goals of the CAS through: (i) increasing the role of local contractors; (ii)&#13;
strengthening community ownership through broader participation in the road selection&#13;
mechanism and maintenance works; and (iii) improving the efficiency of management&#13;
and planning of the road sector through capacity building and human resource&#13;
development.&#13;
2.5   The Bank's Infrastructure portfolio in Lesotho comprises two projects, Phase IA&#13;
of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP IA), and the Lesotho Infrastructure&#13;
Engineering Project (IEP). The Project will follow upon the IEP which initiated&#13;
participation of the private sector in road works, the implementation of planning and&#13;
programming procedures, and improved financial and managerial capacity in MOW.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.6   This project finances three major components over the July 1996 to March 2001&#13;
period: (i) a civil works program focusing on maintenance, and including the&#13;
rehabilitation of sections of the RB and LCU network, and selected upgrading of selected&#13;
priority roads; (ii) design engineering and supervision services in support of the program;&#13;
and (iii) sector institutional reform and capacity building, including logistical support to&#13;
MOW. Details are included in the Implementation Manual (para. 3.4).&#13;
Project Strategy&#13;
2.7   The proposed project would aim at assisting Government to implement its&#13;
development strategy and ensure that national objectives are achieved, and coordinating&#13;
donors' involvement in the sector within a common policy reform, institutional&#13;
strengthening, and investment programming framework agreed upon with Government&#13;
(through discrete parallel-financed sub-projects). The proposed project would follow an&#13;
approach that phases the policy reform and institutional development initiatives with&#13;
existing capacity, while supporting the development of the latter, and defines a rolling&#13;
five-year country-wide road investment program, the pace of which would be deternined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
by progress with institutional and policy reforms and improved Government financial and&#13;
implementation capacity.&#13;
2.8   Because of uncertainties associated with Government financial and operational&#13;
capacity to fuly maintain the road network, and to implement key policy reforms, the&#13;
project will focus, during the first two years, on: (i) establishing a sustainable&#13;
maintenance system, while mainly financing road rehabilitation (a few rehabilitation&#13;
works would still be carried out during the third year); (ii) restructuring the institutional&#13;
environment of MOW; and (iii) supporting capacity building. The following three years&#13;
would focus on increased maintenance activities and road upgrading, once the existing&#13;
network has been almost fuilly rehabilitated, and on the pursuit of institutional&#13;
development. A major mid-term review of implementation and institutional progress, to&#13;
be held after two years of project implementation, will assess physical, financial and&#13;
institutional progress, and refine the size of the program for the following three years&#13;
(para. 3.6). Civil works under the project constitute a 5-year rolling program, whereby,&#13;
the details of each year's program, in particular the upgrading of CWS roads, will be&#13;
agreed annually.&#13;
2.9   The 5-year civil works program (about US$ 93.5 million, or 84% of project base&#13;
costs) would include: (i) regular routine and periodic maintenance, estimated to cost&#13;
respectively about US$24.5 million each; (ii) rehabilitating roads in poor condition or in&#13;
need of strengthening, estimated to cost about US$13.5 million; and (iii) upgrading&#13;
selected priority roads costing about US$31 million. Engineering services (assessment of&#13;
bridges and urban roads, detailed design for major road works, and supervision of civil&#13;
works) account for about US$4 million (about 4% of project base costs). The&#13;
institutional reform and capacity building component (about US$14.5 million or 13% of&#13;
project base costs) includes short-term support and limited long-term technical assistance&#13;
for policy and management issues, refurbishing the LCU training center at Teyateyaneng,&#13;
initiating road safety counter measures, and logistical assistance to road agencies&#13;
(laboratory and training equipment, office equipment and supervision vehicles).&#13;
Civil Works Program&#13;
2.10 Given the unbalanced condition of the road network, the civil works program is&#13;
based on an optimum balance between: (i) bringing the network back under regular and&#13;
sustainable routine maintenance, in order to avoid further deterioration by protecting the&#13;
structure of roads, through strengthening maintenance systems and spreading&#13;
maintenance funds more widely on secondary and tertiary gravel roads which have been&#13;
neglected, and including bridges repair where necessary; (ii) rehabilitating gravel roads to&#13;
eliminate the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance before further deterioration takes&#13;
place, strengthening key corridor routes with expected significant increases in traffic, and&#13;
starting road safety improvements; and (iii) gradually upgrading low traffic volume roads&#13;
to provide all-weather all-year round access to isolated mountainous areas, and a few&#13;
selected RB and LCU strategic links. The strategy aims at gradually restoring all&#13;
classified roads to good and fair condition within 5 years (compared to above 90% of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
paved network and about 60% of the unpaved network at present). The most urgent part&#13;
of the program concerns urgent protective routine and periodic maintenance, which will&#13;
require a special operational, organizational and financial effort for the lowest tier of rural&#13;
roads managed by CWS, and to some extent for LCU gravel roads.&#13;
2.11  To support Government's effort to extend maintenance activities, IDA will assist&#13;
with financing periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads on a decreasing basis (para.&#13;
2.46). Road rehabilitation and upgrading works have been phased in such a way that the&#13;
increase in subsequent maintenance funding requirements be gradual. Upgrading to&#13;
engineered gravel standards of CWS roads by LCU is based on "poverty alleviation and&#13;
community participation" criteria (including population preferences, and population&#13;
density) agreed with Government (para. 4.3). The CWS roads upgrading program will be&#13;
prepared by LCU and reviewed by IDA annually with regard to the FWP program and the&#13;
use of the LHWP Development Fund proceeds to match implementation and financial&#13;
capacity. A network rationale has been used to package the RB and LCU rehabilitation&#13;
and upgrading works to ensure that entire links, rather than only limited road sections, are&#13;
brought to good condition. The LHDA plan for upgrading the St. Michael's to Thaba-&#13;
Tseka road and other minor links has been incorporated into the definition of the&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading program. The program has been developed not only taking&#13;
into account priorities, but also considering the implementation and supervision capacity&#13;
of RB and LCU, assessing a reasonable growth rate of local contractors to be able to&#13;
cover all maintenance requirements by the year 2001, and funding availability (local and&#13;
donor, recurrent and capital).&#13;
2.12  The civil works program includes: (i) the gradual implementation of routine&#13;
maintenance on the whole classified network, and periodic maintenance on all sections of&#13;
the classified network in good or fair condition; (ii) the rehabilitation of gravel road&#13;
sections in poor condition that have deteriorated past the point of maintenance to as-built,&#13;
maintainable standards, and the strengthening (rehabilitating to provide a reasonable&#13;
riding surface) of those RB essential/priority road assets (mostly heavily-trafficked trunk&#13;
roads around Maseru); and (iii) the upgrading of key selected rural earth and gravel roads&#13;
to all-weather standards (CWS roads from earth to 3.5-meter engineered gravel standards&#13;
by the LCU), the upgrading of four LCU roads from gravel to engineered 5-meter gravel&#13;
standards by the RB, and the upgrading of four key RB unpaved trunk road sections from&#13;
gravel to paved standards (referred to in the Development Credit Agreement-DCA as&#13;
paving). Annex A provides the details of the road program. The table below summarizes&#13;
the estimated 5-year civil works program:&#13;

Unit costs indicated are average for the three terrain categories: lowlands, hilly,&#13;
mountainous. The implementation strategy is based on contracting out maintenance&#13;
activities increasingly to local contractors, using labor-based methods whenever possible,&#13;
while gradually doing away with force account operations (para. 2.24). A complete&#13;
definition of what are routine and periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading&#13;
activities, and cost figures for each type of roads are included in the Implementation&#13;
Manual.&#13;
2.14  Maintenance activities account for about 44 % of project base costs. The&#13;
minimal-cost rehabilitation program (about 12% of project base costs) includes&#13;
strengthening 57 km of priority paved roads (US$8.5 million), 134 km of RB unpaved&#13;
roads (US$2.5 million), and 196 km of LCU roads (US$2.5 million). The upgrading&#13;
program of about US$3 1.0 million (about 28% of project base costs) covers the priority&#13;
upgrading to engineered gravel standards of about 390 km of CWS roads (US$12.0&#13;
million), and selected upgrading to RB engineered gravel standards of 42 km of LCU&#13;
roads by the RB (US$3.0 million), and about 90 km of gravel roads to be upgraded to&#13;
paved standards (US$16.0 million).&#13;
2.15 In addition, a 1994-1999 US$7.5 million program of labor-intensive works to&#13;
construct and maintain tracks and feeder earth roads, aimed at injecting cash into the&#13;
communities of all districts, is currently being carried out by CWS with support from the&#13;
donor-funded FWP (Food for Work Program) and cash contribution from the GOL&#13;
budget. In order to widen the potential employment impact of civil works, the CWS&#13;
program gives local governments a key role in selecting and carrying out local works.&#13;
The program for the period 1996-1999 covers constructing about 85 km of additional&#13;
roads, upgrading 270 km of tertiary roads and tracks, and an estimated 490 km of&#13;
periodic maintenance and 3,450 km of routine maintenance (or about 1,100 km per year).&#13;
These four categories of works, although mixed in actual implementation, are already&#13;
fully funded for the remaining 1996-1999 period for respective amounts of US$1.1, 2.0,&#13;
1.3, and 1.0 million from the FWP food incentive program, and US$0.6, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.5&#13;
million from the GOL-funded cash contribution program. An additional culverts and&#13;
footbridges program accounts for a total of US$1.6 million. These cost figures are not&#13;
accounted for in the project costing. However, the implementation of the FWP program,&#13;
and the recently started LHWP Development Fund program to upgrade and construct&#13;
village roads on a purely cash payment basis, bear an impact on the organization, mode of&#13;
operations and funding requirements of maintenance activities. In particular, the&#13;
mechanisms to transfer the responsibility of CWS "high-volume" roads to LCU, issues&#13;
involved in regrouping CWS with other road agencies under MOW, the opportunity to&#13;
maintain the food for work basis of the FWP program, and the consistency of criteria&#13;
used in selecting roads and the various civil works programs will be reviewed under the&#13;
project's Institutional Reform sub-component (para. 2.18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
2.16 LHDA-built roads maintenance responsibility will be addressed under the project,&#13;
with an action plan to enforce the current Government's policy to transfer responsibility&#13;
to MOW in 1996, under conditions to be determined as a result of the overall&#13;
restructuring of road management responsibilities (paras 2.21 (b) (iii) and 2.26). The&#13;
evaluation of road maintenance funding requirements accounts for the maintenance of&#13;
these LHDA-built roads under the RB category.&#13;
Engineering Services&#13;
2.17  The project would also include engineering services in support of the civil works&#13;
program worth about US$4.0 million (4% of project base costs) comprising: (i) feasibility&#13;
and detail design studies for upgrading RB gravel roads to paved standards, and design&#13;
for upgrading LCU roads to engineered gravel standards, for an estimated amount of&#13;
US$1.2 million; (ii) engineering studies for rehabilitation works of LCU roads and RB&#13;
paved roads, for an estimated amount of US$0.3 million; (iii) bridge assessment and&#13;
engineering studies for urban roads, for an estimated amount of US$0.4 million; (iv)&#13;
design and supervision of the extension of the Teyateyaneng LCU training center by a&#13;
local consulting firm; and (v) supervision services for major upgrading and rehabilitation&#13;
works which are to be carried out by foreign contractors, for an estimated amount of&#13;
US$2.0 million. Feasibility and detail design studies for rehabilitating and upgrading RB&#13;
unpaved roads (except upgrading to paved standards) will be carried out in-house, as well&#13;
as engineering studies for upgrading by LCU of CWS earth roads to gravel standards.&#13;
Surveys of exact road condition rather than complete feasibility studies will be carried out&#13;
in-house for periodic maintenance. Local engineering firms could be used in studies for&#13;
LCU rehabilitation contracts, and later for supervision of works as their capacity&#13;
increases. External services will be procured through short-term technical assistance&#13;
(estimated at 178 staff-months for engineering studies, and 140 staff-months for&#13;
supervision). The EU would finance the detail design and supervision of the three LCU&#13;
roads to be upgraded to paved standards that it intends to finance.&#13;
Institutional Reform and Capacity Building&#13;
2.18 The Institutional Reform and Capacity Building component (US$14.5 million, or&#13;
about 13% of project base costs) includes two sub-components and logistical support: (i)&#13;
an Institutional Reform sub-component to assist Government in implementing key&#13;
regulatory and policy reforms within the framework of its road sector policy, including in&#13;
particular restructuring the institutional environment of MOW, and establishing&#13;
sustainable road financing mechanisms with the objective of full Government financing&#13;
of maintenance and rehabilitation; (ii) a Capacity Building sub-component aimed at&#13;
developing the organizational and implementation capacity of the road agencies initiated&#13;
under the IEP, through strengthening competencies, and implementing human resources&#13;
management and training actions; and (iii) logistical support to RB and LCU.&#13;
2.19 The comprehensive institutional reform and capacity building component has&#13;
been designed consistently with GOL's road sector policy, and is detailed in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Implementation Manual. It is summarized in the Government's Letter of Sector Policy&#13;
(LSP) setting the policy reforms to be implemented under the project. The LSP signed by&#13;
the Minister of Finance has been submitted to IDA before Board presentation (para. 5.3),&#13;
and is attached in Annex B. The project will be implemented according to the LSP. In&#13;
addition, A Road Fund and a Road Board have also been established (Annex C) before&#13;
presentation to the Board (para. 5.3). This component has been designed to address both:&#13;
(i) the need for key policy reforms aimed at facilitating operations in the road sector; and&#13;
(ii) the implementation capacity constraint, mainly linked to the difficulty to retain qualified&#13;
staff and the need for a sustainable long-term development strategy (para. 1.44). It is,&#13;
therefore, based on concurrent and mutually reinforcing actions detailed below.&#13;
2.20 Given the capacity limitations in MOW, technical assistance is required to ensure&#13;
implementation of the project and to avoid overloading management. However, in order&#13;
to limit the problems associated in the past with long-term technical assistance (LT TA),&#13;
the TA framework has been designed focusing on short-term technical assistance (ST&#13;
TA), reducing LT TA as far as possible (paras 3.10 to 3.12) with a mix of foreign and&#13;
local experts. Foreign LT TA appointments have been limited to assistance to the&#13;
development of a national LRCI (para. 2.25), and project financial and contract&#13;
management (para. 2.34). In addition, eight local long-term consultants (for periods of 2&#13;
to 3 years) to support the RB and LCU regional offices, and project financial&#13;
management, accounting, and contract management, and 2 local trainers for 2 years, will&#13;
be appointed. A total of 322 sm of ST TA will be provided for this component under the&#13;
project (221 staff-months for institutional reform support, and 101 staff-months for&#13;
capacity building), including support to the implementation of road safety and axle-load&#13;
control action plans mostly financed by other donors (57 staff-months) and to the training&#13;
of MOW staff (para. 2.37) and contractors (para. 2.25).&#13;
Institutional Reform&#13;
2.21  The Institutional Reform sub-component would focus on the development of a&#13;
comprehensive restructuring strategy for the sector and the implementation of key policy&#13;
reforms. The project base costs are estimated at about US$7.5 million. Support from&#13;
IDA under the project amounts to about US$3.2 million, with the addition of about&#13;
US$4.0 million for road safety and axle-load control from GOL and tentatively the EU,&#13;
and about US$0.5 million of operating costs financed by Government. IDA's support&#13;
would mainly consist of 106 sm of various ST TA, 48 sm of foreign LT TA and an&#13;
additional two local trainers for a period of 2 years to develop the LRCI, and 58 sm of ST&#13;
TA for training of contractors. The sub-component includes:&#13;
(a)   reviewing and improving as needed the cost recovery mechanisms for&#13;
maintenance expenditures and their management, and securing local&#13;
funding sources for upgrading investments:&#13;
(i)   strengthening the sustainability of the Road Fund through&#13;
appropriate increase of selected road user charges (fuel user fee,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
motor vehicle and heavy vehicle licensing fees, border fees, transit&#13;
fees, and fines on overloaded vehicles) as required to mobilize&#13;
adequate funding for road maintenance purposes, and assessing the&#13;
necessity to give the Road Board more autonomy;&#13;
(ii)  reviewing the conditions of utilization of the LHWP Development&#13;
Fund for road construction investments and the Food for Work&#13;
Program, with regard to the recommendations of the Lesotho&#13;
Poverty Assessment Study to move from a mix of food aid and&#13;
cash incentives to a labor-wage only basis, and the new initiative&#13;
launched by Government to finance rural development projects&#13;
initiated by the Village Development Councils (VDCs, from the&#13;
LHWP Development Fund;&#13;
(b)   restructuring the institutional environment of MOW (which will require&#13;
the revision of the Road Act) including:&#13;
(i)   streamlining and strengthening the organizational structure of&#13;
MOW, through regrouping the three road agencies (RB, LCU, and&#13;
CWS) under a single management (and subsequently&#13;
disbanding/restructuring force accomnt units), strengthening the&#13;
planning unit which has been instated in MOW, and&#13;
restructuring/privatizing PVPS;&#13;
(ii)  strengthening the Local Road Construction Industry (LRCI) in&#13;
parallel with MOW reorganization, through a gradual increase in&#13;
contracting out activities and training of contractors, and primarily&#13;
aimed at small contractors using labor-based methods;&#13;
(iii)  implementing a reclassification of the overall road network,&#13;
including renumbering the network, defining a mechanism for&#13;
gazetting and transferring roads (from CWS to LCU, and LCU to&#13;
RB) according to revised criteria, and allocating responsibility for&#13;
roads currently under the de facto LHDA administration; and&#13;
(iv)  carrying out a study to determine the feasibility and conditions of&#13;
the creation of an independent Road Authority;&#13;
(c)   defming environmental standards, quality control procedures, and adapted&#13;
design standards for road works (including refining the technical and&#13;
procedures manuals produced under the IEP training program), and&#13;
elaborating guidelines setting a common methodology and reporting&#13;
system for engineering studies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(d)   carrying out urgent actions related with road transport policy issues which&#13;
are key to infrastructure (road safety, axle-load enforcement and control&#13;
procedures and legislation); and&#13;
(e)   conducting systematic beneficiary assessments with road users,&#13;
establishing the necessary advisory groups, and involving stakeholders in&#13;
road management through participation in the Road Board, and eventually&#13;
(subsequently) the Board of the Road Authority.&#13;
This sub-component will be implemented through four action plans to: (i) restructure the&#13;
institutional environment of the road sector, including inter alia regrouping the three road&#13;
agencies within MOW, instating a planning unit in MOW, and a strategy for&#13;
restructuring/privatizing PVPS; (ii) developing local contractors and restructuring force&#13;
account units; (iii) implementing road safety actions; and (iv) enforcing axle-load control&#13;
procedures. In addition studies will be carried out during project implementation,&#13;
including inter alia the following three key ones: (i) implementing a roads reclassifying,&#13;
gazetting and transferring mechanism, and allocating responsibility for all roads to each&#13;
MOW agency; (ii) strengthening the Road Fund, determining the feasibility and&#13;
conditions of the creation of an independent Road Authority, and evaluating the financing&#13;
conditions and road selection criteria of the LHWP and FWP programs; and (iii) defining&#13;
and adopting quality control procedures and adapted design standards for road works,&#13;
preparing detailed environmental guidelines and standards for road works, adopting&#13;
construction methods aimed at minimizing possible adverse environmental impact, and&#13;
elaborating guidelines for engineering studies.&#13;
2.22  To ensure the efficient raising and allocation of funds, their timely release, and a&#13;
degree of accountability and transparency, GOL has established a Road Fund, based on&#13;
cost recovery from road users, under the form of a special account opened in MOF.&#13;
Instructions related to its operation, sources of revenue and amounts appropriated for the&#13;
first year -Lesotho FY 1996/7- under the consolidated fund, are under preparation. In the&#13;
short term GOL will focus on ensuring the system operates effectively, funds being&#13;
deposited on a quarterly basis, and withdrawal requiring the signature of the Chief&#13;
Financial Controller in MOF and one official designated by MOW. To ensure&#13;
accountability, management of the Road Fund has been devolved to an independent Road&#13;
Board, where both institutional stakeholders and road users are represented (para. 2.32).&#13;
The Road Board has been appointed by the Minister of Finance, with institutional and&#13;
operating modalities agreed with IDA, and could in the future include representatives of the&#13;
districts. In the medium term, however, a study will be carried out to assess the&#13;
appropriateness of the Road Fund management procedures and revenue sources, the need&#13;
for improved allocation procedures and revenue collection to strengthen its sustainability,&#13;
and implementing recommendations after consultation with IDA (para. 2.27). GOL&#13;
provided assurances at negotiations that they will maintain the Road Board with functions&#13;
and responsibilities satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.6). Specific support could be provided to&#13;
the Road Fund under the project as necessary as part of the assistance to MOW in&#13;
financial and contract management (para. 2.34).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
2.23  This strategy will be implemented in parallel with reforms aimed at restructuring&#13;
MOW and its institutional environment, which Government intends to lead to the creation&#13;
of an independent Road Authority. The first immediate step involves: (a) regrouping all&#13;
road agencies under MOW, and subsequently streamlining operations and the&#13;
organizational structure of MOW (paras 1.18 and 1.19), with 8 sm of ST TA support&#13;
under the project; (b) strengthening MOW in planning, programming, contract&#13;
management, and supervision tasks, in particular through support to the newly-created&#13;
planning unit responsible for implementing a flexible planning framework (with the&#13;
PMMS as an operational programming tool) and a monitoring/evaluation system (paras&#13;
1.22 and 2.35); and (c) restructuring/commercializing PVPS (para. 1.21), with 26 sm of&#13;
ST TA support provided under the project, based on: (i) starting auctioning off PVPS&#13;
heavy equipment and selling PVPS light equipment to local contractors, in line with the&#13;
Government strategy to contract out road works; (ii) transfer vehicles to each line&#13;
ministry with freedom to contract out maintenance; (iii) commercialization of the vehicle&#13;
maintenance services with respect to local private sector capacity, and (iv) reorganizing&#13;
the procurement and management of the fleet under MOF. Government will take all&#13;
measures required to integrate the roads and footbridges section of CWS within MOW,&#13;
and submit an action plan for the restructuring of MOW and the restructuring and&#13;
privatization of PVPS, acceptable to IDA, and to be subsequently included in the&#13;
Implementation Manual, prior to project effectiveness (para. 5.4).&#13;
2.24  An expected second step will consist of privatizing, disbanding inefficient or&#13;
restructuring redundant force account activities (paras 1.20 and 1.36), which would save&#13;
management costs, to be carried out with 8 sm of ST TA support, in the following&#13;
priority order: (i) regrouping of RIU and RCU in the RB, and consolidation and eventual&#13;
privatization of the new unit; (ii) gradual restructuring of selected force account units in&#13;
line with the contractors development program; and (iii) restructuring of RB and LCU&#13;
vehicle and plant maintenance workshops, with respect to the contracting out of regular&#13;
maintenance activities. This step would be conducted in parallel with the implementation&#13;
of the LRCI strategy (paras 4.14 and 4.15), which aims at facilitating contractors&#13;
development (paras 1.33 and 1.36). The extent and the pace of reducing force account&#13;
operations have not yet been finalized, although the action plan for the restructuring of&#13;
MOW indicates the strategy to be followed and commitment from GOL has been&#13;
endorsed in the LSP. General targets for reducing the number of force account units and&#13;
staff have been agreed during negotiations as part of the project monitoring indicators. A&#13;
common action plan to restructure force account units and develop local contractors will&#13;
be included in the Implementation Manual after review prior to effectiveness. The&#13;
actions regarding the retrenchment of staff in force account units will be refined as part of&#13;
the manpower development action plan (paras 2.37 to 2.39) and implemented with&#13;
support from the project in parallel with the MOW training program (para. 2.40).&#13;
2.25  Support to the development of the LRCI focuses on: (i) implementing a&#13;
sustainable maintenance system whereby local contractors using labor-based techniques&#13;
will be progressively taking on maintenance activities; (ii) developing staff from local&#13;
contractors through a comprehensive set of training courses; and (iii) putting into place a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
comprehensive set of measures to support contractors development. The number of&#13;
contractors to be trained has been calculated on the basis of fairly fixed amounts of works&#13;
that they could undertake each year, but increased productivity is expected to occur,&#13;
which will enable competition. IDA's assistance is based upon LT TA (48 sm foreign, 48&#13;
sm of 2 local trainers, and 5 engineers in the regional offices -para. 2.33), and 58 sm of&#13;
ST TA training for local contractors, including continuing the routine maintenance and&#13;
regravelling training courses for labor-based contractors initiated under the IEP (para.&#13;
1.34), extending/adapting courses to benefit contractors who will be involved in RB&#13;
routine maintenance activities, and carrying out courses for upgrading gravel roads to&#13;
engineered standards aimed at local contractors "graduated" from maintenance activities.&#13;
The training program will focus, besides technical aspects, on site management, costing,&#13;
answering tenders, and book keeping. The extension and equipment of the Teyateyaneng&#13;
training center, aimed at accommodating the large increase in training courses for both&#13;
RB and LCU staff and contractors, will be supported by the project (para. 2.40). Various&#13;
measures (para. 1.35) include: (i) access to equipment (with the pursuit of the LCU&#13;
lease/hire system started under the IEP); (ii) simplified standard contracting documents&#13;
for each category of works with adapted technical specifications and simplified payment&#13;
procedures for securities and performance guarantees; (iii) improved accounting&#13;
procedures in LCU and RB to account for different types of operations (routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading); and (iv) appropriate contract packaging,&#13;
and direct awarding to local contractors small performance-related contracts (mostly&#13;
maintenance, but also gradually rehabilitation and upgrading) to be partly IDA-financed,&#13;
and training contracts on a fee basis (para. 3.14).&#13;
2.26  A third step will consist of revisiting the road classification and current road&#13;
management responsibilities, and introducing changes in the Road Act as appropriate.&#13;
This will take place before the planning/programming system is finalized and fully&#13;
implemented, and decisions be made regarding a more autonomous road management&#13;
structure (para. 1. 18). Proposed changes include revising the road classification system,&#13;
with the addition of a fourth class (village access roads), setting out new road gazetting&#13;
criteria and mechanisms for transferring roads falling under road classifications to the&#13;
responsible agency, and registering all non gazetted roads found to belong in the first&#13;
three classes (main and rural road networks). A 10 sm study to define a revised&#13;
functional reclassification and renumber the network accordingly, and elaborate a&#13;
mechanism for gazetting and transferring roads, will be carried out during the first year of&#13;
project implementation. TOR's, to be filed in the Implementation Manual, have been&#13;
agreed at negotiations.&#13;
2.27 The final step would consist of assisting Government in implementing its&#13;
intention, stated in its LSP, to transform MOW road agencies into an autonomous Road&#13;
Authority. The objective would be to create a single commercially-oriented, autonomous&#13;
and accountable National Road Authority (NRA), with management devolved to a Chief&#13;
Executive Officer under the monitoring of the Road Board previously created for the Road&#13;
Fund. Support from the project will be extended to senior management of MOW and&#13;
road agencies to undertake a series of study tours (para. 2.40) of other African countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
to review alternatives and options for strengthening the Road Fund mechanism and&#13;
possibly establishing an autonomous Roads Authority. This, and the revision of the&#13;
gazetting mechanism, would call for revising the 1969 Road Act. GOL provided&#13;
assurances at negotiations that they will carry out, with support from the project (14 sm&#13;
of ST TA), starting no later than March 1997, a study determining the feasibility and&#13;
conditions for the creation of an independent Road Authority, jointly with the review of&#13;
the Road Fund and Road Board functioning (para. 2.22), as well as the evaluation of the&#13;
financing conditions and road selection criteria of the LHWP Development Fund and&#13;
FWP programs (para. 2.21 (a) (ii)). TORs, to be filed in the Implementation Manual,&#13;
have been agreed at negotiations.&#13;
2.28  The need for simplifying and harmonizing standards and specifications, and the&#13;
format of engineering studies and consultancy contracts is crucial at a time when many&#13;
road works will be carried out (para. 1.24). Design standards will be developed on the&#13;
basis of those in force in the region and drawing from the SATCC regional trunk road&#13;
guidelines, suitably amended to reflect the local conditions with respect to geography,&#13;
materials sources, work methods used, etc. In addition, methodology and reporting&#13;
guidelines will be elaborated for consultants carrying out engineering studies, in order to&#13;
harmonize design and ensure comparability and consistency of feasibility and design&#13;
studies. Short-term engineering assistance (14 sm) will be provided under the project to:&#13;
(i) review and elaborate revised road and bridges design standards and standard&#13;
specifications for Lesotho, including refining the technical and procedures manuals&#13;
produced under the IEP training program; (ii) establish quality control procedures; and&#13;
(iii) elaborate environmental guidelines for engineering studies, impact assessments, and&#13;
construction standards (para. 4.18). TORs, to be filed in the Implementation Manual,&#13;
have been agreed at negotiations.&#13;
2.29 There are a number of road transport issues requiring Government decision and&#13;
action (paras 1. 1 0 and 1. 11). The key issues concern the restructuring of the Road&#13;
Transport Board, the reorganization of the Ministry of Transport and Communications&#13;
(MOTC) and the modification of permits issuance, and are highlighted in the National&#13;
Transport Study (NTS). Government is expected to take a decision regarding the&#13;
recommendations of the NTS before Board effectiveness, and prepare an action plan to&#13;
implement key policy reform measures in the transport sector (including in particular the&#13;
mechanism to set domestic fares) during the project execution period, and review and&#13;
redraft as necessary the existing Road Transport Act and Road Traffic Regulations. This&#13;
will be supported from the project with 6 sm of ST TA.&#13;
2.30  Road transport issues related to infrastructure (road safety and axle-load control)&#13;
will be dealt with through two action plans, which will be included in the Implementation&#13;
Manual after review prior to effectiveness. The road safety situation in Lesotho is one of&#13;
the worst in the world (para. 1.12). An action plan estimated to cost about US$3.5&#13;
million, would be implemented in three phases: (i) development of a traffic and accident&#13;
recording form, training of MOW staff and Traffic Police, information, education and&#13;
drivers' training; for an estimated 12 sm of external assistance and US$35,000 of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
equipment; (ii) organization and legislation (Road Safety Board, Road Safety section),&#13;
setting up a computerized accident data base, implementing engineering counter&#13;
measures, continuing training, public campaigns and implementation of signs, and law&#13;
enforcement equipment, for an estimated 28 sm of assistance, US$2.0 million of works&#13;
and US$0.7 million of equipment; and (iii) evaluation, additional training, and further&#13;
equipment for law enforcement, for an estimated 10 sm of assistance, and US$100,000 of&#13;
equipment. Expenditures relative to the first phase will be financed from existing EU&#13;
funds, and the US$2.0 million of road works to improve black spots will be financed&#13;
from the Road Fund. Other phases would be tentatively financed by the EU.&#13;
2.31  Axle load control enforcement procedures are currently weak (para. 1.13). The&#13;
corresponding action plan, estimated to cost about US$300,000 in equipment and lay-bys&#13;
implementation, includes 7 sm of ST TA. It would implement the following measures in&#13;
three phases over the 5-year project execution period: organization of the control between&#13;
traffic police and DTT, selection of control points on roads carrying the heaviest traffic&#13;
(in particular on the border points of the corridors to the LHDA dam construction sites&#13;
and around Maseru), selection and procurement of reliable and accurate portable&#13;
weighscales, installation of facilities at the control points, and establishment of random&#13;
control programs at each point, and training of staff. However, it must be noticed that it&#13;
will be extremely difficult for Lesotho to enforce even a 10 ton load limit when the limit&#13;
in the RSA is 13 ton per axle. This assistance would be tentatively financed by the EU.&#13;
2.32  Systematic beneficiary assessments will be conducted with road users. Popular&#13;
participation in the design and implementation of the low volume rural roads component&#13;
of the project will be strengthened. Beneficiary assessments of road users and&#13;
community representatives, and surveys of stakeholders will be carried out during the&#13;
whole project execution period by local consultants to be recruited under the project&#13;
(estimated at about 4 sm per year). Moreover, road transport stakeholders will be&#13;
involved in road management through their participation in the Road Board (paras 3.6&#13;
and 3.7).&#13;
Capacity-Building&#13;
2.33 A comprehensive capacity-building sub-component has been developed, including&#13;
the following: (i) strengthening MOW implementation capacity, including RB and LCU&#13;
regional offices, focusing on accounting and financial management, supervision of the&#13;
contracting out process (including strengthening of laboratory and quality control&#13;
functions), planning and programming of road works (including traffic counting&#13;
organization and data base updating), and organizing efficient maintenance systems for&#13;
all roads; (ii) elaborating a manpower development action plan with respect to the&#13;
prospective reduction in the large number of expatriates occupying line management&#13;
positions, through instating improved human resources management and career&#13;
development; and (iii) implementing a training program focusing in particular on middle&#13;
level technicians. Support from the project is estimated at about US$5.8 million,&#13;
including US$0.8 million of operating costs to be financed by GOL. It would mainly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
consist of: (i) 75 staff-months of ST TA for MOW strengthening, and 60 staff-months of&#13;
foreign LT TA to be appointed in a central financial and contract management unit&#13;
(FCMU) to be placed in MOW (para. 2.34); (ii) five local contract managers for the RB&#13;
and LCU regional offices (with a role in developing the LRCI), a local contract manager&#13;
for the LCU Headquarters, and a local accountant and a local financial controller to be&#13;
appointed as counterparts to the FCMU foreign experts, all for a period of 3 years; and&#13;
(iii) training (ST TA for an estimated amount of 26 staff-months, extension of the&#13;
Teyateyaneng training center, and US$0.8 million in support to training). In addition,&#13;
Irish Aid is financing respectively two and one engineers in advising positions in the RB&#13;
and LCU until December 1997.&#13;
2.34 Measures to improve the limited capacity of Implementing Agencies to handle the&#13;
financial management, accounting, and contract management functions of the project&#13;
(paras 1.23 and 1.31), in addition to strengthening non project-specific procedures in this&#13;
area, will focus primarily on the central level of MOW, in particular the finance sections&#13;
of RB and LCU. This objective is concurrent with the need to manage the sector in a&#13;
more integrated manner (para. 1.22) and the strengthening of the planning unit in MOW&#13;
(para. 2.23), so that assistance under the project will include both: (i) supporting&#13;
accounting, financial management, and contract monitoring capacity; and (ii)&#13;
strengthening budgetary, planning and programming procedures for the roads sector. A&#13;
Financial and Contract Management Unit (FCMU) will be created and financed under the&#13;
project, and will be staffed with foreign Financial and Contract Managers respectively for&#13;
3 and 2 years, and a local Financial Controller and a local Accountant for 3 years.&#13;
Evidence of the recruitment of these four staff would be submitted to IDA prior to&#13;
effectiveness (para. 5.4). Additional ST TA (8 sm) will also be provided under the&#13;
project, when the FCMU would have become fully autonomous and Basotho-run, and&#13;
could be extended as necessary to the Road Fund pending the recommendations of the&#13;
study of the Road Fund functioning (para. 2.27). The assistance will focus on&#13;
strengthening and decentralizing the IEP-initiated accounting, record keeping and&#13;
financial management procedures, establishing contract monitoring systems and&#13;
consolidated monthly project cost reporting systems, and continuing the IEP-started&#13;
training of road agencies staff in project reporting (forms of contract and contract&#13;
conditions, disbursement forms) and financial management (para. 3.2). A time-bound&#13;
program, aimed at improving capacity in these areas will be defined as part of the work&#13;
program of the FCMU team when it will be contracted or right after mobilization.&#13;
2.35 Support will be extended to strengthen the newly-created planning unit in MOW,&#13;
which will be responsible for coordinating road programming. This unit could in time be&#13;
turned into the financial and planning unit of the Road Authority if and when created.&#13;
Assistance to planning and programming will take the form of ST TA for an amount of&#13;
27 sm to: (i) consolidate the PMMS system with the elaboration of additional modules&#13;
(unit cost, traffic counting) and ad-hoc assistance to conduct traffic counts and condition&#13;
surveys and operate the system; and (ii) assist the planning unit in budgeting for all&#13;
capital projects, and developing maintenance programming procedures to be implemented&#13;
by regional engineers after on-the-job assistance and training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
2.36 Proper management of the project requires some strengthening of the&#13;
Implementing Agencies in day to day operational management, procurement,&#13;
reporting/filing, contract monitoring and supervision (paras 1.33 and 1.34). Support to&#13;
MOW implementation capacity will therefore also consist of: (i) additional TA in both&#13;
RB and LCU (five local contract and supervision engineers in the regional offices for a&#13;
period of two years, with a specific role in developing the local road construction&#13;
industry, and a senior contract engineer to assist LCU in managing the heavy load due the&#13;
significant increase in road works to be carried out in rural areas); and (ii) 12 sm of ST&#13;
TA to implement comprehensive maintenance systems in the districts, and assist in CWS&#13;
reorganization after its integration within MOW.&#13;
2.37  Key actions to be undertaken in the short-term to enable road agencies to retain&#13;
staff (para. 1.30) are: (i) to implement a professional development program for those RB&#13;
engineers who received scholarships under the IEP, and review procedures to enforce&#13;
bonding agreements and repayment of training fees by staff having benefited from long-&#13;
term training overseas; (ii) to elaborate a plan to reassign engineers to vacant positions, or&#13;
to specific projects, and rotating them through positions of increasing responsibility&#13;
within MOW upon their return from training; (iii) to implement an internal functional&#13;
reorganization to give staff more rewarding operational tasks, in parallel with the MOW&#13;
restructuring effort and the reduction of force account units(paras 2.23 and 2.24); and (iv)&#13;
developing a manpower development action plan for MOW aimed at defining a human&#13;
resources strategy, including the necessary retrenchment of force account operational&#13;
staff and the recruitment of specialized qualified staff to fill vacant positions and replace&#13;
dwindling TA occupying line management positions. This will be supported under the&#13;
project with 28 sm of ST TA, and be supplemented by a training program for the&#13;
generally insufficiently qualified staff (para. 2.40). Submission by GOL of a long-term&#13;
plan to assign staff members trained in the course of their assignment with MOW to&#13;
positions commensurate with the responsibilities they were trained for, including&#13;
evidence of the reassignment of stafftrained under the IEP upon their return, is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.4). Assurance has been provided by GOL at&#13;
negotiations that they will elaborate prior to the mid-term review, and implement during&#13;
the project execution period, a manpower development action plan (para. 5.6).&#13;
2.38  Staff, who will be primarily affected by the disbanding of force account units are&#13;
mostly non permanent laborers currently scattered in the field (except for PVPS). This&#13;
will minimize the impacts of staff retrenchment, as it is expected that those workers&#13;
would constitute a reservoir of labor for the local contractors who will carry out the bulk&#13;
of the maintenance works. While the long-term policy is being defined to retain staff&#13;
within MOW as part of the manpower development action plan, other short-term&#13;
measures, such as short-term training of permanent staff and the provision of supervision&#13;
vehicles, will be implemented. In particular, permanent staff of the force account units&#13;
are mainly technical officers, technical assistants and laboratory assistants, who will&#13;
undergo extensive training to acquire the required skills to carry out the main tasks of&#13;
supervising works and monitoring the network condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
2.39 The manpower development strategy aimed at addressing the capacity issue (para.&#13;
1.29) will be based upon assessing the necessary evolution of staff skills vis a vis current&#13;
staffing profiles, training needs, and new organizational requirements to take place in&#13;
MOW in line with GOL's policy to increase contracting out. Support (12 sm of ST TA)&#13;
will be provided for the evaluation of training needs and skill gaps (including a list of&#13;
potential trainees, evaluation of their skills deficiencies vis a vis their tasks, analysis of&#13;
the job descriptions and staff workload, linkage between such analyses and content of&#13;
courses, training modalities, timetable for training programs) vis a vis MOW development&#13;
objectives.&#13;
2.40  A staff training program will be included in the project, based on short-term&#13;
Lesotho-based training in design, environmental assessment, quality control, works&#13;
supervision, accounting and financial management methods, and investment decision-&#13;
making techniques. A draft training program will be prepared with support form the IEP,&#13;
and be submitted to IDA prior to effectiveness (para. 5.4). Further analysis of training&#13;
needs, in particular for the senior LCU staff who did not benefit from any IDA-funded&#13;
training under the IEP, will be conducted at the onset of the project. A permanent Training&#13;
Division (responsible for all road training activities) could be created in MOW under the&#13;
project. The project support will take the form of: (i) 14 staff-months ST TA to prepare&#13;
and coordinate training short-term programs; (ii) training courses, study tours and&#13;
regional fellowships (US$ 350,000); and (iii) extending the training capacity at&#13;
Teyateyaneng (design and supervision, civil works estimated at US$350,000, and&#13;
US$150,000 of training equipment). The Teyateyaneng training center will be mainly&#13;
used for contractor training, but also for requalification courses for MOW staff.&#13;
Logistical Support&#13;
2.41  An estimated additional US$0.9 million would be provided for logistical support&#13;
to RB and LCU, including (i) office equipment, mainly related to the financial and&#13;
contract monitoring aspects, as MOW will require appropriate computer hardware and&#13;
software, such as computerized accounting packages or Dbase programs (para. 3.4); (ii)&#13;
vehicles for works supervision; and (iii) laboratory and quality control equipment.&#13;
D. PROJECT COST&#13;
2.42  The five-year project (including physical and price contingencies) is estimated to&#13;
cost US$129 million, of which about 56% would be in foreign exchange. Of the base&#13;
costs of about US$112 million, about US$18.5 million would be for institutional support&#13;
and engineering services (including US$0.9 million in logistical support), which are all&#13;
IDA-financed except about US$4 million for road safety and axle-load measures&#13;
(including US$2 million in road safety works and US$1.1 million in equipment), and&#13;
US$93.5 million allocated to civil works (including about US$49 million for the 5-year&#13;
maintenance program mostly financed by GOL). Road works costs have been calculated&#13;
including unidentified taxes and duties. Price contingencies of about US$7.5 million, or&#13;
about 7% of base costs, have been included at rates of 2.6 % for the period based on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
expected US$ inflation rates. Physical contingencies of about US$10 million (about 9%&#13;
of base costs) have also been included. A summary cost table is included below, and&#13;
detailed cost estimates are shown in the two tables of Annex D.&#13;

2.43    Cost estimates are based: (i) for road works, on PMMS unit costs revised as per&#13;
the latest local and regional contracts and a collection of Lesotho data; and (ii) for&#13;
equipment, TA and training on recent quotations. Base costs are based on current prices&#13;
as of July 1995. The average rehabilitation costs have been respectively estimated for&#13;
paved and gravel roads. The average upgrading costs per km have been estimated&#13;
respectively for LCU gravel standards, and RB gravel standards and paved standards. Unit&#13;
costs for maintenance of LCU roads -provided by LCU- appear high, a result of the&#13;
relatively high cost of labor which accounts for a large share of the cost under the labor-&#13;
based works, and will be annually reviewed. Routine and periodic maintenance costs on&#13;
CWS roads have been estimated from figures of the FWP program and CWS rates. Costs&#13;
are expected to decrease due to increased competition between contractors, which would&#13;
mean additional capacity to fund upgrading works for which a financing gap may exist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
E. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
2.44 GOL will contribute about US$64.5 million equivalent (about 50 % of the total&#13;
project costs ) for local project expenditures, including maintenance and operating costs.&#13;
Total external financing is estimated to be about US$64.5 million. With IDA providing&#13;
US$40.0 million, which would finance about 31 % of the total project costs, parallel co-&#13;
financing of US$24.5 million will be needed for the remaining 19 % of total project costs.&#13;
In the event that other donors cannot commit to the full requirement, GOL would finance&#13;
the additional cost, or the upgrading program would be scaled back after the mid-term&#13;
review. The detailed financing plan is in Annex E. A summary of the financing plan for&#13;
IDA and other potential donors likely to participate in the project is summarized below:&#13;
Summary Financing Plan&#13;
(USS million)  Local     Foreign  Total    %&#13;

Total        |56.8      72.2      129.0   100%/0&#13;
2.45 All maintenance works and about 85% of rehabilitation and upgrading works are&#13;
fully funded. To match capital investments with GOL's capacity to fund their subsequent&#13;
maintenance, the upgrading works program, mostly planned for implementation during&#13;
the outer years of the program, will be revisited at the mid-term review, and its&#13;
implementation paced with progress in policy reforms, implementation capacity, and&#13;
maintenance funding (paras 3.6 and 3.24). Full sustainability of Government funding for&#13;
road maintenance will be achieved from user charges at the end of the project period.&#13;
Foreign Funding&#13;
2.46 The proposed IDA credit of US$40.0 million would finance various parts of the&#13;
project. IDA will support Government effort during the project life by: (i) financing&#13;
periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads (para. 2.11) on a decreasing basis from&#13;
50% in 1996/1997 to 20% in 1998/1999; (ii) funding a large share of rehabilitation&#13;
projects at 70 % of contract costs; and (iii) funding in priority order the upgrading of&#13;
CWS roads and selected RB and LCU roads, at 90% of contract costs, at a pace matching&#13;
the financial and institutional capacity to operate and maintain such investments. IDA&#13;
will finance selected LCU and CWS periodic maintenance contracts, with GOL fully&#13;
financing the remainder, such that GOL finances respectively 50% and 80% of the total&#13;
periodic maintenance of LCU and CWS roads in 1996/7 and 1998/9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
2.47 About US$24.5 million will be required in parallel financing from the donor&#13;
community. Irish Aid is already committed to finance US$1.7 million equivalent.&#13;
Pending the conclusions of the upcoming negotiations between the EU and GOL&#13;
regarding the eighth European Development Fund (EDF) allocation for Lesotho, the EU&#13;
has indicated that US$17.0 million could be secured for civil works, and that about&#13;
US$2.0 million of additional funds could be mobilized to help finance the US$4.0 million&#13;
road safety and axle-load components. Existing EU funds could finance the first phase of&#13;
the road safety and axle-load components. A firm commitment can only be made when&#13;
these negotiations are finalized, which is expected to be by October 1996. KfW will be&#13;
reviewing its program in 1996, and would reallocate about US$0.8 million of residual&#13;
finds to rehabilitating or upgrading LCU roads, and could further allocate from US$1.5&#13;
to 4.0 million to civil works, which would cover the existing US$4.0 million to be funded&#13;
by other donors. This would leave no financing gap or a small financing gap, which, if&#13;
no other donors can be brought in, would have to be financed by GOL or eliminated&#13;
through a reduction in the upgrading program.&#13;
Local Funding&#13;
2.48 Annual domestic funding requirements, for both the maintenance of the network&#13;
and the local counterpart funding of the rehabilitation and upgrading program have been&#13;
quantified. GOL is committed to increase allocations for road maintenance over the five-&#13;
year project period so as to domestically fund all maintenance requirements by 2000.&#13;
GOL will finance 100% of road routine maintenance and periodic maintenance of RB roads&#13;
over the life of the project, and an increasing share (50% to 100%) of LCU and CWS roads&#13;
periodic maintenance (para. 2.46). This will amount to about US$49.0 million, over the&#13;
five years, including about US$9.0 million in each of the first two years. Road maintenance&#13;
funding requirements will stabilize at about US$11.5 million per annum by 2001 after&#13;
project completion. GOL will also finance bridge maintenance and road safety&#13;
improvements from the Road Fund, provide an average of about US$1.5 million per annum&#13;
as local contribution towards the capital costs of the project (including counterpart funds for&#13;
rehabilitation from the Road Fund), and finance operating costs for various activities under&#13;
the training and manpower development, local road construction industry development, and&#13;
institutional reform components.&#13;

2.50 From the beginning of 1996, the Road Fund will be financed through a fuel&#13;
charge of Lisente 39 per diesel liter (about 11 US cents) and 31 per petrol liter (about 9&#13;
US cents). For 1996 it is estimated that Maloti 38 million (about US$10.5 million at the&#13;
year end exchange rate) would be sufficient to finance planned maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation expenditures, including bridge maintenance and road safety counter&#13;
measures (counterpart funds for upgrading works would come from the general budget).&#13;
2.51   Various assurances have been sought from GOL in connection with this financing.&#13;
Evidence, acceptable to IDA, that GOL has allocated adequate funds to road maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation in the FY 1996 Finance Budget, is a condition of effectiveness for this&#13;
credit (para. 5.4). GOL has provided assurances at negotiations (para. 5.6) to: (i) allocate&#13;
and disburse adequate and timely annual funding for the project through the Road Fund,&#13;
and use its proceeds only for maintenance and rehabilitation; and (ii) undertake no later&#13;
than March 1998 a study of the operations of the Road Fund, on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and implement its recommendations as agreed with IDA (para. 2.22).&#13;
Changes to the structure of the Road Fund, which could adversely impact the efficient&#13;
and accountable financing of road maintenance, would only be done after prior&#13;
consultation with IDA.&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.1  In order to maximize capacity building, the project would be implemented by the&#13;
MOW, with RB, LCU and CWS having management responsibility for the road&#13;
programs. No new agencies would be created at project inception, but MOW would be&#13;
restructured under the project, and Government has committed in its LSP to transform&#13;
road agencies into an autonomous Road Authority (para. 2.27). However, institutional&#13;
development under the Project is complex, and will require a Project Coordinator to&#13;
coordinate the various actions. The Project Coordinator will be nominated by the&#13;
Minister of Works, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of&#13;
Economic Planning (MEP), from among senior staff in MOW by no later than project&#13;
effectiveness, and report to the Minister of Works. The policy reform and institutional&#13;
development process involves other key stakeholders, such as the MEP, MOF, MOTC&#13;
and Traffic Police. A Project Coordinating Committee, headed by the MOW Project&#13;
Coordinator, and including the Senior Economic Planner in charge of Infrastructure in&#13;
MEP, the Chief Financial Controller in MOF, the RB and LCU Chief Engineers, the&#13;
CWS Senior Engineer, the Director of the MOW Planning Unit, the Financial Manager of&#13;
the FCMU (para. 2.34), and the DTT Commissioner of MOTC, will be created and have&#13;
overall responsibility for monitoring the road sector policy reform process. Other&#13;
personnel could be appointed as deemed necessary by GOL. The Project Coordinator&#13;
(who was to be nominated before project effectiveness -para. 5.4) and the Project&#13;
Coordinating Committee have already been appointed. MEP would have particular&#13;
responsibility for ensuring proper implementation of sector policies within the framework&#13;
set out for the infrastructure sector in the SEOR (paras 1.41 and 1.43).&#13;
3.2  In order to be able to meet the accounting, financial and contract management&#13;
requirements of the project, MOW will strengthen its capacity, with the support of a&#13;
Financial and Contract Management Unit (FCMU), attached to MOW (para. 2.34). The&#13;
unit will carry out the tasks of accounting, record keeping and financial management,&#13;
contract monitoring and establishing consolidated monthly cost reports, and carrying out&#13;
the requisite training for concerned personnel in MOW (para. 2.35). Due to the limited&#13;
capacity in the implementing agencies to handle financial matters, the FCMU will in&#13;
addition be responsible for managing the project accounts and disbursements (para. 3.23).&#13;
The unit will also interface with the Road Fund by assisting in the design and&#13;
implementation of appropriate procedures for the financial and budgetary management of&#13;
roads. Support from the Project will be based on the recruitment of a Financial Manager&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
and a Contract Manager (long-term technical assistance of respectively 3 and 2 man-&#13;
years). In addition fully professionally qualified local counterparts (Accountant and&#13;
Financial Controller) would be recruited on a contract basis by MOW. The IDA credit&#13;
would finance an initial period of 3 years, before direct employment can be secured by&#13;
MOW through the Road Fund or the NRA. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations&#13;
that they will maintain the FCMU throughout the project execution period (para. 5.6).&#13;
The recruitment of the four FCMU staff (Financial Manager, Contract Manager,&#13;
Financial Controller, Accountant would take place prior to effectiveness (para. 5.4), and&#13;
the beginning of services is expected to be as of July 1996.&#13;
3.3   A Project Launch Workshop will be carried out. Project Implementation&#13;
supervision will be carried out through annual reviews, based on agreed criteria and&#13;
procedures to evaluate progress and revise road programs and action plans as necessary.&#13;
In addition, a comprehensive mid-term review would be undertaken by the end of the&#13;
second year of project implementation, to assess implementation progress, in particular&#13;
vis a vis achieved institutional and financial reforms, and determine the scope and pace at&#13;
which upgrading investments would be made in the outer years of the project. GOL has&#13;
provided assurances at negotiations that they will conduct a comprehensive mid-term&#13;
review by no later than March 1998, and annual project reviews with IDA and other&#13;
participating donors around March of each year, starting one year after effectiveness, and&#13;
will carry out the recommendations of these reviews as agreed with IDA (para. 5.6).&#13;
3.4   Key monitorable indicators of successful physical and financial implementation&#13;
have been developed to measure implementation success, and progress at the institutional&#13;
level will be monitored through completed studies, action plans' achievements, and&#13;
regular progress reports (para. 4.9). Project performance indicators (para. 4. 10) have&#13;
been agreed at negotiations. CPM will be used for IDA monitoring of the project. A&#13;
detailed Project Implementation Manual, an index of which is included as Annex F, has&#13;
been prepared by GOL, and will be updated for each annual review. It includes all&#13;
documents used in the project preparation, except for the processing documentation&#13;
(IEPS, FEPS, authorization memoranda, and comments, which are included in Bank&#13;
files). Its primary audience is the implementing staff themselves. Receipt of evidence&#13;
that GOL has adopted a Project Implementation Manual acceptable to IDA will be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.4). Summaries of the institutional and physical&#13;
implementation plans are in Annexes G and H respectively, and have been agreed at&#13;
negotiations. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that they will implement the&#13;
project in accordance with the implementation program (para. 5.6).&#13;
3.5   The annual reviews will evaluate the status and performance of the project over&#13;
the previous year, on the basis of the measure of the performance indicators, after&#13;
adequate and proper data collection has been conducted. The following aspects will be&#13;
reviewed in particular: (i) Institutional Reform policy actions, and progress in instituting&#13;
a coherent legal and regulatory framework, in particular with respect to the road funding&#13;
recovery and allocation mechanisms; (ii) effectiveness of the Capacity Building sub-&#13;
component; (iii) measures to ensure efficient utilization of TA, including appropriate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
transfer of technology to local counterparts; (iv) detailed upgrading, rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance targets (km achieved in various categories), and procurement arrangements;&#13;
(v) funding level (financial costs and disbursement targets); and (vi) annual surveys of&#13;
road users and other stakeholders, in particular communities benefiting from the&#13;
upgrading of rural tracks (para. 2.32). Four weeks prior to each review, GOL will submit&#13;
to IDA in preparation for the review a report covering performance over the past year and&#13;
a draft action plan to address pending issues. Road programs will be defined in&#13;
accordance with the undertakings set out in the LSP, and mutually agreed between GOL&#13;
and IDA at each annual project review. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that&#13;
the detailed road programs for each year will be defined: (i) on the basis of the road&#13;
selection criteria (para. 4.3) agreed with IDA at negotiations and included in the LSP; (ii)&#13;
with regard to progress as measured through the project performance indicators; and (iii)&#13;
provided that financing has been secured, and design -including satisfactory&#13;
environmental analysis- has been completed (para. 5.6).&#13;
3.6   The mid-term review, to be conducted no later than March 1998, will assess&#13;
progress with the proposed institutional, capacity building, financial, and physical&#13;
requirements, set out Government financial and managerial capacity to implement the&#13;
upgrading program in the following three years of the project, and eventually restructure&#13;
the project as appropriate (para. 2.45). It will cover the same issues as in the annual&#13;
reviews, and include a detailed assessment of the substantial completion of specific&#13;
institutional, policy and implementation actions listed in Annex I. It will in particular&#13;
focus on the following aspects: satisfactory completion of the first two years maintenance&#13;
program (funding and kilometers having undergone actual maintenance work as per&#13;
targets agreed at negotiations), progress of the Institutional Reform action plans,&#13;
implementation of human resource initiatives and TA performance, and elaboration of&#13;
detailed environmental guidelines satisfactory to IDA. Thereafter, annual reviews of&#13;
progress will determine the details of the following year program.&#13;
3.7   Taking measures to develop capacity in MOW and restructure road management&#13;
will not suffice to achieve sustainability, without strengthened ownership and enhanced&#13;
participation of road users and Village Development Councils (VDCs) representing local&#13;
populations in the decision-making process (para. 2.32). Populations will play a&#13;
significant role in the design, priority setting and implementation of the low volume rural&#13;
roads component of the project through: (i) accounting for VDCs' priorities and&#13;
population density in the selection of rural feeder roads to be upgraded to all-weather&#13;
standards, as agreed with Government (para. 4.3); (ii) direct selection by local&#13;
communities of roads and footbridges to be funded under the LHWP Development Fund&#13;
program, (iii) involvement in maintenance and rehabilitation of village roads, through&#13;
labor-based works paid for in cash, and to be increasingly financed from the Road Fund&#13;
on a cost-sharing basis; and (iv) food aid from the FWP program managed by the CWS&#13;
section. The use of labor-based methods in most works on rural roads is adapted to rural&#13;
areas lacking technical skills, and maintenance will greatly benefit from the involvement&#13;
of populations on their roads. Monitoring of success at the user level in the communities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
is complex, but will be assessed vis a vis baseline data (traffic, deterioration, transport&#13;
access) and regular beneficiary assessments.&#13;
3.8   Road users will be involved in road management through participating in the&#13;
Road Board (para. 2.32), which is currently being established, and eventually in the&#13;
subsequent Board of the Road Authority. The Road Board consists of eleven members&#13;
and a chairman who have been appointed by the Minister of Finance, with six members&#13;
being representatives from Government and five representatives from non-government&#13;
organizations (including the Lesotho Bus and Mini-bus Operators Association, and the&#13;
Lesotho Transport Association). Advisory groups, on such matters as road safety,&#13;
environment, engineering, and funding, and headed by Board members to facilitate the&#13;
work and functions of the groups, would comprise designated members (or nominated by&#13;
different constituencies having a special interest in the matter). To evaluate the extent to&#13;
which the needs of the contracting, consulting, and transport industries are being met by&#13;
the project, roadside surveys, surveys of taxi and truckers associations, and surveys of its&#13;
sector affiliates by the Lesotho Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) will be&#13;
undertaken annually. These surveys will form part of the annual review to keep the&#13;
project well focused, and representatives of the Board will participate in the reviews.&#13;
3.9   The IDA Credit is expected to become effective by April, 1996. The project&#13;
should be physically completed by June 30, 2001, and the project's closing date would be&#13;
December 31, 2001.&#13;
B. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
3.10  Fragmented and poorly coordinated long-term technical assistance, and excessive&#13;
use of long-term foreign expatriates in line management positions to substitute for&#13;
qualified staff (particularly at the management level) that Government proved unable to&#13;
retain, result, now that foreign assistance is dwindling, in limited local capacity in MOW&#13;
(para. 1.28). There is a clear consensus among donors not to maintain the current levels&#13;
of LT TA, and to implement new solutions to secure implementation capacity (para.&#13;
1.30). LT TA has, while major restructuring reforms are gradually carried out, been&#13;
limited to the minimum necessary to meet the short-term requirements of&#13;
implementation, avoid delays, and enhance the current implementation capacity (para.&#13;
2.19).&#13;
3.11  The structure and role of LT TA in implementation has been designed to&#13;
maximize capacity building and ensure that it builds rather than destroys capacity, by&#13;
using it solely for institutional development and capacity building purposes, phasing out&#13;
foreign assistance (amounting to about US$1.7 million for 108 staff-months) as soon as&#13;
possible, and using local expertise whenever possible (support to regional offices,&#13;
trainers, counterparts to Financial Manager and Contract Manager, for a total amount of&#13;
about US$1.2 million and 300 staff-months). Its effectiveness will be closely supervised,&#13;
through clear terms of reference, detailed task work-plans for the teams and each expert&#13;
and counterpart, periodic monitoring of skill transfer performance and quarterly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
reporting, counterpart training, and on the job training for returning graduated engineers&#13;
trained under the IEP. Terms of reference for key studies and consultancies have been&#13;
agreed at negotiations. Monitoring the performance of consultants' services financed&#13;
under the Project will be carried out in accordance with evaluation criteria to be agreed&#13;
with GOL prior to effectiveness.&#13;
3.12    The assistance strategy focuses on utilizing short-term  technical assistance to&#13;
compensate for the diminishing number of long-term expatriates, gradually introducing&#13;
greater use of local consultants (for example in LCU for small contractors training&#13;
purposes), and training personnel on the basis of short-term courses open to the largest&#13;
number of technicians and engineers at the middle management level. Project&#13;
Preparation and Implementation Support (engineering services) amounts to US$2.0&#13;
million (all ST TA), and Policy Support ST TA amounts to US$2.5 million. ST TA for&#13;
Institutional Development amounts to about US$4.0 million, including training courses.&#13;
A capacity building program with long-term objectives, focusing on human resources&#13;
management, and designing and implementing management systems required for capacity&#13;
development, will be supported under the project (para. 2.33). ST TA will be reviewed&#13;
on an annual basis.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
3.14    All IDA-financed civil works contracts will be carried out by contractors.&#13;
Procurement for all civil works contracts (total contract values of US$19.3 million) with&#13;
an estimated value of above US$0.5 million would be carried out under ICB procedures&#13;
(aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$15.3 million). As no contract is estimated to&#13;
cost over US$10.0 million equivalent, no prequalification is expected to be required. For&#13;
civil works of up to US$0.5 million (total contract values of US$13.6 million, and&#13;
aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$9.1 million), NCB procedures would be&#13;
employed, and bidding would be open to all appropriately registered and interested local&#13;
firms and foreign firms. The extension works at the Teyateyaneng center will be bid&#13;
under NCB procedures. Local procurement rules applicable to NCB were reviewed, and&#13;
found acceptable and consistent with IDA guidelines so that no waiver will be required.&#13;
Selected small contracts may be directly contracted for periodic maintenance on LCU and&#13;
CWS gravel roads (total contract values of US$2.3 million, and IDA aggregate&#13;
contribution of up to US$1 million), and rehabilitation works on LCU roads (total&#13;
contract values of US$ 1.1 million, and IDA aggregate contribution of up to US$0.5&#13;
million), which are to be carried out by local labor-based contractors trained under the&#13;
IEP or under this project, provided that: (i) IDA's prior no objection has been obtained;&#13;
(ii) prices are established by an independent consultant or through negotiations; and (iii)&#13;
within the limit of up to a maximum of US$ 100,000 per contract -equivalent to the&#13;
average cost of such contracts- corresponding to an aggregate IDA contribution of up to&#13;
US$1.5 million. Small local contractors will be eligible for only one direct contract upon&#13;
graduation from training, provided that they have not been previously awarded an ICB or&#13;
NCB contract. The standard timing of the procurement process and the various packages&#13;
are included in the Implementation Manual. A summarized packaging plan is included in&#13;
Annex J.&#13;
3.15  Consultants for technical and management services and studies would be&#13;
appointed in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Design for most rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading components of the program will be prepared by consultants (design for&#13;
rehabilitation of RB unpaved roads and upgrading of CWS roads by LCU will be carried&#13;
out in-house), and reviewed by IDA. It is expected that consultancies for engineering&#13;
surveys and design could be extended on a sole source basis for the supervision of the&#13;
works to be subsequently carried out, provided that performance was satisfactory and&#13;
clearance obtained from the IDA Regional Procurement Office. This provision, as well&#13;
as the agreement that Lesotho taxation laws will apply to all consultants employed in the&#13;
Project, will be included in all Letters of Invitation (LOI). Annex K summarizes the&#13;
various consultants packages and selection method.&#13;
3.16 Contracts for goods with an estimated value above US$100,000 and all laboratory&#13;
equipment (control and field surveys equipment) will be procured using ICB procedures&#13;
(total contract values of US$0.5 million and aggregate IDA contribution of up to US$0.5&#13;
million). Contracts will be grouped as far as possible to match these thresholds.&#13;
However, International shopping, or alternatively, IAPSO procedures, could be used for&#13;
vehicles and office equipment up to a maximum of US$50,000 equivalent per contract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
(total contract values of US$0.4 million, and aggregate IDA contribution of US$0.3&#13;
million). Local shopping could be used for furniture and materials required to refurbish&#13;
the Teyateyaneng training center up to US$30,000 equivalent per contract (total contract&#13;
values of US$0.2 million corresponding to an aggregate IDA contribution of US$0.1&#13;
million equivalent).&#13;
3.17 All contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 and individuals above US$&#13;
50,000, and goods packages above US$100,000 equivalent, and all upgrading and&#13;
rehabilitation civil works packages above US$500,000, will be subject to prior review by&#13;
IDA. Neither LCU and CWS periodic maintenance contracts, nor RB and LCU gravel&#13;
roads rehabilitation contracts under US$100,000 equivalent, nor individual consultants'&#13;
contracts below US$50,000, will undergo prior review but will be subjected to random&#13;
post review (one in eight). Contracts to be reviewed represent about 90 % of IDA&#13;
financing. All first contracts of each category will be reviewed by IDA. The first&#13;
contracts are scheduled to be tendered in July 1996, and supervision consultants will be&#13;
appointed when negotiating the contracts with lowest bidders. Packages financed by&#13;
parallel co-financiers will be prepared according to the practices or guidelines of the&#13;
respective donors.&#13;
3.18  The 1995-revised Bank documents will be used as standard bidding and contract&#13;
documents for all ICB civil works and goods contracts, and consulting services. The RB&#13;
presently uses the standard FIDIC contract documents for their major construction,&#13;
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance contracts. However, the FIDIC conditions of&#13;
contract are far too tough and restrictive for use by the new small-scale contractors, with&#13;
respect to the requirements for bank guarantees, performance bonds, liability insurance,&#13;
etc. The LCU has prepared simpler contract conditions for labor-based local contractors,&#13;
which have been reviewed and revised for use as standard documents for small-scale&#13;
contractors under the project, and included in the Implementation Manual. Standard&#13;
bidding and contract documents for the project have been agreed at negotiations. Short-&#13;
term technical assistance is included in the project to further develop as needed, on the&#13;
basis of the standard documents for local contractors currently used by LCU, a simpler&#13;
set of contract documents and conditions to be used under NCB and direct contracting&#13;
procedures by both the RB and the LCU (paras. 2.25 and 2.26).&#13;
3.19  A standard LOI format for consultancies will be agreed prior to effectiveness,&#13;
stipulating the bid conditions for consultants with regard to reimbursable and allowances&#13;
(office, office furniture, and operating costs will be financed by GOL). Improved&#13;
standard specifications and design and environmental standards will be developed under&#13;
the project (para. 2.28). Updates to existing feasibility studies will be commissioned for&#13;
the upgrading of road sections included in the outer years of the program.&#13;
3.20  Procurement matters and consultant related activities will be the responsibility of&#13;
RB and LCU. The review of procurement management procedures shows that there is a&#13;
need to strengthen capacity and organization to efficiently manage the procurement&#13;
process of the project. A procurement and contract management system, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
checklists for bidding documents' preparation and standard evaluation report formats,&#13;
will be developed and gradually instituted in MOW by the Contract Manager in the&#13;
FCMU. Furthermore 5 local contract managers will be appointed in the regional offices&#13;
of RB and LCU to handle procurement matters and contract monitoring. The training&#13;
program will include sessions for RB and LCU staff responsible for procurement and&#13;
engineering, and the restructuring of MOW agencies will be conducted with a view to&#13;
ensuring that enough manpower is devoted to procurement.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;

3.22 All applications to withdraw proceeds from the credit will be fully documented,&#13;
except for (i) expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of US$ 100,000 or less&#13;
for civil works; (ii) US$100,000 or less for goods, consulting firms, and training; and (iii)&#13;
US$50,000 for individual consultants which reimbursement may be made against&#13;
certified statements of expenditures (SOE). Documentation supporting expenditures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
claimed against SOEs, would be retained by FCMU, and would be made available for&#13;
review by IDA supervision missions and annual audits as necessary.&#13;
3.23  To facilitate disbursements, the Government would open a Special Account (SA)&#13;
in a Banking Institution located in Maseru, acceptable to IDA, for IDA's share of eligible&#13;
expenditures. The SA would be managed by the FCMU. IDA would provide an initial&#13;
deposit of US$2 million to IDA's account to cover four months of expenditures. Upon&#13;
effectiveness, an amount of US$1 million will be deposited to the Special Account. The&#13;
remaining balance will be made available when the aggregate amount withdrawn form&#13;
the credit account amounts to US$4 million. The FCMU would be responsible for&#13;
submitting regular replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documents for&#13;
expenditures. Such applications must be submitted monthly but no later than every three&#13;
months. A local bank account may be opened for payments in local currency, using&#13;
funds withdrawn from the Special Account, provided that the funds transferred are&#13;
utilized within 30 days.&#13;
3.24 IDA will co-finance periodic maintenance on LCU and CWS roads, but will only&#13;
finance selected contracts, with GOL fully financing the remainder, such that GOL&#13;
finances respectively 50% and 80% of the periodic maintenance expenditures in years&#13;
1996/1997 and 1998/1999 (paras 2.46 and 2.48). Disbursement of IDA funds for paving&#13;
main gravel roads and upgrading selected rural roads (for respective amounts of US$4.5&#13;
and 2.3 million) will take place after March 1998.&#13;
E. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING&#13;
3.25 The FCMU will be responsible for coordinating project accounting, maintaining&#13;
overall records, producing an aggregated and consolidated project account for the project,&#13;
managing disbursements, and ensuring timely audit of accounts (para. 2.34). Annual&#13;
audits of the IEP project accounts, including the SA and SOEs, are satisfactorily carried&#13;
out by the Auditor General's Office, and it is proposed to keep this arrangement. In&#13;
addition to the audit report, a management letter (including recommendations regarding&#13;
possible improvements in financial management practices and controls) will be submitted&#13;
to IDA, within six months of the end of the Lesotho fiscal year (March 30). GOL has&#13;
provided assurances at negotiations that Project accounting will be made in accordance&#13;
with sound accounting standards, and that timely preparation and submission of annual&#13;
financial reports will be ensured (para. 5.6).&#13;
F. MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
3.26 The MOW Project Coordinator, on the basis of reports from RB, LCU and CWS,&#13;
will prepare monthly reports, graphically displaying physical and financial progress&#13;
against agreed targets, summarizing procurement status, and highlighting problems, with&#13;
recommendations for solving them. These reports will be distributed at the end of each&#13;
month and will be the subject of Project Coordinating Committee meetings to be held&#13;
monthly. Minutes of these meetings will be attached to the following monthly report,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
with comments indicating actions taken since the last meeting. Quarterly reports will&#13;
summarize the status of each component and the degree of compliance with covenants&#13;
and agreements. Within six months of the closing of the credit, MOW will prepare a&#13;
report on the implementation of the project. GOL has provided assurances at negotiations&#13;
that it will adopt Project reporting and monitoring procedures acceptable to IDA (para.&#13;
5.6).&#13;
G. SUPERVISION&#13;
3.27 Overall, supervision will amount to a total of 15 weeks of field supervision per&#13;
annum, requiring an annual travel/subsistence budget of about US$30,000. In addition,&#13;
review of documents, reports, etc., in Washington will take an additional 15 weeks per&#13;
annum. A plan for the supervision of this project, including a summary of IDA&#13;
requirements, is included in Annex M.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   Substantial quantifiable and non-quantifiable economic benefits are expected from&#13;
the project, and in particular: (i) alleviation of poverty; (ii) lower transport and vehicle&#13;
operating costs; and (iii) reduction in road works costs from the increased competition&#13;
associated with the development of a LRCI. The project is expected to impact positively&#13;
a significantly large proportion of poor people, through the large amount of jobs created&#13;
from labor-based works and increased access to basic services from upgrading and&#13;
rehabilitating rural roads in isolated mountainous areas to all weather standards (para.&#13;
4.12). Increased freight and exchange of goods, in particular cattle raised in mountainous&#13;
areas, could also result from improved access to district towns due to the upgrading and&#13;
rehabilitation of key priority roads. Transport in general will benefit from the lower&#13;
vehicle operating costs which will result from improved road conditions. In addition,&#13;
much of the rehabilitation works of roads on the brink of severe deterioration will serve&#13;
to preserve past investments from accelerated road deterioration, and substantial savings&#13;
in future investment and vehicle operating costs are expected from the strengthening of&#13;
road maintenance. The development of local contractors, besides its poverty reduction&#13;
focus through the support to employment-generating labor-based contractors, aims at&#13;
reducing costs with the increase in competition amongst contractors, and at enhancing&#13;
efficiency of maintenance operations. The project will also strengthen the&#13;
implementation capacity in the road sector through capacity building focusing on&#13;
streamlining management and planning procedures. Systematic beneficiary assessments&#13;
with road users and local officials, and local involvement in setting priority road upgrading&#13;
works, will be used to maximize benefits.&#13;
4.2   The economic analysis for civil works on main roads is based upon the IEP-&#13;
developed PMMS data base, after updating traffic estimates and unit costs, reducing the&#13;
average traffic growth figure from the NTS projections of 6 to 7% for the next five years&#13;
to a more realistic 4%, and entering road condition estimates for the LCU network.&#13;
Revised road condition estimates for the gravel and earth roads network were also used.&#13;
It assessed economic and financial costs, taxes and duties, and foreign and local&#13;
percentages, and results are based on HDM (Highway Development Model) runs, which&#13;
generally produced consistent results with the PMMS. The analysis has focused on&#13;
ensuring that investments made are high priority, and rehabilitation and upgrading of&#13;
major roads are all economically viable. No road reconstruction was found to have an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
internal economic rate of return (IRR) higher than 12%. The PMMS and HDM analysis&#13;
also determined appropriate maintenance options for the RB roads.&#13;
4.3   Concerning the upgrading of rural roads to all-weather standards by LCU, it was&#13;
agreed with GOL that the analysis of LCU and CWS roads would not be based solely on&#13;
a ranking of estimated ERRs to select the highest priority roads. This would not meet the&#13;
key GOL objectives of poverty alleviation and opening access to mountainous areas.&#13;
Instead, roads have been selected on the basis of both economic analysis (first year ERR&#13;
and NPV/C values) weighted with prioritization criteria (population served, District&#13;
Council priority ranking, and traffic thresholds). Those criteria have been agreed at&#13;
negotiations (paras 3.5). Rehabilitation and maintenance of village roads will be selected&#13;
on the basis of communities involvement and choice. IDA's role will be to ensure that&#13;
criteria used are consistent, and that a network rationale is carried out in selecting roads.&#13;
4.4   Details of the economic analysis are included in the Implementation Manual, and&#13;
are summarized in Annex N. The analysis will be updated annually as the program&#13;
develops, in particular for the upgrading part of the program, and vehicle operating costs&#13;
will be monitored during the project by establishing baseline data at the beginning of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.5   Upgrading Works (about 28 % of civil works base costs): the average IRR is&#13;
about 121% for RB sections to be upgraded from gravel to paved standards, and the&#13;
NPV/Coat ratio for upgrading LCU roads to engineered gravel standards is 0.7 overall.&#13;
Guidelines will be agreed to ensure that comparisons between feasibility studies are&#13;
possible. About 250 km out of a total of 416 km of CWS rural roads to be upgraded to&#13;
engineered gravel standards currently have positive NPV/C values.&#13;
4.6   Rehabilitation Works (about 12 % of civil works base costs): the average IRR is&#13;
about 49% for RB paved roads, confirming that rehabilitation is economically viable.&#13;
Rehabilitation of RB gravel roads in poor condition shows an average IRR of 65%.&#13;
Concerning LCU roads, Unit NPV ratios (NPV/km) average 0.025.&#13;
4.7   Periodic Maintenance Works (about 22 % of civil works base costs): IRRs&#13;
average about 35 % for paved roads (ranging from 12 to 55 %), and 80% for gravel roads&#13;
(ranging from 61 to 114%).&#13;
4.8   The sensitivity analysis, which was conducted with regard to traffic and discount&#13;
rates, shows that roads included in the program qualify with a traffic growth rate as low&#13;
as 2% and with a discount rate as high as 20%, with the exception of a few links.&#13;
B. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
4.9   Key indicators of successful project implementation include inter alia: (i) jobs&#13;
created; (ii) lower road transport unit costs and vehicle operating costs attributable to road&#13;
condition improvements; (iii) timely and satisfactory completion of various categories of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
road works financed under the project, as well as programmed rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of roads; (iv) increasing the percentage of classified roads in good or fair&#13;
condition over the five years period; (v) increased entrance of private local contractors&#13;
into the industry; (vi) funding levels; and (vii) certified completed training of road&#13;
engineers and technicians and employment of road engineers and technicians. Progress at&#13;
the institutional level will be monitored through completed studies, assessment of&#13;
achievements under the various Institutional Reform action plans, elaboration of a&#13;
manpower development plan, and regular progress reports. Monitoring of success will&#13;
also be carried out through the early elaboration of baseline data in selected areas (para.&#13;
3.4), subsequent surveys with communities and District Authorities (para. 3.7), and&#13;
consultations with the Advisory Road Board (para. 3.8) during the project execution&#13;
period.&#13;
4.10  A list of detailed time-bound and monitorable, quantitative and qualitative, project&#13;
and sector, project performance indicators to measure implementation success is included&#13;
in Annex 0, and has been agreed with GOL at negotiations. Specific measures and&#13;
yearly targets for each of these items have been defined, in particular those concerning&#13;
contracting out (in line with development of local contractors and restructuring of&#13;
selected Force Account units), length of routine and periodic maintenance for both the&#13;
paved and gravel networks, and corresponding funding figures and users charges.&#13;
C. POVERTY REDUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION&#13;
4.11  The project supports upgrading, rehabilitating and maintaining roads in the&#13;
Highlands, which were identified in the Poverty Assessment Study as more poverty prone&#13;
than other parts of the country. About 37% of the upgrading road program concerns&#13;
CWS roads, mostly located in poorly served mountainous areas, which will result in&#13;
motor access where it previously did not exist, or only in the dry season. The upgrading&#13;
of RB and LCU roads concerns links between District towns in the same disadvantaged&#13;
areas. Those works are also expected to reduce transportation costs, which will benefit&#13;
the poor who could more easily become road transport users. Moreover, the FWP earth&#13;
tracks program and LHWP Development Fund program aim principally at these same&#13;
areas.&#13;
4.12 The poor will benefit from the safety net provided through productive&#13;
employment-generating labor-based works and local contractors-developed jobs. It is&#13;
estimated that the upgrading and rehabilitation of major roads and periodic maintenance&#13;
of paved roads will provide about 1,500 jobs over the 5-year period (90% of this labor is&#13;
likely to be Basotho, including 15% skilled, 25% semi-skilled and 60% unskilled).&#13;
Upgrading and rehabilitation works on rural roads, using labor-based techniques, will&#13;
create about 400,000 person days per year or about 1,200 permanent jobs-equivalent.&#13;
Moreover, all maintenance activities on LCU gravel roads (a third of the classified&#13;
network) will be carried out through labor-based methods by local contractors, all earth&#13;
roads be upgraded and maintained by communities' crews under the FWP program, and&#13;
labor-based routine maintenance will gradually be implemented on the classified RB&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
paved roads network, through labor-based methods by local contractors. The extension of&#13;
the maintenance system will create supplementary employment to farmers and village&#13;
people the country over for an estimated total equivalent to 1,500 permanent jobs&#13;
(comparatively more in the poorest areas), and numerous temporary jobs (1,500 jobs&#13;
equivalent) in maintenance which will be created at the grassroots level. In addition, the&#13;
CWS program will create about 4.8 million days of works through the road works&#13;
(including 1.8 million for upgrading works and 1 million for construction works), and&#13;
about 630,000 days of work through the construction of culverts and footbridges, which&#13;
is the equivalent of about 3,000 permanent jobs. The LHWP Development Fund program&#13;
is also expected to create a large number ofjobs with its currently estimated 550 km of&#13;
village roads construction and upgrading. The total permanent job-equivalent figure for&#13;
the whole of the road programs under the project amounts to about 6,000 permanent jobs&#13;
equivalent, or 2 million person days.&#13;
4.13  IDA-funding of the labor-based works concerns: (i) most contracts for the&#13;
rehabilitation of LCU gravel roads; (ii) a share of periodic maintenance of gravel roads;&#13;
and (iii) about 50% of the upgrading program from earth to gravel roads. Total IDA-&#13;
financing for labor-based civil works amounts to about US$10 million, i.e. about 40% of&#13;
its funding of road works.&#13;
D. DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CONTRACTORS&#13;
4.14  The local contractors capacity to take over maintenance/rehabilitation works has&#13;
been assessed and is reflected in the implementation and financing plan. The local road&#13;
construction industry development strategy, which is based on the extension of the IEP-&#13;
implemented LCU pilot program, aims, besides its poverty reduction focus through the&#13;
further development of local contractors using labor-based techniques, at reducing unit&#13;
costs of road works associated with the expected increase in competition. Using private&#13;
contractors will enhance efficiency of maintenance operations, with the public sector role&#13;
being restricted to its natural design standards-setting, investment-programming,&#13;
technical supervision and quality control, and contract monitoring functions. An Action&#13;
plan will be included in the Implementation Manual after being reviewed prior to&#13;
effectiveness (para. 5.7). It will in particular focus on training in business management,&#13;
book keeping, site and plant management, and tendering (contract appreciation,&#13;
guarantees,...) based on series of in-house seminars and workshops (aimed at improving&#13;
the skills of both MOW personnel and local contractors), and hands-on training whereby&#13;
contractors are given stretches of road to either rehabilitate or maintain.&#13;
4.15  However, for technical and financial capacity reasons, periodic maintenance on&#13;
paved roads will be performed for the most part by more sophisticated regional&#13;
contractors proficient in the use of the required equipment-intensive techniques. RIU&#13;
would carry out minor resealing works on small sections during the initial period of the&#13;
road program, before being restructured/privatized. Moreover, the limited amount of&#13;
works in that category each year limits the possibility for contractors to invest upfront in&#13;
the necessary equipment. The creation of a sustainable local industry, through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
strategy to contract out to local contractors, cannot be applied initially to paved roads&#13;
(except routine maintenance), and to all categories of works on gravel roads. Concerning&#13;
paved roads, regional or overseas firms will carry out rehabilitation and upgrading from&#13;
gravel to paved standards, in addition to periodic maintenance. Upgrading of RB and&#13;
LCU unpaved roads will be initially carried out by regional contractors and force account&#13;
until domestic contractors have developed the capacity to take over. Careful packaging&#13;
and the use of alternative forms of contracting has been used to develop the local&#13;
contracting industry (paras 2.25 and 3.14), and standard bidding and contract documents&#13;
have been prepared for use under the project (para. 3.18).&#13;
E. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
4.16  The project comprises rehabilitation and upgrading of existing roads, not&#13;
construction of new roads, and direct environmental impacts should be minimal. The&#13;
bulk of the upgrading works concerns rural roads, which will undergo works to be mostly&#13;
carried out with labor intensive methods by small local contractors. Technical&#13;
specifications have been reviewed and found acceptable. Indirect impacts, that would&#13;
result if improving transport efficiency were to promote non-sustainable exploitation of&#13;
valuable or fragile resources, and lead to resources depletion and degradation of&#13;
important ecosystems, are expected to be negligible at the proposed levels of&#13;
rehabilitation and/or improvement. Improved maintenance under the project will have a&#13;
positive environmental impact. As no road realignment is envisaged, no resettlement is&#13;
expected to take place. Hence from an environmental standpoint, the project has been&#13;
classified in category "B". An Environment Analysis and Mitigation Plan has been&#13;
prepared and is included in Annex P.&#13;
4.17 Although the Ministry does not have sufficient environmental assessment or&#13;
management capacity at the present time, environmental concerns are handled by&#13;
consulting engineers. Environmental impact studies will be conducted, as part of the&#13;
design studies for the upgrading of existing roads, to assess the direct negative impacts&#13;
resulting from civil works and related activities such as excavation and borrow operations.&#13;
Moreover, careful monitoring of resettlement issues will be carried out as part of the&#13;
design studies for the upgrading of existing roads, which could result in minor&#13;
realignments due to earthworks and widening. Final engineering design would include the&#13;
necessary provisions to counteract both direct and indirect environmental and resettlement&#13;
impacts, and also ensure that contract documents contain apprpriate measures to mitigate&#13;
such adverse effects. Standard Terms of Reference, including specific environmental&#13;
clauses, have been prepared for surveys, feasibility and design studies, and supervision.&#13;
Standard bidding and contract documents to be used for all works will incorporate the&#13;
recommendations of the study on the socio-environmental aspects of LCU road works,&#13;
and include the necessary provisions to counteract both direct and indirect environmental&#13;
impacts. Standard bidding and contract documents have been agreed at negotiations.&#13;
4.18 The project will support strengthening GOL environmental analysis and&#13;
monitoring capacity in the roads sector. The Institutional Reform sub-component of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
project includes technical assistance to define environmental standards, quality control&#13;
procedures, and adapted design standards for road works (para. 2.28). This will support&#13;
the current effort of the Ministry of Works to work with the National Environmental&#13;
Secretariat to develop guidelines. Training will also be provided under the project to&#13;
design and supervision staff in environmental evaluation and monitoring of project&#13;
impacts (para. 2.40). A study on the socio-environmental aspects of LCU road work in&#13;
Lesotho has also been carried out, and its relevant findings will be included into the next&#13;
phases of the training program.&#13;
4.19  GOL has provided assurances at negotiations that they will: (a) prepare detailed&#13;
environmental guidelines, acceptable to IDA, before the mid-term review; and (b)&#13;
undertake road upgrading or construction investments, after an environmental assessment&#13;
has been carried out in accordance with environmental guidelines satisfactory to IDA, and&#13;
design standards and construction methods aimed at minimizing possible adverse&#13;
environmental impacts have been adopted (para. 5.6).&#13;
4.20 Implementation arrangements provide for annual reviews to be conducted each&#13;
year in order to determine which roads will undergo works in the next year. Pending&#13;
positive review, including inter alia the satisfactory completion of environmental&#13;
assessments, the detailed road programs for each year will be agreed.&#13;
F. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.21  The sustainability of the project will depend on (i) the ability of the Road Fund to&#13;
provide for adequate and timely maintenance financing; (ii) the capacity of MOW to&#13;
restructure and manage more efficiently its operations, better plan interventions on the&#13;
road network, and retain qualified staff; (iii) the proper restructuring of the institutional&#13;
environment of MOW, and the creation of a more client-oriented approach; and (iv) the&#13;
development of local contractors. It is expected that improved cost recovery mechanisms&#13;
to fund maintenance, careful monitoring of the rehabilitation and maintenance program,&#13;
strengthened road management procedures, implementation of reorganized maintenance&#13;
systems, should ensure the implementation of a sustainable road management system.&#13;
This will be facilitated by IDA financing rehabilitation and a share of periodic&#13;
maintenance of rural roads during the early years of the project, and the strengthening of&#13;
the Road Fund under the project. Donor funding of upgrading works will be tied to GOL&#13;
meeting domestic funding, and satisfactory progress with institutional reform and&#13;
capacity building (paras 3.5 and 3.6).&#13;
4.22  Sustainability would stem in the short to medium term from continued&#13;
improvement in the implementation capacity in MOW, and close monitoring of the&#13;
transfer of technology from technical assistance (guidelines and objective indicators of&#13;
accomplishment will be agreed at negotiations). Sustainability of the program is being&#13;
supported by a carefully designed capacity building sub-component, including a&#13;
comprehensive training program focusing on both MOW staff and local contractors&#13;
(pw  2.25 and 2.40), the implementation of revised operational procedures (para. 2.36),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
the elaboration of a manpower development plan (para. 2.39), and by addressing the long&#13;
standing issue of staff retention through short-term measures and logistical support (para.&#13;
2.36).&#13;
4.23  Emphasizing sectoral reform from the outset of the project, and proper phasing of&#13;
policy reforms vis a vis the relatively low absorptive capacity in Government (regrouping&#13;
road agencies, restructuring PVPS and the largest force account units, setting guidelines and&#13;
standards, and strengthening MOW's planning, financial and managerial capacity in the&#13;
early phase of the project, and subsequently creating an autonomous Road Authority and&#13;
strengthening the management and recovery procedures of the Road Fund) are key to the&#13;
sustainability of the road management institutional arrangements to be established under&#13;
the project. The project success will be enhanced by the creation of a group of&#13;
stakeholders interested in supporting and monitoring the program, and depends on its&#13;
ability to accurately sound users needs, and account for choices of representatives of&#13;
District Councils of isolated areas.&#13;
4.24  Creating an environment for sustainable road management requires the timely&#13;
development of an efficient local construction industry, which the project will specifically&#13;
support (paras 2.25 and 4.14) to avoid the risks of local contractors not developing fast&#13;
enough to meet the works increasing requirements.&#13;
G. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
4.25 A key risk is whether GOL will be able to finance the associated maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation costs, and be able to manage the contracting out process associated with the&#13;
increase in maintenance activities. This would require sustained commitment to policy&#13;
reforms, and changes in financing procedures (recovery from road users via the Road&#13;
Fund). This risk is more generally linked to the uncertainty of the economic and political&#13;
environment in Lesotho, road works costs remaining high, or generated road traffic lower&#13;
than expected (and hence lower revenues). GOL would commit to at least raise the full&#13;
maintenance requirements from user charges (para. 2.50), which would require an&#13;
increase in the user charges without raising the cost of fuel to the consumer above the&#13;
corresponding cost in South Africa by more than 5%.&#13;
4.26  Achievement of project objectives and preventing delays in implementation rest&#13;
in part on the timing and extent of policy and institutional reforms, and the pace of&#13;
development of institutional and operational capacity in MOW, which currently remains&#13;
limited, in particular in contract management and works supervision. While the project&#13;
would include measures to continue local capacity building and MOW restructuring,&#13;
bringing about change is a medium to long-term effort. A strategy of utilizing short-term&#13;
technical assistance to compensate for the diminishing number of long-term expatriates,&#13;
combined with short-term training aimed at middle management, has been developed to&#13;
mitigate capacity constraints in the near-term (para. 3.12), while a longer-term capacity&#13;
development program focusing on human resources management is underway (para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
2.39). Up-front policy reforms have been included to manage the risks (para. 4.23), but&#13;
will not eliminate them.&#13;
4.27 Flexible overall project design and phased investment plans, combined with&#13;
annual formal project reviews have been used to mitigate the possibility of delays in&#13;
implementation and some of these uncertainty risks. If institutional development and&#13;
capacity building were slow, re-allocation of resources to the critical areas, and&#13;
modification of terms of reference will be introduced at annual reviews. Were the&#13;
implementation capacity to prove weaker than anticipated, funding not increased to a level&#13;
consistent with maintenance requirements, and institutional reforms delayed, the civil&#13;
works program will be implemented over a longer period or the outer years of the project&#13;
will be trimmed back accordingly after the mid-term review. Another risk is related to the&#13;
development of local contractors, especially with regard to the drain that the LHWP&#13;
Development Fund program could create on a still low number of contractors and already&#13;
limited works supervision capacity in MOW.&#13;
4.28 Institutional risks and mitigation actions are summarized in the table below:&#13;

LETTER OF ROADS SECTOR POLICY&#13;
GOVERNMENT OF LESOTHO&#13;
Preamble&#13;
The kcy. problorno-faatd by thc roads sector lar the current injAequate overal levwel Qf&#13;
recurrent and investment budgets, the geographical and topographical formation of the&#13;
country which influences the allocation of expenditures to mainly benefit the major roads&#13;
in the lowlad, t*o undclpd cA             utu- resultiag in the laak of&#13;
inplamentation capacity, and the fragmented organizational structure resulting in an&#13;
uncoordinated management and planning of the road network. Government of Lesotho's&#13;
National Policy for Roads sets the pace for implementing the needed reforns to strsniline&#13;
the road sector organization and road maintenanr. and rehabilitation finding mechanism.&#13;
It is against this background that the Lesotho Government Road Sector, therefor, has the&#13;
foiowing objectives:&#13;
1.    Objectives for the Roads Sector&#13;
The overall objective Is tw have network capahbtw of buppuaLgiu Tiactond -cu,tusn"&#13;
activities, providing accessibility to communities, in particular those living in&#13;
isolated rural districts, and linking district towns. This implies the restoration of&#13;
the network to passable conditions everywhere.&#13;
Specific objectives of the Roads Sector are to:&#13;
(a)   faciitate and optmize traffic circulation, decrease vehicle opratng costs,&#13;
and reduce the probability of vehicle accidents, to the greatest exten&#13;
possible;&#13;
(b) enable vehiwcular access to all areas of the country particularly isolated&#13;
centrs of population;&#13;
(c)   create employnment through the utilization, wherever possible, of labor-&#13;
based methods of road construction and maintenance; and&#13;
(d)   enable the establishment in rural aeas of social infrastructures such as&#13;
whois, clici., an watArMuir  wppy )hm&#13;
The roads strategy, therefore focuses on strengthening the institutional capacity of&#13;
the Ministry of Works (MOW), reforrning the institutional environment, and&#13;
esablishing new financing mechanisms to ensure that roads agencies will have the&#13;
eapalty to manage and filly maintain the national road network by the end of the&#13;
decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
2.    Prcaea*4astitutional lcipons.ibilitiea&#13;
The national roads sector comprises the following Govemrnment agenciies:&#13;
(a)   Roads Branch;&#13;
(b)   Labor Construction Unit-&#13;
(c)   Civil Works Section;&#13;
(d)   Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, and&#13;
(e)   Municipal Authorities.&#13;
Prior tn 1968. the Rnoa  BrAinch (RR) w*t the qnAi (nvf:mimmant RagfflE cSayrng&#13;
out road works on a national level. Since that time, the Civil Works Section in&#13;
1968 and the Labor Construction Unit in 1977 have joined the Road Branch as&#13;
naional roads agencies, albeit at different levels of operation. The Roads Branch&#13;
is a department within the Ministry of Works and is currently responsible for the&#13;
ad-inistration of about 2,300 kIn of paved and gravelled gazetted roads.&#13;
The Labor Construction UTiit (LCU) is a depanment within the Ministry of Works&#13;
It differs from the finction of the Roads Branch in that it consucts and maintain&#13;
its road network using labourAased-methods (i.e. a combinaton of labor-intensive&#13;
and plant-based methods) and its consruction operations are carried out totaly in-&#13;
house. The LCU construct roads to an all-weather gravel standard and is&#13;
resonsib for the upgrading and maintenance of a road network, currently&#13;
estimated to cover about 850 km of gravel roads, and expected to evenataily cover&#13;
2,300 km.&#13;
The Civil Works Section (CWS) was established in 1968 for the purpose of&#13;
providing drought relief on a food for work basis. It fails under tho  instry of&#13;
Local Government and is responsible for the. construction and maintence of&#13;
some 1,570 km of eath roads and sections of gravel roads. In addition, the CWS&#13;
is also responsible for the construction of rural clinics and footbridge in isolated&#13;
The Lotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) falls within the Ministry&#13;
ofNatural Resoures, Its primary purpose is to administer the Lesotho fighlands&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Water Project. As part of these construction works, it has been necessry for the&#13;
LHDA to construct suitable access to their sites. In some cases this has meant&#13;
upgrading existing roads, and in other cases it has meant constructing totally now&#13;
roads. It is not a statutory roads authority, but it is nonetheless vested with the&#13;
responsibility of maintaining the roads it has construction up to the completion of&#13;
the appropriate phase of the project.&#13;
In accordance with the TowrnArul Country Phnmung A%.k uf1940, and the Urban&#13;
Goverunent Act of 1983, Municipal Councils are responsible for the planning and&#13;
control of urban roads. However. Maseru City Council is the only Municipal City&#13;
Council existing at the moment. At district level. the office the District so;rezy...&#13;
perfonrms the functiona of the  2uripit Council with regard to rouds, and the&#13;
works are carried on a sub-warrant basis by the Ministry of Works.&#13;
3.    Proposed Institutional and Capacity Building Arrangements&#13;
In the Ught of the foregoing, the Government strategy will in the short-term focus&#13;
on improving the performance of administrative bodies and in particular,&#13;
strengthening the institutional capacity of MOW by regrouping all road agencies&#13;
under its authority.&#13;
In the bsterwst of rationaliWng the current overlapping of agency responsibilities,&#13;
the Government will relocate the road and footbridge units of the Civil Works&#13;
Secdon fmnm the Ministry of Local Government, to the Ministry of Works. Thus,&#13;
wthn the firmework of o0cnm respamibility ftr roa administration curretly&#13;
exerVsd  by the Ministy of Works. two agencies will be established to restect the&#13;
two differen purposes of the road network, one of which will bau-espomuibiity&#13;
for roads witli nauDM fliportance, while the other will have responsibility for&#13;
roads with local importance&#13;
Another sategy is resources management and career development, forming&#13;
operating and planning/programuing procedures, and reallocating expndiu&#13;
toward maintance, in order for MOW agencies to be able to reinst  regular&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance on the entire road network by they.w 2,000.&#13;
This requires increasing financial comniunents to ensure that road are mdatained&#13;
to an adequate standard to preserve past invetments, and that development wthin&#13;
the toads sctor is based on environmentally sound practices.&#13;
Long-term davelopment will require the continued and successlzl implementaion&#13;
of a comprehensive manpower development plan and chnges in GOL's Psonnel&#13;
and Pay policies. While the last point is a general civil service reform issue, GOL&#13;
is committed to developing a strategy to retain qualified staff within the Roads&#13;
Seater, and to imlement an action plan inaluding various measures to improve&#13;
retention atqualfed staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
In addition, Government is keen on facilitating the creation of an environment that&#13;
allows road agencies to operate on a commercial, autonomous and accountable&#13;
basis. The GOL is therefore committed to the established of an autonomous Roads&#13;
Authority in Lesotho, independently financed through user charges.&#13;
Concurrent with thisa ove, the Governmont will cofitinue with the long term&#13;
formation of two closely related lines of development:&#13;
(i)   the training and encouragement of the Local Road Construction&#13;
Industry to a size appropriae for the anount of work available, for&#13;
the purpose of eventually undertaking all routine and peiodic&#13;
maintenance in the country, as well as minor construction work;&#13;
through a gradual increase in contacting out activities, focuing&#13;
primarily on small contractors using labor-buad methods, and&#13;
truining of contractors, and&#13;
(u)   the associated reduction in goverunent activity in road consuction&#13;
and maintenance, which will be bued on a carsfi"ly plamed and&#13;
gradual restructuring of selected force account operation.&#13;
The Government recognizes the need to streamline the operations of the Plant and&#13;
VuiowPuut Sa-vicu (?YPS  antrwUll review the most appropriate form of&#13;
privatizing all or par; of this parastatal Ls part of the recntly enacted Privaization&#13;
DM11 199S. The GOL is committed to: (i) auctioning off PVPS heavy equipment&#13;
wthin a peiod of three years. and selling PVPS light equipment to local&#13;
contractors, in line with the Governmnt streogy to contra out road works,&#13;
before the fint batch of rehabilitation contracts are tendered, (a) asss the&#13;
conditions of decentralizing vehicles maintenance responsibility to each line&#13;
ministry, Ciii) rview the feasibiity of cntcnnS tho maintonce workshop into a&#13;
contract management, and (iv) reorganizing the procurement and managemet of&#13;
the fleet.&#13;
4.    National Roads Progam&#13;
Thd Ministry of Works has developed a National Roads Program whirths thr&#13;
following objectives:&#13;
(a)   to presev the road network fron further deterioration aring ftom lack&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
(b)   Ur,.habjisaz.eroaAL .pcor rondition which have received the loweat lavel&#13;
of maintenance to a minimum level of re-serviceability; and&#13;
(c)   to carry out upgrading work on that pan of a classified road network&#13;
which is not all weather standard. in order to open access to isolated&#13;
priority areas in mountainous districts.&#13;
The programme is to be implemented over a five-year periodt from April 1996 to&#13;
March 2001, with support from the donor-funded Road Rehabilitation and&#13;
Maintenance Project (RJMP). The first two years will focus on rehabilitation and&#13;
reinstating maintenance on the whole classified network. An annual review of the&#13;
program will be held in March each year. This review will consider the&#13;
achievements during the put year and will agree on the work programme for the&#13;
following year. The overall target is to have stopped further deterioration of roads&#13;
currently in good or fhir condition by the year 2000. More specifically, the&#13;
Government is committed to gradually increasing the kilometen of roads under&#13;
routine maintenance from about 2.700 km in 1996/1997 to 3,500 km in&#13;
2000/2001, and reinstating annual periodic maintenance on about 120 km of paved&#13;
and 300 km of unpaved roads over the sane period. This will be achieved through&#13;
allocating suffcient fuanding from internal sources.&#13;
In order to achieve this in the medium ternm it is desirable that an independent&#13;
source of financing will be established for the management and development of the&#13;
roads in Leotho. The Government is, therefore, committed to creating an&#13;
autonomous Road Fund through legislation. It is envisaged that this Road Fund&#13;
will collect and allocate the revenues raised from road user charges (toil gates&#13;
border fees, SACU permits. supplementary heavy vehicle license fee, fizel charges,&#13;
-w.). The Govenment is also conunitted to maintain fll accountability and&#13;
transparency regarding the revenue flow from road users to the Road Fund. An&#13;
Advisory Road Board, which includes stakeholders from the govenment and&#13;
pnvae sector, will be created to assist Govenment in planning and monitoring&#13;
road expenditure. A fIll review of the Road Fund procedures will be undertaken&#13;
in 1997.&#13;
The roads sctor also constitutes an essential aspect of the Government's&#13;
deveopment statgy of poverty alleviation by providing employment through the&#13;
mwdmu use of labor-based methods for carying out the works. Hence. the&#13;
majority of roead works will be performed by local contractors. This is also in&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
The National Transport Study has recently commented tlhat funding should bc&#13;
directed towards rehabilitating and maintaining thc Cxisting network, as new&#13;
construction is difficult to justify in stnctly economic terms.&#13;
In Lesotho, the most impurtant factor underiying the developing of road&#13;
infrastructure is the geographical and topographic formation of the country. This&#13;
LreZf1Us. the Ic"6rrxrTd svdulOITcm,T uC wIunaiun  aci.viyrhFdistribf Ut&#13;
population; and the costs of all types of road construction. The reliance on&#13;
conventional economic evaluation for road development, which has in the past&#13;
been one of the major influences in road development policy, has resulted in the&#13;
development of the present road network, in which the greater part of an improved&#13;
road (paved or a gravel) surface is concentrated in the western lQwlands and&#13;
foothills.&#13;
Government is committed to reverse this past trend of concentrating roads in the&#13;
western lowlands, which would tirther increase their compartive advantage,&#13;
exacerbate the drift of population to the lowland ares with all the attendant&#13;
potential social problems that this movement could bring, and maintain its&#13;
deleterious impact on the whole economy of tho country. To meet its key&#13;
objectives of poverty alleviation and improving access to basic savices in isolated&#13;
mountainous areas of the country, the Government. therefore supports a broader&#13;
based policy for road infastructure development, based on conventional economic&#13;
evaluation for main trunk roads, while adopting specific criteria for areu  with low&#13;
densites of population, low lves of vehicle trOafc and fairly l1aaod ooouomi&#13;
activity.&#13;
Concerning the upgrading of rural roads to all-weather standards by LCXJ the&#13;
highest priorty roads will be selected on the basis of population served, District&#13;
Council priority ranking, and trafic thresholds. In addi&amp;iuni, rhubilitiLtion and&#13;
maintenance of village roads will be selected on the basis of communities'&#13;
participation in the identification, selection and implementation of project&amp;&#13;
The following aspects will be reflected in the priority-setting of roas to be&#13;
upgraded or constructed as part of the CWS-managed Food for Work progran&#13;
and LHWP Development Fund program;&#13;
(i)   vehicle acces to connect population centers to the road network for&#13;
administrative and social purposes,&#13;
(*i)  the effect on the development of economic activity by eabling&#13;
improvements in productive sectors and the provision of acceus to markets;&#13;
(Wii)  the inceased emphasis in the use of labour based methods in conruction,&#13;
maintenance, upgrading and rehabilitation of roads for the cretion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.4nnex B&#13;
emplovment with the closely associated aim of alleviation of pover?y&#13;
(iv)  the need for the provision of permanent river crossings (bridges and other&#13;
appropriate structures) to reduce the isoiation of communities, or to reduce&#13;
travel time between population centers;&#13;
(v)   the completion of the national strategic road network linking all regional&#13;
centers to each other and the national capital, with roads of at least all&#13;
weather capability, and&#13;
(vi)  the increaed emphasis on the need to minimize advers impact on&#13;
environrnent when carrying out all road works; and the increased emphasis&#13;
on fill gournmeni't ronanu wiiatwta pu Lu Lmp;urnnaion oiAS J a.a&#13;
The elaboration of these policies is contained in the national development plana,&#13;
and it is against these that the specific policy objectives for the road sector arm&#13;
established.&#13;
The overall strategy is. therefore, a carefi.d balance between maintaining the&#13;
current road network, and constructing and upgrading roads of appropriate&#13;
srtAndas to serve the needs of both the poorer members of society living in&#13;
inaccessible (often mountainous) areas, and also those of the economy at large.&#13;
63    Proposed Cost Recovery and Financing Arrangements&#13;
The Government's economic development strategy emphasizes the neod to return&#13;
to a syatem of market prices and to aim for full cost recovery for all economic&#13;
servics. In the roads sector. .the.past pattern-has been-to finance maintenance and&#13;
eait itation from general revenues. To meet the high financial requirements of&#13;
the road program Government will adually increase road user ohgcs over the&#13;
project period to cover all routine and periodic maintenance costs, black spot&#13;
improvemem, bridge repairs, and reviewing counterpart fLunding.&#13;
Under the project government will finance, from Road User Charges levied&#13;
through the newly-created Road Fund, 1 00% of routine maintenance on the whole&#13;
classified network. Periodic maintenance (including bridge repaurs) epnditres&#13;
will be nanced through the ame mechanism. However, it was agreed with 1DA&#13;

Annex B&#13;
inancing agencies concerned. To meet the objectives of the maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation program, the Road Fund is expected-to disburse sbout Maloti 36&#13;
million in 1996. The local contribution for the various road upgrading works is&#13;
estimated for 1996 at Maloti 1 million.&#13;
The incremental user charges to be channeled through the Road Fund include: an&#13;
average fuel charge raising total revenues of Maloti 31 nillion, i.e. a fuel charge of&#13;
respectively Lisente 39 per dicsel liter and Lisente 3 1 per petrol liter, the&#13;
breakdoum of Auhich will i o filly ri6tonninod lAre.r&#13;
Fines from enforcing axle-load regulations would be channeled to the Road Fund&#13;
once institutional arrangements for enforcement would have been implemented&#13;
under the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project. The Road Fund will&#13;
mobilize for maintenance, rehabilitation and road safety improvement purposes at&#13;
lost  38 million in FY 1996/97, M40 million in FY 1997198, M44 million in FY&#13;
1999/99, M47 million in FY 1999/2000, MSS million in FY 2000/01, and M60&#13;
million per anum thereafter (in current Maloti figures).&#13;
7.    Enviromental Considerations&#13;
Because of the country's circumstances of a shortage of fertile crop land, heavily&#13;
degrded upland graing pastures, and widespread soil erosion, the Government is&#13;
sensitive to the need to ensure that road works do not have a negative impact on&#13;
the urounding environment. The Government therefore has determined that al&#13;
road works will be conducted to minimize adverse impact on the enAronment.&#13;
3.    Summary of Proposed Policy Actions&#13;
Tho Government's principal objecwve is to clear the larg backlog of madeance&#13;
work on the road network and to put the management and financing of road&#13;
maintenance on a sustainable long-term buis. To that end, it hu committed to;&#13;
(a)   reforming the institutional smtucure of the roads sector, which will require&#13;
to revise the road classification and esablish a gzetting mechanisn to&#13;

LESOTHO&#13;
ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
PROPOSAL TO PUT ROADS ON A FEE-FOR-SERVICE BASIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Allocations for road maintenance currently come from the government's consolidated budget. However,&#13;
given the growing size of the road program and the other urgent demands on the government's budget, it is simply&#13;
not possible to allocate sufficient funds for road maintenance from the consolidated budget. It has therefore been&#13;
agreed to gradually shift the road sector onto a fee-for-service basis under which road users would pay directly for&#13;
road maintenance. The aim is to ensure that: (i) sufficient funds are allocated for maintenance; (ii) maintenance&#13;
allocations cover all roads; (iii) financial discipline is strengthened to ensure that the public gets value-for-money;&#13;
and (iv) the fiscal burden on government is reduced to manageable proportions.&#13;
The fees (or road tariff) will consist of an access fee - road toll-gate fees, border fees/short-term SACU&#13;
permits, license fees on motor vehicles and a supplementary heavy vehicle license fee, and fines on overloaded&#13;
vehicles - and a user fee in the form of road maintenance levy collected on all transport fuels. General budget&#13;
funds would be reserved for upgrading, improvement, and new construction. Since the above charges are not&#13;
regular taxes, but fees-for-service, the proceeds from the road tariff will be deposited into a special fund which has&#13;
been established as the Road Fund by Legal Notice No 179 of 1995 published in the Government Gazette. The&#13;
regulations of the Road Fund have been gazetted in Legal Notice No 16 of 1996. The notice specifies the purpose&#13;
of the special fund, its sources of revenues, and how the fund will be managed. It has been agreed that the Road&#13;
Fund will be pro-actively managed by a representative board of management. The Board has been created within&#13;
the framework of the Legal Notice No 16 of 1996, and is assisted by a full-time independent Secretariat which will&#13;
manage the day-to-day affairs of the Road Fund, and monitor all revenues and expenditures on behalf of the Board.&#13;
The Board reports to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and will generally advise the Minister on all matters&#13;
pertaining to the financing of roads. In the medium term (expected to be two years), based on experience with the&#13;
Board, MOF would seek to bring forward legislation to turn the Board into an autonomous board managing the&#13;
Road Fund in an executive capacity.&#13;
Expenditures to be Financed&#13;
Revenues from the Road Fund will primarily be used to finance routine and periodic maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation of the classified road network, together with maintenance of selected Village Councils roads, and&#13;
selected road safety projects. Village Council roads include those under the jurisdiction of the Civil Works Section&#13;
(CWS) of the Ministry of Local Government as well as roads where the Village Council agrees to make their&#13;
contribution to maintenance through a cost sharing arrangement. Village Councils will be expected to contribute&#13;
50 percent towards the cost of maintaining Village Council roads, and may choose to do so by contributing direct&#13;
labor. District Councils will be expected to contribute 50 percent towards the cost of maintaining urban roads&#13;
using revenues from rates and other local taxes. Road fund revenues may be used to finance rehabilitation, but will&#13;
only be used to finance road upgrading and new works, once all road maintenance requirements have been met.&#13;
Source of Revenues&#13;
Revenues will come from five main sources: (i) road toll-gate fees collected on all vehicles leaving&#13;
Lesotho, including GOL vehicles; (ii) border fees/short-term SACU permits charged on all foreign trucks entering&#13;
Lesotho; (iii) license fees on motor vehicles and a supplementary license fee collected from heavy vehicles to&#13;
ensure they pay in full for the damage they do to the road pavement; (iv) fines on overloaded vehicles; and (v) a&#13;
road maintenance levy added to the price of all transport fuels, including the fuel consumed by government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Lesotho cannot raise its fuel prices above those prevailing in South Africa and it attempts to keep the price of fuel&#13;
at least 5 lisente below the South African level. Since the prices of petrol and diesel in Lesotho are currently 20&#13;
lisente and 12 lisente below those in South Africa, there is scope for adding a road user charge of 15 and 7 lisente&#13;
respectively to the current price of petrol and diesel without reducing the relative margin between Lesotho and&#13;
South Africa to less than 5 lisente. Although the relative prices between Lesotho and South Africa vary, the&#13;
current differentials have been used to estimate the composition of the road maintenance levy.&#13;
The Road Fund Board&#13;
The Board consists of a chairman and eleven members who have been appointed by the Minister of&#13;
Finance. Six members represent concerned government departments and five will represent non-governmental&#13;
organizations. The government members have been nominated by their Principal Secretaries (Ministries of&#13;
Finance, Economic Planning, Works, Transport &amp; Communications, Local Government, and Natural Resources).&#13;
The non-governmental members have been nominated by the organizations they represent (Chamber of Commerce&#13;
and Industry; Bus and Mini-bus Association; Transport Association; Architects, Engineers and Surveyors&#13;
Association; and Law Society). Additional non-voting members may be co-opted to the Board when required.&#13;
Members of the Board are appointed for a period of two years and will be compensated for the time spent attending&#13;
board meetings. Board meetings will be held at least once a month and will have four sub-comnmittees: Road&#13;
Safety, Environment, Engineering, and Road Fees.&#13;
Management of the Road Fund&#13;
In general, funds from the Road Fund will only be disbursed for goods and services forming part of an&#13;
approved maintenance program. Each check withdrawing funds from the road fund will be signed by two people:&#13;
one from the Advisory Board and the other from MOF. Work undertaken by contractors will be certified by a&#13;
registered engineer before payment is made. Road agencies will transmit requests for payment to the road fund&#13;
secretariat (copy to MOF) who will arrange to pay the contractor directly out of the road fund account. Work&#13;
undertaken by force account will be subject to similar financial controls.&#13;
The Board will review the annual expenditure programs put forward by the various road agencies and&#13;
decide, in light of these requests and in consultation with MOF, on the overall size of the road program to be&#13;
financed through the road fund. Based on these revenue requirements, it will then recommend to MOF the&#13;
required levels of the supplementary licenses and road maintenance levy. The Board will also recommend how the&#13;
revenues from the road fund should be sub-divided between the various road agencies entitled to draw from the&#13;
road fund, including those dealing with road safety.&#13;
The Board will negotiate agency agreements with of the Department of Customs and Department of&#13;
Transport and Traffic for collection of road toll-gate fees, border fees/short-term SACU permits, motor vehicle&#13;
license fees and supplementary heavy vehicle license fees. The agreements will provide for fees to be directly&#13;
deposited into a designated account at the Central Bank. The road maintenance levy (added to the price of fuel)&#13;
will be collected by the oil companies in South Africa and paid directly into a designated account at the Central&#13;
Bank.&#13;
The accounts and other financial statements of the road fund will be audited annually by a firm of auditors&#13;
selected by the Auditor General. The audited annual accounts, which will eventually include a Statement of&#13;
Income, a Balance Sheet, and a Statement of Cash Flow, will be published within three months of the end of each&#13;
financial year. The audit will include a full financial audit and a selective technical audit. The Board will also&#13;
publish an annual report within six months of the end of each financial year, dealing generally with the policies&#13;
and activities of the Board during the year, and including a copy of the audited accounts and the auditors report on&#13;
the accounts.&#13;

Annex M&#13;
LESOTHO&#13;
ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
IDA Supervision Input:&#13;
Bank staff or consultant input into the supervision of the project will amount to about 15 staff&#13;
weeks per annum.&#13;
On average two 2-week 1-person missions and one 2-week 3-person mission will be required each&#13;
year throughout the project life. Each mission will include the Project Task Manager, and the 3-person&#13;
mission will include in addition: (i) a Financial Analyst, responsible for monitoring the project financial&#13;
accounts, reviewing progress with the establishment of financial and contract management procedures by&#13;
the FCMU, and monitoring the RF disbursement, management and accounting procedures; and (ii) a Road&#13;
Engineer, responsible for assessing progress with maintenance and rehabilitation works, reviewing the&#13;
programming system and the annual PMMS results, and monitoring the revised road management and&#13;
maintenance procedures established in the road agencies and their regional offices.&#13;
Further expertise -estimated on average at about 5 weeks of additional field supervision per&#13;
annum- will be required in: (i) training and manpower development, (ii) institutional development (Road&#13;
Authority, privatization of MOW units, concession of the PVPS workshop), (iii) definition of&#13;
environmental standards and assessment of environmental analysis conducted for major civil works; and&#13;
(iv) review of surveys and beneficiary assessments.&#13;
In addition to supplement the usual IDA supervision, assistance will be sought from CVP and the&#13;
RMI Unit on institutional issues (in particular the Road Fund and the establishment of a commercially&#13;
oriented Road Authority). A team of Bank staff (Lawyer, Disbursement Officer, Environment Specialist)&#13;
will participate in the mid term review, and advise at annual reviews throughout the project. The lawyer&#13;
will participate in the project launch workshop. The Lesotho Country Team will be requested to advise in&#13;
issues raised during supervision.&#13;
Portfolio Management Operations:&#13;
The review of procurement documents, progress reports, studies reports, and financial statements&#13;
at headquarters, and correspondence and intemal reporting related to such activities, are estimated to&#13;
require about 15 staff weeks per annum.&#13;
Field Supervision:&#13;
It is planned to undertake field supervision missions three times per annum. The plan is shown&#13;
below. The supervision of the project will cover the following broad aspects:&#13;
(i)    Policy Environment: Reviewing the policy and institutional environment, and ensuring that the&#13;
different recommended reforms are satisfactory and consistent with each other will absorb significant&#13;
resources.&#13;
(ii)   Project Implementation: Because of the nature of the project, three supervision missions will be&#13;
required per annum for the entire five-year period.&#13;
(iii)   Donor Co-ordination: Meetings will be organized during each supervision mission with donors to&#13;
ensure that all donors are working harmoniously towards the same common goal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex M&#13;
Other Donors' Supervision Input:&#13;
A mechanism will be developed to allow donors to coordinate their supervision activities. Attempts&#13;
will be made to get donors to fund consultants for the road transport and PVPS restructuring sub-&#13;
components.&#13;
Borrower's Supervision Input:&#13;
MOW will provide IDA with quarterly progress reports in the agreed format. All procurement&#13;
documents will be based on the adopted standard documents. All procurement evaluations submitted to&#13;
IDA for review will be accompanied by a cover note setting out all the information required for review and&#13;
other internal IDA reporting requirements (e.g. Form 384) in the agreed summary form. MOW will provide&#13;
IDA with annual audit reports of the project special accounts, in the format and time schedule specified in&#13;
the credit agreement. Three weeks prior to each mission, IDA will submit to GOL requirements for the&#13;
mission review.&#13;

Annex N&#13;
LESOTHO&#13;
ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF ROAD INVESTMENTS&#13;
Benefits: The direct benefits from upgrading roads to paved or engineered gravel standards are mainly the&#13;
economic benefits accruing to roads having reached a certain traffic threshold (in this case AADTs -annual&#13;
average daily traffic- of respectively 400 and 150). However, cost-benefit analysis for upgrading rural roads does&#13;
not show high economic returns, particularly in the mountainous areas, due to the currently low traffic volumes&#13;
and the relatively higher cost of civil works. Ancillary benefits range from (i) improved transport and mobility to&#13;
and between villages and population centers not currently connected to the overall road network, (ii) use of labor-&#13;
based methods resulting in the creation of employment (iii) year-around access to basic services in areas which are&#13;
now isolated during the rainy season; and (iv) stimulation of agricultural production in areas which had limited&#13;
access prior to upgrading and lack of timely transport services. The direct benefits from rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance will be a reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOCs), which will, in turn, be translated into lower&#13;
transport costs for the movement of people and products. Rehabilitation works tackle: (i) deferred periodic&#13;
maintenance of gravel roads, which mainly affected those roads with AADTs ranging from 100 to 300; and (ii)&#13;
strengthening selected heavy-trafficked paved trunk roads (with AADTs above 5,000) to avoid deterioration caused&#13;
by heavy trucks from the RSA where the legal axle-load limit is 50% higher than in Lesotho. Road maintenance&#13;
will prevent deterioration of the existing structures to continue, and avoid further increasing VOCs and cost of&#13;
future rehabilitation. In addition, maintenance of rural roads, which is by nature labor intensive and will be carried&#13;
out by small local contractors and village crews, will generate substantial employment opportunities and provide a&#13;
steady income to many local inhabitants. Since project works will be spread widely throughout Lesotho, most parts&#13;
of the country will benefit from the employment generated by the Project.&#13;
Costs: The economic analysis includes routine and periodic maintenance costs at a level sufficient to ensure that&#13;
estimated road-user savings from improved surfaces will indeed be realized. However, unit costs are relatively high&#13;
due to terrain conditions, and due to cost of labor for labor intensive works such as maintenance. There is some&#13;
uncertainty over those costs because few local contractors -who are to carry out the bulk of maintenance works-&#13;
have been employed until now. Base costs for rehabilitation and upgrading works have been estimated from recent&#13;
civil works contracts in the Roads Branch (RB) and Labor Construction Unit (LCU) estimates.&#13;
Economic Viability: As mentioned above, economic viability differs widely for major roads and rural low-volume&#13;
roads. Average daily traffic levels on most rural roads under consideration for upgrading are low at present,&#13;
particularly in the Highlands which are priority targets for improving access. This is due primarily to the poor&#13;
condition of roads. Therefore, a key variable in determining the required level of upgrading for the rural roads, and&#13;
the economic viability thereof, is the assumed rate of traffic increase. Without an increase in traffic levels,&#13;
substantial investments would not be viable. In order to maximize the likelihood that investment in rural roads&#13;
upgrading will at least be viable, even if not always optimal, and to stretch available resources as far as possible,&#13;
upgrading of gravel roads has been designed with regard to the minimum MOW 5-meter width standards, and 3.5-&#13;
meter width for earth tracks being built under the Civil Works Section (CWS) program. Geometric design&#13;
standards for roads to be rehabilitated will be kept to the original "as-built" standards. Upgrading of main gravel&#13;
roads to paved standards includes widening to standard widths justified by the high traffic volumes. Based on&#13;
minimal rehabilitation works and upgrading works adjusted to terrain and weather conditions, carefully assessed&#13;
unit costs for all categories of works, and reasonable assumptions as to future traffic volumes, the analysis indicates&#13;
that road works have an economic rate-of-return in excess of the estimated opportunity cost of capital (12%). It has&#13;
been assumed in the base case that traffic will gradually increase at a moderate average rate of 4%.&#13;
Methodology: Basic data required for input to the Pavement Maintenance Management System (PMMS) and the&#13;
HDM model was collected during preparatory studies and revised at appraisal. This comprised the network&#13;
inventory, surface types, pavement conditions, traffic volumes and distribution, unit costs of maintenance&#13;
operations, vehicle and fleet characteristics and vehicle operating costs. The attached table gives a summary of the&#13;
representative data on the road network, unit costs for the various categories of civil works. A more detailed&#13;
analysis of the input data is included in the Implementation Manual.&#13;

Annex N&#13;
Costs were considered in both financial and economic terms. The economic analysis used appropriate shadow&#13;
prices (after adjusting for taxes, and transfer payments). To convert the financial costs items to economic costs, the&#13;
following conversion factors were applied: (i) 81.3% for materials and transport and equipment to take account of&#13;
sales tax (GST), fuel taxes and the SACU tariffs; (ii) 50% for the labor cost on unpaved roads; and (iii) 75% for the&#13;
labor cost on paved roads, to take account of the different skill levels required to carry out works.&#13;
Projects in each category have been selected based on how they best fit the overall priorities of the program, and on&#13;
the following criteria: (i) a "corridor" rationale implying that all major links receive some kind of treatment to&#13;
ensure a certain level of continuity in the network, (ii) ongoing programs (Lesotho Highlands Water Project-&#13;
LHWP, LCU program, Development Fund program, and Food for Work Program-FWP), and (iii) road condition&#13;
and traffic flows. The analysis also considered: (i) the managerial capacity in MOW and in each regional office of&#13;
the RB, LCU and CWS, (ii) the availability of local contractors, and (iii) the availability of national and external&#13;
funding.&#13;
The economic analysis for the RB and LCU roads was conducted (para 4.2 of the SAR) using the IEP-developed&#13;
PMMS, after updating its data base in terms of traffic estimates and unit costs, traffic growth figure revised from&#13;
the National Transport Study (NTS) projections of 6 to 7% for the next five years to a more realistic 4%, and road&#13;
condition estimates for the CWS gravel and earth roads network which were not yet entered in the data base). The&#13;
analysis included a run of the Bank HDM program, which generally produced consistent results with the PMMS. A&#13;
reassessment of the vehicle characteristics and operating costs in terms of HDM III requirements has to be carried&#13;
out to calibrate the model for the Lesotho fleet. The RB-PMMS VOC data were determined for the customised&#13;
South African model. To determine the maintenance requirements for the network and the feasibility of&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of road links, the following process was carried out:&#13;
(3     Road functional and structural evaluation - uniform sections in terms of roughness and surface damage&#13;
were identified and the strengthening for a 15 year project period were determined;&#13;
(Z     Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Upgrading operations were identified and assigned to categories;&#13;
a3)    Unit Rates were reviewed based on material, labour and equipment components for each of the&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation activities included in the strategies;&#13;
()     The various interventions, their effect and unit costs, were defined and transferred to HDM III formats;&#13;
(J)    Thresholds for the condition and traffic responsive interventions were established for three service levels;&#13;
0      Strategies were established for each maintenance category, and assigned to the road sections.&#13;
tS3    HDM III performance simulation was carried out over 20 years for each road link subjected to routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading strategies.&#13;
The PMMS and HDM analysis also determined appropriate maintenance options for RB roads. The final selection&#13;
of maintenance works (periodic maintenance on roads and bridges in good or fair condition, and routine&#13;
maintenance extended on an increasing basis to the whole classified network) will be based on the PMMS results&#13;
(priority works to be carried out according to specific road deterioration factors found in Lesotho and emergency of&#13;
treatment), the potential for contracting out (assumed to be increasing over the five year period with the&#13;
development of local contractors, and improved managerial capacity of MOW), and available Road Fund resources.&#13;
A tentative maintenance program has been defined, based upon different maintenance activities required for each&#13;
type of road and surface.&#13;
A complete list showing all projects yielding a positive net present value (NPV) between years 1996 and 2015 is&#13;
included in the Implementation Manual. The final selection has focused on ensuring that investments made are&#13;
high priority, and major works (rehabilitation and upgrading) are all economically viable. The selection of roads to&#13;
undergo rehabilitation works (backlogged maintenance of gravel roads) was made, ensuring that there would not&#13;
be any overlapping with those selected for potential periodic maintenance, and emphasizing the need to rehabilitate&#13;
before embarking on a more comprehensive upgrading program. As described in Chapter IV of the SAR, the final&#13;
selection of upgrading works will be based on completed detailed engineering design, committed donors financing,&#13;
and further economic analyses for the eight major upgrading sub-projects.&#13;
The table below shows the expected average Internal Economic Rates of Return (IRR), NPVs and NPV/Cost ratios&#13;
for different types of works for the base case scenario, which assumes 4% traffic growth and a 12% discount rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex N&#13;
The historical traffic growth rate of 6% was not used, to take account of the uncertainty in traffic patterns which&#13;
may result from factors such as reduction of trade with South Africa and drought. The average ERR in all cases is&#13;
in excess of the estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%.&#13;

Rural road upgrading program: The analysis of the economics of low-volume CWS-managed rural roads reveals&#13;
economic rates of return often lower than 12%. The total length of rural roads to be upgraded by LCU to all-&#13;
weather standards is expected to be 400 km, mostly in Highlands districts. This is estimated to be about 30 percent&#13;
of the kilometrage of secondary and tertiary roads, and approximately 10 percent of the national network. Given&#13;
the large number of individual roads and the lack of complete data, a detailed economic analysis could not be&#13;
conducted for each road section. Instead, first a general analysis has been performed based on a screening process&#13;
by LCU which takes the following factors, both socio-economic and technical, into account: the road will be&#13;
classified as a LCU road, lack of roads within four kilometers, availability of labor, linkage to development&#13;
projects, location in an underdeveloped area, potential enhancement of agricultural productivity and augmenting&#13;
the standard of life, information on terrain (mountainous/hilly, flat or rolling), present condition (motorable, partly&#13;
motorable or not motorable), drainage structures, percent of road needing gravelling and sources of gravel. Once&#13;
this screening done, the second step consists of a priority ranking, according to the following standardized&#13;
prioritization criteria (population served, District Council priority ranking, and traffic level), defined as follows:&#13;
(i)    the District Development Councils (DDCs) were given a list of LCU roads within their district to&#13;
prioritize in accordance with local knowledge regarding access needs, social infrastructure, and rural&#13;
development initiatives, and these roads were ranked in order of importance by each DDC. A dialogue&#13;
with the newly elected Village Development Councils (VDCs) will be initiated under the project with&#13;
regard to the FWP and LHWP Development Fund programs,&#13;
(ii)    seven-day 12 hour traffic counts are regularly carried out on all motorable alignments, and were recently&#13;
checked as part of the elaboration of the PMMS under the IEP-financed project. Roads were ranked in&#13;
order of most-to-least traffic for each district; and&#13;
(iii)   population statistics (area population density, which also reflects the availability of casual workers) were&#13;
obtained for the corridor of influence for each road, as determined from the 1986 census.&#13;
The ranking procedure gave equal weightings to each of the above individual rankings, and the overall ranking&#13;
was arrived at by numerically summing the ranking given to each of the three items. The smaller the sum, the&#13;
greater the importance of the road. Developing a work program for a rural road network must, however, also&#13;
involve the balancing of a number of influencing factors such as: (i) connecting links between village access roads&#13;
and social facilities and transport corridors, emphasizing the increase in links and transport services within rural&#13;
areas; (ii) management and supervisory capability; and (iii) the need to preserve investment on substantially&#13;
maintainable roads. The final selection of roads to be upgraded in priority (416 km estimated with regard to LCU&#13;
and contractors capacity) therefore included a final review with regard to two criteria: (i) roads with AADTs over&#13;
50 and/or projects based on acceptable IRRs when available, and (ii) costs. To meet the broader GOL objectives&#13;
related to the promotion of labor intensive methods and improving access, a shadow price for labor and a factor&#13;
"length of good road per head of population" were included into the costing process, which did not bear a&#13;
significant impact on the ranking of the roads. The programs will be reviewed annually using the above-described&#13;
procedure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex N&#13;
Beneficiaries: From the above, the main beneficiaries will be road users in general (lower VOCs. improved access&#13;
roads), rural communities in isolated mountainous areas of the country (expanded all-weather year-round access to&#13;
basic services, jobs in maintenance and upgrading activities), and local contractors (stable flow of civil works&#13;
contracts, improved access to equipment, training and support to development of the industry).&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of: (i) variations from the basic unit&#13;
costs; (ii) variations from the initial normal-traffic volumes; and (iii) the effect of various discount rates. The&#13;
following table shows the results for two alternatives and the base case; one with 2% traffic growth rates, and one&#13;
with 6% traffic growth; and one with 8% discount rate and one with 16% discount rate. Results are shown for RB&#13;
rehabilitation program, and the RB upgrading to paved standards program. In all cases the project is economically&#13;
justified. The table below shows the estimated financial costs of the chosen option and the NPV and IRR in the&#13;
base case and in traffic and discount rate alternatives: (i) traffic growth rates of 2%. 4% and 6%, and (ii) discount&#13;
rates of 8%, 12 %, 16% and 20% for the paved roads and from 8%, 12% and 16 % for the unpaved roads.&#13;

Cost Recovery: A Road Fund (Annex C) has been established to recover maintenance and rehabilitation costs&#13;
from users through 4 charges (fuel charge, border fees, road-toll gate fees, supplementary licensing fee). The later&#13;
will apply to heavv vehicles, which have been found to be the only vehicles with a negative difference between&#13;
variable road maintenance costs and variable VOCs. i.e. creating more damages onto roads than paid for through&#13;
current fuel taxes. The Road Fund mechanism also includes cost-sharing arrangements for urban and village roads,&#13;
to extend benefits to local communities.&#13;

The number of LCU qualified contractors after 1999 could be lower depending on successful maintenance contractors being retrained&#13;
in roads upgrading, the number of remaining force account units, and the degree of competition introduced in the country&#13;

Annex P&#13;
LESOTHO&#13;
ROAD REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION&#13;
EA Screening&#13;
The Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project is in EA Category B which requires an&#13;
environmental evaluation and mitigation plan under the Bank OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment. In lieu&#13;
of national environmental assessment legislation which is being developed by the National Environmental&#13;
Secretariat, Bank guidelines were used for the environmental analysis for this project. Bank missions&#13;
discussed the development of EA legislation with the Environment Department in the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Natural Resources.&#13;
The project focuses on rehabilitation, maintenance and upgrading of existing roads and no new&#13;
roads will be constructed. Construction methods will employ labor intensive techniques using local labor&#13;
and small contractors which is commonly utilized in Lesotho under the Local Construction Unit of the&#13;
Ministry of Works (LCU). Negative environmental and social impacts due to the project are expected to be&#13;
minimal because of the focus on rehabilitation and non-mechanized construction, hence the EA&#13;
classification of Category B.&#13;
The primary environmental concems consist of erosion control and avoidance of destruction of&#13;
natural vegetation which may be rare or endangered in Lesotho. The primary social concems is disruption&#13;
of travel due to construction and the potential for disturbing or taking of agricultural land as a result of&#13;
construction.&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
With funding by SIDA, the Ministry of Works contracted a Socioeconomic and Environmental&#13;
Impact Analysis of the Local Construction Unit activities. The consultants were contracted locally. The&#13;
analysis consisted of a meter by meter environmental inspection of 10% of the roads rehabilitated by the&#13;
LCU and a survey of 496 households which wvere affected by the LCU road rehabilitation program. It was&#13;
decided that this on-going work would satisfy Bank requirements for environmental analysis and that any&#13;
further work would have been redundant.&#13;
The analysis found that generally the road rehabilitation work was adequate and that environmental&#13;
protection, while not a specific charge of the LCU, was routinely incorporated into design and contract&#13;
documents. Most of the households expressed satisfaction with the work and only a small percentage felt&#13;
that they lost land or amenities as a result of the road work. Surprisingly, only 11 of 496 households noted&#13;
any problems with erosion. One more serious environmental point was the failure to restore borrow areas to&#13;
a more useful condition. Far too often the borrow pits were simply abandoned causing hazards to humans&#13;
and livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex P&#13;
Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
The communities in the road corridors are ovenvhelmingly satisfied with the roads and the routes.&#13;
The communities value the improved accessibility and decreased travel time more than the potential for&#13;
commercial or economic development. The survey also shows that while the local construction policy is&#13;
appreciated in the communities, the direct and indirect impacts have been minimal because of the limited&#13;
number of households providing labor and the short duration. However, the survey does show that&#13;
improved skills from the construction was highly regarded by respondents. It was also noted that the LCU&#13;
employment was found to be very equitably distributed.&#13;
Given the steep gradient topography, high rainfall and erodable soils, erosion in Lesotho is a&#13;
natural part of the weathering process and would be quite severe without human habitation and use.&#13;
Farming and overgrazing make the erosion rate more intolerable and there is great concern that road work&#13;
does not unnecessarily contribute to more erosion. LCU roads tend to follow natural contours so that&#13;
erosion is reduced and good drainage where possible keeps the losses to acceptable limits. However, the&#13;
focus of the erosion control has been more on roadway protection and less on what happens to run off after&#13;
it leaves the roadway. This lack of attention to off-road protection does cause erosion losses in field below&#13;
the road and LCU must expand it's attention to more devices that will dissipate run-off energy as it leaves&#13;
the road.&#13;
The analysis did show that much of the environmental damage was due to a lack of, or deferred,&#13;
maintenance rather than to inappropriate design, construction techniques or materials. The lack of&#13;
systematic light maintenance leads to rapid deterioration of drainage structures which in turn increases the&#13;
likelihood of erosion problems.&#13;
A disquieting finding of the road inspection is that in several areas, vegetation had been&#13;
unnecessarily trampled by the construction crews and trucks. In some cases, the vegetation included Aloe.&#13;
One of the two species of Aloe in Lesotho is endemic to Lesotho and is an endangered species. The&#13;
construction crews have to be better trained in respect to protecting natural vegetation.&#13;
Mitigation&#13;
LCU has recently constructed two training centers for staff and local contractors. Part of the&#13;
training includes erosion control techniques. LCU has also agreed to review the Socio-economic and&#13;
Environmental Report and incorporate the recommendations into the training program. As a result, LCU is&#13;
likely to strengthen the components on erosion control. It is also likely that they will be able to add training&#13;
material on restoration of borrow areas and include requirements for such restoration in their contract&#13;
documents. LCU will seek assistance from the Environment Department of the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Natural Resources to include training components on recognition of valuable and endangered&#13;
vegetation. Assurances for these recommended practices will be sought during negotiations.&#13;
The most important aspect of mitigation for road rehabilitation work is to have on-site supervision&#13;
and monitoring with respect to environmental concerns. LCU will continue to improve in this area through&#13;
internal training at the training centers. The curriculum will be adjusted to include the materials&#13;
recommended in the socioeconomic and environmental impact study. Supervision forms could also be&#13;
amended to include certain environmental and social parameters for reporting from the field to&#13;
headquarters.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives of the Road
            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project are to support both
            continued economic growth and the government's poverty
            reduction strategy through: 1) developing the government
            capacity to regularly maintain the whole classified road
            network by the year 2000, and upgrade priority roads to
            improved serviceability standards; 2) improving access to
            isolated areas and basic services in district centers by
            facilitating road traffic, and lowering transport costs; 3)
            further developing the emerging private local road
            construction and maintenance industry, using mainly
            labor-based methods to generate productive employment; and
            4) strengthening the planning, implementation and management
            capacity of the Road Sector agencies, through policy and
            institutional reforms and capacity building support. The
            project will finance three major components over the July
            1996 to March 2001 period: 1) a civil works program focusing
            on maintenance, and including the rehabilitation of sections
            of the roads branch and labor construction unit network, and
            selected upgrading of selected priority roads; 2) design
            engineering and supervision services in support of the
            program; and 3) sector institutional reform and capacity
            building, including logistical support to the Ministry of Works.
