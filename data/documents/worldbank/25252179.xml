THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 10,510,566&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 17,795&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 36&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 33*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;

      notary fee is 0.2% (or 895 CZK at full amount). For a case study&#13;
      company with start up capital of CZK 3,447,359 the notary fee comes to&#13;
      16,695 CZK. The fees do not include VAT (21%).&#13;
&#13;
      In addition, if each founder wants their own original copy, then the cost&#13;
      is CZK 100 per page. Alternatively, instead of original copy a founder&#13;
      can ask for a certified copy and the cost would be 30 CZK per page.&#13;
      These costs are optional, and up to each founder to incur.&#13;
&#13;
      The company must also certify its building lease agreement by a public&#13;

      No. 300/2008 Coll., â&#128;&#156;On electronic transactions and authorized&#13;
      conversion of documents.â&#128;&#157; The Act requires all public and private&#13;
      entities to use an electronic data box for encrypted exchange of official&#13;
      documents and information. Pursuant to the Law, the data box for a&#13;
      legal entity (including a limited liability company) registered in the&#13;
      Trade License Office and /or Commercial Register is established&#13;
      automatically and free of charge by the Ministry of Interior, after it&#13;
      receives the information from the relevant registration authority.&#13;
      Alternatively, the company may set up a data box prior to official&#13;
      company registration with government authorities, via in person&#13;
      request at a Czech POINT contact point located in the post office.&#13;
&#13;
      In case the company chose to create the electronic data box prior to&#13;
      registration with the Trade License Office, it may apply for the trade&#13;
      license electronically, via the data box. However, most companies prefer&#13;

      The builder informs the Environmental Department that the&#13;
      project is a sub-limit construction by completing a specific form,&#13;
      which can be obtained online. This form can range from 1 to 60&#13;
      pages, depending on the size of the project. The Doing Business&#13;
      case study is considered low risk and a small project. The&#13;
      department will assess the impact of this sub-limit construction&#13;
      and decide whether the request should be granted or not. It is&#13;
      not automatic that all sub-limit constructions do not require a&#13;
      full Environmental Impact Assessment.&#13;

      This notification will be sent to several departments (pollution,&#13;
      waste, arable land/forest if applicable) to make sure that this&#13;
      project will not have a negative impact on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
      The statutory time limit is 15 days, but in reality the average time&#13;
      is around 30 days. By law, construction under 6000 sq.m. is&#13;
      considered sub-limit (Environmental Impact Assessment Act&#13;
      100/2001). This is also a harmonization of the EU regulations.&#13;

      This procedure is required by law â&#128;&#147; it is for safety reasons. The&#13;
      Road and Management Agency will check that the builder is&#13;
      respecting all the requirements when connecting to the public&#13;
      road and will verify if the project will have an impact on traffic.&#13;
      Even if it is just a small connection to the public road, BuildCo&#13;
      will still require the clearance.                                      20 days       CZK 500&#13;

      Obtain zoning permit&#13;
&#13;
      A zoning permit grants only the right to build the warehouse on&#13;
      a plot; it does not authorize construction. In order to obtain the&#13;
      location permit, BuildCo must submit the clearances of the&#13;
      preliminary project design by the various agencies.&#13;
&#13;
      The zoning permit is valid for 2 years, and it is a prerequisite for&#13;
      construction and building permits. The statutory period for&#13;
      completing the procedure is 60 days. In particular, the District&#13;
      authority should take a maximum of 30 days to assess all the&#13;
      clearances and provide an opinion. Then there is a statutory time&#13;
      limit of 15 days for the participants to receive the opinion from&#13;
      the District authority. Since it is a registered mailed, if the person&#13;
      does not pick it up immediately at the post office , it will be&#13;
      considered received after 15 days, whether or not the person has&#13;
      the letter physically in their hands. Then, the participants ( such&#13;
      as the neighbors) have another 15 days time-limit to appeal this         60 days      CZK 20,000&#13;
8&#13;
      zoning opinion. If no appeal is received within these 15 days,&#13;
      then the zoning permit is considered final and indisputable.&#13;
      However, in more complicated cases that require oral&#13;
      proceedings or local investigations, the statutory period for&#13;
      completing the procedure is 90 days.&#13;
      The zoning permit must be issued for simple structures,&#13;
      installations, and maintenance. However, if a regulatory plan (a&#13;
      more specific document than the master plan) is issued for the&#13;
      area (location), this plan replaces the zoning permit within that&#13;
      area. The regulatory plan is procured and issued by the Local&#13;
      Authority. It determines the detailed conditions for the use of the&#13;
      grounds, for the location and spatial arrangement of structures,&#13;
      for the protection of areaâ&#128;&#153;s values and character, and for creating&#13;

        The request is made to the local water and sewerage provider.&#13;
        The costs for establishing a (completely new) water connection is&#13;
        about CZK 2,500.00 â&#128;&#147; CZK 3,000.00 per sq. m. for the excavation&#13;
        works (depending on the surface material), plus the cost of the&#13;
        actual placing of the new water conduct and coverage of the&#13;
        hole, (together, about CZK 4,500.00 per sq. m.). The costs of&#13;
        establishing a new sewerage connection are based on the same&#13;
        criteria, and they can vary substantially, based on the relevant&#13;
        circumstances (surface material, depth). The costs for&#13;
        establishing the new water connection depends on the time and&#13;
        the number of workers needed. The price is about CZK 2,200.00&#13;
  21    plus VAT (21%), calculated on an hourly basis for two workers. It     30 days       CZK 5,500&#13;
        is assumed this would take 5 -- 6 hours.&#13;
&#13;
        For the excavation work, a company is responsible for being in&#13;
        contractual relation with the Prague Water Supply and Sewerage&#13;
        Company (Prazske vodovody a kanalizace). The fee for the water&#13;
        and sewerage connection varies, by service provider. However,&#13;
        the approximate cost is about CZK 1,200.00. The cost stated&#13;
        above probably includes the cost for constructing the water and&#13;
        sewerage connection. However, when constructing a warehouse,&#13;
        the constructor also builds a water and sewerage connection.&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;

        The customer submits an application, which is time-stamped to show the&#13;
        date and time of application. This application will go to the IT support&#13;
        department to be processed. A letter stating the location of the&#13;
        warehouse, required load, type of consumption (electric heating, air&#13;
        conditioning, etc.) and a map of the location of the specified resolution.&#13;
        The utility responds to the application by providing a map/drawing of&#13;
        the proposed connection of the building to the PREdistribuce network.&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;

and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

       The buyer checks for encumbrances on the property&#13;
&#13;
       It is the responsibility of the buyer to verify whether the property has any&#13;
       encumbrances on it. If there are some encumbrances, those must be&#13;
       stated in the sale/purchase agreement.&#13;
       While the land registry will also check on the encumbrances, however, if        1 day                CZK 100&#13;

       A notary certifies the signatures of the transfer agreement&#13;
&#13;
       By law, the transfer agreement does not have to be executed in the form&#13;
       of notarial deed and the signatures of the contractual parties on the&#13;
       transfer agreement do not have to be certified. However, the Cadastral&#13;
       Office must verify (as specified by law) the identity of the parties and&#13;
       manifestation of their will. Therefore, it is useful and common practice to                        CZK 30 each&#13;

&#13;
        Parties apply for registration at the Cadastral Office of Prague (Registry)&#13;
        after gathering all the documentation. There is a lump sum fee payable&#13;
        together with the application to register the property in the amount of&#13;
        CZK 1000, which is paid by buying stamps at the Registry.&#13;
        After the application is received, the adjudication procedure will take&#13;
        about 60 days as specified by law. In practice, it takes about 22 days in&#13;
        Prague.&#13;
        When the procedure is over, a notification of the transfer of ownership is&#13;
        issued. The Registry delivers the transfer agreements to the parties with a&#13;
        remark on the transfer agreement.&#13;
&#13;
        The documentation requirements are as follow:                                               CZK 1,000&#13;

        number of parties plus two counterparts (originals or certified copies), in&#13;
        this case 4 counterparts (signatures certified in Procedure 1)&#13;
        (ii) If the transfer agreement was not signed by the persons authorized&#13;
        by law to act on behalf of the companies, powers of attorneys with&#13;
        certified signatures shall be attached.&#13;
        (iii) If the application is filed by proxy, power of attorney shall be&#13;

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Czech Republic
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Czech
            Republic. To allow for useful comparison, the profile also
            provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 Czech Republic ranks 36. A high ease of
            doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is
            more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
