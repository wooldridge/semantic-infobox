INDIA&#13;
STATES' ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
I. Institutional Setting&#13;
1.    The Government of India (GOI)'s strategy of supporting priority road infrastructure investment&#13;
proposals by the states (alongside those for National Highways needs) was initiated in 1992/93, as part of&#13;
the evolution of India's program of economic reforms and liberalization. In this context, the GOI's&#13;
Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) played a strategic role in the establishment in September, 1993&#13;
by the Bank of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for the State of Haryana to assist with the costs of&#13;
preparing a major highways upgrading and rehabilitation project aimed at eventual Bank financing (the&#13;
first such PPF initiated for India). The strategy's overall objectives are, as agreed between GOI and the&#13;
Bank from the outset, to combine preparations for major improvements in state-level road infrastructure&#13;
with measures designed to achieve significant sectoral institutional strengthening and future sustainability&#13;
of road network assets.&#13;
2.     The preparations in Haryana and subsequently in Andhra Pradesh have taken longer than&#13;
originally anticipated, however, DEA and the Center's nodal ministry for the sector, the Ministry of&#13;
Surface Transport (MOST), have continued their explicit support for and promotion of this strategy.&#13;
Several states have now responded with their own substantive proposals for similar Bank-assisted&#13;
investment project preparation and implementation.&#13;
3.     While the overall strategy has been established and promoted through the central government, the&#13;
responsibility for actually implementing the strategy (through the medium of suitable Project vehicles&#13;
and/or various sector policy interventions) rests with the individual states, as road transport is a field of&#13;
concurrent constitutional responsibility between Center and states. In this sector, the main implementing&#13;
and execution capacities have historically been located in the states' roads agencies (mostly still termed&#13;
Public Works Departments, or PWDs, on the basis of their diverse works and services functions as&#13;
'Engineer to the State').&#13;
4.     Apart from their substantial administrative and field-labor echelons, these PWDs are staffed by&#13;
career engineering officials whose career mobility is generally limited to the particular state PWD context&#13;
and whose advancement is determined largely by seniority. Their skills base rarely includes non-&#13;
engineering expertise (e.g. in economics, law, environmental or social sciences) and the resources and&#13;
opportunities for staff development are generally limited. Their internal technical resources are&#13;
frequently outdated and there is little effective computerization of processes and information. At the&#13;
same time, there is still only limited usage of available private sector engineering, construction and&#13;
maintenance resources, with considerable in-house provision of such services remaining.&#13;
5.    Most aspects of the PWDs' project and program management activities suffer from a lack of up-&#13;
to-date in-depth capacities, inappropriate technology and/or inadequate finances, resulting in significant&#13;
inefficiencies, quality and performance problems in key areas such as road maintenance, investment&#13;
planning and implementation. The financial and technical policies and practices determining the PWDs'&#13;
activities in roads planning, construction and maintenance are, in principle, based on contemporary norms&#13;
and standards promulgated India-wide by bodies such as MOST, the Finance Commission and/or the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Indian Road Congress. In practice, however, these norms and standards are often unrealistic for the&#13;
actual circumstances and needs in the sector and thus do not result in effective design, construction or&#13;
maintenance outputs. The pervasive financial constraints in the sector and the PWDs' limited capacity for&#13;
effective quality control, financial and performance accountability in works implementation and&#13;
maintenance operations also undermine the quality otherwise possible under the existing norms and&#13;
policies.&#13;
6.     Most state governments and their PWDs have recognized their difficulties in meeting current&#13;
demands for financing, provision and maintenance of major road network infrastructure, and have begun&#13;
to implement some policy reforms and institutional strengthening measures. However, their efforts have&#13;
so far been limited in scope and impact, and inhibited by the lack of wider institutional support and by&#13;
major ongoing financial constraints.&#13;
7.     The roads sector in India is facing a crucial threshold, where the undoubted need for major&#13;
physical investments in road infrastructure is matched by the widespread appreciation of the need for&#13;
major sector policy and institutional reforms and capacity building. Both the Center and the States now&#13;
show a broad commitment to change in the key institutional, operational and financing aspects of the&#13;
sector. However, without the impetus of GOI's strategic support and without external financial assistance&#13;
which explicitly targets these areas of 'institutional investment', major performance constraints and&#13;
weaknesses will prevail in this sector.&#13;
8.    Accordingly, under this project, the Bank-financed TA for a State's road infrastructure investment&#13;
preparations would be paralleled by Bank-financed TA supporting the State's efforts to develop and&#13;
implement policy-based reforms aimed at future sustainability in the State's capacities for road&#13;
infrastructure financing and facilitation, asset maintenance and overall sector management. The TA-&#13;
supported interventions and capacity-building measures needed to achieve this will be identified as early&#13;
as possible, for action in parallel with the planned TA-supported road infrastructure investment&#13;
preparations.&#13;
H. Project Description&#13;
9.    The project will enable financing of TA support to individual States' road infrastructure&#13;
investment preparations via two main components:&#13;
(a)    The project preparation and implementation support component under which&#13;
financial assistance will be provided by GOI to individual States for investment project&#13;
preparations, and in particular to help meet the costs of:&#13;
(i)    preparation of techno-economic feasibility studies, all preliminary engineering,&#13;
sufficient final engineering designs to enable commencement of at least the first&#13;
two years' construction program immediately upon a future Loan's effectiveness,&#13;
and all associated procurement preparations, to meet Bank project appraisal and&#13;
approval requirements;&#13;
(ii)   comprehensive preparation of the associated Environment and Social Impact&#13;
screenings and assessments, appropriate R&amp;R Action Plans and policy measures,&#13;
to GOI and Bank project appraisal and approval requirements;&#13;
(iii)   assistance with initial capacity-building in the project management and&#13;
implementation capacities and resources of the PWD/roads agencies, including&#13;
for roads-related social and environmental responsibilities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(iv)   facilitation of and support for appropriate workshops, inter-state networking,&#13;
training, study tours and/or pilot studies, projects and/or programs to demonstrate&#13;
and/or resolve:&#13;
*   'best practice' in approaches to critical areas of project preparation, (e.g.,&#13;
social or environment matters), and&#13;
*   new methods, practices and/or technology to be used in preparation of the&#13;
planned project works.&#13;
(b)    The policy support and institutional development component under which financial&#13;
assistance will be provided by GOI to individual States for TA support to substantive&#13;
actions on planning and implementation of measures for policy-based reforms and&#13;
institutional strengthening in each State's roads maintenance, road network management,&#13;
roads sector financing, investment planning and implementation functions. In particular,&#13;
this TA financing will help meet the costs of:&#13;
(i)    development of strategies and time-bound action plans, based on relevant&#13;
'best practice' in this field, for major sustainable improvements in the&#13;
main policy, financial, organizational and skills aspects of the State's&#13;
road infrastructure development, maintenance and management&#13;
capacities;&#13;
(ii)   TA-supported networking, staff exchanges/secondments, domestic and/or&#13;
overseas study initiatives and workshops within and between the&#13;
participating states, aimed at accelerating, exchanging and consolidating&#13;
the experiences and skills being gained in the States during this project in&#13;
institutional and financial reform and capacity-building for the roads sub-&#13;
sector; and&#13;
(iii)  financial, legal and/or other expert services for development of policy&#13;
and other enabling measures by the State(s) for more effective private&#13;
sector investment and participation in road infrastructure provision.&#13;
There will be a small, separate project management component to finance the consultancy services&#13;
required to assist DEA in its carriage of overall project implementation management.&#13;
10.   All TA-supported activities in these two main components would be implemented within an&#13;
agreed Project Identification &amp; Preparation Framework (PIPF), which comprehensively outlines the&#13;
various Bank requirements for sound project preparation, the mutual Bank/GOI aims for reforms and&#13;
improvements in sector capacities and performance to be addressed in institutional strengthening&#13;
components of such project preparations, and the necessary preliminary actions to be taken by individual&#13;
states to facilitate rational pre-selection and planning of proposed investments during project preparations.&#13;
A copy of the current 'model PIPF' is provided at Attachment 1. An early example of the PIPF approach&#13;
in application is the proposed State Highway Project I (a.k.a. Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project,&#13;
IN-PA-9995), for which the Project Information Document is at Attachment 6.&#13;
11.   Under the project, the TA financing would be concentrated (but not limited to) on the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
* preparation to Bank project appraisal standards -by the States of the technical, economic,&#13;
social, environment and procurement components of their road infrastructure investment&#13;
proposals, using comprehensive intemationally-experienced consulting services, aimed at&#13;
resolving all pre-construction preparations, clearances and other issues for at least the first&#13;
two years' construction program by the anticipated Loan approval;&#13;
*   implementation via the PCC services and/or other TA forms of pilot studies, demonstration&#13;
projects, training and/or development programs for the application and transfer of&#13;
international 'best practice' roads planning, design and construction methods, skills and&#13;
technology, during the overall preparations for the State's planned subsequent investment&#13;
project(s);&#13;
*   identification of measures to progressively shift the procurement and implementation&#13;
approaches in the roads sector towards the increased privatization of engineering,&#13;
construction execution and supervision services in road works and maintenance activities,&#13;
from current PWD 'in-house' approaches;&#13;
*   preparation of relevant institutional change strategies, and implementation of early catalytic&#13;
measures therein, to strengthen the states' roads maintenance and roads management&#13;
policies, capacities and performance, including on environmental and social aspects, which&#13;
inter alia shift the main sector agencies from a 'services provider' to 'sector manager' role in&#13;
relation to the states' needs, and support for implementation of substantive 'first steps';&#13;
*   identification of policy and other changes required for sustainable higher public funding for&#13;
road maintenance needs and support for implementation of substantive 'first steps';&#13;
-   development of policy and administrative measures for more effective facilitation of private&#13;
sector investment and participation in state-level road infrastructure;&#13;
-   facilitation of any pilot projects/programs, studies and/or surveys to test and demonstrate key&#13;
new concepts, mechanisms, techniques and/or technologies relevant to the sector, including&#13;
via minor-scale civil works;&#13;
*   procurement and implementation of essential equipment or goods for priority capacity-&#13;
building measures in sector agencies; and&#13;
*   facilitation of and attendance at intra-state, regional and/or overseas seminars, study tours,&#13;
workshops and/or training initiatives on substantive aspects of proposed sector and&#13;
institutional reforms.&#13;
12.    TA Delivery Mode: The consultancy services and TA typically required by each State for&#13;
investment project preparations handled in accordance with the PIPF would be integrated as a unified&#13;
package of Project Coordinating Consultant (PCC) services. In these packages, internationally-&#13;
experienced firms (usually with domestic associates and/or sub-contractors) will provide the full range of&#13;
engineering, economic, financial, procurement, social and environment skills necessary to support&#13;
individual states in planning and executing comprehensive project preparations which should satisfy Bank&#13;
project appraisal requirements. The PCC firms are required to provide personnel with wide international&#13;
experience and strong qualifications for all key positions in the delivery of the services. The PCC&#13;
services would normally be procured in accordance with Terms of Reference (TOR) adapted by each&#13;
State (with Bank review) from the 'model TOR' developed by the Bank on the basis of previous&#13;
operational experience in this sector and disseminated to the states with GOI's assistance. These 'model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
TOR' at least cover the respective fields of full project feasibility analysis; preliminary and detailed&#13;
engineering design; procurement preparations; project management assistance to the client PWD;&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Action Plan (EAP) preparation; Social Impact&#13;
assessment, R&amp;R policy development support and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) preparation. The&#13;
respective requirements of the Bank's Operational Directives 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30 are fully addressed in&#13;
these TOR. The 'model TOR' have been lodged with the Bank's Public Information Center for general&#13;
public access, suitably annotated to identify their status as a 'living document' likely to evolve further.&#13;
13.   The duration of such PCC services will vary according to the size and complexity of each State's&#13;
planned investment preparations, but typically will be of the order of 15-18 months for the Phase I&#13;
segment (covering support to the client State to the stage of Bank project appraisal). Any continuation of&#13;
PCC services thereafter (into Phase 2) can be facilitated directly within the original PCC contract, but is&#13;
subject to (a) the outcome of Bank project appraisal and (b) the prerogatives of the individual State, based&#13;
on the client's satisfaction (or otherwise) with performance of the PCC services in Phase 1.&#13;
14.    The individual states' requirements for TA support for development and implementation of sector&#13;
reforms and institutional strengthening are expected to vary considerably, according to each State's sector&#13;
circumstances and the status of reform initiatives there. Accordingly, the consultancy services and/or TA&#13;
forms required under this project component may need to be secured from a variety of sources, not&#13;
necessarily included in the PCC-style packaging of consultancy services outlined above. The scope,&#13;
diversity and pace of these TA-supported reforms will need to be determined on a case-by-case basis by&#13;
each State.&#13;
15.   Priority Areas for Reforms: Initial reform 'targets', taking into account the combination of&#13;
technical, operational and financing norms already promulgated (but generally not well applied) in India&#13;
and the typical performance indicators for comparable roads sector functions overseas, should at least&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)    improved procurement, contract and project management performance, in terms&#13;
of turn-around times for decision-making and implementation, processing of&#13;
payments, securing essential inter-agency clearances and actions, etc.;&#13;
(b)   the development of effective basic road management information (traffic counts,&#13;
road condition surveys, etc.) and preparations for implementation of a&#13;
suitable Road Management System which integrates this data with cost,&#13;
budgeting and monitoring functions, as well as signaling objective priorities for&#13;
maintenance;&#13;
(c)    improved road maintenance effectiveness, based initially on monitoring of&#13;
annual maintenance quality and quantity against outlays and subsequent&#13;
measures to improve policies, annual financing levels and sources of finance,&#13;
standards, methods of execution and forms of procurement for road maintenance&#13;
services;&#13;
(d)    strengthened road infrastructure planning and project development and&#13;
implementation capacity, inclusive of roads-related social and environmental&#13;
planning, within the State's road agency and in key counterpart state-level&#13;
bodies;&#13;
(e)    improved traffic capacity management and road transport regulation for more&#13;
effective utilization of available road capacity; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
(f)    increased road infrastructure financing through improved cost-recovery and&#13;
revenue generation, increased public budget allocations, improved output&#13;
efficiency from present budgets, and greater value for money in road&#13;
maintenance results.&#13;
16.   Typical services for studies to help individual states to develop viable options for institutional,&#13;
financing and/or road maintenance reforms and the related implementation strategies/plans would be of 4-&#13;
6 months' duration, involving a combination of international and domestic experts in the relevant&#13;
technical, financial, institutional and operational fields.&#13;
17.    Training and Staff Development: Proposals for project TA outlays on training and development&#13;
of an individual State's staff (and where appropriate, local road engineering and construction industry&#13;
representatives and stakeholders) will mainly be for short-term project-oriented skill development needs.&#13;
The main focus in such TA financing will in each State be on:&#13;
(a)    the extension and consolidation of agency and sector capacities for key project&#13;
and/or sector management functions, particularly those needed for satisfactory&#13;
implementation of the planned future Bank-assisted investment project; and&#13;
(b)   the effective transfer and implementation of new concepts, systems, techniques&#13;
and/or technologies in agency and sector activities.&#13;
Such training may be conducted 'on-site' in the participating states or (as necessary) involve attendance at&#13;
appropriate interstate, regional or overseas technical institutions and conferences. However, in all cases&#13;
the training will be expected to be have clear project-related objectives, involve areas of high priority&#13;
needs in the sector as determined between the state authorities and the Bank, and have measurable&#13;
outcomes in corporate and/or individual performance terms, for subsequent monitoring by the State&#13;
concerned.&#13;
M11. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
18.   Project Cost and Financial Allocations: The total project cost, inclusive of taxes and&#13;
contingencies, is estimated to be US$68.0 million. Project financing would be as follows: IBRD Loan of&#13;
US$51.5 million, a contribution by the States amounting to US$1.5 million for the financing of the&#13;
necessary dedicated Project Management resources to be implemented by each participating State; and a&#13;
further aggregate contribution of about US$15.0 million by the participating States, to meet the levies&#13;
and/or tax liabilities due on fees and payments to foreign consultants. Retroactive financing limited to&#13;
US$5.0 million for eligible payments made from July 1, 1996, will be provided where advance&#13;
procurement of PCC services has been essential to enable some states to effectively initiate and/or extend&#13;
the implementation of their project preparations planned for TA financing under this Project, following&#13;
Bank review and agreement, where such preparations are not already covered by an existing Project&#13;
Preparation Facility. The project will include US$40.5 million for Project Preparation and&#13;
Implementation Support, US$12. 15 million for Policy Support and Institutional Development, and&#13;
US$0.35 million for the consultancy services required by GOI to assist DEA in carrying out the&#13;
abovementioned 'process management' role in the project's implementation effectively.&#13;
19.   The proposed initial allocations of project funds to individual States per project component and in&#13;
aggregate, pending the progressive completion by individual states of the project's entry/participation&#13;
conditions, are indicated at Attachment 2. Further breakdown of the likely funding of anticipated&#13;
segments and activities is not possible at this stage, as the identification of these can generally take place&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
only after each participating State has:&#13;
(a)    determined the broad scope and requirements of its particular sector reforms&#13;
agenda, in consultation with GOI and the Bank; and&#13;
(b)    confirmed the initial size and complexity of its planned investment project&#13;
preparations, as the basis for estimating the scope and value of the required PCC&#13;
consultancy services.&#13;
20.   Procurement and Disbursement: The financing plan for the Project is shown in Schedule A.&#13;
The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the expected disbursement schedule&#13;
under the Project are given at Schedule B. Except as specified, all procurement of works will be done in&#13;
accordance with International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and all procurement of consultant&#13;
services will be in accordance with World Bank guidelines.&#13;
IV. Project Implementation and Administration&#13;
21.   Main Project Activities/Milestones: The sequence of key project activities typically expected&#13;
between DEA, individual participating States seeking Bank TA financing ab initio via this facility and the&#13;
13ank, from the time of this TA Project's effectiveness until the aimed-at Bank Board presentation of that&#13;
State's fully prepared road infrastructure investment project, is outlined schematically at Attachment 3. A&#13;
summary of the agreed reporting and monitoring scope and indicators for this Project's main components&#13;
is at Attachment 4.&#13;
22.   Implementing and Executing Agencies: The GOI's project implementing agency will be the&#13;
Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Ministry of Finance. However, substantive project&#13;
implementation and execution responsibilities will be carried mainly by the participating States through&#13;
their PWD or road agencies, who will be responsible for preparing and implementing the TA Loan-&#13;
supported components.&#13;
23.   Eligibility for TA Financing: All states who commit themselves to the objectives and conditions&#13;
of the Project through completion of a Participation Agreement with GOI will be eligible for financing of&#13;
such Technical Assistance as is agreed between them, GOI and the Bank. The Bank will approve&#13;
individual states' applications to TA financing for agreed activities under the Project on a case-by -case&#13;
basis, after the State Government has:&#13;
(a)    committed itself to an agenda of policy, institutional and sector-financing&#13;
reforms, satisfactory to GOI and the Bank;&#13;
(b)    undertaken to handle any project preparations, studies, works and other activities&#13;
financed with TA under this project, in accordance with the agreed PIPF; and&#13;
(c)    accepted, for the main forms of TA-supported activities, the application of&#13;
Terms of Reference (TOR) derived from the 'model TOR' provided by the&#13;
Bank, suitably adapted to each State's specific requirements after Bank review.&#13;
24.   The Special Category States in India (such as Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur and Himachal Pradesh,&#13;
etc.) who have negligible revenue sources of their own and whose public budgets are sustained mainly&#13;
through Grants from the Central Government, may also seek TA financing under this project for&#13;
preparation of their roads upgrading proposals for a possible Bank-financed project, consistent with&#13;
ongoing GOI policy aimed at opening up such remote areas and at all-round socio-economic integration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
of these states' peoples with the rest of India. Subject to the development of appropriate project&#13;
preparation strategies for combinations of these states, and following each such State's acceptance of the&#13;
general principles of the Project Identification &amp; Preparation Framework, a specially-modified approach&#13;
to the typical Project Coordination Consultant (PCC) services (inclusive of some form of SOS) will be&#13;
finalized with such states, perhaps as a single multi-state 'package' of PCC services. In parallel, they&#13;
would jointly establish a multi-state Authorized Group of empowered officials to carry out the 'client'&#13;
role in procurement and management of (e.g.) the main PCC services.&#13;
25.   Participation Agreements: Proceeds of the TA Loan may be used by the participating states&#13;
under a Participation Agreement established between GOI and the individual State, to be finalized once a&#13;
State Government has satisfied this Project's eligibility conditions. The Participation Agreement will&#13;
detail the framework and operation of the TA Loan and the obligations of the participating State, as well&#13;
as the expectation of the application of the PIPF and the 'model TOR' (as available and as adapted) in&#13;
TA-supported activities under this project.&#13;
26.    Responsibility of the Implementing Agency (DEA): The DEA will be responsible for the&#13;
overall processing and monitoring of the states' access to the proceeds of the TA Loan, and for&#13;
translating GOI's support (as appropriate) for the building of a pipeline of states' road infrastructure&#13;
project proposals for Bank financing, and to ensure that the commitments made in the Participation&#13;
Agreements are honored.&#13;
27.    Responsibility of the Participating States: The participating State Governments will be&#13;
required: (i) to advise, in writing, the features and policy basis of the State's intended roads sector&#13;
institutional and financing reforms; and (ii) to undertake to:&#13;
(a)    conduct all project preparatory studies and activities (as outlined in the PIPF)&#13;
along 'best practice' lines and (as appropriate) to comply with the relevant Bank&#13;
Operational Directives (OD), particularly OD's 4.01, 4.20 and 4.30;&#13;
(b)   promptly make appropriate budgetary allocation of funds to cover all&#13;
expenditures connected with the project preparations, including any increased&#13;
budgets for road maintenance and financing, if applicable;&#13;
(c)    obtain the Bank's 'no objection' for specific activities at specified stages; and&#13;
(d)    from the outset, establish dedicated Project Management resources and a&#13;
suitable Secretary-level Empowered/Steering Committee (EC) to monitor and&#13;
guide all aspects of the State's reform/institutional strengthening program and&#13;
investment project preparations, to provide necessary approvals for the major&#13;
procurement activities, and resolve any inter-departmental issues/difficulties.&#13;
28.    Relationship of Each State's Executing Agency(-ies) With Other Entities: Each State's road&#13;
agency (or PWD) will be expected to consult stakeholders who may be substantially affected by impacts&#13;
arising out of the proposed investments that follow the studies, and take into consideration their views in&#13;
project formulation. The stakeholders would include persons whose lands or livelihood would be affected&#13;
by acquisition or by enhanced property valuations and taxes, environmental and social non-government&#13;
organizations (NGOs) working in the area, and the state authorities responsible for forests, environment,&#13;
cultural heritage, utilities and overall state economic and industrial planning.&#13;
29.    Duration of TA Loan and Reviews: The TA loan facility will have a five-year life from Loan&#13;
effectiveness. There will be an entry cut-off for any further state candidates for assistance at the end of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
three years following Loan effectiveness. A mid-term review will be carried out jointly by DEA and the&#13;
Bank before June 30, 1999. Annual reviews of the funds utilization position in the Loan will commence&#13;
no later than December 15, 1998, in order to respond to any cases of significant funds under-utilization&#13;
and any cases of need for increased funds allocation, based on the strong performance of a state in&#13;
reforms implementation and project preparations and its proven requirement for increased TA financing.&#13;
30.    Role of the Bank During Project Implementation: The role of the Bank would be to: approve&#13;
the candidate states for accessing the TA Loan funds; supervise the project preparation activities; provide&#13;
clearances after review for the environmental and social assessments; approve the list of prioritized roads&#13;
to be included for detailed feasibility studies financed under the project; provide 'no objection' for&#13;
procurement of consultants and other TA services; review each State's selection of roads for final detailed&#13;
engineering as the basis for project appraisal; provide advice on enhancement of road sector activities and&#13;
outputs, particularly on the more generic problems of the sector and comparable international 'best&#13;
practice'; and reimburse eligible expenditures from the TA Loan, on application by GOI.&#13;
31.    Budget Provisions: The state governments will be required to make advance budgetary&#13;
provision for all expenditures connected with the project preparation, including the tax liability in respect&#13;
of the foreign fee payments. They may seek reimbursement of eligible expenditures through the&#13;
Controller of Aid Accounts and Audits (CAAA), DEA.&#13;
32.    Eligible Expenditures: Subject to availability of funds, the TA Loan will finance the following&#13;
eligible expenditures:&#13;
(a)    consultant fees for feasibility studies, social and environmental preparations,&#13;
detailed engineering preparation, and sector development studies;&#13;
(b)    fees and costs involved in agreed training, travel, consultancy advice, systems&#13;
and technoiogy improvements, studies, seminars, workshops and/or other project&#13;
preparation needs;&#13;
(c)    essential equipment, materials, services and/or capital costs for&#13;
pilot/test/demonstration projects/studies/works; and&#13;
(d)    consultancy services for DEA's 'process management' functions in the&#13;
implementation of the Project.&#13;
The State Governments will be expected to use their own funds to fully meet expenditure on the tax&#13;
liability arising out of foreign currency payments to consultants, and normally also to meet the costs of&#13;
preparation of the preliminary Strategic Options Study (SOS).&#13;
33.    Loan Reimbursements and the Special Account: All eligible expenditures will be reimbursed&#13;
from the proceeds of the TA Loan. A Special Accoint of US$3 million will be established, at the Reserve&#13;
Bank of India (RBI), to meet anticipated expenditures of about four months. Eligible payments greater&#13;
than US$ 1,000,000 or of value greater than one third of the Special Account amount, may be paid by the&#13;
Bank directly to suppliers, at the specific request of GOI. The Special Account will be replenished on the&#13;
basis of reimbursement claims for eligible expenditures received by the Bank. The expenditures will be&#13;
reimbursed to the states by GOI under its standard policy on release of external assistance funds to the&#13;
states.&#13;
34.    Project Implementation Reporting and Monitoring: For project management purposes, a&#13;
detailed program of activities will be prepared by the Borrower within six (6) months of Loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
effectiveness, indicating clearly the responsibilities of the various parties, the time for commencement&#13;
and completion of each individual activity and the projected completion date for all activities. The&#13;
reporting based thereon will be due with the Bank quarterly and annually in formats satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, consistent with the requirements outlined at Attachment 4. This will, inter alia, be based on&#13;
monitoring between the Borrower and the participating States to be facilitated by computerized means&#13;
using 'critical path' project monitoring/management software.&#13;
35.   The following project implementation milestones should be included in such reporting:&#13;
* Finalization between DEA and each State of a Participation Agreement&#13;
* Development of a procurement plan by each state covering major items to be procured, their&#13;
approximate values, the method and timing of procurement&#13;
* GOI and/or State budget provisions to facilitate project expenditures&#13;
* Accounting and audit requirements for project expenditure&#13;
* Key stages in each State's investment project preparations and sector institutional and&#13;
financing reform plans&#13;
* Anticipated timing of Bank project appraisal in each participating state&#13;
* Annual Bank/DEA 'project allocations review', starting December 1998&#13;
*  Mid-term review of the project, prior to June 30, 1999&#13;
* Loan closure, December 31, 2001&#13;
* Completion of draft Implementation Completion Report, June 2002&#13;
36.   Progress Monitoring indicators: These will be applied progressively to assess the effectiveness&#13;
of the TA Loan's utilization and whether the Loan objectives are being met. These will include but not&#13;
necessarily be limited to the following (adapted as necessary between the Borrower and the Bank):&#13;
(a)    Measures of to be reported centrally on overall Project progress:&#13;
*  The number of states that have contracted PCC services&#13;
*  The number of states that initiate TA-supported studies on key sector reforms&#13;
*  The number of states that adopt an action plan arising from studies on sector reforms&#13;
*  The number of feasibility studies and environmental assessments completed&#13;
*  The number of detailed engineering packages completed and volume of roads covered&#13;
therein for subsequent planned investment&#13;
*  The number of states' proposed projects appraised by the Bank&#13;
*  The number and value of states' projects approved for Bank financing&#13;
(b)    Measures to be reported per State and overall:&#13;
*  Percentage increase in maintenance budget relative to 1996197&#13;
*  Person-days of training completed&#13;
*  The rate of utilization of TA funds (as a percentage of committed contracts)&#13;
*  Timeliness of payment (average number of days between submission of claims and&#13;
payment, for all relevant claims in the reporting period)&#13;
*  Timeliness of procurement events (aggregate days behind or ahead of procurement&#13;
schedule, averaged over all procurement actions)&#13;

INDIA&#13;
STATES' ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
MODEL PROJECT EDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION F1RAMEWORK&#13;
(PIPF)&#13;
Objective and Strategy&#13;
I.    The overall objective of the Bank's assistance is to improve the beneficiary State's road&#13;
transport infrastructure (physical network, operations and management) in a sustainable manner,&#13;
by efficiently removing road transport bottlenecks, lowering transport costs and improving the&#13;
maintenance of road network assets.&#13;
2.    The overall strategy identified between the Government of India (GOI) and the Bank for effective&#13;
project-based lending assistance to States in this context, is to strengthen and shift onto a sound&#13;
business management approach, the provision, management and maintenance of road&#13;
infrastructure, through:&#13;
- emphasis on overall network planning, with priority for the needs of high-traffic-&#13;
density routes/corridors;&#13;
- achievement of effective sustainable funding and management of road maintenance;&#13;
- introduction of international road construction methods, quality and management&#13;
standards;&#13;
- demonstration of the effectiveness of independent technical consultants and&#13;
contractors in project implementation, and of competition in the delivery of road&#13;
infrastructure services;&#13;
- implementation of sound high-return road infrastructure investments;&#13;
- comprehensive preparations for management of the environmental implications and&#13;
the social impacts of proposed road investments; and&#13;
- strengthening and modernization of State institutional arrangements, policies,&#13;
resources and capacities for the management of the sector.&#13;
Identification, Preparation and Implementation Requirements&#13;
3.    To be confident of achieving efficient, timely and sound project implementation, the preparation&#13;
of proposals for any Bank-assisted state-level road infrastructure investment projects in India will&#13;
normally need to comprise the following key elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(a) Strategic Options Study&#13;
The first substantive action, to be initiated by the individual State, will be a preliminary&#13;
network-wide Strategic Options Study (SOS), typically using road and traffic network data&#13;
already available to the State. This SOS is aimed at (i) providing an objective basis for and&#13;
strengthening the selection rationale for the likely roads investrnent priorities; (ii)&#13;
confirming the State's road funding history, and (iii) outlining the State's intended project&#13;
financing strategy. The SOS should include verified data on relevant State-wide population&#13;
size, composition and distribution; any protected 'cultural heritage' assets, and sensitive&#13;
environmental features which should all be taken into account in planning for the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
(b)  Feasibility Study(-ies)&#13;
Full economic and technical feasibility studies on the priority investments identified via the&#13;
Strategic Options Study. The feasibility studies will also include a state-wide social and&#13;
environmental screening, inclusive of the preparation and review of full strip maps of the&#13;
proposed road sections; maps of environmentally sensitive areas such as reserves, forests,&#13;
national parks, wetlands and/or sensitive habitats; and census-based population distribution&#13;
maps/data indicating relevant population intensities and locations of indigenous peoples'&#13;
groups near the project sites.&#13;
(c)  Preliminary Engineering and Environmental &amp; Social Impact Assessments&#13;
Preparation of preliminary engineering design standards for the full length of the proposed&#13;
road investments under the project, to be ready by Bank appraisal stage, as a basis for and&#13;
coordinated with preparation of an appropriate Environmental Assessment and preparations&#13;
for any necessary Social Impact (Resettlement &amp; Rehabilitation) action plans (see (d) and&#13;
(e) immediately below).&#13;
(d)  Environment Assessment&#13;
A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) will be required for all of the civil works&#13;
components of the project, in parallel with the project feasibility studies; followed by a full&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) wherever sensitive issues have been identified in the SEA,&#13;
prior to Bank appraisal. The preparation of the SEA and EA must be in full compliance&#13;
with the World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.01.&#13;
(e)  Social Impact / Resettlement &amp; Rehabilitation (R &amp; R)&#13;
The preparation of (i) a preliminary screening of likely Project Affected Persons (PAP) and&#13;
structures along the proposed project road sections; (ii) a full Baseline Socio-Economic-&#13;
Survey (BSES) for the identified impact areas of all proposed works, and (iii) a satisfactory&#13;
draft R&amp;R policy-based Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) which has been endorsed by the&#13;
State Government, will each be required as part of project preparations, as per the Bank's&#13;
OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement. In addition, if indigenous people ('tribals') are&#13;
likely to be sited within the impact areas, a full Indigenous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
(IPDP) will need to be prepared, in accordance with the Bank's OD 4.20 on Indigenous&#13;
Peoples.&#13;
In all projects, the principle of linking completion of resettlement with any order to proceed&#13;
with civil works shall apply. No physical work shall be undertaken on any stretch of road&#13;
before resettlement has been undertaken in accordance with a framework of entitlements,&#13;
which shall be agreed upon before appraisal. This framework shall describe categories of&#13;
losses, definitions of affected and entitled persons, their entitlements in the form of&#13;
compensation or other assistance, and the institutional framework for implementing a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). It shall also contain mechanisms for public participation&#13;
and local consultation, for monitoring and evaluation, and for coordination among the&#13;
project authorities and the various local jurisdictions involved in the road infrastructure&#13;
project. This framework must conform to OD 4.30 and shall apply for all components of&#13;
the project, also in cases where a phased approach is being used.&#13;
Based on this framework, a draft RAP shall be prepared before the project's appraisal. It&#13;
shall contain an estimate of likely affected persons as described below, as well as a budget&#13;
and a schedule of implementation, and other details as described in the applicable Tertns of&#13;
Reference (TOR). The draft RAP shall be finalized after detailed designs are completed&#13;
and exact impacts and numbers of affected persons are known, based on one or a&#13;
combination of two scenarios:&#13;
(i)    Where the alignment is known, a full census of all likely PAPs must be&#13;
included in the RAP. Detailed engineering designs must be available for&#13;
at least 25% of the project roads, and preliminary design must be&#13;
completed for the remaining 75% of the project roads, to identify PAPs&#13;
within the entire corridor of impact. Once designs are finalized, the&#13;
RAP shall be modified to incorporate any changes in impacts on PAPs,&#13;
or their numbers.&#13;
(ii)    Where the full alignment is not known before project appraisal, a phased&#13;
approach shall be used. Preliminary screening shall be undertaken&#13;
before determining the alignment, and likely social impacts and losses of&#13;
assets shall be weighed along with financial, technical, environmental&#13;
and other screening criteria. Once that has been done, the RAP must be&#13;
updated to incorporate the new information.&#13;
(f) Final Engineering for Project Appraisal Requirements&#13;
Preparation before the time of Bank project appraisal of a representative sample (in terms of&#13;
different types and settings) of at least 25% of the total length of proposed project road&#13;
investments to detailed engineering standard. At this stage, the planned civil works should&#13;
also be arranged into sufficiently large contract 'packages' to attract international as well as&#13;
domestic contractors with larger-scale high-quality road construction experience.&#13;
(g)  Institutional Strengthening&#13;
As an integral part of the overall project preparations, prior to Bank appraisal, this will&#13;
require the preparation of essential non-capital components aimed directly at sustainable&#13;
enhancements to the State's capacity for effective road infrastructure management and&#13;
financing, via (inter alia):&#13;
(i) action for early strengthening of the State's capacity to manage the proposed&#13;
project and ensure timely implementation through a review of procurement&#13;
decision-making procedures, provision of appropriate training and&#13;
upgraded resources, appropriate Technical Assistance (TA), and early&#13;
establishment of a dedicated agency unit (e.g., Project Management Unit) to&#13;
manage the proposed project.&#13;
(ii) preparation (or updating) of a State transport sector strategy, covering the&#13;
main physical, operational, financial and policy aspects of the major transport&#13;
modes over the next 5-10 years (subject to the quality of the available data and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
indicators), including a particular focus on the outlook for the road transport sub-&#13;
sector in this context and the realistic financing strategy(-ies) for both ongoing&#13;
road maintenance and road infrastructure investment priorities.&#13;
(iii) review of the State's future financial and organizational requirements for more&#13;
effective management of road infrastructure development and maintenance in a&#13;
transport-oriented context, resulting in the preparation of specific time-bound&#13;
action plans for regulatory/policy, organizational and financing improvements,&#13;
inclusive of:&#13;
-  indicators for improved road agency and sector performance;&#13;
-  State-level policy/regulatory measures to improve the efficiency of road&#13;
transport and of the management of road infrastructure;&#13;
-  measures for more effective facilitation of private sector investment and&#13;
participation in the provision and management of road infrastructure; and&#13;
-  specifications for an effective framework for consultation with public and&#13;
private sector 'stakeholder' representatives on road infrastructure plans and&#13;
priorities.&#13;
(iv) training and staff development action to re-orient and enhance the&#13;
institutional capabilities of the State agency(-ies) and key private sector&#13;
participants concerned with the provision and maintenance of road&#13;
infrastructure in the State; and&#13;
(v) comprehensive improvement of relevant budgeting, programming, financial and&#13;
contract management, project management and monitoring/reporting systems,&#13;
skills and practices, to ensure sustainability of the proposed project's benefits.&#13;
(h)  Project Implementation Supervision&#13;
The implementation of all civil works under the project, implemented once the project has&#13;
been approved by the Bank's Board, will require the services of independent Supervision&#13;
consultants engaged by the Borrower and appointed with full powers as the Engineer as per&#13;
FIDIC conditions.&#13;
Financing and Procurement Aspects of Project Preparation&#13;
4.     The initial production of an SOS which satisfactorily meets the aims and purposes described at&#13;
para. 3 (a) above, will be each individual State's responsibility. The costs of any consultancy services&#13;
engaged by the State for this purpose should normally also be met by the State concerned from its own&#13;
finances.&#13;
5.     For the action at stages (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above, the State should secure the services of&#13;
internationally-experienced Project Coordination Consultants (PCC) to manage and coordinate the&#13;
feasibility studies, other techno-economic, environmental and social preparations, preliminary and final&#13;
engineering of the proposed project, resulting in the preparation of a project package suitable for Bank&#13;
appraisal, as well as subsequently assisting the State with the project's implementation and supervision&#13;
stages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
6.     The costs of such PCC services for effective project preparation action up to the stage of Bank&#13;
appraisal will be substantial (typically in the range of US $1.5 -3.5 million, depending on project&#13;
size/complexity). The likely services for subsequent PCC services, beyond Bank appraisal, e.g. for stage&#13;
(h) above, cannot be confirmed until the outcome of preparations for Bank appraisal is known.&#13;
7.    The cost of the separate technical and professional services likely to be required for preparation of&#13;
assessments, policy measures, action plans, etc., for the Sector Institutional and Financing Reforms/&#13;
Strengthening component(s) outlined at stage (g) above, can only be separately determined once the&#13;
specific features of each State's sector circumstances and proposals are fully resolved.&#13;
8.     Procurement action for all civil works funded with Bank assistance under any resultant&#13;
investment project will be in strict accordance with World Bank International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
and/or National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. The procurement of both civil works and&#13;
consultants' services will use the India-specific version of the Bank's Standard Bid Documents as&#13;
promulgated by the Government of India (GOI), and where appropriate, the standard 'pre-qualification'&#13;
documentation also promulgated by GOI for all externally-assisted projects.&#13;

1.     Country and Sector Background&#13;
1. I At national and state levels, the transport scene in India is characterized by the growing importance of&#13;
road transport. The demand for intercity freight transport in India is expected to double every 12 years&#13;
while the demand for passenger transport is expected to double every 8-9 years. The share of total demand&#13;
going to roads in India is now about 60 percent of freight and 85 percent of passenger traffic, with the&#13;
railroads carrying the balance.&#13;
1.2 Since 1950, the core system of paved National roads and State roads (State Highways and state Major&#13;
District Roads) has expanded over seven-fold, from about 19,800 km to about 156,000 Iam, yet comprised&#13;
only 2% and 20% respectively of all roads in the 1990 national road inventory. In traffic terms, however,&#13;
the National network carries about 35 % of all road traffic while the State network carries about 60 %,&#13;
leaving 5 percent for the rural road network. The rapid expansion of the network, although achieving the&#13;
political and social objectives of national connectivity and rural access, was only made possible by&#13;
spreading resources over a great deal of single-lane (3.75 m wide) and intermnediate-lane (5.5 m)&#13;
carriageway roads with thin pavements. India's arterial road system is now highly congested and of poor&#13;
riding quality, causing high vehicle operating costs and low quality services for users.&#13;
1.3 A declining share for road investments in Plan funding allocations is in large part responsible for this&#13;
situation. However, at least equally serious for road programs are the absorptive capacity and&#13;
implementation constraints the sector agencies such the state Public Works Departments (PWDs). Sector&#13;
reforms are needed to foster introduction of high-quality engineering services and technologically&#13;
advanced road construction practices capable of delivering cost-effective, high-quality road infrastructure&#13;
on schedule, and to foster sound, systematic road network maintenance policies to maximize road asset life.&#13;
Some of India's states (led by Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan) have now, with national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
government support, endorsed such reforms in their context for implementation in conjunction with major&#13;
road upgrading proposals involving the Bank's assistance.&#13;
1.4 The State of Andhra Pradesh with a population of approximately 70 million and an area of 275,000&#13;
square km is both the fifth most populous and fifth largest State of the Union. The highway network of the&#13;
State consists of a total of 138,000 km of highways of which 2,950 km are classified as National Highways&#13;
(NH), 8,750 km as State Highways (SH), and 32,650 as Major District Roads (MDR). Even though the&#13;
SH/MDR network carries over 60% of the State's traffic, 53% of SH and nearly 90% of MDRs are still&#13;
single lane. Vehicle registrations have increased by approximately 16% per annum during the last five&#13;
years and traffic is projected to grow at least at 7-8% per annum for the foreseeable future. This indicates&#13;
that for many of the road links, congestion is already a serious problem.&#13;
2.     Project Objectives. The objectives of the project will be to: (a) promote a more rational and&#13;
efficient approach to road investment planning, management and maintenance at the state level; (b)&#13;
improve the GOAP's institutional capabilities in the sector; (c) improve longer-term resource mobilization&#13;
in the sector to ensure financial sustainability of the State's SH/MDR network; (d) upgrade the capabilities&#13;
of the private engineering and construction industry to meet growing demand for high quality highways,&#13;
engineering and construction services; and (e) improve the riding quality and capacity of selected&#13;
congested segments of the SH/MDR network to reduce vehicle operating costs, travel time, accidents and&#13;
pollution.&#13;
3.     Project Description. The proposed project would principally consist of: (a) civil works for&#13;
widening and rehabilitation of about 1100 km of state highways; (b) financing, during the project period,&#13;
of a declining share of road maintenance needs; (c) technical assistance for updating and expanding a&#13;
pavement management system for state roads; (d) technical assistance for reforming and institutional&#13;
strengthening of the State's road transport agencies and sustainable financing of road maintenance; and (e)&#13;
consulting services for project engineering design, monitoring and coordination of implementation, and for&#13;
supervision of civil works.&#13;
4.     Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost including contingencies and taxes is&#13;
estimated at approximately USS 350 million, which will finance the widening, strengthening and/or&#13;
rehabilitation of up to 1400 km of major roads, necessary consultancy and supervision services,&#13;
strengthened maintenance of Andhra Pradesh's major road network, and institutional strengthening&#13;
measures. The actual project amount is subject to further review at appraisal. The World Bank will&#13;
finance 70% of the estimated final total project cost with a IBRD loan of approximately US$ 254 million&#13;
and the Government of Andhra Pradesh will meet the 30% counterpart funding.&#13;
5.     Project Implementation. The proposed project would be implemented by the Government of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh through its Roads and Buildings Department (RBD), with the comprehensive assistance of&#13;
Project Coordinating Consultants (PCC) funded under the project.&#13;
6.     Lessons from Previous Operations. The project implementation record of the sector has been&#13;
mixed, with poor performance most often attributable to: (i) inadequate pre-qualification standards for&#13;
contractors; (ii) weak project implementation and management capacities for complex civil works&#13;
contracts; (iii) ineffectuality of contract performance provisions; (iv) shortage of competent mechanized&#13;
road construction contractors; (v) the Bank's logistical difficulties in supervising multi-state projects; (vi)&#13;
facilitation delays in land acquisition and clearance of obstructions from project roadways; (vii) poor&#13;
quality of project surveys and designs; and (viii) limited assimilation by borrowers of agreed Bank&#13;
procurement rules.&#13;
7.     Project Sustainability. This will be addressed at two complementary levels. The project works&#13;
being implemented with the PCC services will entail internationally-proven engineering standards and&#13;
practices. A progressive skills transfer program for RBD staff is to be provided, and various forms of&#13;
technical assistance will target the RBD's skills and systems needs to achieve more effective technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26-&#13;
operational management. The quality of the project road works should themselves ensure road&#13;
performance and durability considerably exceeding current norms. The longer-term sustainability of the&#13;
project benefits would be ensured through: (i) strengthened processes for improved road maintenance&#13;
planning and execution; (ii) the re-orientation of the RBD's roads functions increasingly involving private&#13;
sector project engineering, construction and supervision services; and (iii) associated institution building&#13;
measures to strengthen the organizational, policy and financial dimensions of road infrastructure&#13;
management in Andhra Pradesh.&#13;
8.     Poverty Category. This project is not directly aimed at poverty alleviation, although it will also&#13;
produce distributed benefits progressively in that context.&#13;
9.     Environmental and Social Impact. A sector-level Environment Assessment will be completed&#13;
before Bank appraisal of the project, with provision for more detailed assessment if necessary. Minimum&#13;
adverse environmental impacts are expected during construction operations and from the road works, as&#13;
the construction of any new roads is not envisaged. All project works will be limited to the strengthening,&#13;
widening and/or improvement of road pavements and shoulders within the existing right of way,&#13;
minimizing the need for land acquisition and the involuntary resettlement and rehabilitation (R&amp;R) of&#13;
people en route. Where R&amp;R aspects arise, this will be surveyed beforehand and comprehensively&#13;
addressed in accordance with the relevant Bank guidelines. Beneficial environmental impacts are expected&#13;
due to the improved engineering of roads leading to decreased traffic congestion, lower noise levels and&#13;
improved safety.&#13;
10.    Project Benefits &amp; Project Risks. The main direct benefits expected from this project will be&#13;
(i) greater efficiency in transport operations on the State's road network; (ii) more effective management&#13;
and maintenance of the major road network by Andhra Pradesh authorities; (iii) enhanced road planning,&#13;
financing, investment and implementation capacity in relevant State entities, and (iv) assimilation of&#13;
modem high-quality road engineering and construction methods and capabilities by the PWD and local&#13;
industry. The risks to the project relate directly to: (i) the State's ongoing commitment during project&#13;
preparation and implementation to Bank lending conditions and requirements; (ii) the effectiveness of the&#13;
state's financial planning to provide for counterpart funding obligations; (iii) the state's actions to&#13;
implement appropriate long-term funding levels as required for effective road network maintenance and&#13;
management; and (iv) inaction on the necessary institutional reforms and strengthening measures.&#13;

            The overall objective of the
            States' Road Infrastructure Development Technical
            Assistance Project is to strengthen policy based efforts by
            individual States towards effective reforms in the
            provision, financing and maintenance of road infrastructure,
            while assisting their preparation of high-priority quality
            road infrastructure investments aimed at Bank financing. The
            project will, over five years, finance technical assistance
            activities in three project components: a) project
            preparation and implementation support; b) policy support
            and institutional development; and c) project management.
