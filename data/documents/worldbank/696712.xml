TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex to the&#13;
Memorandum and Recommendation of the President&#13;
A. Project Description&#13;
1.    In addition to describing the project components, this section provides details of the reform&#13;
program as set out in GOSL's Sector Policy Letter and Action Plan and PERC's Operational Plan&#13;
(Attachments I and 2) and describes the institutional framework of the agencies being assisted. It also&#13;
elaborates on the project's institutional development and policy objectives and how they will be achieved.&#13;
Proiect Obiectives and Components&#13;
2.     The proposed project will:&#13;
(a)    assist SLTA in its transition to a more independent regulatory Commission and strengthen&#13;
its regulatory authority;&#13;
(b)    assist SLTA in (i) improving its administrative and technical capabilities to plan and&#13;
control the use of radio frequency spectrum, and (ii) establishing a computerized radio&#13;
frequency management and monitoring system; and&#13;
(c)    facilitate the divestiture of government owned enterprises, including SLT, by strengthening&#13;
the technical and administrative capacity of PERC.&#13;
3.    The project consists of two components:&#13;
(a)   technical assistance for the strengthening of SLTA, including (i) a frequency management&#13;
and monitoring system, with hardware, software, expert assistance during the initial years&#13;
of operation, and staff training; (ii) consulting services to assist SLTA in selected studies&#13;
on sector regulation; and (iii) staff training; and&#13;
(b)    assistance to PERC  in financing consultants and financial advisors for specific&#13;
transactions and strengthening of the PERC Secretariat (office equipment, training, travel,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
Relationship Between the Project and Other IDA SuDported TA Activities&#13;
4.     Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs) for the Second Telecommunications Project (Credit 2249-&#13;
CE)2 were used to assist in drafting the 1991 Telecommunications Act and establishing the regulatory&#13;
2 The December 22, 1995 supervision report for the Second Teleconmnunications Project ranked the project as&#13;
unsatisfactory regards implementation due to delays in the procurement of local networks. The original&#13;
development objectives, however, have largely been achieved satisfactoiily, despite the procurement problems&#13;
with local networks. The original project objective was a total of 50,000 lines (33,000 in Colombo and 17,000&#13;
outside). Due to lower unit prices than projected for switching equipment, it was agreed to contract about 44,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

framework. T'echnical assistance for SLTA was also provided through the recently closed Industrial&#13;
Development Project (IDP III, Credit 1948-CE)3, which helped SLTA build up its regulatory functions&#13;
after its creation in 1991.  The assistance to SLTA  under this project would support continued&#13;
strengthening of SLTA's regulatory capabilities by establishing an efficient frequency management and&#13;
monitoring system, and for its transition into a more independent regulatory Commission.&#13;
5.     IDA is supporting the recently established PERC, through the Public Manufacturing Enterprises&#13;
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2185-CE) of 1990 and IDF financing, in designing an overall privatization program&#13;
and strategy for various sectors (such as for airlines and utilities). Assistance is being provided through&#13;
experienced consultants and privatization professionals to help develop PERC's work program over the&#13;
short and medium term. With the help of such consultants, PERC has already drafted the terms of reference&#13;
for the Financial Advisor for the privatization of SLT.&#13;
Assistance for Institutional DeveloDment&#13;
6.      Technical Assistance to SLTA. Consultants will be retained, under procedures satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, to assist SLTA in studies of service pricing, network interconnection, quality and conditions of&#13;
service, type approval of equipment, technical standards and others (Attachment 3). The findings of this&#13;
study will be used to develop GOSL's longer term regulatory policies as well as to establish suitable license&#13;
conditions for a privatized SLT. Upon its conversion into a Comrnission, SLTA's management will pass&#13;
from one Director General to five Commissioners. This will involve a reorganization of SLTA, for which&#13;
assistance will be provided for under the proposed project, but detailed TOR will be prepared only when&#13;
the Commissioners and their background and experience are known. SLTA will also need assistance in&#13;
setting up and starting operations of the radio frequency monitoring system. Such assistance will be&#13;
included under the supply contract for the equipment for at least a year after installation to ensure proper&#13;
functioning.&#13;
7.     Training.   For SLTA's radio frequency monitoring system, training will be provided at the&#13;
suppliers' facilities and on-the-job during installation. Brief courses and seminars at local and foreign&#13;
training institutes would also be arranged for concemed staff and include: system management (2 weeks),&#13;
system operations (2 weeks), network operations and management (2 weeks), basic frequency management&#13;
(10 weeks), monitoring and inspection (5 weeks), mobile monitoring operations (2 weeks) and equipment&#13;
calibration (10 weeks). Courses will be in Sri Lanka or abroad, depending on the number of participants&#13;
and the availability of suitable standard courses.&#13;
8.     Technical Assistance to PERC. Two groups of consultants will be retained. The first group will&#13;
be composed of mainly intemational specialists and consulting firms recruited on a short-term basis to&#13;
advise on specific transactions. Their main tasks will be to (a) carry out the necessary studies for policy&#13;
and strategy formulation, pre-reform packaging and implementation of privatization transactions; (b) assess&#13;
lines for Colombo and 32,000 for the regions. Even discounting the regional lines, the shortfall is, therefore, only&#13;
about 6,000 lines compared to the original objective. This shortfall should be seen against, inter alia, the 50,000&#13;
private mobile cellular lines and the 50,000 SLT Colombo "emergency scheme" lines, which were a consequence&#13;
of the sector liberalization and legal, regulatory and institutional reforms implemented as conditions of project&#13;
processing.&#13;
3 The radio frequency monitoring equipment provided under the Industrial Development Project III is fully&#13;
compatible with the equipment to be provided under the proposed project and will form part of a fully integrated&#13;
radio frequency monitoring system. Without the assistance already provided under IDP III, the proposed project&#13;
would have been about US$2.0 million more costly.&#13;

the past and present situation of the enterprises and identify key issues to be resolved to facilitate&#13;
restructuring and privatization; (c) review the existing regulatory framework, examine all regulatory issues,&#13;
and recommend changes, as necessary, to implement a successful restructuring and privatization program;&#13;
and (d) assist PERC in preparing memoranda, terms of reference and bidding documents as well as in the&#13;
transactions and all tasks leading to the sales closure. Local consultants and specialized staff (e.g. lawyers,&#13;
financial analysts and technical experts) will be hired on a long-term basis as the core staff to plan and&#13;
coordinate GOSL's privatization program. Local technical experts will act as counterparts to intemational&#13;
consultants in specific transactions, while others will provide PERC with continuous advisory services&#13;
based on their specialization. In addition, for specific large transactions (e.g., telecommunications)&#13;
reputable investment banks will be hired to undertake the assignment.&#13;
9.     PERC's planned privatization transactions and the estimated cost of transactions to be funded by&#13;
IDA under this project component are given in Attachment 2 and summarized below:&#13;
1. Colombo Gas Co.               Completed          July 1995       November 1995 (Actual)&#13;

10.    Training of PERC staff involved in privatization transactions will be provided on general issues by&#13;
IDA's technical assistance team members and consultants recruited for the project. Other training will be&#13;
on an ad-hoc basis through brief courses and seminars as the need arises. Furthermore, study tours for&#13;
professional staff will be arranged for visits to foreign countries with relevant experience in the&#13;
privatization of public enterprises.&#13;
Assistance for Radio Spectrum Regulation&#13;
11.    Current Situation. SLTA currently operates three fixed monitoring sites and a mobile monitoring&#13;
vehicle. A frequency management database, using dBase and containing primarily a frequency list exists,&#13;
4 B3ased on IDA funding of one large transaction (like SLT, Air Lanka, etc.) and three medium sized transactions&#13;
(Lanka E:lectric Co., Plantations, Manufacturing Units, etc.). The transactions for which IDA funds will be used&#13;
have not yet been identified, as the exact order of privatizations will depend on market and political considerations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
but has not been updated, and the necessary software documentation is missing. Furthermore, this software&#13;
is not based on modem standards, is difficult to use and not very reliable. An existing server and local area&#13;
network (LAN) are not being used. A 1:25,000 series of topographic maps are available on which a&#13;
digitized terrain elevation model (DEM) can be established.&#13;
12.   Proposed Frequency Management and Monitoring System (FMMS). This project component&#13;
will integrate existing equipment with the proposed frequency management and monitoring system. The&#13;
project will provide SLTA with the licensing and monitoring tools to adjust its fees for the use of radio&#13;
frequencies towards their economic value, thereby increasing the fiscal benefits as well as ensuring the&#13;
efficient allocation of a scarce resource. Rapid processing of telecommunications licenses and strict&#13;
enforcement of license conditions for the use of the radio frequency spectrum is also essential for the&#13;
orderly development of domestic telecommunications facilities and increased private sector participation in&#13;
the provision of services. The FMMS will be an integrated hardware and software system consisting of the&#13;
following eleven subsystems:&#13;
(1)    headquarters computer systems and nationwide networking&#13;
(2)    a frequency management database&#13;
(3)    frequency management application modules&#13;
(4)    a digitized terrain elevation subsystem&#13;
(5)    a Geographic Information System (GIS)&#13;
(6)    VHF/UHF monitoring equipment and stations&#13;
(7)    HF/MF monitoring equipment and stations&#13;
(8)    monitoring software&#13;
(9)    mobile measurement vehicle equipment&#13;
(10)   a satellite monitoring station and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) hub site, and&#13;
(I 1)   VSAT network&#13;
13.   The proposed frequency management system will use a server for about 14 client computers at its&#13;
headquarters facility in Colombo. The frequency management database will contain all necessary tables to&#13;
support the licensing of telecommunications services, licenses of operators (including amateur radio&#13;
operators), licenses of radio communications equipment vendors, type acceptance of radio communications&#13;
equipment, inspection services, monitoring services, the tracking of legal cases, and the accounting related&#13;
to fees for all licenses and permits as well as the necessary data for timely billing and collection of license&#13;
fees. The monitoring software will reside on client computers in the monitoring stations and will interface&#13;
with the central database over a wide area network.&#13;
14.    Two broad categories of software will be used for the frequency management; the first used for&#13;
licensing, and the second for management of interference. The principal area where automated licensing is&#13;
needed is the VHF/UHF spectrum, due to the high demand for fixed and land mobile network services. The&#13;
electromagnetic compatibility analysis software will consist of programs for the various services,&#13;
interference conditions and planning possibilities (broadcast station-station interference, inter-cell&#13;
interference, terrain profile, cellular frequency assignment, microwave frequency planning, HF links,&#13;
satellite service area coverage, etc.)&#13;
15.    To improve the efficiency in analyzing communications facilities in the VHF/UHF bands, digitized&#13;
terrain elevation models will be maintained in database tables. The project will provide the necessary&#13;
hardware (scanner, plotter, etc.) and software (for scanning and gridding, database interface, and GIS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
16.     VHF/UHF  monitoring  stations will be installed  in Anuradhapura, Colombo, Galle, Kandy,&#13;
Negombo, and Nuwaraeliya. The HF/MF direction finding sites will be located in Anuradhapura, Kandy,&#13;
Negombo, and Galle. Equipment for two additional mobile units will also be provided. A central satellite&#13;
earth station will perform the dual function of satellite monitoring and serving as the hub site for dedicated&#13;
communications between the central headquarters facilities and five VSATs located at the monitoring&#13;
stations. A wide area networking software will allow remote control of monitoring sites by operators at the&#13;
headquarters facilities.&#13;
Project Cost and Financial Plan&#13;
17.     The total project cost is estimated at US$21.6 million, with a foreign cost component of US$12.6&#13;
million. Detailed costs for SLTA's frequency management and monitoring system have been estimated in&#13;
US dollars by consultants, based on mid-1995 price levels. Physical contingencies are estimated at about&#13;
5% for civil works and other items. No price escalation has been considered for imported equipment due to&#13;
the recent price stability/reductions experienced for this kind of equipment. Detailed project cost estimates&#13;
and yearly expenditures are given in Attachment 4 and summarized in Table 1. 1.&#13;

3 GOSL/SLTA will contribute existing sites and buildings. Antennas will be installed on existing SLT towers and on rooftops&#13;
of existing buildings. Civil works and power supply mainly consist of adaptation of existing properties to the requirements of&#13;
the frequency management system and are of a minor nature.&#13;

18.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 15 million would finance about 69% of the total project cost and&#13;
100% of the foreign exchange costs. The remaining cost of US$6.6 million (including US$3.3 million&#13;
equivalent for taxes and duties on imported equipment) would be covered by SLTA/GOSL. The design&#13;
and specification of the FMMS for SLTA has been financed by a Japanese Trust Fund. The financing plan&#13;
for the project is given in table below:&#13;

Project Timetable&#13;
19.   The project is expected to be completed in about 3.5 years after Board Approval. SLTA's FMMS&#13;
would be tendered by July 1996, and the necessary arrangements for technical assistance and consultancy&#13;
proposals would be finalized by mid 1996. Transactions presently scheduled by PERC would proceed&#13;
according to the operational plan as agreed during negotiations (Attachment 2). A Project Implementation&#13;
Plan and timetable for the main project activities is in Attachment 5. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 1999.&#13;
B. Project Administration and Implementation&#13;
20.    SLTA  and PERC will be responsible for the implementation of their respective project&#13;
components. A core of professionals within each agency, coordinated by a Project Manager, will be&#13;
assigned to manage the implementation of the project (including procurement of goods and services,&#13;
implementation monitoring, accounts, audits, and reporting), to work as consultants' counterparts, and to&#13;
assist in staff training.&#13;
Procurement of Goods and Services&#13;
21.    Project TA and training will be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Consultants will be hired in accordance with IDA's guidelines for the use of consultants. The frequency&#13;
management and monitoring system will be procured under IDA's ICB procedures in a single package,&#13;
including detailed design, system integration, hardware, software, staff training, and assistance for the&#13;
initial operation of the system. This will encourage bidders' interest and provide single responsibility for&#13;
the proper functioning of the system. Procurement of goods costing over US$200,000 will require IDA's&#13;
prior review. All other contracts will be subject to random post reviews by visiting supervision missions.&#13;
Contracts for hiring consulting firms costing US$100,000 equivalent or more and contracts for hiring&#13;
individuals costing US$50,000 equivalent or more will be subject to prior review by IDA. More than 90%&#13;
of the value of IDA's credit would require prior review. Office equipment (upto US$70,000) will be&#13;
procured through National Competitive Bidding. Table 1.3 below indicates the proposed bid packages,&#13;
procurement methods, and estimated amounts.&#13;

2 GOSL/SLTA will contribute existing sites and buildings. Antennas will be installed on existing SLT towers and on rooftops&#13;
of existing buildings. Civil works and power supply mainly consist of adaptation of existing properties to the requirements of&#13;
the frequency management system and are of a minor nature.&#13;
C onsists of consultancies for telecom tariffs and other regulatory studies (US$0.8 million) and financial advisors and other&#13;
assistance for one major and three minor privatization transactions (US$4.6 million). Potential privatization transactions are&#13;
listed in Attachments 2 and 7, e.g. SLT, Air Lanka (major) and Orient Lanka, Lanka Electric Co. and plantations (minor).&#13;
4~ Taxes and duties on imported equipment (US$3.3 million) have been excluded.&#13;
Disbursement Arran2ements&#13;
22.    The IDA  credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100%  of foreign expenditures for imported&#13;
equipment and materials, or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally procured goods, or 70% of other locally&#13;
procured goods, and (b) 100% of expenditures for consultancy services and training. The projected&#13;
disbursement schedule is given in Attachment 6. A summary of projected disbursement is shown in Table&#13;
1.4. Advanced preparation of procurement documents should facilitate early implementation and&#13;
disbursement. The main procurement consists of one turn-key package and the projected disbursement&#13;
period is, therefore, about three years shorter than the standard profile. Full documentation would be&#13;
required for all equipment contract above US$200,000, consultant firm contracts above US$100,000, and&#13;
individual consultant contracts above US$50,000. Disbursements for contracts below this amounts and all&#13;
training expenditures would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting&#13;
documentation for SOEs would be retained by SLTA and PERC and made available for review by IDA&#13;

Accounts and Audits&#13;
23.   To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be established at a bank under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. This will be maintained in US dollars with an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$500,000 and would be used to cover IDA's share of eligible project expenditures of less that&#13;
US$100,000 under all disbursement categories. The authorized allocation shall initially be limited to&#13;
US$300,000 until disbursements and outstanding commitments against the Credit equal or exceed SDR3.0&#13;
million (US$4.3 million). Applications for replenishment of the account, supported by appropriate&#13;
documentation, would be submitted regularly (preferably monthly, but not less that quarterly) or when the&#13;
amounts withdrawn equal 50% of the initial deposit.&#13;
24.   The Ministry of Finance and Planning will have the overall responsibility for the project accounts.&#13;
The audit of project accounts as well as of SLTA and PERC will be conducted by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. SLTA and PERC will maintain their accounting systems in accordance with sound&#13;
international principles and practices acceptable to IDA. Each entity will provide interim and annual&#13;
financial statements to reflect its financial performance and position. Audited financial statements for&#13;
SLTA and PERC and audit reports on the project accounts, including the Special Accounts, and separate&#13;
opinions on any SOE, will be provided to IDA within six months of the closing of the fiscal year. The&#13;
audit report will include a statement of the adequacy of the accounting procedures, intemal controls, and&#13;
compliance with covenants. The accounting and financial reporting should provide adequate and timely&#13;
information to IDA for project supervision.&#13;
Monitoring, Renortine and Supervision&#13;
25.   The timely implementation of the various steps set out in the action plan of the Policy Letter will be&#13;
monitored and constitutes a major indicator of the reform progress. IDA will also monitor the overall&#13;
performance of SLTA and PERC during project implementation aided by performance indicators&#13;
(Attachment 7). Further, as part of its supervision activities, IDA will monitor procurement and project&#13;
implementation. This monitoring should assist GOSL and IDA in taking timely corrective action.&#13;
26.    SLTA and PERC will submit quarterly progress reports in a format acceptable to IDA within one&#13;
month of the end of each quarter. Project accounts will be maintained by each agency, so that the costs of&#13;
each project component and credit disbursement can be clearly established. The format of the quarterly&#13;
project progress report was discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
27.    Supervision of the project will focus on the following key aspects: (a) conversion and development&#13;
of SLTA into a more independent regulatory Commission in accordance with the agreed timetable; (b)&#13;
timely and effective procurement of goods and services; (c) implementation of the privatization transactions&#13;
agreed with PERC; and (d) effective coordination by each agency of the various project components. A&#13;
mid-term review is planned for June 1997 of all project activities and would be conducted jointly by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Planning, SLTA, PERC, and IDA. Upon project completion, an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared. The total estimated IDA input for supervision is 40 staff-&#13;
weeks.&#13;

The World Bank&#13;
Thro' The Secretary&#13;
Ministry of Finance, Colombo.&#13;
Dear Mr. Wood,&#13;
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR POLICY&#13;
In 1995, the Government of Sri Lanka defined its policy&#13;
for further development of the telecommunications sector. The&#13;
purpose  of this letter is to provide  some details and a time&#13;
frame for the implementation of this policy.&#13;
02.               The  Government's  broad  objectives  in  the&#13;
telecommunications sector are to:&#13;
(i)  expand and improve the telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure to better support economic,&#13;
social and cultural development in Sri Lanka;&#13;
(ii) to facilitate new investment and competition in&#13;
the sector by strengthening the enabling legal and&#13;
regulatory framework; and&#13;
(iii) encourage increased private sector participation in&#13;
telecommunications development, including the&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
03.    To achieve these objectives, the Government will undertake&#13;
a sector restructuring programme which will involve the following&#13;
main activities:&#13;
(a) amendment of.the Tfelecommunications Act;&#13;
(b)  promoting competition and private participation&#13;
in the  provision of telecommunications services:&#13;
(c)  restructuring the operations of SLT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Attachment I&#13;
page 2of 4&#13;
Amendments of the Telecommunications Act:&#13;
4.           The Telecommunications Act was passed by Parliament in&#13;
1991. During the past four years the 1991 Act has been effective,&#13;
it has become evident that the duties placed on the regulator&#13;
(Director-General) are so varied that a broader based regulatory&#13;
structure would be desirable. Further, the departmental status of&#13;
the Authority limits its operational and administrative autonomy&#13;
(including salary structure) and is a major constraint on its&#13;
ability to discharge its duties efficiently.&#13;
5.          A strong and independent  telecommunications  sector&#13;
regulator is needed to ensure fair interconnection and revenue&#13;
sharing arrangements between the increasing number of service&#13;
providers.   Further, as more services are being provided by the&#13;
private sector and Government plans to restructure SLT, it is&#13;
becoming increasingly important that the consumer protection&#13;
aspects of the Telecommunications Act are efficiently implemented.&#13;
6.    An amendment to Act was therefore drafted with the objective&#13;
to convert the "Sri Lanka Telecommunications Authority" (SLTA)&#13;
into a "Commission" which would consist of five "Commissioners"who&#13;
have excelled in the  field of engineering,  accountancy,  law,&#13;
economics,   public   administration   business   and   commercial&#13;
management.   The Commission's   activities   would be financed&#13;
through licences and other operator fees rather than through&#13;
GOSL's budget and provide it with appropriate financial autonomy.&#13;
On 01st February, 1996 the Cabinet decided to amend the 1991&#13;
Telecommunications Act accordingly.&#13;
Promoting Competition and Private provision of Services.&#13;
7.         The  Government  and  the  regulatory  body    for  the&#13;
Telecommunications sector will promote competition by adopting&#13;
transparent procedures for licensing of operators, facilitating&#13;
interconnection, promoting economically sound cost-based pricing&#13;
principles, and providing adequate regulatory certainty to&#13;
invertors.   Competition will be allowed in the   provision of&#13;
telecommunications services (other than basic wired voice&#13;
telephony). Operators will be allowed to provide telecommunications&#13;
services using technology of their choice, provided the equipment&#13;
has been "type" approved and an appropriate operating licence has&#13;
been obtained. The number of competitors and the duration of their&#13;
license has been obtained.   The number of competitors and the&#13;
duration of their licenses will be determined based on market and&#13;
economic efficiency considerations.   Transparent and expeditious&#13;
procedures for licensing will be used to promote the entry of&#13;
competing service providers.   In particular,  two licensees for&#13;
radio based basic services are expected to be issued by March,&#13;
1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Attachment 1&#13;
Re-Structuring of SLT                                    Page3of4&#13;
8.       It is the Government's objective to transform Sri Lanka&#13;
Telecom (SLT) into a commercially operatedL and fully autonomous&#13;
entity.   A new corporate entity is to be incorporated under he&#13;
Companies Act. to which SLT's assets and liabilities will be&#13;
transferred as well as its existing telephone operations.&#13;
Within the next two years, SLT's administration and operation, is&#13;
expected to have been restructured with additional changes to be&#13;
undertaken from time to time as market conditions permit.&#13;
9.      To ensure SLT's long-term financial viability, facilitate&#13;
competition   and create a level paying  field for all  sector&#13;
operators, the Government will make all efforts to ensure that&#13;
SLT's prices to end users and its interconnection charges to other&#13;
service providers are based on financial costs. S.L.T's existing&#13;
tariffs would therefore have to be rebalanced, based on a tariff&#13;
study combined with realistic demand forecasts.  Once adequately&#13;
balanced S.L.T's tariffs will be regulated by a price cap system&#13;
which will be enforced by the regulator.&#13;
10.          The  Government  intends  to  implement  this  sector&#13;
restructuring programme as per the attached action plan and keep&#13;
the Bank informed regularly on the progress of implementation.&#13;
Yours sincerely,&#13;

TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT&#13;
Sector Reform Program Study&#13;
1.     To assist GOSL in its long term policy formulation and sector refoim initiatives, including&#13;
the privatization of SLT and competition, a study will be undertaken by SLTA covering: (i) tariff&#13;
structure and levels; (ii) demand for connections and traffic; (iii) quality of service standards; (iv)&#13;
expansion into rural and less profitable areas; (v) market structure and (vi) interconnection and&#13;
revenue sharing arrangements. Of special interest would be an analysis of the inter-relationship&#13;
between those areas, e.g., the impact of telecommunications tariffs on demand and market&#13;
structure, including SLT's privatization. A brief description of each area follows below:&#13;
(a)    Tariffs. SLT's local tariffs are amongst the lowest in the world. The tariffs referred to are&#13;
connection fees, local call charges and monthly subscription fees. The long-distance tariffs are&#13;
relatively high, especially the domestic ones. This may have encouraged uneconomic demand for&#13;
connection of subscribers that make few long-distance calls, e.g. residential subscribers. Other&#13;
effects of this tariff structure include: relatively low revenues per annum, declining profitability of&#13;
SLT, reduced demand for other communications means, e.g. pagers, call offices, cellular facilities&#13;
etc. and costly SLT investments to catch up with demand for telephone lines that may not be&#13;
profitable.&#13;
(b)    Demand. The most recent demand study is from 1991. Since then, SLT's network has&#13;
expanded, private telecommunications operators have established themselves in the market and new&#13;
services have been introduced. A new demand study should, therefore, be undertaken. An important&#13;
element of such a study should be to estimate the residential groups ability and willingness to pay&#13;
increased tariffs, point elasticities for a basket of charges/services (monthly, local, long-distance,&#13;
and international charges) , and the impact of tariff changes on the future demand for service.&#13;
(c)    Quality of Service. SLT's service quality is inadequate and realistic annual targets for its&#13;
improvement should be established. If it is decided to rebalance SLT's local tariffs, i.e. increasing&#13;
the monthly rental and/or connection fee, this may be made more acceptable to the subscribers by&#13;
improving SLT's service quality (and billing), e.g. the increase in certain tariffs could be coupled to&#13;
the achievement of service quality standards specified in the operating license for a future private&#13;
operator.&#13;
(d)    Rural Areas. Suitable targets, license conditions and incentives should be built into the&#13;
operating license of SLT, and cellular, pay phones and other operators to expand into rural and&#13;
less profitable areas. Tariff structure, interconnection, revenue sharing and other arrangements&#13;
should be studied with a view to identify such incentives.&#13;
(e)    Market Structure. Low SLT tariffs may reduce the demand for other services which are&#13;
priced commercially, i.e. based on the cost of providing the service and market competition.&#13;
Example of such services are: paging, pay phones, cellular and data transmission. Further, the&#13;
price offered for SLT at its privatization by potential strategic investors is likely to be relatively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;

low if tariffi are not rebalanced. After an eventual exclusivity period for basic services, SLT's&#13;
profitable business subscriber (who generate most of long-distance calls) could be taken over by&#13;
competitors, leaving SLT with the residential subscribers (that generate few long-distance calls)&#13;
and a consequent fall in SLT's profitability.&#13;
(f)   Interconnection and Revenue Sharing Arrangements. Given the increasing number of&#13;
competitive telecommunications operators in the sector, interconnection and revenue sharing&#13;
arrangements have become important issues. The current arrangements will be evaluated to ensure&#13;
these arrangements between the various operators, including SLT, are equitable.&#13;
2.    The data collection and initial analysis of each area of the study will be contracted with&#13;
suitably qualified local consultancy firms when available. The detailed analysis and study - le&#13;
inter-relation between the various elements (e.g. the impact of various tariff structures and -vels&#13;
on demand, competition and SLT's value) should be carried out by a well qualified consulting firm&#13;
with international experience and ability to be the responsible party for the study as a whole.&#13;
3.    This study will build on relevant available information and the research of other studies&#13;
already completed, e.g.:&#13;
e the Telecommunications Act of 1991;&#13;
* the World Bank Telecommunications Sector Report of 1994;&#13;
*   relevant parts of the Technical Annex for the proposed "Telecommunications Regulation and&#13;
Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Project", and&#13;
* other relevant information available with MOPT, SLTA, SLT, and IDA.&#13;
4.    The study will be initiated in mid-1996 and an interim report will be ready by end-1996.&#13;
The report will be finalized by early 1997.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Telecommunications
            Regulation and Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance
            Project are to: 1) assist the Sri Lanka Telecommunications
            Authority (SLTA) in its transition to a more independent
            regulatory Commission and strengthen its regulatory
            authority; 2) assist SLTA in: (a) improving its
            administrative and technical capabilities to plan and
            control the use of radio frequency spectrum; and (b)
            establishing a computerized radio frequency management and
            monitoring system; and 3) facilitate the divestiture of
            government owned enterprises, including Sri Lanka Telecom
            (SLT), by strengthening the technical and administrative
            capacity of the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC).
            The project consists of two components: 1) technical
            assistance for the strengthening of SLTA, including: (a) a
            frequency management and monitoring system, with hardware,
            software, expert assistance during the initial years of
            operation, and staff training; (b) consulting services to
            assist SLTA in selected studies on sector regulation; and
            (c) staff training; and 2) assistance to PERC in financing
            consultants and financial advisors for specific transactions
            and strengthening of the PERC Secretariat (office equipment,
            training, travel, etc.).
