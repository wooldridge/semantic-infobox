USA (the "World Bank Grou &gt;")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad international recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Interi E!ti nal&#13;
Organizations (lOs), the G77 and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin ir the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed to :F ind&#13;
access to basic services anc raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic c n: vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on  i ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coor:1 n ed&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize piivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robust pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects anc h is&#13;
understood to be the greatest barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm r 1:.&#13;
(D) Governments, development f nance institutions, donors, and private investors share an int :, et in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand :ii: in&#13;
the numbers of structurally scund and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual emE , Iice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a ecognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of pri ate&#13;
investors that actively partici )ate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will ter efit&#13;
from collective action betwe(n this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowli cig to&#13;
find solutions to complex ir frastructure financing challenges that no single institutior c: uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, the Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure 1 a: lity&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"). The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leverac ir g the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of ir stitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructt r! /ith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prep ilar Zn,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigatic n for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard, Ii :! 31F&#13;
aims to complement existing and proposed services and initiatives currently supported ty the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepa ,( all-&#13;
structured, infrastructure pro ects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for accesE rg the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and )ther GIF partners, in combination with guidance from proE c:, ive&#13;
private sector financiers into Iroject structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater IE v ige&#13;
of official resources in the fai.e of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular for I ge&#13;
and complex projects with the potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now interes-ed in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure 1=a: lity&#13;
Partnership Program, together with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have comt? to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended t) be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set o it ir&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collatc ri: ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative natui e and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and v il&#13;
other potential partners until tie GIF is formally established. The final version of these objE:: . V !s&#13;
and principles will be agreed ipon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fu ther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing tI IE IF,&#13;
with a view to formally establi;hing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foreg )ing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue tc&#13;
collaborate in developing the 31F, including but not limited to:&#13;

sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through th  u&#13;
of knowledge platfornis for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finaliz ng the design of the GIF, the multilateral development bank  i :ed&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited to participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF de sic is&#13;
finalized, additional collabor)tive efforts are required to develop the operational details f:r he&#13;
GIF, at all times complemE nting existing efforts and facilities and building upon the s 1. 'ed&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the 3i of&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the ClF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure p1 De ts&#13;
in emerging markets and dev floping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparati Ii,&#13;
provision of appropriate risk rlitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercia r&#13;
institutional investor engagerr ent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex publ c-private partnerships and projects with potential for commer::i:&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastru :t1.&#13;
financing solutions that no sirgle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF   ims to create a global platform to provide financial and coorc ra on&#13;
resources in collaboration wit i the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of th :v le&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDI&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemer t c ild&#13;
stretch from upstream suppor: on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to down 3tream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemen:.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structure&#13;
infrastructure projects, the GI can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset cla, s attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long :!r i&#13;
assets in faster growing econ &gt;mies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profile:,.&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to oF erate according to the following core principles, to be finalize :u on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities th) ill&#13;
draw together comparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing pub ic goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure pro ects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting susti inability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to b!;t&#13;
practice standard 3 for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, c )mplementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing te:h ir Ial&#13;
and financial resc urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mul I 3ti ral&#13;
development inst tutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and flexible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greate&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the resources of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements ind Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t e&#13;
development and implementation of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF pa ti s&#13;
are expected to fall into one c more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wi :,&#13;
considered Funding Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partn.,rs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice ind support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-fLinde:I&#13;
activities and/or r rovision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc 1&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne rs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/(r institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as wE la!&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure pro ects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparal cni&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inves:ment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Council is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin. ,&#13;
management and use of fund 3, and development of operational policies and procedures; a 1:1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Urit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, wit[ advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compoE it c of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propc sw1 to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counci comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing DirE .c&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer of the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilit e&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve i.&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wil i&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of )rojects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admir istered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicatec t :, n&#13;
established for this purpose (te GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fu i ti( n&#13;
as a coordinating body as pro ects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mov:.&#13;
toward technical support and -inancing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead inc \ki ial&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemertation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partnei&#13;
institutions, coordinated by th- GIF Management Unit in consultation with client goverrimer t;,&#13;
according to specific project r,quirements and the project origination processes. Composi it r )f&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gover in: its.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follow r g&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Impact-projects that support the development goals of the GIl&#13;
partner institution 3;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-proj )cts that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities ir c&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-prcjects that require multiple parties to come together to providE&#13;
structuring, arran jing and financial support, and/or projects which require a bl r d )f&#13;
financial instrumEnts; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impac -projects that have significant potential to achieve finarcial t a ility,&#13;
leverage public fi inds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s I&#13;
as through Publi -Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's sei vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastricture investments that have global public good characteristics :ch&#13;
as climate friendly-project. that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior cf&#13;
infrastructure services; and ti ade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne :tv y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of support provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with a  w&#13;
to complementing the resources and support already available from partner entities ard ot -ir&#13;
funding mechanisms. During :he GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac:i- i as,&#13;
corresponding to major project development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr :!r ig;&#13;
and legal, regula*ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparation and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PFP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction support and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, and design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangiig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financil,&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies-i icluding in particular the management of environmental and :oc il&#13;
impacts and risks, and transparency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastri c iI e&#13;
projects in supporting sustain able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, -eputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements 1:v&#13;
external implementing entitie,. under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an ap3roach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards anc c tl  r&#13;
standards and policies, and develop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GI&#13;
Technical Partners who are eKpected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
