            The drivers of the information revolution :
            cost, computing power, and convergence
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The author explains the drivers of the
            information revolution - the decline in the cost of
            transmitting information, the increase in the power of
            computing, and the shift from analog to digital information
            technologies that has joined the telecommunications and
            computing industries and merged segments of the information
            industry. Over the past twenty years, the cost of voice
            transmission circuits and the computing power per dollar
            invested have both fallen by a factor of 10,000. Prices have
            not fallen nearly as fast - they have been set by a
            cartel-like system of international agreements between
            incumbent monopolies. But as convergence restructures the
            telecommunications industry, new operators are arbitraging
            the difference between costs and the old tariff structures,
            putting pressure on incumbent telecommunications operators.
