                                          PREFACE&#13;
The Philippine Economic Update (PEU) provides an update on key economic and social&#13;
developments, as well as policies over the past six months. It also presents findings from recent&#13;
World Bank studies on the Philippines. It places them in a longer term and global context, and&#13;
assesses the implications of these developments and policies on the outlook for the Philippines.&#13;
Its coverage ranges from the macroeconomy and financial markets to indicators of human&#13;
welfare and development. It is intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business&#13;
leaders, financial market participants, and the community of analysts and professionals&#13;
engaged on the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;

                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
The Philippines is among the strongest performers in the region, bucking the trend. In the first&#13;
half (H1) of 2015, among the major economies in the region, the only countries to accelerate&#13;
their quarterly growth rates were the Philippines, from 5 to 5.6 percent, and Vietnam. In spite&#13;
of this acceleration, for the two quarters combined, Philippine growth rate came out at 5.3&#13;
percentâ&#128;&#148;its lowest half year growth rate since 2011. On the demand side, the strong&#13;
performance of private domestic demand at 8.1 percent, supported by record low inflation and&#13;
robust remittances, drove GDP growth. However, the slow pace of public spending and the&#13;
contraction in net exports pulled down GDP growth. On the supply side, the onset of El NiÃ±o led&#13;
to stagnant agriculture growth. Meanwhile, growth in industry and services was respectable,&#13;
with both sectors growing by around 5.8 percent. In Q3, available high frequency data suggest&#13;
an improving economy, in particular, an acceleration in government spending.&#13;
&#13;
Continued job gains in the services and industry sectors could not compensate for the&#13;
substantial job losses in agriculture caused by El NiÃ±o.1 Based on the latest round of the Labor&#13;
Force Survey (LFS) in July 2015, job generation continued to be led by the services sector,&#13;
majority of which belonged to the informal services sector, followed by industry. In industry,&#13;
the construction sector, not manufacturing, drove job creation. However, job generation in&#13;
both sectors were not enough to offset the substantial job losses in the agriculture sector,&#13;
which lost some 877,000 jobs as agricultural production fell as a consequence of El NiÃ±o. In all,&#13;
the country experienced a net loss of around 96,000 jobs between July 2014 and July 2015.2&#13;
&#13;
In recent years, strong economic growth and effective government programs are improving&#13;
poverty reduction, but, in 2014, natural disasters and delays in state-managed rice&#13;
importation harmed the poor. Between 2012 and 2013, poverty fell by three percentage points&#13;
(ppt), as underemployment among the poor fell significantly and domestic cash transfers to the&#13;
bottom income quintile grew substantially. This suggests that the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s conditional&#13;
cash transfer (CCT) program is well-targeted and reaching the poor. However, in the first half of&#13;
2014, the latest Annual Poverty Indicators Survey3 suggests that poverty increased. The&#13;
increase is attributed to Typhoon Yolanda (a one time, unprecedented event) and high rice&#13;
prices (due to rice importation delays by the state monopoly). Nevertheless, poverty fell by&#13;
around two ppt from 2012 to 2014.&#13;

round of the Labor Force Survey (LFS) included the province of Leyte while all 2014 LFS rounds excluded Leyte due&#13;
to survey constraints caused by Typhoon Yolanda.&#13;

  To produce comparable annual estimates of poverty, the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) income&#13;
module was adopted in the APIS starting 2013. The APIS is conducted during non-FIES years, but is only a first-&#13;
semester estimate.&#13;

&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Like the rest of the region, the domestic financial market experienced large volatilities in&#13;
  recent months, but underlying fundamentals remain sound. After reaching a record high early&#13;
  in the year, the equity market experienced a sharp decline. By late August, year-to-date gains&#13;
  were wiped out. However, the sovereign bond market bucked the trend and prices rose,&#13;
  discounting uncertainties brought about by the anticipated hike in US interest rate and&#13;
  concerns about Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s economy. The domestic financial market remains strong, with low levels&#13;
  of non-performing loans, high capital adequacy ratios, and prudential measures in place to&#13;
  mitigate risks. Likewise, monetary policy remains supportive with room to respond to higher&#13;
  global interest rates. The peso is stable in real terms, is flexible, and is in line with market&#13;
  fundamentals, offering a cushion to large capital outflows.&#13;
&#13;
  Gains from higher revenues and unprecedented increases in the budget have yet to translate&#13;
  into commensurate increases in government spending to support an investment-led growth.&#13;
  In H1 2015, tax effort increased to 14.1 percent of GDP from 13.7 percent in H1 2014 due to&#13;
  strong private sector growth and improved tax administration. However, government spending&#13;
  continued to be slow, led by the contraction in public infrastructure spending in Q1, before&#13;
  rebounding in Q2. Since 2010, government budgets have increased by an average of 15 percent&#13;
  annually, with sharp increases coming in the latter years. Existing government systems and&#13;
  procedures are facing considerable difficulties expanding at this pace. For instance, from H1&#13;
  2014 to H1 2015, while the budget increased by 18.5 percent, government expenditures only&#13;
  increased by 8.5 percent. A counterfactual analysis shows that bringing spending closer to the&#13;
  budget could have yielded higher economic growth. For example, had the government&#13;
  increased its 2010 to 2014 average spending-to-budget ratio from 79.7 to 85 percent, GDP&#13;
  growth in the same period would have risen to an average of 6.9 percent, compared to the&#13;
  actual average of 6.2 percent.&#13;
&#13;
  In the medium-term, growth prospects remain positive. In 2016, growth is expected to&#13;
  accelerate to 6.4 percent before tempering to 6.2 percent in 2017. However, for 2015, growth&#13;
  projection is revised downwards to 5.8 percent. This takes into account the relatively weak first&#13;
  half growth brought about by slow government spending, negative net exports, and the initial&#13;
  impact of El NiÃ±o. In contrast, second half growth is projected to improve as government&#13;
  spending is ramped up. In addition, accelerated implementation of public-private partnership&#13;
  projects, valued at around 0.6 percent of GDP for 2015, and the continuing effect of lower food&#13;
  inflation and declining oil prices can further support growth. On the other hand, a stronger El&#13;
  NiÃ±o and weaker exports can pull down growth considerably.&#13;
&#13;
  Poverty reduction is expected to continue if the country is able to maintain the relatively high&#13;
  economic growth and better job trends in recent years. Using full-year estimates from the&#13;
  Family Income and Expenditure Survey, extreme poverty is projected to further decrease to 8.2&#13;
  percent in 2017 (using the new international poverty line of USD 1.90/day PPP, new 2011 PPP&#13;
  prices, and the above growth assumptions), down from 10.5 percent in 2014. Government&#13;
  transfers to poor households are projected to continue to grow. However, official poverty&#13;
  estimates are particularly sensitive to food price inflation. Even as the outlook for international&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
prices is favorable, poverty results will also depend on how the government manages its food&#13;
policy, and rice imports in particular.&#13;
&#13;
Simplifying business regulations can unleash the full potential of the private sector, in&#13;
particular, small and micro businesses, as they are important contributors to inclusive&#13;
growth. In H1 2015, private domestic demand grew by 8.1 percent compared to an economy-&#13;
wide growth of 5.3 percent. However, business regulations have long been a cumbersome&#13;
process in the Philippines. They limit the growth of innovative entrepreneurship and&#13;
investments, contribute to large scale informality, and hence prevent the country from creating&#13;
more and better jobs and reducing poverty at a faster rate. To make growth more inclusive,&#13;
reforms to simplify business regulations are needed. Priority needs to be given to three major&#13;
hindrances that affect micro and small businesses the most: starting and maintaining a&#13;
business, paying taxes, and accessing finance. These are discussed in detail in the medium-term&#13;
reform section.&#13;
&#13;
The total costs, both direct and opportunity, of starting and maintaining a business, especially&#13;
for MSMEs, need to be brought down (Special Focus 1). Reforms to reduce these costs would&#13;
free up substantial resources and make growth more inclusive. Overall, the cost imposed on&#13;
MSMEs in starting a business is very high. They not only have to pay for legitimate fees&#13;
equivalent to 17 to 36 percent of per capita income (PHP 21,000 to 45,000), they also spend a&#13;
considerable amount of time moving from one agency to another and waiting in line to process&#13;
their documents, often resulting in significant loss of productive time and income. In some&#13;
instances, businesses report that they need to pay bribes or give gifts to obtain various permits&#13;
and government services. After a business commences, numerous annual regulatory&#13;
requirements are needed to maintain the business, which can take many days every year.&#13;
Moreover, there are tax and contribution payments that have to be paid frequently within the&#13;
year. This productive time lost translates to an estimated annual opportunity cost of at least&#13;
PHP 100 billion annually. Moreover, opportunity cost of around PHP 40 billion can arise from&#13;
discouraged Filipinos who could have started a business if only the cost was reasonable. This&#13;
translates to forgone employment of around 60,000, which is equivalent to about five percent&#13;
of new labor force entrants every year.&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the adverse impact on the economy of costly business start-up, the government&#13;
has begun to address a number of doing business constraints. For instance, the government&#13;
enacted the â&#128;&#156;Go Negosyo Actâ&#128;&#157; in 2014, which calls for the establishment of service centers to&#13;
facilitate business start-up and operations of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs),&#13;
and re-engineered the process of starting a corporation in Quezon City. However, more can be&#13;
done to unleash the full potential of MSMEs. This includes: i) further simplifying and&#13;
automating key business registration processes, ii) fully implementing the Philippine business&#13;
registry and the regulatory simplification program, iii) introducing alternative payment systems&#13;
such as online and mobile payments, iv) reducing the frequency of renewals of government&#13;
licenses, permits, and clearances for employment purposes, iv) adopting a risk-based approach&#13;
for business permitting purposes, and v) simplifying the tax regime for micro and small&#13;
businesses to reduce compliance costs and encourage movement of firms to the formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               V&#13;
&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Finally, Philippine export procedures and costs are very high for small exporters (Special&#13;
  Focus 2). Export transaction costs are high, relative to its neighbors. Not only is de jure&#13;
  exporting cost very high, exporters reveal that they have to pay more than the legally-&#13;
  mandated fees to expedite the process. For small exporters, the cost of exporting can be high&#13;
  enough to discourage them from entering or remaining in business. To lower export transaction&#13;
  costs, the report recommends: i) enhancing coordination among trade-related government&#13;
  agencies through the National Single Window and improving the efficiency of Bureau of&#13;
  Customsâ&#128;&#153; information technology system, ii) establishing and publishing clear performance&#13;
  standards, and setting up a national trade website to provide information on export processes&#13;
  and procedures, and iii) eliminating or re-engineering redundant or inefficient export steps.&#13;
  These reforms would complement reforms to reduce non-tariff barriers, enhance logistics&#13;
  support, and improve productivity of key export products.&#13;
&#13;
  The remaining eight months of the Aquino Administration present an opportunity to clearly&#13;
  and practically define the â&#128;&#156;unfinished businessâ&#128;&#157; in the structural reform agenda. These are&#13;
  challenging reforms, as they would reverse decades of bad policies which have undermined the&#13;
  economyâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to generate more and better jobs. They include:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Institutionalizing current reforms to increase budget transparency and accountability,&#13;
          and laying the foundation for more comprehensive budget reforms,&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Crafting a simpler, more equitable, and more efficient tax system to finance an&#13;
          investment-led growth, in particular, rationalizing tax incentives that are neither&#13;
          transparent nor performance-based, and adjusting taxes that have not been indexed&#13;
          to inflation (i.e., taxes on petroleum products and property valuations),4&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Further opening up the economy to more competition by tackling monopolistic&#13;
          practices and reducing the investment negative list,&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Securing property rights through land governance reforms, and&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Re-engineering business regulations to make them simpler and far less costly.&#13;
&#13;
  When sustained, these reforms can support high growth, accelerate good job creation, and&#13;
  eliminate extreme poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

    The current low oil price regime provides a good opportunity to adjust petroleum excise taxes without affecting&#13;
  real income.&#13;

2.	     On the supply side, the onset of El NiÃ±o exerted a further drag on a perennially&#13;
underperforming agriculture sector (Figure 2). In the last six years, the agriculture sector grew&#13;
very slow at an average rate of 1.2 percent, the consequence of decades of policy distortions&#13;

  and underinvestment in key public goods such as irrigation. The onset of â&#128;&#156;El NiÃ±oâ&#128;&#157; in March&#13;
  2015 (see Box 3 for more discussion) further exposed the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability, contributing to&#13;
  a much slower growth of 0.3 percent. The crops sub-sector contracted by 0.5 percent,6 led by&#13;
  rice, corn, and sugarcane, all water-intensive crops. The fisheries sub-sector also declined by 2.2&#13;
  percent as El NiÃ±o has begun to affect fish distribution. Livestock and poultryâ&#128;&#148;the third&#13;
  subsectorâ&#128;&#148;may soon be affected as feed production feels the brunt of El NiÃ±o.&#13;
&#13;
  3.	    Meanwhile, growth in services and industry was respectable, although manufacturing&#13;
  decelerated significantly. The industry sector grew slower at 5.8 percent compared to 7.3&#13;
  percent in the same period in 2014, brought down by the deceleration in manufacturing growth&#13;
  from 9 to 5.3 percent. Slower manufacturing growth, in turn, was driven by food&#13;
  manufacturing,7 which grew by just 2.1 percent, reflecting lower agriculture production and&#13;
  contraction in food exports. Several other manufacturing sub-sectors also underperformed as&#13;
  exports to Japan (-7.5 percent) and China (-32 percent) fell.8 On the other hand, the services&#13;
  sector grew at a slightly slower pace of 5.8 percent relative to a year ago, but continued to be&#13;
  the main driver of growth, accounting for 3.3 percentage points (ppt), given its dominant size.&#13;
  Expansion of most sub-sectors in services continued to remain strong at more than five&#13;
  percent. Government services was the exception, which contracted by 1.8 percent.&#13;

    According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, water-intensive crops such as rice and corn were affected the&#13;
  most, contracting by 2.8 and 15.7 percent, respectively, in Q2. However, crops requiring less water such as&#13;
  pineapple, mango, abaca, monggo (mung beans), sweet potato, and cassava still grew due to hot weather&#13;
  conditions favorable to their production.&#13;

    Food manufacturing is the largest manufacturing sub-sector and typically comprises around 40 percent of total&#13;
  manufacturing output. The fast pace of population growth, at 1.9 percent, is a major driver.&#13;

4.	     On the demand side, the strong performance of private domestic demand at 8.1&#13;
percent continued to drive growth. Stronger growth of household consumption at 6.1 percent&#13;
(Figure 3), was supported by low food inflation, the continued decline in fuel prices, and&#13;
sustained increase in remittances. Stronger household consumption also suggests that more&#13;
Filipinos are recovering from the effects of natural disasters such as Typhoon Yolanda. In&#13;
addition, robust private fixed capital formation (11.2 percent growth) in both construction and&#13;
durable equipment provided additional support. Stronger growth in durable equipment at 10.4&#13;
percent and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s inclusion in the EUâ&#128;&#153;s Generalized Scheme of Preference Plus (GSP+)9&#13;
in December 2014 suggest a near-term expansion of manufacturing.10&#13;
&#13;
5.	    Government spending, which had a slow start, began to recover in Q2. Slow budget&#13;
execution continued in Q1 2015, particularly for infrastructure, due to a number of execution&#13;
bottlenecks. This resulted in the contraction of government spending by two percent, pulled&#13;
down by a 24 percent decline in public construction in Q1. Government spending recovered in&#13;
Q2 by 6.9 percent as public construction bounced back by 20.4 percent. This brought&#13;
government spending growth to three percent in H1 and contributing only 0.4 ppt to GDP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   The GSP+ grants duty free access to a number of Philippine exports. These include marine products (fisheries),&#13;
processed fruit, prepared food, animal and vegetable fats and oils, textiles, garments, and chemicals. The&#13;
government estimates that it can generate 200,000 jobs and raise exports to the EU by 11 percent (source:&#13;
Department of Trade and Industry).&#13;
10&#13;
    Despite its slowdown in H1 2015, optimism for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s manufacturing sector remains. The government&#13;
continues to support the manufacturing sector through its Manufacturing Resurgence Program (MRP), which aims&#13;
to increase the contribution of manufacturing to 30 percent of GDP and 15 percent of employment by 2025.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                          3&#13;

  growth. The fiscal policy section discusses the reasons for slow government spending in more&#13;
  detail.&#13;
&#13;
  6.	    In addition, a weaker global economy reversed the performance of merchandise&#13;
  exports, while imports continued to grow. Stagnant merchandise export growth at 0.4 percent&#13;
  in H1 largely reflected weak global demand, specifically in Japan and China. In particular,&#13;
  exports of agricultural products (-31 percent) and electronics data processing (-14 percent)&#13;
  were the hardest hit. However, despite weak global demand, total electronics exports&#13;
  recovered by 16 percent as demand from the US improved. In addition, merchandise export&#13;
  growth was outpaced by merchandise import growth, which grew by 9.8 percent. As a result,&#13;
  net exports took away some 2.6 ppt from GDP growth. Growth in merchandise imports was&#13;
  driven by a 56 percent increase in electronic parts imports. Within this product group,&#13;
  components and devices for semiconductors grew by 82 percent. This development suggests&#13;
  that growth of electronics exports will be sustained in H2 as parts are typically assembled and&#13;
  shipped in a short time span. In addition, import of office, electrical, and telecommunications&#13;
  equipment was strong and supported the growth of private investment.&#13;
&#13;
  7.	    Despite a growing trade deficit, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s current account balance remained in&#13;
  strong surplus, as exports of services and remittances remained resilient. In H1 2015, the&#13;
  current account balance yielded a surplus of USD 4.7 billion (3.3 percent of GDP) compared to&#13;
  USD 3.9 billion (2.9 percent of GDP) in H1 2014. This was fueled by the strong performance of&#13;
  services exports (growth of 9.7 percent), which is still being led by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s fast-growing&#13;
  business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. In H1 2015, the industry generated USD 8.5 billion&#13;
  in revenues and is expected to create an additional 170,000 jobs this year. Despite concerns&#13;
  about a slowing global economy, cash remittances maintained its respectable growth of 5.6&#13;
  percent. However, in recent months, households receive eight percent more in peso terms&#13;
  given the pesoâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation. Remittance growth was robust across all regions except Europe,&#13;
  which contracted by eight percent, reflecting its easing economy. Despite much lower oil prices,&#13;
  cash remittances from the Middle East remained robust, growing by 6.8 percent in the same&#13;
  period as deployment of overseas Filipino workers to the region was sustained.&#13;
&#13;
  8.	      After reaching a record high last year, net foreign direct investment (FDI) slowed in H1&#13;
  2015. The perennially low levels of FDI highlight the countryâ&#128;&#153;s low level of capital accumulation&#13;
  relative to the region.11 Through June 2015, the Philippines registered a net FDI inflow of USD 2&#13;
  billion, which was 40 percent lower than the same period in 2014. Despite the sharp decline,&#13;
  net FDI inflows in H1 2015 was comparable to the average FDI achieved since 2010.12 However,&#13;
  compared to its East Asian neighbors, FDI attraction still lags significantly behind (Figure&#13;
  4),Â  indicating much scope to improve the investment climate and open the economy to more&#13;
  foreign players (see the policy section for more discussion). For example, full liberalization of&#13;
&#13;

     H1 net FDI inflows averaged PHP 1.9 billion from 2010 to 2014.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
the Philippine banking industry in 2014 helped to attract USD 1.3 billion in FDI to the sector&#13;
from an average of just USD 35 million since 2005. On the other hand, following heightened&#13;
volatility in the global financial market, net portfolio investment reversed its trend starting Q2,&#13;
resulting in a September year-to-date net outflow of USD 64 million (see the financial sector&#13;
section for more discussion).&#13;
&#13;
9.	     With a strong current account and stable financial account, the balance of payments,&#13;
which was in deficit in 2014, returned to a surplus in H1 2015. As a result, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s gross&#13;
international reserves (GIR) recovered to USD 80.6 billion in June before falling slightly in&#13;
August to USD 80.3 billion as the central bank intervened to lessen the pesoâ&#128;&#153;s volatility. This&#13;
level of GIR remains high, is still at comfortable levels, and well in excess of the IMFâ&#128;&#153;s suggested&#13;
reserve adequacy. Reserves are enough to cover 10.3 months of imports or 4.5 times the value&#13;
of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s short-term external liability by residual maturity.13&#13;
&#13;
10.	    In Q3, available high frequency data suggest an improving economy. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
private sector is poised to continue its strong performance in Q3 2015. In particular, sustained&#13;
growth of remittances in July, which grew by almost eight percent in peso terms (given the&#13;
pesoâ&#128;&#153;s four percent depreciation in recent months), and record low inflation in July and August&#13;
are expected to drive consumption growth. In addition, the country continues to benefit from a&#13;
vibrant tourism sector, which generated 16 percent more revenues and attracted 14 percent&#13;
more tourists in July. Moreover, the public sector continues to recover. In July, government&#13;
spending increased by 25 percent, the largest increase for the year, driven by a 93 percent&#13;
increase in capital outlay. These gains are likely to offset further slowdown in external demand&#13;
as the global economy eases, and in agriculture as El NiÃ±o intensifies.14 In July, merchandise&#13;
exports and manufacturing contracted slightly. However, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s top export,&#13;
semiconductors, grew strongly by 55 percent.&#13;

&#13;
11.	   Continued job gains in the industry and services sectors could not compensate for the&#13;
substantial job losses in agriculture caused by El NiÃ±o.15 Based on the latest round of the&#13;
Labor Force Survey (LFS) in July 2015, job generation continued to be led by the services sector,&#13;
majority of which belonged to the informal services sector, followed by industry. In industry,&#13;
the construction sector, not manufacturing, drove job creation. However, job generation in&#13;

   Short-term external liability by residual maturity, as defined by the central bank, refers to external debt with&#13;
original maturity of one year or less, plus principal payments on medium and long-term loans of the public and&#13;
private sectors due in one year or less.&#13;
14&#13;
   The Philippine Statistics Authority estimates that rice production may decrease by 14 percent in Q3 2015, while&#13;
corn production is expected to remain the same compared to Q3 2014.&#13;

   This paragraph is based on government press release. Further breakdowns are not available as the July 2015&#13;
round of the Labor Force Survey (LFS) included Leyte Province while all 2014 LFS rounds excluded Leyte due to&#13;
survey constraints caused by Typhoon Yolanda.&#13;
                                                                                                                 5&#13;
&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  both services and industry were not enough to offset the substantial job losses in the&#13;
  agriculture sector, which lost some 877,000 jobs as production fell as a consequence of El NiÃ±o.&#13;
  In all, the country experienced a net loss of around 96,00016 jobs between July 2014 and July&#13;
  2015. (Figure 5).&#13;
&#13;
  12.	    Moreover, underemployment increased significantly while the labor force&#13;
  participation rate fell. Although the rate of unemployment fell to 6.5 percent in July 2015, the&#13;
  rate of underemployment increased by 2.5 ppt to 20.8 percent, indicating that the quality of&#13;
  jobs remains a challenge. High underemployment, in turn, reflects the high rate of informality,&#13;
  which covers over 75 percent of workers (see the medium-term reform section for more&#13;
  discussion). These workers are vulnerable to job losses or income shocks. At the same time, the&#13;
  labor force participation rate declined by 1.4 ppt. There are three possible reasons for the&#13;
  decline. First, the number of discouraged workers increased.17 Second, there was an increase in&#13;
  other sources of income, such as remittances, thereby reducing the need to find work. And&#13;
  third, workers are going back to school to retool. All three reasons are valid but their respective&#13;
  magnitudes are difficult to gauge. On the one hand, the stark increase in underemployment and&#13;
  net job losses suggest that job opportunities are limited and may push up the number of&#13;
  discouraged workers. On the other hand, sustained growth of remittances and the pesoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  depreciation, have led to higher household income, which may reduce the need to find work. It&#13;
  may also create incentives to go back to school, especially in light of improving public education&#13;
  system, including vocational schooling.&#13;
&#13;
  13.	    Since 2012, poverty is trending downwards, although recent data shows a slight&#13;
  uptick. After declining by three ppt between H1 2012 and H1 2013, poverty incidence increased&#13;
  by around one ppt between H1 2013 and H1 2014.18 The increase is attributed to Typhoon&#13;
  Yolanda and artificially high rice prices due to importation lags, which are believed to have&#13;
  offset income growth of the poor.19Â Even though poverty increased slightly, the overall&#13;
  downward trend still suggests that growth is becoming more inclusive. Apart from higher&#13;
  growth in recent years, the expansion of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in 2014&#13;
  is credited for raising the poorâ&#128;&#153;s income. In fact, according to the APIS, the first three income&#13;
  deciles saw the largest growth in domestic transfers (Figure 6).20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  16&#13;
     This is based on preliminary estimates and is subject to change.&#13;
  17&#13;
     Discouraged workers are those who are without a job and not seeking work because they are tired of looking for&#13;
  work or believe there is no work available. Discouraged workers who looked for a job in the six months prior to the&#13;
  interview date for the LFS were treated as unemployed.&#13;
  18&#13;
     This is based on official poverty estimates from the 2014 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS).&#13;
  19&#13;
     The tight supply of rice in H1 2014 led to a 12.2 percent increase in rice price, which could have effectively wiped&#13;
  out income growth of the poor.&#13;
  20&#13;
     In 2013, the first two income deciles experienced a 30 percent growth in domestic transfers, which includes&#13;
  transfers received from the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s CCT program. This slowed down to an average of four percent in 2014,&#13;
  as transfer income was broadly sustained. The large growth of transfer income in the third income decile suggests&#13;
  that the CCT program is reaching more poor Filipinos, as the CCT program expands.&#13;
  6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;

14.	    Like the rest of the region, the domestic financial market experienced large volatilities&#13;
in recent months but underlying fundamentals remain sound. The Philippine Stock Exchange&#13;
had a strong start in the year with its main index (PSEi) reaching a record high of 8,127 points&#13;
in April 2015 or 12.4 percent higher compared to the start of the year (Figure 7). However,&#13;
concerns brought about by the timing of the US Federal Reserveâ&#128;&#153;s interest rate hike have&#13;
dampened expectations for the local equity market. More recently, the rapid decline of Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
stock market, together with the depreciation of its currency and concerns about a more&#13;
pronounced slowdown, contributed to a sell-off in the local stock market, which wiped out&#13;
year-to-date gains. On August 24â&#128;&#148;the new â&#128;&#156;Black Mondayâ&#128;&#157;â&#128;&#148;the PSEi, contracted by 6.7&#13;
percent. This was the fourth largest decline since the global financial crisis of 2008.21&#13;
&#13;
15.	   However, the bond market saw prices rise. Despite expectation of higher interest rates&#13;
and the turmoil in the China, bond prices increased slightly as a result of the low inflation&#13;
outlook and as investors rebalanced their asset holdings. For instance, bond prices of the&#13;
benchmark ROP 2032 and 2034 (i.e., government external debt papers) increased from 146 to&#13;
156 and 156 to 163, respectively, since the start of the year (Figure 8).&#13;

  16.	    Increased volatility in global financial markets have led to a sharp reversal in net&#13;
  foreign portfolio investments (FPI), leading to a net outflow in the first eight months of the&#13;
  year. After posting net inflows of USD 1.8 billion in the first two months of 2015, consecutive&#13;
  net outflows since March led to a year-to-date net outflow of USD 64 million by September&#13;
  2015. Capital outflow and regional currency depreciation led by the Chinese yuan have exerted&#13;
  pressure for the peso to depreciate against the US dollar by almost five percent as of&#13;
  September, resulting in its lowest value in five years. However, in real terms, the peso remained&#13;
  stable in recent months after appreciating for almost a decade now (Figure 9), making it one of&#13;
  the strongest currencies in the region in real terms. This has naturally led to concerns about the&#13;
  competitiveness of Philippine exports.22&#13;

  17.	    The domestic financial market remains strong with a number of prudential measures&#13;
  in place to mitigate risks. However, careful monitoring is still needed given the possibility of&#13;
  more global volatility and certain data gaps. Non-performing loans are very low at 2.4 percent&#13;
  of total loan portfolio (TLP) and the banking sector is well capitalized at more than twice the&#13;
  Basel standard of eight percent and higher than BSPâ&#128;&#153;s 10 percent standard, providing sufficient&#13;
  capital to absorb any possible shock on their credit exposures.23 A number of macro-financial&#13;
  prudential measures are also in place to mitigate risks. In particular, lending to real estate is&#13;

     Under BSP Circular 839, universal and commercial banks must meet the requirement of 10 percent capital&#13;
  adequacy ratio of qualifying capital. Their subsidiary thrift banks are also required to maintain a common equity&#13;
  tier one level of at least six percent of qualifying capital.&#13;

capped at 20 percent of TLP under a more conservative measure.24 However, measuring the&#13;
exposure of non-bank financial institutions to real estate credit suffers from data gaps.25 Finally,&#13;
the peso remains flexible and is broadly in line with market fundamentals, providing a cushion&#13;
for large capital outflows.&#13;

18.	    CPI inflation continued to decelerate, averaging 1.7 percent in the first eight months&#13;
of 2015, below the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s target of two to four percent for 2015. Several supply side&#13;
factors explain the slower rate of inflation, which reached 0.6 percent in August (Figure 10).&#13;
Lower inflation was driven by the deceleration of food inflation to 1.2 percent in August from&#13;
8.3 percent a year ago as ample inventory26 kept food supply sufficient despite lower&#13;
agriculture output (Table 2). In particular, timely and adequate importation of rice kept prices&#13;
from increasing as it did last year.27 In addition, oil prices, which fell by 54 percent in August&#13;

   Under BSPâ&#128;&#153;s Memorandum No. M-2012-036, which supplements BSP Circular 600, the BSP lifted all exemptions&#13;
in the computation of bank exposure to real estate and expanded them to cover funds channeled into securities of&#13;
property firms. The guidelines under the memorandum provide a more comprehensive measure of banksâ&#128;&#153; 20&#13;
percent cap on real estate exposure.&#13;

   For instance, rice inventory increased by 31 percent.&#13;
27&#13;
   The total volume of rice imports reached 1.8 million metric tons (mt) as of September 2015. This includes&#13;
500,000 mt imported in February, 250,000 mt in June, and 250,000 mt in September, all via the government-to-&#13;
government procurement scheme. In addition, the private sector was contracted to import 787,000 mt under the&#13;
minimum access volume (MAV) commitment for the year.&#13;
                                                                                                                                   9&#13;

  2015 compared to the same period in 2014,28 also contributed to lower inflation given its pass&#13;
  through on electricity, transportation, and manufactured goods prices. On the other hand, core&#13;
  inflation, which excludes certain food and energy items to better capture underlying price&#13;
  volatilities, was higher at 2.2 percent year-to-date. This suggests that low inflation is largely&#13;
  driven by volatile goods and is transitory in nature, and is not indicative of the slowing&#13;
  economy.&#13;

  19.	    Monetary policy remains supportive with room to respond to higher global interest&#13;
  rates. Given the relatively stable inflation outlook, the Monetary Board kept policy rates steady,&#13;
  but announced that it was prepared to respond to developments in the global market. Since&#13;
  mid-September 2014, overnight borrowing and lending rates remained at four and six percent,&#13;
  respectively. The interest rate on special deposit accounts (SDA) also remained steady at 2.5&#13;
  percent and the reserve requirement ratio was also left unchanged at 20 percent for universal&#13;
  and commercial banks and eight percent for thrift banks. These have helped keep money&#13;
  supply (M3) growth stable, growing by an average of nine percent through June 2015,&#13;
  compared to an average of 33 percent over the same period in 2014 (Figure 11).&#13;

&#13;
20.	    Continuous improvement in tax effort is helping build adequate fiscal space for the&#13;
government to ramp up investment to accelerate growth. Tax effort increased to 14.1 percent&#13;
of GDP in H1 2015 from 13.7 percent of GDP in H1 2014. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR),&#13;
which accounts for around 80 percent of total tax revenues, collected 10 percent more taxes&#13;
compared to the same period in 2014. In the absence of new tax policy, the BIR continues to&#13;
rely on improved tax administration and higher private sector growth to meet its collection&#13;
target. In contrast, collections by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) increased by only three percent&#13;
in H1 2015, driven by the decline in oil prices over the past year.29&#13;
&#13;
21.	   However, gains from higher revenues and unprecedented increases in the budget&#13;
have yet to translate into commensurate increases in government spending. Since 2010,&#13;
government budgets have increased by an average annual rate of 15 percent, with sharp&#13;
increases coming in the latter years. Existing government systems and procedures face&#13;
considerable difficulties expanding at this pace. From H1 2014 to H1 2015, while government&#13;
budget increased by 18.5 percent, government expenditures only increased by 8.5 percent. This&#13;
slow pace is most evident in Typhoon Yolanda reconstruction spending,30 which indicates that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29&#13;
   The BOC estimates that it is likely to lose some PHP 40 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) in VAT revenues due to lower&#13;
oil prices.&#13;
30&#13;
   As of June 30, 2015, only 53 percent of the total PHP 167 billion Yolanda rehabilitation fund was released to&#13;
different agencies, more than a year and a half after the typhoon hit the country.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                     11&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  existing government systems are not designed to cope with large increases in the budget.&#13;
  According to the government, slow disbursement is largely the result of structural weaknesses&#13;
  within key departments and agencies, which includes i) poor planning, ii) weak program and&#13;
  project design, and iii) procurement difficulties such as frequent bid failures, weak capacity to&#13;
  procure, right-of-way-issues, difficulties in securing permits, and coordination problems. To&#13;
  address budget execution bottlenecks, the president issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 46 in&#13;
  March 2015 to improve spending efficiency and expedite the implementation of priority&#13;
  programs and projects under the 2015 budget.31 Procurement units are also being&#13;
  strengthened, including provision of extra staff positions in the bids and awards committee. In&#13;
  addition, amendments to right of way acquisition are being discussed in congress to address&#13;
  procurement bottlenecks.&#13;
&#13;
  22.	    In particular, public infrastructure spending contracted in Q1 2015 before rebounding&#13;
  in Q2. In Q1, public infrastructure spending fell by 11 percent in nominal terms but recovered in&#13;
  Q2 by 37 percent, in line with the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s pronouncements to ramp up spending for the&#13;
  rest of the year. While not part of the budget, construction of much needed public&#13;
  infrastructure projects could see a boost from the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s public-private partnership&#13;
  (PPP) program. After much delay, the Muntinlupa-Cavite expressway, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s first PPP&#13;
  road project, was opened in July 2015. Another project, the automatic fare collection system,&#13;
  which unites the ticketing and fare collection for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s various railway lines, is currently&#13;
  undergoing public testing and is expected to be fully operational shortly. Following its&#13;
  completion, the government expects to see three more PPP projects completed by 2016 (Table&#13;
  3). However, challenges still remain, as multiple hurdles such as right-of-way issues, bidding&#13;
  failures, and other legal complications have caused a number of PPP projects to fall behind&#13;
  schedule.&#13;
&#13;
  23.	     The countryâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal position is sustainable. In H1 2015, the government recorded a&#13;
  budget surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP before returning to a year-to-date deficit of PHP 18.5&#13;
  billion in July. Prudent fiscal management has resulted in better financing terms and sustained&#13;
  decline in its debt burden. The government continues to have a fully funded fiscal deficit with&#13;
  an efficient mix of local and foreign sources. Borrowing costs continue to decline, which has&#13;
  also allowed the government to swap old, high cost, short-term debt for newer, lower cost,&#13;
  long-term debt. For instance, the latest domestic debt swap enabled the government to save&#13;
  PHP 2.4 billion in interest expense. In H1 2015, the national government debt to GDP ratio&#13;
  improved to 44.9 percent of GDP, on track to meet the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s goal of 40 percent in the&#13;
  medium-term. Total external debt is also falling at a similar pace towards 20 percent in the&#13;
  medium-term from 25.7 percent of GDP in H1 2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  31&#13;
     Under AO 46, agencies are required to complete the disaggregation of project listings and submit all&#13;
  documentary requirements for their allotment releases by end-April. They are also required to submit to the&#13;
  Department of Budget and Management and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary the implementation plans for&#13;
  programs and projects noted in the 2015 General Appropriations Act.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.	   Going forward, the government needs to review and improve budget planning and&#13;
execution so that improved revenues can translate into better spending and improved public&#13;
investment. This calls for effectively addressing key bottlenecks including procurement issues,&#13;
and reforming the public financial management system (see the prospects and policies sections&#13;
for more discussion).&#13;

  25.	    The Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; strong macroeconomic fundamentals provide the necessary&#13;
  conditions for rapid, sustained, and inclusive growth. The country is increasingly characterized&#13;
  by robust economic growth, low and stable inflation, healthy current account surplus, more-&#13;
  than-adequate international reserves, and a sustainable fiscal position (Figure 12)â&#128;&#148;a&#13;
  combination never seen in its history. Globally, this strong performance was recognized by all&#13;
  three major credit rating agencies with sovereign credit rating upgrades to two notches above&#13;
  investment grade and by a record high foreign direct investment inflows last year. With a solid&#13;
  macroeconomy that has proven to be resilient against shocks, the country can now focus its&#13;
  attention on implementing crucial structural reforms that can sustain growth, create more and&#13;
  better jobs, and eradicate extreme poverty.&#13;

  26.	    Near term economic growth will remain robust and is projected to improve from 5.8&#13;
  percent in 2015 to 6.4 percent in 2016 (Table 4). Lower 2015 growth takes into account the&#13;
  relatively weak first half growth brought about by slow government spending, negative net&#13;
  exports, and the initial impact of El NiÃ±o. Second half growth is projected to improve as&#13;
  government spending catches up. In addition, accelerated implementation of public-private&#13;

partnership (PPP) projects, valued at 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015, and the continuing effect of&#13;
lower food inflation and declining oil prices can further support growth (see Box 1 for more&#13;
discussion). Lower prices of oil and slower inflation of other commodities has enabled the&#13;
central bank to keep key rates low to support growth. However, a stronger El NiÃ±o and weaker&#13;
exports can pull down growth considerably.33 In 2016, growth is expected to accelerate to&#13;
6.4 percent as the country recovers from the 2015 slowdown and as election spending lifts&#13;
government spending34 before tempering to 6.2 percent in 2017.&#13;

27.	    Poverty reduction is expected to continue if the country is able to maintain relatively&#13;
high economic growth and better job trends in recent years, despite recent shocks to&#13;
agriculture. Using full-year estimates from the 2012 Family Income and Expenditure Survey,&#13;
poverty is estimated to have decreased from 11.2 percent in 2012 to 10.5 percent in 2014 and&#13;
is projected to decrease further to 8.2 percent in 2017 (using the new international poverty line&#13;
of USD 1.90/day purchasing power parity [PPP], new 2011 PPP prices, and the above growth&#13;
assumptions). Although government spending was reduced overall in 2015, government&#13;
transfers to poor households were not impacted and are being ramped-up. However, official&#13;
poverty estimates are particularly sensitive to food price inflation. Even as the outlook for&#13;
international prices is favorable, poverty results will also depend on how the government&#13;
manages its food policy, and in particular, rice imports.&#13;

   The current El NiÃ±o is projected to be one of the strongest in history. The two strongest El NiÃ±o episodes in&#13;
1982-83 and 1997-98 led to a contraction in agriculture by four and seven percent, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
                   Box 1. Lower oil and rice prices: potential impact on growth and poverty&#13;
&#13;
  Over the past year and a half, oil prices have fallen significantly, and are likely to stay below USD 60&#13;
  per barrel over the medium-term. Previous episodes of major oil price declines35 were more transitory&#13;
  in nature (i.e., 1991 Gulf war, 1997 Asian financial crisis, 2001 September 11 attacks and the dot-com&#13;
  bubble, and 2008 global financial crisis). In contrast, the current decline in oil prices appears to be more&#13;
  prolonged due to both supply and demand factors: i) expansion of non-OPEC sources of oil such as&#13;
  shale, ii) change in OPEC policy stance from price targeting to market share protection, and iii) the global&#13;
  economic slowdown, led by China.&#13;
&#13;
  Given that the country is a major net importer of oil, the Philippine economy stands to benefit&#13;
  significantly. Lower oil prices will have direct and indirect effects on growth. Using the 2006 input-&#13;
  output table, the economy wide share of petroleum to total production cost is around eight percent. In&#13;
  industry, this is higher at almost 11 percent. This means that the halving of oil prices since 2014 could&#13;
  have reduced the cost of goods by roughly five percent, not including multiplier effects. All in all,&#13;
  through various transmission channels such as greater consumption and a lower import bill, the country&#13;
  is estimated to gain an additional one-half to one ppt in GDP growth in 2015.36&#13;
&#13;
  Lower oil prices and low food inflation also affect households positively, and more so among poor37&#13;
  households given that food accounts for 40 percent of their consumption basket. Households directly&#13;
  benefit from lower food and transportation costs, and indirectly from lower input costs for agriculture&#13;
  and lower manufactured goods prices. Even smallholder farmers can benefit from lower commodity&#13;
  prices, as most of them are net food buyers, even if they are involved in agricultural production.&#13;
&#13;
  While the precise impact of lower food and oil prices is difficult to measure, the household survey&#13;
  suggests that it can be significant. For instance, using the 2012 Family Income and Expenditure Survey,&#13;
  the average poor household can save around PHP 6,000 annually (equivalent to around 32 percent of&#13;
  the national poverty gap) from lower oil, transport, and rice prices.38 Compared to the average price of&#13;
  oil in 2014, the poor have effectively gained PHP 4,400 year-to-date due to low oil prices. If oil prices fall&#13;
  further as projected and this is completely passed on to consumers, and rice prices stay at their current&#13;
  levels, the poor could save an additional PHP 1,600 for the rest of the year.39 This is money that can be&#13;
  used to increase basic consumption and bring some households out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  35&#13;
     An oil price decline is considered a major episode if the decrease in crude oil prices surpassed 30 percent over a&#13;
  six month period.&#13;
  36&#13;
      See the East Asia and Pacific Update April 2015 edition for more discussion. This report is available at:&#13;
  http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap/publication/east-asia-pacific-economic-update&#13;
  37&#13;
     In this box, the poor is defined as the bottom 30 percent of the population, roughly coinciding with the official&#13;
  poverty incidence.&#13;
  38&#13;
      Together, these three items account for around 32 percent of the total consumption basket of the poor,&#13;
  compared to only 22 percent for the rest of the population.&#13;
  39&#13;
     The consumption of oil and rice by the poor in 2014 is projected from the 2012 FIES by applying the historical&#13;
  growth rate of consumption compared to the 2009 FIES. The projected expenditure in 2014 is divided by the&#13;
  average prices in 2014 to get the quantity consumed. This quantity is then multiplied with the prevailing (lower)&#13;
  price, and the product is subtracted from the 2014 consumption to get potential savings in 2015, which could be&#13;
  used to increase other consumption and thus overall welfare.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the poor can benefit even further if excise taxes on petroleum products are increased and the&#13;
revenue is redistributed in the form of better social services, including social protection. Raising excise&#13;
taxes on petroleum products is equitable as consumption of petroleum products is highly skewed&#13;
towards the rich (i.e., the richest 10 percent consumes almost 60 percent of total petroleum products).40&#13;
Box 3 of the January 2015 edition of the Philippine economic update discusses an option to raise some&#13;
PHP 20 billion in petroleum excise taxes that the government could use to help address poverty.&#13;

28.	    With private domestic demand growing by an average of 6.9 percent since 2010,41&#13;
realizing the administrationâ&#128;&#153;s end-term growth target of seven to eight percent will primarily&#13;
hinge on its ability to significantly increase public spending to offset weak external demand.&#13;
This requires spending 95 percent of the primary budget instead of the average trend of 79.7&#13;
percent (see Box 2 for more discussion). In the short-term, meeting the 95 percent target&#13;
requires more effectively addressing well known procurement bottleneck issues. In the long-&#13;
term, significant reforms in the public financial management system are necessary to address&#13;
limited absorptive capacity of the government in light of the growing fiscal space (see the policy&#13;
section for more discussion).&#13;

                                               Box 2. What if the government spent the budget as planned?&#13;
&#13;
  A simple static analysis (without multiplier effects) shows that if the government spent closer to the&#13;
  budget, growth would be higher, even reaching the administrationâ&#128;&#153;s end-term target of seven to eight&#13;
  percent.42 Despite the vibrant performance of the private sector, slow public spending of around 4.5&#13;
  percent since 2010 has significantly limited economic growth. With an average spending-to-primary&#13;
  budget ratio43 of 79.7 percent, GDP growth averaged 6.2 percent from 2010 to 2014, significantly lower&#13;
  than the eight percent high-end target by 2016. If the spending ratio had improved by five percentage&#13;
  points (ppt) each year to 85 percent, average GDP growth could have been 6.9 percent. With a 15 ppt a&#13;
  year improvement to 95 percent, average growth would reach 8.2 percent. However, this assumes that&#13;
  ramping up spending does not entail significant productivity and efficiency losses.&#13;

  29.	   The government has identified a number of executive and legislative measures to&#13;
  speed up public spending, especially on infrastructure. These measuresâ&#128;&#148;reducing lump sums,&#13;
  more proactive management of procurement delays (as provided by AO 46), shift to bank&#13;
  processing of payments, amendments to the right-of-way acquisition and the build-operate-&#13;
  transfer law, and a new public financial management lawâ&#128;&#148;need to be fast-tracked if they are&#13;
  to make a difference on 2015 and 2016 growth.&#13;
&#13;
  30.	    Efforts are also needed to fast-track bidding and implementation of the PPP program.&#13;
  Currently, there are 15 projects worth PHP 503.1 billion (four percent of 2014 GDP) that are at&#13;
  least in the bidding stage, including 10 projects that were already awarded, have started&#13;
  construction, or nearing completion. With construction costs assumed to be spread equally&#13;
  over their projected duration, PPPs are projected to raise investments by 0.6 percent of GDP in&#13;
  2015 and 0.8 percent of GDP in 2016. In addition, up to 18 more PPPs are expected to be&#13;
  approved by June 2016, including the biggest PPP in history, the North-South commuter rail,&#13;

    Growth of at least eight percent in a single year has not been achieved since the 1970s.&#13;

     Government spending is defined as the sum of government consumption and public construction from the&#13;
  national income accounts. Primary budget is equal to the sum of new appropriations, continuing appropriations,&#13;
  supplemental appropriations, and automatic appropriations less interest payment. Interest payment is deducted&#13;
  since it does not affect GDP.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
worth around PHP 171 billion (1.4 percent of GDP). Fast-tracking would shift spending to earlier&#13;
years and reap multiplier effects to spur growth in the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
31.	    Higher spending that is in line with budget targets will not increase the countryâ&#128;&#153;s debt&#13;
burden. National government debt has gone down significantly from 75 percent of GDP a&#13;
decade ago to just 45 percent of GDP in 2014. Debt service as share of revenues fell even more,&#13;
from 85 percent in 2006 to just 27 percent in 2014, freeing up a lot of resources for an&#13;
investment-led growth, which should be a priority given a falling output gap. With good fiscal&#13;
management, the government can afford a deficit equivalent to two percent of GDP and still&#13;
see its debt burden fall in the medium-term even with an interest rate or exchange rate shock&#13;
(Figures 14 and 15). Raising fiscal space beyond moderate deficit spending requires new&#13;
sources of tax revenues (see the policy section for more discussion).&#13;

32.	     Near-term growth projections are tilted towards the downside. Philippine external&#13;
demand hinges primarily on the strength of recovery of the US, Euro, and Japanese&#13;
economies. These economies account for about half of Philippine exports, not including&#13;
Chinese-assembled electronic products using Philippine-made parts. However, Philippine&#13;
merchandise exports are not expected to return to pre-crisis growth rates as global trade&#13;
remains sluggish in the medium-term. To raise external demand amidst slower trade and more&#13;
global competition, the Philippines needs to start raising productivity to lower unit labor cost,&#13;
especially in light of an appreciating peso in real terms. Increasing infrastructure, reducing non-&#13;
tariff barriers, and improving logistics support are all needed.&#13;
&#13;
33.	   The upcoming increase in US policy rates may yet again disrupt the local financial&#13;
market. The long anticipated tightening of US monetary policy is likely to begin in Q4 2015.&#13;
However, unlike the taper tantrum in 2013, the local markets have internalized the inevitable&#13;
increase in interest rates, and as such, the impact on the financial market should be more&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                       19&#13;

  manageable. Capital outflow is still likely, but the countryâ&#128;&#153;s strong fundamentals will cushion its&#13;
  transmission into the real sector. Moreover, room for domestic monetary policy tightening&#13;
  exists given improving growth prospects and manageable inflation.&#13;
&#13;
  34.	    But the greater concern lies in its impact on the cost of financing, both for the public&#13;
  and private sectors. The Philippine economy has benefited significantly over the years from the&#13;
  low interest rate environment. Lower borrowing costs have helped create significant fiscal&#13;
  space while allowing debt burden to fall substantially. It has also helped boost the construction&#13;
  and real estate sectors. All these are about to change as domestic interest rates rise in response&#13;
  to higher US policy rates, and this will have a more material impact on near-term growth as&#13;
  opposed to short-term capital outflow. Responding to this threat lies in both securing long-term&#13;
  fiscal space through revenue mobilization (see the policy section for more discussion) and&#13;
  macro-financial prudential measures to manage risk from increasing leverage.&#13;
&#13;
  35.	    Closer to home, while the Chinese stock market volatility poses little risk for the&#13;
  Philippine financial sector, the effect of a Chinese slowdown could be more pronounced.44&#13;
  Financial linkages between China and the Philippines are low, thus capital outflows stemming&#13;
  from the volatile Chinese financial market are manageable. However, Philippine exports to&#13;
  China comprise around 13 percent of total exports and thus could have some effect on growth.&#13;
  On the one hand, agricultural exports to China are rising (currently valued at USD 400 million)&#13;
  and could affect farmersâ&#128;&#153; income.45 On the other hand, as the bulk of exports to China are&#13;
  electronic parts, exports to China may not fall significantly as final demand for electronics&#13;
  comes predominantly from high-income countries, reflecting Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s role as a global assembly&#13;
  hub for these products. Moreover, the Chinese yuanâ&#128;&#153;s depreciation can make its exports more&#13;
  competitive, thereby benefiting the Philippines as it is a key supplier of parts. Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s slowdown&#13;
  could also have more pronounced effects on tourism, as China is fast becoming a major source&#13;
  of foreign tourists for the Philippines. Tourist arrivals from China have grown exponentially&#13;
  from just 15,000 in 2000 to almost half a million in 2014. The key response to slower external&#13;
  demand from China is to improve productivity on the goods side and improve tourism&#13;
  infrastructure and facilities on the services side.&#13;
&#13;
  36.	    On the domestic side, El NiÃ±o is the main threat, not so much on GDP growth per se&#13;
  but on the quality of growth, as tens of millions of farmersâ&#128;&#153; lives may be affected. Current&#13;
  growth projections assume that agriculture will not expand in 2015 given the adverse effects of&#13;
  El NiÃ±o. However, a stronger El NiÃ±o could lead to a major contraction in agriculture, thereby&#13;
  pulling down GDP growth and more importantly farmersâ&#128;&#153; income, while increasing inflation.&#13;
  Simulations show that if agriculture contracts by four percent, as in the 1983 El NiÃ±o, GDP&#13;
  growth in 2015 could drop to 5.4 percent, holding other factors constant. If agriculture&#13;

     For instance, in 2012, the local banana industry suffered when exports to China were halted due to phyto-&#13;
  sanitary concerns.&#13;

&#13;
contracts by seven percent, as in the 1998 El NiÃ±o, GDP growth could drop to as low as 5.1&#13;
percent.46 With a fall in farm production, farm prices will inevitably lead to higher inflation,&#13;
once the currently adequate food inventory is depleted. The combined effect of higher food&#13;
prices and lower farm output will have significant impact on poverty (see Box 3 for more&#13;
discussion on El NiÃ±o). The key response to El NiÃ±o in the immediate-term is to ensure&#13;
adequate food stock, especially through timely importation of rice and other key food items. In&#13;
the medium-term, reforms in food policy are essential (see the January 2015 edition of the&#13;
Philippine economic update for more discussion).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                Box 3. The likely consequences of El NiÃ±o and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s response&#13;
&#13;
Latest forecasts indicate that the current El NiÃ±o episode may rival the 1997-98 episode, which&#13;
resulted in a large contraction in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector. The strongest episode of El NiÃ±o was&#13;
recorded in 1997-1998, causing a dry spell from June 1997 to August 1998.47 As a result, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
agriculture sector contracted by seven percent in 1998, with a negative contribution of one ppt to&#13;
overall growth. The losses in agriculture were highlighted by double digit declines in output for the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s major crops such as rice, sugar, and yellow corn. The large contraction in output caused a&#13;
significant increase in food prices, as food inflation rose to 8.3 percent in 1998 compared to 2.9 percent&#13;
in 1997. Had the government not over-imported rice in 1998, food inflation could have been much&#13;
higher.&#13;
&#13;
As a consequence, the impact of El NiÃ±o on poverty was pronounced. Datt and Hoogeveen (2000)&#13;
showed using the 1998 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS) that the combined effects of the&#13;
financial crisis of 1997 and the 1997-98 episode of El NiÃ±o resulted in an increase in poverty incidence&#13;
from 29.1 to 31.7 percent in 1998. The El NiÃ±o shock alone contributed about 46 percent to the increase&#13;
in the poverty incidence.&#13;
&#13;
The current episode of El NiÃ±o has begun to take its toll on the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector, albeit not&#13;
yet as pronounced as the 1997-98 episode. In H1 2015, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s agriculture sector grew by only 0.3&#13;
percent, with bleak outlook for the rest of the year as the government expects 70 out of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
81 provinces likely to be affected by drought by year end.48 The Department of Agriculture (DA)&#13;
estimates that the agriculture sector already incurred PHP 3.3 billion in production losses due to El NiÃ±o&#13;
as of August. Despite the negative impact on output, food inflation is still low, in large part due to&#13;
adequate and timely importation of rice, which has dampened the effects of lower farm output on&#13;
prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46&#13;
   The fall in GDP growth as a result of agriculture contraction is likely to be less severe nowadays given that&#13;
agriculture value-added now comprises just 11 percent of total value-added.&#13;
47&#13;
   As a comparison, the agriculture sector also experienced a contraction in the 1982-83 episode of El NiÃ±oâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
second strongest in historyâ&#128;&#148;with agriculture contracting by four percent and food inflation rising to 8.6 percent.&#13;
48&#13;
    Based on statistical analysis by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services&#13;
Administration (PAGASA) using historical and just-in-time rainfall data, provinces that are projected to be least&#13;
affected by El NiÃ±o are: Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Compostela Valley,&#13;
Davao del Norte, and Davao Occidental, all from eastern Mindanao; Benguet, Ifugao, and Mountain Province, all&#13;
from the Luzon highlands; and Siquijor in Visayas.&#13;
                                                                                                               21&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  For the rest of 2015 to early 2016, the effects of El NiÃ±o on farm output may pose an upside risk to&#13;
  inflation and poverty as the current bout of El NiÃ±o is expected to intensify in the last quarter of the&#13;
  year and persist until early 2016.49 Indicative simulation shows that if food inflation increased to 8.3&#13;
  percent similar to the 1998 episode, then poverty incidence could increase by around 0.8 ppt in 2016&#13;
  compared to 2014.50 As a response, the government is carefully monitoring the situation and planning&#13;
  the appropriate rice import quantity. In September 2015, the government bid out contracts to import&#13;
  750,000 metric tons of rice to serve as buffer stock in case El NiÃ±o intensifies and adversely impacts&#13;
  domestic rice production. Furthermore, the DA has requested a supplemental budget of PHP 1.9&#13;
  billion,51 while the National Economic and Development Authority has created a task force to help&#13;
  mitigate the negative effects of El NiÃ±o. The government has indicated that it will continue to monitor&#13;
  the supply of rice and stands ready to import rice to keep prices stable.&#13;

&#13;
  37.	    The remaining eight months of the Aquino Administration present an opportunity to&#13;
  clearly and practically define the unfinished business in the structural reform agenda. These&#13;
  are challenging reforms, as they would reverse decades of policies which have undermined the&#13;
  economyâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to generate more and better jobs. They include i) institutionalizing current&#13;
  reforms to increase budget transparency and accountability, ii) crafting a simpler, more&#13;
  equitable, and more efficient tax system to finance an investment-led growth, iii) further&#13;
  opening up the economy to more competition by reducing the investment negative list, iv)&#13;
  securing property rights through land governance reforms, and v) unleashing the full potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  49&#13;
     The current bout of El NiÃ±o is expected to peak in November 2015 and will likely continue until March to April&#13;
  2016.&#13;
  50&#13;
     The 2014 APIS was used to run the simulation. To compute for poverty incidence in 2016, the following steps&#13;
  were taken: i) compute 2016 projected per capita income by using 2014 per capita income as base and income&#13;
  growth from 2012 to 2013 of 3.5 percent compounded for the bottom 50 percent (income growth from 2013 to&#13;
  2014 is not used given the presence of exogenous shocks), ii) compute projected 2016 poverty threshold by&#13;
  adjusting the 2014 poverty threshold under the assumption of two percent overall inflation in 2015, 8.3 percent&#13;
  food inflation in 2016, and three percent non-food inflation in 2016, and iii) count the number of poor households&#13;
  whose income falls below the poverty threshold in 2016.&#13;
  51&#13;
     The proposed supplemental budget is broken down into i) production support for rice, corn, high-value crops,&#13;
  livestock (PHP 804 million), ii) water management (PHP 989 million), iii) information and education campaign (PHP&#13;
  73 million), and iv) project management (PHP 65 million).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
of the private sector, in particular, small and micro firms, by re-engineering business regulations&#13;
to make them simpler and far less costly. When sustained, these reforms can sustain high&#13;
growth, accelerate good job creation, and eliminate extreme poverty.&#13;
&#13;
38.	     The Aquino Administration made substantial progress on improving the&#13;
macroeconomy and governance, in particular, with respect to fighting corruption and&#13;
increasing transparency. This improved macro-governance climate provided an environment&#13;
conducive to inclusive growth. In 2010, the reform-minded Aquino Administration commenced&#13;
office with a strong governance agenda and commitment to strengthen macroeconomic&#13;
stability. These efforts have borne fruit and are well recognized locally and globally. At home,&#13;
according to a recent survey by the Social Weather Stations, 41 percent of Filipinos are satisfied&#13;
with the government52 even on its last yearâ&#128;&#148;a feat that no recent administration had&#13;
achieved.53 Globally, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s rank in Transparency Internationalâ&#128;&#153;s Corruption Perceptions&#13;
Index improved by 49 places from 134 in 2010 to 85 in 2014. In addition, as discussed above,&#13;
the country is now rated two notches above investment grade by all three major credit rating&#13;
agenciesâ&#128;&#148;a testament to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s strong macroeconomic fundamentals.&#13;
&#13;
39.	   The administrationâ&#128;&#153;s focus on improving fiscal revenues and public financial&#13;
management allowed a considerable ramping up of spending, including on programs which&#13;
benefit the poor directly. The proposed budget for 2016 is nearly double than that of 2010,&#13;
implying an annual growth rate of about 12 percent. This is substantial by international&#13;
standards. One fiscal management measure which paid off significantly was enabled by better&#13;
creditworthiness of the country. In particular, it allowed the government to replace high-cost&#13;
with low-cost debt. This caused debt servicing as a percentage of government revenues to&#13;
decline from 53 percent in 2011 to 27 percent in 2014.&#13;
&#13;
40.	    The growing fiscal space was rightly targeted towards priority areas, led by social&#13;
services. The budget for education, health, and social protection grew by almost three times&#13;
between 2010 and 2016. As a result, the country today has a world class conditional cash&#13;
transfer (CCT) program that replaced a corrupt patronage system of subsidies. The public&#13;
education system now provides 13 years of free schooling. Universal healthcare coverage is&#13;
close to being achieved. A larger budget for community-driven development and bottom-up&#13;
budgeting programs is giving the people direct voice in development interventions.&#13;
Infrastructure spending, while progressing slower, has also been ramped-up, with the aim of&#13;
reaching five percent of GDP by 2016. These spending reforms were made possible by better&#13;
tax administration and the passage of the â&#128;&#156;sin taxâ&#128;&#157; law, both of which created significant fiscal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   The net satisfaction rating is defined by the SWS as the difference between the percent of respondents who say&#13;
they are satisfied with the president and the percent of respondents who say that they are unsatisfied with the&#13;
president.&#13;
53&#13;
   In the third quarter preceding a presidential election, no other president among the last four surpassed a net&#13;
satisfaction rating of 40 percent (i.e., C. Aquino: 10 percent, Ramos: 35 percent, Estrada: impeached, and Arroyo:&#13;
negative 38 percent!).&#13;
                                                                                                               23&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  space of around 1.9 percent of GDP, and by better transparency and accountability of public&#13;
  spending.&#13;
&#13;
  41.	   On the structural reform agenda, the Aquino Administration has begun to address&#13;
  decades-long constraints that have held back the potential of the private sector. These&#13;
  reforms include:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Passing an overarching competition policy law: Under the competition law, economic&#13;
          agents can be charged with monopolistic behavior. The law has been decades in the&#13;
          making, as it was always successfully opposed by the large business conglomerates.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Allowing foreign transshipment of goods: Cabotage liberalization was another long-&#13;
          awaited, but nonetheless welcome structural reform with the objective of increasing&#13;
          competition in order to bring down transportation costs and improve safety standards.&#13;
          The new law allows foreign ships to on and off-load foreign freight along domestic&#13;
          routes, instead of being forced to completely on and off-load in one international port.&#13;
          The reform is not a full liberalization, as foreign ships will not be allowed to take in&#13;
          domestic cargo, but it is a good start. In addition, implementing rules and regulation still&#13;
          need to be drafted.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Fully liberalizing the banking industry: The banking sector liberalization opens up the&#13;
          banking sector to foreign competitionâ&#128;&#148;five foreign banks have already been approved&#13;
          for entry. Moreover, full liberalization in 2014 helped to attract USD 1.3 billion in FDI to&#13;
          the financial sector from an average of just USD 35 million since 2005.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Simplifying business registration: Finally, progress was made on key aspects of the&#13;
          investment climate for SMEs, including business registration. However, the positive legal&#13;
          and regulatory reforms undertaken seem to need stronger coordination and&#13;
          enforcement on the ground to ensure that SMEs actually experience an improved&#13;
          investment climate.&#13;
&#13;
  Moreover, the push for the rationalization of fiscal incentives will likely attract rather than&#13;
  discourage both domestic and foreign investment, as the playing field will be leveled, compared&#13;
  to the current system in which incumbent firms are treated as â&#128;&#156;infantsâ&#128;&#157; with unfair incentives.&#13;
&#13;
  42.	    Taken together, the administrationâ&#128;&#153;s governance and structural reforms led to a&#13;
  significant acceleration of economic growth since 2010. However, it seems that the&#13;
  governance reformsâ&#128;&#148;the reduction of corruption, the increased transparency, and the higher&#13;
  and improved spending patternsâ&#128;&#148;contributed more to higher growth than the structural&#13;
  reforms per se, as many are awaiting concrete implementation and further reforms. A recent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  24&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
growth decomposition by the IMF54 suggests that the unexplained part of the growthâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
growth increase which cannot be explained by the growth of capital and laborâ&#128;&#148;was the most&#13;
important contributor to growth. As it is unlikely that a sudden improvement in technology&#13;
adoptionâ&#128;&#148;the usual explanation for the unexplained partâ&#128;&#148;occurred across the economy,&#13;
improved governance would be a strong candidate to explain the growth acceleration.&#13;
&#13;
43.	     The reforms are also beginning to translate into more and better job creation and&#13;
faster poverty reduction. As discussed above, but worth repeating, the 2013 Annual Poverty&#13;
Indicator Survey (APIS) suggests that poverty fell strongly between 2012 and 2013. The 2013&#13;
data also suggest that real income of the bottom 20 percent grew much faster than the rest of&#13;
the population, through a substantial 30 percent growth of domestic cash transfers to this&#13;
quintile versus four percent for the rest of the populationâ&#128;&#148;confirming that the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
CCT program is well-targeted and reaching the poor. Moreover, underemployment among the&#13;
poor significantly decreased in the same period. However, in 2014, the APIS data showed an&#13;
increase in poverty, attributed to Typhoon Yolanda (a one time, unprecedented event) and&#13;
artificially high rice prices (due to rice importation lags by the state monopoly), which offset the&#13;
income growth of the poor. Nonetheless, poverty reduction is expected to continue if the&#13;
country is able to maintain the speed and quality of growth achieved in recent years.&#13;
&#13;
44.	   The reforms undertaken by the Aquino Administration signal a break from the past.&#13;
What is now needed is to cement the gains in the last five years by institutionalizing the&#13;
reforms made and clearly laying out the unfinished reform agenda, which would address the&#13;
remaining structural issues that impede investment and thus the creation of more and better&#13;
jobs. These reforms, covering the areas of public finance, competition, property rights, and&#13;
business regulations, are well known and are discussed in depth in the Philippine development&#13;
report â&#128;&#156;Creating more and better jobs,â&#128;&#157;55 and in previous editions of the Philippine Economic&#13;
Update.56&#13;
&#13;
45.	   This closing discussion highlights the key recommendations that the administration&#13;
can consider as it ends its term:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Institutionalize current public sector reforms to increase budget transparency and&#13;
        accountability, and spending efficiency: The administrationâ&#128;&#153;s well known transparency&#13;
        and accountability reforms can be institutionalized by passing the Freedom of&#13;
        Information Bill. This would help institutionalize â&#128;&#156;open data,â&#128;&#157; which means making&#13;
        government data publicly available in user-friendly forms that can easily be analyzed&#13;

          (i.e., in Excel format as opposed to PDFs or images).57 Budget reporting reforms to allow&#13;
          the public and the government itself to track spending from appropriations to results on&#13;
          the ground can be institutionalized by adopting an automated and government-wide&#13;
          financial management and information system. These reforms can help the government&#13;
          fully utilize the growing fiscal space, which remains a challenge given limitations of the&#13;
          current public financial management system and the inclination of civil servants to still&#13;
          operate in the old mentality of rationalizing spending given severe cash constraints.58&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Craft a simpler, more equitable, and more efficient tax system to sustainably finance&#13;
          an investment-led growth:59 Following the passage of the landmark sin tax law, the&#13;
          following measures can be considered: i) rationalize tax incentives by making them&#13;
          more targeted, transparent, performance-based, and temporary, including timely&#13;
          release of a tax expenditure statement, which enumerates all existing and proposed tax&#13;
          incentives and who benefits from them, and ii) index tax rates and valuations which&#13;
          have not kept up with inflation, such as petroleum excise taxes and property valuations.&#13;
          Rapidly falling oil prices provide an opportunity to adjust petroleum excise taxes to&#13;
          make the tax system more equitable. Only if new revenues are raised should reforms to&#13;
          reduce tax rates be considered. These could include i) lowering the top marginal income&#13;
          tax rate to 25 percent, ii) reducing the gap between regular and special corporate&#13;
          income tax rates, and iii) simplifying the tax regime for micro and small enterprises. For&#13;
          tax policy to be effective, improved tax administration is necessary. Relaxing the bank&#13;
          secrecy law when fraud is detected would help improve tax administration significantly.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Further open up the economy to more competition by reducing the investment&#13;
          negative list:60 Following the passage of the competition policy law, proper formulation&#13;
          of its implementing rules and regulations is needed. Moreover, further opening up&#13;
          priority sectors of the economy to international players is recommended by removing&#13;
          them from the foreign investment negative list. The following sectors are likely to have&#13;
          the largest gains in terms of competition, capital, and technology: telecoms,61 shipping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  57&#13;
     Compared to the open data initiative, the FOI has a larger scope as it seeks to give the public easier access to a&#13;
  wide range of public documents, such as complete statement of assets, liabilities, and net worth of elected&#13;
  officials, government project documents, and minutes of official proceedings (e.g., congressional debates).&#13;
  58&#13;
     Using the 2014 budget as a frame of reference, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s analysis showed that failure to meet the&#13;
  disbursement goal was a result of structural weaknesses within key departments and agencies, which includes&#13;
  poor planning, and program and project design, procurement difficulties, including frequent bid failures and weak&#13;
  capacity to procure; and other bottlenecks including right-of-way-issues, difficulties in securing permits, and&#13;

     For instance, in its latest household download index, internet metrics provider Ookla (which owns the popular&#13;
  website speedtest.net), ranked the Philippines as 21st out of 22 countries in Asia in terms of average internet speed&#13;
  at 3.64 megabytes per second (mbps), behind Laos and Myanmar, and only ahead of Afghanistan. Comparing the&#13;
  Philippines to its neighbors, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s average internet speed is dwarfed by Thailand at almost 20 mbps, and&#13;

    â&#128;¢	 Secure property rights through land governance reforms: Following the near&#13;
       completion of the cadastral survey,62 and efforts to streamline land registration, the&#13;
       following reforms could be considered to address long standing issues in securing&#13;
       property rights: i) accelerate the systematic and administrative adjudication of property&#13;
       rights in rural and urban land, plot by plot, ii) adopt and strictly enforce zoning&#13;
       regulations in a systematic and consistent way, iii) implement the land reform program&#13;
       using a more community-driven and decentralized approach, and iv) improve land&#13;
       administration by passing an effective Land Administration Reform Act and National&#13;
       Land Use Act.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Overhaul business regulations to make them simpler and far less costly: The private&#13;
       sector is the main contributor and beneficiary of economic growth. In H1 2015, private&#13;
       domestic demand grew by 8.1 percent compared to an economy-wide growth of 5.3&#13;
       percent. The full potential of the private sector, in particular, small and micro firms, can&#13;
       be realized by re-engineering business regulations to make them simpler and far less&#13;
       costly. When sustained, these reforms can accelerate good job creation among micro&#13;
       and small firms and help eliminate extreme poverty by increasing their productivity and&#13;
       reducing informality. Being a major theme and recommendation of this report, the&#13;
       details are discussed in the medium-term reform section while the special focus looks&#13;
       in-depth at the total cost of starting and maintaining a business, and transaction costs&#13;
       in exportingâ&#128;&#148;two areas with great potential to create more and better jobs when&#13;
       reformed substantially.&#13;
&#13;
46.	     A number of these recommendations are currently being addressed. In his last state-&#13;
of-the-nation address (SONA) in July 2015, President Aquino asked congress to pass the 2016&#13;
General Appropriations Act on time, as is the practice in the last five budgets, so that i) there&#13;
would be no recurring funding for projects that are already completed, and ii) there would be&#13;
no delay in the delivery of public services. In addition to the economic reform bills, such as the&#13;
fiscal incentives rationalization bill, the president certified the passage of an anti-dynasty law as&#13;
urgentâ&#128;&#148;the first such high level directive to reform the countryâ&#128;&#153;s political system,63 and the&#13;

&#13;
even Vietnam at 18 mbps. As a reference, high-income economies like Singapore and Hong Kong both have&#13;
average internet speeds of over 100 mbps. More glaringly, despite being particularly slow, internet costs in the&#13;
Philippines are extremely expensive, costing around USD 18 per mbps against a global average of around USD 5&#13;
per mbps, as measured by Ookla.&#13;
62&#13;
   In 2015, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources reported that it completed field survey activities&#13;
for the cadastral survey. This covers over 30 million hectares in all of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s 1,634 cities and municipalities.&#13;
However, 118 cities and municipalities in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are still undergoing&#13;
inspection and verification.&#13;
63&#13;
    Research from the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center suggests that Philippine provinces with the&#13;
highest concentration of political dynasties also tend to have the highest poverty rates.&#13;
                                                                                                                    27&#13;

  Bangsamoro Basic Law, which is expected to help sustain peace in Mindanao. Outside the&#13;
  SONA, the President has expressed support in securing the revenue base by not supporting the&#13;
  lowering of tax rates without the appropriate offsetting measures.&#13;
&#13;
  47.	    To conclude, achieving inclusive growth is within reach, now more than in any&#13;
  previous period. The government now needs to maximize the chances that the country will&#13;
  follow a more inclusive growth path by accelerating reforms to secure property rights, promote&#13;
  more competition, and simplify regulations to trigger more private investments by firms of all&#13;
  sizes, while sustainably ramping up public investments in infrastructure, education, health, and&#13;
  social protection.&#13;

&#13;
            Simplifying business regulations to enhance inclusive growth64&#13;
&#13;
1.	    Complex Philippine business regulations are major hindrances to inclusive growth.&#13;
They limit the growth of innovative entrepreneurship, contribute to large scale informality, and&#13;
hence prevent the country from creating more and better jobs. To reduce poverty and share&#13;
the benefits of higher growth more broadly, reforms to simplify business regulations are&#13;
needed. Priority needs to be given to three major hindrances that affect the smallest businesses&#13;
the most: starting and maintaining a business, paying taxes, and accessing finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A complex set of business regulations&#13;
&#13;
2.	     Philippine business regulations are complex and among the costliest in East Asia,&#13;
undermining firmsâ&#128;&#153;, especially micro and small firmsâ&#128;&#153; ability to create jobs. Various measures&#13;
of competitiveness show a big room for improvement. The Doing Business 2015 report ranks&#13;
the Philippines at 95 among 189 economies in overall ease of doing business.65 Among major&#13;
economies in the ASEAN region, only Indonesia was ranked lower. For most indicators, the&#13;
Philippines ranks in the bottom half of the world (Table MT1). Firms find starting a business to&#13;
be among the costliest in the world, with a ranking of 161. Paying taxes and getting credit fare&#13;
better, but still at the low end of the spectrum at 127 and 104, respectively. All other indicators&#13;
except trading across borders and resolving insolvency, have rankings of 100 or higher (i.e.,&#13;
worse). In contrast, Malaysia and Thailand are among the easiest places to do business, with&#13;
overall rankings of 18 and 26, respectively. Indonesia, despite falling behind the Philippines in&#13;
recent Doing Business surveys, does a better job in protecting investors (ranked at 49 compared&#13;
to the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; 128). Even though the countryâ&#128;&#153;s ranking improved from the 72nd percentile in&#13;
2007 to the 50th percentile in 2015, there is still much room for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
Starting and maintaining a business&#13;
&#13;
3.	    Cumbersome regulations and procedures in starting and operating a business deter&#13;
new firm entry and business expansion, especially among micro and small firms. For example,&#13;
using available data, the number of procedures required to start a corporate business in the&#13;

  Philippines, at 16, is substantially higher than in other countries in the region.66 The average firm&#13;
  spends 34 days securing licenses required to start a business and spends around PHP 21,156&#13;
  for these (equivalent to 16.6 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s per capita income)â&#128;&#148;an amount very high&#13;
  relative to the micro firmâ&#128;&#153;s startup capital. Firms in the Philippines also have to apply for licenses&#13;
  annually, more often than in other countries (Figure MT1). Up to 18 licenses, permits, and forms&#13;
  have to be approved before a business can commence. In many cases, firms report that they&#13;
  need to pay bribes or give gifts to obtain various permits and government services (Figure MT2).&#13;

  employment purposes is also cumbersome. For instance, workers spend anywhere from a few&#13;
  hours to several days traveling and securing police or National Bureau of Investigation&#13;
  clearances, registering vehicles and getting driverâ&#128;&#153;s licenses,67 getting a community tax&#13;
  certificate, dealing with the Social Security System (SSS) (i.e., loans and retirement&#13;
  processing),68 and getting an â&#128;&#156;exit clearanceâ&#128;&#157; from the Philippine Overseas Employment&#13;

     In April 2015, reforms to reduce the cost of starting a business have been initiated. These reforms are currently&#13;
  being validated by the Doing Business team and will be released in the upcoming Doing Business report 2016.&#13;
  67&#13;
     In recent years, this process has worsened due to significant backlogs in new license plates and driversâ&#128;&#153; license&#13;
  production. After paying, applicants wait for several months before they can get their renewals.&#13;
  68&#13;
      In the case of SSS pension, pensioners must report annually to the SSS or their respective banks before pension&#13;
  benefits can continue. Failure to report means that pension is discontinued.&#13;

5.	     Finally, a weak bankruptcy resolution regime makes it particularly difficult for&#13;
inefficient or unprofitable firms to exit the market. A new insolvency law was recently passed,&#13;
bringing the recovery rate from an average of four cents to a dollar to an average of 21 cents to&#13;
a dollar. However, this is still quite low compared to 42 cents in Thailand and more than 80 cents&#13;
in Malaysia, causing potential firms to think twice before entering the market.&#13;
&#13;
Paying taxes&#13;
&#13;
6.	     Paying taxes is also cumbersome in the Philippines. According to the Doing Business&#13;
2015 report, the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; rank in paying taxes, which focuses on administrative complexities&#13;
of making various tax payments by enterprises, is among the worst in the ASEAN region and&#13;
globally ranks at 127 among 189 economies. This weak performance is largely attributed to the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s high total tax rate,69 equivalent to about 42.5 percent of profitâ&#128;&#148;the highest among&#13;
the three comparator countriesâ&#128;&#148;and the number of payments per year at 36, which is around&#13;
three times higher than that in Malaysia, around double compared to Thailand, and even five&#13;
payments more than that in Myanmar, the lowest overall ranked East Asian country. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

   The total tax rate measures the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions borne by the business in the&#13;
second year of operation, expressed as a share of commercial profit. The Doing Business 2015 reports the total tax&#13;
rate for calendar year 2013. The total amount of taxes borne is the sum of all the different taxes and contributions&#13;
payable after accounting for allowable deductions and exemptions. The taxes withheld (such as personal income&#13;
tax) or collected by the company and remitted to the tax authorities (such as value added tax, sales tax or goods&#13;
and service tax) but not borne by the company are excluded (source: Doing Business 2015).&#13;
                                                                                                                                                   31&#13;

  Philippines performed better only in the number of hours to comply with tax requirements70 at&#13;
  193 hours, compared to 264 in Thailand and 254 in Indonesia. In Malaysia, compliance takes only&#13;
  133 hours. However, these figures do not adequately measure the full compliance costs faced by&#13;
  Filipino taxpayers, given alleged systemic corruption in the tax system.&#13;
&#13;
  Accessing finance&#13;
&#13;
  7.	    Another key constraint to firm entry and expansion in the Philippines is limited access&#13;
  to finance. This issue weighs heavily on micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs),71&#13;
  preventing the majority of micro and small rural enterprises from growing. It is also a main&#13;
  obstacle to rural development. A large number of these enterprises are involved in adding value&#13;
  to primary crops but they are constrained by low-productivity technologies that hardly meet the&#13;
  emerging standards for quality and food safety required by the domestic market and foreign&#13;
  importers. Only about a fourth of these enterprises have access to reliable sources of credit such&#13;
  as rural banks, credit unions, cooperatives, and non-profit microfinance institutions. Because&#13;
  they often lack acceptable forms of collateral and transparent accounting practices, small rural&#13;
  enterprises are considered risky and are often turned down.&#13;
&#13;
  8.	     A 2007 study by the International Finance Corporation (IFC)72 suggests that the annual&#13;
  unmet demand for SME loans ranged from PHP 67 billion to PHP 180 billion. The government&#13;
  has tried to address this problem by imposing a minimum amount on bank lending to SMEs.&#13;
  However, instead of encouraging SME development, the requirement has led to re-labeling or&#13;
  re-categorizing of loans by banks, in order to comply with the requirement without venturing&#13;
  into new SME markets or taking new SME clients. This appears to be a common practice among&#13;
  banks in the Philippines.73&#13;
&#13;
  9.	     Limitations in bank regulation and supervision framework have also affected credit&#13;
  growth for SMEs. Lack of legal protections for bank supervisors and an inadequate bank&#13;
  resolution framework result in an overly conservative stance of the regulators in setting&#13;
  guidelines for credit operations. Addressing this issue would facilitate the shift toward a more&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  70&#13;
     The indicator on hours per year for paying taxes â&#128;&#156;measures the time taken to prepare, file, and pay three major&#13;
  types of taxes and contributions: the corporate income tax, value-added or sales tax, and labor taxes, including&#13;
  payroll taxes and social contributionsâ&#128;&#157; (Source: Doing Business 2015 report).&#13;
  71&#13;
     Updated Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas figures show that between 2008 and 2013, total nominal lending volume to&#13;
  MSMEs rose from PHP 311 billion to PHP 386 billion, accounting for just 12 percent of the net loan portfolio of the&#13;
  Philippine banking sector, and representing an average increase of only 4 percent per year. Moreover, according to&#13;
  the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) Asia Business Monitor Report (2009), access to funding is the second most&#13;
  important factor limiting the competitiveness of Philippine SMEs (as mentioned by 67 percent of respondents),&#13;
  next to lack of government support at 74 percent.&#13;
  72&#13;
     See Vaillancourt (2007) for more discussion.&#13;
  73&#13;
     Enforcement of mandatory lending targets relies on self-reporting and on the regulatorâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to supervise,&#13;
  which is usually overstretched. Moreover, lending to microfinance institutions also counts toward meeting the&#13;
  mandatory minimum SME target â&#128;&#148; a common loophole that results in little or no additional SME lending.&#13;

&#13;
risk-based approach to supervision and would lead to the development of a more dynamic&#13;
financial sector by enabling a more effective and less costly mechanism for weaker firms to exit.&#13;
&#13;
10.	     Access to credit is also hampered by a relatively high credit repayment risk. SME&#13;
access to loans is inversely related to the average time it takes to complete bankruptcy&#13;
proceedings and bankruptcy costs, and positively related to the expected creditor recovery rate&#13;
on bad loans. It is therefore unsurprising that the share of SMEs with bank loans (less than 10&#13;
percent74) is so low, considering that the bankruptcy process is extremely slow (i.e., it takes around&#13;
6 years to complete a bankruptcy case), bankruptcy administration costs are high (38 percent of&#13;
assets), and expected creditor recoveries are much lower at around four cents to a dollar, as&#13;
mentioned earlier. Moreover, bankruptcy procedures are so inefficient that creditors hardly ever&#13;
use it.75 These factors make SME financing a very risky exercise in the Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
11.	     The previous lack of accessible information on payment histories added further to&#13;
creditor risks. The ability of financial institutions to provide cost-effective services depends&#13;
largely on the availability of information necessary to assess the creditworthiness of their&#13;
clients. The scope, accessibility, and quality of credit information through public or private&#13;
bureaus in the Philippines are very low. Through Republic Act 9510, also known as the â&#128;&#156;Credit&#13;
Information System Act,â&#128;&#157; a centralized credit bureau, the Credit Information Corporation, was&#13;
finally created in 2015 after much delay. However, its effectiveness has yet to be proven, partly&#13;
because of its age.&#13;
&#13;
12.	    Moreover, the land registration and titling system is fragmented into different&#13;
registries, making debtor searches and financing difficult, and property rights insecure. The&#13;
current system for registering land titles is inadequate. The data are not centrally filed and are&#13;
not available online. The absence of reliable cadastral surveys until this year leaves large tracts&#13;
of land without enforceable titles. Uncertainties surrounding land ownership in rural areas&#13;
brought about by delays in the agrarian reform program and restrictions on the transfer of land&#13;
further discourage investments in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
13.	     Finally, significant deficiencies also abound in the registration of moveable collateral&#13;
(i.e., chattel). This is often the only type of collateral available to small and medium-size&#13;
enterprises. Information in the various Registry of Deeds offices is not centralized, registration&#13;
of chattel is often extremely time-consuming and costly, and financial institutions often cannot&#13;
verify if a particular chattel is registered.&#13;

  Informality and weak entrepreneurship as consequence&#13;
&#13;
  Large-scale informality&#13;
&#13;
  14.	    Informality is one of the major consequences of costly business regulations. The&#13;
  informal services sector has become the dominant source of employment for the majority of&#13;
  Filipinos who cannot find work in formal services and manufacturing. While not all of informal&#13;
  services are equivalent to bad jobs, its correlation to poverty and vulnerability is high and there&#13;
  are strong indications that the majority of informal services workers do not have the opportunity&#13;
  to move up the job ladder. Many end up in informal and subsistence micro-enterprises with no&#13;
  plans to grow, innovate, and create jobs.&#13;
&#13;
  15.	   The Philippine labor market is characterized by high levels of informality. Around 75&#13;
  percent of Filipino workers are informally employed.76 Informal workers are operationally&#13;
  defined to include all self-employed workers (not including employers), unpaid family workers,&#13;
  and wage workers with no written contract, social insurance, or protection from dismissal using&#13;
  the 2008 Informal Sector Survey (ISS)77 of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The PSA and&#13;
  the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) estimate that around 90 percent of Filipinos work&#13;
  in micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSME)78 or on own-account, and more than 60&#13;
  percent are found in the informal sector.79 According to the ISS, around 70 percent of self-&#13;
  employed workers are not registered with any government authority. A majority of their&#13;
  workers are working under informal arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
  16.	     In the past 15 years, the share of vulnerable workers, which include own-account and&#13;
  unpaid family workers â&#128;&#148; an indicator of informality â&#128;&#148; have decreased but their magnitude is&#13;
  still high. Wage and salaried workers accounted for about 57 percent of total employment in&#13;
  2012, 6 percentage points higher than in 1997 (Figure MT3). Three fast-growing industries&#13;
  contributed to this growth: BPO, electronics, and tourism. The remaining 43 percent are either&#13;
  own-account (32 percent) or unpaid workers in family micro-enterprises (11 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  76&#13;
     This estimate is not far from the estimate of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines, which put the&#13;
  number of informal workers at 77 percent of total employment (Ortiz-Luis 2008).&#13;
  77&#13;
     The ISS largely follows the recommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO) 15th and 17th&#13;
  International Conferences of Labor Statisticians (ICLS). They recommend the following criteria for informal&#13;
  enterprises: i) non-registration of enterprise, ii) small employment size, and iii) non-registration of employees of&#13;
  the enterprise. On the other hand, it recommends two criteria for informal employment: i) workers in informal&#13;
  sector enterprises and households and ii) contributing family workers in formal sector enterprises.&#13;
  78&#13;
     Following government definitions, micro firms are firms with fewer than 10 employees, small firms are firms&#13;
  with 10 to 99 employees, medium firms are firms with 100 to 199 employees, and large firms are firms with 200 or&#13;
  more employees.&#13;
  79&#13;
     The informal sector is broadly defined to include enterprises that fall outside the purview of government&#13;
  regulations. Operationally, the informal sector includes the agriculture and informal services sectors. The informal&#13;
  services sector is operationally defined to include the following subsectors: i) wholesale and retail trade, and ii)&#13;
  transportation, communication, and storage (TCS).&#13;

17.	    Vulnerable workers are susceptible to job or income losses. While non-wage work does&#13;
not necessary mean a bad job, it is less desirable in most cases because workers in this category&#13;
are less likely to have formal work arrangements, access to benefits and social security, and&#13;
protection from income shocks or job losses. In fact, vulnerable employment is widespread in&#13;
the agriculture and services sectors (Table MT2), and is highly correlated with poverty incidence&#13;
(Figure MT4).&#13;

receive adequate protection from the Labor Code. The Labor Code de facto protects only about&#13;

  a third of wage workers. The majority of wage earners face a high degree of income insecurity&#13;
  and a low degree of social protection (Table MT3). Data from the ISS show that 63 percent of&#13;
  workers in 2008 had no written contracts and 62 percent had no social insurances. Such&#13;
  attributes significantly increase the probability that workers are subjected to labor abuse. They&#13;
  also expose workers to sudden income shocks when they lose their jobs. Protection from and&#13;
  compensation for dismissal are also limited. Almost 60 percent of wage workers reported&#13;
  that they can be terminated without advance notice, and an even larger share of workers (70&#13;
  percent) did not receive termination pay. Agricultural workers exhibit the highest degree of&#13;
  informality, with more than 90 percent of workers exposed to low protection and a high level of&#13;
  income insecurity. The level of informality is lower in industry and services but employment is&#13;
  still mostly informal in these sectors (64 and 52 percent, respectively).&#13;

  Weak entrepreneurship&#13;
&#13;
  19.	    Apart from large-scale informality of workers, the other major consequence of costly&#13;
  business regulation is the slow growth of entrepreneurship, which has resulted in limited job&#13;
  creation for the poor. This is evident in a number of indicators such as the small size of firms,&#13;
  lack of registration, necessity as main intention for starting a business, low productivity, and&#13;
  limited options.&#13;
&#13;
  20.	    A huge majority of Philippine firms are small and remain small over the years. Micro,&#13;
  small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) account for 99 percent of all enterprises in the&#13;
  Philippines,80 and a majority of workers are found in micro-enterprises.81 The 2009 Enterprise&#13;
  Survey (latest available survey),82 which covers registered firms, shows that after three years,&#13;

91 percent of small firms remained small and only one percent moved to the medium-size&#13;
category. The biggest movement was in the medium-size category, where 17 percent of firms&#13;
moved to the large-size category. However, a larger share reverted to the small-size category&#13;
(21 percent) (Table MT4). The lack of growth among micro and small firms has contributed to&#13;
the â&#128;&#156;missing middleâ&#128;&#157; phenomenon in the Philippines.&#13;

21.	    The number of registered MSMEs is very low. A comparison between the Global&#13;
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) survey83 and the World Development Indicators (WDI) of the&#13;
World Bank on the number of newly registered enterprises suggests that a large number of&#13;
Philippine MSMEs are not registered. For instance, in 2014, 18.4 percent of GEM respondents in&#13;
the Philippines stated that they were either owners or the owner/manager of a new business,84&#13;
higher than in most other countries (Figure MT5). However, according to the data collected by&#13;
the WDI, in 2012, the density of newly registered firms is lower than in other countries at only&#13;
two registrations per 10,000 adults (Figure MT6).85&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
83&#13;
   GEM is an annual assessment of entrepreneurial activity. It is based on a survey conducted in over 85 countries&#13;
and covers around 2,000 adults per country. The GEM survey for the Philippines was last conducted in 2014 (see&#13;
http://www.gemconsortium.org/).&#13;
84&#13;
   In the GEM methodology, this is defined as the percent of the adult population who are either an entrepreneur&#13;
or owner-manager of a new business.&#13;
85&#13;
    These two statistics are not expected to match closely as new attempts to start a business are not always&#13;
successful. But for countries with low levels of informality, these 2 statistics are much closer. In Canada, for&#13;
example, six percent of respondents state that they are involved in a new business and business registrations are&#13;
at 75 per 10,000 adults. In countries with higher levels of informality, such as Indonesia and Thailand, the high&#13;
share of entrepreneurs is accompanied by lower new firm registration density.&#13;
                                                                                                               37&#13;

  22.	   The share of Filipinos involved in starting a business is one of the highest in the world,&#13;
  but new businesses are often started out of necessity, and while many introduce innovations,&#13;
  few intend to grow. According to the GEM survey, although 18.4 percent of Filipinos are&#13;
  involved in setting up or running a new business, about a third half of them cite necessity as the&#13;
  main reason, more often than in other countries (Figure MT7a). Though Filipino entrepreneurs&#13;
  are more likely to introduce a product or market innovation than in most other countries&#13;
  (Figure MT7b), they also do not expect to create more than five jobs in the next five years&#13;
  (Figure MT7c). While this showcases the creativity of Filipinos in spite of challenging market&#13;
  conditions and business regulations, these statistics indicate that a vast majority of new&#13;
  businesses are subsistence or stagnant in nature, reflecting the lack of jobs in the domestic economy.&#13;

23.	    The average productivity of MSMEs in the Philippines is very low. The labor&#13;
productivity of MSMEs in the Philippines is one-third that in Malaysia and one-twentieth those&#13;
in high-income countries (Figure MT8).86 Also, Philippine MSMEsâ&#128;&#153; contribution to GDP is small&#13;
compared to their share of employment. They account for 60 percent of establishment&#13;
employment but contribute only 36 percent of establishmentsâ&#128;&#153; gross value-added (Figure MT9).&#13;

  China, Indonesia, and Malaysia have higher rates of business creation in other sectors.&#13;
  Consequently, majority of jobs are also created in the retail trade sector in the form of sari-sari&#13;
  stores (i.e., informal retailing), street vending, and commission-based jobs, such as selling&#13;
  insurance or real estate.&#13;

  Reforms to simplify business regulations&#13;
&#13;
  25.	    Simplifying business regulations are needed to encourage the rapid growth of&#13;
  businesses of all sizes and encourage movement of small firms to the formal sector, and in&#13;
  the process create more and better jobs. The copious amount of red tape and convoluted&#13;
  procedures not only hinders investment and entrepreneurship, they also provide fertile ground&#13;
  for rent-seeking and corruption, which are detrimental to businesses of all sizes. Priority should&#13;
  be given to addressing three concerns in the Doing Business Report that affect micro and small&#13;
  enterprises the most: i) starting and maintaining a business, ii) paying taxes, and iii) accessing&#13;
  finance. This section discusses general reform directions while the special focus on doing&#13;
  business discusses these reforms in detail.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	   Simplify and automate key business registration and licensing processes to reduce 	                    	&#13;
       	    transaction costs&#13;
&#13;
  26.	    Starting a business can be simplified by harmonizing and streamlining procedures&#13;
  through a process re-engineering. The Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; business regulatory system currently&#13;
  requires 16 procedures to start a business. As a testament to this tedious process, firms are&#13;
  required by law to post in public view up to 18 different permits and licenses. To put the&#13;
  Philippines on par with other EAP countries, steps to register would need to be reduced from&#13;
  16 to 7. This reform could include i) harmonizing and streamlining procedures among national&#13;
  government agencies and LGUs to avoid overlaps and redundancies (e.g., harmonizing the city&#13;
  and barangay business permits into one permit), ii) removing steps that can be verified by&#13;
  government offices at the back end (the recent policy directive that no longer requires a Social&#13;
  Security System (SSS) clearance when renewing business permits is a good example87), and iii)&#13;
  reducing requirements whose purposes are not fully justified. The latter includes a) reducing or&#13;
  abolishing the paid-in minimum capital requirement, b) making the use of notaries and lawyers&#13;
  optional for company startups, c) moving toward a fixed registration fee that covers only&#13;
  administrative costs, and d) removing antiquated mandatory practices of having the Bureau of&#13;
  Internal Revenue (BIR) stamp the companyâ&#128;&#153;s invoice and account books. Some of these&#13;
  proposals would require a comprehensive review of all national and local laws, and their&#13;
  implementing rules and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  87&#13;
     Under the Joint Memorandum Circular No. 1 series of 2012 (December 2012) of SSS and the Department of&#13;
  Interior and Local Government, businesses no longer need to secure SSS clearance before renewing business&#13;
  permits. Instead, the SSS will transmit to the LGUs a list of delinquent employers. Businesses on the list will be&#13;
  barred from renewing their business permits.&#13;
  40&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.	    Automating and completely implementing the Philippine Business Registry (PBR) and&#13;
the Business Permit and Licensing System (BPLS) thorough the RS4LGU program (discussed in&#13;
special focus 1) are also needed. Automation and complete implementation of the PBR and the&#13;
BPLS would not only reduce the cost of doing business but also enhance transparency and&#13;
accountability across agencies and authorities involved, and eliminate opportunities for&#13;
corruption. Complete implementation of the PBR as the single online portal for processing all&#13;
national level registration and licensing requirements for sole proprietors should be given high&#13;
priority. This â&#128;&#156;one-stop shopâ&#128;&#157; system would significantly reduce transaction costs associated&#13;
with having to interact with various agencies, like the Business Permits and Licensing Office,&#13;
and the BIR. Implementation of the PBR would need to be followed by streamlining&#13;
registration, automating the BPLS, and rolling it out to all LGUs. To improve incentives for LGUs&#13;
to implement the BPLS, access of LGUs to the Performance Challenge Fund can be linked to&#13;
compliance with BPLS monitoring indicators.&#13;
&#13;
28.	    Greater transparency of business regulations can help improve understanding of the&#13;
registration, licensing, and taxation processes (especially among incipient firms) and help&#13;
reduce transaction costs. This can be done by mandating the prominent display of easy-to-&#13;
understand process flowcharts and service standards in all government offices. This would&#13;
involve creating a step-by-step guide, with a list of required documents and steps showing&#13;
which offices to visit, when to visit and with what documents, and listing the addresses,&#13;
working hours, and contact number of each office. A first step in this direction has been taken&#13;
with the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 (Republic Act 9485), which brought about the Citizenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Charter flowcharts now displayed in various government offices. This could be improved further&#13;
in terms of completeness, accuracy, and accessibility. Developing a more efficient online or&#13;
mobile registration system with no human intervention would be the next step in making&#13;
information more accessible and the system more transparent and accountable, saving&#13;
valuable time for both businesses and government officials. More importantly, reducing the&#13;
need for direct interaction with different officials would minimize the potential for under-the-&#13;
table transactions.&#13;
&#13;
29.	   The process for individuals seeking government licenses, permits, and clearances for&#13;
employment purposes also needs to be simplified. This includes simplifying procedures and&#13;
rationalizing fees in government offices such as the SSS, Land Transportation Office88, National&#13;
Bureau of Investigation, Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, and various city and&#13;
municipal offices, so that workers can spend less time queuing up to pay for and secure these&#13;
documents, and more time on their work. The current effort to have a one-stop shop for some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88&#13;
   For instance, renewing a driverâ&#128;&#153;s license requires paying the following fees: PHP 350 for processing fee, PHP 67&#13;
for computer fee, PHP 100 for change in address in some cases, PHP 100 for medical checkup, and PHP 50 for&#13;
computer fee for medical checkup, for a total of PHP 667. Reforms could include reducing fees for items that are&#13;
fully not justified (e.g., computer and change in address fees) and extending the validity of licenses from three to&#13;
five years, as is the practice in other countries.&#13;
                                                                                                                 41&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  of these government services in malls is welcome. Further improving this initiative, such as&#13;
  using online resources, would need to follow.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Simplify tax regime for micro and small taxpayers&#13;
&#13;
  30.	     Moving toward a simplified tax regime for micro and small businesses is warranted to&#13;
  reduce compliance costs and encourage movement of firms to the formal sector. The&#13;
  administrative complexity of complying with tax obligations is among the top complaints voiced&#13;
  by MSMEs and a frequent excuse for remaining in the informal sector. A simplified system&#13;
  could include i) using simplified tax forms, registration requirements, and payment processes,&#13;
  ii) mandating fewer requirements for bookkeeping and financial reporting, iii) integrating the&#13;
  tax filing and payment systems of the national and local government units so that taxpayers&#13;
  need to file and pay only once, and iv) combining the value-added tax (VAT), percentage tax,&#13;
  and income tax into a single business tax on turnover for micro and small enterprises.&#13;
  Reforming a very entrenched system with large bureaucratic interest will likely be a challenging&#13;
  endeavor. Resistance to reform can be mitigated by piloting the reform in a few agencies and&#13;
  LGUs, and then expanding it when public support has increased. By reducing compliance&#13;
  burden through a simplified tax regime, the government stands to raise more taxes and reduce&#13;
  corruption in the tax system, while also promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in the&#13;
  formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Facilitate greater access to finance, especially for micro and small enterprises&#13;
&#13;
  31.	    The public repository of credit information is now underway. Currently, there is no&#13;
  centralized comprehensive credit information system in the Philippines to house information&#13;
  on all borrowers of financial institutions. Financial sector groups within the banking industry&#13;
  have set up their own private credit bureaus. These credit bureaus are, however, mutually&#13;
  independent with limited capacity to share data across different banking groups and data are&#13;
  generally only for negative credit performance records. The fragmented nature of the credit&#13;
  information industry prevents lenders from obtaining reliable and complete credit history on&#13;
  existing and potential borrowers. In 2008, the â&#128;&#156;Credit Information System Actâ&#128;&#157; (Republic Act&#13;
  9510) was passed. The law created the Credit Information Corporation (CIC), whose purpose is&#13;
  to establish the comprehensive and centralized credit information system. This centralized&#13;
  repository of credit information will enable financial institutions to make more informed&#13;
  decisions in lending based on both positive and negative credit information. Development of&#13;
  the system is now underway. A pilot of the system is now being developed in a phased&#13;
  approach to be launched by June 2016.&#13;
&#13;
  32.	   The mandated system of lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) needs to be&#13;
  replaced by a system of credit guarantees. Mandatory bank allocations for SME lending may&#13;
  have played a role in encouraging growth in the volume of SME lending initially, but they no&#13;
  longer suffice to meet the financing needs of Philippine SMEs and have proven to be counter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  42&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
productive. A system of guarantees that seeks to encourage financial institutions to lend to&#13;
SMEs stands a better chance of succeeding than the current system that seeks to coerce the&#13;
banking system into making loans that are perceived to be unprofitable or overly risky.&#13;
&#13;
33.	    Strengthening the Philippine collateral system can improve access to finance. The&#13;
cadastral titling of all lands in the country needs to be completed and a central registry for&#13;
land titles established. This implies reforming the land administration procedures, which are&#13;
overly complex, centralized, and lengthy. There is a need to establish a modern, unified, and&#13;
easily accessible registration system. It would need to have searchable registries for all collateral&#13;
across registries.&#13;
&#13;
34.	    Increasing lending secured by non-real property or movable assets can further&#13;
improve access to finance. This entails i) improving the legal and regulatory framework for&#13;
secured transactions, ii) implementing a modern, centralized electronic registry for security&#13;
interests in movable assets, and iii) enhancing the capacities of local financial institutions in&#13;
lending based on movable assets. With better access to finance, more SMEs would grow and&#13;
create jobs.&#13;
&#13;
35.	     The role of cooperatives in accessing finance needs to be enhanced. Cooperatives&#13;
provide savings and credit services to over seven million members in the Philippines and can&#13;
play a crucial role in improving access of microenterprises and farmers, especially in poor and&#13;
remote communities, to financial services. Lack of adequate regulation and standards has often&#13;
led to poor financial performance of cooperatives. Credit and multipurpose cooperatives are&#13;
recognized as potentially important channels for reaching poor and remote areas with financial&#13;
services. Yet lack of adequate supervision, weak governance, poor financial management skills,&#13;
and a lack of necessary information and governance systems often contribute to the poor&#13;
performance or failure of cooperatives. Participation of cooperatives in providing access to&#13;
finance can be enhanced by i) improving the regulatory capacity of the Cooperative&#13;
Development Authority (CDA), ii) developing an effective apex structure to enhance financial&#13;
viability of cooperatives and widen their reach, and iii) amending the Financial Rehabilitation&#13;
and Insolvency Act to include cooperatives. Recent legal reforms provide a basis for improving&#13;
regulation of credit cooperatives and introducing clear performance standards. Implementing&#13;
adequate standards for governance, accounting, and financial management, and enforcing&#13;
these standards effectively are critical to the sustainable development of cooperatives.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 Ensure a coherent strategy for MSME development and measure impact of programs&#13;
&#13;
36.	   International experience shows that effective implementation is the key to ensuring&#13;
the success of strategies, plans, and programs for MSME development.89 The Philippines, like&#13;
&#13;
89&#13;
   The need to enhance growth in the MSME sector is recognized in the MSME Development Plan 2011-2016. The&#13;
plan sets a target for SME value-added contribution to GDP at 40 percent (from about 35 percent in 2008) and&#13;
increase in the number of SME jobs by two million. The plan addresses the key constraint areas and comprises four&#13;
pillars: i) business environment, ii) access to finance, iii) access to markets, and iv) productivity and efficiency. It&#13;
also covers crosscutting dimensions, including regional and local economic development, gender mainstreaming,&#13;
migration, and climate change.&#13;
                                                                                                                     43&#13;

  most other countries, has a wide range of MSME support programs being implemented by&#13;
  various departments and agencies.90 Improving coordination is an important first step in&#13;
  enhancing the effectiveness of the overall efforts to support SME development. This can be&#13;
  followed by improving the collection of program outcome data to allow the government to&#13;
  conduct evidence-based evaluation of programs to deliver maximum impact.&#13;

&#13;
                   The real cost of starting and maintaining a business91&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
1.	    Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs)92 are important contributors and&#13;
beneficiaries of economic growth. In 2012,93 MSMEs accounted for 99.6 percent of businesses&#13;
in the Philippines, comprised around 90 percent of total employment, and contributed 36&#13;
percent of total value-added (DTI 2014). Furthermore, 89 percent of MSME employees work in&#13;
micro and small businesses. Given these, creating an environment that helps MSMEs grow is&#13;
essential in advancing inclusive growth.&#13;
&#13;
2.	     However, business regulations have long been a cumbersome process in the&#13;
Philippines, posing obstacles to the development of MSMEs and hence job creation. While the&#13;
Philippines registered notable gains in its overall ranking in the 2015 Doing Business Report&#13;
(95th out of 189 countries, slightly below the 50th percentile), its ranking in the starting a&#13;
business indicator barely improved (Table 1.1).Â By comparison, in the East Asia region, Singapore&#13;
and Malaysia are among the easiest countries to start a business, with world rankings of 6 and&#13;
13, respectively. Similarly, MSMEs in the Philippines also find maintaining a business to be&#13;
costly. These have led to i) low registration rate, ii) necessity as a key reason for starting a&#13;
business, iii) stagnant business growth, iv) low productivity, and v) large scale informality&#13;
affecting over three quarters of the labor force (see the medium-term reform section for more&#13;
discussion).&#13;
&#13;
3.	   Of particular concern is the high overall cost imposed on MSMEs in starting and&#13;
maintaining a business. They not only have to pay for legitimate fees equivalent to 17 to 36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Analyst), Karl Kendrick Chua (Senior Country Economist), all from the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management&#13;
(MFM) Global Practice (GP), and Roberto Galang (Operations Officer), Beatrice Tanjangco (Research Assistant), and&#13;
Teresita Lacerna (Legal Adviser), with inputs from Jonathon Kirby (Consultant) and Marieta Patag (Consultant), all&#13;
from the Trade and Competitiveness (T&amp;C) GP. The team thanks Hans Shrader (Senior Operations Officer) and&#13;
Marianne Anderson (Results Measurement Specialist), both from T&amp;C, for reviewing the special focus, and to&#13;
officials of the Department of Trade and Industry, National Competitiveness Council, and the Quezon City Business&#13;
Permit Licensing Office and Communications Coordination Center for their comments.&#13;
92&#13;
   Republic Act 9501 defines MSMEs as businesses with assets not more than PHP 100 million or employment not&#13;
exceeding 199 employees. This is broken down into the following categories: i) micro businesses have assets not&#13;
exceeding PHP three million, or employs less than 10 workers, ii) small businesses have assets between PHP three&#13;
and 15 million, or employs 10 to 99 workers, and iii) medium businesses have assets between PHP 15 and 100&#13;
million, or employs 100 to 199 workers. The employment criteria takes precedence over the asset criteria in case&#13;
of double classification.&#13;
93&#13;
   2012 is the year with latest available data.&#13;
                                                                                                               45&#13;

&#13;
  percent of per capita income (PHP 21,000 to 45,00094), they also spend a considerable amount&#13;
  of time moving from one agency to another and waiting in line to process their documents,&#13;
  often resulting in significant loss of productive time and income. In some instances, businesses&#13;
  report that they need to pay bribes or give gifts to obtain various permits and government&#13;
  services. Simplifying and streamlining business registration process in the Philippines would&#13;
  therefore not only support job creation, but also improve transparency and accountability in&#13;
  the government.&#13;
&#13;
  4.	     To complement the discussion in the medium-term section, this special focus analyzes&#13;
  the direct and opportunity costs of starting and maintaining a business, and argues that&#13;
  reforms to reduce overall cost would free up substantial resources to make growth more&#13;
  inclusive. It begins with an overview of the procedures and direct cost in starting and&#13;
  maintaining a business, followed by an analysis of the opportunity costs, and ends with a&#13;
  discussion of current and recommended reforms to reduce the cost of business start-ups and&#13;
  maintenance.&#13;

  Direct costs&#13;
&#13;
  5.	     In the Philippines, the complexity of starting a business reflects the decentralized&#13;
  manner of securing various permits and licenses. An entrepreneur needs to visit the local&#13;
  government (and its various offices), five other national government agencies, and several&#13;
  private offices (e.g., bank, bookstore, print shop, notary) to secure various licenses, permits,&#13;
  and forms before his business can commence. To maintain a business, he has to update all&#13;
  clearances required during start-up, as well as a zoning permit. There are variations in the&#13;
  required steps and corresponding cost depending on the type of business (i.e., corporation or&#13;
  sole proprietor) and the local government unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  94&#13;
     As a point of comparison, PHP 19,000 is the average monthly income of a worker in the 9th income decile and&#13;
  monthly minimum wage is in Metro Manila is around PHP 12,000.&#13;
  95&#13;
     The per capita income used in the respective reference years are: PHP 60,528 for 2005, PHP 87,582 for 2010,&#13;
  and PHP 127,438 for 2015.&#13;

   Quezon City is largest city in terms of population and is consequently used as the benchmark in the Doing&#13;
Business Report.&#13;
97&#13;
   According to the Quezon City Business Permit Licensing Office, this step has ceased to be a separate step since&#13;
2012. For the past three years, business registration applicants were not required to present the CTC when they&#13;
register their business. The fee of PHP 500 is simply included in the one-time assessment of all fees and charges.&#13;
98&#13;
   Before a business permit is issued, the applicant must secure several clearances such as engineering, fire safety,&#13;
and sanitation. Under the regulatory simplification program (discussed in Box 1.2), the time needed to complete&#13;
LGU-managed processes were reduced to one day by moving requirement to post-licensing.&#13;
99&#13;
   According to the Quezon City Business Permit Licensing Office, the cost depends on the declared capitalization of&#13;
the business. The smallest fee is PHP 2,400.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                     47&#13;

  7.	      Sole proprietors follow a slightly different track, which has been simplified in recent&#13;
  years.100 The general steps and direct cost for Quezon City are outlined in Table 1.3. In 2010, the&#13;
  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) launched the Philippine Business Registry (PBR) in Quezon&#13;
  City.101 The PBR is an online registration platform for sole proprietors that covers registering a&#13;
  business name, obtaining a TIN, and registering with SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG. By merging&#13;
  several steps, step 1 can, in theory, be completed in just one day. In practice, however, system&#13;
  delays, can lead to more days. At the local level, step three has become easier with the Business&#13;
  One Stop Shop (BOSS) that allows minimally regulated businesses to obtain their local permits&#13;
  within the day.&#13;

8.	     After a business commences, numerous annual regulatory requirements are needed&#13;
to maintain the business, which can take several days to fulfill.103 The primary step is the&#13;
annual renewal of the mayorâ&#128;&#153;s business permit. Renewal of the mayorâ&#128;&#153;s business permit&#13;
necessitates renewing the same permits and clearances required the year before as well as&#13;
payment of business taxes based on gross sales. Permits vary depending on business type,&#13;
and include the fire safety inspection certificate from the Bureau of Fire Protection, a sanitary&#13;
permit from the City Health Department, and a certificate of electrical inspection from the Local&#13;
Building Official.104 These are provided by different local government offices and require time&#13;
and effort given the bureaucracy. After the business owner complies with the requirements,&#13;
documentary proof of gross sales such as audited financial statements and VAT payments must&#13;
be presented and assessed. While these requirements may serve important purposes, they&#13;
appear to be cumbersome, considering that businesses in the Philippines need to apply for&#13;
licenses more often than in neighboring countries (for instance, see Figure MT1 in the medium-&#13;
term reform agenda section).&#13;
&#13;
9.	    Moreover, there are tax and contribution payments that have to be paid frequently&#13;
within the year. For instance, for a corporation, there are 36 regular tax and contribution&#13;
payments needed every year (some required monthly and some quarterly), which takes 193&#13;
hours to comply with (Table 1.4). As the online system is not always functional, payments have to&#13;
be made in person in some cases.&#13;

10.	  These tax and contribution requirements make no concession to business size. Micro&#13;
and small firms face very high cost of compliance as the same tax regime is applied to them&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
103&#13;
    The process of business permit renewal varies depending on the LGU. Quezon City was used as a reference to&#13;
remain consistent with the Doing Business Report.&#13;
104&#13;
    For example, a law office would only need a fire inspection certificate, but a carinderia (small eatery) will also&#13;
need a sanitary inspection, and a drugstore/clinic would need to present a certificate from the Department of&#13;
Health.&#13;
                                                                                                                   49&#13;

  without regard to business size or their capacity to comply (e.g., they often do not have the&#13;
  resources to employ accountants or to maintain full accounts required by the tax agency). This&#13;
  deters many of them from entering or staying in the formal sector. In fact, it may be easier to&#13;
  leave the system completely than to comply without sufficient knowledge of the law and be&#13;
  subjected to audits and penalties. Moreover, maintaining a formal status can be much more&#13;
  expensive than the original cost of business registration.&#13;

  maintaining a business. While the peso value is difficult to determine given the clandestine&#13;
  nature of these transactions, the significant number of businesses reporting the need to pay&#13;
  bribes or give gifts suggest that the practice may be systemic in some agencies. For instance, in&#13;
  the 2009 Enterprise Survey, around 11, 8, and 25 percent of small, medium, and large firms,&#13;
  respectively, reported paying bribes or giving gifts to obtain an operating license (see Figure&#13;
  MT2 in the medium-term reform section). The results are even worse for securing a&#13;
  construction permit and getting an electricity connection. A more recent survey by the Social&#13;
  Weather Stations (SWS) in 2015 confirms earlier results. It finds that 25 percent of firms paid&#13;
  bribes in order to obtain a local license, while 21 percent paid bribes in order to obtain a&#13;
  national license.&#13;
&#13;
  12.	   More importantly, considerable opportunity cost arises from missing productive days&#13;
  of work, and thus lost income, in order to comply with government requirements. For most&#13;
  micro or small businesses, the owner himself has to personally travel from one government&#13;
  agency to another and fall in long lines instead of doing more productive work.105 These lost&#13;
  productive days lead to lost income. If an agent or worker is deputized, that typically comes at a&#13;
  high cost relative to the businessâ&#128;&#153;s capitalization. Estimating the impact of lost productive days&#13;
  on income is subject to a number of assumptions and considerations, and thus also not easy to&#13;
  measure, but indicative estimates show that this can also be very large.&#13;
&#13;
  13.	   Using parameters from the previous section, total opportunity cost from productive&#13;
  days lost can easily reach more than PHP 100 billion annually.106 The following gives the&#13;
  breakdown: For businesses, this comes from lost income opportunities (by PHP 11.9 billion). For&#13;
  the government, this comes from lost tax and contribution revenues due to lower income (by&#13;
  PHP 9.7 billion). Finally, for the economy, it manifests in lower aggregate spending (by PHP&#13;
  133.8 billion). Table 1.5 summarizes these opportunity costs while Box 1.1 explains the&#13;
  (conservative) methodology used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  105&#13;
      Transacting with a government agency does not usually take eight full hours, but considering the worsening&#13;
  traffic condition, time spent travelling from one agency to another can easily take the whole day.&#13;
  106&#13;
      Understandably, the bulk of the opportunity cost comes from maintaining a business, given the requirement to&#13;
  renew and pay annually (or more frequently). However, if all the opportunity costs in starting a business since the&#13;
  beginning are added up, this can easily rival the opportunity cost of maintaining a business.&#13;
  50&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.	     Moreover, opportunity cost can also arise from discouraged Filipinos who could have&#13;
started a business if only the cost was reasonable. While this type of opportunity cost is more&#13;
difficult to measure, it nevertheless is not hard to grasp. For instance, households receiving&#13;
substantial remittances of at least PHP 200,000 per year and have a working age member who&#13;
is not employed (i.e., unemployed or out of the labor force) could better use this money to start&#13;
a business,107 yet many donâ&#128;&#153;t. The 2012 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) estimates&#13;
that 117,782 households fit this description, with average annual remittances of PHP 374,000.&#13;
However, due to income underreporting, actual remittances received may be closer to PHP&#13;
602,140.108 In the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s survey of overseas Filipino worker (OFW) households, in the&#13;
past five years, only 6.5 percent of households reported that they use remittances for&#13;
investments, while 42 percent use the remittances for savings. The difference of 35.5 percent109&#13;
may represent the untapped potential investors, of which around half are assume to be risk-&#13;
neutral and thus will invest. Assuming that these households invest the entire remittance&#13;
amount,110 this gives rise to forgone investment of around PHP 12.6 billion. At a return of&#13;
investment of 15 percent, this translates into forgone annual income of PHP 1.9 billion and&#13;
forgone tax revenues of around PHP 1.5 billion. Finally, taking the economy-wide multiplier of&#13;
1.8, the impact on the economy is PHP 21.2 billion. And if each business creates two jobs in&#13;
addition to the owner, then total job generation would be 62,179, or about five percent of the&#13;
number of entrants to the labor force every year. This is a significant number of jobs forgone.&#13;
&#13;
15.	    These indicative estimates suggest that high cost of doing business is clearly a toll on&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s inclusive growth agenda. When taking all other Doing Business indicators into&#13;
account (e.g., securing construction permit, getting electricity, trading externally), the overall&#13;
cost of doing business, both direct cost and opportunity cost, could be several times higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
107&#13;
    This analysis considers only remittance-receiving households as a potential source of new businesses. It uses&#13;
remittances from the household surveys, which are lower than the remittances reported by the central bank. This&#13;
means that the estimates are conservative estimates, even when risk aversion is considered (i.e., some households&#13;
will not start a business because they are simply risk averse).&#13;
108&#13;
    FIES income components, including remittances, suffer from significant underreporting, thus they need to be&#13;
adjusted. A simple way to adjust FIES remittance is to raise it by the ratio of total BOP cash remittances to FIES&#13;
remittance. Since BOP cash remittance was around PHP 903.7 billion and FIES remittance was PHP 560.2, the ratio&#13;
is around 1.61.&#13;
109&#13;
    This may represent the ceiling of remittance receiving households who could have invested, as investing&#13;
involves risk, and not all households have a high risk appetite.&#13;
110&#13;
    This assumption is reasonable as these households belong to the top two percent of the income percentile with&#13;
a marginal propensity to consume of 0.68, much lower than the national average of 0.83.&#13;
                                                                                                               51&#13;

                                                 productive days and discouraged potential investors&#13;
&#13;
  To estimate the opportunity cost in starting a business, a proxy for income is multiplied by the number&#13;
  of days spent in complying with various government requirements and the number of new businesses&#13;
  that enter the market annually. To be conservative, the minimum wage rate of the National Capital&#13;
  Region is used as a proxy for net income. The number of new businesses that enter the market annually&#13;
  is extrapolated from the Department of Trade and Industryâ&#128;&#153;s annual estimate of MSMEs for 2008 and&#13;
  2012. In 2008 and 2012, respectively, DTI estimated around 758,436 and 940,802 MSMEs. These&#13;
  numbers represent an average annual entry of 45,592 MSMEs into the market. This is further broken&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  111&#13;
      This is computed as (34 days x PHP 481 per day x 4,559 new corporations) + (3 days x PHP 481 per day x 41,033&#13;
  new sole proprietors). The addends are PHP 74.6 million and PHP 59.2 million.&#13;
  112&#13;
      This is computed as (PHP 133.8 million x 42.5 percent_ + (PHP 969.34 million x 5.36 percent) [the effective VAT rate&#13;
  on sales assuming 50 percent is exempt]. Revenues are computed from profit using the following profit to cost ratio:&#13;
  13.8 to 86.2. The addends are PHP 56.87 million and PHP 51.96 million.&#13;
  113&#13;
      This is computed as PHP 835.57 million x 1.8 (the economy-wide multiplier).&#13;
  114&#13;
      This is computed as 26 days x PHP 481 per day x 940,802 existing MSMEs. 26 days is derived from 193 hours&#13;
  required to pay taxes plus an estimated two days to renew licenses.&#13;
  115&#13;
      This is computed as (PHP 11.77 billion x 42.5 percent) + (PHP 85.26 billion x 5.36 percent). The addends are PHP&#13;
  5 billion and PHP 4.57 billion.&#13;
  116&#13;
      This is computed as PHP 73.49 billion x 1.8.&#13;
  117&#13;
      This is computed as 117,782 households x adjusted average remittance of PHP 602,140 x half of the 35.5&#13;
  percent OFW households who are risk neutral and could have invested.&#13;
  118&#13;
      This is computed as PHP 12.59 billion x 15 percent return on investment.&#13;
  119&#13;
      This is computed as (PHP 1.89 billion x 42.5 percent) + (PHP 13.68 billion x 5.36 percent). The addends are PHP&#13;
  0.81 billion and PHP 0.73 billion.&#13;
  120&#13;
      This is computed as PHP 11.79 billion x 1.8.&#13;

&#13;
down into an estimated 4,559 (10 percent) corporations and 41,033 (90 percent) sole proprietors. To&#13;
estimate the opportunity cost for existing businesses, the DTI estimate of MSME stock as of 2012 is used&#13;
as the proxy. These parameters are lower bound and thus give a conservative estimate of opportunity&#13;
cost.&#13;
&#13;
To estimate the impact on government tax and contribution revenues, lost income is multiplied by the&#13;
average tax and contribution rate of 42.5 percent of profit, taken from the Doing Business Report. In&#13;
addition, the VAT rate of 12 percent is applied to the derived business sales. To be conservative, it is&#13;
assumed that 50 percent of cost is non-VATable. Finally, the profit and cost share of 13.8 and 86.2,&#13;
respectively, is based on the economy-wide average from the Census of Philippine Business and&#13;
Industry.&#13;
&#13;
To estimate the impact on aggregate spending (and hence GDP), total business cost is multiplied by the&#13;
average economy-wide multiplier of 1.8, sourced from the 2006 input-output table.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there are many ways to estimate forgone investment due to high cost of entry. One method is&#13;
to scan the household survey for households receiving substantial remittances and have at least one&#13;
member outside the labor force who could start a business using the remittances. Supplemented with&#13;
the BSPâ&#128;&#153;s survey on the use of OFW remittances, the number of untapped households can be estimated.&#13;
Details are discussed in the main text.&#13;

&#13;
Reforms to reduce the cost of starting and maintaining a business&#13;
&#13;
16.	    Recognizing the adverse impact on the economy of costly business start-up, the&#13;
government has begun to address a number of doing business constraints. At the national&#13;
level, four landmark memoranda of agreement (MOAs) were signed by nine national&#13;
government agencies and a local government unit on April 14, 2015.121 This major collaboration&#13;
among several government agencies is a response to the complexity created by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
decentralized manner of starting a business. If implemented fully, the number of days needed&#13;
to start a corporate business in Quezon City is expected to fall from 34 to 8 and the number of&#13;
steps from 16 to 6. Successful implementation can then be rolled-out in other areas.&#13;
&#13;
17.	   The new process in registering a corporation involves a re-engineering of existing&#13;
processes and the creation of an integrated business registration system. Many steps from&#13;
the previous regime are either eliminated or merged to reduce the number of steps and days&#13;
needed (Figure 1.1). Among the steps retained are the preparation of supporting documents,&#13;
securing a barangay clearance, and obtaining the business permit from the Business Permits&#13;
and Licensing Office (BPLO). Steps removed or merged are i) bank deposit of paid in capital, ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
121&#13;
   These agencies are: National Competitiveness Council (NCC), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of&#13;
Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Securities and Exchange&#13;
Commission (SEC), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Social Security System (SSS), Home Development Mutual&#13;
Fund (Pag-IBIG), Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and the local government of Quezon City.&#13;
                                                                                                            53&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  purchase of special books of accounts, and iii) individually registering with a) SSS, b) PhilHealth,&#13;
  and c) Pag-Ibig. These former requirements are removed as SEC adopts an integrated business&#13;
  registration system similar to PBR, which will create a unified registration system for SEC, SSS,&#13;
  PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG registrations and for obtaining a TIN from BIR. Furthermore, efficiency&#13;
  are being introduced at the LGU level by reducing the average processing time for obtaining a&#13;
  business permit to operate from six days to around two to three days, including the step to pay&#13;
  the annual community tax and payment of necessary fees. BIR is also enhancing its system by&#13;
  combining the process of securing a certificate of registration and the registration of book of&#13;
  accounts into one. Likewise, acquiring authority to print and printing receipts/invoices are being&#13;
  simplified.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.	     If fully implemented, this reform can also result in time and cost savings. For each day&#13;
of reduction, at least PHP 2 million in lost income can be saved. Moreover, PHP 68 million in&#13;
lost income can be saved if the 2015-2016 goal of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC)&#13;
to reduce business start-up to three steps and three days is achieved. While these appear small,&#13;
its second round effects on the economy can be substantial. Furthermore, another PHP 9 billion&#13;
in lost income can be saved annually if the days spent to pay taxes is reduced to 13 payments&#13;
and 36 hours. In addition to these savings, gains to the economy can come from new business&#13;
entry (e.g., 24 percent spike in registration rate when procedures were simplified in the key&#13;
cities of Manila, Quezon, Marikina, and Mandaluyong) as a result of faster, easier, and more&#13;
transparent registration process and business regulations.&#13;
&#13;
19.	    At the local level, 25 cities122 have also taken initiatives to reduce business start-up&#13;
costs. In the Philippines, cities, municipalities, and barangays (villages) play a big role in&#13;
the business registration process. In fact, about one-third of the registration steps are in the&#13;
domain of the local government. To support business entry reform at the city level, the&#13;
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) initiated a program called RS4LGU&#13;
(Regulatory Simplification for LGUs) that support cities to reform their business registration&#13;
systems (see Box 1.2). Since 2010, 25 cities have passed executive orders (EOs) codifying&#13;
reforms to simplify their respective business permit licensing systems. Cities that have passed&#13;
EOs reduced registration steps from an average of 45 to 3 and registration days from an&#13;
average of 30 to 1. More successes are expected to follow as DILG rolls out the program to&#13;
other LGUs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Box 1.2. Regulatory simplification program for business permit renewal in the Philippines&#13;
&#13;
Initiated in 2008, the regulatory simplification program targeted and removed system inefficiencies,&#13;
and regulatory redundancies to make starting a business easier.123 The regulatory simplification&#13;
program aimed to i) help local governments units (LGUs) lower administrative barriers, and ii) reduce&#13;
transaction costs for opening a business in terms of time, cost, and procedures. The program used a&#13;
bottom-up approach to involve LGUs in the reform. A diagnostic tool developed by the International&#13;
Finance Corporation (IFC) was used to help cities methodically analyze and target steps for elimination&#13;
in business registration. A legal analysis guidance tool was created to help them determine which&#13;
licensing steps can be eliminated or moved. It also helped cities realize that several steps could be&#13;
deferred to post-licensing, such as a firmâ&#128;&#153;s enrollment with social security agencies and securing a fire&#13;
permit. This made a two-step and one-day business permit process for LGU-controlled procedures&#13;
possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
122&#13;
    The cities that have started reforms to reduce business start-up costs are the following: in Luzon: Urdaneta,&#13;
Kabugao, San Fernando, Santiago, Cauayan, La Trinidad, Legazpi, Tabuk, Baguio, Laoag, Tanauan, Vigan, Ilagan, and&#13;
Kawit; in Visayas: Bogo, Calbayog, Catbalogan, Tacloban, Ormoc, Danao, and Lapu-lapu; and in Mindanao: Surigao,&#13;
Tacurong, Samal, and Tagum.&#13;
123&#13;
    The program was supported by the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group.&#13;
                                                                                                              55&#13;
&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The success of four pilot cities in Metro Manila caught the national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s attention and&#13;
  generated interest for its roll out in other LGUs. The project began in Quezon City, Marikina City,&#13;
  Mandaluyong City, and Manila City in 2009. The time to complete business entry in the four cities was&#13;
  reduced from an average of 13 days to just 1. In the succeeding years, the project was expanded to&#13;
  Tuguegarao City, Puerto Princesa City, and Pasig City. During the final 1.5 years of the project, 15 more&#13;
  cities adopted the program as the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) formally took&#13;
  ownership of the program and hired its own coaches to replicate the earlier successes of the reform. A&#13;
  particularly successful LGU is La Trinidad in Benguet Province.&#13;
&#13;
  Business registration requirements in La Trinidad were reduced significantly after the reform. La&#13;
  Trinidad officially adopted the regulatory simplification program in March 2014. Before introducing the&#13;
  program, registration required eight signatures and 18 steps, and took two to five days for the Business&#13;
  Permit Licensing Office (BPLO) to process an application. All in all, it took around 14 days to complete&#13;
  the 18 steps. After the program was implemented, registration was reduced to three signatures, three&#13;
  steps, and one hour for the office to process. The simplified three steps are i) unified submission of form&#13;
  and obtainment of barangay clearance, ii) one-time assessment and payment (previously multiple&#13;
  payments that went through various departments), and iii) release of permit. In addition, like other&#13;
  LGUs in the program, it adopted a unified form that further simplified the process.&#13;
&#13;
  As a result, the number of new registrants and renewals increased significantly in the first year of&#13;
  implementation and businesses benefited through annual cost savings. La Trinidad saw the number of&#13;
  new registrants and renewals increase from 5,568 in 2013 to 6,717 in 2014 (a 21 percent increase),&#13;
  driven by first time registrants. Moreover, businesses benefited from an estimated PHP 83 million in&#13;
  annual cost compliance savings (information derived from focus group discussion).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  20.	   While the above reforms are laudable and should make a significant impact, more can&#13;
  be done to unleash the full potential of MSMEs both as contributor and beneficiary of&#13;
  economic growth. The thematic recommendations to reduce the cost of doing business are&#13;
  discussed in the medium-term section on simplifying regulations. This concluding section&#13;
  discuss in detail those recommendations specifically pertaining to business startup and&#13;
  operations. The â&#128;&#156;Go Negosyo Actâ&#128;&#157; discussed in Box 1.3 is an important initiative that addresses&#13;
  some of these recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Further simplify and automate key business registration steps through process re-&#13;
            engineering such as i) harmonizing and streamlining remaining procedures among&#13;
            national government agencies and LGUs to avoid overlaps and redundancies, ii)&#13;
            removing steps that can be verified by government offices at the back end, and iii)&#13;
            reducing requirements whose purposes are not fully justified. Some of these would&#13;
            require a comprehensive review of all national and local laws, and their implementing&#13;
            rules and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 Fully implement the Philippine Business Registry (PBR) at the national level and the&#13;
            RS4LGU program at the local government level. The simplification of steps due to the&#13;
            PBR and the RS4LGU can help reduce transaction costs and enhance transparency and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       accountability across involved agencies. In addition, training personnel on implementing&#13;
       these rules effectively is needed to ensure adequate compliance.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Introduce alternative payment systems such as online and mobile payments. This&#13;
      would eliminate the need to visit government offices or local banks to complete the&#13;
      processing. This would also reduce the potential for under-the-table payment. Quezon&#13;
      City is expected to roll out an online payment system for business taxes by end-2015.&#13;
      Other LGUs can move to implement similar programs.&#13;

                Box 1.3. NEGOSYO centers: Easing the way for MSMEs to do business&#13;
&#13;
The 2014 â&#128;&#156;Go Negosyo Actâ&#128;&#157; is an important legislation that supports the stateâ&#128;&#153;s policy of fostering&#13;
broad-based growth of MSMEs. One provision of the act is the establishment of go negosyo centers by&#13;
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in several cities and municipalities to facilitate business&#13;
start-up and operations by MSMEs. DTI has allocated PHP 92.7 million to set up these centers, which are&#13;
mandated to promote ease of doing business by MSMEs through i) business registration assistance, ii)&#13;
business advisory services, iii) business information and advocacy, and iv) monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
business processes for MSMEs.&#13;
&#13;
Go negosyo centers serve as a support sharing facility and a one-stop shop for MSME services.&#13;
Through these centers, MSMEs can start and do business without going to different government&#13;
agencies, thereby bypassing lengthy and complex procedures. The centers assist in facilitating business&#13;
registration and providing assistance on compliance. Moreover, the centers also offer advisory services&#13;
on product development and investment promotion, as well as facilitate market linkages and access to&#13;
technology, financing, and management training. MSMEs also receive advice and assistance on how to&#13;
comply with these requirements.&#13;
&#13;
To date, 89 go negosyo centers have been established across the country and MSMEs have begun to&#13;
use their services. Around 29,615 MSMEs have availed of the centersâ&#128;&#153; services of which 46 percent&#13;
availed registration or renewal service, and 33 percent availed of business advisory services on product&#13;
development (4 percent), access to markets (5 percent), access to finance (5 percent), investment&#13;
promotion (3 percent), business management training (12 percent), and business information (25&#13;
percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Reduce the frequency of renewals of government licenses, permits, and clearances for&#13;
      employment purposes. For instance, licenses can be renewed every three years instead&#13;
      of yearly, and risk-based audits can be used by the government to check on compliance&#13;
      instead of subjecting the whole population to de facto audits every time they renew&#13;
      their licenses. Local business tax revenues can be maintained by increasing the tax to&#13;
      cover multiple years. At any rate, for the business, this is still reduced total cost given&#13;
      the time savings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     57&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Consider adopting a risk-based approach for business permitting purposes. The idea of&#13;
          risk based audits can be extended to licensing, permitting, and other regulatory&#13;
          requirements. Under this approach, instruments used for regulation and control will be&#13;
          based on the level of risk (see Box 1.4 for more discussion).&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢	 Simplify the tax regime for micro and small businesses to reduce compliance costs and&#13;
          encourage movement of firms to the formal sector. A simplified system could include i)&#13;
          using simplified tax forms, registration requirements, and payment processes, ii)&#13;
          mandating fewer requirements for bookkeeping and financial reporting, iii) integrating&#13;
          the tax filing and payment systems of the national and local government units so that&#13;
          taxpayers need to file and pay only once, and iv) combining the value-added tax (VAT),&#13;
          percentage tax, and income tax into a single business tax on turnover for micro and&#13;
          small enterprises, say at six percent of gross sales. By reducing compliance burden&#13;
          through a simplified tax regime, the government stands to raise more taxes and reduce&#13;
          corruption in the tax system, while also promoting entrepreneurship and job creation in&#13;
          the formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  Box 1.4. Introducing a risk-based approach to regulate business licensing&#13;
&#13;
  Adopting a risk-based approach can simplify key regulatory processes that govern business activities,&#13;
  thereby saving and allocating scarce resources. A risk-based approach involves moving from&#13;
  inspections, licensing, permitting, and other regulatory requirements that cover all businesses uniformly&#13;
  to an approach that tailors the instruments used for regulation and control based on the level of risk.&#13;
  The higher the potential risk posed by a specific business activity, the stricter the control and the greater&#13;
  the need for licensing or permitting and more frequent inspections. For low-risk activities, a license or&#13;
  permit should generally not be required, and inspections should be rare.&#13;
&#13;
  Risk matrices are the primary tool used to conduct risk classification. The format is relatively simple:&#13;
  one axis represents severity and the other probability. Regulatory responses (e.g., licensing, permitting)&#13;
  are adapted based on the matrix. Only parameters that are easily known about the business are&#13;
  included. If risk matrices are too long and complex, they become very difficult to use. A typical risk&#13;
  matrix would be less than one page, including at least the following factors (and possibly others that are&#13;
  country or regulator-specific):&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Sector of activity&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Type of process (if manufacturing, what products are involved and are hazardous substances&#13;
     used or stored?) or type of activity (if non-manufacturing, do people reside permanently and/or&#13;
     sleep in the facility?)&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Number of people present in the establishment during normal operation and/or maximum&#13;
     number of people that are present&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Location in the case of hazardous industrial facilities (surrounded or not by inhabited area or&#13;
     close to sensitive object from an environmental perspective, such as a water source)&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Specific aspects of the building, such as underground parts and/or high-rise (i.e., difficulties in&#13;
     evacuation)&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Specific hazardous machinery being used in the building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                      Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To sufficiently assess the likelihood of compliance in each establishment, an adequate information&#13;
system is needed by regulators. In most cases, the assessment of risks is based on prior records.&#13;
Efficiently using them requires a computerized system to make full use of risk matrices.&#13;
&#13;
Aggregate classifications of establishments can mitigate concerns about inadequate information.&#13;
Because of inadequate information, some preliminary division of establishments based on their inherent&#13;
characteristics (e.g., sector, size, and type of activity) is already a considerable improvement in terms of&#13;
risk management compared to treating all establishments as identical. Thus, governments that do not&#13;
have such information systems in place can start implementing risk-based approaches to classification&#13;
and planning.&#13;

                             Export transaction costs in the Philippines124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Introduction&#13;
&#13;
  1.	      Philippine merchandise exports have been steadily increasing, but at a slower pace&#13;
  compared with regional peers. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s exports have increased by 42 percent since&#13;
  2000,125 driven by increasing integration into the global electronic supply chain, increasing&#13;
  demand for other local products, such as agricultural produce, and positive effects of trade&#13;
  liberalization stemming from the 1993 ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. However, export growth&#13;
  of regional peers has been significantly higher. For instance, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s exports in the same&#13;
  period increased by 180 percent and Thailandâ&#128;&#153;s by more than 200 percent (Figure 2.1).&#13;
&#13;
  2.	     Philippine export performance has been uneven and is concentrated in a few firms,&#13;
  which are mostly large enterprises. The performance of Philippine exports relative to the world&#13;
  has alternating periods of robust growth in the mid-2000s, loss of market share during 2011-&#13;
  2012, and a return to growth afterwards. This volatility is expected but appears to be more&#13;
  pronounced compared to its neighbors like Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia (Figure 2.3). The&#13;
  countryâ&#128;&#153;s volatility in export shares has been largely driven by changes in global market trends&#13;
  for electronics, which represent around 50 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s total exports. Periods of&#13;
  strong growth have benefited a small segment of the economy as Philippine exports are&#13;
  concentrated in a few firms, estimated at between 1,420 and 3,579 companies, with only a few&#13;
  small and medium enterprises (SMEs).126&#13;
&#13;
  3.	   Less robust export growth may have slowed the pace of job creation. Since 2001,&#13;
  growth of the total wage bill in the export sector has been slower than that of the economy.&#13;
&#13;

      This special focus section was prepared by Justin Chan (Research Assistant), Joseph Louie Limkin (Research&#13;
  Analyst), Karl Kendrick Chua (Senior Country Economist), all from the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management&#13;
  Global Practice (GP), and Roberto Galang (Operations Officer), Marcin Piatkowski (Senior Financial Economist),&#13;
  Jean Francois Arvis (Senior Transport Economist), Daria Taglioni (Senior Trade Economist), Gerard McLinden (Lead&#13;
  Specialist), Christina Busch (Consultant), Claire Hollweg (Consultant), and Guillermo Arenas (Consultant), all from&#13;
  the Trade and Competitiveness GP. This special focus benefited from the Export Development Councilâ&#128;&#153;s (EDC) cost&#13;
  of exporting survey and interviews with i) EDC, ii) Royal Cargo, iii) current and former officials of the Bureau of&#13;
  Customs (BOC), iv) e-Konek Pilipinas, and v) Department of Trade and Industry. The Chamber of Customs Brokers&#13;
  was not available for interview despite repeated attempts. The report team is very grateful for their time, and in&#13;
  particular, to the EDC for sharing the survey results.&#13;
  125&#13;
      This is sourced from the World Development Indicatorsâ&#128;&#153; value of exports index, which is derived from the&#13;
  national income accounts.&#13;
  126&#13;
      The number of exporters varies across data sources: i) 1,420 exporters according to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas&#13;
  Directory of Philippine Merchandise Exporters 2012, ii) 1,284 PEZA-registered exporters as of January 31, 2014,&#13;
  and iii) 2,295 registered exporters in PhilExport (SMEs are likely to be counted in this list). The latter two are largely&#13;
  mutually exclusive.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                              Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, between 2001 and 2011, labor value-added of exports (both direct and indirect)&#13;
increased slower than total labor value-added (Figure 2.2). In fact, labor value-added of exports&#13;
declined from 25 percent of total labor value-added in 1995 to 15 percent in 2011. This&#13;
divergence occurred primarily between 2007 and 2011 when total labor value-added grew&#13;
significantly but total labor value-added of exports stagnated. The slower growth in the labor&#13;
content of exports relative to total production suggests that the export sector is creating less&#13;
jobs, both direct and indirect, than the non-export sector, or that the returns per labor unit may&#13;
be growing faster in the non-export sector.&#13;
&#13;
      Figure 2.1. Philippine value of exports grew much    Figure 2.2. Labor value-added of exports is also&#13;
      slower compared to its neighbors.                    growing much slower than total labor value-added&#13;
                                                           of the economy.&#13;

4.	      Several reasons are behind the countryâ&#128;&#153;s subpar growth of exports. These include i)&#13;
rising global competition, ii) declining growth of its key export products, particularly electronics,&#13;
iii) a strong real exchange rate, and iv) high bilateral trade costs, in particular, high export&#13;
transaction costs. This special focus discusses high export transaction costs, which affects SMEs&#13;
the most. Aside from high domestic export transaction costs, other bilateral trade costs also&#13;
affects SMEs and are discussed in Annex 2.1.&#13;
&#13;
5.	     The Philippines has higher export transaction costs relative to its neighbors. In the&#13;
2015 Doing Business Report,127 the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; overall performance in trading across borders is&#13;
generally poorer compared to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Even though it ranks&#13;
ahead of Indonesia and Vietnam in terms of processing time, it ranks last among neighboring&#13;
countries in terms of number of documents required and more so in the cost to export (Table&#13;
2.1). To export a 20-foot container, companies operating outside the Philippine Economic Zone&#13;

&#13;
6.	     High export transaction costs affect SMEs the most. Not only is de jure cost high, de&#13;
facto cost is often higher. In practice, exporters often face longer processing time and have to&#13;
pay grease money to stay in schedule.128 Often, high transaction costs can dissuade SMEs from&#13;
entering the market altogether. To help get around the tedious process, firms that still find it&#13;
profitable to export employ customs brokers and/or freight forwarders. However, availing&#13;
these services represents additional costs to exporters and are often beyond the financial&#13;
capacity of small exporters. Given this, there is huge scope in simplifying export procedures to&#13;
enhance participation of small firms, which would help create more and better jobs and make&#13;
growth more inclusive.&#13;
&#13;
7.	     This special focus analyzes Philippine exporting procedures and costs for a typical non-&#13;
PEZA small exporter (for goods shipped through sea), and recommends how these procedures&#13;
can be further simplified. It begins by giving an overview of the de jure export procedures and&#13;
costs. This is followed by an analysis of de facto costs based on survey results, and ends by&#13;
suggesting some recommendations to reduce export transaction costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Export procedures and de jure cost129&#13;
&#13;
8.	     For a first time non-PEZA exporter, exporting goods involves eight general steps&#13;
consisting of both manual and automated processes.130 These are: i) accreditation with the&#13;
government or with the exporter confederation, ii) system registration with the Bureau of&#13;
Customs (BOC) (the first two steps apply only to first time exporters), iii) submission of export&#13;
declaration (ED) form and supporting documents to the BOC, iv) application for export&#13;
commodity clearance for regulated products, v) document processing by BOC and issuance of&#13;
the authority to load (AL), vi) payment of wharfage and arrastre charges,131 vii) inspection of&#13;
regulated cargo by BOC, and viii) application for certificate of origin and/or certificate of&#13;
shipment, if needed (see Figure 2.4 for a summary flowchart). While efforts are being made to&#13;
automate each step of the export process, several steps still involve a physical or manual&#13;
process.&#13;
&#13;
9.	   For a first time exporter, the first step is to secure an exporter accreditation either&#13;
from government agencies or the Philippine Exporters Confederation (PhilExport).&#13;
Government agencies that grant accreditation include the Board of Investments (BOI), various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128&#13;
    Examples of grease money are those paid to hasten processing time, minimize intentional delays, and prevent&#13;
physical inspection of cargo.&#13;
129&#13;
    The sources for the de jure export procedures include the Export Development Council survey on export cost,&#13;
the Bureau of Customs, PhilExport, Philippine Ports Authority, and Doing Business 2015.&#13;
130&#13;
    In contrast, PEZA exporters typically go through a much simplified export procedure. They deal mainly with&#13;
PEZA rather than the Bureau of Customs. Once their electronically-filed export declaration is approved, they can&#13;
proceed with the shipping.&#13;
131&#13;
    Wharfage is charged for the use of port facilities while arrastre is charged for cargo handling.&#13;
                                                                                                             63&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
  investment promotion agencies (IPA),132 and the Export Marketing Bureau (EMB) of the&#13;
  Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Firms that are not registered with a particular&#13;
  government agency can get accreditation from PhilExport. Accreditation from government&#13;
  agencies is free of charge. However, accreditation from PhilExport costs PHP 4,000 annually for&#13;
  member companies and PHP 5,000 for non-member companies. PhilExport offers a PHP 3,000&#13;
  discounted price for barangay micro business enterprises.133 This step involves physical&#13;
  submission of forms and payment of fees while registration is approved online with a&#13;
  subsequent confirmation receipt sent via email.&#13;
&#13;
  10.	    The second step for first time exporters is to register with the client profile&#13;
  registration system (CPRS) of the electronic to mobile system (E2M) of the BOC. This is done&#13;
  electronically through any of the accredited value-added service providers (VASP).134 This step&#13;
  is free of charge. Once an exporter has an accreditation and has registered in CPRS, it does not&#13;
  have to redo the first two steps in future transactions, unless filing for an annual renewal of&#13;
  PhilExport accreditation.&#13;
&#13;
  11.	    The third step is to file an ED form, which is also done electronically in E2M via a VASP.&#13;
  Registered exporters can lodge their EDs into E2M through the VASP they registered with. De&#13;
  jure costs include the VASP fee of PHP 45 per ED, documentary stamp tax (DST) of PHP 115, and&#13;
  bank charge of PHP 300, for a total of PHP 460.135 De jure processing time is four minutes.&#13;
  Payment for lodging an ED is automatically debited from the registered bank account of the&#13;
  exporter.&#13;
&#13;
  12.	    The fourth step is to acquire an export commodity clearance (ECC) for regulated&#13;
  products. This step only applies to goods which are regulated such as copper concentrates, live&#13;
  animals, shells, and plants.136 An exporter of regulated goods needs to acquire an ECC from the&#13;
  respective government agency regulating the specific good. These agencies may charge a fee&#13;
  for the ECC depending on the type of good. Fees may be charged on a fixed cost per transaction&#13;
  or weight basis, or a combination of both. Fees are paid manually at the cashier of the&#13;
  concerned regulating agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  132&#13;
      The IPAs include i) Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, ii) Clark Development Corporation, iii) Poro Point&#13;
  Management Corporation, iv) Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, v) Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport&#13;
  Authority, and vi) Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan.&#13;
  133&#13;
      Under RA 9178, barangay micro business enterprises are defined as any business entity or enterprise engaged&#13;
  in the production, processing or manufacturing of products or commodities, including agro-processing, trading and&#13;
  services, whose total assets including those arising from loans but exclusive of the land on which the particular&#13;
  business entityâ&#128;&#153;s office, plant and equipment are situated, shall not be more than PHP 3 Million.&#13;
  134&#13;
      The three accredited value-added service providers (VASP) are Cargo Data Exchange Center, e-Konek Pilipinas,&#13;
  and InterCommerce Network Services. VASPs handle BOCâ&#128;&#153;s client-facing ICT processes, such as inputting export&#13;
  declarations into the system.&#13;
  135&#13;
      Bank charge is necessary since the documentary stamp tax is paid via electronic fund transfer.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.	   The fifth step is document processing by the BOC and the issuance of the AL. Once the&#13;
ED is approved, the exporter must submit a printed copy of the ED together with supporting&#13;
documents to the BOC Export Division for processing and release of AL. This step is free of&#13;
charge. De jure processing time usually takes 10 minutes for green lane exports if all&#13;
documentary requirements are complete while red lane exports usually take at least a day. The&#13;
clearance of the ED and issuance of the AL are usually done manually.&#13;
&#13;
14.	    The sixth step is payment of wharfage and arrastre fees. The fees are set by the&#13;
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA). Wharfage fees are paid manually to PPA collecting officers. For&#13;
non-containerized cargo, the fee is PHP 20.55 per metric ton or PHP 17.08 per cubic meter,&#13;
whichever is higher. For containerized cargo, it is charged per container and is based on the size&#13;
of the container: PHP 290.86 for 20 footers, PHP 369.54 for 35 footers, PHP 437.98 for 40&#13;
footers, and PHP 513.24 for 45 footers. Arrastre fees are paid manually at the port operatorâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
cashier. The charges for a full container load (FCL) are also based on the size of the container:&#13;
PHP 3,408.16 for 20 footers, and PHP 7,827.68 for 40 and 45 footers. All charges are inclusive of&#13;
the 12 percent value-added tax.&#13;
&#13;
15.	    The seventh step is submission of the ED and AL to concerned BOC divisions and&#13;
subsequent cargo inspection. This step is free of charge and takes about a day. If cargo is&#13;
containerized, the exporter submits the documents to the Customs Container Control Division&#13;
(CCCD), which verifies the lodged ED against the submitted ED and supervises cargo loading. If&#13;
cargo is non-containerized, the exporter deals with the Piers and Inspection Division. EDs of&#13;
exports tagged as green are automatically approved and cargo does not undergo inspection.&#13;
Those tagged as yellow go through document check, while those tagged as red undergo&#13;
physical inspection. According to Portcalls, around 70, 20, and 10 percent are tagged as green,&#13;
yellow, and red, respectively.137 Currently, as provided by Executive Order 230, only exporters&#13;
in the top 1,000 corporations are qualified to take advantage of the green lane.138&#13;
&#13;
16.	    The eighth and final step is securing a certificate of origin and/or certificate of&#13;
shipment from BOC.139 This step is only followed if required by the importing country. An&#13;
exporter submits a written request and supporting documents and pays a documentary stamp&#13;
tax of PHP 115 for each requested document. According to BOC, the application for the&#13;
certificate of origin takes five days, two hours, and 25 minutes. The application for the&#13;
certificate of shipment takes one day and 14 minutes. As a response to the ASEAN integration,&#13;
the BOC has begun to automate the process of filing for a certificate of origin and is currently&#13;
under pilot testing.&#13;

139&#13;
     The certificate of origin is a document that officially states that the exported goods are originating or&#13;
manufactured in the said country of origin. This document is usually needed to claim benefits under free trade&#13;
agreements. The certificate of shipment contains the nature of the shipment and is usually used to declare&#13;
whether a shipment represents a full or partial shipment when it reaches the country of destination.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  17.	    To minimize transaction cost, exporters often use the services of customs brokers or&#13;
  freight forwarders, who usually charge based on the value of the goods. Customs brokers can&#13;
  handle most exporting steps. Large exporters usually deal directly with freight forwarders which&#13;
  employ their own customs brokers and provide additional logistics support.&#13;

De facto cost of exporting&#13;
&#13;
18.	    In practice, exporters say that they pay more than the de jure cost to speed up the&#13;
process. In 2014, the Export Development Council (EDC) conducted a survey on the cost of&#13;
exporting (see Box 2.1 for a background of the survey). The survey finds that while corruption is&#13;
minimal, exporters have to pay grease money to facilitate faster transactions, especially if the&#13;
delay can lead to offloading of cargo or missing a shipment schedule (see Table 2.2 for a&#13;
summary of the various costs for exporting a 20-foot container). As prescribed, it takes&#13;
anywhere from seven days and 28 minutes to eight days, two hours, and 53 minutes to fulfill all&#13;
the export requirements. However, in reality, respondents report that it takes anywhere from&#13;
six days, three hours, and 30 minutes to seven days, eight hours, and 24 minutes. However, this&#13;
shorter processing time comes at higher cost. De jure costs total PHP 4,389 while total de facto&#13;
cost can go as high as PHP 4,833. These findings are corroborated by anecdotal evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Box 2.1. The Export Development Councilâ&#128;&#153;s (EDC) survey of export cost of compliance&#13;
&#13;
In 2014, the EDC conducted a survey on export compliance costs. Its main objective was to determine&#13;
whether exporters pay more than the legally-mandated fees and how long it really takes to export. The&#13;
findings were intended to help policymakers lower the costs of export (both de jure and de facto), and&#13;
standardize export costs and procedures across ports. The survey covered steps three to seven. It asked&#13;
respondents on the actual duration and costs incurred (for both official and un-receipted), together with&#13;
any comments they may have on each step.&#13;
&#13;
The surveyâ&#128;&#153;s 41 respondents had the following attributes: 38 of them were non-PEZA exporters that&#13;
went through the manual or E2M route, 28 exported their products through the Manila International&#13;
Container Terminal or the Port of Manila, 16 used brokers, while 20 used representatives (including&#13;
their own staff).&#13;
&#13;
The following observations are noteworthy:&#13;
&#13;
Â·	Only two respondents indicated that they went through the export procedure themselves. All&#13;
others had representatives or used the services of a customs broker. This may suggest that small&#13;
exporters were underrepresented in the survey.&#13;
&#13;
Â·	Respondents appear to be more concerned about cost rather than time given the higher&#13;
response rate for cost (around 50 percent) compared to time (around 25 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Â·	Even though the survey results show substantial differences between de jure and de facto costs,&#13;
only two respondents directly indicated that there were additional un-receipted costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.	    Steps one, two, and three de jure and de facto costs are generally similar, and&#13;
registration is usually approved in a week, but actual time spent can be longer than expected.&#13;
In step 3, the de facto cost is usually PHP 460 as well, although the survey reported several&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      67&#13;
&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  cases where exporters paid less (between PHP 445 to 485) to avoid paying the documentary&#13;
  stamp tax. In contrast, the de jure processing time of four minutes is not typically followed.&#13;
  Processing time typically ranges between three and 20 minutes, but one exporter reported that&#13;
  it took him one day to complete the step. The common problem cited by respondents is&#13;
  difficulty logging into the system, especially during peak hours.140&#13;
&#13;
  20.	   In step 5, although free of charge, informal fees are allegedly paid to speed up&#13;
  document processing. Based on the survey, a number of respondents mentioned that they&#13;
  pay PHP 70 to PHP 175 per document. Other respondents claim to pay as high as PHP 500.&#13;
  However, BOC maintains that there are no such informal fees. Though small in value, these&#13;
  could sum up to large amounts over repeated transactions. Per the survey, the actual time&#13;
  needed to complete this process ranges from five minutes to two hours.&#13;
&#13;
  21.	    In step 6, port officials allegedly allow exporters to pay lower fees if an official receipt&#13;
  is not issued. Some respondents pay a reduced wharfage fee of PHP 150 per FCL for 20 footers&#13;
  and PHP 200 for 40 footers if an official receipt is not issued. Although the difference between&#13;
  formal and informal fees is relatively small at around PHP 100 to 200, this still represents a&#13;
  substantial loss in government revenues if the practice is widespread.141 Furthermore, some&#13;
  exporters claim that port personnel ask for grease money to processing. The average time&#13;
  needed to complete this step ranges from 30 minutes to three hours.&#13;
&#13;
  22.	   In step 7, additional un-receipted costs are also observed in cargo inspection. This&#13;
  step does not involve de jure fees. However, survey respondents say that total informal fees&#13;
  paid range from PHP 300 to 425 per container. The de facto time needed to complete this step&#13;
  ranges from 13 minutes to two hours and 45 minutes. 	&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  140&#13;
       This is also supported by several anecdotal evidences. For instance, Mindanao exporters find the new E2M&#13;
  automated export declaration system expensive and time consuming. They often find themselves repeating the&#13;
  filing processing two to three times for each export transaction because export declarations use estimates of&#13;
  volume and weight, and final verification only occurs immediately prior to shipment. Discrepancies between actual&#13;
  and estimated volume and weight require a new declaration and the whole filing process needs to be repeated.&#13;
  Each filing would cost an exporter PHP 500 to 600 for document processing plus a PHP 45 IT fee.&#13;
  141&#13;
      For instance, if 20 percent of all exporters choose to pay the informal fees for each container, then this will cost&#13;
  the government at least PHP 80 million annually. This assumes container traffic of 1.5 million TEU.&#13;
&#13;
  68&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                Making Growth Work Better for Small Businesses&#13;

Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
23.	   The potential of Philippine exports can be harnessed by reducing the export&#13;
transaction costs. With a dynamic private sector, exporters, in particular, small exporters can&#13;
contribute and benefit more from higher growth. Realizing this requires a number of reforms to&#13;
reduce export transaction costs. Some of these recommendations are already in progress, and&#13;
would complement reforms in reducing non-tariff barriers, enhancing logistics support, and&#13;
improving productivity of key export products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
142&#13;
   This is computed by adding the prescribed wharfage and arrastre fees for 20 footers, which are PHP 290.86 and&#13;
3,408.16, respectively.&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                        69&#13;
&amp;#12;PHILIPPINE Economic update - OCTOBER 2015&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  24.	    First, the government needs to enhance and implement the National Single Window&#13;
  (NSW) automated system. In 2007, the Philippine government started using the NSW, an&#13;
  internet-based system that helps traders access information and submit documents through a&#13;
  single entry point to fulfil all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements.&#13;
  However, implementation is lacking, especially for small exporters. In addition, further&#13;
  enhancement of the NSW should facilitate multiple clearances by concerned government&#13;
  agencies (which number around 30) via a single gateway/website, as well as the full integration&#13;
  of the system with the BOCâ&#128;&#153;s declaration processing system. The government can also explore&#13;
  extending the risk management functionality in the BOC IT system to other agencies.143&#13;
&#13;
  25.	    Second, information on all export procedures, processes, fees, rules, and regulations&#13;
  as well as agreed performance standards needs to be clear, monitored, and published in a&#13;
  single website. As of publication, the BOC website does not appear to have detailed&#13;
  information on export procedures.144 Without these information, monitoring the actual cost of&#13;
  exporting will be difficult. Addressing this requires online publication of detailed procedures&#13;
  and the corresponding cost and time standards, as well as regular monitoring of actual&#13;
  performance. Moreover, creating a simple, user-friendly trade portal similar to what has been&#13;
  set-up in Laos, and now being rolled out in Cambodia and Myanmar, would benefit exporters.&#13;
&#13;
  26.	    Finally, redundant steps need to be eliminated. For instance, exporters file an ED&#13;
  online but have to submit a printed copy of the ED to various BOC divisions. Instead of having&#13;
  the exporter submit these documents, the BOCâ&#128;&#153;s system needs to be enhanced so that any BOC&#13;
  division will have access to the EDs once they are filed online. This will help reduce transaction&#13;
  costs as well as opportunities for corrupt practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  143&#13;
      As the NSW is not yet fully functional, some functionalities that would normally be expected to be managed by&#13;
  the NSW are currently handled by VASPs. However, in a single window environment, information should be able&#13;
  to reach all parties without the need for a private intermediary. When this happens, VASPs can adapt and provide&#13;
  complementary functions such as providing value added services to the private sector or IT support to individual&#13;
  industries.&#13;
  144&#13;
          The DTIâ&#128;&#153;s Export Marketing Bureau has a general â&#128;&#156;Guide to Philippine exporting proceduresâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
  (http://www.dti.gov.ph/emb/index.php/exporting-essentials-2/export-procedures). However, like the BOC&#13;
  website, this guide does not contain any cost or time standards.&#13;

                                               Annex 2.1. Lowering bilateral trade costs to raise exports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  1.	     Bilateral trade costs are important factors that determine a countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
  competitiveness. This Annex benchmarks the Philippines in terms of bilateral trade costs,&#13;
  including logistics and connectivity, and discusses reforms the government has undertaken to&#13;
  reduce them.&#13;
&#13;
  2.	    The Philippines has high bilateral trade costs.145 As an archipelago with no immediate&#13;
  neighbors, slightly higher trade costs are to be expected when compared to countries with land&#13;
  borders. Yet trade costs between the Philippines and its immediate maritime neighbors (i.e.,&#13;
  Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia) are generally higher compared to trade costs between these&#13;
  countries (Annex Table 2.1). For instance, the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; trade costs with Indonesia are almost&#13;
  twice the trade costs between Indonesia and Malaysia. Trade costs between Vietnam and&#13;
  Malaysia are the lowest among the six pairings.&#13;
&#13;
  3.	    In particular, trade costs with China are high. China is the countryâ&#128;&#153;s third largest export&#13;
  market with 14 percent share in total exports in 2014. Compared with its closest ASEAN&#13;
  neighbors, only Indonesia (which is farther from China) has trade costs with China that are&#13;
  comparable to the Philippines, while costs for other countries are 20 to 40 percent lower. In&#13;
  general, the Philippines is a more costly partner. Using Australia as a baseline, the Philippines is&#13;
  the most costly (i.e., Philippine value of 136 compared to 107 for Indonesia, 97 for Vietnam,&#13;
  and 75 for Malaysia).&#13;

     Bilateral trade costs capture the added costs that producers face when selling their products internationally and&#13;
  is driven by the distance between the partners, logistics facilities, existence of regular maritime and air transport&#13;
  services, customs and other procedures, tariffs, quotas, standards, and other non-tariff restrictions. Higher&#13;
  bilateral trade costs result in smaller bilateral trade flows.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
4.	    The logistics performance index (LPI)146 also implies high trade costs for the&#13;
Philippines. While caution must be exercised in interpreting small differences in LPI scores,&#13;
data from 2014 suggest that the Philippines fares the worst on overall logistics performance&#13;
compared to the major economies in the region (Annex Figure 2.1). More detailed dimensions&#13;
of the LPI reveal that the country is weak on trade and transport-related infrastructure, which&#13;
exacerbates the countryâ&#128;&#153;s connectivity challenges.&#13;
&#13;
5.	    The Philippines is also affected by low connectivity. Data from the liner shipping&#13;
connectivity index (LSCI)147 shows that the Philippinesâ&#128;&#153; score of 20.3 is less than half of Vietnam&#13;
or Thailand, one fifth of Malaysia, and only one ninth of China (Annex Figure 2.2). The poor&#13;
performance is largely explained by lack of diversity of connections and low volume. For&#13;
example, in 2014, deadweight tonnage (dwt) handled in Malaysia was 16.8 million, 15.5 million&#13;
in Indonesia, 6.8 million in Thailand, but only 3 million in the Philippines.148&#13;

6.	     The government recognizes the issue of high trade costs and has taken steps to lower&#13;
them. In 2014, the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) lowered entry barriers and&#13;
streamlined the licensing processes for vessels, allowing shipping companies to get their&#13;
licenses in nine days compared to 52 days previously, leading to savings of up to PHP 30 million&#13;
for large vessels. In July 2015, congress passed the â&#128;&#156;Foreign Co-loading Actâ&#128;&#157; that allowed&#13;
foreign vessels to transship imported and exported goods across multiple ports in the&#13;
Philippines. In addition, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) initiated a public-private&#13;
partnership (PPP) project to modernize the Davao Sasa Port. Four more ports will follow: Iloilo,&#13;
146&#13;
    The logistics performance index (LPI), developed by the World Bank, is based on a survey of logistics professionals&#13;
and scores countries on several dimensions, including trade and transport related infrastructure, logistics services,&#13;
and customs procedures.&#13;
147&#13;
    The LSCI aggregates information such as volumes of containers for the economy relative to its size, number of&#13;
shipping lines, and maximum boat size serving the country.&#13;

  Zamboanga, General Santos, and Cagayan de Oro. In aviation, the Mactan-Cebu International&#13;
  Airport PPP project was awarded in June 2015. Further PPPs are planned for other regional&#13;
  airports such as Davao, Laguindingan, Iloilo, and Bacolod. Finally, since 2013, the Department of&#13;
  Agriculture has implemented a risk management program for quarantine clearances to&#13;
  facilitate the movement of low risk agricultural products. Efficient and timely implementation&#13;
  of these projects will be key to lowering trade costs and thereby raising exports.&#13;

            Philippine economic update : making growth
            work better for small businesses
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Philippines is among the strongest
            performers in the region, bucking the trend. In the first
            half (H1) of 2015, among the major economies in the region,
            the only countries to accelerate their quarterly growth
            rates were the Philippines, from 5 to 5.6 percent, and
            Vietnam. In spite of this acceleration, for the two quarters
            combined, Philippine growth rate came out at 5.3 percent,
            its lowest half year growth rate since 2011. On the demand
            side, the strong performance of private domestic demand at
            8.1 percent, supported by record low inflation and robust
            remittances, drove GDP growth. However, the slow pace of
            public spending and the contraction in net exports pulled
            down GDP growth. On the supply side, the onset of El Niño
            led to stagnant agriculture growth. Meanwhile, growth in
            industry and services was respectable, with both sectors
            growing by around 5.8 percent. In Q3, available high
            frequency data suggest an improving economy, in particular,
            acceleration in government spending. Export transaction
            costs are high, relative to its neighbors. Not only is de
            jure exporting cost very high, exporters reveal that they
            have to pay more than the legally mandated fees to expedite
            the process. For small exporters, the cost of exporting can
            be high enough to discourage them from entering or remaining
            in business. To lower export transaction costs, the report
            recommends: i) enhancing coordination among trade-related
            government agencies through the national single window and
            improving the efficiency of Bureau of Customs’ information
            technology system, ii) establishing and publishing clear
            performance standards, and setting up a national trade
            website to provide information on export processes and
            procedures, and iii) eliminating or re-engineering redundant
            or inefficient export steps. These reforms would complement
            reforms to reduce non-tariff barriers, enhance logistics
            support, and improve productivity of key export products.
