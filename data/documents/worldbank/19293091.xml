The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;

recommendation pursuant to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association grant to the&#13;

selected inter-regional corridors and support the sustainability of the federal road network.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such credit, and of the&#13;
purpose to which the proceeds of the credit are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such credit are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said project is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Recipient and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Recipient.&#13;
3.      Accordingly, the Committee finds that said project merits financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said project for such assistance.&#13;
