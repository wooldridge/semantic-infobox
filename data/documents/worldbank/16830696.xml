Annex I&#13;
Description of activities and expenditure categories under the Project&#13;
Ins'itutional Background&#13;
1. The institutional structure is based on a two-tier arrangement, involving an existing&#13;
Pa :.nership (as defined below) and an existing Multi-donor Trust Fund:&#13;
2.  The TerrAfrica Initiative for Sustainable Land Management in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
(tht "Partnership") is a Global Partnership Program (GPP) established by resolution of the&#13;
Ccistitutive Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Partnership held in Paris on September&#13;
15 2005.&#13;
3. The Partnership was established among partners including, at the time of establishment,&#13;
representatives of Sub Saharan African countries, international organizations, regional&#13;
organizations, bilateral institutions, scientific organizations and civil society. It is a regional&#13;
plaform to enable governments of sut-Saharan Africa, the international development community&#13;
and other global, regional and national stakeholders to better work together to scale-up country-&#13;
driven sustainable land management. It is a collective and inclusive effort for Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
wf 1ch aims to foster long-term integrated and harmonized strategies, policy dialogue and actions,&#13;
bu ding on the comparative advantages of partners.&#13;
4. Further to the decision of the Constitutive Meeting of the Executive Committee dated&#13;
September 15, 2005, the TerrAfrica Leveraging Fund (TLF) was established as a Programmatic&#13;
Tr ist Fund to participate in the financing of activities included in the joint Annual Work Program&#13;
(as defined below) of the Partnership. The TLF is intended to provide a flexible financing&#13;
mechanism to address targeted needs that are not already adequately covered by existing funding&#13;
mechanisms.&#13;
Governance Structure&#13;
5. The TerrAfrica governance structure is lean. There is currently an Executive Committee and a&#13;
Secretariat ("TerrAfrica Secretariat") now hosted by the Africa Union's NEPAD Planning and&#13;
Coordination Agency (NPCA). Ad-hcc working groups are convened among partners as needed&#13;
to assist on specific tasks (such as reviewing climate analytics, devising plans for TerrAfrica's&#13;
presence at the UNFCCC Durban conference in December 2011, or vetting the Partnership's&#13;
M&amp;E framework).&#13;
6. A joint Annual Work Program shall be prepared by partners and countries based on the&#13;
template of activities in the TerrAfrica Business Planning Framework, which is updated every 5&#13;
years in a process led by NPCA and approved by the Executive Committee. The emphasis in the&#13;
Second Business Planning Framework (2010-2014) is on climate change and SLM, in particular&#13;
the three priority SLM themes of (i) watershed management, (ii) conservation agriculture, and&#13;
(iiL) linkages between energy and land. This focus was agreed by the Executive Committee at its&#13;
October 2009 meeting in Buenos Aire;, Argentina.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-4-&#13;
7. The TerrAfrica Partnership's Executive Committee is chaired by the NPCA and is responsible&#13;
for, inter alia:&#13;
(i) Overall guidance and strategic direction of the Partnership;&#13;
(ii) Review and approval ofjoint Annual Work Programs (as defined below) and related&#13;
budget and resources allocation prepared by the Partnership's Secretariat; and&#13;
(iii) Supervision of the performance of the TerrAfrica Leveraging Fund (which is&#13;
administered by the World Bank).&#13;
8. The Partnership's Secretariat reviews proposals of activities to be carried out by Partners&#13;
under the joint Annual Work Program (the "Annual Work Program"). Under the guidance of the&#13;
Partnership's Executive Committee, the Secretariat consolidates the joint Annual Work Program,&#13;
and develops a budget allocating available resources to activities included in the proposed Annual&#13;
Work Plan and, inter alia, clearly delineating the proposals of activities that would be eligible to&#13;
receive financing from the TLF. In coordination with the TerrAfrica Secretariat, the Bank&#13;
determines which activities included in the proposed Annual Work Plan are to be supported by&#13;
the TLF. The Bank retains fiduciary responsibility for the TLF.&#13;
Objective and Description of the Activities under the Project&#13;
9. Objectives. The overall objective of the TLF is to provide strategically targeted and flexible&#13;
financial support to:&#13;
(i) Strengthen awareness, harmonization, strategic directions on opportunities and&#13;
modalities for improved sustainable land management scale-up and effectiveness;&#13;
(ii) Improve and share analytical underpinnings to support policy dialogue and decision&#13;
making; and&#13;
(iii) Catalyze funding at country level.&#13;
To meet these objectives, the TLF provides strategic seed financing and other small grant support&#13;
for activities approved in the joint Annual Work Program. As mentioned above, the recent and&#13;
current joint Annual Work Program (2010, 2011) and the current Second Business Planning&#13;
Framework (2010-2014) all emphasize the linkages between SLM and climate change. SLM is&#13;
widely recognized by partners as the key approach to both mitigate and adapt to climate change&#13;
and variability in Africa. TerrAfrica has therefore been focusing much of its support on the three&#13;
aforementioned priority SLM themes of: (i) watershed management, (ii) conservation agriculture,&#13;
and (iii) linkages between energy and land. What these three themes have in common is an&#13;
emphasis on the landscape as a system that needs to be managed holistically. In line with the joint&#13;
Annual Work Program and the Second Business Planning Framework, the TLF is expected to&#13;
help deliver on the immediate objective of scaling up sustainable and climate-smart land and&#13;
water management practices on the ground, in order to accumulate landscape carbon and help&#13;
bridge Africa's climate adaptation deficit.&#13;
10. Results. A simplified results framework is presented below. This results framework is a&#13;
subset of the Partnership's broader M&amp;E framework which guides the joint annual work&#13;
programming process and which guided the development of the Second Business Planning&#13;
Framework. Targets in the results framework below are somewhat fluid, given that the TLF is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
seciing additional external support from existing and potential new partners, and is also actively&#13;
leveraging other sources of funding including IDA, GEF, other trust funds, and national budgets.&#13;
Targets could be revised upwards if additional contributions to the TLF are made available or if&#13;
pa-illel co-financing is secured. It is important to note that discrete activities will have&#13;
cu;tomized M&amp;E arrangements calibrated to local circumstances, budgets, and capacities. The&#13;
spicific results include:&#13;
Result 1. Countries scale up SLM practices in priority zones, in three key priority themes of&#13;
Conservation Agriculture, watershed management and energy poverty. This will lead to&#13;
multiple wins on the ground, including enhanced accumulation of carbon in soil and biomass,&#13;
higher yields and lower yield variability, access to more diverse livelihoods, more predictable&#13;
water availability, increased household access to renewable terrestrial energy sources,&#13;
reduced siltation of reservoirs, and in situ biodiversity conservation in active farmscapes.&#13;
Result 2. Climate risk incorporated into decision making on SLM at Country and Regional&#13;
levels. This will lead to better knowledge dissemination and capacity building such as:&#13;
improved practical knowledge in sub-Saharan African countries about climate risk to land&#13;
and natural resource dependent livelihoods (such as via ClimDev); improved knowledge and&#13;
capacity to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies through application of appropriate&#13;
SLM approaches; and better institutional performance on investment planning, monitoring&#13;
and knowledge management.&#13;
