including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;

including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;

finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;

request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;

audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;
such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such&#13;
