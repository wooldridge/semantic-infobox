Note No.98   Regulating Market Risk in Banks-&#13;
The Options&#13;
Constantinos     Market risk has become an increasingly important issue for banks and consequently for bank&#13;
Stepbanou        regulation. Regulators, concerned about the costs of bank insolvency and of systemic risk arising&#13;
from the volatility of bank trading portfolios, have developed three different approaches to set-&#13;
ting risk-based minimum capital adequacy standards for market risk. This Note evaluates those&#13;
three approaches-building blocs, internal models, and precommitment-and their possible im-&#13;
plications for bank capital, competition, and profitability and pricing decisions.&#13;
There are four major categories of risk that arise   Bank regulators have two main concerns about&#13;

            Regulators concerned about the costs of
            bank insolvency and of systemic risk arising from the
            volatility of bank trading portfolios have developed three
            different approaches to setting risk-based minimum capital

            those three approaches--building blocs, internal models, and
