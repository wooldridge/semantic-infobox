                            Broches, Aron&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Robert E. Asher, on 1984-04-18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Aron Broches, a Dutch national and international lawyer whose&#13;
association with the World Bank dates back to the Bretton Woods&#13;
Conference in the summer of 1944. From 1942-1946 he was legal adviser&#13;
to the Netherlands Government and to its Economic Mission in the U.S.&#13;
He joined the Bank in 1946, became General Counsel in 1959, and&#13;
assumed the additional title of Vice-President in 1972. He retired in&#13;
1979. From 1967 to 1980 he also served as Secretary General of the&#13;
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes&#13;
(ICSID).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In 1944, Broches was a member of the delegation assigned to the&#13;
drafting committee of Commission I dealing with the Fund, since there&#13;
was one also for the Bank. He talks of the number of proposals&#13;
discussed including the famous lending limit, and a tough-sounding&#13;
provision on the investment of the special reserve funds. Other&#13;
provisions covered, namely the right of a country to control use of&#13;
its paid-in capital. Broches' involvement in the inaugural meeting of&#13;
the Bank in Savannah in March 1946 mostly as an observer, noting the&#13;
fight between Lord Keynes [Governor for the U.K.] and F.M. Vinson&#13;
[Secretary of U.S. Treasury] about the location of the Fund and the&#13;
Bank where initially New York seemed like the logical place, and the&#13;
other main issue of the role of the Executive Directors, their&#13;
salaries, and whether they ought to be permanent officials or persons&#13;
coming from capitals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches' retrospective appraisal of Eugene Meyer's presidency as&#13;
secondhand; mostly that he was not highly thought of, that it was due&#13;
&amp;#12;to his lack of initiative that the Board stepped in to fill in the&#13;
vacuum as did the U.S. Director, Emilio Collado, thus resulting in&#13;
Meyer's resignation in December 1946, leading to a tense interregnum&#13;
period prior to the arrival of McCloy, Garner, and Black [in March&#13;
1947]. The memorandum on relations between the President and the&#13;
Executive Directors was the basis on which McCloy accepted the&#13;
presidency. Under McCloy the Bank's first loans were made, they were&#13;
for European reconstruction; general purpose rather than specific&#13;
project loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Broches addresses the period after the first Annual Meeting and&#13;
prior to Meyer's resignation, where various policy and technical&#13;
issues regarding the kind of agreements the Bank should have were&#13;
formulated. Broches arguing strongly in favor of international law as&#13;
applicable law, and an international forum for dispute settlement.&#13;
Article 102 of the U.N. Charter requires that international agreements&#13;
be registered and published with the U.N. Secretary General otherwise&#13;
they cannot be invoked by any U.N. organ. Broches was a proponent of&#13;
registration. The Bank was also willing to publish its agreements&#13;
making it the only public international lending institution that does.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Broches elaborates on the Bank's early difficulties with Poland and&#13;
Czechoslovakia, resulting in the Poles withdrawing from the Bank on&#13;
March 15, 1950, and the Czechs suspended from membership and then&#13;
automatically ceasing to be members a year later under the Articles of&#13;
Agreement. Broches talk about the Bank's involvement in international&#13;
mediation or settling international disputes such as Black's&#13;
conciliation role in connection with the City of Tokyo bonds, and the&#13;
Bank's mediation between the Suez Canal Company and Egypt, all serving&#13;
as forerunners for the establishment of ICSID (International Centre&#13;
for Settlement of International Disputes) in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Broches succeeded Dave Sommers as General Counsel [1959]. He mentions&#13;
how the functioning of the Legal Department changed with the&#13;
broadening of the Bank's activities and the rise of operations&#13;
&amp;#12;requiring organizational changes. Mentions the employment of&#13;
professional women and, in that context, Virginia Morsey in early&#13;
1947, who was for a long time the only woman lawyer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Insofar as the interpretation of the Articles of Agreement is&#13;
concerned, the Executive Directors or the Board of Governors are the&#13;
final authority; originally a U.S. proposal since the operations of&#13;
both the Bank and the Fund are so unique. Broches elaborates on the&#13;
capital valuation issue on the question of transfers of Bank profits&#13;
to IDA, which is the question of the Bank's authority to make a grant&#13;
to IDA out of its profits which would otherwise be distributed to the&#13;
shareholders or kept as a reserve. The final agreement resulting in&#13;
the interpretation which was not appealed and was noted by the Board&#13;
of Governors at the '64 Annual Meeting in Tokyo; exercising for the&#13;
first time the power to make grants pursuant to the Directors'&#13;
interpretation. Broches also talks briefly about the policy issues&#13;
raised by the proposal of grants to IDA, and IDA replenishments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Broches mentions how the access to information improved with the&#13;
creation of the Operations Evaluation Department with its completion&#13;
and evaluation reports. He also talks about becoming head of one of&#13;
the general survey missions to Nigeria in 1950.&#13;
