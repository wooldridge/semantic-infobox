Total          26  j    19            45&#13;
Project Objectives:       The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to help remove critical&#13;
infrastructural bottlenecks; improve essential services and facilities;&#13;
preserve existing infrastructural assets; create productive employment; and&#13;
(b) to strengthen the local government system, particularly to rationalize&#13;
roles and responsibilities and build finance and managerial capacity.&#13;
Project Description:      The proposed project would have two main parts. Part A, the&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement component, would help&#13;
support: the rehabilitation, reconstruction, extension and maintenance of&#13;
vital high priority village, municipal and regional road, water, wastewater&#13;
and sanitation networks, systems, structures, plant and facilities, including&#13;
neighborhood upgrading; and technical assistance and studies for sub-&#13;
project preparation and supervision. Part B, the Local Go.ernment Reform&#13;
and Capacity Building component, would help support institutional,&#13;
financial and managerial reforms and development in the Local&#13;
Government systewr. Supplementing the two main components would be a&#13;
Managerial Support and Incremental Operating Expenses component (Part&#13;
C) which would help finance the establishment of essential project&#13;
management and monitoring capacity, including operating costs and critical&#13;
materials and equipment needs.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:       The project would have a particularly positive impact on jobs, directly&#13;
creating about 3,500 man-years of employment; improve public health&#13;
services; protect and conserve sensitive and limited water resources, and&#13;
reduce the losses due to network inadequacies and inefficient utility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
operations; make a start in improving roads, reducing traffic congestion,&#13;
travel time, and vehicle operating costs; preserve existing infrastructural&#13;
assets; rationalize and strengthen both central and local institutions;&#13;
mobilize local initiative and resources, reducing dependence on central&#13;
budgets and authorities; increase local autonomy and accountability;&#13;
improve resource allocation; open up opportunities for private sector&#13;
participation and development through consulting, contracting, and&#13;
manufacturing inputs; and help lay the foundation for sustainable&#13;
development.&#13;
The project faces considerable risks, many of which cannot be avoided.&#13;
These risks fall into two broad categories: (a) Political and Institutional&#13;
Risks: the success of the project requires stability in WBG, steady progress&#13;
in the bilateral  negotiations, and a maturation of internal political&#13;
processes. It will also require that incentive structures at central and local&#13;
levels are positive and mutually reinforcing. (b) Managerial and Technical&#13;
Risks: effective and timely implementation of the project requires the early&#13;
consideration by the Executive Authority of the Palestinian Council&#13;
(EAPC), the executive arm of said Council, of measures to strengthen the&#13;
SMs, MLG and the other implementation agencies, and the early&#13;
rationalization of PECDAR. It also requires the strengthening of the local&#13;
contracting and construction industry. Risks would be difficult to manage&#13;
but would be minimized through dialogue, careful crafting of incentive&#13;
structures, appropriately targeted technical assistance and close, on-ground&#13;
supervision in WBG.&#13;
Poverty Category:         The project is not a part of a core poverty programn but will support&#13;
Palestinian effort to alleviate poverty by creating a significant number of&#13;
lower skilled jobs at the municipal and village levels where poverty is most&#13;
widespread. Moreover, improvements to the water and sanitation services&#13;
will also have a positive impact on reduction of related diseases, which&#13;
most often affect the poor.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return: All investments exceed 14 percent ERR. Because of the open-ended nature&#13;
of the project, an overall weighted average ERR is not considered&#13;
appropriate.&#13;

MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.1    With the signing of the Declaration of Principles between Israei and the Palestinians in September&#13;
1993, Gaza became relatively autonomous. As a result of signing the Interim Agreement on September&#13;
28, 1995, similar autonomy has now been extended to parts of the West Bank. These agreements open&#13;
up new opportunities for Palestinian development, but they also pose rnew challenges. Among the more&#13;
important of the opportunities is the chance to begin systematically to address critical economic, social,&#13;
institutional and infrastructural problems, including, particularly, the problems of the local government&#13;
system. The challenge is to do so efficiently and equitably, and in a manner which best promotes long&#13;
term economic and social development objectives.&#13;
1.2    The Economy: The West Bank and Gaza (WBG) comprises some 6,000 sq. k-n and had a&#13;
population of 2 million in 1994. This population has been growing at the relatively high rate of about&#13;
4 percent per annum. Despite some recent positive signs the economy continues to experience severe&#13;
strain. The decline which began with the onset of the Intifada in 1987 still continues. This has had a&#13;
considerable negative impact on living standards, and in 1993 it was estimated that about 17 percent of&#13;
the population of the West Bank and 33 percent of that of Gaza lived in poverty. Tentative estimates for&#13;
1994 suggest that while Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 7.3 percent in real terms, Gross&#13;
National Product (GNP) grew less (3 percent in real terms) due mainly to the continued loss of&#13;
employment opportunities for Palestinian workers in Israel. Estimates for 1995 suggest real GDP growth&#13;
of 3.5 percent, but due to further loss in employment opportunities for Palestinian workers in Israel,i' and&#13;
allowing for population increase, real per capita GNP probably declined by some 7 percent. Also, the&#13;
already high 20 percent unemployment rate in 1994 is estimated to have risen to 25 percent. This&#13;
indicates that the positive job creation performance, particularly in residential construction, was&#13;
insufficient to overcome the impact of repeated Israeli border closures. The prospects for 1996 had&#13;
appeared somewhat more promising until the recent bombings in Israel. These have led to extended&#13;
border closings which have had a severely negative impact on economic and social life. Unemployment&#13;
is now at crisis levels, particularly in Gaza.&#13;
1.3   Infrastructure: Years of economic and political dislocation, neglect of local institutions and&#13;
under-investment in the public sector have contributed significantly to the present grossly inadequate level&#13;
of infrastructure and services. These levels are now far below those in countries with comparable per&#13;
capita GNP. For example, average urban water supply is only about 60 liters per capita per day&#13;
(compared to 115 in Tunisia and 137 in Jordan); in many areas water quality is low; system losses are&#13;
high; many villages are unserved; and few municipalities have adequate wastewater collection, treatment&#13;
or disposal systems. The road network density, while typical of countries at similar income levels, has&#13;
deteriorated to the point where, without immediate rehabilitation, past investments may be completely&#13;
lost. Some 50 percent of the roads in Gaza are unpaved, and it is estimated 40 percent of the road system&#13;
in the West Bank is below acceptable service levels. Electricity consumption (680 kWh per capita per&#13;
year) is low compared to Egypt and Jordan; networks and systems are generally in a poor condition;&#13;
services are unreliable; street lighting is almost non-existent; and some 138 villages have no services or&#13;
1/    About 63,000 job opportunities were lost between 1992 and 1994, and another 23,000 during 1994/95.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                 Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
are dependent on isolated diesel-generated supplies. In general, infrastructure and services provision is&#13;
far lower, and networks and facilities are in a far greater state of disrepair in Gaza than in the West Bank.&#13;
These conditions cannot be significantly and sustainably improved unless urgent attention is paid to&#13;
rationalizing and strengthening of the local government (LG) system (see Annex 2 for further details).&#13;
1.4   Institutions: Following autonomy in the Gaza Strip, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)&#13;
and the Government of the State of Israel entered into the Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho Area&#13;
on May 4, 1994, which, among other things, established the Palestinian Authority as its core policy&#13;
making body, and by the end of May 1994, a full complement of ministries was announced. Since then&#13;
a major effort has been made to consolidate these ministries and to develop administrative capacity. More&#13;
recently, separate national agencies have been established to manage the power and water sectors. Earlier&#13;
(in late 1993), the PLO had established the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and&#13;
Reconstruction (PECDAR) as the main transitional vehicle for economic policy making, programmning,&#13;
management and administration. With the development of ministries, PECDAR was expected to have&#13;
been restructured or absorbed into one or another of the new ministries. This has not happened.&#13;
Consequently, there is now a considerable lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities at the central&#13;
level. This has slowed institutional consolidation significantly and complicated policy. In October 1995,&#13;
the jurisdiction of the new Palestinian institutions was extended to the newly autonomous areas in the&#13;
West Bank. This jurisdiction is expected to widen as the peace process unfolds, with obvious implications&#13;
for central and local government capacity building. Notwithstanding these difficulties, significant progress&#13;
has been made in establishing central government institutions, but much remains to be done to develop&#13;
capacity equal to the enormous task of nation building.&#13;
1.5    Apart from LG institutions (discussed separately below), two other sets of institutions play vital&#13;
roles in the social and economic life of WBG: the UN agencies and the NGO's. Since 1967, the United&#13;
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has played a critical role in providing housing, health,&#13;
education, welfare and infrastructural services to refugee families; UNDP and UNICEF, respectively,&#13;
help deliver water and sanitation, and children's services. Some 900 to 1,000 mostly local NGOs,&#13;
responding to a political and institutional vacuum, provided a vast array of services, but particularly in&#13;
the health, housing and higher education sectors.&#13;
1.6    Local Government: Historically, LGs have been the cornerstone of Palestinian governance.&#13;
They have also been key providers of public goods and services in WBG. Municipalities in particular&#13;
have well-established service delivery and regulatory functions including electricity, water supply,&#13;
sanitation, solid waste management, local roads, libraries, parks and recreation, fire abatement, slaughter&#13;
houses, markets, land use planning, building and development approval, and business and professional&#13;
licensing. The LG system is composed of 31 municipalities, 103 village councils and some 400 villages.&#13;
The 31 municipalities accounted for more than 62 percent of the total population in 1994. Gaza differs&#13;
significantly from the West Bank in that it is considerably poorer (per capita GNP in 1994 of US$1,290&#13;
vs US$2,190 in the West Bank), is far more highly urbanized and far less fragmented geographically.&#13;
Its population density is about 10 times that of the West Bank, and three of its five municipalities (Gaza&#13;
City, Khan Younis and Rafah) account for nearly 75 percent of the total Gaza population of 0.8 million.&#13;
Furthermore, about 55 percent of Gaza's population reside in refugee camps, a far higher percentage than&#13;
in the West Bank. Of the 26 municipalities in the West Bank, the three largest (Nablus, Hebron and&#13;
Ramallah/Al Bireh) account for less than 20 percent of the total West Bank population of 1.2 million, and&#13;
the median municipality has a population of less than 13,000 persons. This geographical dispersion in&#13;
the West Bank presents special challenges for governance and the efficient di-livery of public services;&#13;
so does the concentration of population Gaza, albeit of a different order.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                              3&#13;
1.7    Legally and institutionally, the LG system in WBG is rooted in the British Mandate. However,&#13;
Gaza's legal traditions and institutions differ somewhat from those of the West Bank. This is so because&#13;
in the aftermath of the 1948 War and the establishment of the state of Israel, Gaza came under Egyptian&#13;
administration while the West Bank became part of Jordan. Following the 1967 War between Israel and&#13;
its neighbors, both areas came under Israeli occupation, and fell under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Civil&#13;
Administration (CA). With the advent of autonomy, the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) became&#13;
responsible for managing the system. Since then MLG has been moving to unify the two systems, clarify&#13;
its role and consolidating itself.  To date its focus has been on preparing for national elections,&#13;
successfully held in January 1996. However, it has also begun to actively develop managerial systems&#13;
and has drafted a new LG law for consideration by the Palestinian Council. This draft law (the second&#13;
of two drafts) or some modified version is expected to be considered by the new Palestinian Council and&#13;
will form the basis for LG elections due in the latter half of 1996. Unlike the first draft which foresaw&#13;
a considerable degree of local autonomy, the second draft envisages a considerable degree of&#13;
centralization (see Annexes 2 and 3 for further details).&#13;
Sector Issues&#13;
1.8    The proposed project would focus on infrastructure rehabilitation in two sectors: roads, and&#13;
water, wastewater, and sanitation, and on some of the more critical problems in the LG sector.3' A&#13;
review of the key sector issues and proposed short (1-3 year) and medium-term (3-5 year) strategies is&#13;
presented in Annexes I and 2. A brief summary is presented below.&#13;
1.9   Infrastructure Issues. The most critical issues in the infrastructure sectors are the following:&#13;
(a) Roads: Inadequate network development; improving accessibility to villages; arresting the&#13;
deterioration and improving the quality of the existing network; relieving congestion on key&#13;
sections of the network; preserving existing assets through increased attention to maintenance;&#13;
improving surface water drainage, thus reducing the incidence of flooding and flood damage&#13;
(particularly in sections of Gaza); rationalizing the allocation of responsibilities at the central level&#13;
(between the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Ministry of Works (MOW) and PECDAR), and&#13;
between central and local levels, for system (municipal, village and regional) management and&#13;
planning (see para. 1. 10a); and strengthening the capacity at all levels to plan, finance, manage,&#13;
improve and maintain the network; and reducing delays and disruptions from repeated Israeli&#13;
border closures.&#13;
(b) Water, Wastewater and Sanitation: Improving water resource management--particularly&#13;
management of the highly sensitive Gaza aquifer; improving water supply delivery systems;&#13;
improving coverage and service quality and reliability to municipalities and villages; preserving&#13;
scarce resources by reducing the incidence of leakage in existing networks; improving&#13;
environmental and public health conditions through improving sewerage collection, treatment and&#13;
disposal system; improving wastewater resource management through increased recycling;&#13;
improving the overall efficiency of the utilities--currently fragmented among many individual&#13;
municipalities--through consolidation, commercialization and privatization; protecting Palestinian&#13;
water rights; and strengthening the policy making and regulatory capacity of the newly established&#13;
Palestine Water Authority (PWA); and&#13;
2/    The choice of sectors and rationale for the project is explained in the following section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                  Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
(c) Neighborhood Upgrading:3' Improving the quality of low income neighborhoods through&#13;
the systematic, coordinated and simultaneous improvement of infrastructure services and&#13;
community facilities, particularly in Gaza and the older sections of West Bank cities where the&#13;
majority of the poor live, and where basic infrastructure and services are extremely deficient.&#13;
The most critical general constraints are the availability and predictability of investment and maintenance&#13;
funding, and the limited capacity of the local consulting and contracting industry. On the funding side,&#13;
for example, in mid-1995 PECDAR identified some US$600 million of urgent and apparently worthwhile&#13;
infrastructure investments but less than one-half of that seems likely to be funded over the next four&#13;
years.&#13;
1.10   Local Government Issues. The most critical issues in the LG sector are the following:&#13;
(a) Legal and Institutional: Clarifyipg roles and responsibility for investment planning, aid&#13;
coordination and implementation at the central level--parti. larly the respective roles of MLG,&#13;
the Ministries of Planning and InternaLonal Cooperation (MOPIC), W3rks, and Transport, and&#13;
PECDAR; clarifying the roles and functions of LG, and degree of autonomy vis-a-vis central&#13;
government; and ensuring, where roles are already clearly assigned, that the capacities,&#13;
mechanisms and information necessary to make it possible to fulfill assigned responsibilities are&#13;
developed.&#13;
(b) Fiscal and Financial: Central/lInter-Governmental Level: Ensuring that provisions are made&#13;
for the financing needs of LGs in future public sector financial projections, both for recurrent&#13;
revenue and capital investment support; developing a coherent, predictable, efficient and national-&#13;
policy-sensitive system of inter-governmental finance and revenue sharing; strengthening central&#13;
government capacity to set national investment priorities and monitor performance at both central&#13;
and local levels; and bringing donor investment project financing at the LG level under the&#13;
umbrella of the public investment program and the purview of the Ministry of Finance (MOF),&#13;
MLG and MOPIC; and LG Level: Strengthening revenue bases to ensure resources are&#13;
commensurate with current and anticipated future responsibilities; reforming current cash-based&#13;
accounting systems to ensure that they make adequate provision for allocation of costs and the&#13;
maintenance of existing assets, and accurately reflect municipal financial position and&#13;
performance; strengthening cost accounting and service pricing systems; strengthening collection&#13;
performance to overcome problems partly attributable to the Intifada: consumer reluctance to pay&#13;
for poor service delivery, undiscipline, and weak financial management; reducing dependence on&#13;
net revenues from water and electricity utility operations to help fund other municipal routine&#13;
operations; and establishing a system of capital investment financing which reduces dependence&#13;
on ad hoc transfers from central government, net revenues from water and electricity operations,&#13;
and uncertain donor support; and,&#13;
(c) Managerial and Technical: Central/lInter-Governmental Level: Strengthening investment&#13;
planning, programming and monitoring systems, and reducing over-dependence on donors&#13;
financing in establishing national priorities and programs; and strengthening organizational,&#13;
personnel, staff development and training systems; and LG Level: Strengthening service delivery,&#13;
quality, reliability and efficiency; improving the maintenance of existing assets; strengthening&#13;
3/     Strictly speaking this is a cross-sectoral issue. However, it has become obvious from on-going projects&#13;
that if a significant impact is to be made in severely neglected areas, it is necessary to go beyond the&#13;
simple rehabilitation of individual sectors to the systematic and coordinated improvement of whole&#13;
neighborhoods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                                   5&#13;
investment planning and programming and monitoring systems, and reducing over-dependence&#13;
on donor priorities in establishing LG priorities and programs; strengthening organizational,&#13;
personnel, staff development and training systems.&#13;
Apart from the availability of funding and the time required to recruit and/or train suitable staff and put&#13;
systems in place, a critical general issue is the natural desire to consolidate power at the center, often at&#13;
the expense of the older, long established LGs. This already strong tendency is reinforced by the&#13;
centralizing models in neighboring Jordan and Egypt.&#13;
IDA/Bank Group Strategy&#13;
1.11   Since 1993, IDA has been in the forefront of a broadly based donor-supported effort to assist&#13;
WBG. To this end, and working in close consultation with Palestinian counterparts, in December 1993,&#13;
IDA developed the 3-year US$1.2 billion Emergency Assistance Program (EAP) which provided the basic&#13;
investment framework in WBG.4' Ten infrastructure sectors were identified under EAP for priority&#13;
support (education; health and welfare; power; telecommunications; water, wastewater and sanitation;&#13;
roads; transport; solid waste; housing; and agriculture), at an estimated cost of $600 million. In support&#13;
of EAP, IBRD transferred US$50 million from its own surplus into the trust fund for investments in&#13;
Gaza. To date, two projects have been developed and implemented from the proceeds of the Trust Fund&#13;
for Gaza (TFG). The first, the 3-year US$128 million Emergency Rehabilitation Project (ERP, FY94)-&#13;
-a forerunner of the currently proposed project--focussed on the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure and&#13;
services in four sectors: roads; water and wastewater, education and power. The ERP was supported by&#13;
a US$30 million trust fund credit from TFG and became effective in September 1994. After a somewhat&#13;
difficult start due to local political and managerial problems (including prolonged border closures) and&#13;
some cofinancing shortfalls, it is now being satisfactorily implemented. The second project, the US$126&#13;
million Education and Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP, FY96), was supported by the remaining&#13;
US$20 million from TFG. EHRP became effective in September 1995, and is now in the early stages&#13;
of implementation. This project focusses on the rehabilitation of hospitals, health centers, clinics and&#13;
schools, and is part of a much broader program of sector support.&#13;
1.12   In recognition of the changes that have occurred in WBG since 1993 (partly spurred by EAP),&#13;
and having regard for the activities of donors and the various initiatives of the Palestinian Authority, the&#13;
predecessor of the Palestinian Council, in early 1995 the Bank Group began turning its attention to the&#13;
medium-term. Accordingly, a new infrastructure strategy was outlined. This reaffirmed the centrality&#13;
of rehabilitation of basic physical and social infrastructure, but pointed to the urgent need to begin to:&#13;
rationalize service delivery; establish the policy and institutional framework for investment sustainability&#13;
by promoting greater private sector participation in the financing of infrastructure and the delivery of&#13;
services; rationalize the public service;5' and reduce dependence on external funds to finance recurrent&#13;
costs.Y' Simultaneously, the Palestinian Authority, in consultation with the Bank Group began developing&#13;
a new Public Investment Program (PIP).Z' This Program envisages some US$1.32 billion in&#13;
investments, including some US$780 million in physical infrastructure during the 1995-98 period. After&#13;
4/     EAP was accompanied by a $30 million donor funded but Bank Group managed Technical Assistance&#13;
Trust Fund (TATF) which provided, and still provides support for TA and studies aimed at supporting&#13;
medium-term development objectives.&#13;
5/     Proposals for civil service reform are now being developed with support from TATF.&#13;
6/     To date these costs have been supported by the Bank Group managed Holst Fund, a component of&#13;
EAP.&#13;
7/     West Bank and Gaza: Outlook For Public Investment and Associated Funding Needs, July 25, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                 Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
extensive consultations between the Bank Group and the Executive Authority of the Palestinian Council&#13;
(EAPC), a set of five supporting Core Projects were agreed as follows: Municipal Infrastructure and&#13;
Development (i.e., the currently proposed project, FY96); Water and Sanitation Services (FY96, focussed&#13;
on Gaza only); Palestinian Housing and Housing Finance (FY97); Border and Local Estates (FY97); and&#13;
Electricity Sector Investment and Management (FY97).&#13;
1.13   While preparation of the Core Projects is well advanced, the severity of the current economic&#13;
crisis (para. 1.2) requires an immediate response. This is necessary to relieve unemployment, minimize&#13;
social hardship, and avoid permanent damage to the peace process. In response to the crisis, an&#13;
emergency employment generation program has been developed which would create some 80,000-person&#13;
days of employment over the next 3 to 4 months. This program would be financed by augmenting the&#13;
Hoist Fund and increasing the commitment to ERP by US$20 million. It would also be supported by&#13;
accelerating EHRP and MIDP investments, and by providing for higher than usual retroactive financing&#13;
under MIDP.8'&#13;
Project Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.14   The proposed Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (MIDP), then, is part of, and&#13;
consistent with Bank Group and EAPC investment strategy for WBG. It seeks to continue the thrusts of&#13;
ERP, but would break new ground by helping to initiate significant institutional reform and capacity&#13;
building in the LG sector.  Specific project objectives, therefore, are: (a) to help remove critical&#13;
infrastructural bottlenecks; improve essential services and facilities; preserve existing infrastructural&#13;
assets; create productive employment; and (b) to strengthen the local government system, particularly to&#13;
rationalize roles and responsibilities and build finance and managerial capacity. Particular stress would&#13;
be placed on developing an efficient, equitable and predictable system of inter-governmental revenue&#13;
sharing, strengthening LG investment and maintenance programming, preparing LGs for rationalization&#13;
of their utility operations and clarifying the role of PECDAR. In order to ensure significant impact,&#13;
husband scarce Bank Group resources and complement the work of the EAPC, other donors and other&#13;
Bank Group projects, MIDP would focus on two infrastructure sectors: Roads; and Water, Wastewater&#13;
and Sanitation. Stress would be placed on village improvements, maintenance issues and the upgrading&#13;
of low income neighborhoods.&#13;
1.15   Project and Program: Because the issues that need to be addressed are systemic and go well&#13;
beyond the confines and resources of the proposed project, a programmatic approach is proposed. Thus&#13;
the project would support, and be a core part of a much larger five-year Local Government&#13;
Development Program (LGDP) with congruent objectives and structure, and in which other donors and&#13;
UN agencies would be encouraged to participate. Both the project and the program would aim to provide&#13;
a framework for overall LG sector investment and maintenance programming as part of the overall PIP&#13;
under the jurisdiction of MOF and MOPIC. However, MOF and MOPIC do not currently have the&#13;
capacity to effectively manage the PIP. This capacity would have to be built up over the next 2-3 years&#13;
and the project would help support this. It is estimated that LGDP would encompass only about 30-40&#13;
percent of the PIP investments in the two sectors. Target program costs would thus be about US$150-170&#13;
million.29&#13;
The new strategy was sunmmarized in a note to the Board entitled "West Bank and Gaza - The World&#13;
Bank's Response to the Current Economic Crisis: An Interim Strategy", dated April 23, 1996.&#13;
9/    The project would aim to support core components of the program and to fund about one-quarter of&#13;
total program costs. Bank Group funding is not expected to exceed US$40 million. Recent experience&#13;
indicates that other program funding is unlikely to exceed three times this amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                                 7&#13;
1.16   In order to test ideas and proposals prior to system-wide adoption and to husband scarce Bank&#13;
Group resources, reforms and capacity building would be focussed initially on five key cities; Jenin,&#13;
Nablus and Hebron in the West Bank, and Gaza City and Rafah in the Gaza Strip. These cities are&#13;
chosen because of their size and/or strategic importance in their regions.f'' However, it should be noted&#13;
that investments would not be limited to these five selected cities but would be distributed on the basis&#13;
of nationally determined priorities (see para. 2.4). The project and the program would build on ongoing&#13;
reform work in the SMs (particularly Hebron and Gaza City), the current efforts of Nablus to effectively&#13;
manage infrastructure and services, and the current efforts by MLG to draft a new LG law and strengthen&#13;
management and finance in the sector.L'1 Successful reforms would later be spread system-wide, as&#13;
resources permitted.&#13;
1.17   A key part of the LG development strategy would be the initiation and support of a 2-3 year&#13;
process of stakeholder consultation and consensus building. The outputs of this process would be, inter&#13;
alia, new (or reconfirmed) allocations of roles, responsibilities and resources, and the development of&#13;
appropriate incentive structures and systems at both central and local levels. The process would be&#13;
facilitated through the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee and a set of technical&#13;
committees and working groups. These would be appropriately supported with technical assistance. It&#13;
would be illusory to expect that all of the many and complex issues can, or will be satisfactorily resolved&#13;
under the project and program. The objective here is to make a substantial treginning. Among the&#13;
specific outputs would be: a new LG law, improved investment programming systems; more efficient&#13;
and predictable inter-governmental revenue sharing system; improved accounting and financial&#13;
management systems at the local le;el; a system of routine and periodic maintenance based on clearly&#13;
established service indicators; better pricing of services; improved service delivery; and the basis for&#13;
developing regional utilities. To help guide the process and provide a basis for monitoring progress and&#13;
achievement a policy matrix and a set of development impact and output monitoring indicators have been&#13;
developed (see Annexes 10 and 14).&#13;
II. PROGRAM SUMMARY AND DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Local Govermnent Development Program Components (US$160 Million Total Program Cost)&#13;
2.1    Consistent with the objectives outlined above (paras. 1.14-1.17), the LGDP would have two main&#13;
parts (A and B) and one supporting part (C) as follows: Part A, the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and&#13;
Improvement Component (US$148 million, or 93 percent of total program cost); Part B, the Local&#13;
Government Reform and Capacity Building Component (US$7 million, or 4 percent of total program&#13;
cost); Part C, the Managerial Support &amp; Incremental Operating Expenses Component (US$5 million, or&#13;
3 percent of total program cost).&#13;
2.2    The program and the proposed project would be identically structured. However, the project&#13;
would be narrower in scope and focus (see para. 1.15) and would aim to provide particular support for&#13;
key policy objectives and those investment areas where donor support may be weak. In order to avoid&#13;
10/    The selection was done in consultation with MLG and includes a mix of weak and strong&#13;
municipalities. Jenin, Nablus, Hebron and Gaza are regional capitals, and Rafah is strategically located&#13;
on the Egyptian border near to the proposed international airport and a proposed industrial estate. The&#13;
other key cities, Ramallah and El Bireh, were omitted because of resource constraints, and because&#13;
they are part of the Jerusalem orbit and are already relatively well served.&#13;
II/    MLG is currently making efforts to standardize accounting systems in two cities, Nablus and Gaza,&#13;
with the assistance of international consultants funded by TATF.&#13;

costs is presented in Annex 5.&#13;
Project Components (US$45 Million Total Project Cost)&#13;
2.3    The MIDP components are presented below and in greater detail in Annex 5.&#13;
Part A. Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement Component (US$35.6 million, or&#13;
79 percent of total project cost)&#13;
1. Rehabilitation and Improvement Sub-Program (US$22.9 million, or 51 percent of total&#13;
project cost). Support for the rehabilitation and/or improvement of high-priority infrastructure&#13;
and services including: a) Roads: Village, Municipal, and Regional; b) Water Supply,&#13;
Wastewater and Sanitation--West Bank only: Village and Municipal; and c) Technical Assistance&#13;
for project preparation and supervision.&#13;
II. Maintenance Sub-Program (US$7.5 million, or 16 percent of total project cost). Support&#13;
for a 4-year program of routine and periodic maintenance by contract. It would include the&#13;
following components:  a) Roads: Village, Municipal, and  Regional; b) Water Supply,&#13;
Wastewater and Sanitation--West Bank only: Village and Municipal; and c) Technical Assistance&#13;
for project preparation and supervision. (Further details are presented in Annexes 5 and 6.)&#13;
Ill. Neighborhood Upgrading Sub-Program (US$5.2 million, or 12 percent of total project&#13;
cost). Support for much needed basic infrastructure and services to about 21,500 residents in&#13;
4 lower-income comnmunities in the Gaza Strip.L'' The improvements, depending on the needs&#13;
of each area, would include: a) Basic Infrastructure and Community Facilities; and b) Technical&#13;
Assistance for project preparation and supervision. (Further details are presented in Annexes&#13;
5 and 7.)&#13;
Part B. Local Government Reform and Capacity Building Component (US$7.1 million,&#13;
or 16 percent of total project cost).&#13;
I. LG Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Sub-Program (US$4.0 million, or 9 percent&#13;
of total project cost). Support for a process of reform at central and inter-governmental levels.&#13;
It would include the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Comnmittee and three&#13;
Technical Committees: (Legal and Institutional; Fiscal and Financial; and Managerial), studies,&#13;
meetings and workshops. (Further details are presented in Annexes 2, 5, 8 and 9.)&#13;
II. SM Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Sub-Program (US$3.1 million, or 7 percent&#13;
of total project cost). Support for a similar process of reform (as above) at the level of the SMs.&#13;
(Further details are presented in Annexes 3, 5, 8 and 10.)&#13;
12/   The project focusses on residential neighborhoods in Gaza but, in principle (funds permitting), could&#13;
include the older inner city commercial areas in the West Bank.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                                 9&#13;
Part C. Managerial Support &amp; Incremental Operating Expenses Component (US$2.3&#13;
million, or 5 percent of total project cost)&#13;
Support for project and program coordination, monitoring, reporting, accounting, auditing and&#13;
bulk procurement of essential goods. It would include: a) Consultants' Services; b) Training&#13;
and Studies; c) Incremental Operating Expenses; and d) Vehicles, Equipment, Materials,&#13;
Supplies and Spares. (Further details are presented in Annex 5.)&#13;
Sub-project Selection and Preparation Status&#13;
2.4     A set of core sub-projects have been identified and appraised, but some (about 20 percent) need&#13;
further study and other important potential sub-projects exist and need to be reviewed.)' In order to&#13;
respond to these and to opportunities and constraints that may arise during implementation, the project&#13;
has been designed to be both flexible and open-ended. Thus, during implementation and with the prior&#13;
approval of IDA, already identified sub-projects may be replaced with other feasible high-priority sub-&#13;
projects. To facilitate this flexibility while ensuring objectivity, transparency, and that only high priority&#13;
sub-projects qualify for support, a set of selection criteria have been agreed as follows: a) economic and&#13;
technical feasibility; b) readiness for implementation; c) environmental impact; d) consistency with&#13;
program and project objectives and short-term sector strategies as outlined in paras. 1.11 - 1. 17 and&#13;
Annex 1; e) community social and/or economic priority; f) economic and social impact; g) distributional&#13;
equity; and h) avoidance of unaffordable recurrent cost commitments. These criteria would be further&#13;
developed in the Fiscal and Financial and Managerial Technical Committees (para. 2.3, Part B (II)).&#13;
They would be operationalized by MLG in consultation with PECDAR and IDA, and would be fairly,&#13;
explicitly and transparently applied.f' The evaluation of sub-projects would be clearly documented in&#13;
quarterly reports to IDA.  The detailed schedule for sub-project implementation was agreed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
Enviromnental Aspects&#13;
2.5     The Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B" consistent with the&#13;
provisions of Operational Directive 4.01. All sub-projects would be subject to screening for potential&#13;
environmental impacts, resettlement issues and the protection of cultural heritage, consistent with local&#13;
regulatory requirements and those of IDA. They would also be supervised during implementation by&#13;
environmental specialists and representatives of the Environmental Planning Directorate (EPD) for the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and the Palestinian Department of Archaeology (PDA)&#13;
of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Formal clearances would be obtained from the EPD and&#13;
PDA for all sub-projects proposed for funding under the Project, consistent with current Palestinian&#13;
environmental and cultural heritage procedures.  No resettlement is anticipated and no known&#13;
archaeological or historical sites are anticipated to be affected by activities to be supported under the&#13;
proposed project. However, given the high density of archaeological and historical sites in the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza, provisions will be made in construction contracts for the use of "chance find" procedures&#13;
should archaeological or historical materials be discovered in the course of project implementation. In&#13;
order to support effective implementation of the proposed project, a series of three-day training courses&#13;
13/    A total of 185 projects valued at US$285 million were reviewed. The projects to be implemented in&#13;
year 1 are either ready, or will be ready, for tendering in June 1996. Year 2 projects will be ready for&#13;
tendering by January 1997. See Annex 11 for details. See also paras. 4.1 - 4.7 and Annex 18 for&#13;
discussion of Economic Assessment issues.&#13;
14/    All program participants would be encouraged to use these criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                              Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
on the application of the Bank's procedures for environmental assessment, resettlement and cultural&#13;
heritage would be conducted in cooperation with EPD, PDA and the implementing agencies.&#13;
Program Objective Categories&#13;
2.6    The project would support the Palestinian effort to alleviate poverty, build institutional capacity,&#13;
improve and protect the environment, and create an enabling environment for sustainable private sector&#13;
development.  Specifically, in the short run, the Infrastructure, Rehabilitation and Improvement&#13;
component and, within this, the Maintenance and Urban Upgrading sub-programs particularly, will&#13;
generate a significant number of lower skilled jobs at the municipal and village levels where poverty is&#13;
most widespread. This component should also help preserve public assets, create opportunities for private&#13;
consultants, contractors and suppliers.&#13;
III. PROJECT COSTS, INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.1    The total program (LGDP) cost is estimated at US$160 million. Program cofinancing is being&#13;
sought from donors but only about US$40 million has been tentatively pledged to date. The total project&#13;
(MIDP) cost is estimated at US$45 million net of taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$19&#13;
million or about 42 percent of total costs. Base cost estimates are calculated using January 1996 prices.&#13;
The physical contingencies represent 10 percent of base costs. Price contingencies are derived from&#13;
expected foreign price increases of an average 3 percent per annum, in accordance with Bank/IDA&#13;
guidelines, over the four-year implementation period beginning on July 1, 1996. The EAPC (MOF,&#13;
MLG and the Municipalities) would contribute US$5 million (about 11 percent of total project cost),&#13;
particularly to maintenance programming. A WBG Trust Fund credit of US$40 million equivalent on&#13;
standard IDA terms would finance 89 percent of total costs. Retroactive financing of a maximum of 20&#13;
percent of the Credit has been provided for works and studies undertaken prior to project effectiveness&#13;
(para. 1.13). This provision has been made in order to support the emergency employment program.&#13;
The cost tables and financing plan for tie project and the program are presented in Annex 11.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements and Responws0bilities&#13;
3.2    The PLO would be the Borrower for the benefit of the Palestinian Council (acting through&#13;
EAPC) as mandated by the Interim Agreement of September 1995, and would enter into a Subsidiary&#13;
Agreement with EAPC with respec: to the implementation of the prc,ect. Execution of the Agreement&#13;
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness. The project would be&#13;
implemented over a four-year period beginning July 1996, and ending June 30, 2000. The Closing Date&#13;
would be December 31, 2000. The Implementation Responsibility Matrix, and Organization and Flow&#13;
Charts are presented in Annex 12. The Implementation Schedule is presented in Annex 13. Project&#13;
implementation arrangements are summarized below.&#13;
3.3   Policy and Program  Guidance and Coordination: Overall Policy, Program and Project&#13;
Guidance would be provided by an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC), a subcommittee of the&#13;
EAPC comprising: the Ministers of Finance, Local Government, Planning, Justice (MOJ), Transport,&#13;
Works or their nominees; the Chairman of the PWA or his/her nominee; the Managing Director of&#13;
PECDAR or his/her nominee; and a representative from each of the SMs. A chairman would be selected&#13;
by the EAPC from among the group. The IMSC would be established by July 31, 1996 (i.e., about 2&#13;
months prior to the proposed LG elections) in order to provide inputs and guidance to MLG in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                                    11&#13;
drafting of the new Local Government Law on which the elections will be based. MLG would act as a&#13;
secretariat to IMSC. To provide guidelines for the process at the central level, a Matrix has been agreed&#13;
(see Annex 9), based on MLG's policy for the development of the sector. The latter is sununarized in&#13;
a Letter of Sector Policy which was discussed at negotiations (see Annex 4). Consistent with project&#13;
objectives (see para. 1.15) and in order to ensure that MOF can begin to play a central role in LG&#13;
investment programming, funding would flow through this ministry.'5'&#13;
3.4    Project Implementation:  Given the objectives of the project, MLG would be responsible for&#13;
sector policy formulation and management, with the exception of the regional roads component which&#13;
would be the responsibility of MOT/MOW. Since the above ministries have little implementation&#13;
capacity at present, they draw upon the capacity already built up in PECDAR under ERP. Part A of the&#13;
project would thus be implemented by PECDAR in consultation with MLG and MOT/MOW. However,&#13;
SMs would be responsible for their components, i.e., works located within their jurisdictions. Part B,&#13;
including the establishment and operations of technical committees, would be undertaken by MLG, again&#13;
with the components at the local level being undertaken by the SMs. Part C would be undertaken by&#13;
PECDAR on behalf of and in consultation with the sector ministries.'L` The following table provides a&#13;
summnary of the implementation arrangements for project components:&#13;
Part A:&#13;
*  Rehabilitation and Improvement   MLG (all except Regional Roads);  PECDAR in consultation with MLG,&#13;
Sub-program                  MOT/MOW (Regional Roads)      MOT/MOW (except SMs' components);&#13;
SMs responsible for their components&#13;
* Maintenance Sub-program       MLG (all except Regional Roads);   Municipalities in consultation with&#13;
MLG; SMs for their components;&#13;
MOT/MOW (Regional Roads)      MOT/MOW responsible for or assists&#13;
with others&#13;
* Upgrading Sub-program         MLG                            In SMs, SMs in consultation with MLG&#13;
Outside SMs, PECDAR in consultation&#13;
with MLG&#13;
Part B                          MLG                            MLG; SMs responsible for their own&#13;
components, but MLG assists&#13;
Part C                          MLG, MOT/MOW, and MOF          PECDAR in consultation with MLG,&#13;
MOT/MOW and MOF&#13;
15/    In order to streamline project implementation arrangements, MOF would not be directly involved in&#13;
managing project funds. However, as a critical party in LG investment programming and overall&#13;
system development, they would sign the initial disbursement request and PECDAR will sign&#13;
subsequent replenishment requests and submit them to IDA through the Ministry of Finance. They&#13;
would be kept informed by PECDAR of progress of investments and expenditure of funds and would&#13;
be provided with quarterly progress reports and financial statements (see paras 3.4 to 3.12). With this&#13;
information, MOF would be able to maintain a control account for the project and review consistency&#13;
with policy and program objectives.&#13;
16/    These arrangements would be detailed in Implementation Agreements.&#13;
17/    See also Annexes 8-10 for details on Part "B".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                             Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
3.5    Unlike ERP, in MIDP, PECDAR would not have a completely independent role, but, given its&#13;
expertise, would provide support to other project agencies.  This would be done on the basis of&#13;
Implementation Agreements which would specify the duties and obligations of the respective parties.&#13;
Two Implementation Agreements are proposed: one between EAPC and PECDAR, and the other between&#13;
EAPC and each of the five SMs. These Agreements would be reviewed on an annual basis and, if&#13;
mutually decided, suitably modified subject to IDA 's approval. Execution of Implementation Agreements&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be conditions of effectiveness. In order to ensure that PECDAR can play its&#13;
role effectively, it will be reorganized, and it has been agreed that PECDAR would submit a suitable&#13;
reorganization program, including a time-bound action plan, to IDA by November 30, 1996. It has been&#13;
further agreed that PECDAR would enter into dialogue with IDA on the implementation of this program.&#13;
To coordinate its responsibilities under the project, the MLG would establish a special committee of its&#13;
directors. This Project Coordination Committee (PCC) would report directly to the Deputy Minister, and&#13;
would draw upon the services of existing MLG departments. The PCC would be provided with full-time&#13;
technical and administrative support by 3-4 well qualified LG management and finance professionals, and&#13;
by 3 full-time consultants. The latter would be financed under the project. Finally, to ensure flexibility&#13;
in the face of uncertain and rapidly changing circumstances, the structure of the project and the&#13;
implementation arrangements would be reviewed at formal, joint half-yearly review meetings between&#13;
IDA and IMSC. A formal mid-term review would also be jointly undertaken, with similar objectives.&#13;
During these meetings, steps necessary to ensure effective project implementation and ensure the&#13;
attainment of project objectives would be agreed, including, if necessary, steps to restructure and refocus&#13;
the project and the program. To help provide a framework for project monitoring and review, a set of&#13;
output and impact indicators were agreed at negotiations. These are presented in Annex 14.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.6   Procurement methods for works, goods and services to be financed under the proposed Credit&#13;
have been agreed and are summarized in Annex 15. PECDAR, in consultation with MLG and&#13;
MOT/MOW, would be responsible for procuring works and technical assistance under Part A, however,&#13;
SMs would be responsible for procurement of their components (para. 3.4). MLG would be responsible&#13;
for procurement under Part B, however, SMs again would be responsible for their own component.&#13;
Drawing on its experience, PECDAR would provide technical support to the other agencies on matters&#13;
relating to contracts, bidding, Bank guidelines, etc., as well as be responsible, in consultation with MLG&#13;
and MOT/MOW, for procurement under Part C. PECDAR also would be responsible for overall&#13;
monitoring of the procurement process. Because of the urgent nature of the project, part of the&#13;
procurement would be undertaken using simplified competitive bidding procedures in accordance with&#13;
IDA Guidelines. Similar procedures were used in ERP and proved to be satisfactory and efficient. All&#13;
equipment, materials, works and services to be financed under the project jointly, or solely, by IDA&#13;
would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995 and as revised&#13;
in January 1996) and Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank As Executing Agency (August 1981).&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.7   PECDAR would be responsible for managing disbursements. Given the urgent nature of the&#13;
proposed project, the implementation period would be 48 months. Disbursements are expected to begin&#13;
on July 1, 1996 and be completed by December 31, 2000, which will be the closing date. The proposed&#13;
WBG Trust Fund credit of US$40 million equivalent would be disbursed against the main categories&#13;
stated below as follows: i) 100 percent of total costs in years 1 and 2 and 75 percent in years 3 and 4&#13;
for Works: (US$25.6 million); ii) 100 percent of total costs for Vehicles, Equipment, Materials, Supplies&#13;
and Spares (US$1.3 million); iii) 100 percent of the total costs for Technical Assistance, Consultant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                          13&#13;
Services, Studies and Training (US$8.8 million); iv) 100 percent of total costs in years 1 and 2 and 75&#13;
percent in years 3 and 4 for Incremental Operating Expenses (US$0.3 million); v) Unallocated (US$4.0&#13;
million).LA' The very high disbursement percentages are justified by the current financial constraints in&#13;
WBG. Details of disbursement categories and estimated quantity disbursements are presented in Annex&#13;
15.&#13;
3.8   Special Account. In order to facilitate quick disbursements, a Special Account (SA) would be&#13;
established by MOF who would also sign the initial disbursement request. However, PECDAR would&#13;
be designated by MOF to manage and operate the SA, and subsequent replenishment requests and&#13;
withdrawal applications would be signed by PECDAR and submitted to IDA through MOF.&#13;
3.9   The authorized allocations, representing about three to four months of project expenditures, would&#13;
be US$4.0 million. However, the initial deposit to the SA would be limited to US$2.0 million until&#13;
disbursements have reached about 20 percent of amount of the Credit. The SA would be maintained in&#13;
US Dollars in a reputable commercial bank, and be operated on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.&#13;
On a monthly basis, or when one-half of the SA deposit has been utilized, replenishment requests will&#13;
be submitted to IDA with the necessary supporting documentation including monthly bank statement of&#13;
funds withdrawn from the SA. Disbursements would be fully documented, except for disbursements&#13;
against contracts for works and goods valued below US$250,000, US$100,000 for consulting contracts&#13;
with firms and US$50,000 for consulting contracts with individuals and for works carried out under force&#13;
account for which the supporting documentation would be retained for subsequent review by local IDA&#13;
supervisory staff or visiting IDA supervision missions.&#13;
Accounting, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
3.10   As noted above (para 3.3), the proceeds of the Credit would be passed on through MOF to&#13;
PECDAR who would be responsible for overall project monitoring, accounting, reporting and auditing&#13;
(para. 3.4 and Annex 12).&#13;
3.11   The following accounting and auditing arrangements are agreed: i) Project Accounts: that&#13;
consolidated accounts would be maintained by PECDAR on a basis satisfactory to IDA for all components&#13;
of the project; and ii) Audits: the project accounts, including the Special Account and all disbursements&#13;
against SOEs would be audited separately and on an annual basis by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA and submitted annually to IDA no later than six months after the end of each financial year. In&#13;
order to ensure maintenance of annual accounts on a satisfactory basis and timely completion of final&#13;
accounts, PECDAR would be staffed with suitably qualified accountants si,pported by appropriate&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
3.12   The following arrangements for proivct monitoring and reporting are agreed: that PECDAR acting&#13;
in close consultation with MLG, MOF, Tv 91/MOW and the SMs. would provide, on a quarterly basis,&#13;
consolidated reports on project implemen. jtnn progress covering: (i, projections for project financing&#13;
and implementation; (ii) the status of project finances, procurement of consulting services, goods and&#13;
works; (iii) training; (iv) incremental operating expenses and vehicles and equipment components; (v)&#13;
statements of income and expenditure for the current and previous quarters; and (vi) monthly cash flow&#13;
projections for the next two quarters. Any major variances from budget would be explained and&#13;
corrective measures proposed. These reports would be submitted to IDA within one month of the end&#13;
of the relevant quarter, and would provide the basis for monitoring the progress of the project and for&#13;
discussions at the formal joint half-yearly reviews (and a formal mid-term review) by IDA and IMSC (see&#13;
18/   Costs are net of taxes and duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                  Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
para. 3.5). The half-yearly reviews would be conducted no later than March 31 and September 30 every&#13;
year. In preparation for these reviews, PECDAR would submit annual and mid-year project progress&#13;
reports to IDA no later than four weeks before the date of the half-yearly joint reviews.&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Economic Analysis'9&#13;
4.1    The economic evaluation reviewed the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement component&#13;
of the project (Part A) representing 79 percent of total project cost (US$35.6 million). The three sub-&#13;
components of Part A have been analyzed separately:  (a) the Rehabilitation and Improvement&#13;
Sub-Program (US$29.9 million); (b) the Maintenance Sub-Program (US$7.5 million); and (c) the&#13;
Neighborhood Upgrading Sub-Program (US$5.2 million).&#13;
4.2    Rehabilitation and Improvement Sub-Program. Given the substantial size of the originally&#13;
identified Palestinian investment program (numerous sub-projects estimated at US$600 million) and the&#13;
limited available time, data and financial resources, it was critical to establish a feasible system for&#13;
screening proposed projects to derive a refined list. The strategy adopted was to establish a hierarchy&#13;
of filters through which proposals would have to pass in order to be accepted and an efficient process by&#13;
which to carry out the review (See Annex 18 for a detailed discussion of the economic analysis&#13;
methodology and results). Thefirstfilter was the state of preparation of the projects; only projects that&#13;
would be ready for implementation within 18 months were considered. The secondfilter was to eliminate&#13;
projects already being considered by other donors. These filters reduced the size of the proposed&#13;
program to be evaluated by the Bank to US$260 million--still considerably beyond available resources.&#13;
The next filter was an acceptable economic rate of return (ERR). The minimum ERR was set at&#13;
14 percent; the cost of capital for WBG is estimated by the Country Economist at 10 percent, however,&#13;
given the large number of projects proposed, it was desirable to raise the hurdle to ensure that the highest&#13;
value cohort would be considered for further analyses. The investments under the Rehabilitation and&#13;
Improvement sub-component which represents 60 percent of total project cost thus have been selected to&#13;
ensure a minimum of 14 percent ERR.&#13;
4.3    The analysis involved the development and testing of three analytic approaches (for water,&#13;
wastewater and roads) that enabled rapid classification and testing of proposals. For water supply,&#13;
investments were divided into three categories: (a) creation or expansion of water network; (b) pumps&#13;
and reservoirs; and (c) rehabilitation/upgrading of network. The benefits assessed were: (i) provision&#13;
of piped water; (ii) increase in property value; (iii) increased provision of water; and (iv) reduction of&#13;
water losses through the network. Out of the 50 proposed projects, 39, costing a total of US$15.8&#13;
million met the threshold condition of 14 percent ERR. Sensitivity analyses indicate that increased project&#13;
costs of 10 percent would reduce the number of acceptable projects by 2, costing US$1.2 million.&#13;
Decreasing at the same time project benefits by 10 percent would eliminate 8 projects, totalling US$2.8&#13;
million. Wastewater investments in treatment plants, sewage networks and pumping stations provide&#13;
benefits in terms of health improvements, positive environmental impact and increases in property values.&#13;
Household willingness to pay for direct benefits and public revenues for spill-over benefits necessary to&#13;
ensure the threshold 14 percent ERR, estimated as up to a ceiling of US$36 per capita, per year, were&#13;
used to filter project proposals. Ten out of 32 proposed projects costing US$23.5 million met this&#13;
criterion. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a 20 percent increase in project costs and a 5 percent increase&#13;
19/    The analysis included far more projects than could be accomrnodated in the project. These projects&#13;
would be included in the program for support by donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Development Project                                                15&#13;
in O&amp;M costs would eliminate two projects Road investments would improve surface conditions, road&#13;
safety and reduce time spent on transpuit bienefits were quantified in terms of vehicle user savings and&#13;
time savings. Projects were classified into categories according to the kind of road and the type of work&#13;
to be done. For each suh-project, it was estimated based on its cost, the average daily traffic and&#13;
standard conditions related to the project category, whether it met the 14 percent minimum ERR. Ninety-&#13;
eight of 110 projects costing US$108 million met the economic criterion. Sensitivity analysis revealed&#13;
that decreasing the average daily traffic by 10 percent and increasing project costs by the same proportion&#13;
would eliminate 2 projects. Reducing traffic growth from 4 to 0 peicent would eliminate 6 projects.&#13;
4.4    Other criteria used in assessing projects which passed the ERR test included: projects should&#13;
respond to community social priorities; they should be confirmed by local authorities as being of high&#13;
priority to them; and, institutional arrangements for operation and maintenance should be in place.&#13;
Special attention should be given to geographical distribution equity; technical feasibility and consistency&#13;
with related projects should be assured, environmental impact and health factors should be assessed as&#13;
positive. These projects selected under the Project also passed these tests. The methodology and&#13;
approaches used in this analysis is being refined and will be transferred to MLG and PECDAR for iteir&#13;
use during the project.&#13;
4.5    Maintenance Sub-Program. The maintenance program has not identified specific assets to be&#13;
maintained, therefore no rate of return could be estimated for this component. However, experience in&#13;
other Bank/IDA projects indicates that maintenance activities have high rates of return and a major impact&#13;
both on the quality of services provided and municipal finance through savings. An effective maintenance&#13;
program is currently functioning in Nazareth (an Arab town in the north of Israel). This town was taken&#13;
as an example to show some of the benefits to be expected from maintenance programs. The replacement&#13;
of meters there contribute savings of approximately US$26,000 per year, which represents 7 percent of&#13;
current revenues from water bills. Effectively maintaining the road network postpones investment and&#13;
saves US$12,000 on average per kilometer in present value terms, for the municipality.&#13;
4.6    Neighborhood Upgrading Sub-Program.!' The upgrading of 48 ha. in Gaza City and Rafah will&#13;
improve the provision of needed basic services for approximately 3,000 lower-income households.&#13;
Benefits have been quantified in terms of increases in property values as a result of the improved&#13;
conditions and services. These increases average 18 percent of the value of a typical apartment (from&#13;
US$20,700 to US$24,450). The resulting rate of return on upgrading is calculated at 20 percent.&#13;
Sensitivity analyses indicate that with 10 percent reduction in property values in target and comparable&#13;
areas, the ERR would be reduced to 14 percent; with 10 percent increase in capital investment costs, the&#13;
ERR would be 15 percent.&#13;
4.7    Validation of Analysis. While the analysis revealed that most sub-projects yielded acceptable&#13;
rates of return, the quality of some of the data on which the analysis is based leaves much to be desired.&#13;
It is thus proposed to incorporate validation surveys as an integral and ongoing part of the project&#13;
implementation and review process (see Annexes 14 and 18 for details). Data from these surveys will&#13;
provide vital inputs into future project selection.&#13;
20/    The analysis included far more projects than could be accommodated in the project. These projects&#13;
would be included in the program for support by donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                  Municipal Infrastructure Development Project&#13;
Benefits and Risks&#13;
4.8    Benefits. The project would have a particularly positive impact on employment: an estimated&#13;
3,500 man-years of direct employment in construction would be created. Further, by helping to improve&#13;
the delivery of essential infrastructural services, the project would provide other significant and&#13;
widespread social and economic benefits. Specifically, it would help: improve public health and&#13;
education services; protect and conserve sensitive and limited water resources, and reduce the losses due&#13;
to network inadequacies and inefficient utility operations; make a start in improving roads, reducing&#13;
traffic congestion, travel time, and vehicle operating costs; and improve the general quality of life for&#13;
broad segments of the population as well as overall economic efficiencies. The project would also help&#13;
rationalize and strengthen both central and local institutions; mobilize local initiative and resources&#13;
reducing dependence on central budgets and authorities; improve resource allocation; open up&#13;
opportunities for private sector participation and development through consulting, contracting, and&#13;
manufacturing inputs; and help lay the foundation for sustainable development. The benefits would&#13;
accrue to virtually all citizens of WBG and particularly to low income families.&#13;
4.9    Risks. MIDP faces considerable risks, many of which cannot be avoided. These risks fall into&#13;
two broad categories: (a) Political and Institutional Risks: the success of the project requires stability&#13;
in WBG, steady progress in the bilateral negotiations, maturation of internal political processes. It also&#13;
requires the successful completion of local elections and the careful crafting of central and local&#13;
government incentive structures so that they are positively and mutually supportive. Instability and/or&#13;
Israeli/Palestinian negotiation delays could significantly slow activities which depend on their outcome&#13;
and increase project costs and the wrong incentive structure could make efficient LG reform impossible.&#13;
(b) Managerial and Technical Risks: Effective and timely implementation of the project requires the&#13;
early consideration by the EAPC of measures to strengthen the SMs, MLG and the other implementation&#13;
agencies, and the early rationalization of PECDAR. Effective and timely implementation also requires&#13;
strengthening the capacity of the local consulting and contracting industry. Political and institutional risks&#13;
would be significant and difficult to manage. On the other hand, success in providing tangible benefits&#13;
to the Palestinian population could be expected to reinforce the momentum for peace. Institutional Risks&#13;
would be minimized through dialogue, negotiation, extensive review of options, and careful attention to&#13;
the structuring of incentives at all levels. Managerial and technical risks would be minimized by&#13;
allocating as much responsibility as possible to municipalities and supporting these institutions with&#13;
competent local and foreign consultants, and by rationalizing and strengthening PECDAR. Risks would&#13;
also be minimized by establishing effective project screening and selection mechanisms in MLG, SMs&#13;
and PECDAR, and by employing competent local and foreign consultants to review and help weed out&#13;
badly, conceived or designed sub-projects. Furthermore, the project has been specifically designed to&#13;
permit flexibility during implementation including the restructuring of key components, if necessary.&#13;
Finally, risks would be minimized by establishing appropriate monitoring, reporting and control&#13;
mechanisms, intensive on-ground IDA review and support.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Infrastructure Sector Background, Issues and Strategy&#13;
1.    The MIDP focuses on rehabilitation and improvement in two infrastructure sectors: Roads, and&#13;
Water, Wastewater and Sanitation (the latter in the West Bank only). It also focuses on the trans-sectoral&#13;
problems of poor, under-serviced neighborhoods. A brief description of the sectors including issues and&#13;
proposed strategies is presented below. The accompanying matrices summarize key issues and strategies.&#13;
The key themes are a history of financial and managerial neglect, poor service delivery and weak&#13;
institutions.&#13;
Roads&#13;
(a) Regional Roads and Road Transport&#13;
2.    Background: The regional roads system of WBG consists of about 2000 km of roads in the West&#13;
Bank and 168 km in the Gaza strip. Except for short sections serving Israeli settlers, the network is&#13;
generally in poor condition. Since 1967, there has only been limited extension to the network, and the&#13;
ratio of road length to population is lower than any country in the region, except Egypt. Congestion is&#13;
therefore a considerable problem, and is particularly severe on the Gaza network and in the&#13;
JeninlNablus/Ramallah/AI Bireh/Jerusalem/Hebron corridor.  On the West Bank, the main network&#13;
serving the major population centers--largely constructed before 1967--is about 700 km in length. It&#13;
consists of two main north-south corridors'' and secondary east-west corridors. The rest of the secondary&#13;
network, about 500 km in total length, is also oriented north-south and east-west. In the Gaza Strip the&#13;
main road system consists of a 45 km north-south corridor connecting the four larger cities (Gaza,&#13;
Jaballia, Khan Younis, and Rafah), and to Israel in the north and Egypt in the south. It is severely&#13;
deteriorated but still passable for traffic. There is also an old coastal road that could potentially serve&#13;
through traffic, but it needs to be reconstructed.  The wisdom of using it for this purpose is&#13;
environmentally questionable however.&#13;
3.    Large sections of the regional roads system in the West Bank remain under the control of the&#13;
Israeli Civil Administration. On the limited segments now under the jurisdiction of the EAPC, there is&#13;
a problem of responsibility, with MOT/MOW and PECDAR all claiming some jurisdiction. Also, chronic&#13;
under-expenditure on maintenance has left key sections serving Palestinian communities in a poor&#13;
condition, with pavements in some places on the brink of disintegration. Annual expenditure on roads&#13;
during occupation is not known with any precision. It may have been as high as US$15 million per year,&#13;
but a significant portion of it was spent on roads leading to Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza&#13;
or for resurfacing of main roads in the vicinity of such settlements. Some was also spent on municipal&#13;
roads, leaving little for maintenance of the rest of the regional network. In 1995 a modest start was made&#13;
under ERP to reconstruct selected high priority sections of the network. Also, PECDAR have recently&#13;
undertaken studies of significant sections of the main network in the West Bank and the Gaza strip with&#13;
a view to rehabilitation.&#13;
1/    The eastern north-south corridor going through the Jordan Valley is mainly used by Israeli traffic.&#13;

4.     Road transport is the only passenger mode currently available in WBG, and is completely&#13;
privatized. It consists of buses; shared taxis; and unlicensed private cars, mini-vans and pick-ups which&#13;
provide services mainly in remote areas and densely populated centers as licensed vehicles cannot&#13;
adequately meet the demand. Due to the underdevelopment of the formal financial sector, term financing&#13;
was not generally available to bus companies, placing a constraint on fleet renewal and proper&#13;
maintenance. Also, due to ease of entry and lax regulation, competition from unlicensed cars further&#13;
reduced the revenues and contributed to their current weak financial position.&#13;
5.     Freight is also exclusively carried by privately-owned trucking companies, and about 20,000&#13;
trucks of various sizes are in operation. Trucking enterprises face financial problems similar to those&#13;
facing bus companies. Most of the trucking fleet is old and costly to operate. The industry is not well&#13;
organized and lacks modern terminal facilities. The system is bedeviled by delays at border crossings&#13;
caused primarily by Israeli security concerns. These delays have become much worse over the last year&#13;
because of repeated and prolonged closures.  Also, time-consuming inspection and transhipment&#13;
procedures have been introduced at the Gaza border crossings, greatly adding to delay, the financial&#13;
burdens of transport enterprises and the cost of goods. These measures have had a crippling impact on&#13;
the Gaza economy. Recent efforts have been made by Israeli authorities to streamline procedures and&#13;
a new transhipment point has been built in Carney. Despite this, the impact on Gaza remains very&#13;
severe.&#13;
6.     Issues and Strategy: The key sector issues are: lack of clear Palestinian jurisdiction over large&#13;
segments of the regional road network; the state of and rate of deterioration of the existing road network;&#13;
congestion on key sections of the network, with associated air pollution, travel time losses and high&#13;
vehicle operating costs; poor accessibility to villages; lack of attention to system maintenance; lack of&#13;
clearly defined responsibility for the road system; lack of institutional capacity and capability to plan,&#13;
manage and maintain the road network; repeated closures by Israeli authorities; and costly and time-&#13;
consuming inspection and transhipment procedures.&#13;
7.     The short-term strategy is to: (a) clarify the roles and responsibilities of the ministries and&#13;
agencies active in the sector; (b) develop and begin implementation of a 4-year road stabilization program&#13;
to establish regular routine and periodic maintenance and to eliminate the road maintenance backlog;&#13;
(c) undertake studies to determine the appropriate structure for planning, managing and regulating&#13;
transport subsectors and, on the basis of these, establish the nucleus of a road administration; (d) develop&#13;
and launch training programs to enhance the capacity of local consultants to undertake highway planning&#13;
and design, and contractors to undertake road maintenance and rehabilitation; (e) undertake studies to&#13;
improve the passenger and freight transport system, including measures to increase mobility between the&#13;
West Bank and Gaza; and (f) improving the inspection and transhipment procedures at the Israel/Gaza&#13;
checkpoints.&#13;
8.     The medium/long-term strategy is to: (a) establish institutions to develop effective sector policy&#13;
and planning, and to manage and adequately fund preservation of the road system assets; (b) develop the&#13;
Gaza port to reduce dependence on the road system for transport of goods; and (c) implement projects&#13;
to improve inter-urban passenger and freight transport, including movements between the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza by surface and air transport.&#13;

(b) Municipal and Village Roads&#13;
9.     Background:  No reliable data exist on the extent or condition of the urban road network as a&#13;
whole. However, the data available and limited visual inspections indicate that municipal road systems&#13;
have been severely neglected. Roads are in a generally poor state of repair and are often without&#13;
adequate basic drainage. With respect to villages, accessibility is a critical problem for many, particularly&#13;
on the West Bank; and the internal village road system has been especially neglected. The roads system&#13;
in the refugee camps also pose difficult problems because, surface conditions aside, reservations are often&#13;
inadequate and drainage highly problematic in some areas. Drainage and sewage problems are&#13;
particularly acute in Gaza, where many roads, including some of the major roads serving Gaza City&#13;
(Salah Edin and Zaitoon roads) are often impassable during the rainy season (December to March) due&#13;
to flooding by a combination of sewage and surface water--as much as one meter deep in some areas.&#13;
Furthermore, the inadequate or haphazard provision of other infrastructural services (water, electricity,&#13;
telephone, etc.) complicate matters and make rehabilitation and improvement an expensive and time-&#13;
consuming proposition.  Recognizing these problems, a few murnicipalities are beginning to take&#13;
corrective action. MOPIC ha&amp; recently completed a structure plan for Gaza city, and plans are being&#13;
prepared for many others.&#13;
10.   Issues and strategy   The key issues are: inadequate network development; inadequate&#13;
accessibility, particularly to WLst Bank .ilages and in refugee camps; traffic congestion and resulting&#13;
long travel times; neglect of traffic management; high accident rates; poor drainage, and consequent&#13;
frequent flooding and flood damage; poor surface conditions, due partially to neglect of maintenance;&#13;
lack of investment programming and attention to cost recovery; anc weak municipal capacity and&#13;
capability to plan, finance, operate and maintain the system.&#13;
11.   The short-term strategy is to: (a) focus initially, but not exclusively, on improving conditions&#13;
in the largest and most densely populated municipalities; (b) provide villages with improved access to the&#13;
main and regional road systems and expand the current local road network, where justified; (c) develop&#13;
urban structure and strategic traffic and transport plans for the major municipalities, including realistic&#13;
and economically justified investment programming; (d) implement traffic management sclbemes to relieve&#13;
congestion, and to improve flows and safety at major traffic bottlenecks through improved signalization,&#13;
channelization, road-signage and marking; and (e) develop and implement a coordinated program to&#13;
rehabilitate, improve and systematically maintain existing main and secondary municipal roads and drains&#13;
in municipalities and villages, with special emphasis on maintenance by contract, job creation and&#13;
community participation.&#13;
12.   The medium/long-term strategy is to: (a) extend the improvement program to all municipalities&#13;
and to the larger villages; (b) widen the program to upgrade and extend the village access road network;&#13;
and (c) to promote LG reform and capacity building and to thereby improve service delivery levels,&#13;
investment programming and cost recovery (see Annex 2).&#13;
Water Supply, Wastewater and Sanitation&#13;
13.   Background: Almost all the urban population and perhaps 70% of the rural population is served&#13;
with piped drinking water, primarily from wells, supplemented in some cases by supplies from&#13;
MEKOROT, the Israeli Water Company. Service quality is poor; and while water quality generally&#13;
meets drinking water standards, the quantity available (about 60 I/cap/day) is inadequate to meet the basic&#13;
needs of the population. Water is expensive to pump from deep aquifers and to purchase from the Israeli&#13;
system. Efficiency is low (unaccounted for water exceeds 50% of supply) and cost recovery is poor&#13;
(30-40 % of bills unpaid)--both indicative of weak management and inadequate maintenance. Also, many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
villages lack a piped water supply; few municipalities in the West Bank have adequate sources of water;&#13;
and over drawal of the Gaza aquifer threatens the resource and has contributed to severe water quality&#13;
problems. Furthermore, fragmentation is great: water and wastewater services are currently provided&#13;
by numerous separate local governments (municipalities and village councils) and by two regional utilities.&#13;
With respect to wastewater, less than half the urban area is sewered, and untreated or inadequately treated&#13;
wastewater presents serious health and environmental risks. A few municipalities have wastewater&#13;
collection systems but only about 60% of houses are connected. Moreover, the few treatment plants that&#13;
exist have generally failed to operate as designed. In most cases, sewage is discharged untreated into&#13;
wadis; irrigation re-use schemes remain unutilized; septic tanks &amp; cesspools are infrequently desludged;&#13;
and septage disposal is haphazard.&#13;
14.    The extreme water resources limitations facing Palestinian authorities, among the most serious&#13;
in the world today, demand a much better level of water resources management. The shared nature of&#13;
the three aquifers underlying the West Bank necessitates agreement with the Israeli authorities on the&#13;
management of the resources--the subject of future negotiations and the source of considerable&#13;
uncertainty. At the heart of the problem of resource management has been a fragmented institutional&#13;
structure which did not provide an adequate framework or incentives. However, the recent establishment&#13;
of the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and the anticipated passage of legislation empowering the PWA&#13;
has provided the basis for developing a sound policy and regulatory framework for the sector. It should&#13;
also help rationalize the sector and contribute to improving service delivery.  A very recent&#13;
PWA-sponsored development is the proposal to consolidate the technical management of the individual&#13;
water utilities in Gaza under the aegis of management consultants supported on the proposed,&#13;
Bank-supported Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza (see SAR para 1.12). It is hoped that this&#13;
initiative will lead over time to the full consolidation of the individual municipal water utilities.&#13;
15.   Issues and Strategy: The key sector issues are:  improving water resource management--&#13;
particularly management and regulation of the highly sensitive Gaza aquifer; improving water supply&#13;
delivery systems; improving coverage, quality and reliability in municipalities and villages; preserving&#13;
scarce resources by reducing the incidence of leakage in existing networks; improving environmental&#13;
health conditions through improving wastewater collection, treatment and disposal; improving wastewater&#13;
resource management through increased recycling; improving the overall efficiency of the utilities--&#13;
currently fragmented among many individual municipalities--through consolidation, commercialization&#13;
and privatization; and protecting Palestinian water rights.&#13;
16.    The short-termn strategy is to: (a) improve water quality and availability; collection, treatment,&#13;
reuse and overall system efficiency; protect public health; (b) finalize negotiations with Israeli authorities&#13;
on sources, uses and rights in order to secure sustainable long-term supplies; (c) focus on investments&#13;
to rehabilitate deteriorated systems and to extend these systems where necessary and feasible, particularly&#13;
to villages; (d) utilize foreign technical assistance to begin restructuring the Gaza utilities and help&#13;
improve system efficiency; (e) consolidate the individual Gaza utilities over time into a single regional&#13;
utility operating on a viable commercial basis; and (f) to strengthen the PWA's ability to plan, manage,&#13;
regulate and make policy for the sector. The medium/long-term strategy is to: (a) enter into broader&#13;
regional agreements to preserve resources and supplies; (b) extend safe and reliable services to all&#13;
villages; (c) consolidate the individual West Bank utilities into about 3 regional utilities operating on a&#13;
commercial basis; and (d) further strengthen PWA.&#13;
Neighborhood Upgrading&#13;
17.    Background: As a result of decades of neglect and steady population growth, many urban areas&#13;
in WBG lack basic social and physical infrastructure (including, inter alia, roads, water supply, drainage,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
sewerage, garbage collection services, and play areas, kindergartens, community meeting rooms, clinics,&#13;
etc.) This backlog is particularly acute in the older and poorer urban neighborhoods and the refugee&#13;
camps; and, of course, the problems are generally far worse in Gaza where there are over 50 lower-&#13;
income neighborhoods within the six largest municipalities which merit intervention.   These&#13;
neighborhoods account for about 60% of municipal areas and 78% of the urban population in Gaza.&#13;
Densities average about 450 persons per ha.  Some 27 neighborhoods totalling 467 ha. and&#13;
accommodating about 25-30,000 households have stable, secure tenure and would be suitable for&#13;
immediate upgrading. The balance, totalling about 250 ha., also badly need services but here tenure is&#13;
problematic.&#13;
18.   Issues and Strategy: The most critical issues are the following: extremely poor general service&#13;
and amenity provision; severe lack of maintenance of the few services that do exist; severe lack of&#13;
investment and maintenance funding; inability of LG institutions to plan, finance and manage service&#13;
provision; and inability of many (but not all) low-income households in these neighborhoods to bear the&#13;
full cost of service provision.&#13;
19.   The short-term strategy is to focus on Gaza and the older central areas of West Bank cities.&#13;
Initially surveys would be done to establish and rank neighborhoods in order of combined poverty and&#13;
lack of services using criteria agreed with MLG and municipalities. Based on this, a package of&#13;
upgrading services would be developed in consultation with communities, a system of community&#13;
participation defined, and a program of rehabilitation implemented with the assistance of donors. To the&#13;
extent possible works would be undertaken using labor intensive methods, and local NGOs would be&#13;
asked to help manage program definition and implementation. The medium/long-term strategy is to&#13;
develop the program into a sustainable one by stressing cost recovery, and extending the prograin to all&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
2/    The discussion here focuses on Gaza where the problems are most severe. But the problems may be&#13;
equally bad, if not as concentrated, in some of the older residential and commercial areas of West Bank&#13;
cities.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Local Governent Sector&#13;
Background, Issues and Strategies&#13;
Organization of the Annex&#13;
1.     The annex is arranged in three sections. The first gives a brief background and status report on&#13;
the sector; the second reviews the issues that are currently critical to address in order to improve the&#13;
performance of the local government system in delivering services, and the elements of the strategies that&#13;
are being considered to address these issues. The third section focuses on the Bank's support and how&#13;
this support relates to the issues and strategies to be pursued.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.     Currently, the local government system of WBG consists of municipalities, which operate under&#13;
laws having their origins in Egyptian law (Gaza) and Jordanian law (West Bank);'' village councils; and&#13;
villages under muchtars. There is a notional sense of districts centered around major municipalities, but&#13;
these geographical areas have no administrative status. There are 31 designated municipalities, 26 in the&#13;
West Bank and 5 in Gaza. Village councils number 103 and villages over 400. Before the advent of the&#13;
EAPC, the operations of local governments were loosely overseen and supported by the Civil&#13;
Administration of the Israeli Defense Forces (CA) which was primarily concerned with military/security&#13;
objectives. However, there is now a transitional situation in which the CA has essentially withdrawn and&#13;
the EAPC is creating a central government system to govern the country including managing a local&#13;
government system.&#13;
3.     The Ministry of Local Governrment (MLG) is assigned responsibility for the local governrment&#13;
system and has been actively engaged in trying to define the structure oi local government, the&#13;
institutional arrangements and the key organizations at the various levels, and the roles and functions at&#13;
these levels. In addition, MLG also must establish a viable role for itself within this system and in&#13;
relation to the other central government ministries. (Annex 12, Appendix A provides a brief outline and&#13;
an organizational chart of the Mliris.rx.)&#13;
4.     The dominant entities in the local government system are the municipalities, which have well-&#13;
established service dtlivery and regulatory functions, including electricity, water supply and sanitation,&#13;
solid waste management, local roads, libraries, parks and recreation, fire abatement, slaughter houses,&#13;
markets, land use planning and development and building approvaLls, and business and professional&#13;
licensing. Village councils, which in some cases have populations and areas that compare to existing&#13;
municipalities, are the next lower ievel of local government. They enjov a representative government&#13;
structure but lack the broad range of functions and revenue raising optiors of municipalities. Recently,&#13;
1/ Fortunately, there are commonalties in the roots of these laws as the two were originally derived from British&#13;
occupation law. Although differences have developed in the accounting and practices between West Bank and&#13;
Gaza municipalities, these are for the most part immaterial to the overall discussion and will not be elabor4ted&#13;
unless the difference has a bearing on the strategy of local govemment development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
three village councils have been upgraded to become municipalities in order to provide them with&#13;
revenues and representation that they did not previously enjoy. Villages without councils are the most&#13;
numerous type of local government but are quite small-sized and are administered by appointed muchtars.&#13;
In reality, until transferred to the EAPC, even municipal and village council governments in WBG could&#13;
only be considered marginally representative at best, as no elections had been held for several electoral&#13;
cycles in about two decades and all mayors and council members who had taken office since the onset&#13;
of occupation had been appointed by the Israelis.&#13;
5.     Local government services in WBG are inadequate. Municipalities are unable to respond&#13;
effectively to these circumstances for a variety of reasons: limited managerial capacity, resulting in lower&#13;
revenues and higher expenses than feasible; inadequate systems and financing for proper operations and&#13;
maintenance of existing assets; and an ad hoc system for capital development based on donor financing&#13;
through multiple windows and mechanisms.&#13;
6.     There are several examples of the managerial problems of the municipalities: Jenin's new&#13;
leadership has requested a quick response to help establish an administrative structure for the&#13;
municipality; Gaza City has only recently, and with difficulty, staffed its Technical Department; Hebron&#13;
is over NIS 5 million in arrears on its collection of solid waste management fees. Most of the political&#13;
and administrative leadership is relatively new, and after municipal elections, currently scheduled for&#13;
June/July 1996, new councillors and mayors - elected for the first time in decades - will take office. Of&#13;
the current 31 designated municipalities, only one (Nablus) is currently regarded as being in relatively&#13;
good managerial shape.&#13;
7.     With few exceptions, municipalities in WBG provide electricity distribution (Jericho does not)&#13;
and water supply services. Both revenues and expenditures are dominated by these services and the cash&#13;
surpluses from their operations are used to fund deficits in other municipal operations. In the five selected&#13;
municipalities involved in this proposed project, for example, (see Table 1) electricity and water revenues&#13;
in 1994 were between 69 percent and 88 percent of total current revenues and between 61 percent and&#13;
76 percent of total current expenditures. Electricity commands the greater proportion of these resources -&#13;
84 percent of these two services' revenues and 77 percent of their expenditures. It is the net revenues&#13;
from these services that the municipalities consider to be of greatest financial importance. About 10&#13;
percent of total current revenue appear to be derived from this net contribution, equivalent to about half&#13;
of all other current revenues. These other recurrent revenues include transfers from the central&#13;
government of shared revenues - a presently small yield from gasoline taxes in the West Bank and&#13;
property taxes collected on behalf of West Bank municipalities (Gaza collected their own property taxes&#13;
even under Israeli occupation). Together with municipal-administered taxes, fees and service charges,&#13;
these revenues make up the remaining 20 percent of recurrent revenues. Property taxes are the single&#13;
largest component (with wide variation by municipality, about 25 percent) of this group. Building permit&#13;
fees are currently a significant second as in some municipalities (for example, Gaza City and Ramallah&#13;
in the West Bank) there has been a building boom. Most of the remaining 17 or so items provide very&#13;
small yields.&#13;
8.     The need to address the structure, sources and administration of local government financing in&#13;
the near term is urgent. To date MOF projections of public sector financing (consumption, i.e., recurrent&#13;
expenditures 17 percent of GDP in 1996, falling to 16.7 percent for 1997 and 1998; investment, 7.5, 8.0&#13;
and 8.7 percent for 1996-98) do not adequately take into account the needs of local governments. Current&#13;
Bank estimates, which do not include village councils, villages or the proposed provinces, suggest that&#13;
municipalities' recurrent expenditures will be about 19 percent of projected central government recurrent&#13;
expenditures; development expenditure requirements, about 24 percent of total development expenditures;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and, overall, at least one fifth of public expenditures will be made at the local levels over the next two&#13;
to three years.&#13;

Issues and Strategies&#13;
9.    The issues that need to be addressed in improving the performance of the local government&#13;
system fall into three categories: the legal and institutional framework which determines the structure,&#13;
authority, responsibilities, roles and rules of the local government system; management of local&#13;
government services and functions, including the arrangements for provision and the structure and&#13;
organization of delivery, as well as operations and maintenance; andfinancing of local governments, their&#13;
services and their investments.&#13;
10.   It is clear that several issues are interrelated and that some issues cut across the categories used&#13;
for organizing this section. As a result the strategies also need to be interrelated and cross-cutting. Where&#13;
necessary, there are cross-references that identify these linkages.&#13;
Legal and Institutional Framework&#13;
11.   The issues regarding the development of the local government system in WBG are, in one&#13;
important respect, unique. The more usual situation that countries face is the existence of a well-&#13;
established central government structure and the need to create functioning local ?overnments. In WBG,&#13;
municipal governments and village councils have been in operation over the past three decades and a&#13;
central government is just currently being created. In conventional circumstances, the role and&#13;
responsibility of central government and its agencies are already defined and operational, and reform of&#13;
central-local systems means some form of decentralization in which weak local entities would hope to&#13;
receive increased powers and respons;bilities. In WBG, currently weak central ministries are trying to&#13;
define their roles and authority and see the process as one of asserting controi over the pre-existing local&#13;
bodies. This situation is aggravated by the current circumstances in which the EAPC is not yet fully in&#13;
charge of the country, do not have the full complement of governing instruments, are dependent on&#13;
donors for all development expenditures and some recurrent support, and in which the donors frequently&#13;
make independent arrangements with local authorities&#13;
&#13;

12.   The MLG has been considering a new local government structure and law to unify the legal&#13;
systems in operation. At present, it is not yet clear what will be the functions and degree of autonomy&#13;
of the local governments and the concomitant relationships between themselves and the central&#13;
government. Two versions of the potential new local government law have been drafted. One would&#13;
give the local governments a substantial amount of autonomy, building on the existing situation; the other&#13;
version is essentially a restatement of the old laws with heavy control retained at the center. MLG&#13;
appears to favor the principles of the former version, which are more likely to result in an effective and&#13;
efficient local government system. A new version of the law is to be drafted for presentation to the&#13;
Palestinian National Assembly, elected in January 1996, for its approval. This law would incorporate&#13;
the proposed new structure and would be the basis for local government elections to be held, perhaps,&#13;
by mid-1996.&#13;
The Proposed Intergovernmental System&#13;
13.   The framework for local governments that is currently being contemplated includes the following&#13;
types of local authorities: Provinces; Metropolitan Areas (in the cases of the Gaza City area, could also&#13;
be a province); Provincial Capitals; Municipalities; Village Councils; and, Local Committees. The&#13;
functions of these local governments would vary with the type. Provinces would, for example, ensure and&#13;
facilitate inter-jurisdictional responses to services with spillover effects beyond a single jurisdiction's&#13;
boundary; promote joint responses where economy of scale may improve the efficiency of service&#13;
delivery without reducing responsiveness; provide technical assistance on request; and directly assist local&#13;
committees and possibly some village councils. With regard to structure, the EAPC would like to create&#13;
a provincial government level based on the current geographical districts. The nine provinces (five in the&#13;
West Bank, four in Gaza) would be headed by Governors appointed by the President of the EAPC, and&#13;
their councils consist of the mayors and other representatives of the municipalities within them.&#13;
14.   The new law also is intended to strengthen the role of village councils and the representation of&#13;
the people at the village level by replacing muchtars with elected local committees. Promotion of local&#13;
committees to village councils, and village councils to municipalities would be based on population size&#13;
and proven competencies in handling their affairs. The list of functions assigned to each type of local&#13;
governmnent would be determined by the EAPC.&#13;
15.   Local governments would be authorized to levy specific taxes, service tariffs and charges and fees&#13;
sufficient to cover the cost of the functions assigned to them. Where appropriate taxes, charges and fees&#13;
are not available or efficiently managed at the local level, the EAPC may authorize the sharing of a&#13;
suitable central government tax such as the VAT and the gas tax with local governments on the basis of&#13;
an equitable formula. The EAPC would ensure the availability of supplementary capital financing, in the&#13;
form of grants or borrowing authority (and possibly even facility), to augment the development funds&#13;
local government are able to generate from their own resources.&#13;
16.   Local governments would have three types of accountability: to their residents for the efficiency,&#13;
quality and reliability of services and functions; to the source of financing for the agreed and proper use&#13;
of funds; and to the EAPC through its ministries, for the execution of government policy which they have&#13;
been entrusted with implementing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
Central Government Roles and Responsibilities&#13;
17.    The role of central government is to be coordinated through MLG. The Ministry coordinates with&#13;
the technical ministries to establisli policy and guidelines with regard to the services and functions&#13;
assigned to local governments. Incorporated in these policies and guidelines would be input standards,&#13;
performance standards and performance indicators to ensure service quality, efficiency and reliability.&#13;
MLG also is responsible to assist local governments in understanding and developing their capacity to&#13;
fulfill their functions in accordance with these policies. MLG would ensure the monitoring and reporting&#13;
on the performance of municipalities. In addition, MLG would work with the Ministry of Finance to&#13;
develop intergovernmental transfer systems in keeping with this framework. Indeed, the most vital service&#13;
that the EAPC will ultimately provide to the local governments of WBG will be fiscal and financial&#13;
assistance. This will be discussed in further detail in the section on Finance, below.&#13;
18.   It is anticipated that the systems for making effective the relationships between the levels of&#13;
government will be established in stages over a period of three to five years. Roles and responsibilities&#13;
at the central government have not yet been fully established, and even where the assignment of roles&#13;
would suggest associated responsibilities, the mechanisms and information to make it possible to fulfill&#13;
those responsibilities are not yet in place. With reference to local government services in particular, data&#13;
on the status of assets, service delivery performance, and recurrent finances are in the process of&#13;
collection, to be supported by this proposed project. Investments in local service improvements -&#13;
rehabilitation, expansion and building of new facilities - are currently almost entirely donor financed, and&#13;
as many of the projects involve direct arrangements between the donors and the local governments, no&#13;
centralized source of information on local investment programs exists. Consequently, the central&#13;
government is not in a position to determine geographical and sectoral distributional allocation policies,&#13;
set realistic standards and targets for service performance, or establish appropriate monitoring systems.&#13;
19.   It is expected that the EAPC will eventually assume the traditional role of central government in&#13;
determining assignment of functions, financing arrangements, sector policy, distribution policy and&#13;
accountability arrangements. As central government, the EAPC is responsible for poverty reduction and&#13;
may utilize the comparative advantage of local government in provision of certain services of particular&#13;
benefit and importance to the poor, by channeling financing of those services to the poor through local&#13;
governments.&#13;
20.    Local governments will benefit from the existence of a well-functioning central government.&#13;
Capacities and performance at the municipal level, for example, varies widely and several municipalities&#13;
are looking forward to assistance and guidance from the central government. Some aspects of municipal&#13;
functions cannot be carried out without central government services. An important examnple is&#13;
development control; local governments in West Bank complain that illegal structures that, for example,&#13;
create traffic hazards, cannot be removed in the absence of a functioning Palestinian police force in the&#13;
area. Moreover, there are critical capacity building functions that the central government should manage&#13;
and facilitate.&#13;
Finance&#13;
21.    The considerable variation that exists in reported financial results (see Table 2) among the&#13;
selected municipalities are in part related to difference in accounting practices and standards in these&#13;
municipalities. These differences, however, do not disguise some of the real variations in circumstances&#13;
and performance between these municipalities. West Bank and Gaza Strip municipalities reflect in their&#13;
accounts, relative differences in incomes between those parts of the Palestinian jurisdiction. The least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
favored West Bank municipality in per capita resource terms, Hebron, is twice as well endowed as Gaza&#13;
City, the richer of the two Gaza Strip municipalities. However, these differences are out of proportion&#13;
with the differences in per capita incomes in the two areas (US$2,190 in West Bank and US$1,290 in&#13;
Gaza, in 1994) indicating the presence of other reasons for performance differences.&#13;
22.    Expenditure reporting show a number of apparent gaps in service categories in the Gaza&#13;
municipalities. It would appear that neither of the Gaza municipalities, for example, provide fire services;&#13;
however, even some of these gaps may be a result of poor accounting as Gaza City has library expenses&#13;
but apparently, no library staff. Gaza City, notedly, is the only municipality that appears to be losing&#13;
money on its electricity operations.&#13;
23.    The issues and related strategies of finance fall readily into two categories: local government&#13;
revenues and capital investment policy and programming.&#13;
Local Government Revenue&#13;
24.    The dependence on the net revenues from electricity and water supply services has important&#13;
implications for the financial future of municipalities. Weaknesses in the municipal accounting systems&#13;
(it is a cash accounting system; costs are not all properly allocated; expenditures not made - for example,&#13;
for maintenance, have positive effects on balances; depreciation is not accounted for) do not allow for&#13;
an accurate determination of financial position, especially of service delivery systems. Nevertheless, it&#13;
is clear that there is substantial weakness in the revenue base of municipalities that is somewhat, but&#13;
inadequately, mitigated by cash surpluses in the electricity and water services accounts.&#13;
25.    For sound economic and managerial reasons discussed earlier, it is proposed that electricity&#13;
distribution be taken over by one or more power utility(ies). Should these restructurings take place, severe&#13;
additional pressures will be brought to bear on municipal finances. Even if the municipalities become&#13;
owners of these utilities, an immediate decline in revenues from these sources is anticipated. First, net&#13;
profits would be reduced by sharper pricing and proper cost accounting. Second, it would be&#13;
inappropriate for the utilities to distribute all of there current profits to shareholders as they would need&#13;
retained earnings for future expansion.&#13;
26.   In addition to the need to replace revenues lost to municipalities by the reorganization of water&#13;
and electricity services, there are other indications of the need to improve local revenues. It is&#13;
appropriate, for example, that municipalities should fund O&amp;M from their own resources, but this is&#13;
unlikely to occur until the overall revenue base of municipalities is strengthened. It will be necessary to&#13;
examine all aspects of recurrent financing, including charges for services, to ensure that they reflect&#13;
sound policies for cost recovery and demand management, and that any necessary subsidies are&#13;
transparent and targeted. Fees and taxes are critical components of the revenue structure that need to be&#13;
updated to ensure that they not only need traditionally appropriate criteria such as efficiency, buoyancy,&#13;
cost effectiveness and equity, but also are in keeping with overall fiscal policy objectives. While local&#13;
revenue structure and administration can and should be improved, it is clear that some fundamental&#13;
reforms will be necessary and these would probably include consideration of some form of shared taxes&#13;
or formula-based recurrent transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 7 of 12&#13;
Capital Investment Policy and Programming&#13;
27.   The backlog of investment requirements in WBG, the unusual situation of establishing a central&#13;
government structure on top of an existing local governnent system, and the dominant role of donors in&#13;
investment financing have together created unique problems for capital investment policy and&#13;
programming. First, project proposals may originate from a number of sources: the municipalities,&#13;
PECDAR, the MLG, the EAPC President and the several donors. Second, some of these participants may&#13;
play multiple roles in the project preparation process - among them, originators, designers, evaluators,&#13;
financiers and, ultimately implementation. Third, several different criteria are used by each and the arrays&#13;
may or may not include common elements, with different weights given to the various elements. Fourth,&#13;
as noted earlier, the MOF is frequently not involved and no EAPC ministry including MLG, has all the&#13;
information on what possible investments may be in the pipeline. Consultation and exchange of&#13;
information between the donors, and especially the coordination and screening roles by MLG and&#13;
PECDAR have helped significantly in reducing overlaps and conflicts. Nevertheless, it is necessary to&#13;
move towards a more orderly system to achieve greater efficiency in planning and implementation.&#13;
28.   Clarifying, streamlining and strengthening appropriate roles for MLG and PECDAR and more&#13;
integral involvement of the MOF in the process of project evaluation and approval is a critical area of&#13;
solution. Donors will have important roles to play in assisting this restructuring and capacity building&#13;
exercise.&#13;
29.   Estimates of development requirements (para. 8 above) in the short run also appear conservative.&#13;
Pre-screened proposals presented to the Bank for funding of local development projects under this project&#13;
in only three sectors (water and waste water for West Bank only, and roads) on an annualized basis&#13;
exceed the above estimates of total annual investment requirements for municipalities by 44 percent.&#13;
Given the priorities agreed between the donors and the EAPC, local government investment requirements&#13;
may be as much as 40 percent of projected total development expenditures.&#13;
30.   Donors have committed to continue to support development expenditures for the next five years;&#13;
however, substantial investments will be needed at the local level well into the future. It is unlikely that&#13;
local governments will be able to meet the funding requirements entirely from their own resources. The&#13;
central government will need to ensure the establishment of long-term financing mechanisms, including&#13;
from private sources. In addition, however, the EAPC will need to establish grant transfer mechanisms&#13;
in support of local investments in order that its policies with regard to basic services availability and&#13;
quality, growth and equity may be met.&#13;
31.   The MOF is aware of, and concerned about these issues. Commitments to the IMF and other&#13;
donors to balance the central government recurrent budget in 1996 and to generate a 1 % of GDP surplus&#13;
by FY98 preclude immediate absorption of local government requirements. However, the Ministry&#13;
supports a strategy of gradually assuming greater responsibility for inter-governmental finance in the&#13;
context of related reforms and improvements to the overall system of local government structure,&#13;
management and finance.&#13;
Management&#13;
32.   The management issues and strategies in WBG with regard to local government encompass the&#13;
provision and delivery of services (referred to as program management) and the operations and&#13;
maintenance of assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 8 of 12&#13;
Program Management&#13;
33.   The coverage, reliability and quality of most local government services are unsatisfactory in WBG&#13;
and below the levels of countries of similar per capita incomes. The substantial investment program&#13;
proposed to the donors is an indication that much of these problems is due to the backlog that resulted&#13;
from almost three decades of occupation. Beyond those investment needs, however, are issues of&#13;
structure, management and finance.&#13;
34.   Illustrations of these issues were noted in the background to this section. Other aspects will be&#13;
discussed under the Finance section, the most significant of which concerns the proposal to establish&#13;
utilities to manage the delivery of electricity and water supply services. Economies of scale in networks&#13;
and management and technical staffing, as well as more focused and professional attention to these&#13;
services suggest that organizing service delivery on this basis is likely to improve the performance of&#13;
these services. Increased efficiency .nd reliability in technical performance, better financial management&#13;
and lower costs to consumers are likely in the short run. In the medium to longer tenn, privatization also&#13;
becomes a viable option, thereby reducing demand on public investment resources. Nevertheless,&#13;
important decisions about the struu-ture of these utilities have yet to be determined; these include the&#13;
number of utilities and their ownership (partial or full ownership of all of these utilities by the&#13;
municipalities within their jurisdiction is being contemplated) and, of particular importance in this context,&#13;
their relationship to the municipalities. These questions are being examined under a Bank-supported&#13;
proposed project, the Electricity Sector Investment and Management Project and the recently negotiated&#13;
Water and Sanitation Services Project in Gaza.&#13;
35.    Addressing these issues will require a complex strategy which incorporates a mix of structural&#13;
reforms to facilitate and appropriately regulate private participation in service delivery and revision and&#13;
strengthening of government structures, staffing, systems andprocesses. Training workshop packages need&#13;
to be developed that are targeted to different levels of the municipal system. An urgent package is that&#13;
for incoming mayors and councillors. Packages would need to be prepared for the chief administrator and&#13;
heads of departments that emphasize both managing their departments and working within the overall&#13;
management system. Conducting workshops for new administrations should be a priority. Newly elected&#13;
mayors and councillors also will need guidance in establishing or strengthening its organizations and&#13;
agencies. In that context, it will be helpful to have documentation and dissemination of local best practice&#13;
and for exchanges of experiences between local governments to be facilitated.&#13;
36.    Among the particular systems that need to be designed include standardized accounting systems,&#13;
performance standards, operating options and structures, proper costing and pricing of services;&#13;
developing and implementing collection strategies to complement service improvement programs; cost&#13;
reduction programs, including community participation; designing the corporatizing and different forms&#13;
of privatizing of services, including concessions, management contracts, competition for service areas and&#13;
the use of NGOs; and establishing appropriate regulatory systems for privatized services.&#13;
37.   Integral to the improvement in management performance is to relate service improvement to&#13;
improved financial performance. Performance targets agreed upon would need to include financial results.&#13;
Particular emphasis should be put on strategies and programs to reduce the arrears in payments of&#13;
services. Experience elsewhere has indicated that success in linking improved service delivery and&#13;
improved willingness to pay requires greater public awareness, understanding and participation in&#13;
prioritizing and monitoring the program of service improvement. It is recognized in WBG that the issues&#13;
of improvements in local government services will not be resolved without the understanding and&#13;
participation of the people. Municipal residents will make a substantial financial contribution to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 9 of 12&#13;
overall program. Substantial arrears will need to be collected, and ultimately improved services will have&#13;
to be paid for. At the same time efficiency gains and cost saving may be achieved through the&#13;
participation of communities in service delivery. However, experience has indicated that people are&#13;
unwilling to pay for services that do not satisfy their priorities and needs and in which they do not have&#13;
voluntary input or voice. As a result it is critical that the people in local jurisdictions be aware of the&#13;
programs for service improvements, the nature and timing of the impact on them and be reminded of the&#13;
arrival of benefits when they occur.&#13;
Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
38.   In the absence of adequate revenues, local governments substantially neglect maintenance&#13;
expenditures. For example, unaccounted for water due to leakage and illegal connections is typically in&#13;
excess of 45 percent, and water is acknowledged to be among the most critical commodities in this water-&#13;
scarce region. As a rough measure of orders of magnitude, in one typical municipality, the total aznount&#13;
budgeted for maintenance was only 3 percent of total recurrent budget. Actual expenditure, although a&#13;
different absolute amount, also was 3 percent of actual overall recurrent expenditures. Broad guidelines&#13;
would suggest that annual maintenance expenditures should be approximately 3 percent of the value of&#13;
the assets being maintained. As it is reasonable to assume that the value of municipalities assets would&#13;
be substantially more than a single year's recurrent expenditure, it is clear that the financing of&#13;
maintenance is significantly underfunded. Further, discussions with municipalities indicate that&#13;
expenditure under the category of maintenance often is rehabilitation works occasioned by the absence&#13;
of regular and preventative maintenance.&#13;
39.   There are issues of management as well as finance. Municipalities do not all have the technical&#13;
and managerial expertise to plan and implement effective and efficient O&amp;M programs. A number of&#13;
steps need to be taken to put an appropriate system in place. Municipalities need to inventory their assets&#13;
as a first step in planning a systematic program of maintenance. Standards for the expected performance&#13;
of these assets and a maintenance schedule to ensure those performance standards should be established;&#13;
existing engineering standards would be a useful starting point for devising appropriate systems for WBG.&#13;
The management, staffing, structure and processes required to ensure an effective system should be&#13;
defined and developed and the personnel trained. A strategy for carrying out the O&amp;M program needs&#13;
to be determined - the fundamental decision for each set of assets is whether to contract out the O&amp;M&#13;
service or perform it in house. In the former case, qualification systems, bidding documents and&#13;
management contracts with performance standards and indicators would need to be prepared. In the latter&#13;
instance, structures, staffing and performance standards and indicators should be prepared and hiring and&#13;
training carried out.&#13;
Bank Support for Local Government Reform and Capacity Building&#13;
40.    The several issues that have been outlined in this annex indicate the critical and inter-related&#13;
problems that need to be confronted. On the basis of discussions of these issues and strategies agreed&#13;
between the Bank mission and MLG and MOF, it is proposed that these be addressed by a program of&#13;
technical assistance organized according to the three major sets of issues: the legal and administrative&#13;
framework; management; andfinance. The program would involve six related components which would&#13;
be overseen by three EAPC Technical Committees and reflects the strategies outlined in the above&#13;
sections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 10 of 12&#13;
Supporting the Reform of the Legal and Institutional Framework&#13;
41.   The assistance proposed is for the most immediate need and requires only a short duration. It is&#13;
nevertheless critical. The objectives are to: preserve and expand where appropriate, legitimate roles and&#13;
functions of existing municipalities; define compatible roles and functions for provinces; establish&#13;
appropriate roles, functions and rules for the other entities in the local government system, including a&#13;
classification and assignment system; assign proper financial authority to accompany responsibilities;&#13;
establish appropriate accountability systems; and to strengthen the capacity of the overall system to carry&#13;
out its new functions.&#13;
42.   The component, Local Government Legal and Institutional Framework would support a brief&#13;
study to assist in elaborating on the framework for local governments in WBG as outlined above (paras.&#13;
13 to 20). The results of this study would be an input into the new local government law which the&#13;
government proposes to prepare soon after the election of new Palestinian National Council. The Legal&#13;
and Institutional Technical Committee (LITC) chaired by MLG and including representatives of MOF,&#13;
Ministry of the Interior, municipalities and local councils would be responsible for overseeing this study.&#13;
The study would begin about mid-March, 1996 and would be completed by mid-April, 1996;&#13;
Supporting the Strengthening of the Local Government Finance System&#13;
43.   Two components provide the elements of this support. The first addresses local government&#13;
revenues, while the second deals with capital investment policy and programming. The Fiscal and&#13;
Financial Technical Committee (FTC) chaired by MOF and including the Ministry of Planning, MLG,&#13;
the technical ministries and PECDAR as well as representatives of the local governments would oversee&#13;
these components.&#13;
44.   The first component would be directly overseen by a sub-committee of FTC chaired by MOF and&#13;
including, MLG and local government representatives. The Local Government Revenue Structure and&#13;
Strategy Study would review alternatives and prepare an implementation plan to improve local&#13;
government revenues (paras. 24 to 26). This work, which would be closely related to the Program&#13;
Management and the Capital Investment Policy and Programming efforts (see below), would examine all&#13;
aspects of local recurrent financing, including charges for services, fees and taxes and recommend a&#13;
structure and system that would be efficient, cost effective, buoyant and equitable. At the request of the&#13;
MOF, this study would be accelerated, starting in parallel with the Program Management Study, with the&#13;
intention of implementing new revenue structures in a year. The program would include instruments to&#13;
monitor their impact in order to recommend any modification in implementation.&#13;
45.   The second component is the Local Government Capital Investment Policy and Programming.&#13;
This major effort would rationalize information flows on investment proposals and programs, assist in&#13;
the development and application of tools to assess and prioritize investments and develop resource&#13;
allocation systems to reflect government sectoral, geographical and equity policies (paras. 27 to 31). The&#13;
work would be related closely to the studies on local government revenue and program management. The&#13;
studies under this component would establish performance indicators and performance standards for&#13;
services, national service standards, guidelines on input standards and planning and design procedures&#13;
for services, and the timeframe within which national service standards targets should be achieved. This&#13;
project would initiate this work by putting its resources through the MOF and transferring the analytical&#13;
tools used in project selection to MLG and PECDAR. Within a year arrangement would be made to have&#13;
the other donor projects for local government flowing through the same system. During the third year&#13;
the remaining aspects of the work would be completed.&#13;

Supporting Management Reformn and Development&#13;
46.   Three components would be provided for this support, all overseen by the Managerial Technical&#13;
Committee (MTC) chaired by MLG and including representatives of MOF, the technical ministries and&#13;
local governments. The first component, Local Government Program Management and Training,&#13;
would address the problems discussed that have resulted in poorly performing local government services&#13;
(paras. 33 to 37). This program would design structural, managerial and financial reforms and training&#13;
at the local level as well as strengthening MLG itself. Work would begin on initiation of the project and&#13;
continue throughout its implementation.&#13;
47.   The second  component, Local Government Operations and  Maintenance  (O&amp;M)&#13;
Progranuning, (paras. 38 and 39) would pilot the development of an operations and maintenance&#13;
program in the five selected municipalities (Gaza City, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus and Rafah) and expand the&#13;
program to the remaining local governments based on lessons learned, with the assistance of other donors.&#13;
The pilot phase would be initiated at the start of the project and the expansion phase would begin a year&#13;
later.&#13;
48.   The third component is a public information and education plan to complement and directly&#13;
support the objectives and other activities of this program. The Local Government Public Information&#13;
Program would provide mechanisms for feedback from the community on priorities, strategies and the&#13;
perceived performance of the program (para. 36). It will begin with the start of the project and continue&#13;
throughout.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
The Five Selected Municipalities, Background, Issues and Strategy&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Most elements of the strategy for assisting the Local Government Sector (Annex 2) propose to&#13;
initiate reforms by working with the five selected municipalities (Hebron, Jenin, Nablus in the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza City and Rafah in the Gaza Strip) and subsequently extending the lessons learned and solutions&#13;
developed to the system as a whole. As a result, work on improving poorly performing local government&#13;
services, the development of an operations and maintenance program, and a public information and&#13;
education plan would be piloted in these municipalities.  This strategy is appropriate as these&#13;
municipalities are representative of most of the strengths and weaknesses in the current system in WBG.&#13;
In addition to these broad strategic initiatives, however, particular assistance will be provided to address&#13;
issues specific to each municipality. The primary characteristics and particularly urgent requirements of&#13;
these five municipalities are summarized below.&#13;
Gaza&#13;
2.    Gaza municipality has a substantial number of talented, well-educated professionals in key&#13;
managerial positions. It has been able to take advantage of assistance from several sources to upgrade&#13;
the quality of municipal planning and management. With the help of three consultants provided by the&#13;
Palestinian Welfare Association, the city has been able to develop procedures to improve the identification&#13;
and collection of delinquent accounts; to reform and upgrade the quality of the budget process; to improve&#13;
procedures for internal audits and to design a new internal audit manual; and to create a new personnel&#13;
manual and redesign many of the forms and procedures used in the hiring, evaluation and promotion of&#13;
staff.&#13;
3.    The World Bank is currently funding a project by Arthur Anderson to restructure and computerize&#13;
Gaza's municipal accounts. This initiative will facilitate the move to accrual accounting, better match&#13;
revenues with expenditures, and improve the integration of more accurate cost data into the budget.&#13;
4.    The municipality has begun to assess its training needs and to put together a staff development&#13;
program. Several of its management improvement efforts, such as the drafting of a handbook on&#13;
personnel policy, can serve as an example of best practice for other municipalities.&#13;
5.    Although substantial progress has been made to date, difficult questions of implementation remain&#13;
on many of these issues. Funding for consultants from the Palestinian Welfare Association will run out&#13;
soon, and the project to standardize municipal financial accounts has encountered significant delays.&#13;
Many important systems, such as those for the planning and design of infrastructure projects, are needed.&#13;
In addition, the current personnel policies has limitations that constrain the ability of the managers to best&#13;
attract and utilize staff.&#13;
6.     Specific assistance is proposed to be provided to Gaza City to continue to support the ongoing&#13;
management and accounting improvement programs. To address the personnel issues, assistance will be&#13;
provided to review current policies and recommend adjustments. Finally, support for upgrading computer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
systems and relevant training to utilize GIS software to upgrade municipal planning and the design of&#13;
infrastructure projects will be included.&#13;
Hebron&#13;
7.     The professional qualifications of municipal staff in Hebron are generally strong, particularly in&#13;
the engineering and technical fields.  Some preliminary work is currently being funded by the&#13;
municipality to computerize its financial accounts. The municipality is also funding a study to re-design&#13;
its current organizational structures to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. This study will involve&#13;
a detailed assessment of the work of each department and its interaction with other units, and it will seek&#13;
savings through eliminating redundancies, streamlining operations, optimizing the span of managerial&#13;
control and reducing the amount of paperwork. Internal controls appear to be functioning in a generally&#13;
effective fashion, and there are no ghost workers or other manifestations of chronically weak systems for&#13;
establishment management and control.&#13;
8.     However, many systems, such as those for financial management, are in need of major upgrades.&#13;
(Currently there is no municipal charter of accounts, for example.) The personnel system also needs to&#13;
be upgraded. Recruitment appears to be taking place in a meritocratic fashion, but procedures for per-&#13;
formance monitoring and evaluation need to be upgraded and made more transparent.&#13;
9.     The most urgent needs of the municipality is for specialized technical support for the design of&#13;
infrastructure systems such as sewage treatment plants, and for the preparation of structure plan and a&#13;
strategic planning system to guide development planning and control.&#13;
10.    The specific support to Hebron would include ensuring the continuation and completion of&#13;
ongoing reform initiatives. In addition, resources would be provided to allow Hebron to draw on a pool&#13;
of technical expertise on an as-needed, when-needed basis. Finally, a team of consultants to assist in the&#13;
preparation of a structure plan and a strategic planning system would be provided.&#13;
Jenin&#13;
11.   Jenin has a capable city manager and some talented technical staff.  Unfortunately, the&#13;
municipality lags behind many otherF in the development of efficient and effect:ve administrative systems.&#13;
In virtually all areas, ranging from organizational structure and design to financial management to&#13;
personnel management, major upgrades in the quality of municipal management will be necessary.&#13;
12.    Three areas require particularly rapid action. In terms of municipal planning, it is likely that the&#13;
size of the city will increase rapidly over the next two to three years as several outlying villages are&#13;
incorporated into the municipality. Currently, there is no comprehensive plan for expanding municipal&#13;
services to cope with this increase. The development of an appropriate plan that is carefully costed and&#13;
linked to a medium-term financial framework will be absolutely essential.&#13;
13.    Second, there is a need for a major upgrade and computerization of municipal financial systems.&#13;
More aggressive effort in the area of cost recovery is necessary, and the budget process needs to be&#13;
upgraded and based upon more accurate cost data. It is likely that considerable corruption currently&#13;
exists within the municipality, so expenditure controls must be reviewed and capabilities for internal and&#13;
external audit must be upgraded.&#13;
14.   The current personnel system is in disarray. Procedures for establishment management are weak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

or non-existent, resulting in per capita employment levels that are among the highest in the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza. (Unfortunately, these numbers are likely to reflect the presence of considerable numbers of&#13;
ghost workers.) There is no routinized system for recruitment, performance evaluation and promotion.&#13;
An estimated 100 employees, or roughly one-third of the municipal workforce, are currently occupying&#13;
positions for which they have had no previous training or experience. Current personnel policies also&#13;
constrain staffing options.&#13;
15.    Addressing personnel issues are absolutely critical in Jenin. Technical assistance is proposed to&#13;
urgently assist in reviewing policies, instruments and procedures, designing an effective management and&#13;
operating structure and to plan and execute a recruitment program. Because Jenin may undergo a major&#13;
expansion in the next few years as surrounding villages are incorporated into the municipality, there is&#13;
a need for a comprehensive planning process that can lay out development priorities, identify&#13;
infrastructure requirements, and prepare an investment program and strategy. Technical assistance in this&#13;
area is a critical priority, as is the provision of GIS hardware, software and training.&#13;
Nablus&#13;
16.   Nablus is one of the best organized and managed municipalities on the West Bank and Gaza. It&#13;
is currently receiving assistance from Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. under a World Bank financed project to&#13;
upgrade and computerize its municipal accounts. Other practices, such as the regular compilation and&#13;
dissemination of financial reports to line mangers and the decentralization of some accounting functions&#13;
to individual departments, serve as local examples of best practice and should be disseminated to other&#13;
settings.&#13;
17.    Nablus has also implemented some innovative programs in the area of receiving stakeholder&#13;
feedback, including holding regular sessions in which a rotating committee of three city council members&#13;
listens to citizen complaints. The complaint is written up on a standardized form and addressed to the&#13;
head of the relevant municipal department, who is required to respond. With modest local modifications,&#13;
this practice should also be disseminated to other communities.&#13;
18.   Considerable challenges remain, however, to fully bring the quality of Nablus's administration&#13;
up to existing best practice in many parts of the world. The work to upgrade the quality of its municipal&#13;
accounts has revealed a number of serious weaknesses, including the lack of a charter of accounts; in-&#13;
adequate systems for planning and forecasting expenditures and linking them to the budget, and a failure&#13;
to integrate accurate cost data into the budget process. Training in cost accounting is a top priority.&#13;
There is also a critical need to establish an internal audit unit and to ensure that the downstream&#13;
implications of capital projects are reflected in the budget.&#13;
19.   The personnel system is functioning fairly well, but policies constrain recruitment and retention&#13;
of sufficient qualified staff. The Palestinian Welfare Organization is sponsoring some consulting work&#13;
by the firm CCC to upgrade the quality of technical management. However, the most significant problem&#13;
that Nablus is experiencing is in strategic investment planning that prioritize between competing demands.&#13;
20.   Personnel policy and management in Nablus needs to be improved and technical assistance for&#13;
this purpose is proposed. Support also is to be provided for consultants to assist in the preparation of&#13;
a strategic investment program for the municipality.&#13;
&#13;

Rafah&#13;
21.   Rafah has dedicated and motivated staff in several key positions. Its municipal plan, developed&#13;
in the late 1980s, is still relevant for the city's needs. Rafah has received donor assistance in upgrading&#13;
the quality of its administration in several areas; the EU and UNDP, for example, have been heavily&#13;
engaged in improving the management of water, sewerage and solid waste collection.&#13;
22.   However, in comparison with other municipalities in the West Bank and Gaza, Rafah's&#13;
management systems are relatively underdeveloped and will require significant upgrading across the&#13;
board. Currently, only Rafah's personnel and salary accounts are computerized. One of the top priorities&#13;
will be to put in an integrated and computerized financial management system. All budgeting currently&#13;
takes place by hand, and there is no regular system for monitoring expenditures and disseminating&#13;
financial reports to line managers on a regular basis. There is a need to move away from incremental&#13;
budgeting and to integrate more accurate cost data into the budget. There is also a need to track revenues&#13;
and link them to expenditures, for significant cross-subsidies exist between the Electricity and Water&#13;
Departments and the other departments.&#13;
23.    Rafah's systems for personnel management will also need to be upgraded. Recruitment appears&#13;
to be based upon merit, with posted job descriptions and clearly defined hiring criteria. However, no&#13;
systematic procedures exist for monitoring and evaluating performance. The pay system needs to be&#13;
regularized and monitized to reduce the number of special allowances, and manpower audits are needed&#13;
to identify staff excesses and shortages is critical areas.&#13;
24.   Particular attention must be devoted to the "nuts and bolts" institutional issues that are hampering&#13;
cost recovery. For example, there is a need for better metering of municipal wells to monitor the loss&#13;
in water supply (which is currently estimated at 40%, with about 10-15 % coming through unauthorized&#13;
or illegal connections.&#13;
25.   Rafah's broad based need for assistance will make it a primary beneficiary from the piloting of&#13;
improvement programs and reforms referred to in the Introduction section of this annex. In addition,&#13;
access to a pool of technical expertise with regard to water systems management and support for a review&#13;
of personnel policies and practices is also proposed.&#13;

Mr. Odin Knudsen,&#13;
Resident Representative,&#13;

West Bank &amp; Gaza&#13;
Dear Sir,&#13;
Subiect: The 1 oal (Government Develonment Policv of the FRecutite Anthnritv&#13;
of the Palestinian Council&#13;
The Palestinian people have taken a major step forward on the road towards our&#13;
objective of a Palestinian state, with the receat successful completion of national elections.&#13;
We must now turn our attentions to consolidating our democracy in the stucture and&#13;
operations of government at the level at which it is closest to its citizens. For almost three&#13;
decades, local governments in West Bank and Gaza operated without the benefit of their own&#13;
central government. They have held together and provided services to our people under&#13;
limnitations of their authority and neglect of their needs. They have been important&#13;
historically and will be more so in the future. It is for these reasons that we have set in&#13;
motion a process to modemize and upgrade the local government system and to integrate that&#13;
system into the new national system.&#13;
I would like to inform you of the Executive Authority of the Palestinian Council's&#13;
(EAPC) policy with regard to this important aspect of our development program.&#13;
The EAPC will establish a local government system with levels with differing&#13;
functions based on status and capacities. The possible range of local governments being&#13;
considered include: provinces; metropolitan areas (which in the case of northern Gaza, may&#13;
also be a province); provincial capitals, municipalities; village councils; and, local&#13;
committees.&#13;
ln contrast with the recent past, local governments, especial'y at the level of&#13;
municipalities and above, will be granted the appropriate autonomy to carry out their&#13;
assigned functions through their elected officials. Consistent with this degree of autonomy,&#13;
local governments will bc authorized to levy specific taxes, service tariffs and charges and&#13;
fees and will have flexibility to establish personnel policies with regard to com pensation thet&#13;
they are able to afford and that are consistent with broad national guidelines. We will be put&#13;
in place systems that ensure that local governrments will be accountable: to their citizens for&#13;
erricient and reliable services at quality sEandards established by the EAPC through its&#13;
ministries; to the sources of financing for agreed and proper use of funds; and to the EAPC&#13;
for the execution of government policy that they have been entrusted witti implementing.&#13;

The EAPC  will establisl financial alrematives for local governments that are&#13;
consistent with sound principles. However, it also is the policy of the PNA that to maintain&#13;
appropriatc financial discipline, local governments will not be allowed acccss to taxes, loans&#13;
or grants outside of himits and sources established by prior policy.&#13;
The Ministry of Local Govem-eat (,MLG) will coordinate the relationships of&#13;
central government with local governnents and  will represent Ehe interests of local&#13;
governments withirn the EAPC. The Ministry will coordinate with other ministries to&#13;
establish policy and guidelines with regard to the services and  nctions assigned to local&#13;
govemnments. MLG also is responsible to assist local governments in understanding and&#13;
developing their capacity to flulfill their functions in accordaace with these policies. M.ILG&#13;
would ensumr the moniroring and reporting on the performance of municipalities.&#13;
The basic principles of this poLicy will be incorporated into a new local government&#13;
law which also will unify local government operations under one law, replacing the separate&#13;
laws currently governing operations in the West Bank and Gaza. This law will be presented&#13;
to the Palestinian National Assembly before the clection of local govemment leaders; it is&#13;
intended that these elections would take place on the basis of this new law. In recognition of&#13;
the fact that this is an evolving policy, the law wiU provide a framework of principles, with&#13;
the operaTing details to be specified by subsequent regulations. The law also is intended to&#13;
strengthen the role of village councils and the representation of the people at the village level&#13;
by replacing muchtars with elected local committees.&#13;
As mrany of the policies necessary to give full effem to the EAPC's intentions require&#13;
structures, capacities and studies that are only now being built or caried out, the EAPC is&#13;
pleased that the World Bank will assist in estblishing a process and time table for their&#13;
implementation. We also are pseased that resources provided by the World l3ank under the&#13;
Municipal Infrastructure Dcvelopment Project (MIDP) will be utilized to support this&#13;
process. Wc fully endorse and welcome this project and intend to ensure its success. An&#13;
Interministerial Steering Committe and Working Committees has been established to&#13;
manage this process. The membership and termns of reference of these commiuees as well as&#13;
the timetable for their various outputs will be communicated to the World Bank separately.&#13;

MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Maintenance Sub-Program&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Almost three decades of inadequate resources have led to the neglect of maintenance of&#13;
infrastructure in WBG. Facing budget constraints and the requirement to balance budgets, municipalities&#13;
in WBG have over many years limited maintenance activities mainly to urgent expenditures to respond&#13;
to breakdowns or severe diminution of services. Annex 2 (Local Government Issues and Strategy) noted&#13;
the low level of expenditure compared to general norms. However, the problems of maintenance has not&#13;
been limited to finance; planning, programming and management of maintenance also have been&#13;
neglected. These systems now need to be rehabilitated in order that benefits from existing infrastructure&#13;
assets as well as the substantial new investments currently programmed, may be fully realized. This&#13;
component is designed to pilot the design and implementation of local infrastructure maintenance&#13;
programs in the selected municipalities and to extend the lessons into the structuring and implementation&#13;
of programs of maintenance for local infrastructure throughout WBG.&#13;
Developing and Managing the Program&#13;
2.    The selected municipalities (SMs) each will establish a working group (WG) led by the head of&#13;
the technical department, and including the heads of all infrastructure services in the municipalities. This&#13;
WG will be responsible for overseeing the design and implementation of this program (Annex 8). The&#13;
WG will be supported, as required, by consultants financed under this project.&#13;
3.    In preparing this component, it was recognized that the development and implementation of a&#13;
system for maintenance would be facilitated if a successful working model could be found that could&#13;
readily be adapted to the realities of the WBG situation. As a result, it was determined to assess whether&#13;
a model of a successful program may be identified within proximity to WBG. A model which met these&#13;
considerations was identified in the Arab-managed municipality of Nazareth, in Israel. This successful&#13;
program has been developed and implemented over the past five years, indicating that a long gestation&#13;
period for the implementation of a similar system in WBG should not be necessary. In addition, the&#13;
managers of the program in Nazareth expressed interest in assisting the WBG SMs by providing&#13;
information, experiences and expertise to municipalities. Costs associated with the assistance provided&#13;
by Nazareth will be supported by the project. The approach that has been adopted for the development&#13;
of the WBG maintenance program, therefore, has been based on the systems that are operating in&#13;
Nazareth. It is anticipated that differences in the current availability of data and resources, and the need&#13;
to begin to implement improvements as soon as possible, will result in adaptations of this model.&#13;
However, the principles which underlay its operations are expected to be robust.&#13;
4.    The process of developing the programs in the SMs will begin, after the formation of the WGs,&#13;
with a request to the Nazareth Mayor for that city to participate in assisting in this process. On&#13;
agreement on the modalities, each SM will hold a workshop with the Nazareth team to develop a broad&#13;
understanding of the situation of the SM by the Nazareth team and a similar understanding of the&#13;
principles, practices, data bases, analytic approaches, instruments and outcomes of the Nazareth model.&#13;
The objective of this workshop will be to provide the framework for a detailed design of the development&#13;
of the program. The SM will identify with the Nazareth team, the information and resource gaps that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
would need to be filled, as well as critical contextual circumstances that would influence the design of&#13;
a system suitable to and sustainable by, the SM. The expertise and activities necessary to fill the gaps&#13;
and a tentative timetable for these activities would be an important output. Further inputs desired from&#13;
the Nazareth team also would be identified.&#13;
5.     The WG would initiate the preparation activities for the maintenance program on the basis of&#13;
the outcome of this workshop. In planning for this maintenance program, the WG will define modules&#13;
of activity that may be initiated as soon as possible and as these modules are prepared, with the assistance&#13;
of consultants financed under this project, they would be implemented, also with project financing.&#13;
Successive modules would be initiated until a complete program is prepared and implemented.&#13;
6.     To facilitate the objective of designing a national program based on the experiences of the SMs,&#13;
they would inform the Management Technical Committee at each stage of the development of the&#13;
program, of the process followed, its outcomes and the resulting plans. The Management Technical&#13;
Committee, with the help of their consultants, will synthesize the lessons learned into a set of guidelines&#13;
and training programs for the other municipalities and agencies responsible for maintenance of local&#13;
infrastructure. In addition, the Committee will oversee the preparation of a national program for&#13;
maintenance to be presented to donors, for their support.&#13;
7.     The Nazareth Model. The remainder of this annex outlines some indicative elements of this&#13;
Nazareth model. The following features underlay the design and operations of the Nazareth maintenance&#13;
program:&#13;
a) Maintenance planning   begins with infrastructure systems and project design and&#13;
implementation. As a result, standards and specifications that are developed for works are&#13;
influenced by their maintenance implications, and the operating life and performance&#13;
characteristics of components and materials are used to develop maintenance plans and&#13;
schedules. To ensure that standards are met, implementation is supervised by qualified&#13;
professional staff of the municipality.&#13;
b) Specific strategies are developed for preventative maintenance, which is designed to reduce&#13;
failures of systems components and resulting loss of services; and repairs, which address&#13;
failures that do occur.&#13;
c) Public and private sector roles are assigned according to the comparative advantages of each&#13;
and in such a manner as to reduce overall costs and improve performance.&#13;
d) Public education and responsiveness to the public is a critical and integral part of the&#13;
program.&#13;
8.     Examples of these principles applied to the services of water supply, wastewater disposal and&#13;
roads as described below:&#13;
Water&#13;
Design, Construction and Supervision: In order to have a balanced system that does not result&#13;
in undue pressures in some areas and partially filled pipes in others, both of which conditions&#13;
contribute to failures, Nazareth is divided into eight pressure zones based on topography and it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
is planned to have a reservoir for each pressure zone. Three types of pipes and installation&#13;
methods for household connections are utilized depending on the terrain and soil conditions. In&#13;
mountainous areas, with rocky soils, steel pipes are used and covered in concrete; where soil&#13;
conditions are amenable, pipes are covered in plastic; and, in softer soils steel with asphalt cover&#13;
is installed.&#13;
Projects are supervised according to size; big projects are supervised by both consultants and&#13;
municipality staff, plus periodic inspections by the Chief Engineer. Welded pipes are x-rayed&#13;
and pressure tested; they must have been welded by a licensed welder. This procedure results&#13;
in an average life of 22-25 years.&#13;
Maintenance Planning: Contractors must provide as built drawings to the municipalities for&#13;
documentation purposes and all buildings must file plans with them so that the location of lines&#13;
are known. Programs of protection or replacement are planned for pipes, depending on the&#13;
conditions. Plans for replacements also are coordinated with road upgrading. Structure plans&#13;
are prepared and updated regularly. Annual reviews determine which pipes are to be replaced&#13;
as a result of age. Meters are changed every five years.&#13;
Private Sector Participation: The responsibility for the replacement of large pipes is assigned&#13;
to contractors who are on call, having been selected and assigned according to pre-established&#13;
zones in the city. This clearly minimizes the staff and equipment for this purpose that would be&#13;
necessary for the municipallty to keep. Pumps are maintained under contract for similar reasons.&#13;
Repairs and Responsiveness to the Public: The maintenance groups work sixteen hours a day,&#13;
in two shifts, in order to ensure that the 125 monthly repair calls are fixed the same day that the&#13;
complaints are received. The critical aspect of the strategy for repairs is to minimize response&#13;
time, and secondly to reduce losses to the municipality. This has resulted in a policy of&#13;
instituting temporary relief measures when immediate repairs are not possible. When a complaint&#13;
is received, an inspector is dispatched to determine need (unless it is already known that&#13;
excavation will be necessary, in which case that team goes immediately). The inspector (or&#13;
excavation team) radios in the (other) requirements, and the necessary team follows. Staff&#13;
training emphasizes fixing it right, first time.&#13;
Wastewater&#13;
Routine maintenance: Pipes are flushed at least once a year, before winter, and once more&#13;
during winter for known trouble spots. In some areas, culverts are closed during the summer&#13;
to prevent dumping of materials in them. Staff are trained to recognize warning signs of&#13;
problems and must inspect for them; when lines are blocked and when culverts are being cleaned&#13;
potential and current repair needs are identified. There is a systematic program for opening of&#13;
manhole covers and inspection of lines.&#13;
Roads&#13;
Maintenance planning: Each road has its own documentation and ongoing expenditure account.&#13;
The system tracks the remaining life of a road to determine the appropriate maintenance activity.&#13;
The estimated life of a new or completely renovated road is about eight or nine years, and the&#13;
effects of asphalting, overlays and renovation on extending the life of the road is calculated and&#13;
assessed along with other known conditions such as accumulated expenditure since last major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
works, traffic type and volume. In addition, plans for road excavation for water works are&#13;
reviewed. On this basis, the appropriate action is scheduled. Daily inspections also identify&#13;
areas for asphalting.&#13;
Private sector involvement: Annually, a book of contracts for all maintenance work to be done&#13;
is prepared and qualified contractors are invited to bid for these works. These contractors are&#13;
then on call throughout the year to provide the appropriate services to the municipality at the bid&#13;
price. This facilitates the planning and budgeting of the municipality, decreases the response time&#13;
for work to be initiated and allows more flexible appropriate scheduling.&#13;
Public Education and Involvement&#13;
9.     The municipality has created a rapid response center to field citizen complaints and reports on&#13;
maintenance or repairs needed. This center has toll-free hotline services manned 24 hours a day, backed&#13;
by crews at work 16 hours a day and on-call duty during the remaining eight hours. The number of these&#13;
hotlines and other urgent numbers are mailed annually with the utilities bills. The public is alerted by&#13;
public education programs to provide critical information when calling hotlines. These include location,&#13;
(with street lights, the number on the electricity pole), the manifestation of the problem, and the action&#13;
taken, if any. By the municipality responding quickly to these calls the public has learned that it is&#13;
worthwhile to utilize this facility. As a result, the cost to the municipality and the public of systems&#13;
failures has been greatly reduced.&#13;
Studies and Guidelines&#13;
10.   The Nazareth program has carried out a number of studies related to maintenance in order to&#13;
determine the most beneficial strategies. In addition, the professional associations in the sectors have&#13;
disseminated experience and recommended specifications for equipment and procedures that have been&#13;
helpful in planning and management of maintenance.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Neighborhood Upgrading Sub-Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Neighborhood Upgrading Sub-program would help support the coordinated provision of much&#13;
needed basic infrastructure, services and community facilities in existing lower-income communities in&#13;
Gaza and the West Bank. It would also help revitalize the dilapidated central areas of the older&#13;
municipalities. Because of funding constraints, the project will begin with the most urgent problem areas&#13;
in the SMs in Gaza, and would focus on those lower-income residential neighborhoods where land tenure&#13;
is not in dispute. Therefore, squatter settlements and refugee camps would not be included at this stage.&#13;
The neighborhoods to be upgraded have been selected using a set of criteria which include poverty,&#13;
inadequacy of infrastructure and services, willingness of the commnunity to participate, and potential for&#13;
synergy with other community development programs. Selection also took into account current municipal&#13;
development plans and other Bank-Group and donor-assisted infrastructure improvement projects.&#13;
Consideration is being given to linking the sub-program with USAID's existing Home Improvement Loan&#13;
Program so that families in the upgraded areas could also benefit from loans under this program.&#13;
The Gaza and Rafah Sub-projects&#13;
2.    The municipalities of Gaza and Rafah have identified ten priority neighborhoods, representing&#13;
the most under-serviced of the low-income areas. Four of these neighborhoods have been selected for&#13;
initial inclusion in the project. They are typical of the older, mixed-use communities of Gaza Strip cities.&#13;
In all areas, land and buildings are privately-owned and title is uncontested. The majority of dwelling&#13;
units are freehold properties dating back several decades. Rental units (aside from the commercial space)&#13;
are not common. Typically there are small shops and commercial/small-scale manufacturing enterprises&#13;
along main and secondary streets. The most common dwelling types are two- to five-story apartment&#13;
buildings. Construction is of permanent materials, with a considerable amount of recent expansion of&#13;
units. All these areas suffer from recurring and severe flooding problems. Most have the double&#13;
problem of flooding and inadequate septic pits. In the rainy season, low-lying areas experience sewerage&#13;
discharge into flood waters on the streets. The oldest areas have narrow and irregular street layouts,&#13;
which would be fully paved (no curbs/sidewalks are needed). Virtually all streets and footpaths are&#13;
unpaved, and extremely difficult to transit in the rainy season. All communities need street-lighting,&#13;
experience garbage collection problems and are deficient in basic community facilities.&#13;
3.    The project would aim to significantly alleviate the most urgent of these problems, and works&#13;
would be designed so as to prevent the relocation of residents, (although there may be isolated cases&#13;
where some temporary relocation during construction may be necessary). Implementation would be the&#13;
responsibility of the engineering departments of the relevant SM, working in close consultation and&#13;
cooperation with the community. To the extent possible, it would adopt labor-intensive construction&#13;
techniques and draw upon the experience of NGOs operating in the area. The SMs would be provided&#13;
with technical assistance under the project to help with detailed preparation and implementation.&#13;
4.    A list of the project neighborhoods and a summary of development costs is presented in Table&#13;
1 below. The neighborhoods are similar in size (10-14 ha.) and density (410-490 persons per ha.); their&#13;
upgrading cost ranges from about $85,000 per ha. to $105,000 per ha. (or US$1,200-1,750/Household),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
depending on specific needs and conditions. Investments would typically include a package of water&#13;
reticulation improvements; underground power and telephone lines (for future installation); improvements&#13;
and extension of the secondary sewerage lines and storm drainage; paving of main and secondary streets,&#13;
sidewalks and footpaths; street-lighting poles and fixtures; garbage collection containers; and community&#13;
facilities. Project total costs (including contingencies) are estimated at US$5.21 million,!' including&#13;
US$0.47 million for detailed preparation and implementation support. The total beneficiary population&#13;
is estimated at about 21,500 persons or about 3,000 households (including hundreds of comunercial&#13;
establishments). Further details are available in the Project File.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Local Government Technical Assistance, Training Strategy and Components&#13;
Strategy&#13;
1.     The approach taken to capacity building under this project has been to establish a process through&#13;
which the EAPC and the local governments would be able to work through complex technical,&#13;
managerial, financial and political issues in an uncertain and difficult environment. This process involves&#13;
the use of Interministerial and high-level Technical Committees as well as local (municipal) Working&#13;
Groups as the fora for guidance, debate, and resolution of the issues of local government legal and&#13;
institutional reform, financial reform and service provision and delivery improvements. In addition, these&#13;
bodies would monitor the implementation of agreed measures and programs and modify them in light of&#13;
experience.&#13;
2.     Although it is anticipated that these bodies will be effective fora for these purposes, it is not&#13;
expected that the committees or the MLG, as their secretariat, will be able to carry out all of the data&#13;
gathering, conceptualizing and analyses that will be necessary to enable the committees to discharge their&#13;
mandates. Consequently, it has been recognized that resources for the hiring of consultants must be a&#13;
necessary part of the support to the work of these committees.&#13;
3.     Experience indicates that the nature of the issues and the context in which they will need to be&#13;
resolved will result in somewhat disjointed progress, and demands on analytical services that will not&#13;
always be easy to predict. This situation requires substantial flexibility in the availability, responsiveness,&#13;
length and intensity of efforts of the consultants in order to ensure timeliness and appropriate focus in&#13;
responding to the opportunities and constraints that the committees will face. In addition, familiarity with&#13;
local conditions, while always helpful in providing assistance, is vital under the circumstances of WBG.&#13;
As a result, it is proposed that the type of arrangement entered into with the suppliers of services reflect&#13;
these requirements for flexibility and responsiveness. Under these arrangements, MLG, as the secretariat&#13;
to the national level committees, and the individual selected municipalities, would enter into contracts&#13;
with each selected supplier that would specify the quantity of the various type of resources that would&#13;
be anticipated, the broad nature of the work anticipated, and an agreement on the maximum mobilization&#13;
and response time to various types of requests, as well as the total budgeted for those services. As the&#13;
committees or working groups carry out their work, they would request specific services or products&#13;
through MLG or directly - in the case of the municipalities, from the suppliers. The suppliers would&#13;
provide the outputs - which may be analyses, memoranda, papers, proposals, draft plans, manuals as well&#13;
as training modules and workshops - within agreed timeframes.&#13;
4.     Timing:  With regard to training, suppliers may be given a list of prospective training&#13;
requirements, the target audience, output expectations and context at the inception of contracts so that&#13;
preliminary preparation and testing of materials and module may begin. For all types of services,&#13;
suppliers would agree to contract and make available any outside expertise needed that was not available&#13;
within its organization.&#13;
5.     Fortunately, there are a number of local and regional sources of assistance that would be able to&#13;
fulfill the conditions of responsiveness, flexibility and local knowledge that is called for. These resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
include applied research, technical consulting and training centers within and outside of the universities,&#13;
as well as consulting firms. The mission met with a number of these groups to discuss the proposed&#13;
approach, and received favorable reception.&#13;
6.     The remainder of the annex outlines the TORs for the committees and working groups and&#13;
provides a tentative list of the potential studies that may be undertaken by each. Performance indicators,&#13;
standards and input guidelines are discussed in an Appendix A to this Annex.&#13;
The Interministerial Steering Committee (IMSC)&#13;
7.     This Cabinet Sub-committee will oversee the entire capacity building program.  It will be&#13;
responsible for making recommendations to the full cabinet on policy matters which requires its clearance.&#13;
The membership will consist of all ministries which have a role in the capacity building program,&#13;
including, MLG (Chair), MOF, MPIC, MOJ, MOT, MOI and MOW. The IMSC will meet at least&#13;
quarterly, or more frequently at the request of the Chair, to receive and review progress reports and to&#13;
act on recommendations made to it by the Technical Committees.&#13;
The Legal and Institutional Technical Comnmittee (LITC)&#13;
8.     The objectives of the work of this committee are to: preserve and expand where appropriate,&#13;
legitimate roles and functions of existing municipalities; define compatible roles and functions for&#13;
provinces; establish appropriate roles, functions and rules for the other entities in the local government&#13;
system, including a classification and assignment system; assign proper financial authority to accompany&#13;
responsibilities; establish appropriate accountability systems; and to strengthen the capacity of the overall&#13;
system to carry out its new functions.&#13;
9.     This committee will be responsible for overseeing the formulation of the drafting instructions for&#13;
the new local government law and the preparation of the draft law. Its membership will include, MLG&#13;
(Chair), MOJ, MOF, MOI, three representatives of municipalities and other representatives as determined&#13;
by the EAPC. The LITC would agree on:&#13;
(a) the principles that would determine these instructions, including the structure of the law, that&#13;
is, whether the law will set out the principles and basic parameters of local government&#13;
structure, leaving the details to be issued under regulations (a basic law), or whether all&#13;
pertinent matters would be encompassed within the law (an all-encompassing law);&#13;
(b) the types and levels of local governments, their fundamental governance structure (chief&#13;
executive, legislative or policy-making body, critical administrative appointments) and the&#13;
jurisdiction of their authority;&#13;
(c) the principles that would guide the scope and degree of autonomy at each level;&#13;
(d) principles that will determine assignment of functions, e.g., clarity, the avoidance of&#13;
ambiguity and potential conflicts in responsibility; the treatment of spillover effects; conflict&#13;
resolution mechanisms;&#13;
(e) principle that will determine financing authority and resources, so that financial capacity and&#13;
authority are matched to functions; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
(f) principles of accountability and reporting relationships: to citizens for services, to sources of&#13;
financing for the proper use of funds; and to the EAPC, for the execution of government&#13;
policy and agency functions.&#13;
10.   Having agreed on the principles, the LITC will assign responsibility for preparing the drafting&#13;
instructions to a qualified group which will commit to producing initial and revised drafts on a timetable&#13;
agreed with the committee. The LITC will review the drafts and provide comments until suitable drafting&#13;
instructions have been agreed. These drafting instructions are to be submitted to MOJ for the preparation&#13;
of the draft law. The MOJ may use consulting resources available to the LITC in drafting the law. The&#13;
LITC should inform Cabinet, through the IMSC, of the results of its work.&#13;
11.   The LITC must complete this phase of its work within one month of its appointment. If the LITC&#13;
decides upon a basic law, it will continue in existence to review the draft law to ensure consistency with&#13;
the drafting instructions and to guide and monitor the drafting of regulations to ensure their congruence&#13;
with the principles established. If an all-encompassing law is decided upon, the LITC will expire after&#13;
reviewing the draft law.&#13;
12.   The costs of the operations of the LITC, including expenses and appropriate compensation for&#13;
eligible members, will be supported under the project.  It is anticipated that 35 man-months of&#13;
consultants' services would be required at a total cost of US$0.5 million (see Table 1 below).&#13;
The Fiscal and Financial Technical Committee (FTC)&#13;
13.   The FTC chaired by MOF and including the Ministry of Planning, MLG, the technical ministries&#13;
and PECDAR as well as three representatives of the local governments, will oversee two sets of studies&#13;
and the implementation of their results. The first addresses local government revenues, while the second&#13;
deals with capital investment policy and programming.&#13;
14.   The first component will be directly overseen by a sub-committee of FTC chaired by MOF and&#13;
including, MLG and local government representatives.&#13;
(a) The Local Government Revenue Structure and Strategy Study will review alternatives and&#13;
prepare an implementation plan to improve local government revenues. The FTC will work&#13;
closely with tie Management Technical Committee (see below) as this work, would be&#13;
closely related to the Program Management and the Capital Investment Policy and&#13;
Programming studics.&#13;
(b) The FTC would examine, with the assistance of consultants as necessary, all aspects of local&#13;
recurrent financing, including:&#13;
(i) charges for services;&#13;
(ii) fees; and&#13;
(iii) alternative local taxes, shared taxes and grants transfer schemes.&#13;
(c) The committee will recommnend to Cabinet through the IMSC, a structure and system that&#13;
would be efficient, cost-effective, buoyant and equitable as well as a program of&#13;
implementation. The program would include instruments to monitor impact in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
reconmmend any modification in implementation. The intention is to implement new revenue&#13;
structures in a year after the initiation of the FTC.&#13;
(d) The second component is the Local Government Capital Investment Policy and&#13;
Programming. The FTC, with the assistance of its consultants, will work:&#13;
(i) to rationalize information flows on investment proposals and programs;&#13;
(ii) on the development and application of tools to assess and prioritize investments; and&#13;
(iii) develop resource allocation systems to reflect government sectoral, geographical and&#13;
equity policies.&#13;
(e) The work would be related closely to the studies on local government revenue and program&#13;
management. The studies under this component would establish:&#13;
(i) performance indicators and performance standards for services;&#13;
(ii) national service standards;&#13;
(iii) guidelines on input standards and planning and design procedures for services; and&#13;
(iv) the timeframe within which national service standards targets should be achieved.&#13;
(f) This project would initiate this work by putting its resources through the MOF and&#13;
transferring the analytical tools used in project selection to MLG and PECDAR. Within a&#13;
year, the FTC will arrange to have the other donor projects for local government flowing&#13;
through the same system. During the third year the remaining aspects of the work would be&#13;
completed.&#13;
15.   The cost of the operations of the FTC, including expenses and appropriate compensation for&#13;
eligible members, will be supported under the project.  It is anticipated that 90 man-months of&#13;
consultants' services would be required at a total cost of US$1.3 million (see Table 1 below).&#13;
The Managerial Technical Conmmittee (MTC)&#13;
16.   The MTC chaired by MLG and including representatives of MOF, the technical ministries and&#13;
four local governments representatives, will oversee three sets of activities.&#13;
(a) The first set, Local Government Program Management and Training, will address the&#13;
problems that have resulted in poorly performing local government services. The MTC will&#13;
review and advise on the design of:&#13;
(i) structural;&#13;
(ii) managerial;&#13;
(iii) financial reforms; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
(iv) training.&#13;
(b) At the local level. As is the case with the other components cf this group of activities,&#13;
responsibility for managing the studies in the selected municipalities and implementing the&#13;
results, will be with the municipalities themselves, while the monitoring and synthesis of&#13;
lessons learned and the preparation of the program for implementation in subsequent&#13;
municipalities will be overseen by the MTC. In exercising its responsibilities, the MTC may&#13;
select consultants to assist it which are separate to the consultants working directly with the&#13;
municipalities, however, both sets of consultants will undertake to cooperate in monitoring&#13;
and synthesizing experience. Work would begin on initiation of the project and continue&#13;
throughout its implementation.&#13;
(c) Under the second component, Local Government Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M)&#13;
Programming, the MTC will shepherd the piloting of the development of an operations and&#13;
maintenance program in the five selected municipalities (Gaza City, Hebron, Jenin, Nablus&#13;
and Rafah) and expand the program to the remaining local governments based on lessons&#13;
learned, with the assistance of other donors.&#13;
(d) The pilot phase would be initiated at the start of the project and the expansion phase would&#13;
begin a year later. The management of the pilot activities at the municipalities would rest&#13;
with the selected municipalities themselves, however, the synthesis of lessons learned and the&#13;
preparation of the program for implementation in subsequent municipalities would rest with&#13;
the MTC.&#13;
(e) The third component is a public information and education plan to complement and directly&#13;
support the objectives and other activities of this program. The Local Govermnent Public&#13;
Information Program would provide mechanisms for feedback from the community on&#13;
priorities, strategies and the perceived performance of the program. Responsibilities for&#13;
implementation, monitoring, synthesis and broader dissemination and application will be&#13;
similar to the other components under this committee. Work will begin with the start of the&#13;
project and continue throughout.&#13;
17.   The cost of the operations of the MTC, including expenses and appropriate compensation for&#13;
eligible members, will be supported under the project.  It is anticipated that 185 man-months of&#13;
consultants' services would be required at a total cost of US$2.3 million (see Table 1 below).&#13;
The Legal and Institutional Working Groups (LIWG)&#13;
18.   These municipal level working groups, comprising the mayors and heads of departments, will&#13;
review the difficulties and constraints to efficient operations of the assigned functions of the municipalities&#13;
as a result of the current laws and develop proposals for more appropriate conditions in the new law.&#13;
19.   In addition, the LIWGs will review their functional assignments and develop proposals with&#13;
regard to what are appropriate functions for them to manage, and what relationships should exist between&#13;
themselves and the EAPC and its ministries, with regard to the execution of these functions.&#13;
20.    The LIWGs also will consider the various sources of financing and the instruments available to&#13;
municipalities to effectively exercise responsibility for each service and function allocated to them. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
LIWGs will highlight the weaknesses in the existing systems and develop proposals for more closely&#13;
matching the requirements of assigned functions.&#13;
21.   The working groups also will review the nature and type of accountability that is exercised with&#13;
regard to their functions, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the mechanisms currently&#13;
employed. The LIWGs will develop proposals for more appropriate accountability systems.&#13;
22.    The results of the various reviews and the proposals developed as a consequence, will be&#13;
conveyed to the representatives of municipalities in the LITC. It is anticipated that consultants' services&#13;
would be covered under the LITC.&#13;
The Fiscal and Financial Working Group (FWG)&#13;
23.   The FWGs, comprised of the mayor, finance director, the technical and administrative managers&#13;
in the municipalities and the heads of the service delivery departments and units, will oversee for its&#13;
respective municipality, the work on reviewing the specific costs and revenues of each service being&#13;
provided by the municipality. In particular the FWGs will examine and document the potential impact&#13;
of transferring the delivery of electricity and water supply services to utilities.&#13;
24.   The FWGs will assess:&#13;
(a) the potential impact of restructured arrangements for delivering the remaining services&#13;
through greater involvement of the private sector, including NGOs;&#13;
(b) improved performance in delivering the services which are retained as direct responsibilities&#13;
of the municipalities;&#13;
(c) the potential of restructuring tariffs with improvements in service quality and reliability; and&#13;
(d) in addition, review all fees and taxes to determine for each:&#13;
(i) the yield;&#13;
(ii) the cost of administration, weaknesses in administration and measures and costs&#13;
necessary to improve;&#13;
(iii) the characteristics of who pays, and how much, and who does not pay, and why and the&#13;
amount collected relative to the potential revenue.&#13;
25.   The FWGs will oversee the design and implementation of a revenue improvement program for&#13;
the municipalities based on restructuring the delivery arrangements for services wvherever feasible;&#13;
improved service delivery performance and related tariff adjustments; imprc ed revenue administration,&#13;
de-emphasizing poor yielding, non-cost effective sources, strengthening efforts in potentially productive&#13;
areas, and increased public education.&#13;
26.   The FWG also will carry out an assessment of the investment program needed to achieve specific&#13;
targets in infrastructure coverage and quality over the next five years. In preparing this investment&#13;
program, the FWGs will consider a full range of financing options including private participation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
community contributions, borrowing on the basis of proven net revenue streams, internally generated&#13;
surpluses and potential contributions from the central government.&#13;
27.   In all areas of work, the FWGs will utilize consultants as and when needed. In addition, the&#13;
FWGs will meet regularly (at least once a quarter) with the FTC to discuss findings and to collaborate&#13;
on proposals to effect system-wide improvements. It is anticipated that 75 man-months of consultants'&#13;
services would be required at a total cost of US$1.0 million (see Table 1 below).&#13;
The Managerial Working Group (MWG)&#13;
28.   The MWGs, comprising the mayor and heads of departments, will oversee the work to improve&#13;
the delivery of services to residents of their particular municipality. This working group will review the&#13;
structural, managerial and technical problems that constrain the efficient and reliable delivery of services&#13;
at an appropriate quality to residents.&#13;
29.   In reviewing the structural issues, the MWGs will examine the potential for private sector&#13;
(including NGOs) participation in the delivery of the services. In making this examination, the MWGs&#13;
will consider the relative coverage, reliability, quality and costs to consumers of the services with or&#13;
without private involvement. In particular, the MWGs will bear in mind the limitations on public&#13;
resources available for investment, the difficulties in recruiting qualified staff, political constraints in&#13;
effectively managing service delivery, the need and requirements for ensuring desired performance by&#13;
private providers, including, competition or appropriate regulation.&#13;
30.   Where conditions for successful private participation does not exist, the MWGs will examine the&#13;
alternative of commercialization of the public sector operations to achieve desired efficiencies.&#13;
31.   In assessing managerial and technical problems, the MWGs will consider the information base&#13;
and systems and decision-making processes that govern operations; the adequacy and preparedness of the&#13;
personnel in place to perform the roles required of them and the incentives for them to perform well; the&#13;
adequacy of tools and facilities available to staff for their jobs; the understanding of consumer&#13;
requirements and preferences, and the means available to express those preferences. The MWGs will&#13;
also consider how financial arrangements with regard to the payment for services, affect performance.&#13;
32.   Of particular importance in this review, is the assessment of the quality of existing maintenance&#13;
programs. The MWGs will examine the consequences of inadequate maintenance for the assets of the&#13;
specific municipalities, and project the benefits from improved maintenance. The working groups will&#13;
contact municipalities, such as Nazareth, which have instituted successful maintenance programs, to&#13;
discuss benefitting from their experiences.&#13;
33.   The MWGs also will actively solicit the views of the communities they serve to derive an&#13;
improved mutual understanding of the issues in service provision and delivery. They will prepare and&#13;
implement a systematic program for this purpose.&#13;
34.   In all areas of work, the MWGs will utilize consultants as and when needed. In addition, the&#13;
MWGs will meet regularly (at least once a quarter) with the MTC to discuss findings and progress and&#13;
to collaborate on proposals to effect system-wide improvements. It is anticipated that 180 man-months&#13;
of consultants' services would be required at a total cost of US$2.1 million (see Table 1 below).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
Performance Indicators, Performance Standards and Input Guidelines&#13;
Establishing a System of Accountability&#13;
1.    Central ministries will need to establish indicators that signal whether policies are having intended&#13;
effects. These performance indicators will usually be based on the cumulative effect of achieving&#13;
standards of output from related service delivery systems within a sector. For example, the proposed&#13;
performance indicator for the water supply sector is increased per capita consumption of water. This&#13;
indicator captures the effect of lower relative prices to consumers, greater availability and access to water,&#13;
greater reliability of service delivery, better quality of product and public increased understanding of, and&#13;
participation in, the service operations and benefits. The performance standards for the delivery systems&#13;
that relates to these intended effects include the level of unaccounted for water, the number and timing&#13;
of interruptions in service, the duration of interruptions, and bill collection percentage.&#13;
2.    In establishing performance standards, the ministries also should provide contextual guidelines&#13;
about input and procedures and examples of best, or at least good practice, so that local governments will&#13;
have the basis for assessing their own situation and designing the most feasible approach to achieving the&#13;
policy objectives under their particular circumstances. It is in the establishment of performance standards&#13;
that the system of accountability starts. In many cases, standard procedures based on proven experience&#13;
will be readily replicable, however, there undoubtedly will be many other cases where local governments&#13;
will have to evolve creative solutions. Policy structures will have to consider both sets of possibilities.&#13;
Policy Implementation&#13;
3.    Implementing policy in the context of decentralization involves convincing the people in local&#13;
communities, through their leadership, of the utility of the policy prescription to them.  As a&#13;
consequence, local leaders and officials must be educated to the values and validity of the policies and&#13;
programs suggested to achieve their objectives. Perhaps the best way of accomplishing this task is to give&#13;
local governments the tools and the opportunity to convince themselves. In some cases, this may involve&#13;
helping the local governments to carry out studies and prepare plans for the sector in their jurisdiction;&#13;
quite often, this may be accomplished through training. If the preparation of plans and programs within&#13;
the local governments involves real participation of its commnunities, then these communities in turn&#13;
become knowledgeable about the policies and what outcomes they should expect from the services of the&#13;
sector. Knowledgeable communities contribute substantially to the successful implementation of policy;&#13;
insofar as they hold their local agencies and their leadership accountable for achieving known&#13;
performance standards, they become a vital part of the overall system of accountability.&#13;
Performance Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.     MLG and the technical ministries must monitor the movement of the performance indicators for&#13;
their sectors and the achievement of the related performance standards by district agencies. This&#13;
monitoring serves several useful functions: it allows the ministry to report to the country on progress vis-&#13;
a-vis its mandate, thus, in the example of the water supply sector, it would mean reporting on the&#13;
increase or decrease in consumption, as that indicator summarizes the outcome of all related efforts to&#13;
advance the sector. It allows comparative assessment of, and reporting on, the performance of local&#13;
governments with regard to the aspects for which they are responsible. Other components of the policy&#13;
implementation system such as extending services to the poor would be reported on, and analyzing the&#13;
performance of the various components may indicate particular weaknesses in the policy framework that&#13;
need to be addressed, and may indicate where research is needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
5.    It should therefore be clear that performance monitoring and reporting is the vital core of&#13;
accountability. A complete picture of performance includes an assessment of the inputs that went into&#13;
achieving that level of output. The traditional concern only with tracking (especially financial) inputs,&#13;
is limited even under centralized systems. It is less than helpful under decentralization. The incentives&#13;
to use resources wisely and efficiently at the local government level must come from reinforcing&#13;
responsiveness to communities at every level - among local officials, local political leaders and the central&#13;
government. A scorecard that is open, transparent and available to all provides substantial incentives to&#13;
improvement, and that may be the greatest benefit of accountability. It is important to note that the&#13;
approach described here does not require or involve the central government intruding on the responsibility&#13;
and authority of the local governments. Policy implementation includes ensuring that the role of the local&#13;
governments, the basis on which their performance is evaluated and how their accomplishments compared&#13;
to others, is well understood by their constituents. With that understanding, the pressure to improve local&#13;
government performance should come from constituents - where it belongs.&#13;
Training&#13;
6.     As noted earlier, training is an important mechanism by which central ministries may assist local&#13;
governments to perform their roles and functions. Training also may be a vehicle for selling local&#13;
governments on the policies and programs of a sector. However, the approach to training and the&#13;
development of training programs need to be responsive to different circumstances. Staff within the&#13;
command structure of a ministry may be directed to undergo training. Further, the incentives of training&#13;
in that context may be entirely within the control of the ministry. Training between MLG and local&#13;
government staff must employ new strategies. Training must be seen as helping local governments&#13;
accomplish their objectives; as such, local governments must be consulted about the training to be&#13;
provided and how it is to be delivered. It is appropriate and useful for MLG to prepare initial menus of&#13;
potential training opportunities based on their observations of what are the critical issues faced in policy&#13;
implementation at the municipal local level or below.  However, it is recommended that local&#13;
governments have a substantial input in determining the priority of offerings. It also is useful to have&#13;
consultations with a selection of local government staff on the focus and presentation of training events.&#13;
Like other programs, training should have performance indicators and standards which are monitored and&#13;
the results published.&#13;

Annex 12&#13;
Appendix A&#13;
The Ministry of Local Government (MLG)&#13;
1.    This ministry is responsible for both the implementation of EAPC policy at the local levels and&#13;
the representation of local government issues at the central level. As is the case with most newly&#13;
established central bodies, MLG has been striving to establish a viable role for itself within its mandate,&#13;
with mixed success. The ministry has promoted a number of village councils to municipal status and the&#13;
smaller and weaker municipalities appear to look to the ministry for support, assistance and guidance,&#13;
however, the bigger and more capable municipalities worry that MLG intrudes unduly into their sphere&#13;
of authority. The ambiguity of the legal situation and other factors (discussed in Annex 2) have no doubt&#13;
contributed to this unease, nevertheless, there are reasons to believe that roles acceptable to the various&#13;
interests may readily be negotiated. Among these reasons are the relatively small size of the ministry,&#13;
which precludes a pervasive intrusive role by the MLG and the strong core of its leadership which is&#13;
oriented towards building more autonomous local governments.&#13;
2.     The total staff of the ministry is 134 persons (60%  technical and professional and 40%&#13;
administrative) distributed among the leadership core and its staff functions, five central line departments&#13;
and thirteen provincial offices (see Chart 4 Appendix A on the next page). The Finance and&#13;
Administration Department is divided into two sections, one responsible for MLG's own establishment&#13;
and financial affairs and the other responsible for audits and inspections of accounts of the local&#13;
governments. The Inspectorate and Follow-up Department is responsible for broad performance&#13;
monitoring and for the establishment of new village councils and municipalities. The Planning and Zoning&#13;
Department prepares plans for areas outside of municipalities, but also appears to have some&#13;
responsibility for the plans of municipalities. The Engineering Department is responsible for the review&#13;
of local and regional infrastructure projects. There is potential overlap in the responsibilities of this&#13;
department with those of other central agencies such as PECDAR and the Ministries of Transportation&#13;
and Works; this is an issue to be resolved under the framework proposed by this project. A Research and&#13;
Development Department is planned but is not yet fully functioning. The provincial level offices are&#13;
intended to have representatives of the central departments at that level, thus approximately 13-15 staff&#13;
are proposed for each such office, however, these are currently, lightly staffed (about 3 or 4 staff each).&#13;
3.    In view of current budgetary constraints, MLG proposes to initiate the capacity building program&#13;
by establishing an internal committee of the key department heads and chaired by the Deputy Minister&#13;
to over see the efforts. This committee will have a secretariat with a staff of seven, three and a secretary&#13;
seconded from existing departments and three consultants hired full time under this project. This&#13;
arrangement will be reviewed after six months to determine whether addition resources should be added&#13;
and after a year to determine whether the unit should become part of the MLG establishment.&#13;

MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
1.    The project elements and their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the&#13;
components to be financed by IDA are summarized in Table 1. Recurrent and other local costs financed&#13;
by the EAPC are shown under the heading NIF (non-IDA financed). The General Procurement Notice&#13;
would be published in the UN Development Business.&#13;
2.     All equipment and materials, works and services to be financed under the project jointly, or&#13;
solely, by IDA would be procured in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995&#13;
and as revised in January 1996). WBG manufacturers competing under International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the&#13;
prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove&#13;
that labor, raw materials and component from within WBG account for more than 30 percent of the ex-&#13;
works, ex-factory or off-the-shelf prices. WBG contractors competing under ICB for civil works&#13;
contracts would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 7.5 percent.&#13;
3.    Equipment and materials required for the project will consist of computer systems and&#13;
peripherals, software systems, telecommunications, office equipment, books, training aids and related&#13;
supplies, vehicles for project management and supervision, and tools equipment and spares for project&#13;
sub-components, particularly Maintenance. Contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$250,000 equivalent each will be procured through ICB, using IDA's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents modified to suit the requirements of individual project packages. Contracts for office&#13;
equipment and supplies, and electrical fixtures are likely to be won by local suppliers. International&#13;
shopping (IS) with at least three quotations from three eligible countries will be used for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$250,000 and not to exceed US$1,000,000 in the aggregate. Local&#13;
shopping with at least three quotations will be used for off-the-shelf items costing less than US$25,000&#13;
per package and not to exceed US$500,000 in the aggregate. Direct Contracting (DC) will be allowed&#13;
for items of a proprietary nature or items required to ensure compatibility with the already installed&#13;
equipment.&#13;
4.    Civil works contracts will be packaged taking into account such factors as the nature of the&#13;
works, state of preparation and implementation capacity of local contractors and implementing agencies.&#13;
Works contracts costing less than US$3 million, with the exception of those requiring special construction&#13;
and installation expertise, are not expected to be of interest to foreign contractors. These contracts are&#13;
many ( 60-70), relatively small and widely dispersed geographically, with several implementing agencies--&#13;
mainly the municipalities and PECDAR. Specialized contracts and works contracts costing more than&#13;
US$3 million per contract will be procured through ICB using IDA's Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
Civil Works (Small Contracts) modified to suit the requirements of individual works. All other works&#13;
contracts will be awarded under National Competitive Bidding (NCB, procedures following the&#13;
implementing agei,ies' normal procurement procedures. Very small works, Such as street cleaning,&#13;
trench rehabilitation, -tc., "'ill be done using the municipalities' existing work force. 77he pre-1967&#13;
procurement laws of Egypt (v-th some elements of the Palestine Mandate Law and israeli Civil&#13;
Administration regulations) and Jordan are in force in Gaza and the West Bank, respectively. The&#13;
procurement procedures described by these laws are being followed by the municipalities and local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
administrative units. These are satisfactory to IDA with the following provisos: (i) tenders will be&#13;
advertised for at least two consecutive days in a local newspaper of wide circulation; (ii) prospective&#13;
bidders will be allowed a minimum of 30 days between the first appearance of notification and bid&#13;
submission; (iii) bidding documents will follow the formats of IDA's Standard Bidding Documents; (iv)&#13;
if interested, foreign bidders will be allowed to submit bids, and will not be required to have local agents&#13;
to be able to participate in bidding; (v) bids will be submitted in sealed envelopes, and both mailed and&#13;
hand-carried bids will be accepted; (vi) all bids will be opened at the same time in public; (vii) contracts&#13;
will be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder; (viii) bidders will not be asked, nor allowed, to change&#13;
the substance of their bids after the bid closing date, and price negotiations with the lowest evaluated&#13;
bidder will be confined to those cases listed in IDA's Procurement Guidelines; and (ix) in the absence&#13;
of prequalification, postqualification criteria will be explicitly stated in the bidding documents.&#13;
5.     Consultancy assignments will involve both individual consultants, consulting firms and&#13;
departments of West Bank universities. The selection of consultants will be in accordance with the&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981), using IDA's standardized Letter of Invitation (LOI) and Sample Form of Contract&#13;
for Consultants' Services [or the standard form of contract used when IDA is the Executing Agency].&#13;
There will be a total of about 30-40 assignments valued at about US$14.5 million. Major assignments&#13;
will be for: inter-city roads implementation; detailed preparation of core sub-projects in water,&#13;
wastewater, sanitation and municipal roads sectors; detailed preparation of the maintenance and upgrading&#13;
sub-programs; and numerous consultancy assignments directed at assisting the LG reform process (Part&#13;
"B" of the project) at both central and local levels. Training services will be obtained mostly through&#13;
local consulting organizations and the universities, or through specialized UN agencies such as ILO.&#13;
There are several local consultants (including the management departments of the universities) with the&#13;
requisite experience and background. Therefore, their participation in the project assignments is expected&#13;
to be high.&#13;
6.    Due to PECDAR's experience with international commercial practices and IDA's procurement&#13;
procedures (acquired under ERP), all significant procurement activities under the project will be&#13;
coordinated by or with PECDAR. PECDAR's Procurement Unit will be responsible for (i) coordinating&#13;
and monitoring all procurement activities of the implementing agencies; (ii) taking actions required by&#13;
the Grant Agreement's prior or post review provisions; (iii) conducting all ICB and Technical Assistance&#13;
related procurement; and (iv) maintaining the records required for accountability in the use of grant&#13;
funds. To ensure compliance with IDA's Procurement Guidelines, all contracts awarded through ICB,&#13;
as well as all civil works contracts above US$250,000 and all consultant appointments above US$100,000&#13;
for consulting firms and US$50,000 for individuals, and the first two contracts of each implementing&#13;
agency will be subject to prior IDA review. These limits would result in prior review of a sufficiently&#13;
large number of contracts (approximately 90 percent of all procurement contracts) to ensure that IDA's&#13;
Procurement Guidelines are followed. In addition, all other contracts will be subject to selective ex-post&#13;
review by IDA.&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
1.    APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEDURES AND REVIEW PROCESS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    An IDA mission to the West Bank and Gaza appraised the Municipal Infrastructure Development&#13;
Project (MIDP) during February 1996. This team included an environmental specialist from the Resident&#13;
Mission; consultations on specific issues were conducted at the field level with an enviromnental specialist&#13;
from the Environment Department of the Bank. The mission undertook, in cooperation with Palestinian&#13;
counterparts, a review of environmental aspects of activities to be supported in the proposed project.&#13;
During this period they conducted a series of site visits, and reviewed lists of potential sub-projects to&#13;
be considered for support under the proposed project.&#13;
2.    Applicability of Enviromnental Procedures. The following environrnental procedures would&#13;
apply to the review and implementation of the proposed project: (a) World Bank/IDA procedures&#13;
conceming environment, resettlement and cultural heritage as outlined in Operational Directive, 4.01,&#13;
"Environmental Assessment;" Operational Directive, 4.30 "Involuntary Resettlement;" and the guidance&#13;
of the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook and its Updates; (b) for Gaza, the pre-1967 legislation of&#13;
the Government of Egypt concerning water quality inspections by health authorities and provisions for&#13;
the protection of antiquities and historical monuments; and (c) for the West Bank, the pre-1967 legislation&#13;
of the Government of Jordan concerning water quality inspections by health authorities and provisions&#13;
for protection of antiquities and historical monuments.&#13;
3.    Development of New Procedures. The procedures of Egypt and Jordan would be phased out&#13;
of use as environmental procedures and guidelines are developed and issued for use by the Palestinian&#13;
Authority. The development of new environmental legislation and procedures, including environmental&#13;
standards and environmental assessment guidelines for use by the Palestinian Authority, is currently being&#13;
undertaken by the Environmental Planning Directorate (EPD) of the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
International Cooperation (MPIC); the Palestinian Department of Antiquities (PDA) of the Ministry of&#13;
Tourism and Antiquities (MTA) and the Ministry of Culture (MOC) are developing complementary&#13;
legislation and procedures for the conservation of cultural heritage. The Bank supported Technical Trust&#13;
Fund (TATF) and a number of donors are supporting these activities.&#13;
4.    Enviromnental Screening Category. The activities to be supported under the proposed project&#13;
have been reviewed with regard to the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment." The activities to be included in the proposed project have been placed in environmental&#13;
screening category "B" due to their limited scope and the restricted nature of their potential impacts. It&#13;
should be noted that feasibility studies for sub-projects to be included in the MIDP, will include the&#13;
preparation of reviews of potential environmental impacts and resettlement issues, and measures for the&#13;
protection of cultural heritage, consistent with IDA guidelines. The preparation of environmental&#13;
assessments (environmental screening category "A"), would be required if sub-projects are later identified&#13;
that support the construction of new large scale water supply reservoirs, water treatment plants,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
wastewater treatment plants and reuse systems, major roads or other types of new infrastructure which&#13;
have potentially significant environmental impacts.&#13;
5.     Applicability of Other Directives. A review was conducted concerning the possible application&#13;
of Operational Directive. 4.30, "Involuntary Resettlement" to activities to be supported under the&#13;
proposed project. At present, there are no sub-project proposals whose implementation is anticipated to&#13;
result in involuntary resettlement; however, a number of activities will require the purchase by local&#13;
authorities of privately-held land from its owners. No known archaeological or historical sites are&#13;
anticipated to be affected by activities to be supported under the proposed project. However, given the&#13;
high density of archaeological and historical sites in the West Bank and Gaza, provisions will be made&#13;
in construction contracts for the use of "chance find" procedures should archaeological or historical&#13;
materials be discovered in the course of project implementation.&#13;
6.     Activity Review Process. IDA environmental assessment procedures would be used for the&#13;
review process until the Palestinian environmental assessment procedures are available for use, at which&#13;
time both sets of procedures would be in effect for project activities. Proposed activities to be supported&#13;
under the project would be subject to an environmental screening and review process which would be&#13;
coordinated by the environmental specialist assigned to the staff of the Palestinian Economic Council for&#13;
Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR), in coordination with representatives of EPD, PDA and&#13;
IDA. Proposed project activities, as appropriate, would be subject to the preparation of environmental&#13;
reviews consistent with category "B" project activities. To facilitate effective coordination with EPD and&#13;
PDA, direct contacts would be established with their representatives based in Ramallah for the West Bank&#13;
and Gaza City for Gaza.&#13;
7.     Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies supported under the proposed project for possible support&#13;
under future projects supported by IDA or other donor organizations would include the preparation of&#13;
environmental assessments or environmental reviews consistent with the requirements of EPD (when&#13;
available) and IDA. Formnal clearances would be obtained from the EPD and PDA for all sub-projects&#13;
proposed for funding under the project, consistent with current Palestinian environmental and cultural&#13;
heritage procedures. The Ministries of Local Government, Transport and Works along with the five&#13;
selected municipalities would be responsible for supervision of the implementation of required mitigation&#13;
and monitoring activities. Their performance of these functions would be periodically reviewed by EPD,&#13;
PDA and IDA. A set cf the sub-project environmental documents would be maintained by both PECDAR&#13;
and the Resident Mission which would include the environmental reviews, clearance letters from EPD&#13;
and PDA, and otlher appropriate documentation.&#13;
I.    REVIEW  OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND ACTIONS&#13;
A.    Programs with Enviromunental Concerns&#13;
(i)    Water and Wastewater Sector Program.&#13;
8.     Overview.  Activities to be supported under the proposed project would be focused on the&#13;
rehabilitation and completion or expansion of existing water and wastewater facilities. The project would&#13;
not provide for the construction of new wastewater treatment plants or sludge disposal facilities prior to&#13;
a detailed examniationi of interventions in this area, including their potential beneficial and adverse&#13;
environmental impacts.  Where possible, the project would draw on the expertise of previously&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
established environmental monitoring systems to routinely monitor the quality of water and wastewater&#13;
at the level of the water and wastewater utility.&#13;
9.     Water Interventions. The proposed program of interventions in the water and wastewater sector&#13;
would have significant benefits to environmental health and environmental quality and would support the&#13;
conservation of limited water resources. Improvements to water supply, including the rehabilitation of&#13;
wells and disinfection systems, would result in more reliable access to safer water and reduce&#13;
contamination at source. Rehabilitation of distribution systems would allow for conservation of water&#13;
resources which are presently lost due to leaks. Expansion of piped water coverage to selected villages&#13;
would provide access to safer water and would improve health and overall living standards. Asbestos&#13;
cement pipes have been widely used in the West Bank and Gaza due to their low cost and durability.&#13;
Under the project they would only be replaced and/or repaired in locations where structural damage has&#13;
occurred or is anticipated due to physical conditions. Improved pressure and reliability of water supplies&#13;
would reduce infiltration of wastewater into water pipes during periods of negative pressure.&#13;
Establishment of a routine maintenance program should enhance the reliability and quality of the water&#13;
distributed.&#13;
10.    Wastewater Collection Interventions. Rehabilitation and expansion of the wastewater collection&#13;
networks would improve collection and conveyance of wastewater. Expanded and improved collection&#13;
networks would reduce present direct discharges to the groundwater table from vaults, abandoned cesspits&#13;
and leakage from poorly maintained collection systems. This intervention would reduce the periodic&#13;
flooding of streets with untreated wastewater and lower punlic health risks resulting from contact with&#13;
these materials. Establishment of facilities for wastewater testing would allow for the more accurate&#13;
characterization of wastewater which would be especially important in the long-term given their potential&#13;
for reuse.&#13;
Il.    Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Studies. The proposed support program would also include&#13;
review of existing and proposed investments in new and/or expanded wastewater treatment facilities. For&#13;
this purpose specialized consultants would be retained to review existing and proposed wastewater&#13;
treatment facilities, concerning their design standards, reliability of operation under local conditions and&#13;
possibilities for reuse of treated wastewater for groundwater recharge, irrigated agriculture and other&#13;
beneficial uses. They would be responsible for the preparation of modified or new process designs which&#13;
would include provisions for sludge treatment and monitoring of wastewater from the plants and within&#13;
reuse schemes.  These interventions would be implemented as priority steps to address control of&#13;
pollution now resulting from  the discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewater to surface&#13;
discharge points such as seasonally wet river beds ("wadis"). These studies would include: reviewing&#13;
the adequacy of provisions under existing legislation with respect to relevant current and future industrial&#13;
pollution issues and proposing improvements where necessary; and evaluating measures required for the&#13;
current and future control of industrial discharges in order to assure that the municipal wastewater flows&#13;
could be safely used for restricted reuse.&#13;
12.    Environmental Review of Proposed Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Activities. Provisions&#13;
have been made in the terms of reference for the consultants to include the preparation of environmental&#13;
reviews, as required by IDA Operational Directive, 4.01, "Environmental Assessment." The reviews&#13;
would address environmental concerns in an integrated manner as a key element of treatment technology&#13;
evaluation, site selection, plant design, system operation and monitoring. Environmental reviews would&#13;
be prepared with reference to the guidance provided in the IDA Environmental Assessment Sourcebook,&#13;
Volume 11, "Wastewater Collection. Treatment, Reuse and Disposal Systems," pages 231-244. Special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
attention would be given to analysis of potential risks to effective wastewater reuse presented by the&#13;
current and/or potential discharge of industrial wastewaters with or without pre-treatment into municipal&#13;
collection and treatment systems. Contractors would be briefed concerning measures to be taken should&#13;
they have "chance finds" of archaeological or historical materials&#13;
B.    Programs with Minor Environmental Issues&#13;
(i)    Regional Roads&#13;
13.   Proposed activities would focus on rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing road network&#13;
which is in serious disrepair. Potential direct environmental impacts would be limited to the proper&#13;
disposal of construction wastes from road repair and resurfacing operations. Measures would be required&#13;
to ensure that the proper disposal of these materials is monitored as an element of project supervision.&#13;
Contractors would be briefed concerning measures to be taken should they have "chance finds" of&#13;
archaeological or historical materials.&#13;
(ii)    Municipal and Village Roads&#13;
14.   The proposed program  would support the rehabilitation and upgrading of roads within&#13;
municipalities as well as village access and internal roads. The rehabilitation of such roads would include&#13;
improvements to surface drainage in areas with high potential for flooding. The road rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading program would be anticipated to have minor environmental impact provided good design,&#13;
safety and supervision practices are implemented. Contractors would be briefed concerning measures to&#13;
be taken should they have "chance finds" of archaeological or historical materials.&#13;
(iii)   Maintenance Program&#13;
15.   The proposed program  would support the establishment of maintenance programs for&#13;
infrastructure assets at municipal level. This program would introduce activities that would ensure that&#13;
municipal services are regularly maintained to provide acceptable levels of service delivery. The&#13;
maintenance program is anticipated to have little environmental impact provided that good design, safety&#13;
and supervision practices are adopted and implemented.&#13;
(iv)   Neighborhood Upgrading Program&#13;
16.   The proposed neighborhood upgrading component would focus on providing basic infrastructure,&#13;
services and maintenance to existing lower-income communities where land tenure ownership or rights&#13;
are not in dispute or needing resolution. A range of basic improvements that would be provided are&#13;
intended to rapidly improve living conditions, remove hazards and enhance environmental conditions.&#13;
The project would support a wide range of small-scale activities, sometimes undertaken with direct&#13;
participation of the beneficiaries at the neighborhood level, which would have minimal adverse&#13;
environmental or social impact. The upgrading works would be designed so as to prevent the relocation&#13;
of residents, although there may be isolated cases where some temporary relocation during construction&#13;
may be necessary. Contractors and community residents would be briefed concerning measures to be&#13;
taken should they have "chance finds" of archaeological or historical materials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17&#13;

C.    Special Issue - Construction Materials Industry&#13;
17.   Implementation of the proposed project would require the extensive use of local construction&#13;
materials. Currently in both the West Bank and Gaza the illegal quarrying of rock, gravel and sand is&#13;
a serious problem resulting in considerable damage to public and private property. The illegal removal&#13;
of massive quantities of sand in Gaza has been identified by the EPD as a major environmental&#13;
management problem in coastal and inland sites. The PDA has also identified these operations as a major&#13;
cause of destruction, especially in Gaza, of antiquities. In addition, inadequately supervised rock, gravel&#13;
and sand operations could result in locally significant air pollution from dust, water pollution from&#13;
improper disposal of lubricants from heavy equipment, and localized flooding during storms due to the&#13;
transport of poorly controlled sediment from excavation sites into surface drainage features. While the&#13;
proposed project would not directly fund these operations, actions would be taken with local authorities&#13;
and contractors to attempt to minimize these problems. To support this objective, measures would be&#13;
adopted under the proposed project to assure that, to the extent possible under local conditions,&#13;
construction materials used are being collected from authorized sites which comply with Palestinian&#13;
environmental and cultural heritage procedures.&#13;
D.    Training in Environmental Review&#13;
18.   In order to support effective implementation of the proposed project, a series of three-day training&#13;
courses on the application of the Bank's procedures for environmental assessment, resettlement and&#13;
cultural heritage would be conducted in cooperation with EPD, PDA and the implementing agencies.&#13;
These courses would be conducted in Arabic and make use of the recently completed translations of&#13;
relevant Operational Directives, the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (3 volumes) and selected&#13;
updates to the Sourcebook, including those on coastal zone management and cultural heritage. The&#13;
training sessions would use special training materials which are currently being prepared in Arabic and&#13;
would benefit from the experience gained from the EPD/EDI/MNA/ENV sponsored training seminar on&#13;
coastal zone management held in Gaza in 1995. These training activities would be coordinated with those&#13;
being supported by other organizations, especially CIDA, DANIDA and GTZ. Specific nieasures would&#13;
be taken to assure that the proposed IDA-supported training seminars fully complement the short-term&#13;
and international training activities for the water and wastewater sector, including environmental issues,&#13;
being undertaken by GTZ in the West Bank, Gaza and Germany.&#13;
E.    Coordination with Ongoing Activities&#13;
19.   Implementation of the proposed project would be coordinated with, but not limited to, the&#13;
following on-going activities:&#13;
(a)    Physical Planning Study. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation is&#13;
preparing a physical planning study for the West Bank and Gaza, including special studies&#13;
for Jericho, Ramallah and Gaza City, with support from the Government of Norway;&#13;
(b)    Tourism Development Program. The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities plans to&#13;
undertake preparation of a tourism development program for the West Bank and Gaza.&#13;
This activity is to be supported under the Technical Assistance Trust Fund (TATF);&#13;

WEST BANK AND GAZA&#13;
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis and Monitoring&#13;
1.    The economic evaluation analyses the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improveement component&#13;
of the project representing 79 percent of total project cost (US$35.6 million). Among expected benefits,&#13;
only the quantifiable ones have been measured. The three components of Part A have been analyzed&#13;
separately: (a) the Rehabilitation and Improvement Program (US$22.9 million); (b) the Maintenance&#13;
Program  (US$7.5 million); and (c) the Neighborhood Upgrading Program  (US$5.2 million).  A&#13;
description of the evaluation methods, results and examples is presented below. Cost streams include&#13;
civil works, equipment and machines, engineering design and provisions for operation and maintenance.&#13;
Economic costs and benefits are expressed as base costs net of all taxation (in US$ at January 1, 1996&#13;
prices).&#13;
Rehabilitation and Improvement Program&#13;
2.     Situation and objectives. The infrastructure rehabilitation component of the project is focused&#13;
on three major municipal services: namely, water, wastewater and roads. The investment program&#13;
proposed originally by the municipalities and PECDAR totalled US$600 million. Given the limited&#13;
availability of resources, it was critical to establish a system to derive a refined list. The strategy adopted&#13;
was to establish a hierarchy of filters to sift the proposed projects in stages (See Table 1: Screening&#13;
process). The first step was the state of preparation of the projects. Only projects that would be ready&#13;
for tender within 18 months (i.e., before July 1997) and ready for implementation within three years were&#13;
considered. The next filter was to eliminate projects already considered by other donors. At this stage,&#13;
the size of the program had been reduced to US$260 million.!' Available resources were still far from&#13;
being able to fund this potential volume of infrastructure projects, consequently it was important to select&#13;
the most economically beneficial of these projects.&#13;
3.     The next criterion utilized within the screening process, therefore, was the economic feasibility&#13;
of projects. The cost of capital for WBG is estimated by the Country Economist at 10 percent.&#13;
However, given the large number of projects proposed, it was appropriate to raise the hurdle to ensure&#13;
that the highest value cohort would be considered for further analyses. Consequently, an ERR of 14&#13;
percent was established as the desirable threshold.  As a result, investments selected under the&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation sub-component, which represents two-thirds of the total project cost, all&#13;
exceed this rate of return.&#13;
4.     Given the large number of projects proposed, a specific survey underpinning every project was&#13;
not feasible.  Therefore, three approaches (for water, waste water and roads, respectively) were&#13;
developed to assess the projects.  Projects were classified into categories associated with standard&#13;
conditions. Specific models were established for these categories based on assumptions discussed with&#13;
local engineers (see details below). For projects ready for implementation, any project specific data&#13;
available was taken into account and the model adapted whenever necessary. For projects less ready,l'&#13;
1/    The list of all projects considered is in the Project file.&#13;
2/     Generally projects whose documents will not be ready within 6 months.&#13;
&#13;

the economic evaluation provides only an indication of their economic feasibility and it is not intended&#13;
to eliminate projects at this stage as it is based on rough estimations of benefits and costs. In these cases,&#13;
poor preliminary results should be seen as an incentive to carefully design and re-evaluate projects to try&#13;
to secure their econonmic feasibility.&#13;
5.     The next filter was to ensure that selected projects would meet the following three conditions:&#13;
(a) consistency with sector strategy and related projects; (b) environmental impact and health factors&#13;
assessed as positive; and (c) institutional arrangements for operation and maintenance established. The&#13;
final stage was to select projects responding to community social priorities and confirmed by local&#13;
communities as being of high priority to them. Special attention was given to geographical distribution&#13;
equity. Frorn a longer term perspective, these evaluation criteria are intended to help local authorities&#13;
in their own screening process for future investment. The methodology and models used in this analysis&#13;
and presented below will be transferred to MLG and PECDAR for their use.&#13;
Economic Evaluation Methodology&#13;
6.     The three approaches developed evaluate project benefits and estimate project economic rate of&#13;
return. All benefits could not be taken into consideration as some were not quantifiable. For instance,&#13;
health improvement has not been quantified due to the scarcity of information on water-borne diseases,&#13;
though it is a major benefit of water and wastewater projects. Positive environmental impact could&#13;
neither be taken into account without further survey though it is a major public benefit. Consequently,&#13;
benefits have been consistently understated. Provisions for operation and maintenance costs (O&amp;M) are&#13;
included into the cost streams as a fixed percentage of total sub-project cost. Supporting data for&#13;
economic analysis are in the Project File (Annex 19).&#13;
Water Projects&#13;
7.     Fifty sub-projects have been proposed involving exclusively the West Bank as a Bank-supported&#13;
water project is underway in the Gaza strip. These sub-projects totalled altogether US$21.4 million. On&#13;
the basis of current information, thirty-nine projects have an ERR above 14%, with costs totalling&#13;
US$15.8 million. The 22 projects selected to be funded under the core program totalled altogether&#13;
US$9.65 million. A description of the model and assumptions is presented below, followed by sensitivity&#13;
analyses and examples.&#13;
8.     Water sub-projects have been classified according to three categories: (a) creation or expansion&#13;
of water network; (b) pumps and reservoirs; and (c) rehabilitation/upgrading of network. The benefits&#13;
assessed were: (i) provision of piped water; (ii) increase in property value; (iii) increased provision of&#13;
water, and (iv) reduction of water losses. Each kind of sub-project provides a solution of benefits from&#13;
the set of these four. For projects combining discrete investments with associated benefits, separate ERRs&#13;
have been computed for each type of investment when distinct cost estimates were available. The final&#13;
ERR of such a project is a weighted average of sub-projects ERRs. Project life is estimated at 30 years;&#13;
no salvage value is taken into account. Provisions for O&amp;M costs have also been estimated according&#13;
to sub-project types: 3 percent for reservoirs, 5 percent for networks, pumps and main pipes and 4&#13;
percent when reservoir and network are combined and no detailed costs are available. The estimates of&#13;
potential water consumption are based on comparison with Jordan where the demand for water has been&#13;
estimated recently at 120 liters/day/capita. Currently water demand is not met in most villages and&#13;
municipalities of the West Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
9.     New network or expansion of network. Network investments will provide water in municipalities&#13;
and villages replacing expensive delivery by tankers. The major benefit is the provision of water at lower&#13;
cost for users (benefit estimated at US$40 per capita per year over the network lifetime). A second&#13;
benefit assessed is an immediate increase in property values (estimated at US$144 per household). The&#13;
current consumption from tankers is estimated at 20 liters/day/capita (l/d/c) both in villages and&#13;
municipalities. The water collected in private tanks is not taken into account in the model. The economic&#13;
cost of water from tankers is assumed to be NIS 15 per m3 (US$4.78 per i3), which is an average of&#13;
tanker prices encountered in WBG. When no project specific information is available, consumption after&#13;
completion of the project is expected to be 50 I/d/c both in villages and municipalities, not including&#13;
water coming from private collection tanks. This assumption is rather conservative, however, water&#13;
resources are limited and there is no evidence that the provision would necessarily be higher. Water&#13;
provided by the project is valued at NIS 3 per m3, which is an average of existing user charges in West&#13;
Bank. This benefit is taken annually over the assumed life of the network (30 years).&#13;
10.    The provision of water will also increase the value of dwelling units. The size of a household&#13;
is on average 7 persons in villages and 6 in municipalities. The number of households is estimated from&#13;
the number of beneficiaries, using these averages. The net increase in property values as a result of&#13;
good, piped supplies is estimated locally at US$1.80 per m2.3' The average dwelling unit area is 80m2.&#13;
The derived benefit of US$144 per household (See Appendix) is taken into account for the year following&#13;
project completion. These standard assumptions have been adapted when additional data was available.&#13;
For example, in Farkha (Nablus district), current consumption from tankers was estimated by the&#13;
authorities at 30 I/d/c, at NIS 20 per m3.&#13;
11.    Pumps and reservoirs. These projects are undertaken when there are shortages of water and a&#13;
need for emergency storage. The quantified benefit of pumps and reservoirs is an increased provision&#13;
of water (estimated at US$5 per capita per year, under standard estimates). Therefore, such projects also&#13;
imply higher water losses if there is no rehabilitation of the network. When no project specific data are&#13;
available, water consumption is estimated to increase from 60 I/d/c to 90 I/d/ in villages and from 90 to&#13;
120 in cities, as demand is currently not met. In both cases, the additional water provided is valued at&#13;
NIS 3 per m3. The percentage of unaccounted for water is set at 55% and is unchanged unless a&#13;
rehabilitation is underway. The increase in consumption is estimated in relationship to the known&#13;
capacity of the reservoir.&#13;
12.    Rehabilitation/Upgrading of network.  The first benefit of rehabilitation (estimated between&#13;
US$3 to US$5 per capita per year) is to provide consumers with more water as the percentage of&#13;
unaccounted for water is reduced. The rehabilitation may also enhanice the capacity of the network&#13;
introducing a second benefit from an increase in the provision of water (estimated globally between&#13;
US$10 to US$12 per capita per year). The current percentage of unaccounted for water is assumed to&#13;
be 55 percent. It is estimated to be reduced to 40 percent under the rehabilitation.4' The current&#13;
consumption is 60 I/d/c in villages and 90 I/d/c in municipalities. When the capacity of the network is&#13;
increased, the provision of 30 additional liters/d/c is expected and will satisfy the demand currently not&#13;
met. It should be noted that while increasing the provision of water, water losses may increase if&#13;
unaccounted for water is not reduced. The formula chosen take this cost into account. When project&#13;
specific data was available, the standard assumptions were adapted to each case.&#13;
3/     The increase in property value is estimated at $ 2 per m2, a 10 percent tax is applied on the value of the&#13;
dwelling when it is sold.&#13;
4/     Assistance to develop an appropriate strategy to manage losses is proposed under the Maintenance Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
13.    Risks. The benefits expected from these investments rely on improved management of water&#13;
services. A strategy has been developed to this purpose (Annex l). The strengthening of existing&#13;
utilities, the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, as well as the improvement of operation and&#13;
maintenance programs, will be supported through this Project. The management of water resources at&#13;
a regional level will be supported under a future West Bank Water and Wastewater Project, as it is&#13;
currently undertaken for Gaza under a Bank supported project.'&#13;
14.    Sensitivity analyses.  Increasing all project costs by 10 percent would reduce the number of&#13;
acceptable projects by 2, costing US$1.2 million. These two rates of return are decreased by 2 percent.&#13;
However, these two projects still have rates of return above the cost of capital (10 percent). Rates of&#13;
return between 14 percent and 25 percent are reduced by 2 to 3 percent. Higher rates of return are more&#13;
sensitive but remain well above 14 percent. Decreasing all project benefits by 10 percent will reduce&#13;
similarly the number of acceptable projects. Rates of return are slightly more reduced under this test (by&#13;
3 to 4 percent when ranging between 14 and 25 percent). Under combined cost increases and benefit&#13;
reductions, the number of acceptable projects would be reduced by 8, totalling US$2.8 million. Rates&#13;
of return are reduced by 4 to 5 percent for these eight projects. Projects whose economic feasibility was&#13;
done with rough estimates of benefits and costs because of their state of preparation will have to be&#13;
reevaluated when detailed information is available.&#13;
15.    Examples:&#13;
Creation of a water network. The proposed project in Deir Bzei and Kufr Naimeh (Ramallah district)&#13;
is to create a water network to benefit 3,607 people. Total project cost is US$700,000. The economic&#13;
rate of return of the project under standard assumptions is 19 percent. The cost per beneficiary is slightly&#13;
below US$200 per capita and seems reasonable for the area (see Table 2: Cost and Benefit Streams).&#13;
Pumps and reservoirs. A reservoir is proposed in Beita (Nablus district), benefiting the whole population&#13;
(5,766 people). Total project cost is US$200,000. The capacity of the reservoir is 500m3, it was&#13;
estimated that the provision of water would increase by 40 I/d/c. Based on this estimation, the economic&#13;
rate of return is 17 percent.&#13;
Rehabilitation of network. A rehabilitation is proposed in A'ttil (Tulkarem district) benefiting 9,373&#13;
people with a net cost estimated at US$400,000. The ERR is 20 percent. No additional data was&#13;
available, standard assumptions have not been changed.&#13;
Wastewater Component&#13;
16.     Thirty-two projects have been proposed involving only the West Bank, as a Bank-supported&#13;
water and wastewater project is underway in the Gaza strip. The projects total US$117.6 million. Out&#13;
of the evaluated projects, 10 fulfill the economic criterion, totalling US$23.5 million.t' The projects that&#13;
do not pass this criteria or those for which very little information was available should be re-estimated&#13;
carefully and re-evaluated when further project specific information is available. The method used is&#13;
presented below.&#13;
5/     Gaza Water and Wastewater Service Improvement Project.&#13;
6/     Most treatment plants increasing greatly the total amount of proposed projects did not pass as major&#13;
benefits such as the reuse of water have not been assessed because the projects were not precisely defined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
17.    The major economic benefits of treatment plants, sewage network and pumping stations are health&#13;
improvement and environmental benefits. Given the large number of projects, no major survey on social&#13;
benefits could be undertaken. Therefore, no data was available to quantify any of these spill-over benefits&#13;
to screen wastewater sub-projects. For each sub-project, the minimum annual cost recovery per capita&#13;
to secure a 14 percent ERR has been estimated. The input required are the project cost and the number&#13;
of beneficiaries. The life-time of wastewater works was estimated at 30 years. Provisions for O&amp;M&#13;
were taken as 15 percent of the total project cost. Thirty-two sub-projects have been classified into four&#13;
groups: treatment plant, wastewater network, treatment plant and wastewater network combined and&#13;
pumping station. One project is different from any other: a main storm water drain in Wadi Ain&#13;
Munjid.&#13;
18.    Currently, sewage fees are not charged efficiently to recover the cost of the network.&#13;
Municipalities estimate the household willingness to pay at about US$11 per household per month, or on&#13;
average US$18 per capita per year. (Poor collection of fees will be addressed under the capacity building&#13;
component.) Households are likely to pay for immediate benefits but they are less willing to pay for&#13;
major externalities, such as improved environment and better public health. However, untreated or&#13;
inadequately treated wastewater presents serious health and environmental risks. The scarcity of water&#13;
resources in the region could be partly answered by the development of reuse programs. Therefore,&#13;
estimating that these spill-over benefits paid for from general revenues could represent 50 percent of the&#13;
estimated cost recovery, a ceiling of US$36 per capita, per year was chosen as the maximum plausible&#13;
benefit. This is consistent with current practice showing that a reasonable cost for sewage services is&#13;
about US$35 per capita, per year (total capital cost annualized over the life of the network). Increasing&#13;
the project costs by 10 percent does not eliminate any passing project.  Two projects totalling&#13;
US$12.5 million are eliminated by a 20 percent increase in cost and a 5 percent increase in O&amp;M.&#13;
19.    The annual cost recovery necessary to secure a 14 percent rate of return for the projects selected&#13;
to be funded under the project does not exceed US$18.5 per capita per year. Therefore these projects&#13;
easily pass the economic criterion. None of these projects will fall out from the sensitivity analyses.&#13;
Road Component&#13;
20.    One hundred and ten road sub-projects have been proposed for funding, totalling US$118 million&#13;
(90 million in West Bank and 28 in Gaza strip)."' Ninety-eight projects with costs totalling US$108&#13;
million fulfill the economic criterion of an ERR above 14 percent. The 28 projects to be funded under&#13;
the project itself total altogether US$24.8 million. The method for evaluating road project ERRs is&#13;
presented below, followed by sensitivity analyses and examples.&#13;
21.    Road projects have been classified according to two criteria: first, the kind of road and secondly,&#13;
the type of work to be done. First, roads are either regional, village access, village internal or city&#13;
internal ones. Secondly, the project can be classified under reconstruction, rehabilitation or maintenance&#13;
works. A project is classified under reconstruction when a major improvement is undertaken, for&#13;
example when paving an earth road, changing the curvature or the slope or, widening the road. A&#13;
rehabilitation or upgrading project improves greatly the road surface condition (mainly new overlays)&#13;
without modifying the main characteristics of the road. Maintenance is mostly patching and small&#13;
overlaying.&#13;
7/     About 80 percent of the projects have a base cost below US$1.5 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Antnex 18&#13;
Page 6 of 12&#13;
22.    The road model was developed to check which projects would pass the economic criterion. For&#13;
each project, four specific inputs are required: (a) the length of the portion to be improved; (b) the&#13;
estimated cost; (c) the average daily traffic (ADT); and (d) the classification according to the two criteria&#13;
described above. These parameters are currently the only available data on each investment. Economic&#13;
races of return are estimated based on these gross conditions linked to assumptions made with local&#13;
engineers on vehicle cost and road condition (Table 3). Net benefit streams are estimated from the&#13;
comparison of with and without project cases.&#13;
23.    Costs considered are the estimated project cost and provisions for operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) based on the type of work. They are assumed to be annually 5% of total project cost for a&#13;
reconstruction, 4 percent for a rehabilitation and 3 percent for a maintenance project. Roads are currently&#13;
financed through fuel taxation. Benefits come from savings in vehicle user cost and time, both due to&#13;
the imnproved road condition. As no precise measurement of road condition is available for each sub-&#13;
project, four road surface conditions have been defined: very poor, poor. fair and good. A project&#13;
classified under reconstruction is assumed to improve the road condition from very poor to good, under&#13;
relhabilitation from poor to good and under maintenance from poor to fair.&#13;
24.    Four kinds of vehicles have been considered, narnely, private cars, taxis, light trucks and heavy&#13;
trucks. Vehicle user costs depend on the road surface condition and the type of vehicle (Table 4). They&#13;
derive from fuel (or diesel) consumption, maintenance cost and tire life, and are first estimated as cost&#13;
per vehicle-km.  User time costs (for private cars and shared taxis) are computed for passengers&#13;
depending on average speed related to road surface condition and the kind of road. The average wage&#13;
rate is assumed to be NIS 50 per day net of all taxation. As the rate of unemployment is rather high,&#13;
the opportunity cost of labor adopted is set at NIS 25 per day. For light and heavy trucks, savings on&#13;
the time spent at the workshop for repair due to road condition has been estimated. These costs are&#13;
valued using the net price to hire a truck for a day, taken as NIS 300 for a light truck and NIS 600 for&#13;
c heavy one.&#13;
25.    The cost and benefit streams include the capital, provisions for O&amp;M  and benefits from the&#13;
savings in vehicle user costs and time cost, due to the change in road surface condition. Benefits are&#13;
estimated for eachi kinid of vehicle and aggregated to be compared with costs. The ADT is required for&#13;
all four kinds of vehicies. When it was only given by cars and trucks, cars are split between private cars&#13;
and taxis depending in the kind of road. Heavy trucks were taken as 35 percent of all trucks. As no&#13;
assumptions could be made on diverted and generated traffic, traffic growth rate was set at 4 percent for&#13;
both with and witliout project cases. These are all conservative assumptions for WBG.&#13;
26.    Sensitivily analysis. The ADT is a major variable of the model as it is the major justification for&#13;
investing. A 10 percent decrease in ADT reduces ERRs by 4 to 6 percent, reducing the number of&#13;
acceptable projects by 1.  Increasing project cost by 10 percent reduces ERRs by 3 to 5 percent,&#13;
eliminiating I project. Under both incidences, two projects are eliminated. The traffic growth rate was&#13;
also tested.  Assuming there is no traffic growth eliminates 6 projects. Taken all three incidences&#13;
together, ERR are reduced by 10 to 12 percent and 14 projects are eliminated, totalling US$10 million.&#13;
Among the projects to be funded under the component, I project is eliminated by sensitivity analyses.&#13;
Almost all projects selected have high rates of return (above 30 percent).!'&#13;
8!     To assess the projecrs with high rates of return, a present value method would be useful. However, the&#13;
approach was developed to select projects passing the criterion of the minimum attractive ERR.&#13;
&#13;

27.    Examples. Rehabilitation and upgrading of village access roads to Arrabeh, Fahmeh and Kufr&#13;
Rai (Jenin district) have an ERR of 105 percent. The project is upgrading 5.8 km for a total cost of&#13;
US$0.6 million. Traffic counts are 1,050 vehicles of light duty and 100 trucks. Upgrading 4.5 km of&#13;
roads in Khan Younis (Gaza strip) for a total cost of US$1.75 million presents an ERR of 42 percent.&#13;
The traffic is 1750 cars and 158 trucks.&#13;
Maintenance Program&#13;
28.    Maintenance activities have major direct benefits for users and the municipality, as well as&#13;
important spill-over benefits. Users are benefiting directly from the maintenance of municipal assets as&#13;
the quality of services is improved and these services are more reliable. The municipality budget is&#13;
improved through direct savings. The Maintenance Program has not yet identified specific assets to be&#13;
maintained, therefore no rate of return could be estimated for this component. However, the Program&#13;
is to be modeled on the one currently functioning in Nazareth and the benefits of this Program were taken&#13;
as an example to illustrate some of the benefits to be expected from the Maintenance Program.&#13;
29.    Water network maintenance. Such maintenance activities improve the provision of water (both&#13;
in quantity and in quality). Pipe break downs in West Bank currently cause shortages of several days.&#13;
When pipes are replaced preventively or at least repaired rapidly, shortages are reduced and the provision&#13;
of water is more reliable, benefiting imrnmediately all users. Moreover, the quality of water is improved&#13;
and it can be better monitored through a program of regular activities on a network. Users benefit&#13;
directly from the maintenance of the network and can notice immnediately its better management.&#13;
Maintaining the network is also of great importance to the municipality itself.  The reduction of&#13;
commercial losses results in additional revenues. From the Nazareth example, it shows that changing&#13;
the meters every five years had helped reducing the losses by 5 percent. Water revenues savings are&#13;
approximately US$26,000 per year, which represents 7 percent of current revenues from water bills.&#13;
Reduction of unaccounted for water will help clarify consumption patterns, which is paramount to&#13;
financial accountability and the planning of future investments. As water resources are scarce in West&#13;
Bank, it is of regional interest to better manage networks to reduce physical losses.&#13;
30.    Road network maintenance. Maintaining the road surface condition has major benefits for the&#13;
user. As it helps preventing the deterioration of the road, vehicle user costs are reduced and the life of&#13;
vehicles increased. It results in direct user savings and the postponing of investments. Time savings anrd&#13;
safety are increased as traffic management is enhanced by a better quality of the road, traffic lights and&#13;
signs. The reduction of potholes and cracks also improves passenger comfort. Moreover, it reduces&#13;
losses of goods during transportation, benefiting local companies (and reducing indirectly transportation&#13;
cots). Besides these significant user benefits, municipality benefits are also important. Examples show&#13;
that maintaining a road lengthens its life-time and postpones additional investnent for the municipality.&#13;
In Nazareth, spending US$35,000 on a kilometer of road 3 and 6 years after the initial investment,&#13;
increases the life of the road by 3 years (frorm 6 to 9). Postponing for three years the reconstructing of&#13;
kilometer of road, at an estimated cost of US$400,000, would save about US$12,000 in present value&#13;
terms, for the municipality. Regular maintenance activities will improve municipality finance. They&#13;
enhance its ability to plan sustainable programs of expansion of the network and to optimize the life of&#13;
physical assets.&#13;

Neighborhood Upgrading Program2'&#13;
31.    The upgrading of the neighborhoods in Gaza municipality will improve the provision of needed&#13;
basic services for lower-income households.   Eighty-four hectares were appraised, benefiting&#13;
approximately 4,500 households. The net cost is estimated at US$9.3 million including physical&#13;
contingencies. Incremental operation and maintenance costs are assumed to be 2 percent of capital&#13;
investment cost. The rate of return is 20 percent.&#13;
32.    The upgrading of these neighborhoods will improve the quality of life of the lower income&#13;
communities. Benefits have been quantified in terms of property value increase. The target communities&#13;
were compared with comparable areas already serviced. Property values are estimated to increase from&#13;
US$10.9 million to US$27.3 million after the investment. It represents an increase of 18 percent in the&#13;
average value of an apartment, currently estimated at US$20,700 and estimated after the upgrading at&#13;
US$24,450. The benefit is taken into account after the completion of the upgrading. The life of the&#13;
investment is assumed to be 20 years. Based on these estimates, the economic rate of return is 20 percent&#13;
(Table 5). Sensitivity analyses indicate that with 10 percent reduction in property values in target and&#13;
comparable areas, the ERR would be reduced to 14 percent; with 10 percent increase in capital&#13;
investment costs, the ERR would be 15 percent; with 10 percent increase in operation and maintenance&#13;
costs, the ERR would be reduced to 19 percent. All these three incidences taken together will lead to&#13;
an ERR of 8 percent.&#13;
33.   It should be noted t,aat the provision of street lighting, sidewalks and street paving repair would&#13;
contribute to increase the safety of these neighborhoods. Sanitary sewage network repairs, storm drainage&#13;
improvements and flooding prevention will also have a positive impact on public health and help prevent&#13;
environmental hazards. These spill-over benefits, however, have not been quantified.&#13;

Validation Mechanism of Econonic Feasibility&#13;
I.     A validation mechanism has been established to ensure the economic feasibility of infrastructure investments&#13;
implemented over the four years of the project and to adjust the analytical approaches developed (Annex 18).&#13;
2.     Situation and objectives. The investment program proposed originally by the municipalities and PECDAR&#13;
totalled US$600 million. Given the limited availability of resources, the strategy adopted was to set a hierarchy of&#13;
filters to derive a refined list (Annex 18, paras. 3-6). The economic feasibility of projects was one of the filters&#13;
and the minimum desirable rate of return was chosen to be 14 percent.'' As a result, infrastructure investments to&#13;
be implemented under the Project will have an economic rate of return of at least 14 percent. Infrastructure&#13;
investments will be funded over the four years of the project. Consequently, all data necessary to assess the&#13;
economic feasibility of investments was not ready at the time of appraisal, particularly for those scheduled for the&#13;
third and fourth years of the Project. A validation mechanism has been established with two objectives: (a) to&#13;
ensure that key data is collected for all projects that have been preliminarily selected to be funded; and (b) to&#13;
confirm their economic feasibility. A secondary objective was to reduce the collection of unnecessary data through&#13;
a pre-selection of projects likely to be funded.&#13;
3.     Validation mechanism. The mechanism ensures that four major steps are followed. These steps are:&#13;
Step 1: Pre-evaluation of projects. Analytical appro3ches have been developed to pre-evaluate the&#13;
projects. Projects are classified into categories associated with standard conditions (Annex 18 for&#13;
discussion). Costs and benefits are assessed based on estimates and the economic rate of return evaluated.&#13;
Step 2: Pre-selection o' p-ojects. Projects passing Step I are checked to ensure that they respond to&#13;
community social priorities and are ccnfirmed by local communities as being f hiigh priority to them. In&#13;
addition, projects have to meet thrme zonditions: (a) consistency with scctoi strategy; (b) posit.ve&#13;
environmental impact and health facto-.' and (c) institutional arrangemients for O&amp;M set up (Annex 18,&#13;
para. 6).&#13;
Step 3: Evaluation of projects. All key data required to confirm the economic evaluation of pre-selected&#13;
projects is collected. The analytical approaches developed are adapted to utilize those project-specific data.&#13;
Pre-selected pro,ects are re-evaluated.&#13;
Step 4: Selection of projects. Projects passing Step 3 are selected for implementation.&#13;
4.     Monitoring mechanisn. A process is set up through the validation mechanism to adjust the analytical&#13;
approaches in light of experience over the four years of project implementation. Data is collected on pre-selected&#13;
projects to refine th.~ economic evaluation, and adjust the standard parameters to those projects (Step 3). All these&#13;
data will be aggregated and used to adjust the estimates used for the pre-evaluation.&#13;
1/     The cost of capital is estimated at 10 percent for WBG. The hurdle was raised to ensure that the highest&#13;
value cohort would be considered for further analyses (Annex 18. para. 4).&#13;

            West Bank and Gaza - Municipal
            Infrastructure Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Municipal Infrastructure Development
            Project seeks to continue the thrusts of the Emergency
            Rehabilitation Project, but will break new ground by helping
            to initiate significant institutional reform and capacity
            building in the local government sector. Specific project
            objectives, therefore, are: 1) to help remove critical
            infrastructural bottlenecks; improve essential services and
            facilities; preserve existing infrastructural assets; and
            create productive employment; and 2) to strengthen the local
            government system, particularly to rationalize roles and
            responsibilities and build finance and managerial capacity.
            The project will consist of the following components: 1)
            infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement including: (a)
            a rehabilitation and improvement sub-program; (b) a
            maintenance sub-program; and (c) a neighborhood upgrading
            sub-program; 2) local government reform and capacity
            building comprising: (a) local government technical
            assistance and capacity building; and (b) selected
            municipality technical assistance and capacity building; and
            3) managerial support and incremental operating expenses.
