A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project is a multi-sector emergency-type investment&#13;
project aiming to address some of the most urgent reconstruction needs of Republika Srpska (RS), one of&#13;
the two Entities that form Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). This Technical Annex complements the Credit&#13;
documentation prepared by the Bank in support of this Project. The sectoral Appendices to the Technical&#13;
Annex provide more detailed information on the four economic sectors covered by the Project.&#13;
2.    The declaration of independence of BH at the end of 1991 was quickly followed by an&#13;
exhausting war that lasted three and a half years. The war completely shattered the economy and left&#13;
extensive human and physical devastation. By 1995, BH's GDP had shrunk by 70 percent from its pre-&#13;
war level, and its per-capita GDP had declined to US$ 600. Separate economic management systems&#13;
within the country developed during the war. RS adopted the FRY Dinar as well as its tax, trade, and&#13;
banking legislation. Within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, separate fiscal and financial&#13;
policies and management were implemented in the majority Bosniak and Croat areas.&#13;
3.    While post-war economic recovery is well underway in the Federation where industrial&#13;
production rose by 60 percent during the first nine months of 1996, recovery in RS is lagging behind and&#13;
began only slowly after the removal of intemational sanctions in March 1996. Following the removal of&#13;
sanctions, trade and the supply of basic commodities have improved to a certain extent. Nevertheless,&#13;
the difficult post-war situation in supply and production, particularly in non-agricultural sectors, remains&#13;
largely unchanged. Current estimates place RS production in late 1996 at 8-10 percent of its pre-war&#13;
level. Because of the very low level of economic activity and tax rate reductions early in the year, 1996&#13;
tax revenues of RS fell below their 1995 level, which forced further expenditure restraint in order to&#13;
maintain the budget balance. Credit and monetary expansion were also limited under FR Yugoslavia's&#13;
tight monetary program.&#13;
4.    War damage and resulting urgent reconstruction needs are large and widespread across all&#13;
economic sectors of both Entities of BH. However, the existence of economic sanctions on RS,&#13;
difficulties of access to and communication with RS, and issues of compliance by RS with the provisions&#13;
of the Paris/ Dayton Peace Agreement have led many donors to target their initial financial support to the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. For 1997, there is increased interest among the donor community&#13;
to establish a better balance for financial support between the two Entities of BH. Support by the Bank&#13;
Group for BH, since mid-1996, has included both Entities, but only 5 percent of Bank lending in 1996&#13;
was allocated to benefit RS; during 1997, Bank lending to BH benefited both Entities in about equal&#13;
shares. Overall, there has been no major effort by the donors to date to finance urgent reconstruction&#13;
needs of RS in the agriculture, housing, water and sanitation, and electric power sectors. Given the&#13;
expectation of increasing refugee returns into RS starting in mid-1997, and in view of possible further&#13;
population movements within RS, active reconstruction in these four economic sectors will be of critical&#13;
importance to allow for the integration of returnees and displaced people into their former or new&#13;
communities. This is the framework within which the proposed Project has been prepared.&#13;
B. SECTOR BACKGROUND&#13;
Agriculture Sector&#13;
5.    Bosnia and Herzegovina is essentially rural, its 540,000 small private farms prior to the war&#13;
accounted for more than half of all households. Primary agricultural production alone comprised 14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 2 of 24&#13;
percent of GSP'. While being a net importer of food, mainly of grains, exports of livestock products,&#13;
vegetables and wine were important. Unlike in other former Yugoslav republics, some 96 percent of the&#13;
agricultural land is in private ownership. Republika Srpska itself is geographically divided into two&#13;
areas: the northem and westem area centered on Banja Luka and bounded to the north by the Sava River;&#13;
and the southern and eastern area bounded in the east by the Drina River. From the confluence of the two&#13;
rivers near Bijeljina in the north, running westwards up the Sava valley towards Prijedor there is an&#13;
extensive area of relatively flat, fertile land. The share of arable land decreases sharply towards the east&#13;
and south of RS, giving way to pastures. CliInate is generally continental, rainfall is mostly adequate.&#13;
6.    War damage to agriculture in RS has deprived private farmers of their means of production,&#13;
shelter, food, employment and income. Damage is heavily localized, such as in the southern part of the&#13;
Banja Luka region, known as the Anvil Area where the population was displaced several times and large&#13;
shares of livestock and farm machinery were lost. Because the rural economy has been effectively&#13;
destroyed in this area, rural families have tended to remain either in refugee status or lodged in local&#13;
towns where they impose an additional burden on already fragile housing conditions. Overall damage&#13;
estimates to agriculture in RS are 30 percent for livestock and 40 percent for farm machinery. Without&#13;
livestock, farm families returning to areas with heavy agricultural losses are denied the opportunity to&#13;
generate cash income, and without farm machinery they can neither grow crops nor provide fodder for&#13;
any livestock they may intend to acquire. Even a return to manual methods is often unlikely because of&#13;
the loss of hand tools.&#13;
7.    In summary, the main constraints towards agricultural recovery are as follows:&#13;
* Lost assets. Total war damage to agriculture in BH is in the multi-billion dollar range. Replacing&#13;
lost livestock and farm machinery, along with provision of seasonal inputs, is a priority.&#13;
* Uncertain land ownership. Temporary user rights to the land may be needed for the displaced and&#13;
refugees until contested ownership rights can be settled.&#13;
* Small and fragmented farms. With an average size of 3 to 5 hectares, the average farm is small and&#13;
largely inappropriate for modem mechanized farming. Consolidation through land markets is&#13;
needed.&#13;
* Poor technical perfonnance. Low crop yields and substandard livestock performance call for&#13;
establishment of agricultural extension and strengthening of veterinary services and research.&#13;
* Lack of credit. Farmers are worst affected by the weakness of BH's banking system. Rural financial&#13;
services, possibly through local NGOs, need to be developed.&#13;
* Lack of markets and farmer organization. Agricultural product markets tailored to the private farm&#13;
sector need to be developed, fanner cooperation through associations should be strengthened.&#13;
8.    Unlike in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, no major reconstruction as taken place in&#13;
the agriculture sector in RS since the end of the hostilities. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the&#13;
UN (kAO) and NGOs have provided urgent fann inputs such as seed, fertilizer and pesticides, also hand&#13;
tools, however in relatively small quantities. Bilateral aid has contributed some animals and agricultural&#13;
inputs.&#13;
Housing Sector&#13;
9.    Of the RS pre-war population of 1.3 million, only 20 percent lived in urban areas, most of them&#13;
in Banja Luka which was the second largest city in BH. The population was well housed with private&#13;
housing representing 80 percent of the stock. Urban areas had a mix of both public and private housing.&#13;
Within the former Yugoslavia, the measure of national income was Gross Social Product (GSP), a&#13;
measure which excludes services, except those involved in the transport and distribution of goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 3 of 24&#13;
Public housing in the form of multi-family medium and high-rise brick or prefabricated panel housing&#13;
was concentrated in the largest towns of RS (Banja Luka, Brcko, Doboj, Prijedor) where it accounted for&#13;
30 to 50 percent of the housing stock. Public housing was funded through a salary tax. Public apartment&#13;
houses were built by large public construction firms on behalf of socially-owned enterprises as well as&#13;
social and public institutions which then allocated units for rental to their employees. Tenure in public&#13;
housing units bestowed many of the benefits of full ownership, including inheritance rights.&#13;
10.   Housing conditions in RS have deteriorated greatly due to war damage and massive displacement of&#13;
the population. An estimated 24 percent of the housing in RS has been damaged and about five percent&#13;
destroyed.2 The value of the damage to the housing stock is estimated at around US$ I billion. About 27 of&#13;
the 45 RS municipalities have experienced some form of damage to their housing stock. Accommodation in&#13;
cities largely untouched by the war is in short supply due to the influx of displaced persons. Some 10,000&#13;
people in RS remain in crowded collective centers. Most of the larger RS municipalities have established&#13;
procedures for allocating vacated units to displaced families or placing them with host families, giving&#13;
preference to finding accommodation for people in collective centers. War damnage to housing has been&#13;
exacerbated by collateral damage caused by weather conditions, lack of maintenance and the deterioration of&#13;
inflrstructure installations and connections to networks. Some vacated houses have been deliberately burned&#13;
and others have been subject to looting.&#13;
11.   These are the key issues to be addressed for a recovery ofthe housing sector:&#13;
&#149; Conflicting ownership and tenant rights. Recent laws are considered to be contrary to the provisions&#13;
of Annex 7 of the Paris/ Dayton Peace Agreement and to interfere with the right of owners and&#13;
occupants to reclaim their units. The RS authorities recognize the need to change this legislation.&#13;
The conflicting claims and legislation will take time to resolve. In the interim, procedures need to be&#13;
set up to review the status of ownership and occupancy of houses targeted for repair.&#13;
-  Limited funding available. Donor-financed investments should be extended as loans to beneficiaries,&#13;
rather than grants, to allow for cost recovery and the use of reflows for future repair investments.&#13;
-  High level of damage requires selectivity of investments. Repairs should target low to medium&#13;
damage first and focus on creating incremental living space.&#13;
&#149;  Transition from supply to demand-driven sector policy. Private sector investment into housing needs&#13;
to be supported through clear and enforceable property rights; privatization of housing stock; rental&#13;
charges that ensure cost recovery; development of housing finance; privatization of the construction&#13;
industry; and streamlining of regulations relating to land use and housing development.&#13;
12.    Efforts at reconstruction of housing in RS during 1996 have been fairly limited. UNHCR has&#13;
distributed materials for the repair of about 2,700 units in the Pale and Banja Luka regions. UNHCR's&#13;
Target Area Initiative, which is intended to facilitate the return and reintegration of refugees and&#13;
displaced persons, covers a few municipalities in RS for a total of about 9,000 housing units in the&#13;
Sipovo, Ribnik and Bratunac municipalities. Selected NGOs supported by bilateral donors have assisted&#13;
with repair of private houses. Some municipalities have undertaken repairs of roofs in lightly damaged&#13;
public housing to accommodate displaced households and preserve this stock. Surveys of housing&#13;
damage in RS have been completed by IMG. A survey by the RS Ministry of Urbanism, Housing and&#13;
Construction indicates a need for urgent public housing investments of US$ 70 million in 27&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
Water and Sanitation Sector&#13;
13.   Water supply services in BH used to be of satisfactory coverage and quality. About 70 percent of&#13;
the urban population was served, 24-hour service was the norn. Some 35 percent of the rural population&#13;
2    Damage estimates for the Federation are 50 percent of the stock, with an additional six percent destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Terhnical Annex&#13;

were connected to piped water supply systems, the remaining population had on-site water supply&#13;
facilities such as springs or wells. In the area of RS, prior to the war, there were some 50 urban water&#13;
supply systems covering 56 percent of the pre-war population, and about 9,800 village water supply&#13;
systems providing service to 44 percent of the population. Regarding sewerage services, about 60&#13;
percent of the urban population and about 10 percent of the rural population were covered in RS. Most&#13;
of the remaining population had on-site sewage treatment and disposal facilities. Large industries had&#13;
their own water supply and waste water disposal systems. Operation and maintenance of water and&#13;
sanitation services was not cost-covering, requiring financial support from public budgets. RS has at its&#13;
disposal adequate water resources and sufficient precipitation.&#13;
14.   The war has seriously disrupted water supply and sanitation services in RS, full-time supply&#13;
service is no longer the normn. Due to lack of proper water treatment, water quality may not comply with&#13;
drinking water standards. Sewers are blocked, treatment plants are out of order, landfill sites fail to&#13;
protect water courses, river pollution is on the rise. Physical damage is concentrated along former&#13;
confrontation lines affecting facilities located primarily above the ground level such as water pumping&#13;
stations, treatment plants, reservoirs, and river dikes. War impact also relates to the loss of service&#13;
vehicles, lack of mechanical and electrical equipment, loss of staff, and unfinished construction works.&#13;
The most severe impact is felt from system malfunctions due to lack of maintenance and replacement&#13;
investments during and after the war period. Contamination caused by land mines is a firther issue.&#13;
Overloading of water supply and sanitation services due to heavy population shifts, and disruption of&#13;
water services in areas where water source and water supply areas have been separated by the Inter-Entity&#13;
Boundary Line add to the post-war problems.&#13;
15.   The water and sanitation sector faces numerous challenges in order to recover from the war:&#13;
* High unaccounted-for water losses. Losses vary between 40 and 60 percent. Developing new&#13;
resources and systems may be more econbmic than investments to reduce water losses.&#13;
- Poor sewage systems. Systems are designed for combined collection of sewage and storm water and&#13;
discharge raw sewage into rivers. Separate systems and new sewage treatment plants will be needed.&#13;
- Rise in water-borne diseases. Reducing health risks is a priority, requiring repairs to leaking and&#13;
blocked sewers, inoperative water and sewage treatment plants, pumping stations and septic tanks.&#13;
* Poor cost recovery. Municipalities need to increase charges and collections to be able to operate and&#13;
maintain water systems. Financial support from the public budget will no longer be available.&#13;
* Need for public divestiture. The water construction and consulting industry needs to transfer from&#13;
public to private status and ownership. Remaining public sector institutions require strengthening. -&#13;
16.   Reconstruction in the water and sanitation sector in RS since the end of the hostilities has been&#13;
limited to initial assistance by the European Union, the United Kingdom, the Red Cross, Norway, and&#13;
some NGOs for the supply of the most urgently needed materials, works, equipment and spare parts. The&#13;
combined value of this assistance, during 1996, is estimated at US$ 5 million. Consultants supervised by&#13;
the International Management Group have prepared a comprehensive Emergency Reconstruction and&#13;
Development Plan for the water sector of RS, based on which major reconstruction can be initiated.&#13;
Electric Power Sector&#13;
17.   Prior to the hostilities, a single enterprise, Elektroprivreda Bosnia i Herzegovina, was&#13;
responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution. In 1992, this single enterprise was&#13;
broken up into public utilities serving the areas under majority Bosniak, Croat, and Serb control,&#13;
respectively. Since June 1992, the electric power sector in RS is operated by Elektroprivreda Republika&#13;
Srpska (EPRS). In 1995, electricity generation in the territory of RS was 2,355 GWh (or 56 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page S of 24&#13;
the total generation in Bosnia and Herzegovina), and electricity consumption was 2,264 GWh.3&#13;
Electricity exchange with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1995 amounted to imports of about 400&#13;
GWh and exports of some 327 GWh. Most of the plants have suffered throughout the war from the lack&#13;
of maintenance on installed equipment.&#13;
18.   The electric transmission system in RS includes two parts: western RS around Banja Luka, and&#13;
eastern RS south of the Posavina corridor, interconnected by 110 kV lines. The transmission network&#13;
and control system were largely damaged, particularly in those areas located close to the former&#13;
confrontation lines. Total capacity of the transmission substations is about 4,220 MVA. The RS&#13;
distribution network includes Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Pale and Trebinje. Networks include 67,884&#13;
km of overhead lines, 9,114 km of cables, and 3,129 MVA transformer stations capacity. Many of the&#13;
distribution networks have been significantly destroyed as a result of localized fighting and lack of&#13;
maintenance.  Transformer stations, civil works structures, telecommunications and maintenance&#13;
equipments are also darnaged or destroyed.&#13;
19.   Principal problems and areas in need of support in the electric power sector include the&#13;
following:&#13;
&#149; Distribution system overload. Damnaged systems are unable to cope with rising consumption due to&#13;
usage of electricity for space heating. Distribution system repairs are urgently needed.&#13;
* Poor cost recovery. Billings and collections are inadequate to cover current system operating and&#13;
maintenance costs. The power entities will need the firm support by the RS Government to enforce&#13;
collections and raise revenues to required minimum sustainable levels.&#13;
e  Entity linkage. Power generation sources are concentrated in the eastem part of RS, while the major&#13;
load center is located in the western part. Existing transmission linkage between eastern and western&#13;
RS is weak. Improved cooperation between RS and the Federation to exchange power is critical.&#13;
* Weak institutions. The breakup of the former single electric utility company has yet to result in a&#13;
distribution of liabilities between the successor enterprises. The existing situation of largely separate&#13;
power systems constitutes an obstacle to safe, efficient and economic operations.&#13;
20.   Since 1996, a number of donor-financed repairs, of limited value and scope, have been initiated&#13;
in RS. Rehabilitation of the Ugljevik thermal plant and associated coal mine has been started.&#13;
Reconstruction of a 400 kV transmission line between Ugljevik and Banja Luka has begun. A section of&#13;
the 220 kV transmission line running through Central Bosnia from Trebinje to Bihac has been completed.&#13;
Completion of these lines, particularly the 220 kV line, will restore the linkage between the RS and the&#13;
Federation power grids. Repair of a 110 kV line between the cities of Visegrad, Gorazde and Foca was&#13;
completed in 1996 and will improve power ability in Gorazde. Rehabilitation of a part of the distribution&#13;
networks in Doboj, Bijeljina, Srebrenica, Gorazde, Foca and Mrkonjic Grad has been started.&#13;
Nevertheless, availability of electric power is still limited, especially in western RS where economic&#13;
recovery is constrained by insufficient power supply.&#13;
C. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
21.   On April 1, 1996, Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfilled the conditions of succession to the former&#13;
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC. Membership is&#13;
retroactive to February 25, 1993. The resolution of Bosnia's arrears with the World Bank, through&#13;
3    This compares with a pre-war generation, in 1990, for all of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 13,090 GWh and&#13;
an electricity consumption of 11,181 GWh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 6 of 24&#13;
consolidation of its IBRD debt, allowed regular Bank lending to begin in June 1996. With a war-&#13;
devastated economy, low post-war per capita GDP and lack of creditworthiness, Bosnia was declared&#13;
IDA eligible.4&#13;
22.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing, with the BH&#13;
authorities, a blueprint for reconstruction of the country's economy. A three- to four-year Priority&#13;
Reconstruction Program totaling some US$ 5.1 billion was presented to and endorsed by a donors'&#13;
conference co-sponsored by the Bank and the European Union, following signing of the Dayton-Paris&#13;
Peace Accords in December 1995. This conference, and a second in April 1996, led to 1996&#13;
commitments of about US$ 1.8 billion from some sixty bilateral and multilateral donors for immediate&#13;
and priority reconstruction activities. A third donors' conference held in July 1997 secured additional&#13;
donor commitments of US$ 1.2 billion for 1997.&#13;
23.   Of the total estimated value for this Program of US$ 5.1 billion over a three to four year period,&#13;
urgent needs assessments for RS resulted in an estimated financing requirement of some US$ 1.4 billion&#13;
for reconstruction investments within RS. The existence of economic sanctions on RS in early 1996,&#13;
difficulties of access to and communication with RS, and issues of compliance by RS with the provisions&#13;
of the Paris/ Dayton Peace Agreement have led many donors to focus their initial financial support on the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result, only about 2 percent of the 1996 financial pledges of&#13;
donors were directed at reconstruction in RS. In 1997, there has been increased interest among the donor&#13;
community to establish a better balance for financial support between the two Entities of BH.&#13;
24.   During 1996, the Bank followed an assistance strategy aimed at jump-starting economic activity&#13;
through support of a broad range of economic sectors. Leveraging Bank resources with significant&#13;
funding from donors was an important element of this strategy. Before arrears resolution, IDA supported&#13;
a series of immediate assistance programs through a special US$ 150 million Trust Fund for Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina (TFBH). Seven emergency operations were approved under the TFBH, included rebuilding&#13;
of government institutions and funding of a line of credit to small business, as well as support for&#13;
rehabilitation in the agriculture, water and sanitation, transport, health, education and heating sectors.&#13;
25.   Since the start of regular IDA lending in mid-1996, US$ 257.6 million in IDA resources have&#13;
been committed, supporting two of the operations under the TFBH and an additional 11 operations&#13;
focused on clearing of landmines, reconstruction of electric power, transport infrastructure, housing,&#13;
hospitals and schools, establishment of a guarantee facility for industry, and three programs to support&#13;
recovery of employment through public works, re-training and loans to microbusinesses. IDA's&#13;
assistance program also supported the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional&#13;
reforms: a Transition Assistance Credit, approved by the Board in September 1996, was the first&#13;
operation focusing on institution-building in the Federation and a series of structural reforms needed for&#13;
advancing the transition to a market-economy; and under the second transport project, approved by the&#13;
Board in August 1997, an adjustment component supports similar key structural reforms in the RS. The&#13;
IFC has also committed US$ 2 million to an equity fund and US$ 0.7 million for a microbusiness&#13;
project.&#13;
26.   While emphasis during the first post-war year was on moving quickly with emergency&#13;
reconstruction across a range of sectors, IDA's country assistance strategy for FY 98 and 99 shifts the&#13;
focus on sustainability and ensuring the medium- to long- term viability of policies and investments.&#13;
Significant donor resources are needed for the next several years; however, BH must increasingly become&#13;
more self-reliant in preparation for the time when these inflows are no longer available. This will mean&#13;
4    Membership, arrears resolution and a limited country assistance strategy are outlined in the Memorandum&#13;
of the President titled "World Bank Membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Proposed Financial&#13;
Assistance," dated March 4, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

viable government institutions, sustainable government budgets, improved cost-recovery policies and&#13;
mechanisms and structural reforms that stimulate private investment. Three overarching objectives will&#13;
guide Bank Group strategy: (i) further development of the basic institutional infrastructure for economic&#13;
management; (ii) transition to a market economy through deepening of major structural reforms; and (iii)&#13;
continued, selective support of physical reconstruction.&#13;
27.   Further policy-enhancing investment or adjustment operations are envisaged to support&#13;
institution-building at the State and Entity level, as well as key reforms in the areas of public finance and&#13;
enterprise and bank privatization. In the area of reconstruction, future IDA operations will support key&#13;
areas such as the network infrastructure sectors of gas and transport, as well as agriculture, the social&#13;
sector and other sectors essential to economic recovery. Limited IDA resources will continue to make&#13;
partnerships with other donors essential: Mobilizing co-funding for future operations, and coordinating&#13;
strategies -- e.g., eventual exit from those sectors where other donors are more fully engaged or have&#13;
greater comparative advantage -- will be important elements of this partnership.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
28.   The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS), discussed in August 19, 1997. The Project is the first operation dedicated entirely to&#13;
support reconstruction in RS. Since 1996, the Board of IDA approved ten projects providing financial&#13;
support to both Entities in BH. However, none of them covered basic reconstruction needs in the RS&#13;
regarding municipal infrastructure (housing, water and sanitation, electric power) and support for rural&#13;
communities (agriculture), while all of these areas have been addressed within the Federation of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina through Bank-supported emergency projects since 1996. The proposed Reconstruction&#13;
Assistance Project would assist RS to carry out urgent repairs and investments in these areas.&#13;
29.   Through its involvement, since 1996, the Bank has been able to mobilize substantial additional&#13;
donor support for projects in the Federation in the four sectors of agriculture, housing, water and&#13;
sanitation, and electric power. The Bank's presence and oversight over project implementation has&#13;
provided reassurance to donors and led to important financial cofinancing commitments. A similar&#13;
impact is expected through the Bank's support for the proposed Project in RS. Without the Bank's&#13;
involvement, it likely that less donor resources could be mobilized quickly for investments in RS within&#13;
the four sectors concerned.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/lDA Experience&#13;
30.   A multitude of important lessons has been learned from Bank-supported emergency projects in&#13;
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996, covering agriculture, housing, water and&#13;
sanitation, and electric energy. Further experience has been gained from a variety of pre-war projects in&#13;
these sectors in which the Bank was involved. These lessons are set out in detail in the attached four&#13;
sectoral Appendices. At a cross-sectoral level, the Bank has learned important lessons as to the&#13;
institutional framework necessary to allow timely and sustainable reconstruction investments to take&#13;
place in BH. The Country Portfolio Performance Reviews of 1996 and 1997 highlight these lessons as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Project organization and management. The number of separate project implementation units should&#13;
be limited, existing government structures should be reinforced. Project implementation staff should&#13;
have regularized employment status, be employed based on contracts and agreed salaries, and should&#13;
work following detailed job descriptions.&#13;
*  Project accounts and audits. A uniform system of accounts should be used for all projects. Projects&#13;
should provide for the cost of end-year extemal financial audits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 8 of 24&#13;
*  Procurement management. An agency to monitor and audit procurement implementation is required,&#13;
both to support and to supervise project units on their adherence with agreed procurement guidelines.&#13;
*  Projects financial sustainability. To ensure that reconstruction investments are sustained, workable&#13;
budget systems have to be set up and adequate cost recovery policies are to be implemented.&#13;
*  Coordination with donors. Donors need to be invited to actively involve the project implementation&#13;
units of the government in planning and implementation of donor-financed reconstruction projects.&#13;
* Allocation of project resources. Given the vast assistance needs of BH, least-cost solutions are to be&#13;
followed and economic sustainability must be ensured for infrastructure and social sector projects.&#13;
Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
31.   The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project would complement a number of other Bank-&#13;
supported projects that are either already in implementation in RS or are planned for Board consideration.&#13;
These linkages have been described in detail in the attached sectoral Appendices. Complementarity also&#13;
exists between the four investment Components of the Project itself by generating employment and&#13;
income opportunities for retuming refugees and displaced persons, one of the central themes of donor&#13;
support for BH for 1997 and the following years. Since the proposed Project will be implemented&#13;
through a single Project Coordination Unit with four sectoral departments, it will be possible to target&#13;
selected RS municipalities where two or more Components of the Project would provide benefits to the&#13;
same population, thus following an integrated area approach to economic reconstruction.&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
32.   The proposed Project has four primary objectives:&#13;
*  to assist economically-disadvantaged and war-affected farmers restart and strengthen their farming&#13;
activities&#13;
e  to increase the quality and quantity of the public housing stock&#13;
*  to restore water, sanitation and solid waste services to a level that will satisfy basic human needs,&#13;
mitigate public health risks and support the return of economic activity&#13;
*  to improve reliability, availability and quality of electricity supply&#13;
33.   Secondary objectives of the Project are as follows:&#13;
*  to raise agricultural and food production, help reduce the need for imported donor food aid, and&#13;
improve food security&#13;
*  to initiate sustainable sector recovery by introducing cost recovery for infrastructure investments in&#13;
housing, water and sanitation, electric power&#13;
*  to help build up the institutional capacity required for developing and implementing housing, water&#13;
and sanitation, and electric power system repair programs&#13;
*  to support the local economy, promote private construction enterprises, and create employment and&#13;
income through labor-intensive repair works&#13;
*  to assist the RS authorities to develop a medium-term strategy for investments in the water sector&#13;
Project Components&#13;
34.   To support the above objectives, the Project will have the five Components, as follows: (i)&#13;
agriculture; (ii) housing; (iii) water and sanitation; (iv) electric power; and (v) implementation support,&#13;
including establishment of the Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit in RS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;

35.   Given the Brcko Arbitral Award, delivered on February 14, 1997 in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of the Dayton/Paris Accords, the Legal Documents for the proposed Project would distinguish&#13;
investments within the Brcko arbitration area as a separate Brcko Component. This would allow for the&#13;
required flexibility should a final decision by the Brcko Supervisor alter the current allocation of&#13;
responsibilities of the two Entities or create a separate Brcko district. The Project investments within this&#13;
Brcko Component that are IDA-financed would cover housing repairs (civil works US$ 1.3 million) and&#13;
water system repairs (civil works US$ 0.6 million, consultant services US$ 36,000). These investments&#13;
are included in the descriptions for the sectoral Components that follows.&#13;
Component 1: Agriculture (USS 10.2 million)&#13;
36.   The Agriculture Component has three elements: (i) livestock development; (ii) farm&#13;
mechanization; and (iii) farm surveys and technical support (see Appendix I for a detailed description).&#13;
The following three RS municipalities have been identified as target areas for the Agriculture&#13;
Component: Mrkonjic Grad, Ribnik and Sipovo.&#13;
37.   Livestock Development To assist in the initial rebuilding of the RS herds for milk and meat&#13;
production, the Project would finance the purchase of breeding cattle, to be kept by private individual&#13;
small-scale farmers. Livestock would be distributed to farmers on the basis of in-kind supply and credit&#13;
arrangements. A total of about 3,000 pregnant heifers would be imported for distribution to farmers who&#13;
have lost cattle and have the necessary experience and capability of caring for them. The Project will&#13;
also finance the cost of mandatory quarantine in livestock stations, the cost of local transport from the&#13;
quarantine areas to benefiting municipalities, and the cost of one-year contracts with local veterinary&#13;
stations to monitor the health and productivity of imported heifers.&#13;
38.   Farm Mechanization.  Lack of farm power is one of the major constraints to increase&#13;
agricultural production in the war-tom areas of RS. As a result, large areas of arable land are not&#13;
cultivated at present. The Project would provide an initial emergency supply of critically needed farm&#13;
mechanization equipment, including 400 single-axle motor-cultivators in the 7-9 kW engine range, and&#13;
150 small- to medium-size two-axle tractors in the engine range of 25-35 kW. Tractors would be&#13;
provided in packages including all required implements, basic spare parts, and a trailer. The Project will&#13;
also finance the reception, assembly, initial servicing, handling, and local transport of tractors to the&#13;
recipient farmers.&#13;
39.   Farm Surve vs and Technical Support. The Project would finance detailed farm surveys as a&#13;
basis for confirming specific farner interest and identifying eligible farmers. The Project will also&#13;
finance essential technical support from expatriate advisors, and the establishment and running for 12&#13;
months of a Component monitoring and impact evaluation system.&#13;
Component 2: Housing (US$ 15.2 million)&#13;
40.   The Housing Component has two elements: (i) emergency public housing repairs; and (ii)&#13;
technical support (see Appendix 2 for details). The following five RS municipalities have been identified&#13;
for inclusion under the Housing Component: Derventa, Brcko, Modrica, Mrkonjic Grad, and Sipovo.&#13;
41.   Emergency Public Housing Repairs. The Project would finance the repair of damage to&#13;
common elements in multi-story non-system built socially-owned apartment buildings, along with the&#13;
cost of designs, management and supervision by local consultants. About 36,000 publicly owned units&#13;
are estimated to be damaged in urban areas throughout RS. The Housing Component is designed to&#13;
repair approximately 250 buildings containing some 4,500 residential units. This represents some 12.5&#13;
percent of all damnaged social apartnent units in RS. The selection of municipalities has been carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 10 of 24&#13;
primarily based on the extent of physical war damage and the expected demand by the present population&#13;
and potential returnees for reconstructed housing facilities. Individual apartment buildings to be repaired&#13;
would be selected so as to maximize the number of units that could be made habitable in each&#13;
municipality. Proof of public ownership of buildings, the absence of disputed property claims, and&#13;
fulfillment of a number of established damage criteria will be required.&#13;
42.   The repair works would restore common building elements and utilities. These works would&#13;
weather-proof the building envelope so as to prevent further deterioration and to facilitate repairs of the&#13;
interior of apartment units by tenants or through complementary donor-funded programs. Typical works&#13;
financed under this component element would include repair of damage to roofs, external walls,&#13;
windows, entrances, staircases, halls, corridors, and building utility systems, and are described in more&#13;
detail in Appendix 2. Works would be undertaken by contractors selected through competitive bidding.&#13;
43.   Technical Support. The Project would also finance technical support from an expatriate housing&#13;
advisor and local consultants to carry out on-site quality control inspections. The cost of developing&#13;
detailed designs and bidding documents is included in the cost of civil works.&#13;
Component 3: Water and Sanitation (US$ 22.1 million)&#13;
44.   The Water and Sanitation Component has four elements: (i) urgent works; (ii) refuse collection&#13;
equipment; (iii) technical support; and (iv) institutional strengthening. A total 20 RS municipalities have&#13;
been identified for inclusion under this Component, as set out in Appendix 3.&#13;
45.    Urgent Works. The Project would finance urgent rehabilitation works, including required&#13;
material and equipment, to restore water supply and sewage services in 18 selected RS municipalities.&#13;
Works will include rehabilitation and repair of water sources, supply pipelines, water treatment plants,&#13;
distribution networks, the cleaning and repair of sewers, and rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations.&#13;
46.   Refuse Collection Equipment. The Project would finance the purchase of 21 refuse trucks and&#13;
315 refuse collection containers, together with critical spare parts.  Equipment and materials would&#13;
benefit 20 RS municipalities.&#13;
47.   Technical Support. The Project would also finance technical assistance and consultant services&#13;
for preparation of detailed designs and tender documents, for on-site supervision of rehabilitation works,&#13;
and for the development of urgent studies to prepare future investments in the water sector. An expatriate&#13;
advisor would also be financed.&#13;
48.   Institutional Strengthening. The Project would support the Institute for Water Management of&#13;
RS, Zavod za Vodopnvreda, RS (ZVRS) so as to strengthen its administrative and engineering capacity&#13;
to manage and monitor project implementation. The Project would finance office equipment and&#13;
supplies, vehicles and a share of the incremental operating costs and consultants of ZVRS.&#13;
Component 4: Electric Power (USS 15.9 million)&#13;
49.   The Electric Power Component has six elements: (i) 110 kV transmission rehabilitation; (ii) 35&#13;
kV distribution rehabilitation; (iii) Banja Luka distribution repairs; (iv) telecommunication repairs; (v)&#13;
testing equipment and maintenance tools; and (vi) engineering and management (see Appendix 4 for a&#13;
detailed description). Banja Luka is the target area of this Component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page I1 of 24&#13;
50.   110 kV Transmission Rehabilitation.  This Project would finance rehabilitation of four&#13;
substations with a total capacity of 200 MVA, and repairs to six transmission lines with a total length of&#13;
about 1 13 km. Costs include imported equipment and civil works for installation.&#13;
51.   35 kV Distribution Rehabilitation.  The Project would finance the rehabilitation of three&#13;
substations with a total capacity of 20 MVA. Costs include imported equipment and civil works for&#13;
installation.&#13;
52.   Banja Luka Distribution Repairs. The MV and LV distribution networks around Banja Luka&#13;
are extremely deteriorated due to war-related damage, aging and high overloads. The Project will cover&#13;
the rehabilitation of the distribution network in the municipal area of Banja Luka from the 20/10 kV&#13;
secondary substations and step-down transformer substations to LV distribution networks. This will&#13;
include supply and installation of 4,000 household meters for consumers without meters in the Banja&#13;
Luka urban area.&#13;
53.   Telecommunication Repairs. Prior to the war, the telecommunication system for the Banja&#13;
Luka - Prijedor - Mrkonjic Grad distribution network provided voice communication, data acquisition,&#13;
and tele-control functions for the network. During the war, this telecommunication system was heavily&#13;
damaged in the Banja Luka area. To retain control of the distribution network and to operate it&#13;
efficiently, repair of this telecommunication system is an urgent necessity. This Project would finance a&#13;
tam-key package for repairing telecommunication towers and replacing equipment, along with HF&#13;
devices and a telephone exchanger.&#13;
54.   Testing Equipment and Maintenance Tools. Testing equipment and maintenance tools for&#13;
transmission and distribution facilities are worn out and in very short supply. The Project will cover a&#13;
minimum amount of testing equipment and maintenance tools for the Banja Luka service area.&#13;
55.   Engineering and Management   The Project will finance required engineering services to&#13;
prepare detailed designs and tender documents and to manage and supervise all Component-related tasks.&#13;
These services will be delivered and financed by Elektroprivreda RS through Elektroprenos and&#13;
Elektrokrajina. To support engineering and Component management within Elektroprenos and&#13;
Elektrokrajina, the Project will finance the supply of basic office equipment and supplies.&#13;
Component 5: Implementation Support (US$ 1.5 million)&#13;
56.   The Implementation Support Component has two elements: (i) establishment of the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit; and (ii) establishment of the RS Office of the Procurement Monitoring and Audit&#13;
Unit (see Appendix 5 for a detailed description).&#13;
57.   Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU will have overall responsibility for implementing&#13;
the Project.  It will have direct implementation responsibility for the Agriculture and Housing&#13;
Components, and supervise ZVRS and Elektroprivreda RS in implementing the Water and Sanitation and&#13;
Electric Power Components, respectively. The PCU will carry out all procurement, disbursements,&#13;
accounting and reporting ftmctions under the Project. The PCU will be established under the RS&#13;
Ministry of Finance in Banja Luka. The Project will finance the local staff of and expatriate advisors to&#13;
the PCU, necessary office equipment and supplies, vehicles, and incremental operating costs.&#13;
58.   Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit (PMA LU. At the level of the Federation of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, in November 1996, a PMAU was established to monitor and audit the procurement carried&#13;
out by governmental implementing agencies, relating to reconstruction projects that are funded by the&#13;
Bank or financed by funds that are administered by the Bank for other donors. Under the proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Paye 12 of 24&#13;
Project, the existing PMAU mechanism would be extended into Republika Srpska. For this purpose the&#13;
RS Government will enter into an agreement with a qualified foreign consultant firm to assist the RS&#13;
authorities to set up and maintain the RS Office of the PMAU over a two-year period, under terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. The Project will finance local PMAU staff and a full-time expatriate&#13;
advisor, office equipment and incremental operating costs. The Project would also cover the cost of the&#13;
first year-end financial audit of the overall Project by expatriate auditors, under terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
59.   Project Costs. The total estimated costs of the Project are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Physical&#13;
contingencies of three percent on goods and seven percent on works are included. No price contingencies&#13;
have been applied given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. The Project&#13;
will have a two-year implementation period and Project financing is expected to be disbursed over 30&#13;
months. Cost estimates are net of taxes and duties, donor-financed items under the international&#13;
reconstruction program are tax-exempt in RS. Detailed cost estimates for each of the five Components&#13;
are provided in the attached Appendices.&#13;

60.   Financing Plan.  Of the total Project cost, IDA would finance US$ 17 million.  Firm&#13;
commitments for cofinancing and parallel financing have been provided by the European Union (using&#13;
EU's implementing procedures), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Austria,&#13;
Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Further donor cofinancing is being sought actively. Given the&#13;
modular nature of all investments to be financed, delays in securing further donor financing would have&#13;
no impact on the timely start-up and implementation of the five Components. Financing for all essential&#13;
technical support services has been secured. The summary Project financing plan is shown in Table 3.&#13;
Detailed financing plans by sectoral Component are provided in the attchments. No retroactive&#13;
financing has been considered given the lack of financial resources available to the RS authorities for pre-&#13;
financing of Project activities.&#13;

Note: Parallel financing from Norway is expected to support investments in the water and sanitation and the&#13;
electric power components. The exact allocation of this financing has not yet been determined.&#13;
61.   Project Preparation Facility.  The emergency-type reconstruction project was originally&#13;
intended to provide some first visible results on the ground in RS well before the arrival of the 1997/98&#13;
winter. In order to allow project preparation to be completed and to start at least some limited urgent&#13;
housing and water repair works in priority refugee-return areas before the start of the 1997/98 winter&#13;
season, an advance of US$ 2.0 million has been requested by the Borrower and agreed by IDA, against&#13;
the proposed IDA US$ 17.0 million Credit.&#13;
Economic Justification&#13;
62.   The primary objective of this emergency-type Project is to address selected, most urgent&#13;
reconstruction needs of RS in the agriculture, housing, water and sanitation, and electric power sectors.&#13;
For all goods and works to be financed, a least-cost approach has been followed. Livestock and farm&#13;
machinery financed under the Project would yield economic and financial rates of return in excess of 12&#13;
percent since these items would enable farmers to re-start agricultural production on otherwise fallow&#13;
land. Food produced by a farm household would replace purchased food items, excess production would&#13;
be sold or bartered locally. The value of two calves bom by an imported heifer during the first years&#13;
would be sufficient to cover the cost of the investment; the sale of dairy products would add further cash&#13;
income. Farm tractors imported would generate an incremental estimated production of 15,000 tons of&#13;
grains and some 3,000 tons of potatoes, in addition to fodder production used as livestock feed. Further&#13;
income and benefits would result from plowing and transport services for fellow farners without&#13;
mechanized farm power.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 14 of 24&#13;
63.   The Project would replace critical elements of damaged municipal infrastructure so as to improve&#13;
living conditions and satisfy basic human needs of shelter, water and electricity in war-affected areas of&#13;
RS. Economic rates of return would be very high on such investments since they would address key&#13;
bottlenecks that prevent the existing housing, water and electric infrastructure from operating nonnally.&#13;
For housing and water investments, rehabilitation works carried out now will help save future&#13;
replacement investments which, in the absence of the Project, would otherwise have to be carried out&#13;
eventually at a high cost so as to replace entire public apartment buildings and water systems. The&#13;
Project would create an estimated 4,200 pernanent jobs in agriculture and some 40,000 person-months of&#13;
temporary employment resulting from repair works under the Housing, Water and Sanitation, and&#13;
Electric Power Components. See the four sectoral Appendices for more detailed information.&#13;
Environmental Impact&#13;
64.   As an emergency-type operation, the Project has been placed in environmental category B. All&#13;
goods and works procured which present an opportunity for environmental enhancement will be specified&#13;
accordingly. Item usage and works will be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no&#13;
degradation to the environment. The Housing Component would have a positive environmental impact&#13;
as a result of rehabilitating damaged units where municipal infrastructure facilities are likely to exist or&#13;
are in the process of being repaired, and where otherwise buildings would stand empty to deteriorate&#13;
through weathering or vandalism. The Water and Sanitation Component would also have a positive&#13;
environmental impact as a result of reduced water losses, a safer water supply, improved sewage&#13;
collection, and proper disposal of solid waste.&#13;
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
65.   The Project would be implemented over 30 months. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the&#13;
RS Ministry of Finance in Banja Luka has overall responsibility for implementing the Project. The PCU&#13;
is headed by a PCU Director who reports to the RS Minister of Finance. The PCU Director is appointed&#13;
by the RS Government. The PCU Director appoints other local PCU staff. The PCU is composed of a&#13;
Central Support Section as well as four sectoral departments. The Central Support Section will: procure&#13;
all office equipment, fumiture and vehicles; supervise and support procurement and contracting carried&#13;
out by the four sectoral Departments; carry out all financial transactions and maintain the project&#13;
accounts and records; carry out project reporting requirements; and liaise with donors.&#13;
66.   The four sectoral Departments have implementation responsibilities for each respective sectoral&#13;
Component, as set out below. Given the still limited administrative capacities of the RS Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources, and of the RS Ministry of Urbanism, Housing and&#13;
Construction, strong sectoral Departnents will be needed in these sectors, supported by expatriate&#13;
technical assistance. More project implementation capacity is available in the water and sanitation sector&#13;
(ZVRS) and the electric power sector (EPRS), making it possible to limit the role of the PCU to that of&#13;
approval and supervision of project activities carried out outside of the PCU. The structure and staffing&#13;
of the PCU is set out in detail in Appendix 5.&#13;
67.   Agriculture Component. The Agriculture Department will be responsible for implementation of&#13;
the Agriculture Component. Specifically, the Agriculture Department will: finalize detailed technical&#13;
specifications for livestock and farm machinery; prepare bidding documents; carrv out tenders; enter into&#13;
contracts with foreign suppliers and domestic service providers and consultants; supervise the selection&#13;
of eligible fanners and maintain a detailed farmer database; organize the distribution of livestock and&#13;
farm equipment, set up the project monitoring and impact evaluation system; and carry out reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 15 of 24&#13;
requirements. Based on the experience gained in the 199t Federation agriculture project, it is not&#13;
expected that specialized procurement agents would need to be engaged. To facilitate the reception,&#13;
storage and distribution of livestock and farm machinery, regional agricultural experts located in the&#13;
target area for the imported items will be engaged. Final distribution of imported farm equipment and&#13;
livestock will be carried out through and by the municipalities. For the Bank-financed part of the&#13;
Agriculture Component, at least 50 percent of final selected benefiting farmers would be either retuning&#13;
refugees or returning internally displaced persons. Detailed farmer eligibility criteria and the process for&#13;
selection of farmers under the Project are set out in the attached sectoral Appendix.&#13;
68.   Housing Component. The Housing Department will implement the Housing Component. The&#13;
Housing Department will: enter into subsidiary implementation agreements with municipalities, as&#13;
described below; select detailed project sites and buildings; contract out and review detailed damage&#13;
assessments of buildings; contract out and review final designs and tender specifications, prepare bidding&#13;
documents, and carry out tenders; enter into contracts with building contractors and local consultants;&#13;
supervise contracted works and advise the PCU Financial Controller on progress payments to be made to&#13;
contractors; and carry out reporting requirements. The Housing Department will put in place local&#13;
municipal project units that prepare projects and monitor construction, with reliance on contract staff as&#13;
necessary. These units would work with municipalities on day-to-day management of local repair&#13;
projects according to the procedures established for the Component. The local consultants working with&#13;
the municipalities would select the buildings to be repaired; undertake damage assessments; define work&#13;
specifications; monitor construction progress; and certify completion of works for payment. See the&#13;
attached sectoral Annex for more details.&#13;
69.   Water and Sanitation Component.  The Banja Luka office of the Institute for Water&#13;
Management of RS, Zavod za Vodoprivreda, RS (ZVRS) would have the primary responsibility for the&#13;
execution of the Water and Sanitation Component. This office would establish a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU), consisting of several experienced staff from ZVRS and of outside consultants. The PIU&#13;
would be responsible for day-to-day project management, engineering, coordination and supervision. It&#13;
would be supported and supervised by a small Water Department in the PCU. In particular, the PIU&#13;
would: draft terms of reference for and enter into contracts with consultant-engineers preparing designs&#13;
and bidding documents; review final designs and bidding documents and forward them to the Water&#13;
Department for subsequent bidding; prepare bid evaluation reports for the Water Department; draft terms&#13;
of reference for and enter into contracts with consultants for on-site construction supervision; verify bills&#13;
prepared by contractors and checked by site supervisors and forward them to the Water Department for&#13;
payment; and organize distribution of refuse collection equipment to the municipalities. See the attached&#13;
sectoral Annex for more details.&#13;
70.   Electric Power Component. The implementing agencies and beneficiaries under the Electric&#13;
Power Component would be Elektroprenos Banja Luuka which is the transmission company for RS, and&#13;
Elektrokrafina Banja Luuka which is the distribution company for the Banja Luka area and the largest of&#13;
its kind in RS. Both organizations form part of Elekiroprivreda Republika Srpska (EPRS). A Project&#13;
Management Group (PMG) will be set up in Banja Luka under EPRS's supervision and be responsible to&#13;
organize and supervise the rehabilitation of the transmission system and distribution networks in the&#13;
Banja Luka area under the Project. The office of the PMG which will be responsible for day-to-day&#13;
project management, engineering, coordination and supervision, will be established within Elektroprenos&#13;
Banja Luka. The PMG would be supported and supervised by a small Electric Power Department in the&#13;
PCU. Since the replacement of transmission and distribution equipment needs to be carried out under&#13;
operational conditions, installation and related civil works would be implemented through force account&#13;
using technical staff and the workforce of Elektroprenos and Elpktrokrajina. See the attached sectoral&#13;
Annex for more details.&#13;

Onlending and Cost Recovery&#13;
71.   Onlending Arrangements. Regarding the IDA Credit, funds will be lent to the State of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina on IDA terms under a Development Credit Agreement. Receipt of a legal opinion that&#13;
the Development Credit Agreement has been duly executed and is legally binding in accordance with its&#13;
terms would be a condition of credit effectiveness. The State will on-lend the Credit to Republika Srpska&#13;
under a Subsidiary Finance Agreement, acceptable to IDA. RS will make the proceeds of the Credit&#13;
available for project implementation to the PCU, to ZVRS, and to Elektroprivreda RS. In addition, IDA&#13;
and Republika Srpska will enter into a Project Agreement. The execution of the Subsidiary Finance&#13;
Agreement and the Project Agreement, with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and receipt of&#13;
respective legal opinions, would be conditions of effectiveness of the Credit.&#13;
72.   Cost Recovery.  In summary, the arrangements for cost recovery under the four sector&#13;
Components are as follows:&#13;
*  Agriculture.  Benefiting farmers enter into supply and credit agreements with the PCU.  For&#13;
livestock, credit maturity is five years including one year grace, for farm equipment the terms are&#13;
eight years including two years grace. Annual credit interest will be no less than DEM-Libor plus&#13;
300 basis points. Repayments will be made half-yearly on the basis of annuities. Local credit&#13;
institutions will be selected as collecting agents for the RS government.&#13;
* Housing. Benefiting municipalities enter into subsidiary implementation agreements with the PCU.&#13;
The agreements specify the scope and value of repairs financed and define the repayment terms as&#13;
follows: through increased rental charges, repair costs are to be recovered over no more than 30&#13;
years, including 5 years of grace, at no less than 1.75 percent interest per annum. In addition, prior to&#13;
the financing of repairs, municipalities are required to provide a plan and time schedule for re-&#13;
instating rental rates that allow full coverage of operation and maintenance costs within a five year&#13;
period, along with a plan for maintenance of elements that have been repaired through the Project.&#13;
* Water and Sanitation. Benefiting municipalities enter into credit agreements with the PCU, covering&#13;
the cost of urgent works and of refuse collection equipment. The onlending terms are 30 years&#13;
maturity at zero interest including seven years grace. In addition, prior to financing of repair works,&#13;
municipalities are required to submit to ZVRS a time-bound program for raising water charges and&#13;
collections so as to recover recurrent costs of operation and maintenance within three years, and all&#13;
costs including capital investments within seven years.&#13;
* Electric Power. IDA funds will be on-lent by the PCU, representing the RS Government, to&#13;
Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina, at the IDA service charge over a 20-year maturity, including five&#13;
years of grace. The amounts on-lent represent the value of equipment and materials supplied for&#13;
repairs to transmission (Elektroprenos) and to distribution (Elektrokrajina) facilities, respectively.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
73.   The proposed procurement arrangements for the Project are summarized in Table 4. Detailed&#13;
procurement plans, describing the value and number of packages to be financed by the Bank under each&#13;
sectoral Component, are provided in the attached four sectoral Appendices. Whenever applicable, the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used for all procurement activities set out below.&#13;
74.   Goods.  Limited International Bidding (LIB), tendering by invitation, will apply for goods&#13;
contracts above US$ I million contract value, and also for contract packages below that value as&#13;
identified further below. LIB will be used for procurement of farm equipment (one LIB package of two-&#13;
axle tractors, valued at US$ 0.9 million), as well as for procurement of electric power equipment (one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 17 of 24&#13;
package for steel structures, US$ 1.2 million; for paint, US$ 0.5 million; and for MV/ LV equipment,&#13;
US$ 1.4 million). The list of LIB bidders will be as broad as possible. Tfhis list will be based on the&#13;
expressions of interest received in response to the General Procurement Notice which was published in&#13;
Development Business on March 16, 1997, as well as other sources of information. Geographical&#13;
distribution of invited bidders will be considered to the maximum extent possible. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents will be used. The LIB contracts will require prior approval of the Bank relating to&#13;
the list of suppliers.&#13;

75.   International Shopping (IS) will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard&#13;
specification commodities, valued between US$ 200,000 and US$ 1.0 million per contract. IS is based&#13;
on comparison of at least three price quotations obtained from at least two countries. An IS document,&#13;
including contract conditions, has been prepared by the Bank and will be used for IS contracts. The Bank&#13;
would finance: (i) three IS contracts for refuse collection trucks and containers, valued at less then US$&#13;
0.4 million each, at an aggregate value of US$ 0.8 million; (ii) one contract for electric power-related&#13;
testing and maintenance equipment, valued at US$ 0.6 million; and (iii) about six contracts for office&#13;
equipment and vehicles, at an aggregate value of US$ 0.4 million.&#13;
76.   National Shopping (VS) will be used for small office equipment, fumiture and supplies, at&#13;
individual contract values of less than US$ 200,000. NS is based on comparison of price quotations&#13;
obtained from at least three national suppliers. The Bank would finance several small contracts, at values&#13;
below US$ 50,000 per contract, for an aggregate amount of US$ 0.11 million.&#13;
77.   Under the Electric Power Component, the Bank will finance one contract package under Direct&#13;
Contracting (DC) procedures for proprietary items due to reasons of compatibility and standardization.&#13;
This DC package is for equipment and parts for the overhaul of electric power transformers, at a contract&#13;
value of US$ 0.3 million. All DC contracts require prior Bank review. Any Direct Contracting beyond&#13;
the described package will require prior Bank approval.&#13;
78.    Works. Simplified National Competitive Bidding (SNCB) will generally be used for civil works&#13;
contracts for housing and for water and sanitation-related repair works, for works valued at less than US$&#13;
1.0 million per contract. Works contracts will be lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three pre-qualified contractors. Pre-qualification criteria of contractors&#13;
will be subject to prior approval by the Bank. The selection of contractors to be invited to bid for works&#13;
contracts will include the pre-qualified contractors that are judged to be capable to carry out the works in&#13;
question. Bid invitations for works shall provide a detailed description of the works, including technical&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
relevant designs and drawings where applicable. The capacity of the local construction industry, in RS&#13;
and within BH as a whole, to carry out civil works under the project, using SNCB procedures, has been&#13;
assessed and is judged to be adequate (see Appendix 2). All efforts would be made to ensure that a wide&#13;
range of contractors, including foreign contractors, would be invited to bid. State-owned construction&#13;
enterprises must meet the Bank's eligibility criteria of autonomous legal status and absence of&#13;
government subsidies for their operations.&#13;
79.   Under the Housing Component, the Bank would finance about 25 civil works contracts for public&#13;
sector housing repairs, procured under SNCB. The average contract size is estimated at US$ 230,000,&#13;
and contracts are not expected to exceed US$ 400,000. The total value of Bank-financed housing repair&#13;
works is US$ 5.5 million. Prior approval by the Bank will be required of the first ten contracts for public&#13;
sector housing repairs and any contracts exceeding a value of US$ 400,000 equivalent. Prior to the&#13;
initiation of any procurement action, the Housing Department of the PCU will provide the Bank with a&#13;
procurement plan detailing the number of contracts to be procured, bid invitation dates, as well as&#13;
expected start and end dates for each contract.&#13;
80.   Under the Water and Sanitation Component, the Bank would finance about eight civil works&#13;
contracts for repair and rehabilitation of water and sewage systems, procured under SNCB. The average&#13;
contract size is estimated at US$ 400,000. The total value of Bank-financed water and sanitation repair&#13;
works, under SNCB, is US$ 3.0 million. Prior approval by the Bank will be required for the first five&#13;
contracts for urgent works and any contracts exceeding a value of US$ 400,000 equivalent. Prior to the&#13;
initiation of any procurement action, the Water and Sanitation Department of the PCU will provide the&#13;
Bank with a procurement plan detailing the number of contracts to be procured, bid invitation dates, as&#13;
well as expected start and end dates for each contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Pale 19 of 24&#13;
81.   Water and sanitation-related repair works procured under Force Account (FA) would be financed&#13;
by the Bank up to an aggregate limit of US$ 190,000. Force Account would be used for the installation&#13;
of equipment and minor repair works within the capability of the staff of municipal water, sanitation and&#13;
solid waste organizations and valued at less than US$ 50,000 per contract. Using Force Account for&#13;
these small works would save time and costs. To qualify, organizations would need to demonstrate that&#13;
they have the equipment, capacity and experience to undertake the work. Force Account would be paid&#13;
on the basis of pre-agreed prices. An appropriate accounting and supervision mechanism will be put in&#13;
place to ensure cost-effectiveness.&#13;
82.   Services. The Bank would finance agricultural services for handling, storage, assembly, initial&#13;
servicing and local transport of imported farm equipment, at an aggregate value of less than US$ 0.1&#13;
million. The Bank would also finance consultant services for engineering, designs, preparation of&#13;
bidding documents and works supervision, at an aggregate value of US$ 0.2 million. Furthermore, Bank&#13;
financing would be used to procure local and expatriate consultant services for technical assistance,&#13;
training and studies, at a total value of US$ 1.7 million. All of the above services would be procured in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both competition and sole sourcing. Sole sourcing&#13;
would be justified in each case. Such justification may be the timing constraint, continuity, unique&#13;
expertise, and lack of candidates given the post-conflict situation in RS. No assignments have been pre-&#13;
identified for sole sourcing. The "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and&#13;
by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (dated August 1981) will be used for procurement.&#13;
83.   Incremental Operating Costs. The Bank would finance incremental operating expenses of the&#13;
PCU, the PMAU, and ZVRS, up to an aggregate value of US$ 0.13 million. Eligible expenses include&#13;
salaries, utilities, communication expenditures, office and vehicle rental, vehicle maintenance and&#13;
operating costs, and office supplies. Annual budgets and work programs will be agreed with the Bank&#13;
and will be monitored quarterly by the Bank.&#13;
84.   Bank Review. Specific prior review requirements for LIB, DC and SNCB contracts have been&#13;
set out above. In summary, prior Bank review is required for: (i) goods contracts for farm equipment&#13;
using LIB; (ii) any goods contracts using DC; (iii) the first ten SNCB contracts for housing repairs, and&#13;
any housing repair contracts exceeding a value of US$ 400,000 equivalent; and (iv) the first five SNCB&#13;
contracts for water system repairs, and any water system repair contracts exceeding a value of US$&#13;
400,000 equivalent. The Bank will carry out ex-post review of goods procured using IS and NS, and of&#13;
works procured under FA. For service contracts, prior review would be required for: (i) all consultants'&#13;
terms of reference; (ii) contracts above US$ 100,000 for firms; (iii) contracts above US$ 50,000 for&#13;
individuals; and (iv) all sole source contracts. Consultant contracts in a form acceptable to the Bank&#13;
would be used. Prior Bank review would also be required for foreign training or study tours, if any. Post&#13;
review monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through quarterly reporting, which will be part of&#13;
the regular quarterly progress reports under the overall Project.&#13;
85.   Procurement Capacity. From the substantial and encouraging experience gained under the four&#13;
parallel sector projects in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are in implementation since&#13;
mid-1996, it is not expected that procurement agents would need to be engaged.  The Project&#13;
Coordination Unit, assisted by experienced expatriate advisors, including a qualified resident PCU&#13;
Procurement Advisor, is expected to be able to carry out all procurement activities quickly and&#13;
efficiently. The Bank is planning to continue to carry out procurement training seminars for RS&#13;
Govemment staff involved in implementation of Bank-financed projects. A Project launching mission,&#13;
including a procurement workshop, would be held within four weeks after Credit Agreement&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
86.   The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 12.3 million (US$ 17 million equivalent) is expected to be&#13;
disbursed over a period of 30 months after the date of effectiveness. Anticipated IDA disbursements are&#13;
shown in Table 5. The IDA Credit would finance the categories of expenditures outlined in Table 6. The&#13;
Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2000. The Project's closing date would be December 3 1,&#13;
2000.&#13;
87.   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, a Special Account would be&#13;
established in a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank. The Authorized Allocation would be US$ 3.0&#13;
million. This allocation is slightly higher than a standard value of four months of project expenditures&#13;
since, given the experience from the equivalent four projects in the Federation of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, it is expected that the Agriculture and Housing Components would be largely completed&#13;
over the first year, requiring higher initial liquidity. Management of the Special Account would be&#13;
delegated by the State and RS authorities to the PCU to fiuther facilitate rapid project implementation.&#13;
Replenishment applications would be forwarded to the Bank with reconciled bank statements and other&#13;
appropriate documentation.&#13;

88.   Documentation of Expenditure. Disbursements would be based on full documentation of&#13;
expenditures for the following: (i) goods contracts over US$ 400,000; (ii) works contracts over US$&#13;
400,000; (iii) service and consultant contracts over US$ 50,000 for individuals and over US$ 100,000 for&#13;
firms; and (iv) foreign training and study tours, if any. Disbursement for all other expenditures would be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures certified by the PCU Director. The required supporting&#13;
documents would be retained by the PCU for at least one year after the receipt by the Bank of the audit&#13;
report for the year in which the disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available&#13;
for review by auditors and by visiting Bank staff upon request.&#13;
Accounts and Auditing&#13;
89.   The PCU would be responsible for overall financial management of the Project and would&#13;
establish accounting systems acceptable to the Bank, with technical assistance, as required. The PCU&#13;
would be subject to annual external audits by independent auditors, under terms of reference satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. The external auditing finn will be responsible for auditing of all project accounts, the&#13;
Special Account, and all disbursement requests made against Statements of Expenditures. The PCU shall&#13;
submit project financial statements to the Bank no later than four months after the end of each fiscal year,&#13;
and certified copies of the external audit report no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year,&#13;
including income and expenditure statements and the auditor's opinion on whether the PCU is achieving&#13;
its objectives in a cost-effective way and whether internal controls are adequate to minimize the misuse&#13;
of fimds. In addition to these standard auditing requirements for project records, the financial statements&#13;
of Elektroprenos Banja Luka and Elektrokrajina Banja Luka would be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Supervision, Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
90.   Bank Supervision. Due to the complexity of this multi-sector emergency-type Project, and&#13;
given the need for early and visible effects on the ground, intensive supervision is required by the Bank.&#13;
Close supervision would be facilitated by having both the Task Team Leader and a Procurement&#13;
Specialist based in the field at the Resident Mission in Sarajevo. In addition, during the first project year,&#13;
quarterly supervision missions of three-week duration each would be required by specialists in the areas&#13;
of housing, water and sanitation, and electric power, totaling 36 staff weeks of input. During the second&#13;
and third project years, supervision input by sector specialists would be 24 staff weeks annually. A&#13;
formalized mid-term review is not envisaged due to the planned continuos supervision by the Bank.&#13;
91.   Reporting. The PCU would submit quarterly project implementation reports to the Bank,&#13;
according to an agreed format, summarizing implementation progress for each Component and attaching&#13;
detailed financial statements. The specific reporting requirements that are set out in Appendices I&#13;
through 4 for each Project Component would be complied with and fulfilled through the quarterly&#13;
implementation reports.&#13;
92.   Monitoring and Impact Assessment. Performance monitoring indicators have been developed&#13;
for each sectoral Project Component and are listed in Appendices I through 4. These indicators reflect&#13;
the four primary Project objectives.  Bank supervision of the Project will closely monitor these&#13;
indicators. In addition, under the Agriculture Component, a separate monitoring and impact assessment&#13;
system will be put in place at the farmer level, under financing by the Project.&#13;
F. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
93.   Benefits. Major project benefits would include: (i) the fulfillment of some five to ten percent of&#13;
urgent needs to re-install farm power and provide livestock, which would create of about 4,200 rural jobs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 22 of 24&#13;
on fanms located in war-affected areas of RS, raise agricultural and food production, help reduce the need&#13;
for imported donor food aid, and improve food security; (ii) the repair to habitable standards of some 250&#13;
public apartment buildings containing an estimated 4,500 flats, or 12.5 percent of the total damaged&#13;
public housing stock in RS, which would improve quality and quantity of living space in urban war-&#13;
damaged areas and create an estimated 25,000 person-months of temporary construction labor; (iii) the&#13;
restoration of essential urban water, sanitation and solid waste disposal services, in 18 RS municipalities,&#13;
to levels that would make urban centers livable, reduce health risks and support the return of economic&#13;
activity; and (iv) the repair of damaged electric transmission and distribution networks which would&#13;
restore reliable supply of electricity to the Banja Luka area, a pre-condition for normal economic life to&#13;
return to this part of RS. All Project activities would either directly, through provision of livestock and&#13;
farn machinery, or indirectly, through municipal infrastructure repairs, benefit returning refugees and&#13;
internally displaced persons.&#13;
94.    Risks. Project risks are substantial. There is the general risk of a resumption of hostilities in the&#13;
region; it is hoped that rapid reconstruction, in both Entities of BH, would help cement the peace process.&#13;
The main five project-specific risks are: (i) delayed project start-up and implementation; (ii) a continued&#13;
short-fall of donor cofinancing, preventing early and full implementation of all the investment sub-&#13;
components; (iii) farmers' inability to service their credits in a timely manner; (iv) the inability of&#13;
municipalities to operate and adequately maintain repaired houses and water systems in the future; (v) the&#13;
inability of Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina to finance their share of local costs and to carry out electric&#13;
system repair works under the Project. 5&#13;
95.    The first risk of implementation delays will be addressed by making available to the PCU mucl&#13;
of the standard procurement and sample contracting documentation used under the four parallel sector&#13;
projects in the Federation during 1996. Substantial supervision and start-up assistance will also be&#13;
provided by Bank staff and expatriate long-term consultants to the Project. Available donor grant&#13;
financing for project preparation has been used to advance the drafting of detailed designs and bidding&#13;
documents for civil works, to develop technical specifications for goods to be procured, and to set up the&#13;
PCU, prior to project approval by the Bank. The second risk of a continued Project funding gap would&#13;
reduce the envisaged impact of the Project. However, none of the activities to be carried out from&#13;
available financing would depend on mobilization of the full envisaged funding volume. Financing of&#13;
required key technical assistance and implementation support has been ensured. The Bank will make&#13;
every effort to mobilize additional donor cofinancing, and experience from the parallel Federation&#13;
projects suggests that there are good prospects in this respect.&#13;
96.    The third risk relates to a possible lack of incremental farm cash flow of benefiting farmers to&#13;
repay the in-kind credits. Farm models demonstrate that farmers will be able to repay the five-year loan at&#13;
the interest proposed. Similarly, repayments on tractor loans over the eight-year maturity period should&#13;
pose no difficulty, provided farmers rent out their equipment when is not being used by themselves. The&#13;
fourth risk relates to low billings and collections for housing and water services, and hence insufficient&#13;
cost recovery. Charging of fully cost-covering flat rents and water service fees will take time. However,&#13;
to facilitate this process and reduce the associated Project risk, each benefiting municipality is required to&#13;
submit to the Bank a specific plan to recover recurrent and investment costs over time. The fifth risk has&#13;
been addressed through an agreement that, in the event that Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina are unable&#13;
to carry out and finance the local costs associated with electric system repairs in a timely manner, the RS&#13;
A further potential Project risk is the presence of landmine contamination along former confrontation&#13;
lines which could slow down project implementation. However, based on the experience under&#13;
reconstruction projects in the Federation, areas affected by landmines could either be avoided or would&#13;
be cleared of mines using local contractors and funding available under various donor-financed landmine&#13;
projects in the country.&#13;

AGRICULTURE COMPONENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Agriculture in Bosnia's Economy&#13;
1.    Prior to the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) had a population of about 4.4 million people, of&#13;
whom some 68 percent or 3.0 million were of employable age (15-64). Of these about 2 percent were&#13;
employed by state or socially owned farms while a fiuther 16 percent were private sector farmers or farn&#13;
workers. In 1990, primary agriculture's share of GSP' comprised 14 percent and that of forestry, 2&#13;
percent. Overall, BH was a net importer of temperate agriculturl products. The net export of livestock&#13;
products, particularly milk to the Dalmatian coast, was offest by imports of grains and protein meals for&#13;
livestock as well as products for human consumption.&#13;
2.    Because BH is essentially rural, with only 20 percent of the population living in the 10 largest&#13;
towns prior to the war, agriculture impacts on a large proportion of households. The 1981 census&#13;
indicated that there were some 540,000 farm households. Thus, at that time, over half of all households&#13;
were agricultural. It is likely that until 1991, the situation was broadly similar.&#13;
3.    Unlike some other former Yugoslav republics, only a relatively small part of BH's agricultural&#13;
resources were in the 'social sector' - 6.1 percent of agricultural land, negligible numbers of ruminant&#13;
livestock, and about a quarter of the intensive livestock. Forestry, on the other hand is largely State-&#13;
owned. Over three quarters of the forest area, 88 percent of the timber stocks, 88 percent of the annual&#13;
growth increment and about 90 percent of the off-take are within the social sector. Until the late 1980s,&#13;
agro-industry of any significant scale was entirely a social sector business. Only on-farm processing such&#13;
as kitchen-scale production of meat and milk products, or local slaughtering could have been categorized&#13;
as private.&#13;
Agriculture in Republika Srpska&#13;
4.    The Republika Srpska (RS) is geographically divided into two areas: the northem and westem&#13;
area centered on Banja Luka and bounded to the north by the Sava River, and the southem and eastem&#13;
area bounded in the east by the Drina River. The two areas are joined in the north thorough the Posavina&#13;
corridor between Brcko and Derventa. As for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the topography&#13;
of RS is basically mountainous, ranging in altitude between 100 m and 2,000 m, draining mostly&#13;
northwards to the valley of the Sava River or eastwards to the Drina. From the confluence of the two&#13;
rivers near Bijeljina, running westwards up the Sava valley towards Prijedor there is an extensive area of&#13;
relatively flat, fertile land. Soils in the northem area tend to be neutral and relatively fertile while in the&#13;
eastem area they are thinner on karst limestone base.&#13;
Within the former Yugoslavia, the measure of national income was Gross Social Product (GSP), a&#13;
measure which excludes services, except those involved in the transport and distribution of goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
5.     Climate is generally continental with high summer temperatures, reaching up to 41 degrees&#13;
Celsius in Banja Luka and cold winters with minimum temperatures as low as -28 degrees Celsius in&#13;
Banja Luka or even -35 degrees Celsius in Sokolac. Snow may lay for three months or more at altitudes&#13;
above 700 m. Ground water availability and rainfall are generally adequate but it is estimated by the RS&#13;
authorities that over 100,000 hectares would benefit from irrigation, vs. 4,000 hectares that are irrigated&#13;
at present. Flooding is a problem in some areas along the river valleys. Drainage systems cover some&#13;
70,000 hectares but a further 200,000 hectares could be improved by drainage. Average annual rainfall&#13;
varies between 950 mm in the Sarajevo area and up to 1,500 mm in mountainous areas. In the southern&#13;
tip of RS around Trebinje where closeness to the Adriatic Sea provides a warmer climate, there is a&#13;
shortage of water and a particular need for irrigation.&#13;
6.     Of the estimated land area of RS of about 2.5 million hectares, about half is considered&#13;
agricultural land, the remainder being largely mountain and forest. Given an estimated population of up&#13;
to 1.3 million, there is slightly less than 1 hectare of agricultural land per person. Agricultural land in RS&#13;
is composed of arable land and meadows (46 percent), orchards (4 percent) and pastures (50 percent).&#13;
Meadows may be natural lowland grazing or leys in rotation with other crops while pastures include&#13;
extensive tracts of natural grazing on the mountains. The distinction is partly one of slope: arable&#13;
farming is possible on land with slopes up to 20 percent; intensive forage production may be possible on&#13;
land up to 25 percent slope; however, land over the 35 percent limit is only suitable for pasture and even&#13;
then may require attention to hazards of erosion. In RS, the proportions of the first category decline in a&#13;
southerly direction while the proportions of the last category increase towards the south and east (see&#13;
Table 1). Significantly, about 20 percent of the arable land was dedicated to forage crops (from 9 percent&#13;
in Trebinje to 23.4 percent in Vlasenica) while a further 22 percent (and up to 48.5 percent in Trebinje)&#13;
was either fallow or meadows on arable land.&#13;

Pre-war Structure and Characteristics&#13;
7.     Land ownership throughout BH had previously been largely private with about 94 percent of&#13;
agricultural land belonging to individuals2. As a result of the war and considerable movement of&#13;
refugees, the issue of land ownership is critical within an agricultural development strategy in the&#13;
medium-term. With an average size of 3 to 5 hectares, the average farm is small and largely&#13;
inappropriate for modem mechanized farming. This is exacerbated by land fragmentation. This&#13;
fragmentation is particularly constraining in the flatter areas where mechanization would otherwise be&#13;
possible. In the hill areas, farm size is typically larger than in the plains and units are more often&#13;
2    The pasture area which accounts for some 37 percent of private land is thought not to be generally owned&#13;
by individual farmers but rather to belong to farmers communally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;

consolidated. The substantial movement of population which has taken place during more than three&#13;
years of war has caused that, in many areas, people who are occupying land are not those with legal title&#13;
to it.&#13;
8.    Private farming systems in BH are largely mixed. In 1981, there were 370,000 full time workers&#13;
on the 233,000 private farms with workers - about one worker per three hectares of cropped land.&#13;
Generally, low-output mixed farming systems are followed; small areas of cereals and other crops are&#13;
produced as well as vegetables and fruit (principally plums and apples) for the household. Most farms&#13;
tend to have some livestock also, cattle being the most widely held type. Indeed, in 1981 more than&#13;
seventy percent of all private farms had at least one cow. Additionally, over half of al farms exceeding 3&#13;
hectares in size, kept pigs. Sheep were less widely owned with only 20 percent of farmers owning any&#13;
sheep at all, but among these, some 24,000 farmers (about 5 percent of all farms) had at least 20 head.&#13;
Substantial sheep flocks are most common in areas with access to communal mountain pasture.&#13;
9.    Crop yields in BH prior to the war were generally poor when compared with those of Former&#13;
Yugoslavia as a whole. Yields of cereals averaged nearly 20 percent below those for Yugoslavia as a&#13;
whole. Performance of potatoes and vegetables was relatively worse. Only with tobacco did BH achieve&#13;
a higher average yield than Former Yugoslavia as a whole. Compared with westem Europe, BH average&#13;
yields are only about half for cereals, potatoes and vegetables, and less than half for clover. Although&#13;
BH conditions are not ideal for the crops grown, yield levels reported on some of the more efficient units&#13;
in the past suggest there is substantial room for technical improvement.&#13;
10.   The organization of agricultural support services is in a transition phase both in RS and the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Before the war there were some 1,200 professional&#13;
agriculturalists (including animal husbandry) in BH. New agricultural extension services for private&#13;
farmers are not yet operational. Municipal agricultural staff is providing advice to farmers, but not in a&#13;
planned and structured manner. Agricultural research is to be carried out in Agricultural Institutes, but&#13;
due to staff and funding shortage and destruction of facilities, only limited research is presently being&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
Farm Mechanization&#13;
11.   Farm mechanization levels in pre-war BH were relatively high. In the mechanization drive&#13;
which followed the establishment of a tractor and combine manufacture in Former Yugoslavia, in the&#13;
1950s, farmers were offered subsidized prices and highly attractive credit terms for the acquisition of&#13;
farm machinery. Figures provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources&#13;
(MAFWR) of RS indicate a rate of one tractor per 41 hectares of arable land, or roughly I HP per&#13;
hectare.&#13;
12.   These figures reveal a somewhat different picture in RS from that found in the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina where much high higher levels of mechanization prevailed, reported at 14.6&#13;
hectares per tractor or some 2.8 HP per hectare. This is probably due to the larger number of part-time&#13;
farmers in the more industrialized Federation area where a higher level of capital investment in farm&#13;
machinery prevailed. There was and still is today a larger degree of reliance on single-axle motor-&#13;
cultivators in the area of today's Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while this type of small&#13;
equipment is less common in the area of RS.&#13;
13.   In RS, every third to fourth farming family is said to have had a 40 HP tractor and a fairly&#13;
complete set of implements for cultivation, seeding and fodder production, even though no more than&#13;
two or three hectares might be cultivated per farm. The comparison of reported tractor numbers for 1991&#13;
of 14,250 units with the arable land area and average farm size suggests that the number of farms per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
Page 4 of 23&#13;
tractor was somewhat higher (11.5) than the above reported number. Prior to the war, there was a high&#13;
degree of multi-farm use of fann equipment through informal arrangements between relatives and&#13;
neighbors, recompensed in kind rather then in cash. Also, tractors were widely used throughout BH for&#13;
transport and fuelwood production during the winter season. Grain harvesting by contract with local&#13;
combine-owning cooperatives (Zadrugas) was virtually the only operation for which farmers relied on&#13;
outside assistance.&#13;
14.   About 80 percent of pre-war tractors in BH were of the IMT brand produced in Belgrade under&#13;
foreign license, and implements, too, were locally produced. Support services were available from a&#13;
network of local workshops and parts stockists dependent on nation-wide machinery trading&#13;
conglomerates and import/export companies. Also, associated with the near monopoly enjoyed by the&#13;
main domestic tractor manufacturer and the consequently high degree of standardization, a strong body of&#13;
skills and expertise in operation, maintenance and minor repair was built up among the farmer-owners of&#13;
the equipment as well as local mechanics and part outlets.&#13;
Livestock Production&#13;
15.   Livestock production is important in both Entities of BH, particularly cattle and sheep. While&#13;
the area of main crops grown in BH only represented 12 percent of that in the former Yugoslavia, its herd&#13;
of breeding cows and of breeding sheep amounted to 25 percent and 18 percent respectively of the former&#13;
national totals. The vast majority of livestock were in the private sector. Only with intensive livestock,&#13;
especially poultry (37 percent) and pigs (19 percent) did the socialist sector control a significant&#13;
proportion of the herd.&#13;
16.   Pre-war technical performance from livestock was quite poor and generally below that in other&#13;
parts of the formner Yugoslavia except in the case of sheep meat production. For example, the milk&#13;
produced per cow per year, which is a key dairying performance indicator, is under 1,500 liters in BH&#13;
and only 83 percent of the average for the former Yugoslavia. This is only about one third of that&#13;
achieved by average dairy fanns in western Europe. RS authorities aim to raise average milk production&#13;
to 2,000 liters by the year 2,001 and to 3,500 liters over the following decade. Poor livestock&#13;
performance is due to limited availability of feed as well as the lack of extension service to private&#13;
farmers; professional agricultural services were devoted to large-scale farns in the socially-owned sector&#13;
on which extensive management systems were practiced and where reasonable yields, regardless of&#13;
economic considerations, were obtained.&#13;
17.   The pre-war cattle population of BH of some 950,000 head were largely maintained by private&#13;
farmers. These were kept on small-holdings and individual herd sizes were small, frequently of less than&#13;
six heads. Simmental and Brown Swiss dual purpose type cattle were kept for the production of meat&#13;
and milk. Milk is mostly sold privately. Some 4 percent of the cattle population were maintained on&#13;
State farms. These institutions kept Holstein-Friesian type cows, largely on intensive zero grazing&#13;
systems, typically making corn silage as the maintenance ration and feeding concentrates for production.&#13;
A limited number of Holstein-Friesian cattle are also kept by the private sector.&#13;
18.   Prior to the war, the sheep population of BH is estimated at 1.3 million. Sheep fulfill a triple&#13;
purpose role producing milk for cheese making, a light yield of coarse wool, and meat. The pre-war goat&#13;
population is estimated at 95,000. Goat husbandry would be complementary to cattle and sheep&#13;
husbandry. Pigs were kept on a fairly large scale in BH by State farns, more commonly in the north of&#13;
the country on today's RS territory. Most farms fattened two or three pigs, slaughtered their own pigs&#13;
and produced smoked meat and sausages for the winter period. Poultry were also produced on State&#13;
farms both for eggs and broiler production. Poultry keeping is common throughout the country in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 5 of 23&#13;
backyard systems, but also in larger numbers in cages and in deep litter houses. With the rapid&#13;
reproductive capabilities of pigs and poultry, importations of these species appear not be of priority.&#13;
19.   An examination of livestock numbers in January 1992 compared with the feed availability for&#13;
them indicates that BH was in significant livestock feed deficit. The apparent shortage of feed is&#13;
consistent with the poor livestock performance achieved. Clearly the development focus within the&#13;
livestock sector should be to equate numbers with feed availability, specialize and concentrate on&#13;
improving technical performance. Destruction of livestock during the war period has largely corrected&#13;
the livestock food imbalance.&#13;
20.   The animal health situation in BH used to be comparable with westem Europe and disease&#13;
control measures have been implemented for many years. Where war has largely disrupted vaccination&#13;
programs there is concem about the re-emergence of rabies. With the unsettled situation in the area, with&#13;
refugee movements with livestock continuing, and with the prevailing disease situation in countries to the&#13;
east, FMD and possibly rinderpest are potential threats. The condition of veterinary stations in RS is&#13;
reported to vary from partial destruction to adequate and, in a limited number of cases, elaborate. The&#13;
Veterinary Institute in Banja Luka is generally operational. Throughout BH artificial insemination&#13;
services are provided by the field veterinary stations. The RS authorities desire to raise artificial&#13;
insemination coverage from a present 20 percent to 35 percent by the year 2,001.&#13;
War-related Damage and Current Situation&#13;
21.   Unlike in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, war-related damage to agriculture in RS is&#13;
very much dependent on the specific circumstances in each region and the extent and duration of&#13;
hostilities as well as the number of times teiritory changed hands. For example, in the southern part of&#13;
the Banja Luka region, including the municipalities of Mrkonjic Grad, Ribnik and Sipovo which is&#13;
known as the Anvil Area, the local population was displaced several times and large shares of livestock&#13;
and farm machinery were lost. In addition, the former confrontation lines were heavily mined. Because&#13;
the rural economy and in particular agricultural production has been effectively destroyed in this area,&#13;
rural families have tended to remain either in refugee status or lodged in local towns where they impose&#13;
an additional burden on already fragile housing conditions.&#13;
22.   For RS as a whole, reliable current livestock and farm machinery numbers are not available.&#13;
Estimates indicate a significantly smaller reduction of livestock due to the war in RS than in the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina where, in some areas, up to 70 percent of the pre-war livestock&#13;
was lost. Overall damage estimates for war-related livestock losses in RS are in the 30 percent range.&#13;
Priority import requirements suggested by the RS Government equal 16,000 pregnant heifers, 260,000&#13;
sheep, 190,000 pigs, and 14,000 horses. In the most war-affected areas of RS, the potential for sustained&#13;
livestock production, in the absence of livestock imports, is well below that in 1991 as a result of the&#13;
diminished herds. Regarding farm machinery, the RS authorities estimate a loss of 40 percent of the pre-&#13;
war farm machinery which they translate into an urgent replacement requirement of some 5,700 tractors,&#13;
1,800 combines, and 13,000 other agricultural machines.&#13;
23.   In Mrkonjic Grad alone, some 5,000 farming families of a pre-war total of 8,000 farms reportedly&#13;
lost all their livestock, including 17,000 breeding cows, 80,000 sheep and 18,000 pigs. A similar picture&#13;
emerges in Sipovo. In both municipalities only about 10 percent of tractors was found when the&#13;
population returned after the end of hostilities. The complete lack of mechanized farm power in heavily&#13;
war-damaged areas implies that neither cultivation nor harvesting can be undertaken at the present time.&#13;
This applies particularly to the production of fodder crops, including hay. Without livestock, farm&#13;
families returning to areas with heavy agricultural losses are denied the opportunity to generate cash&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

23.income, and without farm machinery they can neither grow crops nor provide fodder for any livestock&#13;
they may intend to acquire. Even a return to manual methods is often unlikely because of the loss of&#13;
hand tools.&#13;
Reconstruction Achievements in 1996&#13;
24.   No major reconstruction as taken place in the agriculture sector in RS since the end of the&#13;
hostilities. Starting in Spring of 1996, mostly privately organized efforts in RS lead to repairing of&#13;
houses and farm buildings. In some cases, farmers have been able to borrow cattle and equipment from&#13;
relatives elsewhere in RS or in neighboring FRY. In other cases cows have been purchased from state&#13;
farms in exchange for hay. As much as ten tons of hay, harvested manually, has reportedly been charged&#13;
for a cow of indifferent quality and more hay then had to be stocked for winter feed.&#13;
25.   During and after the war, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and a number&#13;
of NGOs have contributed to provide RS farmers with urgent farm inputs such as seed, fertilizer and&#13;
pesticides, also hand tools, however in relatively small quantities. Bilateral aid has contributed animals&#13;
and agricultural inputs to about 1,000 families in the Banja Luka area, and also fruit, vegetable and&#13;
livestock inputs in the Srbinje region located in south-eastern part of RS. In summary, while there has&#13;
been some initial success during 1996 in making farm houses habitable and assist a small number of&#13;
farmers with urgent inputs, little has been achieved in the most war-damaged areas of RS to re-start&#13;
agricultural production, especially in RS municipalities located along the former confrontation line.&#13;
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
26.   To assist the Bosnian authorities to rebuild the agriculture sector of BH, the Bank is committed&#13;
to assist the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and RS to address the most basic and urgent&#13;
reconstruction needs through emergency-type projects. In the Federation, in March 1996, the Bank&#13;
approved a US$ 20 million Credit for an Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project (FY96). Together with&#13;
other donor partners such as the European Union, the Intemational Fund for Agricultural Development&#13;
(IFAD), and the governments of Saudi Arabia, Germany and the Netherlands, through that project the&#13;
Bank is assisting the Federation authorities to import and distribute to some 10,000 farmers livestock and&#13;
essential farm equipment, along with repairs to some 40 veterinary service stations. The proposed&#13;
Reconstruction Assistance Project is the equivalent emergency project designed to assist the RS&#13;
authorities in a similar manner. The Bank is also committed to support an Emergency Wood Supply and&#13;
Forest Management Project which is covering urgent reconstruction needs in the forestry sector in both&#13;
Entities of Bosnia.&#13;
27.   The Bank's support to Bosnia's agriculture sector is part of the agreed international&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation program for agriculture and the rural areas of BH of about US$ 300&#13;
million, to be implemented over three to four years, which the Bank has helped to develop in a joint&#13;
effort with the country and the donor community.3 The agriculture sector program calls for an energetic&#13;
campaign to restore devastated farms and to intensify ongoing efforts to provide the desperately needed&#13;
equipment, livestock, and farm inputs that will augment agricultural production (see Table 2).&#13;
3    See: "Bosnia and Herzegovina: The Priority Reconstruction Program", Vol. 3, Reconstruction Sector&#13;
Reports, made available for the Donor Information Meeting in Brussels, January 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

28.    At the same time, efforts will be made to establish a solid policy frarnework and provide other&#13;
key investments to assist agriculture to evolve into a competitive and productive economic sector in the&#13;
future. Agricultural sector work during 1997 will provide the basis for further Bank involvement in&#13;
Bosnia's agriculture sector beyond the initial emergency reconstruction period. The key sectoral issues&#13;
to be addressed in the medium term are as follows: raising farm productivity by introducing agricultural&#13;
extension and other farmer support services, including agricultural credit; clarifying contested ownership&#13;
rights to agricultural land and farm buildings; promoting sector growth by building up agricultural&#13;
product markets and helping farmers to associate with each other to jointly purchase inputs and market&#13;
outputs; and restructuring and privatizing state farms and agro-processing enterprises.&#13;

Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
29..   Through the early start of the Emergency Farrm Reconstruction Project in the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bank was able to assist the Federation to secure substantial additional donor&#13;
cof.nancing to quickly rebuild small private farms. The presence of the Bank and its oversight over&#13;
project implementation provided comfort to many donors. It is expected that the Bank's support for an&#13;
agricultural rehabilitation program in RS would result in a similar success to raise donor funding. The&#13;
Bank's emergency-type support for rebuilding Bosnia's farms is based on a number of objectives: First,&#13;
to reduce the country's dependence on donor-financed imported food aid by jump-starting domestic&#13;
agricultural production; second, to provide rural employment and income opportunities, including for&#13;
returning refugees and displaced persons, and especially in areas of heavy war damage since agriculture&#13;
will often be the only source of rural employment for years to come; and third, to improve the country's&#13;
prospects to re-start exports of high-value agricultural products such as meat and dairy products, fruits&#13;
and vegetables, and wine.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/ IDA Experience&#13;
30.    There are several key lessons leamed from the Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project which&#13;
has been implemented and substantially completed in the Federation since April 1996. These have been&#13;
incorporated into the proposed project and are as follows:&#13;
*  Breeding cattle and small-scale farm  equipment are the most suitable farm  inputs to quickly&#13;
reactivate farming and agricultural production, and there is very strong domestic demand for them.&#13;
* Farm machinery is best supplied in complete packages, including all required implements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
Page 8 of 23&#13;
*  Veterinary follow-on support is an integral part of a farmer credit package, ensuring veterinary&#13;
coverage for a one-year period after delivery of the livestock to the farmers.&#13;
* Project areas are best confined to a small number of well-defined priority regions. While an Entity-&#13;
wide implementation may be more equitable, it adds to implementation complexity.&#13;
*  In order to ensure that retuming refugees and internally displaced persons benefit from the project,&#13;
the implementing agency needs to reach out early on to UNHCR and other institutions where these&#13;
persons are registered. An agreed specified percentage of project beneficiaries should be refugees&#13;
retuming from abroad, provided their present wealth and income situation merits support.&#13;
* Finally, early installation of the project monitoring system will allow for baseline farm surveys and&#13;
the timely establishment of an impact evaluation survey framework.&#13;
Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
31.   The agriculture component of the Reconstruction Assistance Project will complement, in part,&#13;
the other components of this project (housing, water and sanitation, and electric energy) by generating&#13;
employment and income opportunities for returning refugees and displaced persons. Since there will be&#13;
one joint Project Coordination Unit established for all four components, it will be possible to target&#13;
selected municipalities where two or more project components provide benefits to the same population,&#13;
thus following an integrated area approach to economic reconstiuction. Complementarity also exists&#13;
with respect to other Bank-supported projects in RS: the Local Initiatives Project (FY97) which aims to&#13;
support pennanent employment through loans to micro and small businesses in RS, some of which could&#13;
be farms seeking to finance the purchase of seasonal farm inputs; and the IFC-supported commercial&#13;
micro-credit bank which would provide loans to small enterprises, which may include agro-processing&#13;
businesses in the vicinity of farmers benefiting from the Reconstruction Assistance Project, thus creating&#13;
demand for their produce.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
32.   The primary objective of the Agriculture Component is to assist economically-disadvantaged&#13;
and war-affected farmers in RS restart and strengthen their farming activities and make the transition&#13;
from dependence on humanitarian assistance to active, independent rural employment. This will be&#13;
achieved by providing farmers with in-kind credits for livestock and farm machinery. The primary target&#13;
group are retuming refugee-farmers and internally displaced persons. The project will aim at the private&#13;
farm sector, with a priority for full-time farmers. The emergency reconstruction phase in RS calls for&#13;
projects with fast, direct impact on the ground; hence component design has been kept straightforward&#13;
such as to allow for speedy implementation.&#13;
33.   The secondary objective of the Agriculture Component is to raise agricultural and food&#13;
production in war-affected areas of RS. Increasing farm production will help reduce the need for&#13;
imported donor food aid, improve food security, assist in the development of local green markets,&#13;
provide needed inputs for agro-processing enterprises in RS, and eventually enable RS to trade and&#13;
export food products.&#13;
Component Elements&#13;
34.   To support the above objectives, the Agriculture Component has three elements: (i) livestock&#13;
development; (ii) farm mechanization; and (iii) farn surveys and technical support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 9 of 23&#13;
Element 1: Livestock Development&#13;
35.   To assist in the initial rebuilding of the RS herds for milk and meat production, the project would&#13;
finance the purchase of breeding cattle, to be kept by private individual small-scale farmers. Livestock&#13;
would be distributed to farmers on the basis of in-kind supply and credit arrangements, described further&#13;
below. The livestock development element has the below-described sub-elements. See Table 3 for&#13;
detailed cost estimates.&#13;
36.   Importation of cattle. A total of about 3,000 pregnant heifers of the Simmental, Brown Swiss,&#13;
Grey Tyrol, and/or Holstein-Friesian breeds would be imported for distribution to farmers who have lost&#13;
cattle and have the necessary experience and capability of caring for them. These breeds are well&#13;
accepted in the respective areas and being dual purpose breeds have both meat and milk potential.&#13;
Technical specifications and bidding documents are readily available for these four breeds since they&#13;
were imported during 1996 under the equivalent program in the Federation. The final numbers of&#13;
different breeds to be procured will depend on farmer demand, expressed through farm surveys. The cost&#13;
estimate includes delivery by the supplier to specified quarantine areas within RS. The number of&#13;
imported cattle for this emergency project is substantial, but nevertheless modest enough to take into&#13;
account the considerable logistical problems of the transport of large numbers of animals to 'war-tom&#13;
areas.&#13;
37.   Quarantine. handling. local transport. The project will finance the cost of mandatory quarantine&#13;
in livestock stations within RS. Experience from the 1996 Federation. project suggests to keep the&#13;
quarantine period at a minimum, say no more than two weeks. Contracts will be entered into between&#13;
the Project Coordination Unit and the respective quarantine stations, covering supply of feed and water,&#13;
as well as all required veterinary inspections and clearances. The project will also finance the transport&#13;
by local transporters from the quarantine areas to benefiting municipalities. Standard contracts are&#13;
available from the 1996 Federation project.&#13;

38.   Veterinary support for one year. The project will finance one-year contracts with local veterinary&#13;
stations to monitor the health and productivity of imported heifers. Contract payments will be linked to&#13;
successful birth of the first calf and subsequent artificial insemination during the first year. Contracts&#13;
will be entered into between the Project Coordination Unit and the mostly private veterinarians&#13;
concemed.&#13;
Element 2: Farm Mechanization&#13;
39.   The project would provide an initial emergency supply of critically needed farm mechanization&#13;
equipment, including single-axle motor-cultivators and small- to medium-size two-axle tractors. Tractors&#13;
would be provided in packages including all required implements and basic spare parts. Spare parts for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 10 of 23&#13;
existing machinery are not considered at the moment because (i) the machinery is rather aged and does&#13;
not merit major repairs; (ii) the project would aim to provide fanrers with only major equipment that&#13;
they cannot afford from their own financial resources at the present time; (iii) the cost of logistics&#13;
required to provide the needed spare parts through the project would probably not justify the expected&#13;
benefits since, even after repair, most of the remaining farm equipment is likely not to deliver satisfactory&#13;
performance. All equipment would be provided on the basis of in-kind supply and credit arrangements.&#13;
See Table 4 for dc.ailed cost estimates.&#13;
40.    The supply of machines and implements through the project would involve, where appropriate,&#13;
existing dealers or worl'shops for agricultural machinery in order to promote private sector initiatives in&#13;
this sector. Suppliers of machines would be obliged to provide training for dealers and workshops&#13;
regarding repair, maintenance and handling of the new machines. They would also ensure that the future&#13;
supply of spare and replacement parts is guaranteed through commercial channels. These arrangements&#13;
have proven to be successful in the Federation.&#13;
41.    Two-axle tractors. Lack of farm power is one of the major constraints to increase agricultural&#13;
production in the war-tom areas of RS. As a result, large areas of arable land are not cultivated at&#13;
present. In view of the difficult topography of BH and the small farm structure in the private sector, large&#13;
tractors cannot be used. 'Under the Sroject, a total of about 150 standard two-axle, two-wheel drive&#13;
tractors would be provided in the engine range of 25-35 kW. Each tractor would be accompanied by a set&#13;
of equipment comprising a trailer, plough, rotaiy cultivator, and mower. This would provide for basic&#13;
primary and secondary cultivation operations, fodder harvesting and transport. Detailed technical&#13;
specifications and bidding documents in line with Bank guidelines are available from the 1996&#13;
Federation project.&#13;
42.    Single-axle tractors/ 4notor-cultivators.  For the provision of single-axle tractors, the same&#13;
rationale applies as for the two-axle tractors. The main objective is to increase availability of farm&#13;
power, especially for very small farms or in extremely hilly areas. As the use of these single-axle tractors&#13;
is mainly for agriculture, and in view of the heavy soils that are predominant in some parts of RS, a total&#13;
of 400 medium- to large size single-axle tractors will be provided under the project in the 7-9 kW range.&#13;
gets will include implements including trailer, plough, rotary cultivator, and grass mower. Half of the&#13;
trailers would be PTO-driven for use in mountainous communities. As for two-axle tractors, technical&#13;
specifications and bidding documents are readily available.&#13;

43.    Initial servicing. handling. local transport. The project will finance the reception, assembly,&#13;
initial servicing, handling, and local transport of tractors to the recipient farmers. Contracts will be&#13;
entered into between the Project Coordination Unit and the respective local mechanized farm service&#13;
stations as well as local transporters.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 11 of 23&#13;
Element 3: Farm Surveys and Technical Support&#13;
44.   The project would finance detailed farm surveys, to be carried out in the agreed RS target areas&#13;
as a basis for confirming specific farmer interest and identif~ying eligible farmers. Survey questionnaires&#13;
have been prepared. Surveys would be undertaken by qualified local consultants with a background in&#13;
agriculture. The project will also finance essential technical support from expatriate advisors with a&#13;
background in livestock production and farm mechanization. They would support and advise the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit throughout the process of procurement, contracting, reception and distribution of&#13;
imported livestock and farm machinery. To the extent possible, the same individuals would be engaged&#13;
who helped start up the equivalent Federation project during 1996. RS Government resources would be&#13;
used to extend this expatriate technical support beyond the planned period, if required. The operating&#13;
costs of the staff of the Agriculture Department of the Project Coordination Unit itself are included in the&#13;
Implementation Support Component of the overall project.&#13;
45.   The project would also finance the establishment and running for 12 months of a project&#13;
monitoring and impact evaluation system. This would involve domestic agronomists as well as support&#13;
from an expatriate monitoring expert. The system will need to be operational prior to delivery of the first&#13;
livestock or tractor to allow for baseline farm surveys. Relevant experience on the establishment of such&#13;
a monitoring system is available from work carried out by FAO in the Federation in early 1997.&#13;

Component Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
46.   The total estimated cost of the component is shown in Table 6. Physical contingencies of 3&#13;
percent on goods (livestock and farm equipment) are included. No price contingencies have been&#13;
included given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Donor-financed items&#13;
under the intemational reconstruction program are tax-exempt in RS.&#13;

47.   Of the total component cost, the World Bank would finance US$ 1.0 million equivalent. The&#13;
World Bank contribution would finance the import of about 50 units of two-axle tractors (25-35 kW&#13;
engine power) with implements, including associated costs for handling, servicing and local transport,&#13;
and in part the cost of the expatriate farm mechanization advisor and some of the local consultant&#13;
services. Donor cofinancing for the balance of component costs has been committed in part by the&#13;
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) at an amount of US$ 5.0 million, financing the&#13;
livestock development element of this component. Additional financing of US$ 4.2 million equivalent is&#13;
being sought from other donors (see financing plan shown in Table 7).&#13;

Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
48.   The component is designed to meet between 5 and 10 percent of the urgent needs to re-install&#13;
farm power and provide livestock breeding material to make up for war-related damage in RS. The&#13;
resulting benefits of these activities refer both to a return to productive use of land currently not in&#13;
production, and to increased output on land already in production. As a main benefit, in addition to&#13;
incremental farm and food output, the component would generate employment and income for the rural&#13;
population in war-tom areas of RS. This would particularly benefit retuming refugees and internally&#13;
displaced persons, through increased opportunities for full-time work and farming on lands formerly&#13;
farmed on a part-time basis only. Based on an estimated incremental, permanent rural employment&#13;
impact of I employed person per imported cattle, 2, employed persons per motor-cultivator and 3&#13;
employed persons per two-axle tractor, the project would generate up to 4,200 new jobs.&#13;
49.   The expected agricultural production increase from farm mechanization is being supported by the&#13;
supply of donor-financed urgent farm inputs, such as seeds, fertilizer and pesticides, during 1997 and&#13;
1998 for the spring and autumn planting seasons, organized under the umbrella of the FAO. The&#13;
machinery provided under the proposed project would typically be used to cultivate land not planted&#13;
during the previous year. The 150 two-axle tractors and 400 motor-cultivators are likely to result in&#13;
incremental cultivation of some 5,000 ha (20 ha per tractor and 5 ha per motor-cultivator). The increase&#13;
in food crops (mainly cereals and potatoes) is estimated at some 15,000 tons of grains and some 3,000&#13;
tons of potatoes, in addition to incremental fodder production as livestock feed. Other income and&#13;
benefits would stem from plowing and transport services for fellow farmers without mechanized farm&#13;
power. With benefits valued at current intemational prices, the farm mechanization component is&#13;
expected to yield economic rates of return in excess of 12 percent. Incremental production as a result of&#13;
the livestock component would consist of additional milk, cheese, and meat. Rates of return on the&#13;
livestock component would also be high and at least above the 12 percent level. Additional substantial&#13;
benefits would arise from the reduction and eventual phase-out of donor-financed food aid deliveries into&#13;
RS through substitution of the incremental domestic agricultural production for imported food. The&#13;
amounts saved on food aid would be available for firther donor investments in agricultural production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 13 of 23&#13;
50.   The main component risks relate to delays in implementation and farmers' potential inability to&#13;
repay credits on time. Implementation may be delayed substantially due to a slow start-up of&#13;
procurement, farmer selection, and preparation of farmer credit contracts. To reduce this risk, most of the&#13;
procurement and sample contracting documentation used for the parallel project carried out during 1996&#13;
in the Federation will be made available to the Agriculture Department. The selection of farmers through&#13;
farm surveys will be carried out as early as possible. Experienced expatriate experts that helped start up&#13;
the Federation project will be deployed to RS. The second main risk relates to a possible lack of&#13;
incremental farm cash flow of benefiting farmers to repay the in-kind credits. From the Federation&#13;
project, the experience gained is that many farmers started to pre-pay on their credits, hoping to obtain&#13;
additional livestock and equipment, although this was mostly done out of non-farm income. Farm&#13;
models demonstrate that farmers will be able to repay the five-year loan at the interest proposed.&#13;
Similarly, repayments on tractor loans over the eight-year maturity period should pose no difficulty,&#13;
provided farmers rent out their equipment when is not being used by themselves.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
51.   The Reconstruction Assistance Project has been placed in environmental category B. All items&#13;
procured under the Agriculture Component which present an opportunity for environmental enhancement&#13;
will be specified accordingly, and item usage will be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is&#13;
no degradation to the environment.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Component Organization&#13;
52.   An Agriculture Department for implementation of the Agriculture Component of the proposed&#13;
project will be established within the new Project Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Finance of RS,&#13;
located in Banja Luka. Staff of this Agriculture Department will be seconded from the MAFWR of RS.&#13;
The Department will be headed by a Department Director who will report to the General Director of the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit. In addition to the two expatriate advisors for livestock development and farn&#13;
mechanization, the Agriculture Department Director will have five local staff: a livestock expert, a&#13;
mechanization expert, an agricultural economist, and two support staff. The staff and operational cost of&#13;
the Agriculture Department are included in the Implementation Support Component of the overall&#13;
project. The Agriculture Department will initially be operating for a 12 month period, to be extended&#13;
under RS Government financing if required.&#13;
53.   The Agriculture Department will be responsible for all aspects of implementation of the&#13;
Agriculture Component, except for aspects of Credit disbursements and payments to suppliers which will&#13;
be handled by the PCU Financial Controller. Specifically, the Agriculture Department will: finalize&#13;
detailed technical specifications for livestock and farm machinery, prepare bidding documents, carry out&#13;
tenders, enter into contracts with foreign suppliers and domestic service providers and consultants,&#13;
supervise the selection of eligible farmers and maintain a detailed farmer database, organize the&#13;
distribution of livestock and farm equipment, set up the project monitoring and impact evaluation system,&#13;
and carry out reporting requirements. Based on the experience gained in the 1996 Federation project, it is&#13;
not expected that specialized procurement agents would need to be engaged.&#13;
54.   To ensure better local implementation of the reception, storage and distribution of imported&#13;
livestock and farm machinery, the Agriculture Department will engage the services of regional&#13;
agricultural experts located in the target area for the imported items. These experts will be hired as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
Page 14 of 23&#13;
consultants on a short-term basis starting from the time of livestock and equipment arrival through the&#13;
period of delivery of the last items to the farmers. The Agriculture Department will arrange for work&#13;
space and office facilities for these experts at the municipalities in the target area where they are based.&#13;
Final distribution of imported farm equipment and livestock will be carried out through and by the&#13;
municipalities in the target area for the Agriculture Component, assist by the agricultural experts&#13;
employed by the Agriculture Department.&#13;
Selection of Eligible Farmers&#13;
55.    To allow for effective reconstruction of selected rural war-damaged communities in RS, the&#13;
Agriculture Component will focus on a target area that is commonly called the "anvil area", located&#13;
generally south of the city of Banja Luka where heavy fighting during the hostilities has caused very&#13;
substantial damage to the agriculture sector. The three main benefiting areas will be the municipalities of&#13;
Mrkonjic Grad, Ribnik, and Sipovo. Other war-affected target areas and municipalities may be agreed on&#13;
during project implementation, provided this is based on mutual agreement between the financing donors&#13;
and the RS authorities.&#13;
56.    Based on the recent project experience gained in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the&#13;
following farmer selection process will be followed in RS:&#13;
*  First, municipal farm damage and needs surveys will be carried out by the Agriculture Department in&#13;
the target area, using local consultants. Surveys will include all present farmers in the area,&#13;
providing evidence on their fulfillment of the below-stated eligibility criteria, and specifying their&#13;
interest to purchase livestock and/or farm machinery under the project.&#13;
*  Second, the Agriculture Department will contact UNHCR and a variety of NGOs to obtain names of&#13;
refugee farmers living abroad, or farmers intemally displaced within Bosnia, that are interested to&#13;
return to their farm and property located within the above target area. UNHCR and NGOs will be&#13;
provided with the same survey forms used for the municipal farm surveys, and interested refugees&#13;
will be required to demonstrate their eligibility and to indicate their interest to purchase livestock&#13;
and/or farm machinery.&#13;
*  Third, the Agriculture Department will reconcile both lists of farmers for each municipality. Farmers&#13;
which fail to demonstrate compliance with the mandatory elements of the eligibility criteria will be&#13;
taken off the lists. On the basis of the consolidated lists, the Agriculture Department will allocate the&#13;
aggregate numbers of livestock heads and farm machines to each of the municipalities in the target&#13;
area.&#13;
*  Fourth, the municipalities will be provided with the consolidated lists of farners for their&#13;
municipality, and the total available number of livestock and farm equipment allocated to their area.&#13;
Each municipality will make the final selection of farmer-beneficiaries and communicate the final&#13;
listings to the Agriculture Department.&#13;
57.    For the World Bank-financed part of the Agriculture Component, at least 50 percent of final&#13;
selected benefiting farmers must be either returning refugees or returning internally displaced persons.&#13;
58.    The following eligibility criteria will be applied by the municipalities in the target area to select&#13;
eligible farmers. Fulfillment of these criteria is based on self-declaration by the farmers on the survey&#13;
forms. Misrepresentation of the truth by farmers will lead to the cancellation of the credit through the&#13;
Agriculture Department, making the outstanding credit balance payable immediately. Mandatory criteria&#13;
must be fulfilled by all benefiting farmers. Other eligibility criteria should be fulfilled to the largest&#13;
extent possible. Livestock and farm equipment will only be provided to private, individual small-holder&#13;
farmers, not to State-owned farms or enterprises (more than 50 percent of capital in State ownership).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 15 of 23&#13;
Mandatory Criteria:&#13;
* Farmer-beneficiaries need to be experienced livestock producers and/or crop farmers and must have&#13;
suffered the loss of livestock/ a tractor due to the war.&#13;
*  Benefiting farmers must have legal title or a written user right to the farm land and farm buildings.&#13;
* For livestock, benefiting farmers must have adequate shelter and access to a land area that allows the&#13;
animals to be supported.&#13;
* For tractors, benefiting farmers must have adequate servicing and storage conditions for the&#13;
equipment and, in the case of two-axle tractors, own a minimum of 10 hectares of land.&#13;
*  At the time of signing the supply and credit agreement, the benefiting fann family household&#13;
disposes of no more than: (i) DEM 10,000 equivalent of total assets other than the farm land and&#13;
buildings, and (ii) DEM 500 equivalent of household cash income per month.&#13;
Other Elizibilitv Criteria:&#13;
* Farmers should demonstrate their intention to rebuild and operate the farm by undertaking repairs to&#13;
farm buildings and facilities and restarting agricultural activities.&#13;
* Farmers should have access to adequate marketing facilities (farmer/cooperative markets, cooperative&#13;
processing centers, agro-processing enterprises, etc.).&#13;
* For livestock, farmers should have access to veterinarian support and artificial insemination services.&#13;
* For tractors, farmers should be able to hire or purchase some tractor implements and buy spare parts&#13;
through service centers within the local area.&#13;
Component Implementation&#13;
59.   To allow  for swift implementation of this emergency-type operation, procedures for&#13;
implementation are being kept highly straightforward.  The two main component activities are&#13;
procurement and distribution of livestock and farm machinery. In order to secure early arrival and&#13;
expedient distribution of procured items, a detailed implementation schedule has been developed for this&#13;
component and is attached. The component is designed to allow for substantial completion of all&#13;
activities relating to procurement and distribution within a 12-15 month time frame.&#13;
60.   Recruitment of local staff and the setting up of the Agriculture Department has been initiated and&#13;
would be finalized by the time of Credit approval by the Bank. In order to ensure an early start of&#13;
activities, two of the intemational staff positions have already been filled through altemative interim&#13;
funding arrangements such as donor trust funds. Identification of the potential farmer-beneficiaries,&#13;
following the agreed set of criteria, has also been initiated. This will start through the municipal farm&#13;
damage surveys in the target area.&#13;
61.   For livestock and farm machinery, preparation of tender documents is underway through the&#13;
expatriate livestock and mechanization advisors to the Agriculture Department, to be supported by the&#13;
overall expatriate procurement manager assigned to the PCU as of March 1997. Tender documents will&#13;
provide for delivery of livestock to pre-determined quarantine areas, and for farm equipment to local&#13;
service stations and reception areas. Livestock to be imported would be inspected and selected in the&#13;
country of origin by a team including representatives of Agriculture Department and the MAFWR as well&#13;
as the expatriate livestock advisor. Each benefiting farmer will receive a limited number of livestock, not&#13;
exceeding three heads per farm family. Tractor sets are limited to one per farm family. Provision of&#13;
livestock and tractors to the same family would be an exceptional case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 16 of 23&#13;
Cost Recovery and Onlending Arrangements&#13;
62.    All farmers are reqnired to enter into supply and credit agreements with the Agricultural&#13;
Department of the PCU, representing the RS government. The maturity of the credits are as follows: for&#13;
livestock, five year maturity including one year grace; for farm equipment, eight year maturity including&#13;
two years of grace. The annual credit interest rate would be determined by the RS govermment, but will&#13;
not be below DEM-Libor plus 3 percent per year. The interest rate will be fixed during the life of the&#13;
credit, and credit repayments will be expressed in annuities. Credit repayments by farmers would be&#13;
through local credit institutions, selected based on their fees and quality of service in handling accounts&#13;
for the RS government. An alternative arrangement for collection of farmer credits would be the use of&#13;
local NGOs associated with the Local Initiatives Project, in implementation in RS since early 1997. The&#13;
credit institution or NGO(s) collecting the credits will provide at least quarterly farm credit repayment&#13;
statistics to the RS govemment and the financing donors.&#13;
63.    The supply and credit agreements will set out: (i) the value of the goods supplied, based on the&#13;
import value, expressed in convertible currency; (ii) the total value of the supply and credit agreement,&#13;
not to exceed DEM 100,000 equivalent per farm family and agreement; (iii) the interest rate and maturity&#13;
along with the detailed credit repayment schedule; (iv) the requirement for the borrower to provide&#13;
guarantees in the form of three co-signatures; (v) detailed credit repayment arrangements through local&#13;
credit institutions or NGOs; (vi) requirements for adequate servicing and storage of items, including the&#13;
need to maintain service and performance records; (vii) the obligation to purchase insurance against loss&#13;
and damage to the livestock and/or the tractor; and (viii) a clause stating that any misrepresentation of the&#13;
truth by farmers, as well as the sale of the livestock or tractor, will lead to the cancellation of the credit,&#13;
making the outstanding credit balance payable immediately.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
64.    The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 8, the procurement plan for&#13;
the Agriculture Component is attached. In case of parallel financing by other donors, the applicable&#13;
procurement procedures of the respective financiers would be used.&#13;
65.    The Bank will finance one LIB package of two-axle tractors, valued at US$ 0.9 million. The list&#13;
of LIB bidders invited to provide offers will be based on the expressions of interest received in response&#13;
to the General Procurement Notice as well as other sources. The list will be as broad as possible.&#13;
Geographical distribution will be considered to the maximum extent possible. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents will be used. The LIB contract will require prior approval of the Bank relating to the&#13;
list of suppliers and technical specifications.&#13;
66.    The Bank will also finance US$ 0.1 million of consultant services and services of local&#13;
agricultural service providers. The services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines which&#13;
shall include both competition and sole sourcing. Sole sourcing of services will need to be justified in&#13;
each case. Such justification may be the timing constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and lack of&#13;
candidates given the post-conflict situation in RS. No assignments have been pre-identified for sole&#13;
sourcing. Any sole sourcing during implementation will be subject to the Bank's approval. Follow-up&#13;
assignments will be permissible to the extent that this will be indicated in the initial Terms of Reference.&#13;
67.    As stated above, from the experience gained of the parallel project in the Federation of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina, it is not expected that procurement agents would need to be engaged. The Agricultural&#13;
Department of the Project Coordination Unit, assisted by qualified and experienced expatriate advisors, is&#13;
expected to be able to carry out procurement of the LIB equipment contract and of consultant service&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
Page 17 of 23&#13;
contracts quickly and efficiently. Post review of procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly&#13;
basis by Bank supervision missions, assisted by the Procurement Specialist in the Bank's Resident&#13;
Mission in Sarajevo. Furthermore, post review monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through&#13;
quarterly reporting, which will be part of the regular quarterly progress reports under the overall project.&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
68.    The disbursement plan is given in Tables 9 and 10. Disbursements are expected to be completed&#13;
within a period of two years from the date of effectiveness. The Bank Credit would finance the&#13;
categories of expenditures outlined in Table 1 1. Further details on disbursement procedures, including&#13;
use of the Special Account and of Statements of Expenditures, are provided in the main text of the&#13;
overall project.&#13;

The above accelerated schematic implementation schedule is based on the experiences gained during the parallel 1996 project&#13;
carried out in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Actual implementation dates will depend on the date of Credit&#13;
effectiveness, availability of donor cofinancing, and seasonal conditions (especially for livestock deliveries).&#13;
Component supervision through the World Bank would be carried on a continuous basis through staff of the Resident Mission&#13;
in Sarajevo.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Reconstruction Assistance Project&#13;
HOUSING COMPONENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Housing Sector in RS&#13;
1.    The Republika Srpska's (RS) prewar population of 1.3 million was predominantly rural with&#13;
only 20 percent living in urban areas. The majority of urban dwellers were located in Banja Luka which&#13;
was the second largest city in the Bosnia Herzegovina (BH) in 1991. Overall, the population was well&#13;
housed with private housing representing about 80 percent of the stock. Urban areas had a mix of both&#13;
public and private housing. Public housing in the form of multi-family medium and high-rise brick or&#13;
prefabricated panel housing was concentrated in the largest towns cf RS (Banja Luka, Brcko, Doboj,&#13;
Prijedor) where it accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the housing stock.&#13;
2.    Public housing was funded through a salary tax, and public apartment houses were built by large&#13;
public construction firms on behalf of socially-owned enterprises as well as social and public institutions&#13;
which then allocated units for rental to their employees. Tenure in public hoising units bestowed many&#13;
of the benefits of full ownership including inheritance of the unit by family members living in the unit.&#13;
Management of this stock of housing was generally delegated to Municipal Housing Maintenance and&#13;
Management Enterprises which were responsible for rent collection, maintenance and management and&#13;
acted as an agent of the Housing Fund which represented the owners of the units.&#13;
War-related Damage and Current Situation&#13;
3.    Housing conditions have deteriorated greatly due to war damage and massive displacement of the&#13;
population. An estimated 24 percent of the housing in RS has been damageu and about five percent&#13;
destroyed.' The value of the damage to the housing stock is estimated at around US$ I billion. About 27 of&#13;
the 45 RS municipalities have experienced some forrn of damage to their housing stock, while others have been&#13;
untouched.&#13;
4.     The heaviest damage is concentrated in a few municipalities, such as Derventa, Sipovo, Modrica,&#13;
Mrkonjic Grad, and Brcko. located in the norlthem and westem part of RS. However, pressures on the housing&#13;
stock are not limited to war damage. Accommodation in cities that were largely untouched by the war (for&#13;
example Banja Luka and Visegrad) is in short supply due to the influx of displaced persons. Some households&#13;
are living in units damaged by shells, while others have had to be housed either with host families or in vacated&#13;
private and social housing, and about 10,000 people remain in crowded collective centers. Most of the larger&#13;
RS municipalities have established procedures for allocating vacated units to displaced families or placing them&#13;
with host families, giving preference to finding accommodation for people in collective centers.&#13;
5.    War damage to housing has been exacerbated by collateral damage caused by weather conditions, lack&#13;
of maitenance and the deterioration of infrastructure installations and connections to networks. Some vacated&#13;
houses have been deliberately bumed and others have been subject to looting of all windows, doors, intemal&#13;
fixtures and roof tiles resulting in a rapid deterioration of the units in the harsh winter conditions.&#13;
Damage estimates for the Federation are 50 percent of the stock, with an additional six percent destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 2 of 24&#13;
6.    Complicating the issue of addressing housing needs are the dramatic changes in the geographic&#13;
distribution of the population. The war has resulted in an exodus of refugees to other countries, internal&#13;
population shifts within RS, and an influx of people from the Kraijna region in Croatia as well as from areas&#13;
within the Federation. While there has been a massive exodus of Croats and Bosniacs from RS, the current&#13;
population is estimated to be not much below the pre-war level of 1.3 million inhabitants. About 30 percent of&#13;
the current population represents displaced families fron the Federation, Croatia and areas damaged within RS.&#13;
The large number of displaced people in many of the larger towns has led to crowding in available&#13;
accommodations vacated by other groups, or crowding with resident host families. Movement of the displaced&#13;
population back to their own homes, during 1996, has generally been among those who are intemally displaced&#13;
from municipalities within the RS.&#13;
Reconstruction Achievements in 1996&#13;
7.    Efforts at reconstruction of housing in RS during 1996 have been fairly limited. Donor activities&#13;
have come primarily through UNHCR in the form of materials distribution for the repair of about 2,700&#13;
units concentrated in the Pale and Banja Luka regions. UNHCR's Target Area Initiative, which is&#13;
intended to facilitate the return and reintegration of refugees and displaced persons, covers a few&#13;
municipalities in RS for a total of about 9,000 housing units in the Sipovo, Ribnik and Bratunac&#13;
municipalities. The target area initiative is intended to focus on towns where lack of infrastructure and&#13;
housing, rather than political or security concems, represents the main deterrent to the return of displaced&#13;
people or the repatriation of refugees. The objective is to focus donor efforts on a concerted effort to&#13;
rehabilitate housing as well as social and physical infrastructure in selected municipalities where&#13;
UNHCR has estimated a particular potential for return of displaced persons. This approach does not and&#13;
is not intended to address the needs for return of displaced people and refugees whose homes are in areas&#13;
where they would constitute a minority.&#13;
8.    In addition to UNHCR, selected NGOs supported by bilateral donors have assisted with repair of&#13;
private houses in heavily damaged RS towns such as Modrica and Derventa. Some municipalities have&#13;
undertaken repairs of roofs in lightly damaged public housing to accommodate displaced households and&#13;
preserve this stock. In very few instances, municipalities have initiated construction of a limited number&#13;
of new housing to accommodate displaced persons, using donated materials and the labor of displaced&#13;
population groups. Moreover, displaced groups are encouraged to participate in the repair of the units&#13;
they occupy. Surveys of housing damage in RS have been completed by IMG in December of 1996.&#13;
Furthermore, the RS Ministry of Urbanism, Housing and Construction has prepared its own survey of&#13;
public housing. The latter survey indicates that a total of US$ 70 million in urgent investments is needed&#13;
to repair public housing in 27 war-affected municipalities of RS.&#13;
Issues for Future Reconstruction&#13;
9.    The construction industry in RS relied primarily on large companies of the public sector along&#13;
with medium size private contractors working in large urban areas such as Banja Luka. There were also a&#13;
limited number of small companies building individual private housing or undertaking repairs and&#13;
subcontracting. Prior to the war, contractors based in former Yugoslavia were pre-eminent in the&#13;
construction sector, both on domestic and external markets. In RS, between 10 to 15 of the public&#13;
construction companies are expected to remain state-owned in the medium term while the remainder of&#13;
construction firms is likely to be privatized. Most companies are considerably reduced in size compared&#13;
with pre-war levels. However, contractor capability is not considered to be a problem and competition&#13;
between private and public companies should lead to greater efficiency and improved performance.&#13;
Materials are either locally available or are being imported from FRY (see the attachment for more&#13;
details). The engineering capacity for detailed housing damage and cost assessments in local, municipal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 3 of 24&#13;
technical departments is uneven. However, as noted previously, some capacity exists as municipalities&#13;
have undertaken repairs to lightly damaged housing.&#13;
10.    The level of damage to public apartment buildings in RS is generally below 40 percent (damage&#13;
categories A and B). Cost of repairs for the most prevalent levels of damage should remain within the&#13;
cost target for equivalent repairs carried out in the Federation during 1996 which range between US$&#13;
2,000 and US$ 2,500 per flat. However, certain RS municipalities, most notably Derventa, suffered a&#13;
higher level of damage which needs to be addressed by donors if living conditions are to improve in these&#13;
areas. In contrast, many of the lightly damaged buildings have been repaired, or at least efforts have been&#13;
made to salvage the roofs in order to preserve the buildings. When donors target the higher categories of&#13;
housing damage (over 40 percent) for repairs to roofs and other external installations, buildings should&#13;
only be selected after a structural inspection and an assessment of the cost of rehabilitating internal units.&#13;
Preliminary estimates of repair costs in selected RS municipalities are presented in Table 1.&#13;

Financial Issues&#13;
11.    Regarding cost recovery, the majority of municipalities that suffered extensive damage have not&#13;
collected rents for the last four years from either legal tenants or the displaced people who have been&#13;
given temporary occupancy rights. Other municipalities with minimal or no war damage are charging&#13;
reduced rental rates, and collection levels are low due to lack of household income. Achieving full cost&#13;
recovery, or even prewar rental levels, will take time. However, efforts must be initiated as carly as&#13;
possible to introduce some element of cost recovery in housing repair initiatives for both public and&#13;
private housing. This will allow for more sustainable levels of investment and would help increase the&#13;
efficiency in the use of scarce donor resources. Repairs to public housing need to be linked to an increase&#13;
of per-flat rental charges by an amount equivalent to recover the cost of repairs over time.&#13;
12.    For private housing repairs financed by other donors, even if financed out of bilateral grants, the&#13;
same principle of cost recovery should apply. As the administrative capacity of both Entity governments&#13;
increases and as the level of information on demand and beneficiary characteristics improves, it will&#13;
become possible to establish a system that would combine targeted housing grants with commercial loans&#13;
at market interest rates, based on house-owners' ability to pay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 4 of 24&#13;
Institutional Issues&#13;
13.   The Ministry of Urbanism, Housing and Construction (MUHC) of RS is the institution in charge&#13;
of the housing sector. In addition, during the war period, other ministries and the municipalities have&#13;
assumed specific roles in repair of housing and allocation of units to displaced persons. The MUHC&#13;
offices are split between Pale and Banja Luka, with the majority of staff located at the latter location,&#13;
while some additional staff is represented in other larger RS municipalities. The Ministry is responsible&#13;
for urban planning, housing, the construction and building industry as well as preparation and&#13;
presentation of legislation relating to housing, urban planning and the construction industry. It appears&#13;
thinly staffed, and its institutional capacity and experience for implementing major housing repair&#13;
programs is limited.&#13;
Legal Issues&#13;
14.   The legal framework in RS governing property rights and pre-war rights of legal tenants has been&#13;
complicated due to the passage of legislation seeking to facilitate the housing of displaced persons in&#13;
vacant units. A Law on the Use of Abandoned Properties was passed in RS in March of 1996. This law&#13;
makes it possible for municipalities, through housing or refugee commissions, to allocate vacated private&#13;
and public dwelling units to displaced persons, assigning them temporary occupancy rights. While it&#13;
recognizes the right of property owners to reclaim their units, it is silent on the right of legal tenants to&#13;
reclaim their dwellings. This law is considered to be contrary to the provisions of Annex 7 of the Dayton&#13;
Peace Agreement as it essentially interferes with the right of owners and occupants to reclaim their units.&#13;
The RS authorities recognize the need to change this legislation so as to conform to the Dayton&#13;
provisions and in order to follow respective instructions by the Office of the High Representative&#13;
regarding this law. A more detailed discussion of legal housing issues is attached.&#13;
15.   The authority of locally created commissions on refugees to allocate housing units (in some&#13;
municipalities all abandoned property has been turned over to local refugee commissions) could&#13;
complicate the existing legal framework regarding how rents are set and collected, and could confuse the&#13;
picture with respect to the rights of the owners of the units (the enterprises) to allocate and sell these&#13;
units. It is, therefore, necessary to establish, at the outset of donor-financed public housing repair&#13;
programs, the roles and responsibilities regarding setting of rental rates and collection of rental charges at&#13;
the municipal level.&#13;
Short- and Medium Term Objectives&#13;
16.   Repair of housing, if combined with repair of community infrastructure and with employment&#13;
generation, will facilitate the return of the displaced and refugees to their homes in areas where physical&#13;
and economic conditions are the primary constraints to return. Moreover, repair of war-damaged housing&#13;
is an essential precondition to medium-term recovery and long-term reform of the housing sector, given&#13;
the extent of damage to the stock. While extemal resources that can be mobilized will always fall short&#13;
of what is required to repair most damage, donor-financed programs can jump-start the process of repairs.&#13;
As the economy recovers and households have the means to undertake repairs on their own, general&#13;
repair programs will become less needed, and more reliance will be placed on targeted assistance for the&#13;
neediest population segments. Given the large number of damaged units and the uncertainty as to the&#13;
return of the displaced and refugees, new housing construction does not seem warranted at this juncture.&#13;
17.   The following considerations for repair programs applied during 1996 remain valid for 1997,&#13;
especially for RS where little donor-financed repairs have taken place so far:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 5 of 24&#13;
* Support must aim at an immediate increase in the amount of the useable housing stock in areas where&#13;
damage is largest and where needs of the displaced are highest.&#13;
* Given limited resources, returns on invested funds need to be particularly high. Hence, units selected&#13;
should require limited works; areas selected need to offer real potential for resuming economic&#13;
activity and attracting other infrastructure repairs; and project management must be efficient.&#13;
* Cost recovery should be introduced early on, both for public and private housing repairs, and&#13;
irrespective of whether repairs are grant-financed or credit-financed by the donors.&#13;
18.   Donors should continue to assist the authorities to carry out repair programs for both public and&#13;
private housing. Repairs to public housing offer several advantages: (i) they bypass potential property&#13;
rights issues and, hence, can be launched quickly; (ii) due to low per-flat costs they benefit a large&#13;
number of individuals; and (iii) they allow for easy introduction of cost recovery through rental charges.&#13;
Focusing housing repairs on the common elements in public apartment buildings allows to deal with that&#13;
type of damage which is most difficult to address by individual occupants, and the repair of which is an&#13;
essential precondition for subsequent repairs to individual units. Clearly, in rural areas, only repairs to&#13;
private housing will address housing needs since public housing is concentrated in the cities.&#13;
19.   In the short term, there is an important role for the Entity Govenmients to manage emergency&#13;
housing repairs and in setting direction for donor assistance programs, especially so as to enable the&#13;
return of refugees and displaced persons. Over the medium and long term, however, recovery of the&#13;
housing sector will require that attention be given by the Entity Governments to manage the transition&#13;
from the supply-driven model of the past towards market-oriented housing policies. A policy and&#13;
regulatory framework will be needed that encourages private sector investment and housing market&#13;
development. Prior to the war, Bosnia's private sector demonstrated a considerable capacity to construct&#13;
and fund new housing stock. There is every reason to expect that the private sector will resume this role&#13;
even more vigorously, within an adequate enabling policy framework, as economic recovery progresses.&#13;
To allow this to happen, several policy areas will require attention: establishment of clear and enforceable&#13;
property rights; privatization of housing stock; introduction of rental charges that permit to cover&#13;
building maintenance and investments; introduction of competition in the management and maintenance&#13;
of public housing; development of housing finance as part of overall financial sector reforms;&#13;
privatization of the construction industry; and streamlining of regulations relating to land use as well as&#13;
infrastructure and housing development so as to ensure a more flexible supply response by the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
20.   The Bank is committed to assist both Entities of BH, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
and RS, to address the most urgent housing reconstruction needs through emergency-type support. For&#13;
the Federation, in July 1996, the Bank has a approved a US$ 15 million Credit for an Emergency&#13;
Housing Repair Project (FY97). Numerous other donor partners have joined the Bank to support this&#13;
project, including the European Union and the governments of Saudi Arabia, Italy, Germany and the&#13;
Netherlands. Through that project the Bank is assisting the Federation authorities to carry out repairs to&#13;
public apartment buildings containing some 17,000 flats, with about 60 percent of repairs completed as&#13;
of end-1996. The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project is the equivalent emergency project&#13;
designed to assist the RS authorities in a similar manner.&#13;
21.   The Bank's support to Bosnia's housing sector is part of the agreed international reconstruction&#13;
program for housing of BH of about US$ 700 million, to be implemented over three to four years, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 6 of 24&#13;
the Bank has helped to develop in a joint effort with the country and the donor community.2 The housing&#13;
sector prograrn aims to create conditions to enable the retum of refugees and the intemally displaced, and&#13;
to rapidly expand the non-usable housing stock for the entire population (see Table 2). Works are limited&#13;
initially to emergency repairs that will create minimum habitable standards, such as repairs to common&#13;
elements of the public housing stock. In a second stage, reconstruction of more heavily damaged private&#13;
and public housing units is being undertaken. A separate program element is focusing on the city of&#13;
Sarajevo where more than 50,000 units, half of the stock, were darnaged. The program is also aimed to&#13;
start addressing issues of financial, legal and institutional sustainability and establishing a policy&#13;
framework to ensure a long-term recovery of the housing sector.&#13;

Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
22.   Through the early start of the Emergency Housing Repair Project in the Federation of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, the Bank was able to assist the Federation to secure substantial donor cofinancing for&#13;
housing repairs. As of end-1996, nearly three Dollars of additional donor support were mobilized for&#13;
every Dollar provided by the Bank. It is expected that the Bank's presence and its oversight over project&#13;
implementation would also provide comfort to donors for supporting an emergency-type public housing&#13;
repair program in RS. In addition to raising donor funding, the Bank has assisted the Federation&#13;
Government to set up an efficient housing project implementation and sector planning unit which would&#13;
not exist in this form without the Bank's involvement; the same impact is expected for the project in RS.&#13;
Furthermore, the Bank is in a position to advise the Entity Governments on housing policy issues, based&#13;
on the Bank's recent involvement in a number of other post-conflict countries and former centrally-&#13;
planned economies. The Bank is also seen as an important member of the Housing Sector Task Force in&#13;
Sarajevo where donors and the Entity Governments meet regularly to exchange technical and policy-&#13;
related views.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/ IDA Experience&#13;
23.   There are a number of lessons leamed from the Emergency Housing Repair Project which is in&#13;
implementation in the Federation since the Summer of 1996, as well as from other housing prograrns&#13;
financed by donors in Bosnia during 1996. These have been incorporated into the proposed project and&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
* Contracting for integrated civil works, rather than merely providing building materials and relying on&#13;
residents' self-labor, has been an effective way of repairing housing stock on time and within cost.&#13;
2    See: "Bosnia and Herzegovina: The Priority Reconstruction Program", Vol. 3, Reconstruction Sector&#13;
Reports, made available for the Donor Information Meeting in Brussels, January 1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 7 of 24&#13;
* The local private construction industry is able to recover quickly from the war, importing materials&#13;
where necessary and mobilizing rapidly to carry out repair works that were procured competitively.&#13;
* Selection of units, assessment of damage, and oversight of repairs is best delegated to municipal&#13;
project offices, supported by skilled local consultants, while contract procurement and project&#13;
disbursement should be concentrated in a central project office.&#13;
* Actual demand for housing by the displaced and refugees should guide the funding allocation for&#13;
housing repairs. More active coordination with UNHCR and other competent agencies is needed.&#13;
* Housing repairs are to be integrated with other investments into the social and physical community&#13;
infrastructure. Given scarce resources, donor coordination is especially critical in this respect.&#13;
Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
24.   The Housing Component of the Reconstruction Assistance Project will complement the other&#13;
components of this project (agriculture, water and sanitation, and electric energy) by generating the&#13;
required shelter for retuming refugees and displaced persons. The joint Project Coordination Unit for all&#13;
four components will engage to target specific areas where two or more project components provide&#13;
benefits to the same population, thus aiming at an integrated area approach to economic reconstruction.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
25.   The primary objective of the Housing Component is to increase the quality and quantity of the&#13;
public housing stock in war-affected areas of RS. Resulting benefits are aimed at both the present&#13;
population in these areas and at refugees and displaced persons which intend to return to their&#13;
communities. The emergency reconstruction phase in RS calls for projects with fast, direct impact on the&#13;
ground; hence component design has been kept straightforward such as to allow for speedy&#13;
implementation.&#13;
26.   The secondary objectives of the Housing Component are as follows: (i) to initiate sustainable&#13;
sector recovery by introducing the principle of cost recovery; (ii) to help build up the institutional&#13;
capacity of the RS authorities for managing housing repair programs; and (iii) to support the local&#13;
economy and create employment through competitive procurement of labor-intensive housing repair&#13;
works.&#13;
Component Elements&#13;
27.   To support the above objectives, the Housing Component has two elements: (i) emergency&#13;
public housing repairs; and (ii) technical support.&#13;
Element 1: Emergency Public Housing Repairs&#13;
28.   This element would cover the repair of damage to common elements in multi-story non-system&#13;
built socially-owned apartment buildings, along with the cost of designs, management and supervision by&#13;
local consultants. About 36,000 publicly owned units are estimated to be damaged in urban areas&#13;
throughout RS. The Housing Component is designed to repair approximately 250 buildings containing&#13;
some 4,500 residential units. This represents some 12.5 percent of all damaged social apartnent units in&#13;
RS. The following five municipalities have been identified for inclusion under the Housing Component:&#13;
Derventa, Brcko, Modrica, Mrkonjic Grad, and Sipovo (see Table 3 for cost estimates).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 8 of 24&#13;
29.    The selection of municipalities has been carried out on the basis of two main criteria: (i) the&#13;
extent of physical war damage suffered by the public housing stock in each municipality; and (ii) the&#13;
expected demand by the present population and potential returnees for reconstructed housing facilities.&#13;
The latter is based on information provided by UNHCR and other competent organizations dealing with&#13;
issues of return of refugees and displaced persons. The physical municipality selection criteria can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
*  population size (in 1991) of more than 10,000 inhabitants&#13;
*  public housing stock represents more tharn 20 percent of total municipal housing stock&#13;
* share of damaged stock as percent of total municipal public housing stock is over 30 percent&#13;
* the majority of damaged public housing stock has less than 40 percent damage to external fabric&#13;
* municipalities agree to apply cost recovery for repair costs and to present a plan for full coverage of&#13;
operation and maintenance costs within five years (see further below)&#13;
30.    Further criteria applied for the selection of municipalities are the expected capacity at the local&#13;
level to prepare repair projects and supervise their implementation, and also the prospects for restoring&#13;
necessary local infrastructure such as heating where existing systems have broken down. Furthennore, in&#13;
the municipalities selected there are a variety of on-going or planned donor-financed reconstruction&#13;
programs, including repairs to schools, hospitals, roads and water systems, as well as projects aiming to&#13;
generate income and employment. Hence, the objective of an integrated community development&#13;
program has been addressed.&#13;

Note:  Cost estimates for works include costs of detailed damage assessments (I percent) and costs for&#13;
preparation of designs and works supervision (2.5 percent).&#13;
31.    Individual apartment buildings to be repaired would be selected according to the following&#13;
criteria which would aim to maximize the number of units that could be made habitable in each&#13;
municipality. The focus will be on damaged but structurally sound buildings so as to ensure that&#13;
preparation for and implementation of works can be completed rapidly and in a cost-effective manner:&#13;
*  Building owners are civilian enterprises or the municipality and no ownership disputes exist.&#13;
* The municipality can provide proof that it has appropriate authority from building owners to&#13;
undertake repairs and to implement cost recovery through an increase of rental charges.&#13;
*  Buildings fulfill the following physical criteria:&#13;
*  they are constructed to traditional designs and with traditional materials (no system-build)&#13;
* they have limited damage (not exceeding 40 percent) to their external envelope&#13;
* they are structurally sound&#13;
*  together they form part of, or constitute a community group&#13;
*  they have existing infrastructure services, or these services are about to be restored&#13;
*  they are located in areas cleared, or declared free of land-mines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 9 of 24&#13;
repairs to external building elements will result in a large number of useable units&#13;
32.   The repair works would restore common building elements and utilities. These works would&#13;
weather-proof the building envelope so as to prevent further deterioration and to facilitate repairs of the&#13;
interior of apartment units by tenants or through complementary donor-funded programs. Typical works&#13;
financed under this component element would include repair of damage to roofs, external walls,&#13;
windows, entrances, staircases, halls, corridors, and building utility systems, and are described in more&#13;
detail in the attachment. Works would be undertaken by contractors selected through competitive&#13;
bidding, as set out further below.&#13;
Element 2: Technical Support&#13;
33.   The project would finance technical support from an expatriate housing advisor. This support&#13;
would cover the organization, supervision of and training in: damage assessments, cost and quality&#13;
control, procurement activities, review  of municipality and building selection decisions, on-site&#13;
supervision of repair works, as well as support in adherence to accurate and timely reporting by local&#13;
project management. RS Government resources would be used to extend this expatriate technical support&#13;
beyond the planned period, if required. The project would also finance local consultants which will assist&#13;
the Housing Department in the Project Coordination Unit to carry out on-site quality control inspections,&#13;
in addition to the local supervision arrangements made for each contract. The operating costs of the staff&#13;
of the Housing Department itself are included in the Implementation Support Component of the overall&#13;
project.&#13;

Component Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
34.   The total estimated cost of the component is shown in Table 5. No physical contingencies for&#13;
works have been included, given that the exact number of buildings and units to benefit under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Paee 10 of 24&#13;
Housing Component is not pre-determined and will depend on the actual cost of repair contracts resulting&#13;
from detailed damage assessments and competitive bidding procedures. Price contingencies have not&#13;
been included given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Donor-financed&#13;
items under the international reconstruction program are tax-exempt in RS.&#13;
35.   Of the total component cost, the World Bank would finance US$ 5.7 million equivalent. 95&#13;
percent of the World Bank contribution would be allocated for repair works in the selected&#13;
municipalities, financing about one third of the total cost of planned repairs in each municipality. The&#13;
balance of Bank funding would finance technical support through local and expatriate advisors.&#13;
Additional financing of US$ 9.5 million equivalent is being sought from other donors (see financing plan&#13;
shown in Table 6). Given the fully modular nature of housing repairs, where repairs to one building are&#13;
independent of repairs to other buildings, the initial lack of donor financing would have no impact on the&#13;
timely start-up of Bank-financed repair works.&#13;

Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
36.   The Housing Component is designed to return to habitable standards some 250 buildings&#13;
containing an estimated 4,500 flats, or 12.5 percent of the total damaged public housing stock in RS.&#13;
The benefits of repairing war damaged buildings and contributing to the process of housing displaced&#13;
persons in their communities are obvious and represent in themselves a justification for the Housing&#13;
Component. However, there are tangible economic and financial benefits as well. Unless housing repairs&#13;
are carried out now, further rapid deterioration of the damaged units can be expected, endangering even&#13;
more the quality of housing. Eventually, after several years of no repairs, the damaged units will&#13;
deteriorate to a degree where full reconstruction would be required, estimated to cost on average about&#13;
US$ 30,000 per flat. The expected per-flat cost of the proposed buildings repair works of about US$&#13;
3,300 represents only 11 percent of the cost needed for complete reconstruction.&#13;
37.   Of the total proposed investment into repairs of US$ 15 million, about one third or US$5 million&#13;
would represent labor income for employed construction workers. Given the small expected average&#13;
contract size, local resources are likely to used extensively, offering small local contractors an&#13;
opportunity to re-start their businesses after the war. At a gross average monthly labor cost of about&#13;
DEM 300, the Housing Component could create as much as 25,000 person-months of temporary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;

construction labor over the implementation period. Labor and income generation will benefit the local&#13;
economy. The Housing Component would also contribute to revitalizing the local building materials&#13;
industry and support trade businesses. Finally, through introduction of cost recovery, the Component&#13;
will lay the ground for sustainable public housing maintenance and management beyond the immediate&#13;
reconstruction period. The Component will also create a readily available implementation vehicle for&#13;
other donors intending to support the RS authorities to rebuild the damaged public housing stock.&#13;
38.   There are two main Component risks, beyond the general danger of a resumption of hostilities&#13;
and possible delays in the economic revitalization of RS and BH as a whole. These risks relate to delays&#13;
in start-up and implementation and risks resulting from a shortfall of donor cofinancing for this&#13;
Component. Start-up may be delayed due to failure by the RS authorities to prepare repair projects in a&#13;
timely fashion. To reduce this risk, the procurement and sample contracting documentation used for the&#13;
parallel project in the Federation will be made available to the Housing Department in RS. Work on&#13;
detailed housing damage and cost assessment has started in early 1997 using available Japanese grant&#13;
financing. An experienced expatriate expert that helped start up the Federation project has already been&#13;
deployed to RS. 'he second risk of a continued component funding gap would reduce the envisaged&#13;
impact of the project. However, none of the works to be carried from available financing would depend&#13;
on mobilization of the full envisaged funding.  Funding for required technical assistance and&#13;
implementation support has been secured. The Bank will make every effort to mobilize additional donor&#13;
cofinancing, and experience from the parallel Federation housing project suggests that there are good&#13;
prospects in this respect.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
39.   The Reconstruction Assistance Project has been placed in environmental category B. The&#13;
Housing Component would have positive environmental impacts as a result of rehabilitating damaged&#13;
units where municipal infrastructure facilities are likely to exist or are in the process of being repaired;&#13;
where the reoccupation of property will result in the tending and cultivating of associated land; and where&#13;
otherwise buildings would stand empty to deteriorate through weathering or vandalism.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Component Organization and Implementation&#13;
40.   Given the limited implementation capacity and experience of the Ministry of Urbanism, Housing&#13;
and Construction (MUHC) of RS, a Housing Department for implementation of the Housing Component&#13;
of the proposed project will be established within the Project Coordination Unit in the Ministry of&#13;
Finance in Banja Luka. Staff of this Housing Department will be seconded from the MUHC or recruited&#13;
from outside of the Government. This proposed structure of creating a dedicated project unit, supported&#13;
by selected local staff in the municipalities, has proven effective in managing the implementation of the&#13;
Emergency Housing Repair Project in the Federation during 1996. The Housing Department will be&#13;
headed by a Departnent Director who will report to the General Director of the Project Coordination&#13;
Unit. In addition to the expatriate housing advisor, the Housing Department Director will have at least&#13;
seven local staff: a project accounts officer, an accounts database technician, a technical manager, one&#13;
(or several) project manager(s), and two support staff. The staff and operational costs of the Housing&#13;
Department are included in the Implementation Support Component of the overall project. The Housing&#13;
Department will initially be operating for an 18 month period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 12 of 24&#13;
41.   The Housing Department will be responsible for all aspects of implementation of the Housing&#13;
Component, except for aspects of Credit disbursements and payments to suppliers which will be handled&#13;
by the PCU Financial Controller. Specifically, Lie Housing Department will: enter into subsidiary&#13;
implementation agreements with municipalities, as described below; select detailed project sites and&#13;
buildings; contract out and review detailed damage assessments of buildings; contract out and review&#13;
final designs and tender specifications, prepare bidding documents, and carry out tenders; enter into&#13;
contracts with building contractors and local consultants; supervise contracted works and advise the PCU&#13;
Financial Controller on progress payments to be made to contractors; and carry out reporting&#13;
requirements. More details on the staffing and responsibilities of the Housing Department are attached.&#13;
42.   Many of the institutions that existed to fund, manage and maintain social housing and collect&#13;
rents are now defunct in most cities. Some towns are trying to reconstitute these institutions but it is&#13;
unclear how much emphasis will be given to this task since there is a presumption that social housing&#13;
will be privatized and that these functions could be eventually provided by private contractors. In such&#13;
instances the municipalities themselves have taken over the function of organizing repairs. Therefore, the&#13;
Housing Department will assess municipal capacity early on, both regarding the technical departnents of&#13;
municipalities as well as conceming the maintenance and management enterprises of municipalities&#13;
where these still exist. The Housing Department will put in place local municipal project units that&#13;
prepare projects and monitor construction, with reliance on contract staff as necessary. These units,&#13;
reporting to the Housing Department, would work with municipalities on day-to-day management of&#13;
local repair projects according to the procedures established for the Component. The local consultants&#13;
working with the municipalities would select the buildings to be repaired; undertake damage&#13;
assessments; define work specifications; monitor construction progress; and certify completion of works&#13;
for payment.&#13;
43.   A detailed Component implementation schedule has been developed and is attached. The&#13;
Component is designed to allow for completion of all repair activities over an 18-month time frame. To&#13;
achieve this goal, early preparation of damage and cost assessments is needed. Using available donor&#13;
grant financing, the first set of assessments has been brought under way. Recruitment of local staff and&#13;
the setting up of the Housing Department is at an advanced stage and would be finalized prior to Credit&#13;
approval by the Bank. The international housing advisor position has been filled in February 1997&#13;
through funding from donor trust funds.&#13;
Cost Recovery and Onlending Arrangements&#13;
44.   IDA funds will be on-lent from the State of BH to RS. The RS Ministry of Finance will make&#13;
these funds available to the Project Coordination Unit. Subsequently, the Project Coordination Unit,&#13;
represented by its Housing Department, will enter into subsidiary implementation agreements with each&#13;
benefiting municipality. Subsidiary implementation agreements will specify the scope and value of&#13;
repairs to be financed, along with the repayment terms and conditions which will depend on the cost&#13;
recovery terms imposed on tenants. Given the emergency nature of the project and the difficult income&#13;
situation of both households and municipalities in RS, concessionary financing of repair works is&#13;
justified. The urgency of restoring a vital social and economic asset, housing, destroyed by force majeure&#13;
argues for a gradual introduction of cost recovery.&#13;
45.   To introduce cost recovery through payments by tenants, incremental rental charges would be&#13;
calculated so as to recover repair costs over no more than 30 years, including 5 years of grace, at no less&#13;
than 1.75 percent interest per annum. These terms would be somewhat less favorable than IDA terms,&#13;
but are considered to be affordable so that residents can recover from the economic impact of the war and&#13;
start regular rental payments. Monthly rental increases would be around US$ 14 equivalent per flat after&#13;
the grace period, assuming average repair costs of about US$ 3,300 per flat. As the repairs would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 13 of 24&#13;
prevent further deterioration of common systems and facilities, they should lower overall maintenance&#13;
expenditures in the immediate term. Hence, before financing of repair works will start, each benefiting&#13;
municipality will be required to enter into a subsidiary implementation agreement with the Housing&#13;
Department of the PCU, covering the applicable repayment terms and setting out the increase of future&#13;
rental charges along the lines specified above. Incremental rents collected by the municipalities will be&#13;
transferred to an account of the Ministry of Finance of RS.&#13;
46.    Beyond the need to recover the investment cost of repairs under the Housing Component, it wili&#13;
be necessary for municipalities to start recovering recurrent costs of managing the public housing stock.&#13;
Therefore, prior to the financing of repairs, municipalities targeted under the project will also be required&#13;
to provide a plan and time schedule for reinstating rental rates that allow full coverage of operation and&#13;
maintenance costs within a five year period, along with a plan for maintenance of elements that have&#13;
been repaired through the project.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
47.    The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 7, an indicative procurement&#13;
plan for the Housing Component is attached. In case of parallel financing by other donors, the applicable&#13;
procurement procedures of the respective financiers would be used.&#13;

a Figures in parenthesis represent Bank financing.&#13;
b The Bank would finance housing repair works based on Simplified National Competitive Bidding procedures. Individual&#13;
repair contracts would in most cases not exceed US$ 400,000 in value. The first ten works contracts and any contract&#13;
exceeding US$ 400,000 equivalent would require prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
c Consultant services consist of a number of individual consultants. Their services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines using competitive procedures.&#13;
48.    The Bank will finance about 25 civil works contracts for public sector housing repairs which will&#13;
be procured on the basis of Simplified National Competitive Bidding procedures (SNCB). The average&#13;
contract size is estimated at US$ 230,000, and contracts are in most cases not expected to exceed US$&#13;
400,000. The total value of Bank-financed works is US$ 5.5 million. Works contracts will be lump-&#13;
sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three pre-qualified&#13;
contractors. Bid invitations shall provide a detailed description of the works, including technical&#13;
specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

relevant designs and drawings where applicable. Prior approval by the Bank will be required of the first&#13;
ten contracts for public sector housing repairs and any contracts exceeding a value of US$ 400,000&#13;
equivalent. Prior to the initiation of any procurement action, the Housing Department will provide the&#13;
Bank with a procurement plan detailing the number of contracts to be procured, bid invitation dates, as&#13;
well as expected start and end dates for each contract.&#13;
49.   A streamlined pre-qualification of contractors will be carried out. For this purpose, a short notice&#13;
will be published in the press and announcements will be made in each municipality inviting local and&#13;
national, private and state-owned contracting firms to express their interest in different levels of contract&#13;
values. Pre-qualification criteria will be subject to prior approval by the Bank. Interested bidders shall&#13;
provide information using standard forms issued by the Housing Department and shall meet the&#13;
following minimum qualifying criteria:&#13;
*  demonstrated capacity as a contractor to successfully complete works in an amount up to the&#13;
aggregate contract value specified&#13;
.  demonstrated experience as a contractor in the construction of similar works of nature and&#13;
complexity to the proposed works&#13;
-  demonstrated ability to provide all essential workers for completion of the works specified in the bid&#13;
50.   Pre-qualification will result in a listing of contractors with individual established contract limits.&#13;
State-owned construction enterprises must meet the Bank's eligibility criteria of autonomous legal status&#13;
and absence of govenmment subsidies of their operations. Contractors will be invited to submit bids for&#13;
repair contracts up to their established upper contracting limit. Along with the signature of works&#13;
contracts, the Housing Department will enter into supervision contracts with local independent&#13;
consultants. These consultants will typically be part of the technical department of the municipality or&#13;
belong to the municipal housing maintenance and management enterprise. The Housing Department will&#13;
train these local consultants as needed.&#13;
51.   In addition to repair works, the Bank will also finance US$ 0.2 million of consultant services&#13;
which will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines. No assignments have been pre-identified for&#13;
sole sourcing which would require prior Bank approval. Follow-up assignments will be permissible to&#13;
the extent that this will be indicated in the initial Terms of Reference.&#13;
52.   From the experience gained of the parallel project in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
it is not expected that procurement agents would need to be engaged. The Housing Department of the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit, assisted by a qualified and experienced expatriate advisor, is expected to be&#13;
able to carry out procurement of works contracts quickly and efficiently. Sample documentation&#13;
available from the Federation project should facilitate the procurement task in RS. Post review of&#13;
procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly basis by Bank supervision missions. The Bank's&#13;
Procurement Specialist in the Resident Mission in Sarajevo will assist with prior review of the first 10&#13;
works contracts. Furthermore, monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through quarterly reporting,&#13;
which will be part of the regular quarterly progress reports under the overall project.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
53.   The disbursement plan is given in Tables 8 and 9. Disbursements are expected to be completed&#13;
within a period of less than three years from the date of effectiveness. The Bank Credit would finance&#13;
the categories of expenditures outlined in Table 10. Further details on disbursement procedures,&#13;
including use of the Special Account and of Statements of Expenditures, are provided in the main text of&#13;
the overall project.&#13;

Housing Component of the project. Details on these accounts, as well as on auditing and supervision&#13;
procedures to be followed, are applicable to aUl project components and are therefore set out in the main&#13;
text of the overall project documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;

55.   Given the need for expedited implementation, the Housing Component would be supervised&#13;
continuously by Bank staff based in the Resident Mission in Sarajevo, with fornal evaluation of progress&#13;
every three months after effectiveness. The review would assess the need for any adjustments, based on&#13;
implementation experience to date.&#13;
56.   The Housing Department will provide to PCU management quarterly inputs for progress reports&#13;
showing the status of implementation of the Housing Component, including summary information on&#13;
procurement contracts, in a format acceptable to the Bank. Specific reporting elements for the Housing&#13;
Component include the following project information and performance monitoring indicators:&#13;
An updated Component Procurement Plan, detailing the names of municipalities included under the&#13;
Component, number of public apartment buildings, number of flats per building (of which: not&#13;
habitable prior to the start of works), name of owner of each building, description of building&#13;
damage, type and cost of works envisaged, value of design and supervision contracts&#13;
* Procurement information for civil works contracts: number of contracts let, all applicable contract&#13;
procurement dates (invitation to quote, evaluation, award, signature, start of works, current works&#13;
progress, expected works completion), progress payments made to date, name of contractors&#13;
*  Photographs of every building prior to the start of works and after works completion&#13;
e  Copies of the subsidiary implementation agreements entered into with each municipality, detailing&#13;
repayment modalities and cost recovery&#13;
&#149;  Information on current rental charges for every building and municipality under the Component&#13;
*  Assessment of the labor impact caused by civil works financed and carried out to date&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
57.   During negotiations, the following agreements were reached regarding the Housing Component:&#13;
*  Agreement on the component area: the RS municipalities of Derventa, Brcko, Modrica, Mrkonjic&#13;
Grad, and Sipovo&#13;
*  Agreement on the limitation of the type of repair works to be financed, as set out in the attachment&#13;
&#149;  Agreement on the terms and conditions of the subsidiary implementation agreements to be entered&#13;
into between the Housing Department and each municipality: repayment by the municipalities of the&#13;
value of repairs through increase of rental charges for the buildings concerned; the increase in rents&#13;
will lead to the recovery of repair costs over no more than 30 years, including 5 years of grace, at no&#13;
less than 1.75 percent interest per annum&#13;
&#149;  Agreement that municipalities are to provide a plan and time schedule, prior to the start of works, for&#13;
reinstating rental rates that would allow full coverage of operation and maintenance costs within a&#13;
five year period, along with a plan for maintenance of elements repaired under the Component&#13;
.  Agreement on the staffing and maintenance of the Housing Department within the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit for the project&#13;

The sequence of activities is based on the experiences gained during the housing repair project carried out in the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996. Actual dates for implementation will depend on the effectiveness of the IDA credit and&#13;
availability of donor cofinancing.&#13;
Reporting by the HD would continue on a quarterly basis until the last contract financed has been fully implemented and all&#13;
Credit funds have been disbursed.&#13;
Component supervision through the World Bank would be carried on a continuous basis through staff of the Resident Mission&#13;

Attachment 3: Availability of Labor and Building Materials in RS&#13;
1.     In RS, construction labor and building materials are generally available. Any significant increase&#13;
in the demand for labor and materials is not expected to result in constraints.&#13;
Labor&#13;
2.     The labor required to carry out repairs under the Housing Component is expected to be readily&#13;
available locally in RS. Inquiries made in the municipalities of Rogatica, Visegrad, Derventa, Modrica,&#13;
Brcko and Doboj revealed that there is still significant reliance on state-owned construction companies.&#13;
There are about 15 such companies operating in RS, some quoted to employ about 100 workers. Small&#13;
private contractors exist as well but appear to be rather unevenly distributed across the RS territory. Pre-&#13;
qualified firms from both groups will be invited to bid, and contractors will be registered with the&#13;
Ministiy of Urbanism, Housing and Construction. There is also a large idle pool of building workers that&#13;
could be used. Each of the above municipalities has already organized some limited repair works,&#13;
generally to a satisfactory standard.&#13;
Materials&#13;
3.     Before the war, former Yugoslavia was pre-eminent in international contracting and also&#13;
maintained a strong national construction program. Many building materials were obtained nationally&#13;
although some items, such as glass, were imported. The war resulted in a virtual cessation of local&#13;
materials production but there are now multiple examples of a regeneration of domestic production. The&#13;
capacity of the local building materials industry is of vital importance for the housing rehabilitation&#13;
process, especially for large-scale reconstruction programs. Materials can be imported by donors, but the&#13;
local economy will not benefit much unless it regains its domestic production and marketing capacity.&#13;
4.     The materials needed for building repairs are cement, aggregates, clay products (blocks, roof&#13;
tiles), timber, glass, sanitary/ plumbing items, electrical wiring and fittings and decorative paints. These&#13;
materials are readily available either within RS, in the Federation, or in neighboring FRY and Croatia.&#13;
Furthermore, demand for materials resulting from the Housing Component as well as from the overall&#13;
donor-funded reconstruction program for BH will necessarily lead to re-emergence of certain local&#13;
manufacturing capabilities, and the local supply situation will improve with time.&#13;
5.   The following table summarizes the availability of the principal building materials in RS at the&#13;
present time:&#13;

Attachment 4: Property Rights Issues in Housing&#13;
1.    The legal framework in BH governing property rights and pre-war rights of tenants in socially-&#13;
owned units has been complicated during the war and the period after the war due to the passage of&#13;
legislation seeking to facilitate housing for displaced people. Both the Federation of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina and RS passed respective laws dealing with "abandoned" units in an effort to allow their use&#13;
by displaced people. The Law on the Use of Abandoned Properties was passed in RS after the Dayton&#13;
Peace Agreement, in March of 1996. This law applies to both public and private property. Property is&#13;
considered abandoned if the owner or the holder of the right to use such property has deserted it. The law&#13;
recognizes the right of the property owner to reclaim his or her property if it is vacant, or if alternative&#13;
accommodation can be found for the occupant and he or she is paid compensation for repairs. The law is,&#13;
however, silent on the rights of legal tenants to return to their properties.&#13;
2.    Prior to the passage of the law in RS, authorities could apply prewar laws which stipulated loss&#13;
of occupancy rights in instances where units were vacated or rent was not paid. At the present time,&#13;
municipalities appear to interpret this law to mean that vacant public housing units are to be reallocated&#13;
by them, rather than by the legal owners which were principally enterprises and other social institutions.&#13;
This reallocation is generally through a municipal commission of refugees, or a housing commission&#13;
which comprises representatives of various institutions including the Ministries of Construction and&#13;
Refugees, municipal authorities, and the property registry. When the municipality declares a property&#13;
abandoned, the municipal council on refugees may allocate the property to other families for at least one&#13;
year and certificates to that effect are issued. However, while this allocation process is set out clearly in&#13;
the law, there are units that have been occupied by displaced people without formal allocation.&#13;
3.    The Office of the High Representative is concerned about the impact of this law of RS on the&#13;
ability of households to voluntarily return and to occupy their homes, whether public or private. The law&#13;
is considered to be contrary to the provisions of Annex 7 of the Dayton Agreement, as it essentially&#13;
interferes with the right of both owners and legal occupants to return to their properties. The RS&#13;
authorities are aware of this issue and of the need to change the law to conform to the Dayton provisions.&#13;
Given the shortage of habitable housing in many municipalities, however, it is difficult to foresee that&#13;
municipal authorities would easily find alternative accommodations for current occupants in order to&#13;
reinstate the rights of returning original tenants even where there is a willingness to do so.&#13;
4.    Additional pressure and claims on property will result from the desire of many host-countries to&#13;
support the return of refugees. The expectation is that they would be accommodated either in their own&#13;
units or in alternative units owned by others. To date, very few of the displaced have returned to areas&#13;
where they are minority groups. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a return of refugees from&#13;
asylum countries is likely to follow the same initial pattern of return to majority areas, which are not&#13;
necessarily where their original homes are located. Thus, housing would need to be found for these&#13;
refugees in a manner that is consistent with the Dayton provisions which allow temporary location of&#13;
displaced people in vacated units. Annex 7 assigns the Real Property Claims Commission the authority&#13;
to not only receive and rule on claims, but also to declare units abandoned, lease such units, settle claims&#13;
and provide compensation to owners or occupants who do not wish to return to their property. The&#13;
Commission has been established in March 1996 but has yet to start to register claims. Moreover, it is&#13;
unclear that this Commission will have the resources and necessary support to enforce its decisions.&#13;
5.    The conflicting claims and legislation will take time to resolve. In the interim, procedures need&#13;
to be set up to review the status of ownership and occupancy of units targeted for repair financed by&#13;
donors. The objective needs to be to address both (i) claims of owners and tenants to return to their&#13;
homes, and (ii) temporaty occuparcy or leasing rights and terms for those individuals who may have no&#13;
alternative accommodation to which they can easily return to for security or other reasons.&#13;

Attachment 5: Scope of Housing Repair Works to be Carried Out&#13;
Work Objectives&#13;
I .    Repairs to public apartment buildings shall be confined to the common elements and envelope of&#13;
these buildings, such as roofs, external fabric, common entrances, stairs, and utilities. The works aim to&#13;
provide: (i) a water tight dwelling unit; (ii) intruder-proofing to dwelling units (e.g. windows, doors and&#13;
locks as appropriate); (iii) weather-proofing of common access areas; and (iv) services (water, electricity&#13;
and drainage) to a single point for each dwelling unit. In order to achieve this level of repairs to common&#13;
facilities some or all of the elements of works may be undertaken but shall collectively remain within the&#13;
overall set budget for the property.&#13;
Standards, Materials and Workmanship&#13;
2.    The standards of materials and workmanship to be applied to house repairs shall not be less than&#13;
those applying to new building works in Bosnia and Herzegovina or in other parts of former Yugoslavia.&#13;
To achieve satisfactory performance contractors shall ensure that the best materials of the proposed type&#13;
shall be used in strict accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, to be installed by labor that has&#13;
been adequately trained for that purpose.&#13;
Roofs. Reconstruction of a roof shall include durable tiles or sheeting, battening, damp-proof&#13;
membrane, insulation and, where appropriate, roof timbers properly sized and secured. Flat roofs&#13;
will be repaired with materials and methods appropriate to the original construction. Works to the&#13;
roof shall include flashings, edge boarding, gutters and downpipes as appropriate.&#13;
External Walls. Patching to extemal walls will include cutting back locally damaged areas to&#13;
form a key, priming and the application of a suitable render. Where damage has occurred to the&#13;
structure of the wall, bricks shall be cut out and whole bricks of the samne type or better shall be&#13;
mortared in place. Balconies will normally not qualify for repair and access will be locked.&#13;
External Openings. Damaged or missing window frames will be repaired or replaced to match&#13;
the undamaged frame type. All windows will be fitted with a single 3 mm pane of glass,&#13;
correctly puttied in place such that where the franes are capable of accepting a second pane, it&#13;
can be fitted at a later date. Where applicable, one extemnal door will be provided complete with&#13;
security fittings comprising a key operated latch lock and an internal bolt.&#13;
Internal Walls. Internal walls of the common areas will have damaged blockwork made good&#13;
and plaster patched to an even finish prior to decoration. Any work to fixing electrical conduits&#13;
or similar shall have been completed prior to plaster repairs.&#13;
Ceilings. Where ceilings to the common areas are of a prefabricated concrete type, they will be&#13;
plastered and finished to the same standard as the walls. Where such ceilings are of a wooden&#13;
structure, repairs to the timberwork shall be carried out first. In no case will this work be carried&#13;
out in buildings where the roof has not been rendered water-proof.&#13;
Floors. Damaged ground floor concrete slabs in the common areas shall be covered with a&#13;
minimum 2 mm layer of tar, bitumen or similar. This membrane shall be protected with a&#13;
cement screed. Elsewhere in the common areas, damnaged areas will be cut back to sound&#13;
construction, primed, filled and cured to the original strength, blocks or tiles shall be cut out and&#13;
removed to be replaced with cement mortar. Untreated wooden floor panels shall only be fitted&#13;
over a layer of thermal and hydro-insulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 22 of 24&#13;
Doors. Doors will only be fitted to the entrance to the building, any access to the roof and to the&#13;
individual dwelling units. The type will be similar to the original of that predominating in the&#13;
building. Except at the entrance all such doors will be lockable.&#13;
Electrical and Lighting. Each dwelling unit will be equipped with a connection to a&#13;
distribution board including a mains isolator, four fused circuit supply ways and a meter. Only&#13;
lighting to the common areas will be repaired. As far as possible vandal resistant fittings will be&#13;
used.&#13;
Water Supply. A riser main to each dwelling unit will be provided with stop-cock within the&#13;
unit. Where necessary this supply will be pumped.&#13;
Sewerage. A damaged connection to the communal sewerage system will be repaired to provide&#13;
a single disposal connection to each unit.&#13;
Decoration. The exterior of the building will not be decorated.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Reconstruction Assistance Project&#13;
WATER AND SANITATION COMPONENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Sector Characteristics&#13;
1.    Prior to the war, water supply services in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) were of largely&#13;
satisfactory coverage and quality. About 70 percent of the urban population was covered, and a 24-hour&#13;
service was the norm. In rural areas, about 35 percent of the population were connected to piped water&#13;
supply systems, the remaining population had on-site water supply facilities such as springs or wells.&#13;
2.    In the area of Republika Srpska (RS), prior to the war there were some 50 urban water supply&#13;
systems covering about 56 percent of the pre-war population, and about 9,800 village water supply&#13;
systems providing service to 44 percent of the population. Regarding sewerage services, about 60&#13;
percent of the urban population and about 10 percent of the rural population were covered. Most of the&#13;
remaining population had on-site sewage treatment and disposal facilities such as septic tanks. Domestic&#13;
sewage treatment plants were available in the towns of Trebinje, Celinac and Tmovo.&#13;
3.    Large industries in BH had their own water supply and waste water disposal systems. Their total&#13;
water production exceeded the urban domestic production by some 50 percent. River pollution through&#13;
industrial and domestic waste water was a significant issue, as many mumicipalities and industries&#13;
discharged their waste waters without treatment into domestic rivers. On the other hand, solid waste&#13;
collection was generally well managed throughout BH, leaving urban areas largely litter-free. Solid&#13;
waste disposal was canied out by use of landfills, but only few sites did comply with proper sanitary&#13;
landfill standards. Except for three documented cases, industrial solid wastes were not separated and&#13;
were deposited along with domestic garbage. Operation and maintenance of water and sanitation services&#13;
was not a cost-covering business, requiring partial financial support from the public budgets.&#13;
4.    RS has at its disposal adequate water resources and sufficient precipitation. It is estimated that&#13;
about 80 percent of the domestic water demand is covered by ground and spring water, which requires in&#13;
general only chlorinating in order to comply with drinking water standards. However, water turbitity&#13;
problems may arise after heavy rain storms. Less safe is the Karst ground water since Karst aquifers lack&#13;
the filtering characteristics provided by aquifers within granular media. Surface water is often polluted&#13;
and requires expensive treatment. The average precipitation in RS amounts to approx. 1,250 mm per&#13;
year, with a range of 900 mm in the Sava River valley in the north and 1,600 mm in the Karst areas of&#13;
the south.&#13;
Sector Organization&#13;
5.    Prior to the war, the primary responsibility for provision of water supply, solid waste and&#13;
sanitation services rested with the municipalities. In contrast, policy setting, master planning, sector&#13;
regulation, technical support to municipalities, flood control and the construction of regional water&#13;
systems were central government functions. The government also provided to the municipalities most of&#13;
the financing required for major investment projects. The responsible government ministry was the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture. Water Management and Forestry, and its implementing agency was the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 2 of 23&#13;
Vodoprivreda BiH (VBH) with a staff of about 350. The municipalities provided water, sewerage and&#13;
refuse collection services through Komunalcos (municipal service companies) that functioned like&#13;
municipally-owned joint stock companies. In the past, project proposals for investments were generally&#13;
initiated by these Komunalcos. If projects were of local nature and did not require federal funding, they&#13;
were also planned and carried out by the Komunalcos. In the event that projects were of regional scope,&#13;
they were implemented by VBH.&#13;
War-related Damage and Current Situation&#13;
6.    The war had a major impact on the existing institutions, both from an organizational point of&#13;
view and regarding their effectiveness to carry out their responsibilities. The division of responsibilities&#13;
between the central government and the municipalities remains the same as prior to the war. However, at&#13;
the Entity government level, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the RS now have&#13;
independent water management organizations, Vodoprivreda BiH (VBH) in the Federation and Zavod za&#13;
Vodoprivreda Republika Srpska (ZVRS) in RS.&#13;
7.    The head office of ZVRS which at the beginning of the war was established in Ilidza near&#13;
Sarajevo was shifted to Pale after conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement. ZVRS branch offices are&#13;
located in Banja Luka, Bijeljina and Trebinje. Staffing levels are down both at the central government&#13;
and the municipal levels. The major personnel losses have been from the ranks of the most qualified&#13;
staff who have left the country. ZVRS also faces other difficulties such as limited, inadequate office&#13;
space and the loss of basic engineering and statistical data on the water and sewerage systems that had&#13;
been collected prior to the war.&#13;
8.    The war has affected the water supply and sanitation sector in many ways. There are physical&#13;
damages along the former confrontation lines affecting facilities located primarily above the ground&#13;
level, including water pumping stations, water and sewage treatment plants, reservoirs, and river dikes.&#13;
There are also war impacts related to the loss of service vehicles, loss of mechanical and electrical&#13;
equipment, and due to unfinished construction works which were started before the war. However, the&#13;
most severe impact is felt from system malfunctions due to lack of maintenance and of replacement&#13;
investments during and after the war period. Other war related problems are area contamination caused&#13;
by land mines along former front-lines; the overloading of water supply and sanitation services due to&#13;
heavy population shifts; and the disruption of water services in areas where the water source and the&#13;
water supply area have been separated by the Inter-Entity Boundary Line.&#13;
9.    As a result of the above factors, water supply and sanitation services have seriously deteriorated&#13;
throughout RS. The 24 hour water supply services are no longer the norm. Due to lack of proper water&#13;
treatment, water quality may not comply with drinking water standards. There are problems with&#13;
blocked sewers, and most sewage treatment plants are reported to be either out of order or not functioning&#13;
properly. Solid waste collection suffers from the lack of trucks and containers. None of the present&#13;
landfill sites in use meet sanitary standards, and they largely fail to protect water courses and&#13;
groundwater from pollution. Of particular concern is the dumping of wastes into former gravel pits and&#13;
on river banks. Regarding river pollution, the impact of the war offers a mixed picture: While many&#13;
factories have shut down and no longer discharge waste water into rivers, thus improving water quality&#13;
considerably, the breakdown of domestic sewage treatment plants and of services for septic tanks has led&#13;
to increased bacteriological pollution in rivers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 3 of 23&#13;
10.   Lack of maintenance and delayed replacement investments constitute the primary reason for the&#13;
issues faced in the water and sanitation sector today. Both result from constraints of access to labor and&#13;
capital during the war. Poor cost recovery is a key factor since water services were offered at very low&#13;
cost, including prior to the war. The municipal water service departnents are not financially independent&#13;
and rely on payments from the central govenmnent to help cover the cost of system operation and&#13;
maintenance. Many municipal service organizations are still understaffed.&#13;

11.   No major reconstruction as taken place in the water and sanitation sector in RS since the end of&#13;
the hostilities. Some limited emergency assistance was provided by ECHO, ODA, the Red Cross,&#13;
Norway, IFOR and some NGOs for the supply of the most urgently needed materials, works, equipment&#13;
and spare parts, so as to start with repairs to selected facilities. The total value of this combined&#13;
assistance is estimated to be in the order of US$ 5 million for all of RS during 1996.&#13;
12.   Under the supervision of the International Management Group, consultants have been employed&#13;
in late 1996 to prepare a comprehensive Emergency Reconstruction and Development Plan for the water&#13;
supply, waste water and solid waste sectors of RS. This plan and study were completed by December of&#13;
1996 and comprise some 50 urban centers in RS with more than 2,5i0 inhabitants tach. Data -ollection&#13;
was carried out via survey questionnaires and focused on information regarding water supply, water&#13;
availability, water quality, water losses, sewerage services, damage to sewers, treatment plant conditions,&#13;
and solid waste services. A comprehensive listing of damages and required priority investments has been&#13;
developed under this study and forms the basis for the preparation of the proposed Water and Sanitation&#13;
Component under the Reconstruction Assistance Project.&#13;
Sector Issues&#13;
13.   High unaccounted-for water losses in the water systems throughout BH are a matter of major&#13;
concern. It is estimated that, before the war, these losses ranged between 30 and 50 percent while today,&#13;
they vary between 40 and 60 percent. War activities have contributed indirectly to this issue since&#13;
fighting and the economic break-down prevented current maintenance. However, the primary cause of&#13;
high losses are decades of neglected maintenance prior to the war. One contributing factor is that system&#13;
maintenance and repairs were under the responsibility of the municipalities which did not achieve&#13;
adequate levels of cost recovery, while water sector investment programs were under the responsibility of&#13;
VBH at the state level. The emphasis was placed on developing new sources, rather than on reducing&#13;
technical losses in existing systems or on educating consumers on water conservation. Developing new&#13;
resources and systems may indeed be more economic in areas where water resources are abundant. In&#13;
contrast, water loss reduction should be given priority where water production costs are high due to&#13;
expensive water treatment or the high cost of water pumping.&#13;
14.   As a result of the war, health risks have increased. Due to the present intermittent water supply&#13;
in most municipalities, sewage from leaking sewers may infiltrate into water pipelines, potentially&#13;
affecting a large number of people at the same time. Furthermore, health risks arise from water treatment&#13;
plants which fail to produce water of drinking water quality. The discharge of raw sewage from sewerage&#13;
systems without working treatment plants or any treatment facilities, also from sewage pumping stations&#13;
and septic tanks that are of order, is posing health risks to down-stream users of the polluted river waters.&#13;
In Karst areas, underground channels and downstrearn Karst springs may become polluted as well. A&#13;
further danger are blocked sewers, resulting in overflow of sewage and pollution of water courses and&#13;
ground water. Uncollected or illegally dumped refuse will attract rats and flies. To date, however, the&#13;
authorities are unable to provide detailed information on water-borne diseases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 4 of 23&#13;
15.   There are also institutional and legal issues relating to the transition of the water construction and&#13;
consulting industry from public to private status and ownership. In the Federation of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina, a number of newly registered private companies in the water sector have emerged, usually&#13;
with some share of ownership remaining in the public sector. The same process is expected to take place&#13;
in RS. These private companies are generally founded by and composed of individuals who used to work&#13;
for public water companies and institutes, and many of these individuals carried out most of the&#13;
construction and engineering work in the water sector prior to the war. Questions of asset transfer and&#13;
ownership arise during this transition phase. More importantly for the implementation of donor-financed&#13;
projects, however, is the question whether these newly created enterprises dispose of the required&#13;
physical and financial resources so as to carry out works on time and to cover any losses or legal&#13;
obligations which may arise during the execution of works entrusted to them.&#13;
16.   The key financial issue in the water sector relates to cost recovery for water and sanitation&#13;
services. Most municipalities have been unable to collect for their services during the war, even if&#13;
sufficient efforts were made for billing of households and industrial users. In the immediate post-war&#13;
period, collection of water charges is hindered by a number of factors, including high unemployment and&#13;
low household income, the large number of refugees and displaced persons who also often have no&#13;
means to pay, and the still heavily reduced levels of services that consumers receive, especially in RS,&#13;
which leads to an unwillingness to pay charges. Also, municipalities and households need to adjust to a&#13;
new economic situation vvhere the Entity governments are no longer wilinig nor ablc to it, -&#13;
financially the cost of water system operation and maintenance. To ensure the sustainability of future&#13;
repair investments to be made, benefiting municipalities must commit themselves to achieve adequate&#13;
recovery of at least their operating costs over the short term through improved billings and collections.&#13;
17.   One of the sector priorities facing the RS Government is to establish an efficient organization of&#13;
water and sanitation institutions, taking into consideration the new market-based economic regime where&#13;
central planning will increasingly be replaced by largely decentralized investment decisions at the&#13;
municipal level. This implies cost recovery through user charges rather than funding of costs through&#13;
fiscal transfers. It also implies delegation of more authority to the municipalities which will themselves&#13;
set development and investment priorities and carry them out in accordance with applicable laws and&#13;
regulations. However, in the short term, municipalities are not equipped to take over investment-related&#13;
responsibilities. The RS Institute for Water Management (ZVRS) will need to be strengthened to the&#13;
extent necessary so as to manage and monitor water repair investments financed by donors during the&#13;
initial years after the end of the war. At the same time, private sector involvement in repair works should&#13;
be encouraged as much as possible by involving local private firms to prepare detailed designs, to carry&#13;
out repair and installation works, and to handle independent construction and site supervision.&#13;
18.   Regarding existing sewage systems in RS, most systems are designed for combined collection of&#13;
sewage and storm water and discharge raw sewage into the rivers. In order to introduce environmentally&#13;
acceptable solutions, some of these installations will have to be converted into separate systems, allowing&#13;
for distinct pipeline systems for sewage and storm water. Also, sewage treatment plants will have to be&#13;
constructed in larger villages and for all urban settlements. While necessary and desired by the&#13;
authorities, however, many of these measures will be very costly to implement. Prospects for donor&#13;
financing for them during the initial post-war emergency period are limited, given that many households&#13;
remain without any water, sewage or solid waste removal services. As a first priority, therefore, low-cost&#13;
solutions that allow for replacement of key equipment on otherwise functional sewerage systems are&#13;
aimed for. This includes removing blockages and structural damages to sewers, the rehabilitation of&#13;
sewage pumping stations, and repairs of sewage treatment plants.&#13;

B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
19.   To assist the Bosnian authorities to restore essential water and sanitation services, the Bank is&#13;
committed to assist both Entities within BH to address the most basic and urgent reconstruction needs&#13;
through emergency-type projects. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in March 1996, the&#13;
Bank approved a US$ 20 million Credit for a Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Urgent Works Project&#13;
(FY96). Together with donor partners such as the European Union and the governments of Austria, the&#13;
Netherlands and others, through that project the Bank is assisting the Federation to install urgent&#13;
replacement equipment, carry out priority rehabilitation works, draft an emergency development plan for&#13;
the water sector, and strengthen key institutions. The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project is the&#13;
equivalent emergency project designed to assist the RS authorities in a similar manner.&#13;
20.   The Bank's support to Bosnia's water sector is part of the agreed intemational reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation program for water and waste management of BH of about US$ 363 million, to be&#13;
implemented over three to four years, which the Bank has helped to develop in a joint effort with the&#13;
country and the donor community.' This program aims to restore water, sewage, solid waste disposal,&#13;
flood control, and irrigation systems to pre-war levels, and to establish the proper institutional&#13;
arrangements to make the improvements sustainable (see Table 1).&#13;

Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
21.   Through its support for the Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Urgent Works Project in the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bank was able to assist the Federation to secure substantial&#13;
additional donor cofinancing. It is expected that the Bank's support for an emergency-type water sector&#13;
rehabilitation program in RS would result in a similar success to raise donor funding. The Bank has also&#13;
relevant pre-war experience in Bosnia's water sector through two Loans to former Yugoslavia which&#13;
benefited the Sarajevo water and waste water system and helped improved water supply in the Tuzla&#13;
region.2 Through its recent involvement in a variety of water and sanitation projects in emerging market&#13;
economies in Central and Eastern Europe, the Bank has gained experience on a number of key&#13;

institutional issues in the sector, such as cost recovery and decentralization of investment management,&#13;
and is therefore in a good position to offer financial assistance and policy advice to the RS authorities.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/ IDA Experience&#13;
22.   There are several key lessons learned from the Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Urgent Works&#13;
Project in the Federation since April 1996. These have been incorporated into the proposed project and&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
*  Construction of new infrastructure should be financed only when existing facilities are properly&#13;
managed. In the presence of high unaccounted-for water losses, donor assistance should be&#13;
conditional on the development of a demand management program.&#13;
*  Waster water treatment should initially concentrate on primary treatment. Secondary and tertiary&#13;
treatment should be considered on a case-by-case basis only.&#13;
*  Strengthening of the local water authorities is critical for sustainable sector development.&#13;
*  Financial assistance to municipalities should be given on equal terms. All municipalities should&#13;
receive long-term loans, even if some donor contributions are provided to the government as grants.&#13;
*  Close donor coordination is critical to avoid duplication of efforts and allow for the establishment of&#13;
common sector policy principles. Coordination needs to take place through the water sector task&#13;
force and the local water authorities.&#13;
Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
23.   The Water and Sanitation Component of the Reconstruction Assistance Project will complement,&#13;
in part, the other components of this project (agriculture, housing, and electric energy) by generating&#13;
improved living conditions for returning refugees and displaced persons. Since there will be one joint&#13;
Project Coordination Unit established for all four components, it will be possible to target selected&#13;
municipalities where two or more project components provide benefits to the same population, thus&#13;
following an integrated area approach to economic reconstruction.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
24.   The primary objective of the Water and Sanitation Component is to restore water, sanitation and&#13;
solid waste services, in selected RS target municipalities, to a level that will satisfy basic human needs,&#13;
mitigate public health risks and support the return of economic activity.&#13;
25.   The secondary objectives of the Component are (i) to strengthen institutions necessary for the&#13;
recovery of the sector; (ii) to introduce improved cost recovery so as to allow for maintenance of&#13;
investments over time; (iii) to promote private enterprise development in the water sector; and (iv) to&#13;
assist the RS authorities in developing a medium-term sector strategy that would address all essential&#13;
service needs of the population while implementing adherence to adequate environmental standards.&#13;
Through financing of repair works, the Component would also create local employment and income.&#13;
Selection of Municipalities and Investments&#13;
26.   Target municipalities in RS included under the Component have been selected according to the&#13;
following three criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 7 of 23&#13;
*  municipalities along the former confrontation lines that have suffered significant damage to water&#13;
supply, sewage and solid waste collection systems&#13;
*  municipalities facing a shortage of water and sanitation services due to an inflow of displaced&#13;
persons and refugees&#13;
*  municipalities which are of economic importance, are confronted with urgent investment needs in the&#13;
water sector, and allow for cost-effective high-return repair investments&#13;
27.   While the various needs of the population related to water and sanitation services are very large,&#13;
first priority would be given to the restoration of water supply services in adequate quantity and quality,&#13;
in view that domestic water supply is a basic human need. Least-cost solutions have been selected when&#13;
facing the choice between developing additional water resources or alternatively reducing water losses in&#13;
existing water supply systems. The second priority are sewage investments aiming to repair existing&#13;
systems in order to avoid health hazards, mostly through rehabilitation of blocked and broken sewers.&#13;
Third priority is given to investments in solid waste disposal, primarily through investments into garbage&#13;
collection trucks and containers. The full rehabilitation of existing municipal garbage disposal sites is&#13;
not feasible within the scope of this first emergency-type assistance program. Furthermore, a medium and&#13;
long term strategy for the sector would likely call for development of larger regional sanitary landfill&#13;
sites rather than an extension of the present landfills.&#13;
Component Elements&#13;
28.    To support the above objectives, the Water and Sanitation Component has four elements: (i)&#13;
urgent works; (ii) refuse collection equipment; (iii) technical support; and (iv) institutional strengthening.&#13;
Element 1: Urgent Works&#13;
29.    The project would finance urgent rehabilitation works, including required material and&#13;
equipment, to restore water supply and sewage services in 18 RS municipalities. Works will include&#13;
rehabilitation and repair of water sources, supply pipelines, water treatment plants, distribution networks,&#13;
the cleaning and repair of sewers, and rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations. See Table 2 for&#13;
detailed cost estimates which include physical contingencies. Cost estimates have been compared with&#13;
and verified against unit costs incurred under the parallel water sector project in the Federation of Bosnia&#13;
and Herzegovina, in implementation since mid-I 996. The attachment provides a more detailed&#13;
description of the urgent works to be carried out in each target municipality.&#13;
Element 2: Refuse Collection Equipment&#13;
30.    The project would finance the purchase of refuse trucks and collection containers, together with&#13;
critical spare parts. The equipment and materials would benefit a total of 20 RS municipalities. See&#13;
Table 3 for cost estimates. The detailed distribution list for this equipment is attached.&#13;
Element 3: Technical Support&#13;
31.    The project would finance technical assistance and consultant services.  For preparation of&#13;
detailed designs and tender documents under Element 1, mostly local consultant services would be used.&#13;
Local consultants would also be employed to carry out on-site supervision of rehabilitation works. They&#13;
would be complemented by a foreign monitoring expert who would verify quality of designs, review the&#13;
performance of site supervisors, and assess the quality of construction. Furthermore, in order to prepare&#13;
for essential future investments in the water and sanitation sector, the project would finance a number of&#13;

32.   The project would support the Institute for Water Management of RS, Zavod za Vodoprivreda,&#13;
RS (ZVRS) so as to strengthen its administrative and engineering capacity to manage and monitor project&#13;
implementation. At present, ZVRS receives hardly any funding from the RS govemment and has&#13;
insufficient office space. The project would finance office equipment and supplies, vehicles and also a&#13;
share of the incremental operating costs and consultants of ZVRS. See Table 5 for cost estimates.&#13;

34.    Of the total component cost, the World Bank would finance US$ 5.0 million equivalent. This&#13;
financing would cover the following cost items: urgent water and sanitation repair works (US$ 3.19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Pane 10 of 23&#13;
million) 3; refuse collection trucks and containers (US$ 0.80 million); engineering, preparation of designs&#13;
and tender documents, and works supervision (US$ 0.20 million, equivalent to about 6 percent of the&#13;
value of Bank-financed repair works); the expatriate monitoring expert (US$0.18 million); ui&amp;#2;ent studies&#13;
for future works (US$ 0.30 million); office equipment, furniture, vehicles and incremental operating&#13;
costs for ZVRS (US$ 0.22 million); and local ZVRS staff and consultants (US$ 0.11 million). Donor&#13;
cofinancing for most of the balance of costs has been committed by the European Union (US$ 12.7&#13;
million, to be implemented outside of the PCU structure, using EU implementation mechanism) and by&#13;
Austria (US$ 0.5 million, also not using the PCU structure for implementation). Norway has also&#13;
tentatively committed about US$ 5 million in support of this Component. See the financing plan shown&#13;
in Table 7.&#13;

Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
35. The Water and Sanitation Component would help restore essential urban water, sanitation and&#13;
solid waste disposal services to levels that would make urban centers livable, reduce health risks and&#13;
support the return of economic activity. Since the primaiy focus is on rehabilitation works, economic&#13;
rates of returns are expected to be in excess of 30 percent. These returns result from a reduction in the&#13;
large amount of unaccounted-for water and the related decline in the usage of electric energy and&#13;
chemicals. Rehabilitation works carried out now will also help save future replacement investments&#13;
which, in the absence of the Component, would have to be carried out eventually so as to replace entire&#13;
systems for both water and waste water.&#13;
36.    The two main Component risks are delays in the start-up and implementation of repair works,&#13;
and the potential inability of municipalities to operate and adequately maintain the repaired systems in&#13;
the future. Implementation may be delayed due to a slow start of preparation of detailed designs and&#13;
bidding documents. To reduce this risk, local consultants in RS have been engaged since early 1997,&#13;
using available project preparation grant funds, to prepare the first detailed designs and draft required&#13;
bidding documents prior to Board approval. Most of the procurement and sample contracting&#13;
documentation used for the parallel project carried out during 1996 in the Federation has been made&#13;
available to the local consultants in RS. An experienced expatriate expert that helped start up the&#13;
Federation project is assisting the RS authorities. The second risk relates to low billings and collections&#13;
for services, and hence insufficient cost recovexy by the municipalities. Charging of fully cost-covering&#13;
service fees will take time. To facilitate this process and reduce the associated project risk, each&#13;
benefiting municipality will be required to submit to the Bank a specific plan to recover recurrent and&#13;
investment costs over time, as set out further below.&#13;
The following municipalities are envisaged for Bank financing of repair works: Bijeijina, Brcko,&#13;
Modiica,&#13;
Novi Grad, Srp. Gradiska, Bratunac, Rogatica, Sokolac, Srbinje, Tmovo, and Visegrad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;

Environmental Aspects&#13;
37.   The Reconstruction Assistance Project has been placed in environmental category B. The Water&#13;
and Sanitation Component would have a positive environmental impact as a result of reduced water&#13;
losses, a safer water supply, improved sewage collection, and proper disposal of solid waste. There is no&#13;
resettlement involved. All works would be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no&#13;
degradation to the environment.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Component Organization and Implementation&#13;
38.   The Banja Luka office of the Institute for Water Management of RS, Zavod za Vodoprivreda, RS&#13;
(ZVRS) would have the primary responsibility for the execution of the Water and Sanitation Component.&#13;
The organizational chart of ZVRS is attached. ZVRS is part of the RS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry&#13;
and Water Management. At present, the Banja Luka office of ZVRS employs three engineers and two&#13;
support staff. Under financing from the Component, the Banja Luka office would establish a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU), consisting of several experienced staff from ZVRS and of outside&#13;
consultants.  This PIU would be responsible for day to day project management, engineering,&#13;
coordination and supervision. In particular, the PIU would:&#13;
*  draft terms of reference for local consultant-engineers who will prepare detailed designs and bidding&#13;
documents for works and goods&#13;
* under the supervision of the central Project Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Finance (see below),&#13;
procure the above consultant-engineers and enter into contracts with them&#13;
e  review final designs and bidding documents prepared by consultants, and forward them to the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit for subsequent bidding&#13;
- evaluate bids received from contractors and suppliers for execution of works and supply of goods,&#13;
and prepare evaluation reports for the Project Coordination Unit&#13;
*  draft terms of reference for local on-site construction supervision by consultant firms or individuals&#13;
* under the supervision of the Project Coordination Unit, procure the above construction supervision&#13;
consultants and enter into contracts with them&#13;
* monitor construction quality and progress, review the performance of site supervisors&#13;
*  verify bills prepared by contractors and checked by site supervisors and forward them to the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit for payment&#13;
*  be present at the commissioning of the works, together with representatives of the municipality, the&#13;
contractor and the site supervisor, and prepare the hand-over protocol&#13;
*  organize distribution of imported refuse collection equipment to the municipalities&#13;
*  obtain required documentation from municipalities on cost recovery and system operation and&#13;
maintenance (see further below)&#13;
*  report to the Project Coordination Unit on Component implementation progress&#13;
39.   The cross-sectoral Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the RS Ministry of Finance will open a&#13;
Water and Sanitation Department. This Department will be composed of two water engineers and will&#13;
operate for a duration of 18 months. The Department will be in charge of tendering as well as&#13;
disbursement activities, through the PCU Financial Controller, for works, goods and services under the&#13;
Water and Sanitation Component. Preparation of procurement documents, evaluation of bids, and&#13;
contracting of small-value local consulting services will be the responsibility of the PIU in ZVRS, as&#13;
outlined above. However, procurement processing, including seeking the Bank's no-objection on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Paye 12 of 23&#13;
contract awards, as well as contract signing, contract disbursements, and Component accounting and&#13;
reporting would be the responsibility of the Water and Sanitation Department, supported by the PIU in&#13;
ZVRS. The Water and Sanitation Department will also procure and enter into the contract with the&#13;
expatriate monitoring expert who would independently review the quality of designs and tender&#13;
documents, the performance of on-site supervisors, and the quality of construction.&#13;
40.   The Water and Sanitation Component is designed to be implemented within a 24 month time&#13;
frame. Preparatory activities by ZVRS are under way to select local consultants for the preparation of&#13;
detailed designs and bidding documents. Since early 1997, ZVRS is being supported by an expatriate&#13;
advisor financed under available trust fund resources.&#13;
Cost Recovery and Onlending Arrangements&#13;
41.   Most water and sewage works in RS have been unable to collect for their services during the war.&#13;
It would be difficult to reinstate charges in the short term, and it is unlikely that any municipality would&#13;
be able to contribute to the cost of the Component from any other source than in kind. Nevertheless,&#13;
there should be a commitment by the municipalities to obtain cost recovery in the future. Therefore,&#13;
within six months after effectiveness of the World Bank Credit, every municipality benefiting from repair&#13;
works under this Component will be required to submit to ZVRS a time-bound program for raising water&#13;
charges and increasing collections of billed charges. Each program submitted would permit recovery of&#13;
recurrent costs of the operation and maintenance of water and sanitation systems within three years, and&#13;
recovery of all costs including capital investments within seven years. The submission of such programs&#13;
would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit agreements between RS and each municipality&#13;
described below.&#13;
42.   The RS Govemment, through ZVRS as its agent, would make available Bank and other donor&#13;
funding to the benefiting municipalities on the basis of credit agreements, covering the cost of urgent&#13;
works and of refuse collection equipment (Component Elements I and 2). The onlending terms would be&#13;
30 years maturity at zero interest including seven years grace. The credit agreements between RS and&#13;
each municipality would provide for a percentage of the amounts received to be forgiven. The&#13;
percentage would be determined as soon as the repayment conditions of all donor financing for the&#13;
Component are known with certainty. It would be calculated by dividing the amount of grant financing&#13;
in the Component financing plan by the total cost of the Component. It is estimated that about 65&#13;
percent of each municipal credit could be forgiven. The costs of Component Elements 3 and 4 would be&#13;
borne by RS.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
43.   The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 8, the procurement plan for&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Component is attached. In case of parallel financing by other donors, the&#13;
applicable procurement procedures of the respective financiers would be used.&#13;
44.   The Bank will finance civil works contracts for repair and rehabilitation of water and sewage&#13;
systems, valued at US$ 3.0 million, to be procured under Simplified National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(SNCB) procedures. Individual contracts under SNCB would be valued at less then US$ I million&#13;
equivalent per contract. The average contract size is expected to be around US$ 400,000. SNCB&#13;
contracts would be lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from&#13;
three pre-qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation would include a detailed&#13;
description of the works, the basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of&#13;
agreement and drawings when relevant. Prior approval by the Bank will be required for the first five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 13 of 23&#13;
contracts for urgent works and any contracts exceeding a value of US$ 400,000 equivalent. Prior to the&#13;
initiation of any procurement action, the Water and Sanitation Departnent will provide the Bank with a&#13;
procurement plan detailing the number of contracts to be procured, bid invitation dates, as well as&#13;
expected start and end dates for each contract.&#13;

f   Consultant services consist of a number of individual consultants. Their services would be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines which shall include both competition and sole sourcing. The sole sourcing would be justified in each&#13;
case.&#13;
45.    A pre-qualification of contractors will be carried out. For this purpose, a notice will be published&#13;
in the local press and announcements will be made inviting local and national, private and state-owned&#13;
contracting firms to express their interest in different levels of contract values. Pre-qualification criteria&#13;
will be subject to prior approval by the Bank. Bidders shall provide information using standard forms&#13;
issued by the Water and Sanitation Departnent and shall meet the following minimum criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 3&#13;
Page 14 of 23&#13;
* demonstrated capacity as a contractor to successfiully complete works in an amount up to the&#13;
aggregate contract value specified&#13;
* demonstrated experience as a contractor in the construction of similar works of nature and&#13;
complexity to the proposed works&#13;
* demonstrated ability to provide all essential workers for completion of the works specified in the bid&#13;
46.   Pre-qualification will result in a listing of contractors with individual established contract limits.&#13;
Contractors will be invited to submit bids for works contracts up to their established upper contracting&#13;
limit. State-owned construction enterprises must meet the Bank's eligibility criteria of autonomous legal&#13;
status and absence of govemment subsidies of their operations.&#13;
47.   In addition to SNCB, works under Force Account would be financed by the Bank up to an&#13;
aggregate limit of US$ 190,000. Force Account would be used for the installation of equipment and&#13;
minor repair work within the capability of the staff of municipal water, sanitation and solid waste&#13;
organizations and valued at less than US$ 50,000 per contract. To qualify, organizations would need to&#13;
demonstrate that they have the equipment, capacity and experience to undertake the work.  An&#13;
appropriate accounting and supervision mechanism will be put in place to ensure cost-effectiveness.&#13;
48.   Using Intemational Shopping, the Bank would finance the purchase of solid waste collection&#13;
trucks and containers, up to an aggregate value of US$ 800,000. Three IS contracts are expected for such&#13;
equipment, valued at less than US$ 400,000 each. Also, the Bank would finance office equipment, office&#13;
fumiture and vehicles using Intemational Shopping, at a combined value of US$ 170,000, broken down&#13;
into four contracts.&#13;
49.   Furthermore, the Bank will finance US$ 0.79 million of local and expatriate consultant services.&#13;
The services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both competition&#13;
and sole sourcing. Sole sourcing of services will need to be justified in each case. Such justification&#13;
may be the timing constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and lack of candidates given the post-conflict&#13;
situation in RS. No assignments have been pre-identified for sole sourcing. Any sole sourcing during&#13;
implementation will be subject to the Bank's approval. Follow-up assigmments will be permissible to the&#13;
extent that this will be indicated in the initial Terms of Reference. The Bank will also finance&#13;
incremental operating costs of ZVRS up to an aggregate value of US$ 50,000. Operating costs would be&#13;
reimbursed based on an approved program and budget.&#13;
50.   From the experience gained of the parallel project in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,&#13;
it is not expected that procurement agents would need to be engaged. The Water and Sanitation&#13;
Department of the Project Coordination Unit, together with ZVRS, and assisted by a qualified and&#13;
experienced expatriate advisor, is expected to be able to carry out procurement of works contracts quickly&#13;
and efficiently. Sample documentation available from the Federation project should facilitate the&#13;
procurement task in RS. Post review of procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly basis by&#13;
Bank supervision missions. The Bank's Procurement Specialist in the Resident Mission in Sarajevo will&#13;
assist with prior review of the first five works contracts. Furthermore, monitoring of procurement will be&#13;
facilitated through quarterly reporting, which will be part of the regular quarterly progress reports under&#13;
the overall project.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
51.   The disbursement plan is given in Tables 9 and 10. Disbursements are expected to be completed&#13;
within a period of less than three years from the date of effectiveness. The Bank Credit would finance&#13;
the categories of expenditures outlined in Table 11. Further details on disbursement procedures,&#13;

Water and Sanitation Component of the project. Details on these accounts, as well as on auditing and&#13;
supervision procedures to be followed, are applicable to all project components and are therefore set out&#13;
in the main text of the overall project documentation.&#13;
&#13;

increasing collections of billed charges to a level that would permit recovery of operating costs&#13;
within three years and recovery of all costs, including capital investments, within seven years.&#13;
&#149; Agreement that the RS Government, through ZVRS as its agent, would make available Bank and&#13;
other donor funding to municipalities on the basis of credit agreements, covering the cost of urgent&#13;
works and of refuse collection equipment. The onlending terms would be 30 years maturity at zero&#13;
interest including seven years grace.&#13;
*  Agreement that the submission of time-bound programs for raising water-related revenues would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness of the credit agreements between RS and each municipality.&#13;

T'he above accelerated implementation schedule is based on the experiences gained during the parallel 1996 project carrded&#13;
out in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Actual imnplemnentation dates will depend on the date of IDA Credit&#13;
effectiveness and availability of donor cofumacing,&#13;
Component supervision through the World Bank would be carried on a continuous basis through staff of the Resident Mission&#13;
in Sarajevo.&#13;

ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENT&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Electric Power Sector in RS'&#13;
1.    The electric power sector in Republika Srpska (RS) is operated by Elektroprivreda Republika&#13;
Srpska (EPRS). EPRS was established on June 2, 1992 as a public utility charged with generating,&#13;
transmitting and distributing electricity, and required coal, in RS. EPRS is comprised of 11 autonomous&#13;
public owned corporations, consisting of: (i) 5 generation companies, as follows: Trebinje Hydro Power&#13;
Stations, Visegrad Hydro Power Station, Bocac Hydro Power Station, Gacko Thermal Power Plant and&#13;
Coal Mine, and Uglievik Thermal Power Plant and Coal Mine; (ii) one transmission company:&#13;
Elektroprenos at Banja Luka; (iii) and 5 distribution companies, as follows: Elektrokrajina Banja Luka,&#13;
Elektrodistribucija Pale, Elektrodistribucija Doboj, Electrodistribucija Bijeljina, and Elektrodistribucija&#13;
Trebinje. See the attachment for an organizational chart.&#13;
Power Generation&#13;
2.    The total installed electricity capacity in EPRS service areas is about 1,293 MW, of which 735&#13;
MW are hydroelectric power and 558 MW are thermal power. Hydroelectric power plants include&#13;
Trebinje I (138 MW), Trebinje II ( 8 MW), and Dubrovnik (164 MW) on the Trebinje River, Visegrad&#13;
(315 MW) on the Drina River, and Bocac (110 MW) on the Vrbas River. Thermal power plants include&#13;
Ugljevik (300 MW) and Gacko (300 MW). In 1995, electricity generation in the territory of RS was&#13;
2,355 GWh (or 56 percent of the total generation in Bosnia and Herzegovina), and electricity&#13;
consumption was 2,264 GWh. 2 Electricity exchange with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1995&#13;
anmounted to imports of about 400 GWh and exports of some 327 GWh. Most of the plants have suffered&#13;
throughout the war from the lack of maintenance on installed equipment. Rehabilitation of the Ugljevik&#13;
thermal plant and associated coal mine has been started in 1996, financed by the United Kingdom under&#13;
the Bank-supported Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project (FY96).&#13;
Transmission System&#13;
3.    The electric transmission system in RS includes two parts: western RS (the northem and westem&#13;
parts of RS located around Banja Luka), and eastem RS (areas located east and south of the Posavina&#13;
corridor). These two parts are currently interconnected by 110 kV lines through the Posavina corridor.&#13;
The transmission network and control system were largely damaged, particularly in those areas located&#13;
close to the former confrontation lines. The network includes 474 km of 400 kV lines, 315 km of 220&#13;
kV lines, and 1,553 kh  of 110 kV lines. Total capacity of the transmission substations is about 4,220&#13;
MVA. Reconstruction of a 400 kV transmission line between Ugljevik and Banja Luka has been started&#13;
in 1996. A section of the 220 kV transmission line running through Central Bosnia from Trebinje to&#13;
For a detailed description of Bosnia's pre-war electric power sector, and for more infonnation on the&#13;
present situation of the sector within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, refer to the project&#13;
documents of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project (FY96).&#13;
This compares with a pre-war generation, in 1990, for all of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 13,090 GWh and&#13;
an electricity consumption of 11,181 GWh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 2 of 21&#13;
Bihac has been completed. Completion of these lines, particularly the 220 kV line, will restore the&#13;
linkage between the RS and the Federation power grids. Repair of a 110 kV line between the cities of&#13;
Visegrad, Gorazde and Foca was completed in 1996. Restoration of this 110 kV transmission line will&#13;
improve the power ability in Gorazde.&#13;
Distribution Network&#13;
4.     The RS distribution network includes Banja Luka, Pale, Doboj, Bijeljina, and Trebinje. The&#13;
networks include 67,884 km of overhead lines, 9,114 km of cables, and 3,129 MVA transformer stations&#13;
capacity. Many of the distribution networks have been significantly destroyed as a result of localized&#13;
fighting and lack of maintenance. Many transformer stations, civil works structures, telecommunications&#13;
and maintenance equipments are also seriously damaged or destroyed. Rehabilitation of a part of the&#13;
distribution networks in Doboj, Bijeljina, Srebrenica, Gorazde, Foca and Mrkonjic Grad has been started&#13;
in 1996.&#13;
Power Sector Issues&#13;
5.     There are two main technical issues relating to the electric power sector in RS. First, power&#13;
generation sources are mainly concentrated in the eastem part of RS; however, the major load center is&#13;
located in the western part of RS. Existing transmission linkage between the eastern and westem parts of&#13;
RS is weak and cannot ensure reliable power supply from east to west. To ensure system reliability,&#13;
improving cooperation between RS and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and developing power&#13;
exchanges between the Elektroprivredas of the Federation and of RS through a newly reconnected 220&#13;
kV trans-country transmission system is critical.&#13;
6.     Second, the distribution networks in RS seriously deteriorated due to insufficient spare parts and&#13;
maintenance over an extended period, particularly during the war. In addition, there are sharp increases&#13;
in illegal consumption of electricity. Illegal usage of electricity for space heating is common in urban&#13;
areas due to shortage of fuel and failure of the district heating facilities. In the Banja Luka service area&#13;
alone, 30,000 refugee-households currently are using electricity without meters. These cause overloading&#13;
of the distribution and subtransmission system and have led to an increase of non-technical losses to a&#13;
current level of 13 percent.&#13;
7.     Prior to the onset of the hostilities in 1991, a single enterprise, Elektroprivreda Bosnia i&#13;
Herzegovina, was responsible for electricity generation, transmission and distribution over the whole&#13;
territory of the country, covering the areas now constituting the Federation and RS. In 1992, this single&#13;
enterprise was broken up into public utilities serving the areas under majority Bosniak, Croat, Serb&#13;
control, respectively. The resulting legal issues are as follows: (i) the entities are currently operating&#13;
under a mix of old and new legislation; new laws on electricity sector organization and operations are&#13;
under discussion but not yet adopted; and (ii) assets have nominally been transferred on the basis of the&#13;
respective areas of service; however, the distribution of liabilities of the pre-war electric utility company&#13;
between the successor enterprises has yet to take place.&#13;
8.    As a consequence of the war, several economic and financial issues arise that are critical for&#13;
sector rehabilitation. Electricity tariff levels in RS declined sharply during the war period. In 1991, the&#13;
average tariff level was 0.24 dinars per KWh (7 i per KWh). By end-1994, the average tariff level had&#13;
declined to 0.05 dinars per KWh (1.6 i per KWh). Since January 1995, the authorities made a number of&#13;
increases, each quarter, which led to an increase in the average tariff level to 0.178 dinars per KWh (3.5 E&#13;
per KWh) by July 1996. This was followed by a further significant increase in October 1996 which&#13;
brought the average levels to 0.268 dinars per KWh (5.4 d per KWh).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 3 of 21&#13;
9.     The financial situation of the RS power utilities seriously deteriorated during the war period.&#13;
Billing and collection ratios were affected by the economic difficulties of the population, including in&#13;
particular the large numbers of refugees and displaced persons. Accounts receivable mounted during the&#13;
war and prospects of recovery are limited, especially since the authorities decided to allow for debt&#13;
forgiveness in respect of billed amounts owed by households for years prior to 1995. While the average&#13;
tariff level has been raised substantially, actual collection ratios continue to be low, affecting internal&#13;
cash generation of the utilities. Current levels of cash generation are inadequate to fully cover current&#13;
operating and maintenance costs. The power entities will need the firm support by the RS Government&#13;
to enforce collections and raise revenues to required minimum sustainable levels. The financial situation&#13;
of the utilities would be further strained when settlements were to be made in respect of the inter-entity&#13;
distribution of liabilities.&#13;
10.    Regarding institutional aspects, the existing situation of three largely separate power systems in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes an obstacle to safe, efficient and economic operations. Measures are&#13;
needed to introduce a sector structure that would facilitate inter-entity coordination and cooperation and,&#13;
over the longer term, attract potential (foreign) investors.&#13;
Reconstruction Objectives&#13;
11.    Based on preliminary assessments, estimates by EPRS of total war-related damage in the power&#13;
sector in RS equal about US$ 330 million. About 54 percent of this damage is in the distribution&#13;
network, 27 percent is in the transmission system, 14 percent in power plants, and 5 percent in coal&#13;
mines. EPRS has prepared an investment program for reconstruction and plans to carry this out over the&#13;
next several years.&#13;
12.   A preliminary review of the EPRS investment program shows that estimated investment needs&#13;
appear to be on the high side. The core of priority investments should be more clearly defined for the&#13;
next several years. Besides ongoing urgent repairs, systematic rehabilitation of the existing power plants&#13;
- the most capital intensive investments in the sector - requires considerable preparatory works and&#13;
feasibility studies. In order to review and evaluate the possibility of full scale rehabilitation of the&#13;
existing power plants and associated coal mines, the operational status of major civil works and of plant&#13;
equipments needs to be reviewed, fuel requirements and sources of supply have to be specified, and&#13;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures should be evaluated.&#13;
13.   In the EPRS investment program, the economic and technical justification for efficiency and&#13;
availability improvements and! or life extension; the role of the rehabilitated units in meeting system&#13;
demand; and the recommended technology for rehabilitation of the main civil works and generation units&#13;
should be defined in detail. Rehabilitation of the associated coal mines should ensure the critical coal&#13;
supply from the most efficient mines, in line with the fuel needs of the power plants. Under financing&#13;
from the European Union, it is expected that a detailed study will be carried out through consultants&#13;
which will review the investment proposals submitted by EPRS for the 1997-99 period.&#13;
14.    Currently, some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina lack power generation capacity, while others&#13;
have relative surpluses. Ensuring in the short term a sufficient and uninterrupted power supply to all&#13;
areas will therefore only be possible by developing power exchanges between the two Entities. The&#13;
situation in the Banja Luka area which is supplied from the eastern part of RS through unreliable 110 kV&#13;
transmission linkages could be significantly improved if power was also provided by the Federation&#13;
power companies through the newly commissioned 220 kV transmission linkage from the Federation into&#13;
RS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 4 of 21&#13;
15.    The priority for the 1997 electric power rehabilitation program for RS should focus on 110 kV&#13;
transmission facilities, including transmission lines and substations, and on distribution networks to&#13;
ensure resumption of a reasonable level of power supply to the population, especially to cut-off areas and&#13;
areas with serious power shortages. Rehabilitation of the 220 kV core system is well underway, which&#13;
would facilitate the above-mentioned power exchange between the Entities. The 400 kV transmission&#13;
system is mainly for interstate transmission, rehabilitation of which should wait until a thorough study&#13;
has been completed. The study should be carried out jointly by the Elektroprivredas of the Federation&#13;
and RS, taking into account the new environment and the network reconfiguration.&#13;
B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
Bank Strategy&#13;
16.    The Bank is committed to assist the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and RS to address&#13;
urgent reconstruction needs in the electric power sector through emergency-type projects.  In the&#13;
Federation, in July 1996, the Bank has a approved a US$ 35.6 million Credit for an Emergency Electric&#13;
Power Rehabilitation Project (FY96). Together with a large number of other donor partners supportng&#13;
this project, the Bank is assisting the Federation authorities to rehabilitate power generation plants,&#13;
reconstruct transmission lines and substations, rehabilitate communication and control systems, rebuild&#13;
distribution networks, and supply spare parts and maintenance vehicles to the power utilities in the&#13;
Federation.&#13;
17.    The proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project is the first equivalent emergency project&#13;
designed to assist the RS authorities to address the most urgent and critical needs for repairs in the power&#13;
sector. The second, larger project benefiting RS in the electric power sector would a Second Electric&#13;
Power Project, financing repairs to generation, transmission and distribution in both the Federation and&#13;
RS. However, preparation of this second power project is not expected to be finalized prior to the end of&#13;
1997. Therefore, the Electric Power Component under the proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project&#13;
would enable the RS authorities to meet the most pressing needs for systems repairs early on.&#13;

18.   The Bank's support to Bosnia's electric power sector is part of the agreed international&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation program for electric power and coal mining of BH of about US$ 614&#13;
million, to be implemented over three to four years, which the Bank has helped to develop in a joint&#13;
effort with the country and the donor community.' This program aims to (i) restore services to acceptable&#13;
levels; (ii) restore output of the lowest-cost coal mines to minimum required levels; (ii) improve the&#13;
sector finances through increased billing and collections; and (iv) restructure the electric power and coal&#13;
sectors. Donor financing is being sought for a variety of investments, as set out in Table 1.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
19.   In close cooperation with other main donors such as the European Union, the United States and&#13;
the United Kingdom, the Bank was able to attract substantial cofinancing from other smaller donors to&#13;
assist the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to start implementing the Emergency Electric Power&#13;
Reconstruction Project during 1996.  It is expected that the Bank's support for electric power&#13;
rehabilitation in RS would also result in securing donor cofinancing. Prior to the war, the Bank has been&#13;
heavily involved in the energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH), notably in electric power,&#13;
petroleum and natural gas. Through six different power sector projects alone the Bank helped finance the&#13;
development of Former Yugoslavia's interconnected power system, the construction of hydro power&#13;
plants and dams, the establishment of an energy management system, and the installation of an air&#13;
pollution control system for Sarajevo. Through this prior experience, the Bank is familiar with the&#13;
technical, institutional and financial issues facing the two Entities within BH today and is in a good&#13;
position make available technical advice and targeted financial assistance.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/ IDA Experience&#13;
20.   There are several lessons leamed from implementation of the Emergency Electric Power&#13;
Reconstruction Project since mid-1996. These have been incorporated into the proposed project and are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
* The electric power utility company of the Entity is in the best position to prepare technical&#13;
specifications and bidding documents for equipment and carry out installation-related works;&#13;
procurement of items itself may be centralized in a project unit of the Entity government.&#13;
* Close communication between the power utility and the Bank during the initial project phase of&#13;
specification development and procurement is critical. The permanent presence of a Procurement&#13;
Specialist in the Bank's Resident Mission in Sarajevo is a key factor for early project start-up.&#13;
* Donors supporting the project are to be invited to work through the electric power utility company of&#13;
the Entity when designing and implementing repair works. At the least, donors must keep the utility&#13;
company informed on the status of their project activities to ensure full coordination.&#13;
* Local labor and contractors should be used as much as possible, when consistent with economy and&#13;
efficiency in procurement, since they can be mobilized faster than foreign contractors for a given job,&#13;
especially when work is to be done in widely dispersed areas.&#13;
*  Different contracting methods should be used, such as tum key arrangements, to facilitate smooth&#13;
and timely project implementation.&#13;

Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects&#13;
21.   The Electric Power Component of the Reconstruction Assistance Project will complement, in&#13;
part, the other components of this project (agriculture, housing and water and sanitation) by securing&#13;
reliable supply of electric power in the target area of the project around Banja Luka. Complementarity&#13;
also exists with respect to other Bank-supported projects that will benefit this area within RS.&#13;
Furthermore, the project will help prepare and start up the subsequent envisaged Second Electric Power&#13;
Project which is scheduled for Board consideration by early 1998.&#13;
C. COMPONENT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
22.   The objective of the Electric Power Component is to improve reliability, availability and quality&#13;
of electricity supply in the target area within RS.&#13;
Target Area&#13;
23.   Given the emergency nature and therefore limited size of the Electric Power Component, the&#13;
Component needs to focus on a well-defined target area in order to deliver the impacts expected. In&#13;
coordination with the RS authorities, the area around Banja Luka has been selected as a priority area to&#13;
improve supply of electricity to industrial and residential users. Of Banja Luka's current residents of&#13;
some 220,000 (1996), about 72,000, or one third, are displaced persons. In the entire region around&#13;
Banja Luka, about one quarter of the 670,000 inhabitants are displaced persons.&#13;
24.   The power transmission and distribution network in and around Banja Luka has suffered&#13;
extensive war-related damage and degradation, resulting in frequent network overload and outages. In&#13;
particular, the 100 kV and 35 kV substations and lines, and the MV/LV distribution networks are in very&#13;
poor condition. Therefore, their urgent rehabilitation will greatly improve the living conditions of the&#13;
displaced and other resident population in this area. Given the importance of this region for the RS&#13;
economy, enterprises and industrial users would also benefit from such rehabilitation.&#13;
25.   The power supply network in the Banja Luka area relies on four voltage levels, as follows below.&#13;
The proposed rehabilitation effort would focus on 110 kV transmission facilities and distribution&#13;
networks.&#13;
26.   400/ 220/ 110 kV level. This represents supply to the Banja Luka 6 (400/ 110 kV) substation&#13;
which practically feeds the entire service area. The 110 kV network comprises 470 km of overhead lines&#13;
linking the five 110 kV substations in Banja Luka, three 110 kV substations in Prijedor, and 110 kV&#13;
substations in Novigrad, Dubica, Gradiska, Srbac, N. Topola, Laktasi, and Kotor Varos. At present, the&#13;
electric power transmitted throughout the area is almost entirely generated by the Ugljevik thermal power&#13;
plant in the eastern part of RS, and complemented by hydro power plants at the Vrbas River. By late&#13;
1997, the 110 kV system in the Banja Luka service area will have been reconnected with the newly&#13;
reconstructed 220 kV Trebinje-Mostar-Jablanica-Jaice-Prijedor-Bihac trans-country transmission line,&#13;
through the 220/110 Prijedor 2 substation. Power supply to Banja Luka from generating sources located&#13;
in south-eastem and central parts of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina could then be resumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 7 of 21&#13;
27.    35 kV level. The 35 kV network comprising about 35 km of lines and four 35/20/10 substations&#13;
is designed to supply the industrial consumers in suburban and rural areas.&#13;
28.    10/ 20 kV level. This MV network comprising 967 km of lines and 405 secondary substations is&#13;
for supply of suburban and rural areas, for feeders linking switching substations of the urban center, as&#13;
well as for secondary MV/LV transformer substations.&#13;
29.   Low voltage (0.4 kV) level.  This network provides for electricity distribution to local&#13;
consumers.&#13;
Component Elements&#13;
30.   To support the above objectives in the Banja Luka area, the Electric Power Component has the&#13;
following elements: (i) 110 kV transmission rehabilitation; (ii) 35 kV distribution rehabilitation; (iii)&#13;
Banja Luka distribution repairs; (iv) telecommunication repairs; (v) testing equipment and maintenance&#13;
tools; and (vi) engineering and management.&#13;

Element 4: Telecommunication Repairs&#13;
34.   Prior to the war, the telecommunication system for the Banja Luka - Prijedor - Mrkonjic Grad&#13;
distribution network provided voice communication, data acquisition, and tele-control functions for the&#13;
network. During the war, this telecommunication system was heavily damaged in the Banja Luka area.&#13;
To retain control of the distribution network and to operate it efficiently, repair of this telecommunication&#13;
system is an urgent necessity. This Component element will include a turn-key package for repairing the&#13;
damaged telecommunication towers and replacing required equipment, valued at US$ 650,000. In&#13;
addition, HF devices and a telephone exchanger would be financed valued at US$ 90,000.&#13;
Element 5: Testing Equipment and Maintenance Tools&#13;
35.   Testing equipment and maintenance tools for transmission and distribution facilities are wom out&#13;
and in very short supply. The component will cover a minimum amount of testing equipment and&#13;
maintenance tools for the Banja Luka service area. The total package is valued at US$ 580,000, detailed&#13;
specifications have been prepared.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Element 6: Engineering and Management&#13;
36.   The project will finance required engineering services to prepare detailed designs and tender&#13;
documents and to manage and supervise all Component-related tasks. These services, valued at US$&#13;
400,000, will be delivered and financed by Elektroprivreda RS through Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina&#13;
(see further below). To support engineering and Ct. aponent management within Elektroprenos and&#13;
Elektrokrajina, the project will finance the supply of basic office equipment, including computer&#13;
hardware and software, as well as fax and copy machines, within a budget limit of US$ 50,000.&#13;
Component Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
37.   The total estimated cost of the Component is shown in Table 5. Physical contingencies of 3&#13;
percent on goods and 7 percent on works are included. No price contingencies have been included given&#13;
the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Donor-financed items under the&#13;
intemational reconstruction program are tax-exempt in RS. More detailed cost estimates and further&#13;
descriptions of the items to be financed are provided in the attachment.&#13;

World Bank contribution would finance the import of transmission and distribution equipment and parts,&#13;
testing and maintenance equipment, as well as office equipment. Table 6 shows the financing plan.&#13;
While the Bank and other donors would finance the foreign cost element (US$ 12 million) of the&#13;
Component, the beneficiary electric power enterprises, Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina of Banja Luka,&#13;
would provide the funds required to finance the local costs (about US$ 4 million equivalent). Norway&#13;
has also tentatively committed about US$ 5 million in support of this Component.&#13;

39.   During the war, the cash flow of Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina was severely affected by low&#13;
collection ratios relative to billings. If the RS Govermment provides relief to electric power consumers in&#13;
respect of outstanding dues from the years 1994 and 1995, this would result in a write-off of receivables&#13;
in an amount of about US$ 2 million for Elektrokrajina, Banja Luka and about US$ 11 to 12 million for&#13;
the Elektroprivreda system as a whole. The activities and financial situation of both enterprises is&#13;
described further below.&#13;
40.   Given the above situation, Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina are expecting to raise the required&#13;
financing for the local cost element through an increase in collection ratios, which would in turn depend&#13;
upon Government support for enforcement actions in cases of non-payment. There is also an expectation&#13;
of 1997 exports of surplus power of about 1,500 GWh to neighboring countries such as Yugoslavia,&#13;
Croatia and Greece. Furthermore, due to the necessity of using force account to implement the local cost&#13;
element, the actual level of net incremental local financing required would be substantially less than the&#13;
value of the gross amount of about US$ 4 million. The major part of the civil works would be performed&#13;
by already employed, but largely idle technical staff and work force whose salaries would have to be paid&#13;
in any case. Nevertheless, in the event that Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina are unable to raise the&#13;
necessary local funds, it has been agreed that the RS Government would be prepared to cover any&#13;
resulting financial gaps through grants or subordinated debt to these two enterprises.&#13;
Benefits and Risks&#13;
41.   The proposed investments would repair damaged transmission and distribution networks which&#13;
would restore a reliable supply of electricity to the Banja Luka area, a pre-condition for normal economic&#13;
life to return to this part of RS. A least-cost approach is being followed to ensure economy of&#13;
investments. By rehabilitating a transmission and distribution area that is connected to and would benefit&#13;
from electricity exchange with the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Electric Power Component&#13;
would also provide an incentive for increased cooperation and commercial relations between the electric&#13;
power enterprises in both Entities.&#13;
42.   The main Component risks are delays in its execution which could arise due to a shortage of&#13;
local financing or a lack of external donor funding. To minimize this risk, provisions have been made for&#13;
the RS Government to cover any financial gap regarding local cost financing for required civil works to&#13;
install the imported materials and equipment. Regarding mobilization of external donor financing, given&#13;
the largely modular nature of the investments to be carried out, if donor financing could not be secured&#13;
on time and in full, a reduced number of transmission and distribution lines and systems would be&#13;
repaired initially. Further investments could follow if and when donor financing becomes available. The&#13;
project presents no physical risks since reconstruction and rehabilitation of standard secondary&#13;
transmission and distribution facilities are involved.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
43.   The Reconstruction Assistance Project has been placed in environmental category B. All items&#13;
procured under the Electric Power Component which present an opportunity for environmental&#13;
enhancement will be specified accordingly, and item usage will be monitored during supervision to&#13;
ensure that there is no degradation to the environment.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina&#13;
44.   The main implementing agencies and beneficiaries under the Electric Power Component would&#13;
be Elektroprenos Banja Luka which is the transmission company for RS, and Elektrokrajina Banja Luka&#13;
which is the distribution company for the Banja Luka area and the largest of its kind in RS.&#13;
45.   ElektroUrenos Bania Luka (EPBL). EPBL was formed from the former Elektroprenos Bosnia i&#13;
Herzegovina which was responsible for power transmission for the entire territory of pre-war Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina. EPBL covers the territory of the RS, with sub-operations in Banja Luka, Visegrad and&#13;
Trebinje, and maintains its head office in Banja Luka. EPBL is also responsible for imports and exports&#13;
of electricity, at present mainly with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&#13;
46.   Revenues from electricity sales are shared between the generating, transmission and distribution&#13;
enterprises on the basis of a formula that, at present, results in an effective distribution in the proportions&#13;
63:5:32. EPBL therefore receives ar6und 5 percent of the total revenue collections on the territory of the&#13;
RS. As for the RS Elektroprivreda system as a whole, EPBL's financial situation has been seriously&#13;
affected by low billing and collection ratios, leading to substantial losses of about 39 million dinars (US$&#13;
8.5 million equivalent) in 1995 and a further 29 million dinars (US$ 6.3 million) in the first six months&#13;
of 1996. As a result, while EPBL's current collection levels appear adequate to cover cash operating&#13;
costs, they do not enable generation of amounts necessary for adequate system maintenance and&#13;
expansion. A summary of EPBL's financial situation in 1995 and the first six months of 1996 is&#13;
provided in Table 7.&#13;

47.   Elektrokraiina Bania Luka (EKBL). EKBL is responsible for power distribution in the Banja&#13;
Luka area, covering Banja Luka as well as the municipalities of Prijedor, Gradiska, Kozarska Dubica,&#13;
Novi Grad, Mrkonjic Grad and Pmjavor. It is the largest power distribution company in RS,&#13;
accountingfor 27 percent of total sales in RS. The company has about 1,200 employees. In 1995, it was&#13;
supplying electricity to about 153,000 domestic consumers; 8,000 commercial establishments; 540 public&#13;
sector consumers; and 150 industrial customers.&#13;

48.   EKBL's financial situation has suffered during the war period. Billings declined from a level of&#13;
around 2,470 million dinars (US$ 70 million equivalent) in 1991 to around 40 million dinars (US$ 12&#13;
million) in 1995, of which only about 17 million dinars were collected. Subsequently, billings have&#13;
improved in 1996 to about 111 million dinars (US$ 24 million), reflecting the five-fold increase in the&#13;
average tariff level, with an expected collection of about 50 million dinars (US$ 10 million) or a&#13;
collection ratio of about 42 percent. Although this represents a considerable improvement in collection&#13;
rates, at these levels cash collections are inadequate to cover EKBL's total operating expenses. A&#13;
summary of EKBL's financial situation is provided in Table 8.&#13;
49.   EKBL is projecting electricity sales to increase from about 610 GWh in 1995 to about 900 GWh&#13;
in 1997 and 990 GWh in 1998. Average tariffs are expected to remain at around 0.268 dinars/KWh&#13;
(5.4c/KWh) in 1997 and to increase to 0.31 dinarslKWh (6.2c/KWh) in 1998. On this basis, EKBL is&#13;
expecting to reach operating cost break-even in 1998.&#13;
Component Organization and Implementation&#13;
50.   Elektroprivreda of Republika Srpska (EPRS) would have primary responsibility for the execution&#13;
of the Electric Power Component. A Project Management Group (PMG), consisting of experienced staff&#13;
from EPRS, Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina, will be set up in Banja Luka under EPRS's supervision&#13;
and be responsible to organize and supervise the rehabilitation of the transmission system and&#13;
distribution networks in the Banja Luka area. The PMG would be directed by the General Director of&#13;
EPRS, and assisted by a Technical Director of Elektroprenos on transmission, and Technical Director of&#13;
Elektrokrajina on distribution. The office of the PMG, responsible for day to day project management,&#13;
engineering, coordination and supervision, will be established in the Elektroprenos office building in&#13;
Banja Luka. The PMG would receive cross-support from Elektroprenos' and Elektrokrajina's related&#13;
departments in selected areas, such as engineering and technical support, legal matters, budgeting,&#13;
accounting, disbursement, man-power allocation, and operational support.&#13;
51.   The implementation of the 110 kV transmission subprojects (Banja Luka I substation, and&#13;
transmission lines Banja Luka 1--Banja Luka 6, Banja Luka 6--Prijedor 2, and Banja Luka 6--Banja Luka&#13;
3) would be the responsibility of Elektroprenos. The implementation of the 110 kV transmission&#13;
subprojects (Banja Luka substations No. 2, 3 and 4, and transmission lines Banja Luka 1--2, Banja Luka&#13;
6-4, Banja Luka l--Laktasi), the 35 kV subproject, and the Banja Luka distribution networks would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 13 of 21&#13;
the responsibility of Elektrokrajina. The telecommunication component would be jointly implemented&#13;
by Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina.&#13;
52.   The cross-sectoral Project Coordination Unit in the RS Ministry of Finance will open an Electric&#13;
Power Department. This Department will be composed of two electric power engineers and will operate&#13;
for a duration of 18 months. The Department will be in charge of tendering and disbursement activities,&#13;
through the PCU Financial Controller, as far as they relate to donor-financed goods and services.&#13;
Preparation of procurement documents will be the responsibility of the PMG, while procurement&#13;
l processing, contract signing, contract disbursements as well as Component accounting and reporting&#13;
would be the responsibility of the Electric Power Department, supported by the PMG.&#13;
53.   Equipment deliveries would be made direcdy to the warehouses of the power companies or to&#13;
construction sites. Since the replacement of transmission and distribution equipment needs to be carried&#13;
out under operational conditions, installation and related civil works would be implemented through&#13;
force account using technical staff and the workforce of Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina. The&#13;
installation of major equipment will be carried out under the supervision of the respective supplier.&#13;
54.   The Electric Power Component is designed to be implemented within a 24 month time frame.&#13;
Preparatory activities by Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina are well under way to finalize technical&#13;
specifications and prepare bidding documents.&#13;
Cost Recovery and Onlending Arrangements&#13;
55.   At current tariff levels of about 5.4c/KWh, EKBL and EPBL should be able to cover their cash&#13;
operating expenses provided that the collection ratios can be significantly improved over existing levels.&#13;
Thus, for EKBL, a cash break-even in 1997 would require an improvement in the collection ratio to&#13;
around 56 percent, up from the current level of 42 percent in 1996. Covering of total operating costs,&#13;
including depreciation, by 1998 would require a further increase in average tariffs from the 0.268 dinars&#13;
per KWh at present to around 0.31 dinars KWh (or 6.26 per KWh). At these levels, the electricity prices&#13;
charged to consumers -would still remain substantially below those charged in most OECD countries.&#13;
56.   The RS Government would make available Bank and other donor funding for the Electric Power&#13;
Component to the two beneficiaries, EPBL and EKBL. These funds would be on-lent at the IDA service&#13;
charge over a 20-year maturity, including five years of grace. The amounts of Bank funding on-lent to&#13;
EPBL and EKBL by the RS Government would be equal to the value of equipment imported for repairs&#13;
to transmission (EPBL) and to distribution (EKBL) facilities, respectively.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
57.   The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 9, the procurement plan for&#13;
the Electric Power Component is attached. In case of parallel financing by other donors, the applicable&#13;
procurement procedures of the respective financiers would be used.&#13;
58.   Procurement of equipment and materials financed by the Bank will be in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines applicable for emergency-type projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For&#13;
goods and equipment, Limited International Bidding (LIB) and International Shopping (IS) procedures&#13;
will be used. IS will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard specification&#13;
commodities, estimated to cost between US$ 200,000 and US$ 1.0 million per contract. IS is based on&#13;
comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.  Direct&#13;
Contracting (DC) will be used for proprietary items, for reasons of compatibility and standardization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 4&#13;
Page 14 of 21&#13;
National Shopping (NS) will be used for supply of a small amount of basic office equipment to support&#13;
project engineering and management. Installation activities and related civil works, financed by&#13;
Elektroprivreda, would be done by force account.&#13;

LIB: one contract package valued at US$ 1.2 million for steel structures, and one contract for anti-&#13;
corrosion paint (US$ 0.46 million). The Bank will also finance one contract package for the replacement&#13;
of damaged MV and LV switchgears, to be procured under LIB, at a value of US$ 1.4 million. The Bank&#13;
will furthermore finance one package under Direct Contracting for the overhaul of transformers, valued at&#13;
US$ 0.31 million. -Two packages for transmission testing equipment and for distribution testing&#13;
equipment, at a combined value of US$ 0.58 million, will be procured under IS. Any Direct Contacting&#13;
beyond the above-mentioned package will require prior Bank approval. Bank funds will also be used to&#13;
procure, under National Shopping, office computers and software, fax and copy machines, and&#13;
miscellaneous office supplies, valued at US$ 50,000.&#13;

60.   The required capacity to carry out the above procurement activities will be concentrated in the&#13;
Project Coordination Unit where an experienced expatriate procurement advisor, familiar with Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines, will be based. From the experience gained under the first emergency-type&#13;
electric power project in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, carried out during 1996, the electric&#13;
power utility should be in a good position to prepare detailed technical specifications and bidding&#13;
documents so as to assist the Project Coordination Unit. Post review of procurement actions will be&#13;
carried out by Bank supervision missions, assisted by the Procurement Specialist in the Bank's Resident&#13;
Mission in Sarajevo who will also carry out the prior review of packages going to Direct Contracting.&#13;
Post review monitoring of procurement will furthermore be facilitated through quarterly reporting to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
61.   The disbursement plan is given in Tables 10 and 11.  Disbursements are expected to be&#13;
completed within a period of two years from the date of effectiveness. The Bank Credit would finance&#13;
the categories of expenditures outlined in Table 12. Further details on disbursement procedures are&#13;
provided in the main text of the overall project.&#13;

62.   Separate and auditable accounts would be established by the PCU for expenditures within the&#13;
Electric Power Component of the project. Details on these accounts, as well as on auditing and&#13;
supervision procedures to be followed, are applicable to all project components and are therefore set out&#13;
in the main text of the overall project documentation. In addition to standard auditing requirements for&#13;
project records, the financial statements of Elektroprenos Banja Luka and Elektrokrajina Banja Luka&#13;
would be audited annually by independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
63.   The Electric Power Department will provide to the PCU management quarterly inputs for&#13;
progress reports showing the status of implementation of the Electric Power Component, including&#13;
summary information on procurement contracts, in a format acceptable to the Bank. Specific reporting&#13;
elements for the Electric Power Component include the following project information and performance&#13;
monitoring indicators:&#13;
*  Procurement information for electricity equipment: number and value of contract packages; details&#13;
on key procurement steps and dates, expected completion dates for installation&#13;
*  Number and qualification of staff employed within the Project Management Group in Elektroprenos&#13;
*  Number and cost of work force carrying out the civil works for installation of equipment&#13;

Component:&#13;
*  Agreement that, in the event that Elektroprenos and Elektrokrajina are unable to carry out and finance&#13;
the local cost element of this Component in a timely manner, the RS Government will cover any&#13;
resulting financial gaps through grants or subordinated debt to these two enterprises&#13;
* Agreement that the RS Government would make available Bank funds to Elektroprenos and&#13;
Elektrokrajina through on-lending at the IDA service charge over a 20-year maturity, including five&#13;
years of grace.&#13;

Notes: The staff input of expatriate advisors for the sectoral Departnents has been included into the cost of the respective&#13;
sectoral project Component. The PCU may have several drivers to be financed by the RS Government. The accounts&#13;
manager and the database technician in the Housing Department would also support the Central Support Section on fmancial&#13;
record keeping and software support for implementation of the overall project. Staff changes (such as the addition of a&#13;
dedicated PCU office manager, if needed) would be agreed with the Bank during project implementation.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT MONITORING AND AUDIT UNIT&#13;
Experience with the PMAU in the Federation&#13;
8.     A Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit (PMAU) was established in November 1996 in&#13;
Sarajevo, with initial mandate and financing to cover activities within the area of the Federation of&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina over a two-year period. The purpose of the PMAU is to monitor and audit the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 5&#13;
Pare 4 of 7&#13;
procurement carried out by govemnmental implementing agencies, relating to reconstruction projects that&#13;
are funded by the Bank or financed by funds that are administered by the BanK for other donors. The&#13;
PMAU is fully operational, has been staffed with local auditors from the Institute of Accounting and&#13;
Auditing in Sarajevo, and is receiving long-term technical assistance by three expatriate experts. PMAU&#13;
staff are visiting Project Implementation Units of the Federation to monitor their ongoing procurement as&#13;
well as audit the procurement decisions already made. The PMAU is being funded out of donor grants.&#13;
9.    Under the procurement monitoring function, the PMAU monitors at least one full cycle of&#13;
procurement and disbursement transactions carried out by each executing government agency. For this&#13;
purpose, an assessment of methods and practices used by the executing agency concerned in procuring&#13;
goods and services is being made. The purpose is to ensure that these practices are in line with the&#13;
procurement policies and procedures agreed in the applicable Credit or Grant agreements, and that they&#13;
are reflected in the tender documents issued.&#13;
10.   In addition to procurement monitoring, the PMAU is carrying out ex-post annual procurement&#13;
audits for all projects financed or administered by the World Bank in FY96 and FY97. Also, specific&#13;
audits will be prepared on a case-by-case basis as requested by the Government and by the Bank.&#13;
Need for Procurement Monitoring and Auditing in RS&#13;
11.   Since mid-1996, the Bank has approved ten emergency reconstruction projects in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina that benefit both the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. Further&#13;
projects are planned to be presented to the Bank's Board of Directors for consideration which include&#13;
Republika Srpska as a benefiting Entity. As was the case in the Federation earlier on, Republika Srpska&#13;
has not yet established public procurement monitoring regulations, institutions or procedures that would&#13;
ensure a fully adequate review of procurement decisions taken by governmental staff who are&#13;
implementing donor-financed reconstruction projects.&#13;
12.   Therefore, under the proposed Reconstruction Assistance Project, the existing PMAU mechanism&#13;
would be extended into Republika Srpska. For this purpose the RS Government will enter into an&#13;
agreement with a qualified foreign consultant finn to assist the RS authorities to set up and maintain the&#13;
RS Office of the PMAU over a two-year period, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Outputs and Reporting&#13;
13.   The following auditing reports will be produced and submitted by the RS Office of the PMAU to&#13;
the Bank and the RS Government:&#13;
*  Inception Report, to be submitted not later than 4 weeks after the start of activities of the office&#13;
*  Monthly Progress Reports, to be submitted not later than one week after the end of each month&#13;
&#149;  Mid-Term Report twelve months after the effectiveness of the Bank Credit for the project, providing&#13;
details on progress in monitoring and auditing activities, training of staff, as well as design of&#13;
systems, policies, and procedures&#13;
* Final Report, including recommendations concerning the organization of procurement monitoring&#13;
and auditing in RS, required staffing, operational policies and procedures to be followed&#13;
*  Individual project audit reports upon request by the RS Government and the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Staffing Required&#13;
14.    The RS Office of the PMAU would be established at a location to be determined, probably in the&#13;
Banja Luka area given the proximity of a number project implementation units to be covered by the&#13;
PMAU. Under the project, World Bank resources would finance the following expenditures of this&#13;
Office: five local auditors for a period of two years; one full-time expatriate advisor for a period of 21&#13;
months; as well as office equipment and incremental operating costs. The project would also cover the&#13;
cost of the first year-end financial audit of the overall project by expatriate auditors. See Table 2 for&#13;
detailed cost estimates.&#13;
C. COMPONENT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Costs&#13;
15.    The estimated cost of the Implementation Support Component is shown in Table 2. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 3 percent on goods are included in the cost estimates. No price contingencies have been&#13;
included given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Donor-financed items&#13;
under the international reconstruction program are tax-exempt in RS. The financing plan is shown in&#13;
Table 3. Efforts would be made to secure additional donor grant financing for this Component.&#13;

            The Reconstruction Assistance
            Project's objectives are to:  1) assist
            economically-disadvantaged and war-affected farmers to
            restart and strengthen farming activities; 2) increase the
            quality and quantity of the public housing stock; 3) restore
            water, sanitation and solid waste services to meet basic
            human needs, mitigate public health risks and support the
            return of economic activity; and 4) improve reliability,
            availability and quality of electricity supply.  The project
            consists of five components.  The agriculture component will
            finance the purchase of breeding cattle and provide an
            emergency supply of critically needed farm mechanization
            equipment.  The housing component will finance repairs to
            multi-story non-system built socially-owned apartment
            buildings.  The water and sanitation component will finance
            works to restore water supply and sewage services in 18
            selected RS (Republika Srpska) municipalities.  The electric
            power component will finance repairs and rehabilitation to
            transmission lines and substations.  The implementation
            support component will finance the establishment and
            maintenance of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which
            will implement the agriculture and housing components, and
            supervise ZVRS (Zavod za Vodoprivreda, RS) and
            Elektroprivreda RS in implementing the water and sanitation
            and electric power components.
