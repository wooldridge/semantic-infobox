HUNGARY&#13;
QUICK START GAS TURBINE PROJECT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:                 MVM Rt (Hungarian Power Companies Ltd.)&#13;
Guarantor:                Republic of Hungary&#13;
Amount:                   US$60 million&#13;
Terms:                    15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest&#13;
rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;
Project Objectives:       The objective of the Project is to provide about 220 MW  of generation&#13;
reserve capacity to enable Hungary to maintain a high level of reliability and&#13;
security of supply. The Project would in particular enable Hungary to meet&#13;
the operating standards in effect in Western Europe, as set out by UCPTE,&#13;
to which MVM's system  is interconnected.  Through membership in&#13;
UCPTE, MVM benefits, inter alia, from system reserves shared by all&#13;
members. Furthermore, the Project will allow Hungary to enhance its role&#13;
as a transit country for electricity trade in Europe between the North and&#13;
South, as well as the East and the West.&#13;
Project Description:      The proposed project consists of two complete single cycle gas turbine&#13;
power plants rated 110 MW each burning light distillate fuel oil. The&#13;
plants will consist of: (i) gas turbine generator sets and auxiliaries, air inlet&#13;
and exhaust gas systems, including stacks; (ii) electrical equipment, as&#13;
required to serve the plants' needs; (iii) power plant control systems; (iv)&#13;
high voltage switchgear and unit transformers to connect the generator sets&#13;
to the 120-kV system; and (v) ancillary facilities.&#13;
Project Benefits:         The project is justified in terms of overall system needs, as it enters the&#13;
national least cost expansion program as early as 1998. A comparison with&#13;
alternative solutions, such as electricity imports and a pumped storage&#13;
plant, indicates that gas turbines represent the least cost means of providing&#13;
secondary reserves. The economic internal rate of return calculation, in&#13;
which the expected average wholesale capacity charges were taken as a&#13;
measure of willingness to pay for project benefits, resulted in an EIRR of&#13;
16%, which is satisfactory; various sensitivity analyses concluded that the&#13;
EIRR is quite robust under all the scenarios tested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- II -&#13;
Project Risks:             Project related risks are minimal given that: (i) MVM  has done thorough&#13;
investigations prior to selecting the project sites; (ii) power plant ratings&#13;
have been finalized following canvassing of the major manufacturers of gas&#13;
turbine generator sets and step-up substations; and (iii) procurement under a&#13;
single-responsibility contract would facilitate project coordination and&#13;
timely project completion.   In addition, MVM  faces different types of&#13;
financial risks particularly since it operates on thin profit margins, and is&#13;
committed to long term electricity purchases and sales agreements.&#13;
However, these risks are manageable given the strategic role of MVM in&#13;
the sector, the new framework under which tariffs are elaborated, and the&#13;
intention to partially privatize MVM.&#13;

QUICK START GAS TURBINE PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
PART I. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. The Economy&#13;
1.1   Hungary is an upper-middle income country with a GNP per capita of US$3,840 in 1994&#13;
for a population of 10.3 million. Hungary experimented with market-type reforms much earlier&#13;
than the other formerly centrally planned economies. The "New Economic Mechanism",&#13;
introduced in 1968, aimed at substituting market prices for the central plan as an allocative&#13;
mechanism. The pace of reform was significantly accelerated in the late 1980s. These efforts&#13;
were successful in building up some of the basis of the legal and institutional framework of a&#13;
market economy. However, the authorities did not respond appropriately to the emergence of&#13;
internal and external disequilibria, as indicated by the increase of the overall fiscal deficit to&#13;
7.1% of the GDP and of the current account deficit to 9.2% of GDP in 1993-94. Inflation was&#13;
running at about 20% per year. Up to early 1995, the all-encompassing welfare system inherited&#13;
from communism was left virtually intact, and two-thirds of the State assets remained to be&#13;
privatized.&#13;
1.2  In March 1995, the Hungarian Government announced a set of measures aimed at&#13;
stabilizing the economy, including substantial cuts in fiscal expenditures, increases in fiscal&#13;
revenues, devaluation of the forint, followed by a pre-announced crawling peg, and a strict wage&#13;
policy. These measures contributed to a significant improvement in the country's external&#13;
position. Despite a strong fiscal contraction, a slight recovery in GDP has been sustained. The&#13;
Government's resolve to consolidate the stabilization efforts was clearly reflected in the&#13;
implementation of the 1996 Central Government budget. This budget resulted in a significant&#13;
contraction in the General Government deficit, from 6.7% of GDP in 1995 to 4.0% of GDP in&#13;
1996, and drove Hungary's current account deficit to around US$1.8 billion (4.1 %), or very close&#13;
to its long-run target. The stabilization program is being supported by an IMF Stand-By loan&#13;
(approved in March 1996), but so far Hungary has not drawn on this loan.&#13;
1.3   The stabilization measures have been accompanied by an invigoration of structural reforms,&#13;
including an acceleration of the privatization of state-owned banks and enterprises. These efforts&#13;
resulted, in the second half of 1995, in privatization of large utilities and transfer to private&#13;
investors of two of the large state-owned banks. Due to these sales, foreign direct investment in&#13;
1995 increased to a record volume of more than US$4.0 billion (9.0% of GDP). The Government&#13;
is continuing to implement a comprehensive and in-depth program of structural measures, designed&#13;
to complete the enterprise and banking sector reforms.&#13;
&#13;

B. Energy Resources and Supply&#13;
1.4   The main domestic energy resource of Hungary is coal. Reserves are estimated at 0.7&#13;
billion tons of hard coal (200 MM toe), 1.0 billion tons of brown coal (250 MM toe), and 3.0&#13;
billion tons of lignite (500 MM toe). Power generation utilities, now often integrated with the coal&#13;
mines, account for all the lignite production, and approximately 70% of the hard and brown coal&#13;
mined in Hungary. Most of the coal has a high sulfur and ash content, and low calorific value.&#13;
End- 1995 proven oil reserves are estimated at 10 MM toe (five years of production equivalent), and&#13;
gas reserves at about 38 MM toe (ten years of production). Uranium reserves at 7 million tons are&#13;
sufficient to meet the requirement of the PAKS nuclear power plant during its expected lifetime.&#13;
Hungary has very limited other energy resources including hydropower, low temperature&#13;
geothermal water, firewood and agricultural crop residues. Thus Hungary has to rely on imports to&#13;
meet much of its energy requirements:&#13;
Table 1.1: Energy Supply and Imports in 1995&#13;
(MM toe)&#13;
Domestic Production       Imports          Self Reliance (%)&#13;
Coal                         3.0                  1.0                 75%&#13;
Oil                          2.0                  7.2                 22%&#13;
Natural Gas                  4.0                  5.4                 42%&#13;
Source: Energy Balance (Annex 1.1).&#13;
In the aggregate, imports accounted for 48% of energy requirements in 1995. The share of&#13;
imports is bound to increase given the declining production of the coal mines, and the lack of&#13;
significant new petroleum discoveries.&#13;
C. Energy Demand&#13;
1.5    Over the 1990-95 period, energy demand declined from 29.1 MM toe to 25.0 MM toe.&#13;
However the fuel mix changed considerably during the period, with an increasing share going to oil&#13;
and gas, as follows:&#13;
Table 1.2: Trends in Energy Demand 1990 -1995&#13;

Natural Gas                      8.4         28.9            8.7          34.6&#13;
Primary Electricity             514           18.6           3.6          14.3&#13;

Energy intensity, at about 0.9 kg of oil equivalent (kgoe)/US$ of GNP in 1993 is still high by&#13;
international standards, and compares with 0.2 kgoe in neighboring Austria, 1.6 kgoe in Poland&#13;
and represents about triple the OECD average (0.3 kgoe). However, per capita energy use at 2.4 toe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
is still significantly lower than that in Western Europe. According to a recent forecast,I with an&#13;
economic growth rate of 2.8% per annum, energy demand could reach about 30 MM toe by 2000.&#13;
The increase in the share of natural gas, largely at the expense of coal, is expected to continue.&#13;
D. Energy Pricing&#13;
1.6   In recent years, the Government has liberalized imports and eliminated price controls on&#13;
coal and petroleum products. Significant sales taxes are in effect for gasoline and diesel oil.&#13;
Regarding the grid industries tariffs are regulated: (i) with respect to electric power and natural gas,&#13;
the Government sets the tariffs; and (ii) with respect to district heating, the Government sets the&#13;
producers prices (prices vary from plant to plant as they are cost-based) and the municipalities,&#13;
usually the owners of the distribution systems, the retail prices. Mid-1996 prices of oil products&#13;
and natural gas are at Annex 1.2.&#13;
E. Energy Institutions&#13;
1.7   The Ministry of Industry and Trade has overall responsibility for the sector's activities,&#13;
including the formulation of the national energy policy. Other Ministries concerned with the sector&#13;
include the Ministries of Finance and Environmental Protection. APV Rt (the Hungarian&#13;
Privatization and State Holding Company) holds the State's share in its enterprises, and is&#13;
entrusted with the privatization of the sector. The Hungarian Energy Office (HEO), created in&#13;
1994, is essentially entrusted with licensing the electric power and natural gas sectors, and prepares&#13;
tariff proposals in accordance with official guidelines; tariffs are subsequently  subject to&#13;
Government approval. It is anticipated that the Government's current responsibility for district&#13;
heating prices will be entrusted to HEO during 1997.&#13;
F. Government Sector Strategy&#13;
1.8   In recent years, the Government's strategy has been characterized by: (i) a lessening of the&#13;
State intervention in the sector; (ii) diversification of the mix of energy imports; (iii) price&#13;
liberalization; (iv) assertion of environmental priorities in the sector; (v) involvement of the public&#13;
in energy investment decisions; and (vi) improvements in energy efficiency. Considerable progress&#13;
has been achieved in the execution of the above strategy inter alia through the partial-privatization&#13;
of enterprises in the oil, gas and power sectors, by increasing tariffs significantly and by entrusting&#13;
regulatory functions in the sector to a Government agency (HEO), staffed by professionals.&#13;
1.9    An important feature of the above policy has been to integrate Hungary into the Western&#13;
European energy system, in preparation for joining the EU. In this respect, in the petroleum sector,&#13;
Hungary has adopted the strategic reserves policies for petroleum products in effect in the EU; in&#13;
the power sector, Hungary aims at integrating its network with UCPTE (the West European power&#13;
International Energy Agency - 1995 Survey of the Energy Policies of Hungary. The document is in the Project&#13;
File (Annex 7.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
pool) in order to adopt inter alia its reliability standards (frequency, voltage), and to benefit from&#13;
shared capacity reserves. The proposed Project aims at assisting Hungary meet the latter objective.&#13;
PART II. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
A. Legal Framework&#13;
2.1       Act XLVIII of 1994 sets the regime governing the power sector in Hungary. I Under the&#13;
Act, the Government establishes energy policy, and retains certain rights such as the approval&#13;
(through Parliament) of new power plants in excess of 600 MW and of fuels selection in new&#13;
plants in excess of 200 MW; and fixes the tariffs. The sector is regulated by the Hungarian Energy&#13;
Office (HEO), established under the Gas Supply Act.2 HEO is inter alia in charge of enforcing the&#13;
Electricity Act, approving the contractual framework, protecting consumers, issuing licenses and&#13;
administering those. The Act sets the principles under which electricity tariffs will be established&#13;
effective January 1, 1997 (i.e., recovery of reasonable investment and operating costs including&#13;
standby capacity, environment protection, decommissioning, safety etc.). While tariffs are&#13;
promulgated by the Government, their preparation and application are the responsibility of HEO.&#13;
B. Institutional Aspects&#13;
2.2       The Hungarian power sector has undergone considerable restructuring in recent years.&#13;
Until 1991, the MVM Trust constituted an integrated utility with a dominant role in the sector.&#13;
Effective 1992, MVM was established as a holding company, with 15 subsidiaries (a nuclear power&#13;
plant - PAKS, 7 conventional generators, 6 distributors, one transmission operation and&#13;
maintenance company - OVIT), most of which were jointly owned with the State (through APV&#13;
Rt). During 1995-96: (i) the six distribution companies together with three conventional generation&#13;
companies were partially privatized; and (ii) MVM swapped shares in the distribution companies&#13;
against shares in PAKS (the nuclear power plant) and OVIT (the transmission maintenance&#13;
company). As a result, MVM is for all practical purposes the full owner of PAKS and OVIT, and&#13;
retains shares in seven conventional generators. During 1997, the Government will attempt to: (i)&#13;
privatize the remaining four conventional generators; and (ii) sell part of its stake in MVM (the&#13;
Government has decided to retain majority control over MVM). A Government Resolution3&#13;
provides that MVM will dispose of all of its shares in the generators by the end of 1998 (other than&#13;
PAKS and secondary reserves). Annex 2.1 describes the reform program in more detail.&#13;
2.3       MVM  plays a central role in the power sector being entrusted with transmission,&#13;
dispatch, and generation planning. In this capacity, it buys power from the generators under long&#13;
term contractual arrangements, ensures that the safety and reliability standards of the network are&#13;
complied with, and sells power to the distributors under similar long term arrangements. MVM is&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
also in charge of power trading with neighboring countries. The relationships between the different&#13;
operators in the sector are largely influenced by the Electricity Act and are spelled out in detail in&#13;
an Operational Code which was approved by HEO.&#13;
C. Existing Power Facilities&#13;
2.4      Installed power generating capacity is 7,350 MW (Annex 2.2) broken down as follows:&#13;
nuclear (1,840 MW); oil and gas fired steam plants (2,983 MW); coal fired plants, some of which&#13;
can bum oil or gas (1,985 MW); gas turbines (494 MW); and hydro (48 MW). The gross installed&#13;
and available capacity of autoproducers are 186 MW and 170 MW respectively. Taking into&#13;
account imports and deratings, the total available capacity is 7,427 MW, providing a satisfactory&#13;
reserve margin of 27% over the estimated maximum demand in 1996 (5,850 MW). Typical values&#13;
of the spinning reserve in the past three years with reference to the daily peak period are: 220 MW&#13;
for 1993 and 1994; and 310 MW for 1995. System reliability has increased noticeably in recent&#13;
years, as a result of the extensive plant rehabilitation and modernization carried out by MVM in&#13;
preparation for interconnecting to the UCPTE system at end-1995. As shown in Annex 2.3,&#13;
MVM's annual power system blackouts decreased from 21 events in 1991 to nil over 1992-1995.&#13;
2.5      The annual plant load factor of the four 460-MW  nuclear power units (of the&#13;
pressurized water reactor type known as VVER 440) at PAKS, brought on line in 1983-1987, is in&#13;
the 81-85% range; this level of utilization is comparable to some of the best OECD units. By all&#13;
known accounts, PAKS' safety record is excellent. Most of the oil and gas fired steam plants were&#13;
comrnissioned in the mid-i 970s and operate with satisfactory thermal efficiencies and at acceptable&#13;
levels of forced outage rates. The majority of the coal fired plants, which date back to the 1950s&#13;
and 1960s, have high operating costs,' and emit considerable amounts of pollutants. With the&#13;
exception of Matrai, an 800 MW coal fired plant partially refurbished in the late 1980s under the&#13;
Bank's First Power Project and operating satisfactorily, nearly all other coal fired power plants will&#13;
be retired over 2001-2005 (Annex 2.4). Some of MVM's gas turbine units were installed in the&#13;
early 1970s and are nearing the end of their useful lives. Consumption of power station auxiliaries&#13;
is equivalent to about 8% of gross generation. Given the type and age of the equipment, this level&#13;
is acceptable.&#13;
2.6      The Hungarian transmission system totals about 5,530 km of lines. Of these, 260 km&#13;
are rated 750 kV; 1,595 km, 400 kV; 1,190 km, 220 kV; and 2,535 km, 120 kV. Transmission and&#13;
distribution losses at less than 12% of the net electricity delivered are considered satisfactory.&#13;
Transmission networks outages have been reduced in recent years from 104 in 1991 to only 3 in&#13;
1995.&#13;
In mid-1996 coal-fired generators sold power to MVM typically at US¢5-8/kWh. On the other hand, the&#13;
average cost of energy purchases was US03.3/kWh - this is due to the contribution of nuclear, and oil/gas&#13;
fired plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. The Power Market&#13;
2.7      Final consumption of electric energy declined at the beginning of the decade, but is&#13;
now on an upward trend, consistent with the increase in economic activity. The trends in the power&#13;
market can be summarized as follows:&#13;
Table 2.1: Trends in Demand (TWh)&#13;
Year       1991     1992     1993     1994     1995 1991-95&#13;
Household      9.8     10.5      9.7      9.8      9.8      0%&#13;
Industrial    11.7      10.7    10.7     11.0     11.6      0%&#13;
Other          9.4      8.5      8.1      7.91     7.6     -5%&#13;
Total        30.9     29.7     28.5     28.7     29.0     -2%&#13;
Source: MVM&#13;
As can be seen from the above table, overall demand declined from 1991 to 1995, almost entirely&#13;
on account of "other" consumers (agriculture, commerce, etc.). Demands from households and&#13;
industry bottomed out in 1993 and recovered by 1995 to 1991 levels. The upward trend&#13;
continued during 1996.&#13;
E. Future Demand/Supply Balance&#13;
2.8      Demand. For system  planning purposes, every two years MVM  prepares, in&#13;
cooperation with other agencies, long-term electricity demand projections. The most recent study&#13;
(June 1995) forecasts gross electricity consumption (including station use and grid losses) under a&#13;
low and a high scenario. A medium forecast was subsequently added, which is considered the most&#13;
likely, or base-case, outcome. Under all cases, the demand recovery, which has been underway&#13;
since 1992, is seen to be sustained throughout 1996-2010. In the base case, the annual increase in&#13;
consumption is 1.1% from 1995 to 2000 and 1.8% from 2001 to 2010 (Annex 2.5). The historical&#13;
peak of 40.7 TWh (1989) is to be attained again in 2003. The predicted demand in 2010, at 46.0&#13;
TWh, stands about 25% higher than the level registered in 1995. This is a realistic forecast, given&#13;
anticipated changes in the level and sectoral mix of Hungary's total economic output during the&#13;
projection period.&#13;
2.9      Supply. MVM  recently completed a long-term expansion plan which is awaiting&#13;
approval by the Government; it is based on the medium demand scenario under which electricity&#13;
generation is envisaged to grow faster than domestic consumption due to the planned further&#13;
reduction of imports (from 3.5 TWh in 1995 to 1.8 TWh in 2000). Gross generation is seen to&#13;
increase from 34.0 TWh in 1995 to 38.1 TWh in 2000 and 45.6 TWh in 2010. Consequently, self-&#13;
sufficiency in electricity is to rise from the historical low of 72% in 1990 to as high as 96% in 2000&#13;
and 99% in 2010. The nearly complete phase-out of imports seems to be driven largely by supply&#13;
security and political considerations. Further details of past and future electricity balances are&#13;
given in Annex 2.5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
F. Tariffs&#13;
2.10       MVM buys power in bulk from the generators at a tariff which reflects the specific cost&#13;
of generation of each power plant - given the plants mix, they vary significantly. On the other hand,&#13;
MVM applies uniform wholesale tariffs to all the distributors so that it acts as a pool. The retail&#13;
tariffs (to the final consumers) are also uniform, so that the profitability of the different distributors&#13;
is affected not only by their relative efficiency, but also by their consumers' mix and other&#13;
considerations. Until 1996, the bulk and wholesale tariffs were determined by MVM, and the retail&#13;
(consumer) tariffs by the Ministry of Trade and Industry by way of a decree. The Government set&#13;
bulk sales tariffs for the generators for the first time in early 1996.&#13;
2.11       Retail tariffs were increased in October 1995, and March 1996, on average by 8% and&#13;
18%  respectively to reach an average of US05.0/kWh (excluding the 12%  VAT).  Despite&#13;
significant increases in recent years, through 1996 they were not, on the whole, sufficient to cover&#13;
costs and generate an adequate return on investment. Furthermore, tariffs continued to contain&#13;
significant distortions - for instance the capacity charge of the generators to MVM is considerably&#13;
above that of MVM to the distributors, which is itself often above that charged to ultimate&#13;
consumers (the deficit is recovered through considerably higher energy fees). Furthermore, the&#13;
tariffs to households do not reflect the true cost of supply. Additional details on the tariff structure&#13;
are at Annex 2.1.&#13;
2.12       The basis for setting up tariffs underwent a considerable change in early 1997 as the&#13;
provisions of the Electricity Act came into effect. A Government Decree provided inter alia that&#13;
new tariffs would be introduced on October 1, 1996 consistent with the requirements of the Act,&#13;
and would allow the generators (individually), the transmitter, and the distributors (taken as a&#13;
group), to recover costs (including depreciation on a partially revalued basis), additional expenses&#13;
(environmental costs, interest, insurance, land reclamation, decommissioning) as well as generate&#13;
an 8% return on proportional equity.3 HEO carried out the cost review in the summer of 1996 and&#13;
concluded that the retail tariffs should, on average, be increased by about 35% to enable the&#13;
different utilities to attain their financial targets. Such increases were deemed too high; tariffs were&#13;
not increased on October 1 in accordance with the Decree, and the Government decided in&#13;
December 1996 to raise retail tariffs on January 1, 1997 by 24.9% only. The reduction came&#13;
through various measures, including deferments of the date at which MVM, PAKS and OVIT will&#13;
be entitled to earn an 8% return.4 It is anticipated that from 1997 onwards, tariffs will be adjusted&#13;
Households consumer tariffs have increased between 1991 and 1996 by 160-200% (depending on the&#13;
consumption tranche) - the increase is less pronounced in US$ terms -- 20-30%. Tariff increases for&#13;
industrial consumers were also significant, yet not of the same magnitude.&#13;
2      Decree 63/1995 a copy of which is in the Project File (Annex 7.1).&#13;
3      Proportional equity stands for equity times the share of fixed assets which are recognized as used and&#13;
useful in electricity operations.&#13;
Other measures to reduce the immediate increase have been to postpone the creation of certain reserves&#13;
(for decommissioning of PAKS, for closing coal mines, for strategic reserves of fuels etc.), and the non&#13;
recognition of certain expenses (insurance, proper disposal of contaminated materials, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
on a quarterly basis, and that costs presently disallowed will be gradually introduced in the tariffs,&#13;
as further adjustments take place. It is also anticipated that the mid-1997 tariffrevision will address&#13;
the present distortions in the structure of the tariffs (para. 2.11).  In this respect, the continuing&#13;
privatization drive will encourage the timely adjustment of tariffs.&#13;
2.13      Several foreign investors in Hungarian utilities have expressed displeasure at the&#13;
recent decisions regarding tariffs, which, they claim, do not conform to earlier undertakings.&#13;
During negotiations, the authorities confirmed that Hungary will take all necessary measures to&#13;
resolve any possible dispute. Furthermore, investors are entitled, in case they consider it&#13;
necessary, to legal recourse in accordance with existing laws, and to arbitration in accordance&#13;
with existing contracts.&#13;
G. Role of the Bank&#13;
2.14      The Bank has been associated with Hungary's reform program since it began, and is&#13;
currently active in the design and implementation of the second phase of structural reforms&#13;
which focus on: macroeconomic stability with accelerated growth to facilitate EU accession;&#13;
strengthening and privatization of financial sector and public enterprises; social policy reform;&#13;
improved environmental management; and attracting private infrastructure finance and&#13;
investments. Since 1983, the Bank has made seven loans for energy related activities in Hungary,&#13;
including two for the development of hydrocarbon resources; three for energy conservation, and&#13;
two for power projects.I An Implementation Completion Report was recently submitted for the&#13;
2.&#13;
First Power Project; in general terms, project implementation was successful, although a delay was&#13;
experienced because of a significant change in the project scope. The institutional building and&#13;
strengthening goals were also attained. Particularly in recent years, difficulties have emerged in&#13;
ensuring compliance with the financial covenants. This is notably the case of the Dunamenti power&#13;
plant, a sub-borrower under the second power project, whose financial performance has not been&#13;
consistent with agreed targets. This is generally due to conflicting national priorities during the&#13;
painful process of adjustment of the Hungarian economy to realistic energy price levels.&#13;
Nevertheless, price adjustments in recent years have been significant, and the new framework (para.&#13;
2.12), once fully implemented, will provide a sound basis for the financial recovery of the sector as&#13;
tariffs will be set on the basis of financial and economic criteria.&#13;
2.15      In recent years, the Bank has been supportive of the Government's efforts to restructure&#13;
the power sector and the subsequent privatization of power utilities, which has so far yielded about&#13;
US$1.5 billion (for about a third of the sector's assets). The proposed Project fits well into the&#13;
Bank's program of cooperation with Hungary and would make an important contribution to&#13;
achieving several of the key objectives of our current assistance strategy. Specifically, the&#13;
Project would help ensure the financial soundness of MVM which in turn would facilitate its&#13;
partial privatization, together with that of its subsidiaries. The strategic functions of MVM&#13;
(transmission and dispatch) are expected to remain public sector owned, although a partial&#13;
Loan 2697-HU of May 20, 1986 and Loan 3705-HU of February 17, 1994.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
privatization is being planned. MVM and the Government requested the Bank to participate in the&#13;
proposed Project given the Bank's familiarity with the power sector, their need to have the Project&#13;
implemented urgently to meet commitments to UCPTE, and to take advantage of international&#13;
competitive bidding. Investments to improve system efficiency and reliability constitute acceptable&#13;
public sector investments until partial privatization takes place. The timing of such privatization is&#13;
uncertain, and will depend inter alia on the pace at which the remaining generators are privatized&#13;
(para. 2.2). The Project would allow Hungary to meet the stringent supply reliability standards set&#13;
by West European utilities. In this respect, the Bank has consistently supported the integration of&#13;
the CENTREL member countries into the UCPTE network. Terms of Reference for in-depth&#13;
interconnection studies were offered by the Bank to the relevant European Union and OECD&#13;
committees in 1992-93. Thus, by participating in the financing of this Project, the Bank would&#13;
underscore its long standing support to a sound power sector reform and regional integration&#13;
program, which is entering its final stages, and respond to the urgent needs of a long-standing and&#13;
good client. The Bank would also be in a position to assist in the introduction of a commercial&#13;
framework for transmission operations, which would otherwise run the risk of being squeezed&#13;
between privatized distributors and generators.&#13;
PART III. THE BORROWER&#13;
A. Corporate Objectives&#13;
3.1      MVM is still in a transition phase from a fully integrated utility in charge of the whole&#13;
sector, to a transmission-dispatch-planning company operating in a commercial environment in&#13;
conjunction with a large number of private entities. In addition, HEO, a new agency (para. 1.7),&#13;
will have an important influence on the sector's operations in general and MVM's activities in&#13;
particular. The introduction of the new regulatory framework has been done in a remarkably short&#13;
period and MVM is adapting itself to its new role. In addition to acting as the network operator and&#13;
supplier of secondary reserves to the system, MVM aims at becoming an important player in the&#13;
North-South and East-West electricity trade. In this respect, it assigns priority to strengthening the&#13;
interconnections with neighboring countries (including Ukraine, with which it used to trade power),&#13;
and creating additional services (such as in telecommunications in order to fully utilize its existing&#13;
capacity required for system control). The investment strategy of MVM is consistent with the&#13;
above.&#13;
B. Legal Framework&#13;
3.2      MVM is a fully owned Government company -- APV Rt holds 99.8% of its shares, and&#13;
the balance is held by municipalities. The main organs of MVM are the General Assembly of&#13;
shareholders, the Supervisory Board, and the Board of Directors. The General Assembly meets at&#13;
least once a year, approves major decisions affecting the company particularly on ownership&#13;
matters, approves the annual accounts, and inter alia appoints the members of the Supervisory&#13;
Board (except employee representatives), and the Board of Directors. The Supervisory Board has&#13;
presently 6 members, including one elected by the personnel; in general terms, it oversees the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
management of the company, including the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of MVM&#13;
presently has 11 members, including the Chief Executive Officer. Most of the Board Members&#13;
occupy senior positions in Government or in industry, and several have occupied high positions in&#13;
the power sector in the past. The Board meets about 11 times per annum, and sets company policy.&#13;
3.3      MVM holds the exclusive License granted by HEO to transmit electricity in Hungary.'&#13;
The license stipulates how MVM is to operate and maintain the power system, its obligations to&#13;
generators and distributors, its role in the planning process, the conditions under which it can trade&#13;
electricity internationally, how its books and records should be maintained, and its reporting&#13;
obligations to HEO.&#13;
C. Organization, Management and Staffing&#13;
3.4      As the organization chart (Annex 3.1) indicates, MVM is organized into four main&#13;
operational units, entrusted with Finance, Strategic Development, System Dispatch and&#13;
Administration. In addition the Public Relations Department (which also acts as a secretariat to the&#13;
Board), the Internal Auditor and the Nuclear Power Station Secretariat also report to the Managing&#13;
Director. The organization set-up is adequate, given MVM's scope of activities.&#13;
3.5      MVM is contracting out to OVIT, a subsidiary, the operation and maintenance functions&#13;
(but not dispatch) of the transmission system. As a result, MVM employs a relatively small&#13;
number of staff (about 450), of which about 50% are employed by the Technical Department and&#13;
the balance in the Economic Department (25%) and the Administrative unit (20%). The staff is&#13;
highly educated, as nearly half has a university degree, and a similar proportion has a secondary&#13;
degree.&#13;
3.6      In recent years, as a result of the restructuring of the sector, and the ensuing downsizing&#13;
of MVM, the personnel management function in general and the training function in particular have&#13;
been somehow neglected, particularly in the areas of general management, human resources, and in&#13;
the commercial/financial functions.2 In this respect, MVM has recently prepared a comprehensive&#13;
training program addressing particularly the needs of senior and middle level staff with a strong&#13;
emphasis on managerial sciences, and financial management. MVM staff will be trained in-house&#13;
and at various international education centers. The cost of the program, the bulk of which is to be&#13;
implemented over 1997-98, has been estimated at US$1 million.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audit&#13;
3.7      MVM keeps its accounts in accordance with the Hungarian Accounting Law (HAL)&#13;
which became effective on January 1, 1992.3 In addition, MVM has its own code of accounts which&#13;
A copy of the License is in the Project File (Annex 7. 1).&#13;
2     Under the outstanding Bank Loan (Loan 3705-HU), training is provided in the operation of the new&#13;
dispatch system.&#13;
3     The restatement of MVM's 1994 accounts (in connection with an Offering Memorandum) on the basis of&#13;
International Accounting Standards (IAS) has resulted in minor corrections overall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
is updated on an annual basis, and which is also applicable to the affiliates. MVM has budgeting&#13;
and budgetary control systems, together with periodic monitoring of financial performance and&#13;
results. The different systems are not integrated. However implementation of such a system has&#13;
been initiated in April 1996 and is expected to be completed in the Fall of 1997.&#13;
3.8      Annual audited accounts of MVM are produced on a timely basis (within four months&#13;
from the end of the fiscal year), but this is not the case for the consolidated accounts (which are&#13;
produced within 9 months). In recent years, the auditor's reports have been unqualified, with one&#13;
reservation regarding the absence of an independent environmental audit.' During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that MVM will continue to have its accounts audited, by auditors&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, and that such audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later than&#13;
June 15 for MVM; in the case of the consolidated accounts, these should be submitted not later&#13;
than August 31 for FYI 996, July 31 for FY 1997, and June 15 from FY 1998 onwards. In addition,&#13;
since HAL does not require the submission of a Sources and Applications of Funds Statement,&#13;
agreement was reached that the audited accounts will incorporate a Sources and Applications of&#13;
Funds Statement in a format satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
E. Insurance&#13;
3.9      MVM does not insure its assets externally against major risks, so that it practices self&#13;
insurance. This has been the practice in the Hungarian power industry in recent years. However,&#13;
MVM's license requires that adequate measures for the insurance of assets be taken, and such an&#13;
expense will be recognized in due course (para. 2.12). MVM intends to insure its assets&#13;
accordingly. In any event, with respect to the gas turbines to be financed under the Loan, these&#13;
will be insured as considered prudent under the circumstances. During negotiations, agreement&#13;
was reached that MVM will insure its assets in accordance with appropriate practices satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. In addition, as majority owner of PAKS, MVM runs a significant potential liability.&#13;
To mitigate this risk, the Government confirmed during negotiations that it will hold MVM&#13;
harmless from any claim related to nuclear power generation at PAKS.&#13;
PART IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objective&#13;
4.1      One of the main objectives of the Hungarian energy policy in the 1990s is the&#13;
interconnection of the Hungarian power system with the Western European power pool (UCPTE),&#13;
to ensure a desirable level of security of supply at the lowest possible cost.  As a first step in the&#13;
process of interconnection, MVM joined the Polish, Czech and Slovak power companies to form&#13;
the Central European Power Pool (CENTREL) in the fall of 1992. On October 18, 1995,&#13;
A comprehensive independent environmental audit of MVM (and the generators) was initiated in 1995,&#13;
and has been largely completed. .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
CENTREL joined UCPTE on a trial basis, and the two systems have been operating in parallel ever&#13;
since.&#13;
4.2      The objective of the Project is thus to provide about 200 MW of generation reserve&#13;
capacity to enable Hungary to maintain a level of reliability and security of supply in line with&#13;
international standards. Under UCPTE's operating rules, each member company is responsible for&#13;
providing sufficient primary control reserves (immediate response) and secondary control reserves&#13;
(within-15-minutes response) of generating capacity to maintain system frequency and restore&#13;
scheduled tie-line flows ( export-import balance) in the event of the loss of its largest unit. In the&#13;
Hungarian power system, the largest generating units are the 460-MW units at PAKS nuclear&#13;
power station. In the event of the loss of one of these units, only about 100 MW can be supplied&#13;
from the Hungarian system's own available spinning reserve capacity. The remaining 360 MW&#13;
required must come from imports (about 160 MW) and 200 MW of new domestic power plants.&#13;
MVM's feasibility studies indicate that the quick start gas turbine power plants in the proposed&#13;
project are the least cost means of supplying the 200 MW of required domestic generating capacity.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
4.3      The proposed project consists of two complete single cycle gas turbine power plants&#13;
rated at about 110 MW each, burning light distillate fuel oil. The plants will consist of the&#13;
following fully integrated components:&#13;
Main equipment&#13;
* Gas turbine and generator sets and auxiliaries, air inlet and exhaust gas systems,&#13;
including stacks;&#13;
* Electrical equipment, as required to serve the plants' needs;&#13;
* Power plant control system;&#13;
* High voltage switchgear and unit transformers, to connect the generator sets to the&#13;
120-kV system;&#13;
* Enclosures and light structure buildings to accommodate the gas turbine units and&#13;
auxiliaries.&#13;
Auxiliary Systems&#13;
* Fuel supply system, including unloading facilities, oil storage tanks, and pumping&#13;
stations and piping;&#13;
Demineralized water supply for make-up cooling water and de-NOx system;&#13;
* Water supply for fire extinguishing system;&#13;
* Fire detection and protection system;&#13;
* Telecommunications and remote control and indication systems.&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
* site preparation, leveling and earthwork;&#13;
* foundations for main equipment enclosures and buildings;&#13;
* foundations for auxiliary equipment and storage tanks;&#13;
* roads and fences;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
* site improvements, cable and piping channels and trenches.&#13;
Network and infrastructure&#13;
* telecommunications link to integrate the plant with MVM's energy management&#13;
system (EMS/SCADA).&#13;
4.4        One of the plants will be installed at Liter in western Hungary and the other at&#13;
Sajoszoged in the eastern part of the country (Map IBRD 27991). Both power plants will be&#13;
designed for unattended operation and quick starting capability, i.e., from standstill to full load in&#13;
no more than 10 minutes total elapsed time. The plants are intended for standby duty to provide an&#13;
adequate level of own secondary reserve for the Hungarian power system operating in parallel with&#13;
the UCPTE member systems. It is anticipated the plants will be called upon to start 10-20 times a&#13;
year and run some 2 hours per start.&#13;
4.5        Although fully owned by MVM, operation and maintenance of the plants will be&#13;
provided by generators in the vicinity under long-term contractual arrangements.&#13;
C. Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
4.6        The estimated project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest&#13;
during construction but excluding duties and taxes, is US$96.1 million equivalent, of which&#13;
US$63.9 million is in foreign exchange. The cost estimate reflects 1996 prices and is based on&#13;
recent inquiries in Hungary and abroad for similar type installations. Physical contingencies were&#13;
included at 10%. Price contingencies on foreign cost were derived from anticipated international&#13;
inflation, i.e. 2.3% annually over 1997-1998. Price contingencies on local costs were derived from&#13;
anticipated domestic inflation rates, i.e. 13.0% for 1997 and 9.0% for 1998. The estimated costs&#13;
are summarized in Table 4.1 below, and the detailed cost estimates are shown in Annex 4.1.&#13;

4.7       The proposed Bank loan of US$ 60.0 million would finance about 62% of the total&#13;
project cost, or about 94% of the foreign exchange requirements, as follows:&#13;
(a)   supply and installation of the gas turbine generator sets; and&#13;
(b)   supply and installation of the power transformers, protective relaying and&#13;
switchgear required for the complete 120-kV step-up substations.&#13;

The loan would be guaranteed by the Governnent of Hungary, and MVM would carry the foreign&#13;
exchange risk.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
4.10      The single cycle gas turbine generator sets and step-up substations for both plant sites,&#13;
Liter and Sajoszoged, are being procured through a single-responsibility contract based on the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Supply and Installation of Plant and Equipment of January&#13;
1996. The above contract will include all cost elements necessary to supply a complete system, i.e.,&#13;
engineering design, equipment manufacture and delivery, instrumentation and control, installation&#13;
(including related civil works), testing and commissioning. Preliminary design, site preparation&#13;
and miscellaneous civil works, and supply and installation of fuel supply and other auxiliary&#13;
systems will be done by others.&#13;
4.11      All equipment and materials financed from the proposed Bank loan are being procured&#13;
in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement of January 1995. Main equipment for the&#13;
plants and substations (about 80% of the total cost of the project) are being procured through&#13;
intemational competitive bidding (ICB). Supply and installation of the fuel supply facilities, water&#13;
supply and firefighting stations are well within the capabilities of local contractors and&#13;
manufacturers; these contracts will be financed by MVM and awarded through competitive&#13;
bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank, to ensure cost effective reserved procurement with no&#13;
adverse effects on project implementation.&#13;
Discussions have been held with EU-Phare on their possible participation in the Project, but have not been&#13;
concluded so far. Should EU-Phare financing materialize, it will reduce MVM's participation in the&#13;
financing of the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15-&#13;
4.12      Project components and their estimated cost and proposed procurement arrangements&#13;
are summarized in Table 4.3. A detailed procurement schedule is shown in Annex 4.2. All&#13;
procurement documents for contracts financed by the Bank and estimated to cost more than US$1.0&#13;
million equivalent will be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. The procedure is&#13;
expected to cover 100% of the amount of the proposed Bank loan.&#13;

E. Project Preparation&#13;
4.13      Project preparation is well advanced. A detailed feasibility study was completed in&#13;
February, 1995. The study was carried out by MVM's Development Department with the help of&#13;
local consultants, ERBE Energetika (an MVM subsidiary), after approval of the project's&#13;
conceptual design by MVM's Board of Directors in February 1994. The feasibility report was&#13;
updated in February 1996. The report is comprehensive and covers adequately all project&#13;
preparation aspects, including inter alia selection of appropriate technology through comparison of&#13;
alternatives, plant conceptual design, site selection and soil mechanics and seismic conditions,&#13;
environmental aspects, network interconnection considerations, preliminary cost estimates based on&#13;
extensive canvassing of potential major equipment suppliers, and proposed implementation&#13;
arrangements and rnilestones.' The project's licensing process required under the Electricity Act is&#13;
well underway. The Hungarian Electricity Office issued the preliminary construction license for&#13;
the Liter and Sajoszoged plants in November, 1995. The last major licenses, related to the&#13;
environmental aspects of the plants were submitted late November/early December 1996. All land&#13;
and land rights for the project have been secured.&#13;
A copy of the Feasibility Study is in the Project File (Annex 7. 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
F. Project Implementation&#13;
4.14     Project management will be carried out by MVM with the help of local consultants,&#13;
ERBE Energetika, in a manner similar to the successful arrangements followed in previous Bank&#13;
assisted MVM projects. A proposed project organization chart is shown in Annex 4.3. ERBE&#13;
Energetika is a competent engineering consultant firm well qualified to carry out the tasks being&#13;
entrusted to it, namely: (i) the full range of commercial and technical implementation of the main&#13;
equipment contract; (ii) technical implementation of the balance-of-plant contracts; (iii)&#13;
rendering certain other project services; and (iv) coordinating all contracts awarded by MVM&#13;
under the project.&#13;
4.15     Procurement for major equipment packages is well underway. In line with the tight&#13;
implementation schedule planned by MVM -- 14 months from start to finish -- , a General&#13;
Procurement Notice was published in the May 31 issue of Development Business. Given the large&#13;
size of the gas turbine generator contract --about US$70 million, a Specific Procurement Notice for&#13;
it was also published in the same issue of Development Business, in line with Bank procedures.&#13;
Bidding documents were issued on June 16, 1996 with a closing date on September 16, 1996. The&#13;
contract is expected to be awarded in March, 1997. Details of the project implementation schedule&#13;
are shown in Annex 4.4.&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
4.16     The Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for&#13;
directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a CIF basis; (b) 100% of local expenditures&#13;
ex-factory for locally manufactured items; and (c) 75% of the cost of other items procured locally.&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to US$7.5 million (12.5% of the proposed Loan amount) would be&#13;
allowed, to provide for reimbursement of the 10% advance payment due upon signing the main&#13;
equipment contract.&#13;
4.17     Annex 4.5 shows the disbursement schedule for the proposed loan as well as a standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for the energy sector in the ECA Region. Because of its fast track&#13;
implementation, and the use of a single package for which bids have already been invited, the&#13;
disbursement schedule for the proposed project is anticipated to be much faster than the standard&#13;
disbursement profile. The Bank loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1998. The&#13;
loan closing date is June 30, 1999.&#13;
H. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.18     MVM will furnish to the Bank regular quarterly project progress reports each year,&#13;
covering technical progress, financial and other relevant matters. As part of the overall reporting&#13;
requirements, brief summaries of the environmental status of the Liter and Sajoszoged power plants&#13;
are to be provided. During negotiations, agreement was reached regarding the timing and contents&#13;
of the Progress Reports. Details of the Supervision Plan for the project are shown in Annex 4.6.&#13;
Proposed performance indicators are at Annex 4.7.&#13;

I. Environmental Considerations&#13;
4.19     Environmental Assessment. In accordance with Bank procedures, the Project was&#13;
rated Category A so that separate environmental assessments (EAs) were prepared for the units at&#13;
Liter and Sajoszoged - the Government of Hungary has similar requirement. The EAs were&#13;
approved by the appropriate Hungarian authorities and meet World Bank requirements. An&#13;
executive summary of the EAs is at Annex 4.8.&#13;
4.20     Air Pollution. Air quality in both areas are within both Hungarian standards and&#13;
World Bank guidelines with respect to dust, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. With project&#13;
implementation, air quality levels will still remain with Hungarian standards and World Bank&#13;
guidelines as: (i) the fuel utilized will be a low sulfur (0.2 per cent light distillate oil); and (ii)&#13;
both units will be operated for very short intervals over the year. Emission levels for dust,&#13;
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide will meet both Hungarian standards and World Bank&#13;
guidelines. Dust and sulfur dioxide emission limits will be met by fuel choice, nitrogen oxide&#13;
limits will be met by burner design.&#13;
4.21     Noise. All units will be required to meet acceptable noise emission limits as specified&#13;
in the bid documents. A summary of ambient noise level characteristics for the project is&#13;
presented below:&#13;

4.22     As the table above indicates, the background noise level at Liter slightly exceeds the&#13;
strict Hungarian standard during the day. Nonetheless, environmental authorities granted their&#13;
approval since the incremental noise level would not be significant. Project implementation is&#13;
not expected to add measurable increases to existing noise levels.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached that MVM will implement the monitoring program specified in the&#13;
environmental assessment dated June 6, 1996, and take proper action to monitor noise levels.&#13;
4.23     Oil Storage. Storage of petroleum products always involves a risk of fire. However,&#13;
MVM confirmed at negotiations that: (i) storage facilities will be designed and constructed in&#13;
accordance with internationally accepted practices; (ii) adequate equipment, alarms and&#13;
emergency procedures will be introduced to ensure rapid and effective response, and (iii)&#13;
insurance companies have evaluated the safety measures and found them adequate.&#13;
4.24     Monitoring. Flue gases will be monitored for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot,&#13;
carbon monoxide, oxygen (or carbon dioxide) , temperature, and volumetric flow rate. In&#13;
addition, the Borrower has agreed to monitor ambient noise levels.&#13;
4.25     Public Consultation. Public meetings were held at both sites. An inter-agency&#13;
government commission concluded that: (i) the public meetings were properly conducted; (ii)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18 -&#13;
local communities were not opposed to the proposed project; and (iii) MVM provided&#13;
satisfactory responses to all concerns raised by the affected groups.&#13;
J. Project Risks&#13;
4.26     The Project's technical risks are minimal. MVM has done thorough investigations prior&#13;
to selecting the sites and power plant ratings. Extensive canvassing of potential manufacturers of&#13;
gas turbine generator sets and step-up substation equipment with ratings similar to the requirements&#13;
of the Project yielded valuable technical data which was incorporated in the bid documents.&#13;
Procurement of the main equipment package, made-up mostly of factory-assembled components&#13;
readily available in the market under a single responsibility contract, should facilitate Project&#13;
coordination and ensure its timely completion. Site investigations, including soil mechanics&#13;
analysis and plant layout have been carefully executed. Access roads and transportation facilities&#13;
are readily available at both sites. Procurement of main equipment to be financed by the Bank is&#13;
underway, and bid opening has taken place already, thus reducing the risk of cost overruns&#13;
considerably. On the environmental side, there is some risk that at Liter, where the pre-existing&#13;
nioise levels slightly exceeds the standards, the relevant regional authority refuses to issue the final&#13;
environmental permit, if measurements during start-up operations show a perceptible incremental&#13;
contribution to noise levels. However this risk is manageable given MVM's willingness to include&#13;
in the final project design additional noise suppression measures (e.g. tree lines or noise absorbing&#13;
walls).&#13;
PART V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Financial Performance 1993-95&#13;
5.1      MVM maintains its books in accordance with the Hungarian Accounting Law (HAL) of&#13;
1992. As mentioned above (para. 3.7), the 1994 accounts were restated in accordance with IAS,&#13;
and the differences were not significant. Nevertheless, this should be taken into account when&#13;
evaluating MVM's financial performance. An important feature of HAL is that, notwithstanding&#13;
the high rates of inflation in recent years, MVM has not been allowed to revalue its assets since&#13;
1992, at which time they were partially revalued. This also applies to the depreciation provisions&#13;
which are correspondingly understated.&#13;
5.2      MVM's financial performance in recent years is particularly complex to analyze given&#13;
its multiple roles: (i) MVM owns and operates (through a subsidiary) the transmission and dispatch&#13;
system, and owns and operates (through contractors) system reserves; (ii) MWM imports and buys&#13;
power from generators, and exports and sells power to distributors (i.e. electricity trading); (iii)&#13;
MVM acts as a holding company for significant assets in the power sector; (iv) MVM borrows long&#13;
term on behalf of its affiliates, and onlends the proceeds (financial intermediation); and (v) MVM&#13;
provides short term advances to generation and distribution utilities to finance their working capital&#13;
requirements. Each of these functions implies different levels of risks. The assessment is further&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
complicated by the ongoing restructuring of the sector in general and the ongoing privatization&#13;
drive in particular, whose outcome is uncertain at this juncture.&#13;
5.3        The financial results of MVM  over 1993-95 appear at Annex 5.1. Converted to US$,&#13;
they can be summarized as follows:&#13;

Average Exchange Rate (HFt/US$)             92        106       125&#13;
The income statements above call for the following comments: (i) the electricity trading business&#13;
operates on extremely thin margins (6-9%) - this is a regulated activity; (ii) the volume of sales has&#13;
been declining in recent years - this is due to some distributors buying power directly from&#13;
cogeneration plants; (iii) MVM incurred a huge loss in 1995 (US$463 million), on account of a&#13;
swap of shares it held in the distributors against the shares held by APV Rt in PAKS and OVIT (the&#13;
transmission subsidiary). The apparent objective of the swap was to enable the Government to&#13;
collect the proceeds of the privatization of the distributors (para. 2.2), and prepare MVM for its&#13;
partial privatization. Under these circumstances, the 1995 losses are understandable - without the&#13;
equity transaction, MVM would have made a profit of US$15 million during the year.&#13;
5.4        MVM's Balance Sheets can be summarized as follows:&#13;
&#13;

Year-end Exchange Rate           101          111            139&#13;
As can be seen above, MVM displays a strong balance sheet with a low level of long term debt and&#13;
acceptable (though declining) liquidity levels. Important features are as follows: (i) electricity assets&#13;
are small in relation to MVM's investment portfolio; (ii) MVM has made more loans to its affiliates&#13;
than it has borrowed; (iii) its accounts receivable are minimal given that there were daily&#13;
settlements within the Hungarian power system; and (iv) MVM's liquidity has deteriorated largely&#13;
on account of increasing short term borrowing (as of December 31, these stood at HFt 17 billion or&#13;
US$130 million) made to finance advances to related utilities (equivalent to HFt 15 billion on the&#13;
same date). While these advances were profitable to MVM, they will be phased out by March&#13;
1997.&#13;
5.5        Given its importance, MVM's fixed asset holdings can be broken down as follows:&#13;
Table 5.3: MVM Holdings - 12/31/1995&#13;

Effective October 1996, accounts are settled twice per month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
PAKS and OVIT are companies which are slated to remain with MVM in the long term. While the&#13;
outcome of the privatization effort is uncertain, MVM is to dispose of all the shares in conventional&#13;
generators by end-1998, and use the proceeds to finance its investments.1 There is some doubt as to&#13;
whether MWM will be able to sell shares at their book value in some of the generators, particularly&#13;
if they are not at least partially privatized. The other holdings of MVM are relatively small, and&#13;
involve companies related to the energy business (trading, engineering, oil storage etc.).&#13;
B. Financial Prospects&#13;
5.6       The financial prognosis of MVM depends critically on the implementation of the new&#13;
pricing framework. Effective January 1, 1997, the wholesale tariffs of MVM to the distributors will&#13;
cover the recognized costs, the cost of secondary reserves, and a return on proportional equity.&#13;
While it was initially anticipated that MVM would be entitled to earn an 8% return on proportional&#13;
equity effective January 1, 1997 the authorities recently decided that the core utilities, including&#13;
MVM, would be allowed to attain such a return only by the year 2000 (para. 2.12).&#13;
2&#13;
5.7       The financial projections, on the basis of the above assumptions , show that MVM's&#13;
financial performance in the coming years will be satisfactory. Key ratios are expected to be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Table 5.4: Forecast Financial Ratios&#13;
___1997  199   199   2000&#13;
Current Ratio                  1.0   1.6   1.0   1.0&#13;
Debt:Debt and Equity          14%   16%   16%   15%&#13;
Debt Service Coverage Ratio   n.a.   n.a.  119.4  41.5&#13;
Self Financing Ratio         26%   41%   63%   73%/c&#13;
The above ratios are adequate and result inter alia from: (i) the low indebtedness of MVM; and&#13;
(ii) the anticipated proceeds from the sale of shares. In order to ensure that MVM will remain&#13;
financially viable in the future, agreement was reached during negotiations that MVM's margins&#13;
will be such that they will enable the company to earn a selffinancing ratio of not less than 40%&#13;
during 1998, and not less than 55% from 1999 onwards. Given that the Government intends to&#13;
apply, by 2000, the same regime to MVM that presently applies to the other Hungarian utilities&#13;
(para. 2.12), consideration should be given to waiving this covenant once a financial framework&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank has been introduced. With respect to 1997, MVM will not be able to reach&#13;
such financial targets. However, it has considerable liquidity, as a result of the sale of shares during&#13;
Govermment Resolution 1114/1994 provides that MVM will be the beneficiary of stock sales.&#13;
Furthermore, the proceeds will be earmarked for the investment needs of MVM. A copy of the Resolution&#13;
is in the Project file (Annex 7.1).&#13;

1996 (about US$40 million net), which it intends to use to finance its investment program; this is in&#13;
accordance with the present regulations (para. 5.5).&#13;
5.8        The financing plan over 1997-99 can be summarized as follows:&#13;

Long Term Loans                   30             176             37%&#13;
As the above table indicates, MVM should be able to finance about 63% of its investment program&#13;
from internal sources1. This is particularly the result of the anticipated proceeds from privatization.&#13;
In order to ensure that MVM's finances remain sound, agreement was reached during negotiations&#13;
that: (i) MVM will maintain at all times a current ratio of not less than 1. 0; and (ii) MVM will not&#13;
incur new long term debt if as a result, its debt service coverage ratio will be less than j. 52 Based&#13;
on the above, the financial position of MVM should remain satisfactory in the coming years.&#13;
C. Financial Risks&#13;
5.9        MVM  faces different types of risks in its activities: (i) it faces a market risk in that it&#13;
contracts for power purchases on a long term basis; and (ii) it is operating on a thin margin, with a&#13;
relatively small asset base. However, MVM is well aware of these risks and the following remarks&#13;
are in order: (i) with respect to the market risk, MVM long term supply contracts are well below the&#13;
anticipated requirements of the distributors, hence it is unlikely that MVM will be confronted with&#13;
excessive commitments on its hands; and (ii) with respect to the narrow margins, the new&#13;
regulatory regime specifically provides for the recovery of the recognized costs of operating the&#13;
transmission system and allow the transmitter a gradually increasing return on its proportional&#13;
equity (para. 2.12).&#13;
Including proceeds from privatization. Excluding those, the ratio would drop to about 40%, which is still&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
2      For the purposes of calculating the debt service coverage ratio, one shall take into account also the&#13;
anticipated debt service obligations from the affiliates of MVM.&#13;

PART VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Costs and Benefits&#13;
6.1       Least-Cost Analysis. The proposed project is justified on the basis of overall system&#13;
needs; it enters the national least-cost power plant expansion program, prepared by MVM, as&#13;
early as 1998.1&#13;
6.2       Comparison of Alternatives. A separate cost comparison was performed by MVM for&#13;
three possible solutions for assuring 220 MW secondary reserve capacity.2&#13;
(i)    Capacity Import. A market research conducted by MVM  established that about 160&#13;
MW capacity can be purchased only on a short-term basis for the purpose of the&#13;
secondary reserve. An additional 220 MW can be secured in Austria or Slovakia--the&#13;
most suitable candidates--only by building new capacity at a cost similar to that of&#13;
Hungary. However, additional costs would be incurred because of the need: (i) to pay&#13;
transmission fees to the Hungarian border; and (ii) to strengthen the transmission&#13;
network in Hungary.&#13;
(ii)   Construction of Pumped Storage Capacity. A preliminary investigation found the&#13;
installation of a pumped storage plant near Sima (in the North-East region of Hungary)&#13;
a costly option due to unfavorable geographical conditions and difficulties in water&#13;
supply. There is also considerable environmental opposition to the construction of a&#13;
pumped storage plant. Given the lead times required, a pumped storage plant could not&#13;
be commissioned before 2003.&#13;
(iii)   Quick Start Gas Turbines.&#13;
6.3       The comparison shows that the unit capacity cost of the proposed project is less than&#13;
half of either of the other alternatives. The results of the comparison are summarized as follows:&#13;
Table 6.1: Comparison of Alternativesa&#13;

b. Includes the cost of installing additional transmission lines in Hungary plus 30 MW extra power plant&#13;
capacity needed to cover in-kind transit fees to the Hungarian border.&#13;
The least-cost study updated by MVM in April 1996 is in the Project File (Annex 7. 1).&#13;
2      Details of the comparison are in the Project File (Annex 7.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
6.4       Economic Internal Rate of Return. The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)&#13;
was calculated using the estimated economic costs and benefits of the project. As part of the tariff&#13;
adjustment of January 1, 1997, MVM is entitled to receive an incremental revenue of Hft 2,981&#13;
million per year on account of the project. This is equivalent to a capacity fee of HFt 13,550 per&#13;
kW/year, or US$85 per kW/year, which is to be maintained in real value over time. To proxy the&#13;
economic benefits, the latter figure was taken as a minimum value of the user willingness to pay for&#13;
the secondary reserve capacity. The social discount rate assumed for the economic analysis is 12%.&#13;
The evaluation period is 1996-2020. Further details of the underlying economic assumptions are in&#13;
Annex 6.1. The EIRR was calculated to be 15.6%, which is satisfactory.&#13;
6.5       The calculated EIRR is an underestimate of the true economic benefits conferred by the&#13;
project because it does not include the consumer surplus and some economy-wide benefits&#13;
associated with the UCPTE interconnection, such as economic energy interchange, greater&#13;
opportunity for cross-country power transit, and the stimulus that higher quality electricity service&#13;
provides for foreign direct investment in high technology industries.&#13;
B. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
6.6       Calculations were carried out to test the robustness of the economic viability (proxied&#13;
by the EIRR) of the project to variations in key parameters. Switching values (at which the Net&#13;
Present Value is zero and the EIRR is 12%) were also calculated (Table 6.2). The results show&#13;
that the project's EIRR is robust under all scenarios, except the low-probability worst-case&#13;
incorporating a concurrent deterioration of all parameters (where the EIRR drops slightly below&#13;
12%):&#13;

QUICK START GAS TURBINE PROJECT&#13;
Power Sector Reform&#13;
Intoduction&#13;
1 .    Of all the countries in Eastern Europe, Hungary has gone furthest in restructuring&#13;
its power sector, and privatizing power utilities. As a matter of fact, as of end- 1996 the&#13;
six distribution utilities (distributors), three generation utilities (generators), had, for all&#13;
practical purposes, been privatized, and negotiations were continuing for a third one.&#13;
This Annex, which relies extensively on the Information Memoranda] prepared in&#13;
connection with the privatization efforts, highlight important features of the restructuring&#13;
of the Hungarian power sector.&#13;
Corporate Restructuring&#13;
2.    Until end-1991, the Hungarian power sector was integrated under the MVM&#13;
Trust. As such the trust owned and operated all the facilities in the country. On&#13;
December 31, 1991, the MVM Trust was incorporated into MVM, the national grid&#13;
company, six regional distribution companies, seven conventional power generation&#13;
companies, and one nuclear power generation company (PAKS). Nearly all the shares of&#13;
MVM were entrusted to what is known today as APV Rt, the Hungarian State&#13;
Privatization and Holding Company Ltd.&#13;
3.    Ownership of the six distributors was initially assigned to MVM (50%), APV Rt&#13;
(47-49%), and municipalities (2-3%). Following the integration of a number of coal&#13;
mines with power plants, the ownership of the generators was assigned to APV Rt (34-&#13;
50%), MVM (35-50%), SZESZEK  (0-21%), municipalities (0-9%) and other entities&#13;
(0-18%). Towards the end of 1995: (i) golden shares were issued by the generators,&#13;
MVM, distributors, PAKS, and OVIT (the operator of the transmission system) to APV&#13;
Rt; and (ii) MVM exchanged its shares in the distributors, against APV Rt's shares in&#13;
PAKS and OVIT (MVM incurred a significant extraordinary loss on account of this&#13;
transaction).&#13;
4.    The golden shares grant the Government special rights aimed essentially at&#13;
preventing major changes in the institutional framework. Thus the approval of the holder&#13;
of the golden share is required to decrease the registered capital of a company, modify its&#13;
main purpose, merge or transfer to another company significant activities and issue stock.&#13;

Operational and Commercial Aspects&#13;
5.    The eight generators typically own each one power plant (based on coal, fuel oil,&#13;
natural gas or nuclear power) and in the case of coal-fired power plants, often the&#13;
associated mines. The generators also produce heat for domestic and industrial purposes.&#13;
6.    MVM: (i) owns and operates the transmission grid; (ii) purchases electricity from&#13;
the generators, and sells such to the distributors; (iii) is the holding company for PAKS&#13;
and OVIT; and (iv) owns a number of subsidiaries affiliated with the power business. In&#13;
particular, MVM is responsible for dispatching most of the power produced by the&#13;
generators, for initiating the development of new capacity, and for the overall safety and&#13;
security of supply.&#13;
7.    The six distributors have the exclusive right to supply electricity within their&#13;
regions, and are effectively obliged to purchase the bulk of their requirements from&#13;
MVM.&#13;
8.    Over 1992-95, the relationship between MVM and the other utilities was&#13;
regulated by a Master Framework Agreement which, for all practical purposes, served as&#13;
a basis for the operation of the power sector in Hungary. In addition, MVM concluded&#13;
operational contracts, commercial contracts and development agreements with the&#13;
utilities. Under that framework, MVM inter alia played a key role in the financing of the&#13;
sector by: (i) providing short term and revolving credit to the utilities; and (ii) arranging&#13;
long term financing for development projects. At the end of 1995, MVM entered into&#13;
bilateral contracts with the unprivatized generators (to be terminated upon privatization)&#13;
providing these financial backing, similarly to the prior framework.&#13;
9.    The present commercial relationships between the different operators are largely&#13;
influenced by the Electricity Act 1994 (as amended). I MVM, in cooperation with the&#13;
utilities, has prepared an Operational Code which was conditionally approved by the&#13;
authorities. The Code assures a minimum level of cooperation between the different&#13;
parties operating in the sector. MVM has entered into long term contracts with the&#13;
generators (these contracts are currently being revised). Similarly, MVM has entered into&#13;
long term energy supply agreements with the distributors.&#13;
Planning of New Capacity&#13;
10.   The Act and the Operational Code provide that MVM is entrusted with the&#13;
planning of new generating capacity. In this respect, MVM is updating every two years&#13;
a load forecast, and the resulting system development plan, based on least cost principles.&#13;
This plan defines inter alia the strategy for increasing system capacity. Such plan is&#13;
subsequently submitted to the Government and to Parliament for approval.2 Once&#13;
A copy of the Electricity Act is in the Project File.&#13;

power stations of 200-600 MW are subject to Government approval. Parties may offer to MVM to&#13;

ANNEX 2.1&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
approved, new generation projects are subject to a tendering process called by MVM in&#13;
conjunction with HEO. In the first round, MVM invites tenders from existing holders of&#13;
a generation license. If less than three offers are received, such project will be subject to&#13;
an open tender.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
11.   Act XLVIII of 1994 sets the regime governing the power sector in Hungary.&#13;
Under the Act, the Government sets energy policy, and retains certain rights such as the&#13;
approval (through Parliament) of new power plants in excess of 600 MW; approves fuels&#13;
selection in plants in excess of 200 MW; and fixes the tariffs. The sector is regulated by&#13;
the Hungarian Energy Office (HEO), which inter alia is in charge of enforcing the&#13;
Electricity Act, approving the contractual framework, protecting consumers, issuing&#13;
licenses and administering those. The Act sets the principles under which electricity&#13;
tariffs will be established effective January 1, 1997 (recovery of reasonable investment&#13;
and operating costs including standby capacity, environment protection, insurance,&#13;
decommissioning, safety etc.). While tariffs are promulgated by the Governnent, their&#13;
elaboration and application are under the responsibility of HEO.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
12.    Although retail tariffs were increased significantly in the past (most recently, by&#13;
8% on September 1, 1995 and 18% on March 1, 1996), the industry as a whole was not&#13;
earning a return commensurate with the investments made in the sector, and some&#13;
utilities were operating at a loss. Under the electricity Act, and related legislation, the&#13;
tariffs introduced on January 1, 1997 were expected to cover costs, and enable the utilities&#13;
to earn an 8% return on proportional equity (that is the portion of equity corresponding to&#13;
assets used for the electricity business). HEO conducted its review of the tariffs during&#13;
the summer of 1996, and concluded that retail tariffs ought to be increased by&#13;
approximately 35%. Such an increase was considered excessive by the Government,' and&#13;
in December 1996, it decided to increase retail tariffs, on average by 24.9% on January 1,&#13;
1997.&#13;
13.   In order to still comply with its own laws, and undertakings to the privatized&#13;
utilities in particular, the Government maintained the target of an 8% return on&#13;
proportional equity, but: (i) deferred the time at which certain provisions should be&#13;
created (for security stocks, nuclear fuels disposal, nuclear power plant decommissioning,&#13;
coal mines closure etc.); (ii) reduced the return to which certain entities (MVM, PAKS,&#13;
OVIT) would be entitled to, at least initially; (iii) deferred the recognition of certain&#13;
build generation capacity not included in the official plan; the appraisal process for such projects is&#13;
similar to the tender process applied to projects included in the plan.&#13;
The cost of energy (heating fuels, district heating, electricity, natural gas, etc.) in 1995 already&#13;
accounted for 9-14% of per capita income, which is very high by international standards. Source:&#13;

expenses (insurance) until adequate policies are formulated; and (iv) required certain&#13;
efficiency improvements. By so doing, the Government expects to still enable the&#13;
utilities to earn the stipulated return on equity. The Government also decided to: (i)&#13;
adjust tariffs on a quarterly basis; (ii) phase in gradually the cost items whose recognition&#13;
was deferred; and (iii) address distortions in the tariff structure through the revision of&#13;
July 1997. Obviously, the adjustment of electricity tariffs to economic levels has proved&#13;
painful politically, and will deserve close monitoring in the future.&#13;
14.   Regarding the generators, distinct bulk tariffs apply to the 13 power plants owned&#13;
by the 8 generators. The bulk tariffs of the generators are characterized by a capacity fee;&#13;
where applicable, a mine capacity charge; and an energy fee. The mid- 1996 tariffs of the&#13;
generators can be summarized as follows:&#13;
Capacity charge       Mine Charge (where applicable)     Energy Fee&#13;

Separate tariffs are applicable for cogeneration, and plants based on renewable energy&#13;

15.   The tariffs of MVM, the grid company, are uniform. The mid-1996 structure was&#13;
as follows:&#13;

The first scale applies to such consumers who do not use electricity for water heating and&#13;
heat.&#13;
17.   Distinct tariffs apply to high voltage, medium and low voltage non-household&#13;
consumers, temporary supplies, public transport, public lighting, during peak and off-&#13;
peak hours. Capacity charges are typically in the range of HFt 2,460-7,140/kW/yr&#13;
(US$16-48/kW/yr), and energy charges in the range of HFt 3.6-7.2/kWh (US¢2.4-&#13;
4.8¢/kWh).&#13;
The First Privatization Round&#13;
18.   The Government decided to privatize the sector gradually with the following&#13;
objectives: (i) improve the quality of supply; (ii) supply electricity at a reasonable price&#13;
(through merit-order dispatch and quasi competition at the distribution level); (iii)&#13;
develop the power system in accordance with international standards; (iv) provide&#13;
financing for new investments; and (v) maximize Government proceeds from the sale of&#13;
assets. Consistently with the above, in October 1995, the Government offered shares in&#13;
seven generators (all, but PAKS which will remain an MVM subsidiary), the six&#13;
distributors, and MVM.&#13;
19.   With respect to the generators, the initial offering provided for about 34-49.7%&#13;
of the shares (with an option to increase their share to 50% plus one vote by December&#13;
1997); with respect to the distributors, on average 47.8% (with an option to increase their&#13;
share to 50% plus one vote by December 1997); and with respect to MVM. 24% (with an&#13;
option to increase its share to 25% plus one vote within a year). The declared intentions&#13;
of the Government in subsequent stages can be broadly described as follows: (i) offer to&#13;
sell up to 15% of the shares of the generators (except PAKS) and distributors to the&#13;
employees; (ii) offer to sell up to 9.8% of the shares of MVM to its employees, as well as&#13;
I  Since the distributors are subject to the same bulk tariffs, and retail tariffs, the effective margins of the&#13;
different distributors vary, depending, inter alia on their market mix.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

those of PAKS and OVIT; (iii) offer to sell up to 25% of the shares with APV Rt of the&#13;
distributors to those municipalities in which they operate (on a pro-rata basis) and about&#13;
8% to restitution coupon holders; (iv) transfer by end-1996 to the Social Security Funds&#13;
about 8% of the shares of the distributors, and a certain number of shares in generators&#13;
and MVM; (v) offer to sell by December 1997, up to 15% of MVM's share to strategic&#13;
investors (including the successful tenderer for the initial offering); (vi) offer to sell after&#13;
December 1997, through a public offering, the balance of its shares in the distributors;&#13;
and (vii) by December 1998, have MVM sell the balance of its shares in the generators&#13;
(other than PAKS). Thus, ultimately, the generators and the distributors will be&#13;
controlled by strategic investors, with the balance of shares owned by employees,&#13;
municipalities, the Social Security Funds, and the public. Given its strategic role, the&#13;
Government would retain majority control in MVM.&#13;
20.   Consistently with the above, four strategic investors I accuired in 1995 about 47-&#13;
49% of the shares in six distributors, and two strategic investors , shares in two&#13;
generators. Total proceeds to APV Rt were about US$1.3 billion. A new offering was&#13;
initiated in 1996 for the generators for which no offer was accepted in 1995. Under this&#13;
new round, up to 80% of the were offered to strategic investors in the first round with an&#13;
obligation to purchase the balance of shares not earmarked for designated recipients. By&#13;
end-1996, an additional generator had been partially privatized, and negotiations were&#13;
continuing over the privatization of a fourth one. The privatization of the remaining three&#13;
conventional power plants integrated with coal mines appeared more difficult (high cost,&#13;
environmental liability, limited remaining life etc.).&#13;
These are Bayenwerk, EdF international, Isar-Amperwerke and RWE/EVS.&#13;

QUICK START GAS TURBINE PROJECT&#13;
Proposed Supervision Plan&#13;
A. Reporting Requirements&#13;
1.    Project execution will be monitored to record progress against the implementation&#13;
schedule, identifying and agreeing with the borrower on any corrective actions that may be&#13;
required in respect of individual components. Reporting will be prepared quarterly, and&#13;
will comprise a financial section recapitulating project expenditures, a section assessing the&#13;
progress of each of the programmed activities by reference to the implementation&#13;
schedule, and an evaluation of the pi gress made.&#13;
B. Supervision Plan&#13;
2.    Given the performance of MVM on past projects, and the procurement&#13;
arrangements for this project, only three supervision missions are proposed, in April and&#13;
October 1997, and in April 1998 (start up of commercial operations). The implementation&#13;
completion report will be prepared during 1998.&#13;
3.    The calendar of missions is proposed to be as follows:&#13;
June 1997                 Supervision Mission       Power Engineer, Financial&#13;
Analyst&#13;
December 1997             Supervision Mission       Power Engineer&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
A.    GAS TURBINE PLANT AT LITER&#13;
Site Description&#13;
I .    The 2.4 hectares project site is located in the outskirts of Liter village&#13;
approximately 1 km North-North-East from the settlement (1850 inhabitants) in the&#13;
Transdanubian (Dunantul) region, about 95 km South-West from Budapest. To N.W.&#13;
from Liter the region is bordered by the Veszprem highland, to S.E. by the Balaton&#13;
highland and the Vilonya hills. Lake Balaton, one of the most important recreation areas,&#13;
is about 5-6 km from the site. Within the geographical environment of the project site&#13;
there are four more settlements (S61y, Vilonya, Balatonfuzfo, Kiralyszentisva 300, 600,&#13;
5300, 300 inhabitants, respectively).&#13;
2.    The deterrnining morphological element of the natural landscape is a dolomite&#13;
range in NE-SW direction. Treeless parts of the rocky surface are covered with thin soil.&#13;
The Northem part is a highland of an average altitude of 200 m (BSL). The surface is&#13;
interrupted by small cone-shaped formations and ridges. The dolomite range is almost cut&#13;
into two parts by the so-called "great structural line of Liter" followed by the Bendola&#13;
creek. Along the line there have been seismic activities that can be characterized by a&#13;
maximum activity of 6-7 and 0.15 acceleration of 100 year frequency. In the geological&#13;
construction of the area the base rock can be found directly under the thin topsoil;&#13;
limestone, dolomite, and, at some places, lime marl with clay marl inclusions. The most&#13;
important water resources in the area are the karstic waters in the carbonate deposit that&#13;
forms the base rock of the Bakony mountains. The springs come to the surface at an&#13;
altitude of 200 m (BSL) or over. The springwaters flow in E, SE direction corresponding&#13;
to the slope. The Bendola-creek having its source in the great structural zone runs in the&#13;
wide erosion bed.&#13;
Environment status&#13;
aimatic Conditions&#13;
3.    The yearly average temperature in the region is about 10 C (2.3 to 26.6).&#13;
Relative humidity varies between 62 to 83%. Rainy days of the year amounts to 120. The&#13;
most likely wind directions are N-NW (14.4%) and NW (13.7%); the average wind&#13;
velocity is about 3 m/s.&#13;

Water Quality&#13;
4.    Subsurface water (karstic water wells) have high hardness values and total salt&#13;
content (350-600 mg/L). Nitrate concentrations can achieve 30 mg/L (potable water&#13;
standard: 20 mg/L).&#13;
5.    Bendola-creek running in the vicinity of the area is in the Sed-Nador system is&#13;
contaminated by numerous mine water and wastewater inflows from industrial plants.&#13;
Air Quality&#13;
6.    Annual ambient air concentrations were estimated as follows: 15-30 ,ug/m3 for&#13;
SO2, 24-45 for ,ug/m3 for NO2, 33-48 ,tg/m3 for dust. Yearly limit values are 70, 70, 50&#13;
,Ig/m3, respectively.&#13;
Noise&#13;
7.    There are several traffic roads in the vicinity making the environment considerably&#13;
noisy. Noise load measurements have shown that loads in the daytime period were close&#13;
to the guideline values or higher by some dBs. In the night no excess values were&#13;
measured at the border lines of the site, and nearby houses.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts&#13;
Construction&#13;
8.    Approximately 3000 m3 of soil layer is to be excavated and shall be stockpiled&#13;
safely in order to be backfilled after construction.&#13;
9.    Building materials and construction equipment shall be transported to the site by&#13;
road. This may cause higher noise and dust levels than usual in the daytime. Measures&#13;
(e.g. wet the roads) shall be used to prevent unnecessary noise and dust. Wastes shall be&#13;
collected and disposed (by the contractor). Any hazardous wastes collected shall be&#13;
treated according to regulations. Air pollution by engine exhausts shall not be significant.&#13;
Construction shall not disturb natural habitats.&#13;
Air Pollution and Air Quality&#13;
10.   Emission levels of dust, NOx, and S02 shall be below the permissible values. All&#13;
pollutants are within Hungarian air quality standards.&#13;
Soil Quality&#13;
11.   Soil may potentially be affected by oil manipulation (transport, racking, storage,&#13;
feeding). Monitoring system shall immediately detect leakage and corrective measures&#13;
will be carried out immediately. Soot deposit in surface waters and on soil is negligible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4.8'&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
Surface and Subsurface Water Quality&#13;
12.   Communal wastewaters shall be collected and transported for disposal, accordingly&#13;
no negative impacts are anticipated. A drain system will collect rainwater. Rainwater&#13;
flows shall be led to an oil separator as they can be contaminated.&#13;
13.   Balaton can only be affected by the airborne emissions. Due to short operational&#13;
periods and reduced emission levels no significant impacts are forecast. The same is valid&#13;
for Bendola-creek. According to geological conditions of the area, subsurface water&#13;
contamination can be neglected.&#13;
Impacts Originating from Handling and Storage of Raw Materials and Wastes&#13;
14.   Fuel oil and demineralized water are the only raw materials. Appropriate measures&#13;
will ensure hydrocarbon emissions and spills from tanks will be insignificant.&#13;
15.   Hazardous wastes (oil, oily rag, oil absorbing material, oily sludge, used batteries&#13;
and air filters of the gas turbine) shall temporarily be stored at a hazardous waste storage&#13;
place until transported away for disposal or to be destroyed. Asbestos-containing&#13;
insulation or sealing materials, halon gases for fire extinguishing and halogenated&#13;
transformer oils are not permitted to use at the plant.&#13;
Noise Emissions&#13;
16.   According to the Hungarian regulations the soundpressure level 1 m distance&#13;
from the gas turbine building (container) may not exceed 85 dB(A) and at 10 m from the&#13;
border line is 70 dB(A). Those values will be specified in the bidding document. The&#13;
noise load caused by the new facility may not exceed the current noise load limits which&#13;
are 40 dB(A) at the dwelling houses during night time and 50 dB(A) during daytime.&#13;
Measurements indicate that the traffic noise load limit of 60 dB is sometimes exceeded or&#13;
closely approximated. Only negligible additional load can be expected from the project.&#13;
All permits for construction and operation have been obtained. These permits were&#13;
reviewed and accepted by appropriate environmental authorities. Thus environmental&#13;
authorities have provided their approval of this project.&#13;
Other Impacts&#13;
17.   As a result of short operational time and small absolute volume of flue gases, no&#13;
detectable microclimatic changes are expected. Airborne emissions shall not have effect&#13;
on the ecology. On the basis of available data of ecological habitats only small reversible&#13;
changes in the flora and fauna can be expected during construction. Although the plant&#13;
shall be built on an agricultural area the landscape shall not be significantly influenced by&#13;
the sight of the power plant. No negative health impacts are expected.&#13;
Socio-economical Impacts. Results of Public Hearing and other Communications.&#13;
18.   During January and February 1996 MVM. organized a public information&#13;
procedure in harmony with legal rules. The independent committee supervising that&#13;
procedure has made decision including inter alia the following statements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4. 8,&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
*  The project is in accordance with the Hungarian energy policy with&#13;
environmental protection principles.&#13;
*  On the basis of the feasibility study and the environmental impact statement as&#13;
well as by personal and other information given by the MVM. and its&#13;
representative agents the local public and all the public (non governmental)&#13;
organizations had the possibility to make their comments and obtain&#13;
satisfactory response on their questions.&#13;
*  According to the summary report prepared for MVM, the Committee stated&#13;
that the population concerned do not refuse the project, however, made&#13;
certain reservations from environmental point of view. The majority of&#13;
questions referred to the noise level, fuel quality, air pollution, etc. Responses&#13;
given and future actions considered in order to satisfy the public expectations&#13;
and demands were adequate.&#13;
19.   Furthermore the Committee is of the opinion that&#13;
-  the investor should keep on informing the concerned municipalities,&#13;
* the investor should ensure the access of public documents concerning the&#13;
project for the affected municipalities as well as the possibility to make&#13;
comments on them, and&#13;
*  the Hungarian Energy office should prescribe in its license the obligation of&#13;
posterior reporting on each starting of the plant - in order to check the&#13;
operation mode as secondary reserve.&#13;
Monitoring System&#13;
20.   During operation, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, solid particulates, carbon&#13;
monoxide, oxygen or carbon dioxide concentrations of the flue gas as well as temperature&#13;
and volume flow shall be monitored in the stack. Noise measurement will be made in the&#13;
surrounding villages. Operation of the oil trap shall be checked by soil sampling and&#13;
analyzing for oil on a monthly basis. Measured data shall be collected according to the&#13;
relevant regulations.&#13;
Environmental Impacts of Decommissioning&#13;
21.   Project life is 30 years. After shut-down, equipment shall be disassembled and&#13;
transported from the site. The dismounted machine equipment can be recycled, the&#13;
underground concrete structures shall remain in place. No waste shall remain on the site.&#13;
22.   Expected impacts of decommissioning are similar to those of the construction&#13;
period. Only air pollution and noise caused by dismounting activities and transportation&#13;
are to be considered. Neither negative impacts to the surface and subsurface waters nor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4.8,&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
soil contamination can be expected if the decommissioning is performed with the utmost&#13;
care. The area shall be remedied and landscaped. However, current land use can not be&#13;
fully restored.&#13;
Environmental Protection Measures&#13;
23.   In the case of oil fired gas turbines NO. emission reduction can be achieve either&#13;
by water injection in the combustion chamber or by appropriate burner construction (dry&#13;
low NO, burner) depending on the combuster/turbine design selected.&#13;
24.   To comply with the environmental rules communal wastes shall be collected in a&#13;
closed reservoir and transported for disposal. Oil resistant tray at the oil racking station&#13;
and under the pipelines shall prevent oil spills on the soil. Oily waters and oil spills from&#13;
the turbine shall be collected in an oil trap and cleaned in an oil separator. The separated&#13;
oil shall be collected and transporteL "'or burning or disposal.&#13;
25.   Noise protection shall be ensured by silencers, special sound insulation, and casing.&#13;
26.   To prevent impacts of accidents which might occur during transportation and on&#13;
material movement routes traffic roads shall have a hard cover and pavements shall slope&#13;
towards the catch basin. Liquid material runoffs shall be collected in the above-mentioned&#13;
oil separator. Leakage of fuel shall immediately be explored by the monitoring system&#13;
making possible taking the necessary measures without delay.&#13;
27.   For the case of earthquakes designing prescriptions of national standards shall be&#13;
taken into account and be supervised by licensing authorities.&#13;
28.   Fire protection regulations are also prescribed in detail in relevant official orders&#13;
and standards. In the case of fire extinguishing spread materials can contaminate the soil.&#13;
However, extension of that contamination can easily be delineated and the&#13;
decontamination be performed.&#13;
B.  GAS TURBINE PLANT AT SAJOSZOGED&#13;
Site Description&#13;
29.   The 2.4 hectares project site is located in the outskirts of Saj6szoged in SW&#13;
direction from the settlement, about 155 km East-North-East from Budapest, and about&#13;
22 km SE from Miskolc, the largest town nearby.&#13;
30.   Average altitude of the region is about 100 m BSL. The original surface has been&#13;
transformed by erosion into hillfoot ridges of 5 m/sq.km average relief. Variations in&#13;
topography are the abandoned river bed indicating the former flow direction to Tisza,&#13;
Saj6-Hernad and Hej6 rivers. Settlements in the area are mostly agricultural, but here are&#13;
also industrial plants in the region (Tiszaujvaros: power plant, chemical works TVK).&#13;
Near the site there are some protected areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4.8&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
31.   General geological structure shows successive layers of gravel, sand, silt and clay.&#13;
Materials are sedimentary rocks and metamorphological slates. The most important water&#13;
resource in the area is the Saj6 river. Water volume contained in the gravel bench is about&#13;
5-6 km3. Maximum water flow that can be extracted is 500,000 m3/d. The most&#13;
important supply source is precipitation.&#13;
Environment Status&#13;
Climatic Conditions&#13;
32.   The yearly average temperature in the region is about 9.6 C (-5.3 to 26.5 C).&#13;
Relative humidity varies between 51 to 95%. Monthly average precipitation in the region&#13;
is between 30 mm and 78 mm. Most frequent wind directions is North (15.1%) and NE&#13;
(10.7%); average wind velocity is about 2.5 m/s. The highest number of foggy days are in&#13;
December (9).&#13;
Water and Soil&#13;
33.   Subsurface water level fluctuation is 1.5 m in average. Quality of subsurface&#13;
waters can be characterized by relatively low pH value and high carbon dioxide content&#13;
(lime aggressivity). Chemical parameters of the groundwater are satisfactory except for&#13;
manganese content exceeding the Hungarian Standard on Drinking Water Quality by 10-&#13;
80%. Heavy and toxic metals were not found. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)&#13;
analysis performed on groundwater to check oil leakage and contamination indicated&#13;
exceedances of drinking water limits (100 ptg/L). Soil samples show small oil&#13;
contamination.&#13;
Air Quality&#13;
34.   Four monitoring stations are located in the vicinity. Additionally at the Primary&#13;
School of Saj6szoged a dust sampling device was established. Daily average&#13;
concentrations show values between 5-60 pg/m3 for NO2 (limit 85 ig/m3), 6-113 ug/m3&#13;
for SO2 (limit 150 1ig/m3), and dust concentrations between 21-62 pg/m3 without excess&#13;
of the limit values.&#13;
Noise&#13;
35.   Heavy traffic in the area makes the environment noisy in daytime. In the night&#13;
period the noise load at the dwelling houses was max. 35 dB(A), less than the limit value.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts&#13;
Construction&#13;
36.   Approximately 3000 m3 of soil layer is to be excavated and shall be stockpiled&#13;
safely in order to be backfilled after construction.&#13;
37.   Building materials and construction equipment shall be transported to the site by&#13;
road during the construction. This may cause higher noise and dust levels than usual in&#13;
the daytime. Measures (e.g. wet the roads) shall be used to prevent unnecessary noise&#13;
and dust. Wastes shall be collected and disposed (by the contractor). Any hazardous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4.8&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
wastes (oil, etc.) collected shall be treated according to regulations. Air pollution by&#13;
engine exhausts shall not be significant. Construction will not impact flora and fauna.&#13;
Air Pollution and Air Quality&#13;
38.   Emission levels of dust, NOx, and S02 shall be within permissible values.&#13;
Ambient air concentrations for all pollutants are within Hungarian standards.&#13;
Soil Quality&#13;
39.   Soil may potentially be affected by oil manipulation (transport, racking, storage,&#13;
feeding). Monitoring shall detect leaks. Corrective measures will be carried out&#13;
immediately. Soot deposit in surface waters and on soil is negligible.&#13;
Surface and Subsurface Water Quality&#13;
40.   Communal wastewaters (max 1m3/month) shall be collected and transported for&#13;
disposal. No negative impacts are anticipated. A drain system shall collect rainwater.&#13;
Rainwater flows shall be led to an oil separator as they can be contaminated. No effects&#13;
on groundwater quality by the power plant can be expected.&#13;
41.   Fuel oil and demineralized water are the only raw materials. Appropriate measures&#13;
will be taken to ensure hydrocarbon emissions and spills from tanks will be insignificant.&#13;
42.   Hazardous wastes (oil, oily rag, oil absorbing material, oily sludge, used batteries&#13;
and air filters of the gas turbine) shall temporarily be stored at a hazardous waste storage&#13;
place until transported away for disposal or to be destroyed. Asbestos-containing&#13;
insulation or sealing materials, halon gases for fire extinguishing and halogenated&#13;
transformer oils are not permitted to use at the plant.&#13;
Noise Emissions&#13;
43.   According to the Hungarian regulations the sound pressure level 1 m distance&#13;
from the gas turbine building (container) may not exceed 85 dB(A). and at 10 m from the&#13;
border line is 70 dB(A). Those values will be specified in the bidding document. The&#13;
noise load caused by the new facility may not exceed the current noise load limits which&#13;
are 40 dB(A) at the dwelling houses during night time and 50 dB(A) during daytime.&#13;
Currently the sound pressure level on the fuel transportation road is 49 dB(A). Increases&#13;
caused by fuel transportation activity would only be max. 1 dB(A). Noise levels with the&#13;
project shall increase slightly over current values. However, all standards will be met.&#13;
Other Impacts&#13;
44.   As a result of short operational time and the small absolute volume of flue gases,&#13;
no detectable microclimatic changes are expected. Airborne emissions shall not have&#13;
effect on the ecology. On the basis of available data of ecological habitats only small&#13;
reversible changes in the flora and fauna can be expected during construction. Although&#13;
the plant shall be built on an agricultural area the landscape shall not be significantly&#13;
influenced by the sight of the power plant. No negative health impacts are expected.&#13;

QUICK START GAS TURBINE PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis: Key Assumptions and Results&#13;
I .    The incremental revenue of HFt 2,981 million that MVM is entitled to receive on account&#13;
of the project was used as a proxy for the economic benefits conferred by the project. This is&#13;
equivalent to a capacity charge of HFt 13,550 per kW/year, or US$85 per kW/year, which is to be&#13;
maintained in real value over time. Under the ruling of the Hungarian Energy Office, the capacity&#13;
charge is to be incorporated into the wholesale margin of MVM. HFt 13,550 per kW is a&#13;
conservative benefit proxy; considerably higher capacity charges--ranging from HFt 24,000 to&#13;
HFt 30,000 per kW/year--are being asked by foreign investors for new IPP projects that are under&#13;
consideration. Also, the full recovery of environmental and decommissioning costs would justify&#13;
higher economic capacity fees than assumed. The annual operating cost was estimated at Eit 355&#13;
million, or US$2.2 million.&#13;
2.     All costs are expressed in January 1997 constant economic prices, net of taxes and&#13;
subsidies. The physical contingency is 10%. The assumed social discount rate is 12%. The&#13;
calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return and Economic Net Present Value is based on&#13;
the aggregate 220 MW secondary reserve capacity to be established under the project. The&#13;
parameters and results of the economic analysis are shown in the table below:&#13;

            Hungary - Quick Start Gas Turbine Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Quick Start Gas
            Turbine Project is to provide about 200 Megawatt (MW) of
            generation reserve capacity to enable Hungary to maintain a
            level of reliability and security of supply in line with
            international standards.  The project consists of two
            complete single cycle gas turbine power plants rated at
            about 110 MW each, burning light distillate fuel oil.  The
            plants will consist of the following fully integrated
            components: 1) main equipment (gas turbine and generator
            sets and auxiliaries, air inlet, exhaust gas systems,
            including stacks, electrical equipment, power plant control
            system, high voltage switch gear and unit transformers,
            enclosures and light structure buildings); 2) auxiliary
            systems (fuel supply system, demineralized water supply,
            water supply for extinguishing system, fire detection and
            protection system, telecommunications and remote and
            indication systems); 3) civil works (site preparation,
            leveling, earthwork, foundations, roads and fences, site
            improvements, cable and piping channels and trenches); and
            4) network and infrastructure (telecommunications link).
