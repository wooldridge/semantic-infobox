&#13;
BECKER: Good afternoon. Today is Monday, February 27, 2006, and I'm William&#13;
Becker, at the World Bank Group Archives. And I'm here today to interview Jean-&#13;
Francois Rischard.&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Rischard?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I am indeed Jean-Francois Rischard. I used to be vice president for&#13;
some 12 years in the Bank. I retired a few months ago, and that's why I'm being&#13;
interviewed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very good, very good. I would like to begin by asking a few obvious&#13;
questions, if I may, about your background. When and where you born?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was born October 2, 1948, in Luxembourg, in the city of Luxembourg,&#13;
where I grew up. I'm still today a national of Luxembourg.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Luxembourg.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I was for a long time the only Luxembourg staff member in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: From Luxembourg?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I've been to Luxembourg, soâ&#128;&#148;who were your parents? Were they&#13;
academics or lawyers or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: My father was a physician. My mother was also trained to be a medical&#13;
doctor, but stopped before final graduation because she met my father. So it was more&#13;
of a medical family, but both my parents were very cultivated, intellectually curious&#13;
types.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Uh-huh. Were they from Luxembourg?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: My father was from Luxembourg and my mother is French.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: French.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                  February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: She's still alive.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Do you have siblings?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I have two brothers and one sister, all younger than me. I was the oldest&#13;
of four children.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Uh-huh, okay. Where were you educated?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I started to read and write in German, in the primary school system of&#13;
Luxembourg, which functions with both German and French.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And over the schooling years, then you gradually move to a regime&#13;
where it's eventually 50-50, French and German. So you will have one year&#13;
mathematics in French, the next year in German. History keeps going from one&#13;
language to another. .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . I even learned Latin, in French, then in German, then in French again,&#13;
and so forth. So I grew up in the public primary school system there, then went to public&#13;
secondary school at an institution called AthÃ©nÃ©e Grand-Ducal in Luxembourg until age&#13;
18, and then I went to France to study at the university. Luxembourg does not have a&#13;
university, so you have to go abroad.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did you decide to take advance degrees in economics and then the&#13;
law?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: From the age of 17 on, I was very taken by economics. I would read the&#13;
articles on economics in the newspapers, and my mother bought me an economics&#13;
manual written by a Belgian professor, and I became interested in this field.&#13;
&#13;
But then since I wasn't sure what I was going to do, whether I really wanted to do&#13;
economics, I also studied, simultaneously, law. So I did the two degrees at once, which&#13;
was a lot of work, but wasâ&#128;&#148;if you stretched the envelope feasible. But it meant passing&#13;
the economics exams in June and then studying very hardâ&#128;&#148;catching up the law during&#13;
the summer and then passing the exams in September in law. The two degrees were like&#13;
two different worlds. Throughout my career, I have loved doubling up like that, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll&#13;
give you an example later on.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And you said you went to France. Where in France?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I went to Aix-en-Provence. As I said, Luxembourg does not possess a&#13;
university, so you have to go somewhere, and I picked a place which was furthest away&#13;
from my family and where the girls looked the prettiest, to boot ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. Well, very good.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . and where, by the way, the law studies and economics studies were&#13;
actually very high-quality by French standards.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was a powerful set of reasons!&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I've been to France a number of times, but not Aix-en-Provence.&#13;
&#13;
Now, you practicedâ&#128;&#148;you went back to Luxembourg, then, to practice law. What kind&#13;
of law did you practice?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Actually, the economics degree I did in the French system. The law&#13;
degree I did in the Luxembourg system. They had a system where you could pass&#13;
national exams, but you took the law courses anywhere you wanted so long as it was the&#13;
Napoleonic law system that was taught. Having passed the two systems, I stayed in Aix-&#13;
en-Provence and started teaching economics to the first-year students at university. I&#13;
must have been 23 years old when I was lecturing on macroeconomics.&#13;
&#13;
And at the same time, I started doing a few law cases in Luxembourg. But since I was&#13;
physically not there a lot, it was occasional. So I pursued my first lawyerâ&#128;&#153;s activities off&#13;
and on, but never really became an established lawyer in Luxembourg.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, I see, okay. Now, then you decided to take an MBA degree from&#13;
Harvard Business School. What prompted that decision, and when was that?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was after I had my two post-graduate degrees in law and economics&#13;
in 1973. So I was 24 or 25 years old. Essentially, by then I wanted a much more&#13;
practical form of training, with the view of going to the Bank. Actually, I already knew&#13;
that I wanted to go to the World Bank, and in those days doing a Harvard MBA was the&#13;
way to go.&#13;
&#13;
And so I applied to several MBA programs in the U.S. and Europe, not knowing much&#13;
about them. I passed the sort of standardized test to go into U.S. MBA programs, did&#13;
pretty well, and could have gone to INSEAD or Wharton or [inaudible], and so forth.&#13;
But the Harvard Business School was the one I knew the best, and Harvard was the one&#13;
that made it easiest to go into the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So I went to the Harvard Business School with a clear idea in mind,&#13;
which was to go to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: When did you learn English along the way?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Along the way. Starting at age 13 or so in Luxembourg high schools,&#13;
you would start English.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But since you had a base of German and French, it would be . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, and Latin.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . and Latin, it was pretty easy to get into English. Yet when I arrived at&#13;
the Harvard Business School, I found it at first hard to speak and read at the speed of my&#13;
American friends, and so I had to learn very quickly how to express myself clearly, how&#13;
to read through enormous case studies at night fast, and so forth. So I had to learn&#13;
quickly, and the hard way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. Did you take theâ&#128;&#148;I guess it was called the BIGE course at Harvard?&#13;
That's the business, government and international economics course.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, you had to take that during the first year. It had another name then.&#13;
It's now called the BIGE, but it was called IEM, or something like that. And I took it,&#13;
but I found it light-weight because I already had doctoral degrees in economics and law.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Often I had a feeling that I knew a lot of that stuff much better than the&#13;
professors.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I was going to sayâ&#128;&#148;yes, I was going to say I knew some of the&#13;
people who taught in that program.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Bruce Scott was already there. Do you know him?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: No. I knew Tom [Thomas K.] McCraw and a fellow named Vietor andâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Richard Vietor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. Actually, I'll tell you a story later, but when I recently got in contact&#13;
with them, they offered me to teach the course. This was a few months ago.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, really, really?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And Alfred Chandler, too, who I don't think taught . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, Chandler was the great man at HBS in those days.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: [Henry] Cabot Lodge was there, too.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes. I had studied with Chandler, so that's how I got to know all the&#13;
people there.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. Actually, I've seen the current curriculum of the BIGE course&#13;
because they offered me the job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I was taken aback that it hadn't changed much compared with the&#13;
early â&#128;&#152;70s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It hadn't evolved really, and I was disappointed at that. The New Deal.&#13;
The 1967 sterling devaluation . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Anyhow, that's a little besides the point of our talk.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. We could, yes [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
Now, you said that you had become interested in the World Bank. How was that interest&#13;
prompted? Did you study international economics in university or . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, I was drawn toward international economics, and I'm from a very&#13;
small country which considers the world to be its oyster. It's so small, Luxembourg, that&#13;
you have to be international.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Moreover, Luxembourg hosted the European Union institutions existing&#13;
at the time, so I was swimming in an international environment. And the World Bank&#13;
had a tremendous reputation in those days, largely because of [Robert S.] McNamara,&#13;
the Green Revolution, et cetera. And my parents were idealistic types, particularly my&#13;
father, so it was natural for me to be interested in something like the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And then I met a banker in Luxembourg, a Belgian, called [Philippe] Duvieusart, who&#13;
had been two or three years at the Bank. And he said he had had wonderful years&#13;
working in the staff of the World Bank. And in French, "staff" means the high-level&#13;
staff of an army, so I wrongly understood him to have immediately operated at the top of&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The top, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And since I was an ambitious type, I thought it would be very easy to get&#13;
to the top of the Bank just like him. And so this mistaken reasoning also made it&#13;
enticing to go to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see. So you came to Harvard, then, with this idea of the Bank in mind. At&#13;
the time you got the MBA, did you have to specialize in a particular area or was it . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. You could take electives in the second year, and I took a lot of&#13;
international economy, international finance courses, and so forth. But I also took&#13;
(which was unusual for MBA students) some development courses â&#128;&#156;across the riverâ&#128;? at&#13;
the faculty of arts and sciences, in the economics department. One of my professors was&#13;
someone who ended up working in my first vice-presidency many years later, who's&#13;
called Millard [F.] Long, and who was a great specialist of financial systems.&#13;
&#13;
Another professor in development economics I had across the river at Harvard was Ernie&#13;
[Ernest] Stern's brother, Joel, who was working for HIID [Harvard Institute of&#13;
International Development]. And so I was taking courses preparing myself for&#13;
something like the Bank; but I nevertheless kept an open mind. And, actually, in the&#13;
second year I had several job offers other than the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But I'll have to tell you how I missed the Bank interviews, and so forth. I&#13;
got into the Bank in a surprising way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did that happen?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, as I said, I missed the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s campus interviews, and I didn't even&#13;
know the interviewers of the YP [Young Professionals] Program had been there. So I&#13;
wrote a hasty letter to the Bank saying I missed the interviews several months or weeks&#13;
back, but could I still apply for the YP program? And to my surprise, they invited me to&#13;
the final round of the interviewing, probably on account of my very exotic nationality.&#13;
&#13;
And so I went straight into these final interviews. In terms of physical appearances, I&#13;
was a sort of hippie type. I had very long hair and I had nine silver chains around my&#13;
neck, no necktie. I didn't look the part at all. Yet I had a wonderful interview with&#13;
Ralph Hanan, who was running the YP program. He asked me one main question--&#13;
which was about shadow prices. And that I had studied exhaustively across the river&#13;
with Millard Long, so I was good at giving a technically perfect answer.&#13;
&#13;
My luck continued, and I was then interviewed by a Haitian staff member called Marc&#13;
[L.] Bazin, who merely asked me about the May '68 riots in Paris and other places in&#13;
Europe. Of course, which Iâ&#128;¦ [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You had been there?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I had been there and was one of the student leaders in my country at that&#13;
time. So I knew all about May â&#128;&#153;68. . . . Another perfect answer!&#13;
&#13;
And then the third interviewer was the chief economist for the East Africa Region. He&#13;
was called Rudolph Hablutzel, and was a cigar smoker. When he asked me off the bat&#13;
what development depended on, I responded that it depended mostly on cultural and&#13;
religious factors--which was something you werenâ&#128;&#153;t supposed to say in those days. And&#13;
that led to a very spirited conversation with him on [Max] Weber and other theories.&#13;
&#13;
And those were my three one-question interviews and I made it into the Bank. That&#13;
year, there were 25 YPs coming in the September cohort.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This is 1975.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: September 1975. Amazingly, half of these 25 YPs were from my class of&#13;
the Harvard Business School.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: This is because, in those years where, as I said, the Harvard Business&#13;
School was sort of the main entry channel for YPs.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what was the YP program like in 1975?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was wonderful. It was small. It was, like today, well-managed. They&#13;
were looking after you. I had downplayed the fact that I spoke French because I wanted&#13;
to escape being assigned to Africa right away, but I nevertheless ended up on my first&#13;
job on Madagascar, a wonderfully interesting assignment.&#13;
&#13;
And then, having participated in the economic mission in Madagascar, where with my&#13;
long hippie hair I was handling employment issues and population control issues, I did&#13;
what I could to enter into the Industrial Projects Department.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why had you selected that?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Because it was one of a few worldwide departments. And it was very&#13;
finance-intensive. Its projects involved very big, complex industrial ventures under state&#13;
control, but complicated projects. And I was really attracted to that department,&#13;
famously known as the most demanding department in terms of quality and technical&#13;
knowledge requirements. And it had the beauty of being a worldwide shop. In short, it&#13;
was the place to go in those days.&#13;
&#13;
So I did my best to get there, and I got there. I was interviewed by the division chief of&#13;
the Chemical Division, who was called Chauncey [F.] Dewey, who was a wonderful&#13;
man . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . who looked at me and said that he would may perhaps recruit me, but&#13;
that I had to swear that I would stay at least two years. He didn't quite trust that I would&#13;
be stable enough to stay with the Bank. And yet I stayed 30 years!&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: The Bank has a reputation for being a very buttoned-down, white-shirt kind&#13;
of operation. Were you put under any pressure to change your appearance?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, not at all. The Industrial Projects Department had a very interesting&#13;
group of eccentrics, and you could do certain things that you couldn't do elsewhere. By&#13;
the way, the director of the department was called Hans Fuchs. He was a very precise,&#13;
meticulous, brilliant German. So the professionalism was very, very high. It was one of&#13;
the most demanding departments, and the way he ran it made even more demanding.&#13;
&#13;
But despite this professional rigor, you could do certain things. I remember an engineer&#13;
called Don [Donald E.] Brown, who was often working in blue jean suits. And I myself&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
would go to the office in jeans from time to time. Also, I had the habit of showing up&#13;
only at eleven o'clock a.m. and then working very late into the night. So I would arrive&#13;
late in the morning because I would sleep in the morning! We had a very good-natured&#13;
and interesting culture in the Industrial Projects Department. At the same time, we were&#13;
real pros.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, over the yearsâ&#128;&#148;first off, allâ&#128;&#148; you say that half your program intake,&#13;
the YP Program, were people from Harvard. Did you know many of them, or all of&#13;
them?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, I knew many of them, and some of them are still here today, and&#13;
I've tracked most of them in their professional lives after they left, and they all did very&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And did you sayâ&#128;&#148;then there were maybe 12 or 13 others who you met for&#13;
the first time. Have you stayed in touch with any of these people? I mean . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, to this day for most of them. Deedee [DeAnne S.] Julius, for&#13;
instance, was one of the women who joined that particular batch of the YP Program, and&#13;
she was until recently on the Council of Monetary Affairs of the Bank of England, a real&#13;
feat for an American. She's now running Chatham House in London, and I saw her a&#13;
few weeks ago, and we exchanged war stories. We've been in touch ever since we left&#13;
the Bank and graduated together.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, what were some of the first projects that you worked on in&#13;
theâ&#128;&#148;you know, in the industrial sector?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was in the Chemical Division, Industrial Projects Department Division&#13;
III [Projects, Chemical, and Fertilizer Industries], which was one of three divisions.&#13;
There was one division that was doing steel and mining which was run by a gentleman&#13;
with the unbelievable name of [Leon] Hartsell Cash. And Chauncey Dewey was&#13;
running the second division, the Chemical Division in which I was. The third division&#13;
was doing miscellaneous industriesâ&#128;&#148;textiles, pulp and paper, shoe factories, and so&#13;
forth.&#13;
&#13;
And in the Chemical Division, chances were you would end up working mostly on&#13;
fertilizer projects. So I ended up at first in the fertilizer business, and my first projects&#13;
were to supervise fertilizer projects in India, for instance, in Gorakhpur. Then I worked&#13;
on a very problematic fertilizer project in Bangladesh, in Ashuganj. And I did a lot of&#13;
work in Romania, which was a very big industrial borrower in those days, and did a few&#13;
projects in Romania as well, some fertilizer, some not, and did a lot of work in that&#13;
country. Therefore, India, Bangladesh and Romania were my main travel destinations in&#13;
the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what responsibilities did you have? I mean, what, in fact, were you&#13;
doing?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was always the so-called financial analyst. The typical team would&#13;
include a senior engineer, who was often the project leader. And then you had a second&#13;
person for the financial analysis, which was often me, and sometimes a third or a fourth&#13;
who was often a specialized consultant.&#13;
&#13;
In those days, you had to wait several years before you could lead a mission. So the&#13;
people that would run the missions were like coaches and mentors at the same time, for&#13;
youngsters like me. (This useful practice has unfortunately disappeared from todayâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Bank.) But even in that subordinate role, I would still have full responsibility for the&#13;
financial and economic analyses and the market analysis.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, eventually you became an expert on petrochemicals or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I started on fertilizers, and over the years became good at chemicals&#13;
and chemical industry. I could recognize all the equipment pieces, and so forth. I was&#13;
always running around with engineers and loved it and learned a lot from themâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
engineers like Antonio [S.] Tarnaviesky, who was wonderful; the eccentric Don Brown;&#13;
and many others. They were often colorful characters, and they had tremendous&#13;
experience and knew a lot of things. And so I became good at this, and even developed&#13;
a basic sense for chemical engineering issues . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you if along the way, you know, had you studied&#13;
chemistry.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, but I started knowing the basic formulas by heart and, as I said, the&#13;
equipment pieces, the flow in the factories, the markets of petrochemical products--to&#13;
such an extent that at some point I took a few months off, which you could do in this&#13;
department, from doing project work, and I wrote a book that was published by the&#13;
World Bank on the chemical and fuel uses of methanol. This book, which was&#13;
technically very detailed and complete, had a lot of impact in the industry.&#13;
&#13;
It was, for example, forecasting large markets for methanol as a raw material for a&#13;
product called MTBE, which was an octane booster, and a lot of MTBE factories were&#13;
built as a result of the book signaling the merit of that product in terms of natural gas and&#13;
methanol uses. When I see that book today, it's written by someone who really knows&#13;
this stuff. So I picked up a lot of industry knowledge at the time.&#13;
&#13;
And I was among the most qualified financial analysts in that team, and so I was also&#13;
helping others. I also introduced several methodological improvements in the financial&#13;
analysis of the projects, particularly in the selection of mutually exclusive projects, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
calculation of adjusted rates of return, and the valuation of natural gas. I became a sort&#13;
of expert in natural gas applications.&#13;
&#13;
And then over time we started doing petrochemical projects in Brazil and in India, and&#13;
those were new for the Bank. They were very complicated because the Bank would&#13;
finance the so-called ethylene cracker, and then you had six, seven downstream units for&#13;
polyethylene, polypropolene, MPVC, and so forth. Those would often be financed by&#13;
IFC [International Finance Corporation], and the two houses would collaborate closely.&#13;
&#13;
And to analyze a complex like this, and to do the economic return, you had to include&#13;
the seven downstream units, plus the cracker. It was a very complicated piece of&#13;
financial analysis, and so I became specialized in these.&#13;
&#13;
And at the time, not only were we doing qualitatively challenging work, but we also&#13;
managed huge volumes of Bank projects in chemicals. One year, I remember our&#13;
Chemical Division committing $2 billion worth of loans by itselfâ&#128;&#148;something like 15%&#13;
of total Bank lending that year.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: This was in the '70s?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: This was in the second part of the '70s and the early â&#128;&#152;80s.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Big industrial projects operations in those days.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And our division had less than 20 technical staff. Actually, we became&#13;
so good at all this that we started also doing advisory work for Saudi Arabia.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In those days, the Saudi Arabian government would hire the Bank to help&#13;
them analyze joint venture propositions from the oil companies and the chemical&#13;
companies. And we would sit with the Saudis, with an outfit called SABIC [Saudi&#13;
Arabia Basic Industries Corporation], now a giant multinational, and something called&#13;
the PIF, Public Investment Fund, to help the Saudis analyze the proposals and negotiate&#13;
the deals they were concluding with foreign oil companies and chemical companies like&#13;
Dow Chemical and others. And that was fascinating work because it was project work&#13;
of the highest order, but for very demanding clients.&#13;
&#13;
So all in all, I learned a lot in that Industrial Projects Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                      February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. What did the industry think about the World Bank providing this&#13;
kind of financial expertise, you know, to the other side?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: To the Saudis?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, they were grateful because this would give more professionalism to&#13;
the Saudi side of the negotiations. And the Bank was able to provide the sort of project&#13;
appraisal which the Saudis themselves could not have produced with their scarce and&#13;
novice staff.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Essentially, we were providing a much stronger grounding to the&#13;
projects. And we did some very important things. For example, I was one of the people&#13;
that recommended the pricing formula for natural gas pricing and profit sharing in Saudi&#13;
Arabia based on a country-wide cash-flow sharing analysis, which is still more or less a&#13;
model today.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you stayed at the Industrial Projects through the beginning of '82?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: '82, and then I made a strange move. What had happened is that being a&#13;
sort ofâ&#128;&#148;how shall I say without being boastfulâ&#128;&#148;a star financial analyst, I was sort of&#13;
the top of the line when it came to very fancy financial analysis.&#13;
&#13;
And in that capacity, I was doing quite a bit of thinking. One day, I realized that the way&#13;
the World Bank was disbursing loans was very strange. The Bank would borrow&#13;
currencies all over the worldâ&#128;&#148;Swiss francs, French francs, pound sterling, dollars,&#13;
whatever. And a dollar loan would be made, expressed in dollars to, say, Romania for&#13;
instance, and the Bank would put an interest rate on that loan; let's say 5 percent or&#13;
whatever it was. But the currencies that the Romanians would get debited were the ones&#13;
that happened to be disbursedâ&#128;&#148;these currencies would be whatever the Bank was&#13;
disbursing the day the Romanian disbursement request would come in and be processed.&#13;
&#13;
So you could have three weeks in a row where contracts were coming in from one&#13;
borrower for financing, and we would disburse Swiss francs against them. Then we&#13;
were out of Swiss francs and it was time for French francs or Italian lira, and then the&#13;
next borrower would see these currencies debited against his loan. So it was sort of the&#13;
luck of the draw, and two identical borrowers for $100 million each could have&#13;
completely different compositions of these loans at the end of the disbursement. Some&#13;
would have a lot of Swiss francs to repay, some would have little Swiss francs but had a&#13;
lot of softer currencies to repay. And so the effective cost of each loan was different,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
once you took the evolving exchange rates into account. No borrower had any ex ante&#13;
idea of what his loan was going to really cost.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, and some risk involved with that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, Romania actually ended up with a lot of Swiss francs and had to&#13;
payâ&#128;&#148;in effect, because the Swiss franc went upâ&#128;&#148;huge interest rates on its loan and on&#13;
an all-in effective basis. Other borrowers were luckier. There may even have been some&#13;
â&#128;&#156;insider tradingâ&#128;? going on.&#13;
&#13;
So I was struck by this haphazard handling of the disbursement pattern, and the resulting&#13;
pricing aberrations. I constructed a model. These were the days where we were using&#13;
the first computers to do simulations, and I was IT-versed enough to be able to create my&#13;
own models in FORTRAN. I built a sort of model that showed how effective interest&#13;
rates on loans could be completely different, based on what would happen to the&#13;
disbursements and the exchange rate scenarios thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
And I packed this into a two- or three-page note, which made its way to the finance&#13;
complex, to the Treasury people, to Moeen [A.] Qureshi, who was the senior vice&#13;
president of finance, on the other side of the house. And they were so impressed by that&#13;
note, which was actually revealing a very grave weakness of the Bank's pricing system&#13;
for loans and its disbursement systems, that they offered me right away a job in the&#13;
financial think tank of the Bank--which was called Financial Policy and Analysis, FPA.&#13;
&#13;
So that's how I moved over from industrial project to the so-called Finance Complexâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
which was very rare to move, from operations to finance.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. I was going to ask how that happened because that is unusual.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and I did a lot of moves like this . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . over time, triggering my own moves, but making very unusual moves.&#13;
This was just the first one of them.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, but I mean you didn't see this as a way of making this move. I mean,&#13;
you wrote the memo and . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, but the fact is that this was a policy memo . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . it was a honest-to-God financial policy memoâ&#128;&#148;was my way of saying,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;I'm interested in this stuff, and here is a big issue that everyone needs to look at.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So when you went over to FPA, what responsibilitiesâ&#128;&#148;what did they put&#13;
you to work on?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, there were three divisions in FPA. It was run by Joe [D. Joseph]&#13;
Wood, who later became a vice president and who was one of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s most brilliant&#13;
and charismatic men. FPA was sort of the think tank that McNamara had set up for all&#13;
the policy issues. I wish we had a think tank like this today! It had three divisions.&#13;
&#13;
One division was handling IDA [International Development Association] negotiations. I&#13;
first ended up in that one, but I hated it. I couldn't stand this fundraising work. It was&#13;
not technically demandingâ&#128;&#148;it was all political. There was no financial analysis&#13;
requirement, which was what I was good at. So I immediately shifted from that division&#13;
to another division, which had to do with the formulation and review of financial&#13;
policies of the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. It was&#13;
run by Paul [V.] Applegarth, who actually recently started as the first boss of the U.S.&#13;
Millennium Challenge Corporation. He was then a young division chief in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And I loved that division. It was the place where we would re-think the liquidity policy&#13;
of the Bank. We would formulate the borrowing policy of the Bank. We would review&#13;
the policy for loan pricing, for loan disbursements. It was in a way the asset liability&#13;
management hub of the World Bank, of the IBRD. It was very high-level work, and one&#13;
dealt with wonderfully smart colleagues. Some of the most remarkable people I've seen&#13;
in my Bank career were there.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In that division, and did you deal with people out . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In FPA, in general.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: FPA had some of the best and the brightest in the Bank, and the work&#13;
was fascinating. So you would work on financial policies, which meant as many Board&#13;
papers, and so you had a lot of dealings with the Board. And sometimes you had&#13;
fascinating assignments, involving outside financial industry people.&#13;
&#13;
For example, for a while, we were preparing a blueprint for a Bank affiliate in London&#13;
that would have borrowed on the LIBOR [London Inter Bank Offer Rate] markets. It&#13;
was code-named the World Bank's Bank, and we had feet and feet of documents on how&#13;
much it would cost to get space in London, how we would staff it, what the legal regime&#13;
would be, what sort of a Bank affiliate it would be, and so forth. So anything that was&#13;
an interesting, challenging issue would go to FPA, and I loved that whole area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Did you ever have any interaction withâ&#128;&#148;well, McNamara, I guess, had&#13;
gone by the time you went toâ&#128;&#148;you went over there. I guess he left in . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: McNamara left in '81.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: '81, yes, and you went into this in '82, so . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, so it was during [Alden W. â&#128;&#156;Tomâ&#128;?] Clausen's time, who was a&#13;
fierce banker from Bank of America . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . but who actually was often completely overwhelmed by these financial&#13;
policy issues. . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, Bank of America was into home mortgages mainly, I think, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and Clausen actually got them into trouble. He had to go back later,&#13;
after his Bank tenure, to fix it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And, anyhow you had to deal with Clausen, who was generally interested&#13;
in these issues. We had a lot to do with Moeen Qureshi, who was a very remarkable&#13;
senior vice president. And so I thrived on that job, and as I said, this was the brainiest&#13;
part of the Bank and had remarkable people there to work with the likes of David [P.]&#13;
Bock, Joe Wood. Danny [M.] Leipziger, who is today a vice president of the Bank, was&#13;
there, too.&#13;
&#13;
And after two years of that, Joe Wood offered me a choice between leading two&#13;
divisions, either the Strategic Planning Division.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Within this larger . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I can't remember whether it was in FPA or connected to FPA.&#13;
&#13;
. . or the Financial Management Division, that would focus exclusively on IBRD&#13;
policies and asset liability management. So I took that latter one and became a young&#13;
division chief. I was 35 or 36 at the time, and I ran that division for two years, working&#13;
on the whole array of the financial policies of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
But then something else happened around the time I had become a division chief. We&#13;
had an anxious development: the bankâ&#128;&#148;debt crisis in Latin America . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . '84-'86; Chile first, then Mexico. And, literally, we had to invent on&#13;
the spot the techniques of debt rescheduling and debt restructuring, which had never&#13;
been done in this way before: negotiate with the banks because the commercial banks&#13;
were holding a lot of this debt; and actually use Bank instruments and IMF [International&#13;
Monetary Fund] instruments to help the Bank put in new money and reschedule existing&#13;
debt.&#13;
&#13;
So we literally started in my division a sort of weekend operation, where during the&#13;
week we would work for Moeen Qureshi, who was the senior vice president-finance,&#13;
doing the regular financial policy work, and on weekends we would work for the senior&#13;
vice president-operations, Ernie Stern, and essentially calculate the debt re-schedulings&#13;
for Ivory Coast, for Chile, for Mexico, and actually negotiate these deals with the banks&#13;
in New York. And I loved that. I've always loved having two jobs at once just as I liked&#13;
to double up and complete 2 degrees at once, as I described above. And it was like a&#13;
bootlegger's operation, almost a skunkworks operation. But we became very good at it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, were you involved with the Baker and . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was the [James A. III] â&#128;&#156;Baker Initiative.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It was the Baker Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, we worked at the heart of this Initiative. But one day, I remember, I&#13;
took one of my colleagues, used Mexico as the theoretical case, and described nine&#13;
different ways in which one could handle the Mexican debt overhang. It was an&#13;
unsolicited memo, but very detailed and stuffed with different innovative techniquesâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
e.g., oil-indexed bonds.&#13;
&#13;
But one of them was the technique of â&#128;&#156;defeasance,â&#128;? where you collateralize bonds with a&#13;
zero coupon bond, which I had dug up at Chase Manhattan. And that was one of the&#13;
nine techniques, and that inspired JP Morgan. My paper was given to JP Morgan by&#13;
Ernie Stern and its defeasance ideas inspired JP Morgan and led directly to the&#13;
development of the [Nicholas] Brady Bonds that came in many years later as part of the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Brady Initiative.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: These Brady bonds were based on this defeasance technique idea of ours.&#13;
It's one of the things I'm most proud of having been part of. In fact, I was part of a small&#13;
team with [Jacques] de Larosiere at the Fund, Paul [A.] Volcker, Ernie Stern, Bill&#13;
[William R.] Rhodes in Citibank, Susan Segal at Manufacturers Hanover. There were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
essentially a handful of us handling that debt issue with the banks, with the IMF, with&#13;
the U.S. government, with . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who was the U.S. Treasury representative in this? Do you recall?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was Baker.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, Baker.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and David Mulford.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Baker was actually there?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, mostly Mulford.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It went to Bakerâ&#128;&#153;s level? I thought he . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, on key points, and actually, when the crisis started, he launched the&#13;
Baker Initiative. On the Bank side, I had to flesh it out within 24 hours. There was a&#13;
meeting at the International Institute of Finance, and I wrote literally a piece for the&#13;
Bank, a think piece, five, six pages, on what the Baker Initiative should look like.&#13;
&#13;
It was fascinating stuff, and we did a lot of important work in that mode. And looking&#13;
back, these were some of the most interesting moments in my career, being in the&#13;
cockpit on these things, while still doing the day job, which was to run all the asset&#13;
liability management of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, you had a staff of, what, about 100 people or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. It was a very small division.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, it was small, oh, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Maybe 15 of us.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, I see, okay, because I was going to ask how does one deal with these&#13;
think pieces and the managerial issues and your weekend job, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was quick on my feet and I had good people around me. We did not&#13;
respect the normal hierarchical lines, and would decide and act on the spot.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, that helps in management. That's for sure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Now, this experience must have changed your view of the Bank. I mean, what you knew&#13;
of the Bank was from the industrial side and the project side, and obviously . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and there I really grew in the job. I became the thinker behind loan&#13;
loss provisions, reserve policies, liquidity policy, borrowing policies, re-schedulings.&#13;
All these things I was part of, and I became even more oriented towards finance than I&#13;
was before, and that's what got me to Wall Street.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's my next question. How does all this lead to Wall Street?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The Treasury people in the Investment Department and the Borrowing&#13;
Department started to look up to me as someone who was part of that family, and at&#13;
some point three of us bolted and left for Wall Street to join the firm of Drexel Burnham&#13;
Lambert.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And that opened a new world for me. I left, actually, in October '86, and&#13;
the last job I did for Ernie Stern before leaving was to negotiate the Mexican debt re-&#13;
scheduling in New York, with Ernie on the phone and Volcker and others involved and&#13;
with the Mexican team and the banks in the room. And the Mexican debt negotiator was&#13;
Angel Gurria, who became finance and then foreign affairs minister later in Mexico, and&#13;
who was just named to be the head of the OECD [Organization for Economic&#13;
Cooperation and Development]. I am still in touch with him.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, were eyebrows raised in the Bank when you left for Wall Street?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, because the finance complex of the Bank was not very well known.&#13;
It was a sort of secluded operation. Most people in the Bank didn't know what we were&#13;
up to, except on debt rescheduling issues where they saw our face. But financial policies&#13;
of the IBRD was a thing a small group of people would know about. So we left, and I&#13;
don't know whether it created a stir, but what may have created a stir was that the three&#13;
of us left, en bloc.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who were the other two?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: One was Hani [Khalil] Findakly, who was the head of the Investment&#13;
Department. One was Arturo [Eduardo] Brillembourg, who was a trader. And I was not&#13;
from the trading team at all. I was from the financial policy and asset liability&#13;
management team of the Bank. While there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a stir, there were some jealous&#13;
people. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Why did youâ&#128;&#148;how did it come about that it was Drexel Burnham that . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Because Drexel was the up-and-coming investment bank. It was a very&#13;
aggressive investment bank . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . which was formidably strong in virtually any financial business.&#13;
Actually, when I arrived there, an audit requested by management revealed, to&#13;
everyoneâ&#128;&#153;s surprise, that there were 550 profit centers in Drexel, and that it was always&#13;
number one or number two in each of the businesses: in bond trading, in gold trading, in&#13;
international equity, etc., that is, it was good in everythingâ&#128;&#148;not just junk bonds.&#13;
&#13;
And Drexel was the place to go to if you wanted to get a real whiff of Wall Street at its&#13;
best. And, clearly, my other two colleagues were the ones that had the original contacts.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: They were the ones to get the deals done.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, I see. So you went as the senior vice president for international&#13;
capital markets.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In the beginning, I was just a vice president, and I was sort of the more&#13;
junior one of the three. And I ended up in essentially developing Drexelâ&#128;&#153;s international&#13;
bond business in the world. That was our mandate. And in typical World Bank fashion,&#13;
when I arrived, I spent two months writing up a strategy on what we were going to do in&#13;
Switzerland, in Spain, in Italy, in Japan, in UK. It was an immaculate, sort of World&#13;
Bank-type presentation.&#13;
&#13;
And then we went to see the vice chairman of Drexel with the strategy document in hand&#13;
and said we wanted to have a board meeting because we needed a capital allocation for&#13;
this strategy, about $100 million. And the vice chairman said, â&#128;&#156;What do you mean you&#13;
want us to look at this in a board meeting? We hired you people because we thought&#13;
you knew what to do. Why do you ask us as a board? We have no clue about these&#13;
things! How much money do you need?â&#128;? [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;A hundred million.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Here they are, go for it.â&#128;? So it was another world all right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes. I was going to ask how did, you know, the hot-shot firm on Wall&#13;
Streetâ&#128;&#148;how did the atmosphere compare to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was night and day. There was as much stress as in the Bank, but in the&#13;
Bank it was negative stress. People would always try to raise issues when you had a&#13;
new idea, tried to slow you down, raised concerns about what you were doing.&#13;
&#13;
In Wall Street, it was the opposite. You had a new idea; everyone would band together&#13;
and help you get it done. So you had stress, as well, but it was positive stress.&#13;
&#13;
And what I remember from my three years in Drexel is: a lot of laughter, good humor,&#13;
mutual help, doing deals together; almost nothing in writing, as was shown by my&#13;
incident with the strategy; very quick decision-making and a bottom line that you had to&#13;
honor directly. So for me, these were very happy years. I loved the firm.&#13;
Unfortunately, it hit into insider trading problems, with respect to its dominance of the&#13;
junk bond markets, just a week after we arrived, for no reason of our doing.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And so I saw the firm slide down over the next three years, but it was a&#13;
tremendous firm and I learned a lot. And what I did later in the Bank was because I had&#13;
this . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . catalytic passage through Wall Street.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, why did you decide to leave? I mean, is it that the Bank [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, first, my two colleagues only lasted a year and disappeared, so I&#13;
remained alone.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You had moved to New York, I guess, to . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. I actuallyâ&#128;&#148;I was still living in Washington. I had an office in&#13;
Broad Street, in downtown New York, and I was flying every Monday to somewhere in&#13;
Europe. I had a venture in Spain, in Italy, in Switzerland, in France. We also had a UK&#13;
office, and every Monday morning I'd fly to Europe. Every Friday, I'd be back in&#13;
Washington for the weekend. So I did this for three or four years.&#13;
&#13;
I became senior vice president. We were doing quite well, particularly on swaps, and&#13;
everything was well. And Drexel was going through hellâ&#128;&#148;it eventually had to pay a&#13;
huge fine.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But I still assumed it would go from 11,000 staff down to 3,000 and&#13;
become a Lazard-like outfit, but much more aggressive, and I wanted to stay with them&#13;
in that Lazard mode.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Lazard being more traditional and smaller.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, Lazard is a smaller, more advisory-oriented investment bank; it's&#13;
very famous. So I thought Drexel would become a sort of a more aggressive version of&#13;
Lazard.&#13;
&#13;
And then one day Ernie Stern unexpectedly called from the Bank and said that the head&#13;
of the Investment Department had left, or had been asked to leave. (I've never known&#13;
what it was.) Was I interested in coming back to the Bank and running that Investment&#13;
Department? (I had left the Bank completely; I was not on leave of absence.)&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And this came up out of the blue at a time where I was getting tired of&#13;
flying up and down to Europe every week. I had a little boy who was three years old&#13;
and kept looking at me as if I was a stranger. And when Ernieâ&#128;&#153;s call came, it went to&#13;
someone who had always had a great admiration for the trading department, the&#13;
Investment Department of the Bankâ&#128;&#148;have you ever seen the trading room?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I've seen pictures, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's a fantastic operation, and so that's why I came back. I would not have&#13;
come back to the Bank for anything else . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But for that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . but for the trading room.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Was Gene [Eugene H.] Rotbergâ&#128;&#148;what was his role at that point?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. Gene I had known before.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: He had been the treasurer.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: When I returned, the treasurer was no longer Gene. It was someone&#13;
called Don [Donald] Roth, from Merrill Lynch.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Jessica [P.] Einhorn was running the Borrowing Department [Financial&#13;
Operations Department] and I was running the Investment Department, and fell in love&#13;
with the Investment Department. For three years, I ran this wonderful team in this very&#13;
secluded part of the Bank. It was a trading room where you do the opposite of what the&#13;
other guys do in the Bank. They all do long-term, high-risk placements in developing&#13;
countries, and here you do the opposite. You do very short-term-oriented, very high-&#13;
quality paper placements in the big markets, the so-called high-grade fixed income&#13;
markets.&#13;
&#13;
I loved the fast-paced nature of this department. It was an intellectually challenging&#13;
place: I did a lot of changes to improve the measurement of performance, the risk&#13;
management, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, this is a department that had, what, about 100 people?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It had about 100 people, both traders and so-called back office people.&#13;
We were trading a portfolio of $30 billion ofâ&#128;&#148;these were the assets we had to manage--&#13;
the liquid assets not just of the Bank, but also of IDA and IFC. And we were running a&#13;
turn-over, meaning buying and selling bonds and notes and Treasury bills all over the&#13;
world, at the rate of some $3,000 billion a year, some years $5,000 billion. So it was a&#13;
very actively traded portfolio--very safely traded, but very actively traded. As a matter&#13;
of fact, many of the big traders in Wall Street came from that trading room.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I was going to ask you, where did you get the talent, the trading talent, to&#13;
staff this department?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: There was a very interesting system. We would take World Bank&#13;
economists from Operations and bring them in through a system that was called&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Treasury Fellowships.â&#128;? We would bring them in for six months or a year, take them&#13;
out of their World Bank projects, and put them trading the Fed funds market or the&#13;
Japanese yen bond market or the French OAT [Obligations Assimilables du TrÃ©sor]&#13;
market.&#13;
&#13;
And so the crew was actually made up of World Bank economists who had an interest in&#13;
finance. Many of them would come to the trading department [Investment Department],&#13;
become very good traders, and then leave for Wall Street. So it was a very peculiar way&#13;
of staffing. We would only rarely hire people fromâ&#128;&#148;traders from the street. We were&#13;
growing them . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Inside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . inside.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. I've written a book on the Export-Import Bank, the U.S. Export-&#13;
Import Bank [The Market, the State, and the Export-Import Bank of the United States,&#13;
1934-2000], and getting talent in that bank was an enormous problem because people&#13;
were lured away all the time and it was just very difficult to . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. In our case, we grew them in house.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Here, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And if they left, it was a sign of success.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And so there was a constant flow of young traders. There were also&#13;
some tremendous division chiefs that were looking after this, and we had a special&#13;
system, separate researchâ&#128;&#148;we would formulate our own benchmarks. There was a&#13;
division that did nothing else but formulate benchmarks that were harder and harder to&#13;
beat for the trading divisions.&#13;
&#13;
So if the U.S. benchmark was easily beaten by using CMOs [collateralized mortgage&#13;
obligations], which are mortgage obligations, the next year we would put the mortgage&#13;
obligation into the benchmark and the traders had to find some other thing to beat the&#13;
benchmark.&#13;
&#13;
We also had measurement systems where we could measure the performance of every&#13;
trader, every team, every day, down to the basis points, immediately. And we wrote&#13;
even some of the software of Bloomberg for portfolio management. So it was a very&#13;
interesting, brainy operation. I loved that department. It was great, great atmosphere.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, with bringing in a lot of inexperienced people, were there ever, well,&#13;
disasters or serious problems?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. We had a very clean record. The only near-disaster I remember was&#13;
that we had every day to place some $10 billion or so in the Fed funds market, and that&#13;
was done at great, great speed. You had to do it very, very quickly, bank by bank, and&#13;
you had to check that each bank was creditworthy and then put the money in, but you&#13;
had very little time to do it.&#13;
&#13;
And the woman who was running the Fed funds market, two days or a day before the&#13;
attack of the U.S. and the other allies on Iraq because of its invasion of Kuwait . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . had placed some short-term funds in a Kuwaiti bank. And then&#13;
Saddam Hussein goes into Kuwait . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . and our money was stuck in this Kuwaiti bank, and we had to get it&#13;
out, even though everything was frozen. So we were in a little bit of a sweat, as a few&#13;
hundred million dollars could easily have been lost.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But we got them out.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, okay. Now, do you think that the Bank in this period was responding&#13;
well to the changes in capital markets, I mean, which were changing rapidly in the&#13;
1980s?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, I think we kept ourselves ahead of the changes--first of all, on the&#13;
trading side we were very sophisticated, and I once calculated, when I was running the&#13;
shop, that we could have sold ourselves for $250 million as an operation. That's what&#13;
we were worth as a trading entity. And as I said, many of the star traders in Wall Street&#13;
came from that department over time. There were about 50 big traders that came from&#13;
there, including the number two of Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns.&#13;
&#13;
The Borrowing Department was also very good, and it was in those years that Ken&#13;
[Kenneth G.] Lay was working there. He invented the global bonds, where he would&#13;
issue $1 billion in four markets at the same time. The Bank also invented other thingsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
for example, it did the worldâ&#128;&#153;s first currency swap ever in those years.&#13;
&#13;
So, no, the Bank was very good at remaining up-to-date. Even though the financial&#13;
management of the Bank as a bank was and still is very conservative, there was always a&#13;
lot of creativity in the Treasury of the Bank. .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . which had another consequenceâ&#128;&#148;actually, back then (and to this day)&#13;
the Treasury atmospherics and culture were very interesting and very positive in the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is there still a fairly high turnover? Are you still losing a lot of people, or&#13;
the Bank losing a lot of people to Wall Street or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I assume that's still the case, for very powerful, logical reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But I've noticed that they nowadays sometimes bring in traders from the&#13;
outside who have made a lot of money and who want to do some public service, and&#13;
come in and are hired into the Bank trading room. So there's been a reverse flow which&#13;
didn't exist in my day.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right. Is this the context in which you got to work with Gary [L.]&#13;
Perlin?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, not yet, no.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That's later.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was indeed the one hiring Gary Perlin.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But that was in the next job.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was in the next job. But in my Investment Department job, I did&#13;
something again very similar to what I did with this 1982 memo on disbursement and&#13;
exchange rates we talked about earlier. I had a lot of time in the Investment Department&#13;
because at four o'clock the markets were closed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And if you ran your show well, you had a lot of time. And I wasn't liking&#13;
what was happening on the other side of the Bank. Coming from outside again, I was&#13;
looking at the institution with a new eye. So I wrote a five-pager, which was a manifesto&#13;
on what had to be done to the Bank on the operations side to reform and improve&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
The first page had a list of critical descriptors of the senior management team in the left-&#13;
hand column, and in the right-hand column a list of descriptors of how the senior&#13;
management team should behave. (There were many tensions between Ernie Stern and&#13;
Qureshi at the time.)&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And there were lots of issues about how the team was running. This was&#13;
under [Barber] Conable. And I essentially was saying that the senior management&#13;
system of this Bank wasn't working and that here is how it should work.&#13;
&#13;
Page two, I said we needed absolutely to create a central vice presidency for private&#13;
sector development, one for the environment, and possibly one for human development.&#13;
Page four-five, I was recommending that the Europe and Middle East and North Africa&#13;
Region be split into Eastern Europe and the Middle East, because Russia and all these&#13;
were coming in. Each page had little organizational charts for the new setups I was&#13;
suggesting.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So I was essentially dictating what the Bank should be looking like, and&#13;
that was a very bold, arrogant thing to do. And I shipped it upâ&#128;&#148;no, first of all, I showed&#13;
it to Ernie Stern, who was the senior vice president of finance in those days. He had&#13;
switched with Qureshi. And Ernie didn't dispute what I was saying. He actually&#13;
sharpened some of the first page wording on the malfunctioning of the senior&#13;
management team, but did not interfere much with anything I was saying.&#13;
&#13;
So essentially it was my paper. It was actually not really a paper. It was like&#13;
organization charts saying, â&#128;&#156;Do this.â&#128;? And I shipped it to the president of the Bank, to&#13;
Conable, through his assistant, Marianne Haug. When he got this thing, he was furious&#13;
and called in Ernie Stern and said, â&#128;&#156;Did you ask this little jerk to send me this thing?â&#128;?&#13;
And Ernie denied that he had anything to do with it, which was the truth. He had been&#13;
passively supporting it. And that was the end of that, but then there is a nice sequel to&#13;
the story because Conable leaves and [Lewis T.] Preston comes in.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And when Preston came in, I was still running the trading department,&#13;
and Preston liked to be kept abreast of markets. So every week, I would go up to his&#13;
office and tell him about what happened in the markets. And I was doing this in a sort of&#13;
way he must have liked, so I got to know him a little bit.&#13;
&#13;
And one day, in my third year of running the trading departmentâ&#128;&#148;I was already&#13;
beginning to think of leaving again, back to Wall Street or something like thatâ&#128;&#148;Preston&#13;
called me in said, â&#128;&#156;I want you to start a central vice presidency for private sector&#13;
development.â&#128;? And then he pulled out the old blueprint that I had done for Conable and&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;I'm essentially executing your plan.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And, indeed, all the things I had put in there were doneâ&#128;&#148;the splitting of the EMENA&#13;
Region into Eastern Europe and the Middle East, setting up the three central vice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
presidencies, and they fixed the senior management team. So that paper had a lot of&#13;
impact, even though it was done out of the blue, out of the trading department.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Again, how did youâ&#128;&#148;it seems to be thatâ&#128;&#148;well, you said you had time on&#13;
yourâ&#128;&#148;well, not on your hands, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I had time, and I would talk to many people.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I had this outside view of someone who had left and come back.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I was always curious about things, and so forth. And if I had one&#13;
knack throughout my Bank career, itâ&#128;&#153;s that I'm quickly able to see the gestalt of what&#13;
needs to be done. I still have this today. I know exactly what I would do with the Bank&#13;
by 2015. I always had a for clear sense for what the strategic moves ought to be.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, you weren't here at the reorganization, which is generally thought of&#13;
as being . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, and I was horrified . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was '87.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was horrified by it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: That was '87, when you were away.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I was horrified by the method that had been used and by the fact that&#13;
it presided over what I thought was a dumbing-down of the Bank to a lower level of&#13;
quality and higher level of abstraction.&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact, not only did I do that paper, but I found for you something neat,&#13;
which is a slide show I was presenting all over in the Bank to many departments during&#13;
my Investment Department days. It covered at one glance all the decades of World&#13;
Bank, the '50s to the '70s, '70s, '80s, the '80s, the '90s. And for each decade I was&#13;
describing the buzz words, the context, the fastest growing business, who was the hero,&#13;
who was the under-dog, the presidential style of each of these periods, the staff morale,&#13;
the reputation for technical excellence. And for that period of the '80s, I was saying that&#13;
the Bank was declining.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. I'd like to have that. That would be very useful. Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, that's interesting stuff because it wasâ&#128;&#148;this was a very controversial&#13;
slide show, andâ&#128;&#148;what was more amazing, it was being presented by the head of the&#13;
trading department. I essentially was saying that the Bank was going into a direction&#13;
where its technical expertise would go down. There had been a sort of takeover by the&#13;
macroeconomists in '87, which I thought was very damageable for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, did you ever find out how Preston got hold of your organizational&#13;
blueprint? Did Conable give it to him on the way out or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I suppose so.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But it's a wonderful story because it showed, first of all, that you could&#13;
do this in the Bank--that you would not be punished for this arrogance.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But, number two, that it has had an impact . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . like my first memo had an impact and sort of caused a reform of the&#13;
loan pricing and disbursement systems. And my own job changes were often triggered&#13;
by these things. . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So could you talk a little bit about Preston? I mean, Preston was here for a&#13;
short time, and in a way even while he was hereâ&#128;&#148;because of his illness and all. But&#13;
could you just describe him? Not many people that we interview worked very, you&#13;
know, closely with him or for any length of time. What was your impression? You&#13;
obviously worked with him fairly closely for a while.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I admired him a lot. He had a very good sense of management,&#13;
much more than his two predecessors and his successor.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: He had a real managerial acumen, and actually the central vice&#13;
presidencies that he set up were superb creatures. That was a wonderful little&#13;
reorganization because the Bank needed to have these central vice presidencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He was a very elegant man in every sense of the word, and at the same time he was a&#13;
very shy man who was quite reserved. He didn't like the limelight. He didn't like to&#13;
speak on TV.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Sort of ill at ease with a lot of the nature of the debates in the Bank, and&#13;
you could see it. But when I would come and do my market sort of update, he was&#13;
perking up.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But I'm sure five minutes later you would talk about some problem in&#13;
Mexico and he would not be really as perked up as he would be.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes. Now, the otherâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s always struck me that people who come&#13;
from, you know, the private sectorâ&#128;&#148;well, Conable came from the Congress, but Clausen&#13;
and McNamara had had a career in the private sector. Dealing with a resident boardâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
wonder, did Preston ever talk to you about that? I mean, that's certainly not the style of&#13;
the Morgan Bank.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, and actually they were all shell-shocked by needing to deal with that&#13;
Board. So was [James D.] Wolfensohn, and I'm sure [Paul D.] Wolfowitz at this point.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But Preston did it. He chaired the Board in this elegant manner he had,&#13;
and I remember a famous scene in the Board where I think it was a Canadian executive&#13;
director who was giving him a lot of grief on something and kept repeating the same&#13;
demand. And Preston just stood up, walked from his chair from where he was chairing&#13;
the Board, walked behind the executive director of Canada, puts his hands on this&#13;
fellowâ&#128;&#153;s shoulders and said, â&#128;&#156;Look, I told you we would discuss this later.â&#128;? [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
But he was a very interesting leadership figureâ&#128;&#148;and someone I really worshipped, even&#13;
without knowing him that well. He was a great man, and when he died I remember&#13;
having tears in my eyes. I was so sad. He had cute expressions. He was very New&#13;
York. He was a patrician from New York, and when he would tell me something, a little&#13;
bit of gossip, he would say "between us girls."&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But he was someone who probably was not very happy in the Bank&#13;
world. But he was very good to the Bank because the few things he did on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
organizational side were superb, whereas Clausen had not been a very high-performing&#13;
president, and Conable, either.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Preston actually set some of the stages for what then was done by Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn later. And he corrected some of the deficiencies brought about by the ill-&#13;
conceived â&#128;&#153;87 reorganization, quietly.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, when you became the vice president for Finance, Private Sector&#13;
Development and Infrastructure, didâ&#128;&#148;well, I didn't know about your memo, so my&#13;
question might be somewhat off the point here. But did Prestonâ&#128;&#148;I mean, obviously you&#13;
knew what you wanted this vice presidency to do. Did Preston give you some sense of&#13;
what he wanted you to do with this vice presidency?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. I was given one paragraph saying we would set upâ&#128;&#148;meaning, I&#13;
should set up a central Vice Presidency for Finance and Private Sector Development.&#13;
And it was amazing, but the three of us ([Armeane M.] Choksi; [Ismail] Serageldin; me)&#13;
who were asked to start the three central Vice-Presidencies were given more or less carte&#13;
blanche. There were people in the respective specialties scattered all over the Bank, and&#13;
we could sort of marshal them into the new vice presidencies. But still, basically, we&#13;
started them from scratch.&#13;
&#13;
So I had to leave my trading room to set up this vice presidency. Of course, I had&#13;
authored the whole thing myself to some extent. At any rate, I had to proceed quickly.&#13;
You had to decide whom you wanted to have, how many shops, what would be their&#13;
titles, who would lead them. I designed the new vice-presidency within one week, with&#13;
the help of a few trusted hands, such as Magdi Iskander.&#13;
&#13;
I decided early on that I wanted my teams to be heavily oriented toward doing things,&#13;
giving cross-support to other parts of the Bank and very little paper-writing and&#13;
academic sort of research. I actually found the 1993 memo through which I was&#13;
welcoming all my new staff. There it is; I had not read this memo since then.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, okay, thank you.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's a note that gave the flavor of the shop, which I meant to be very, very&#13;
much like a very fast response, high-level consulting firm, and actually always had a&#13;
vision of it with senior partners, partners, senior associates, associates. I never got that&#13;
done because it was forbidden in the Bank to use such labels, but that's essentially how&#13;
we ran it.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, I see.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I had, of course, the freedom of taking the best people and I had a&#13;
star team which was Richard [D.] Stern, who became vice president later . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . Magdi Iskander, who was fantastic, and then former V.P. Gary Perlin,&#13;
whom I fished out of retirement from Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage&#13;
Association].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: He was 42 years old and retired.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So I lured him back into the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Now, how did youâ&#128;&#148;I've interviewed Perlin. It's a wonderful&#13;
interview, and he keeps sending me papers and things, speeches of his and all. Did you&#13;
know him? I mean, you must have known him . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I knew of him because in Treasury we had meetings with other treasurers&#13;
sometimes, and he was considered a very good treasurer at Fannie Mae. Moreover, he&#13;
was an ex-World Bank guy.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And Jessica Einhorn liked him. We all liked him, but it was a chance in&#13;
a hundred to get him back into the Bank. But I got him back to run the Financial Sector&#13;
Development Department, which had to do with reforming banking sectors and&#13;
developing capital markets, eventually.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. I guess his first assignment was Argentina, was it, or if I recall . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I had cooked up a complicated backup facility structure which was&#13;
actually my design. It was a structure whereby banks in Argentina would issue medium-&#13;
term bondsâ&#128;&#148;in order to have them make ten-year loans, which they didn't do at the&#13;
time--and if they had a problem refinancing the bonds every three years, the backup&#13;
facility would buy the new bonds.&#13;
&#13;
And I had designed this for [S.] Shahid Husain because even though I was vice&#13;
president, I would still design transactions. And when Gary Perlin came in, I had him&#13;
immediately assigned to making that thing go live. I actually may still have the memo&#13;
where I was laying out this transaction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But this in the early '90s is a . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Here it is, the bond structure.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, great. Iâ&#128;&#153;ll have to read that. I'm sure these are in the Bank records&#13;
someplace.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Unlikely.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: They're not?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, they're probably not. These are from my private hoardâ&#128;&#148;I have a&#13;
whole hoard of things like theseâ&#128;&#148;I was never good at filing things, but some things I&#13;
kept.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay, well, very good. I appreciate it.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Anyway, there were three departments. One was Financial Sector&#13;
Development, Gary Perlin. One was Private Sector Development; that was privatization,&#13;
deregulations of utility sectors, improving the business environment, bankruptcy laws,&#13;
things of that kind.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Who . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was Magdi Iskander from Egypt, who was one of my colleagues in&#13;
the Industrial Projects Department. And Richard Stern was running the third&#13;
department, called Industry and Energy [Department].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the financial sector, the Bank became more interested in this, I&#13;
guess, after the experience of the '80s. Was this a Bank initiative, the whole idea that&#13;
you need toâ&#128;&#148;I don't like to use the term "Washington Consensus," but if you're talking&#13;
about a different approach, a neo-liberal approach to development, whereâ&#128;&#153;s the ideaâ&#128;&#148;is&#13;
it the Bank or is it the Fund? Is it the U.S. Treasury?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. There were just many banking crises in those days. In Spain, in&#13;
Scandinavia. In Latin America. In Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And they were going very deep. They would often cost 5, 6, 10,&#13;
sometimes 30 percent of GDP, and handling them well was a massive job--someone had&#13;
to do it. And so it was typically done by the IMF with Bank help, the Bank doing the&#13;
longer-term things like installing supervisory systems, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Actually, there was a small division working on such things even before I started setting&#13;
up the central Vice Presidency for Finance and Private Sector Development. I took over&#13;
that small team which came from, I think, the Research Department and which had&#13;
people in there that were good at reforming banking sectors and bank supervision&#13;
systems, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
All I did is to blow this up under Gary. Then I asked Gary to add another business line&#13;
which didn't exist to the same extent in the Bank, which was developing systematically&#13;
the capital markets . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . the capital markets being essentially safer systems than banking&#13;
systems, in that they actually demand a higher degree of discipline. And I always&#13;
thought it was better for countries to have both a banking system and a capital markets&#13;
system. So that's . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So you mean insurance and pensions and . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, developing new bond issuance practice by the government;&#13;
primary dealers; corporate bond markets; commercial paper markets; systematically&#13;
developing these other circuits. And that had nothing to do with the Washington&#13;
Consensus. Actually, I've never known what the Washington Consensus was until&#13;
[John] Williamson produced an article where he listed ten obvious things to do . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . as being part of a consensus, when they were actually all common&#13;
sense [â&#128;&#156;What Washington Means by Policy Reform,â&#128;? in John Williamson, ed., Latin&#13;
American Adjustment: How Much Has Happened?]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: If you had an ailing banking sector, of course, you had to reform it. You&#13;
didn't have to be told by a Washington Consensus for those types . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, it's like so many things. It sums up what everyone has been thinking.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: But it becomes easy for people to grasp. I think of it in the same way that&#13;
George Kennan after the Second World War wrote this very famous memo that outlined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
what everyone came to call containment in dealing with the Soviet Union [â&#128;&#156;The Sources&#13;
of Soviet Conduct,â&#128;? Foreign Affairs, July 1947].&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, right, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And it's a document that Kennan himself didn't recognize after a while&#13;
because . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and it was a very short piece.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, and other people took and read into it.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And Williamson . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . had the sameâ&#128;&#148;has exactly the same experience that the document took&#13;
on a life of its own.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Where we may have been more Washington Consensus-like was in the&#13;
privatization area . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . where we actually were sucked into massive privatization by what&#13;
happened in the USSR. And so, there, we ended up with a stellar team of privatization&#13;
experts lead by John [R.] Nellis and Ira [W.] Lieberman, and we sort of wrote the book&#13;
on it in a way in times of great experimentation. And that was a very, very strong team,&#13;
which may have had a Washington Consensus tingle to it, more so than the financial&#13;
sector development team.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, one of the things that you became interested in in this period is&#13;
information technology, and it's the Information for Development Program.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. There was a telecom division [Telecommunications and&#13;
Informatics Division] as part of what I inherited in this new vice presidency, and this&#13;
telecom division was going from public switches, and so forth, to a deregulation system.&#13;
And it was a time where computers were showing up, and new technologies were&#13;
becoming very important.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And so I almost single-handedly pushed the Bank into making a major&#13;
effort to use the new technologies for development, and that we did by creating in&#13;
1994/95 a consortium called InfoDev, Information for Development Program, which&#13;
ended up having about 15 donorsâ&#128;&#148;it still exists todayâ&#128;&#148;government donors mostly.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But for the first time in the Bank's history, we brought in donors like&#13;
IBM or Telecom Italia mixed with government donors, and we created this very original&#13;
Information for Development Program whose purpose was essentially to demonstrate&#13;
what you could do with the new technologies, through pilot projects. The basic&#13;
motivation was to get the whole development profession to really take an interest in the&#13;
power of these technologies for health and nutrition, for environmental management, for&#13;
education, distance learning, and so forth. So that was a little revolution in the Bank&#13;
because the Bank had not been interested in this until that time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: McNamara had said telephones were a luxury, and so this was a way of&#13;
showing . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, who did you put in charge of this? Who ran this for you?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I ended up putting in charge a Brazilian called Carlos [Alberto Primo]&#13;
Braga, who ran it for many years. And it becameâ&#128;&#148;it raised $50 million, and became a&#13;
real leverage player in that whole field. The InfoDev program acquired a strong brand&#13;
name, all over the world.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You say it still exists. What still needs to be done?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Itâ&#128;&#153;s moved from piloting the technologies toward supporting incubation&#13;
systems for new enterprises created around these technologies. So it's moving into a&#13;
very different mode, but it's still around, and it still has a very good team.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I promised not to keep you beyond an hour-and-a-half, so we have just a&#13;
few more minutes here for today. Another effort that you spearheaded was the Business&#13;
Partners for Development Program. How did thatâ&#128;&#148;well, first of all, you know, what do&#13;
you think the accomplishments were there, and what were the frustrations with that?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, we were among the pioneers on thisâ&#128;&#148;in the Bank, we were among&#13;
the only parties that were systematically wanting to speak to the big companies, as&#13;
exemplified by InfoDev. But I even further than that: I took an interest in trying to&#13;
demonstrate that you could do a lot of things in developing countries through a tri-sector&#13;
partnership between multinationals, NGOs, and governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And to prove that point, with a few colleagues, we created a big symposium on these tri-&#13;
sector partnerships. And some 800 people came from all over the world, but only eight&#13;
people from the Bank showed up, which shows you how uninteresting people thought&#13;
that topic of enterprises becoming involved in corporate social responsibility was at the&#13;
time in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And the symposium was so successfulâ&#128;&#148;and this actually coincides with Wolfensohn&#13;
arrivingâ&#128;&#148;that I launched, with the help of the Business Leader Forum of the Prince of&#13;
Wales, called the International Business Leader Forum, an effort that was called&#13;
Business Partnership for Development, B-P-D, in which we marshaled together some&#13;
120 players, of which there were 70 multinationals, and organized them around four&#13;
clusters.&#13;
&#13;
One cluster was traffic safety. One cluster was social development program around oil&#13;
fields and mines. A third one had to do with water for the poorest people, and the fourth&#13;
one was youth development.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: For each of the so-called clusters, the idea was that they would select&#13;
projects where they would work together between multinationals, foundations, NGOs&#13;
and local governments, with the Bank's sort of mid-wife role, and that we would&#13;
document how these experiments had worked and draw the lessons from this way of&#13;
working in tri-sector partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, where did this idea come from? I mean, where did you . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was an idea that was stirring a little bit in the business world, in the&#13;
Prince of Wales Business Leader Forum . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . or in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. But&#13;
the idea had never been taken up by an actor like the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: IFC didn't . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, IFC was completely out of it and hadn't sniffed it out at all. It caught&#13;
up later. IFC was not very visionary in this area at all, nor was it visionary in the new&#13;
technologies field.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Actually, I was always thought IFC was a disappointing player in those&#13;
days, in general. They had a lot of mileage in front of them, but they didn'tâ&#128;&#148;they were&#13;
not very bold.&#13;
&#13;
Anyhow, this BPD experiment ended up with some 30 projects for about the tune of $45&#13;
million, and as many countries, and was actually documented. And there's a book&#13;
written about what happened to these projects.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who did that? Did you do the book or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The book was done, I think, by Price Waterhouse or KPMG, for the Bank&#13;
and the IBLF.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I'm interested in this. I'll try to find that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And there is someone in the Bank whom I hired who was the then&#13;
director from Action Aid and who is still here. He's called Nigel Twose, and Nigel came&#13;
over to the Bank and has run this program even after I left for Paris.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see, okay.&#13;
.&#13;
RISCHARD: And he did the debriefing on this.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, I'm going to stop it here because it's five o'clock . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . and you said you've had a long day, so we'll pick up tomorrow. And it's&#13;
good point to stop because it's right before Wolfensohn arrives.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and weâ&#128;&#148;yes. It's indeed the Wolfensohn point we're at now.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, good afternoon. Today is Tuesday, February 28, 2006, and I'm&#13;
William Becker, at the World Bank, at the Oral History Program in its Archives. And&#13;
I'm here today again with Jean-Francois Rischard, and so it's nice to see you again.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I'm Jean-Francois Rischard. I used to be vice president for Private&#13;
Sector and Financial Sector Development, and vice president for Europe, and I retired a&#13;
few months ago, and I'm being interviewed for a second time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Very good. It's nice to see you again.&#13;
&#13;
I wanted to just follow up a little bit about your tenure as the vice president for Private&#13;
Sector Finance and Private Sector [Finance and Private Sector Development]â&#128;&#148;and&#13;
yesterday you gave me a paper, which I must say in my research I had not seen before. I&#13;
was happy to read it last night and it's the paper on synchronizing the World Bank with&#13;
the world economy, and you wrote this in 19 . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: '94.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . 1994, yes. What was the context of having written this paper?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was in a very difficult context where there was the 50th anniversary of&#13;
the World Bank, and it was centered around the 1994 Annual Meetings in Madrid. And&#13;
the Bank was being criticized by everyone, by NGOs, by the business sector as well, by&#13;
the American government and other governments. It was completely beleaguered in&#13;
1994.&#13;
&#13;
And I think it was Sven Sandstrom, who was a managing director, who asked one of the&#13;
central vice presidents, Armeane Choksi, to come up with a sort of vision statement for&#13;
the Bank, to try to come up with some sort of response and a vision of where the Bank&#13;
would be going. And they produced that paper, which I called the no vision paper&#13;
because it had only motherhood and apple pie in itâ&#128;&#148;be close to the clients, be good, be&#13;
this, be that, but there was nothing tangible in it.&#13;
&#13;
So I wrote an alternative vision which I called "Synchronizing the World Bank with the&#13;
New World Economy" because I felt the world was changing a lot and the Bank wasn't&#13;
changing with it. And in that paper, I was describing four banksâ&#128;&#148;the money bank; the&#13;
macroeconomic advice bank; the connector bank, which was the ancestor of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
knowledge bank; and the fiduciary bank. And I was describing how the Bank had to&#13;
change to be good at these four functions.&#13;
&#13;
And that paper circulated a little bit in the Bank, and when Lew Preston died the U.S.&#13;
government set up a little task force to look at various candidates for his replacement;&#13;
there were seven or eight candidates for replacing Preston. And Jan Piercy was the U.S.&#13;
executive director then.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: She gave the paper to each of the candidates, and so I had discussions&#13;
with the would-be candidates, with some of them, on that paper, with Michael [E.]&#13;
Porter, for instance, who was very excited by the ideas in the paper. And I even was&#13;
dispatched to New York to have a discussion with candidate Wolfensohn in his office.&#13;
&#13;
And so that paper may have been a little bit influential. To the extent Jim Wolfensohn&#13;
read it, it had some of the elements which he later pushed, like the knowledge bank,&#13;
which I then used to call the connector bank (I still think connector bank is actually a&#13;
better label than knowledge bank).&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, okay, because that was my next question. What was the influence of&#13;
this on Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, I assume he was impacted by it--even though he would never admit&#13;
to having been influenced by it--but I think it had an influence because it came up early&#13;
in the formation of his thinking and of the other candidates' thinking.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Who were some of the other candidates? I mean, Porter is . . .&#13;
RISCHARD: There was a Mexican and a U.S. ambassador to Mexico whose name I&#13;
can't remember, and a few other names. I don't knowâ&#128;&#148;I cannot remember all eight&#13;
names.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, okay, okay. It's sort of interesting that Porter was interested. It's the&#13;
kind of thing thatâ&#128;&#148;I mean, he's very much interested in structures, obviously.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. Porter would have been a very interesting candidate, but Jim&#13;
Wolfensohn had so many connections and other things going for him that . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Talking about a connector bank, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . he move ahead of all the other candidates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, as [Sebastian] Mallaby makes quite clear in his book [The Worldâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Banker: A Story of Failed States, Financial Crises, and the Wealth and Poverty of&#13;
Nations], yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Well, speaking about Mr. Wolfensohn, I wanted to talk a little bit about&#13;
when he first came here, and also his initial efforts, or his early efforts, to look at&#13;
reorganizing the Bank yet again.&#13;
&#13;
And you were appointed, with Caio [K.] Koch-Weser, as the head of one of the working&#13;
groups. Could you talk a little bit about your working group and the larger steering&#13;
committee, and how this whole effort worked?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I think Jim came in in May '95 or June '95, and he was questioning&#13;
many things at the Bank without necessarily knowing exactly why he was questioning it,&#13;
but he was questioning things.&#13;
&#13;
And so early on, in Augustâ&#128;&#148;I remember I was on holiday in Corsicaâ&#128;&#148;I got a call from&#13;
Gautam [S.] Kaji, who was one of the managing directors, saying, â&#128;&#156;Jim wants to have a&#13;
look at the structure of the Bank, the way the organization functions, and I want you to&#13;
be part of that effort.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
And the idea was that there would be two pairs of vice presidents setting up two parallel&#13;
groups to work at the issue of the organization and the staffing of the Bank. My pair was&#13;
myself and Caio Koch-Weser. The other group was Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham, one of&#13;
the vice presidents, and Johannes [F.] Linn, another vice president. They were going to&#13;
look more into staffing issues, the quality of staff and so forth, how careers should be&#13;
run, career development, whilst we were going to look at the structure.&#13;
&#13;
And we were not given any detailed marching orders, so with Caio we decided to select&#13;
20 people in the Bank, with the sole criterion being that they were creative, interesting,&#13;
curious people that could help brain-storm in a deep way what the Bank should become&#13;
in the future.&#13;
&#13;
And so we selected 20 extraordinary characters. Praful [C.] Patel, Andrew Rogerson,&#13;
Jane Armitage were among them, and there was many others. And we retreated with the&#13;
group of 20 people to the Watergate Hotel, and essentially cooped up there for two or&#13;
three weeks in the hotelâ&#128;&#153;s mediocre internal conference rooms.&#13;
&#13;
And I had the idea with Caio to bring in McKinsey [&amp; Company] to help us--not to tell&#13;
us what to do but to tell us how other companies had gone through the process of&#13;
rethinking themselves. And so we spent two, three weeks there, and we produced what I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
still consider today to be a fantastic analysis of the Bank and its weaknesses and of&#13;
where it should be going.&#13;
&#13;
The first slideâ&#128;&#148;there were 16 slides which were very masterful, actually, I mean, the&#13;
McKinsey people thought they were really very high-quality--the first slide was a&#13;
harrowing slide that showed the Bank declining the next ten yearsâ&#128;&#148;that was one&#13;
scenarioâ&#128;&#148;or the Bank becoming again the premier development institution. It was at a&#13;
crossroads.&#13;
&#13;
And then it was followed by slides that were essentially proposing to do two things: to&#13;
decentralize the country directors into the field, so that those that were strategizing with&#13;
countries and for countries would be close to their clients, and at the same time do&#13;
something to concentrate again the sort of worldwide knowledge of the Bank into strong&#13;
technical vice presidencies. Those were the two points, and then there were many other&#13;
points going with it. Even though the other team was dealing with staffing, its vision&#13;
resembled and validated ours.&#13;
&#13;
And we worked out these 16 slides, and after having done that, some of us were asked to&#13;
go to New York to Mr. Wolfensohn's private office. And on a Sunday or a Saturdayâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
can't rememberâ&#128;&#148;Caio and I presented the 16 slides, and the other teams presented&#13;
theirs. And the President took a deep breath, seeing what we had to do and the&#13;
magnitude of what we had to do, and didn't really react by saying, â&#128;&#156;Let's do it.â&#128;? He&#13;
wanted to let it sink in first.&#13;
&#13;
Then there was a period where we were not sure where we were standing. As I said, the&#13;
other group came out, even though they were studying different things, with roughly the&#13;
same conclusions, which was a nice way of validating the thoughts because it was&#13;
almost like a double-blind test.&#13;
&#13;
And there was a difficult meeting with the whole senior management team in the Hay-&#13;
Adams Hotel where we explained what we were going to do. That session was preceded&#13;
by a sort of exploration of the overall strategic environment of the Bank by Moises Naim&#13;
and Mark [William] Baird.&#13;
&#13;
And it was a rough meetingâ&#128;&#148;I think it's described in the Mallaby bookâ&#128;&#148;in the sense&#13;
that Wolfensohn didn't clearly come out indicating what he wanted to do, whether he&#13;
was in line with what we were saying needed to be done, and so he gave the impression&#13;
that he was not completely backing us. At the same time, there was a whole day of&#13;
discussion on changing the Bank, and a few vice presidents were actually negative about&#13;
the plan. Some were positive, but it was a sort of murky atmosphere.&#13;
&#13;
But somehow, a few weeks later, we were dispatched to the Board to explain what was&#13;
going to happen. So we didn't get wholehearted support, but at the same time we kept&#13;
going through the motions. And at the Board--I remember I was the one presenting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
slides to the Boardâ&#128;&#148;the Executive Directors were stunned in the same way Wolfensohn&#13;
had been stunned in New York by the boldness of what was being proposed and the&#13;
number of things being proposed and the depth of things being proposed.&#13;
&#13;
And I will remember that Board session a long time. It was three hours' worth, with the&#13;
Board again, as I said, taking a deep breath, not quite knowing what to do with all this,&#13;
but sort of trusting our judgment.&#13;
&#13;
In this murky period, the question also had come up as to how to communicate all these&#13;
plans to the staff. The managing directors thought that we should not show the blueprint&#13;
because we shouldn't give people the impression that there was an imposed blueprint.&#13;
And so instead of that, there were focus groups organized around the Bank based on a&#13;
very short, highly abstract slide show saying we would be close to the customers and&#13;
technically good. So, again, motherhood and apple pie, but not really showing the&#13;
goods.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And those focus groupsâ&#128;&#148;there were dozens and dozens of them&#13;
throughout the Bankâ&#128;&#148;happened in an atmosphere where people were a little bit worried&#13;
about the whole thing. I was of the opinion that we should show the full blueprint and&#13;
the slides to everyone, and I actually violated the rules and did a few focus groups of my&#13;
own with the slides!&#13;
&#13;
And each time I did that in a few departments, such as the Legal Department, people&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Oh, this is interesting,â&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;How can we help?â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Maybe you could do this this&#13;
way.â&#128;? People became problem-solvers when they saw the blueprint and wanted to fine-&#13;
tune it, as opposed to what happened in the other focus groups, where people just&#13;
thought we were hiding something . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . because we weren't being detailed about what was happening. So that,&#13;
I think, was a big mistake in communication.&#13;
&#13;
And the murkiness continued. There was a town meeting where the staff was getting&#13;
anxious about all of this and where Caio Koch-Weser was up there on stage explaining&#13;
again what the principles were for this new organization, and where Wolfensohn sort of&#13;
taking distance from Caio saying, â&#128;&#156;I'm Chirac,â&#128;? meaning Jacques Chirac.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And where he pointed to Caio Koch-Weser saying, â&#128;&#156;And he is [Alain]&#13;
Juppe,â&#128;? who was the sort of unhappy prime minister at the time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And so things continued in this sort of murky fashion, but at the same&#13;
time the decision was made at some point to use Africa as a guinea pig for the new&#13;
blueprint. And one of the central vice presidenciesâ&#128;&#148;I think the one for Human&#13;
Development [and Operations Policy]â&#128;&#148;was also going to be ahead of the others in&#13;
modeling these changes.&#13;
&#13;
And these changes had a matrix in which Regional vice presidencies dealt with technical&#13;
vice presidencies. The latter were called networks, and there was a big fight about that.&#13;
I wanted the networks to be like worldwide consulting firms or high-quality practices,&#13;
and I wanted all the technical staff of a particular featherâ&#128;&#148;private sector staff, human&#13;
development staff, environmental staffâ&#128;&#148;to report to the network vice presidents&#13;
wherever they sat in the world, whether they were working for this or that Region. In&#13;
my vision, the technical staffâ&#128;&#153;s first reporting relationship would be to their technical&#13;
family, and the network head would be the head of the family. Similarly, in my vision,&#13;
the Regional vice presidents would have bought the services from these technical vice&#13;
presidencies, and they would have judged their technical vice presidents on the merits of&#13;
their deliveries.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And also the Regional vice presidents would have been decentralized with a&#13;
good deal of authority of their own.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, in any case, but they would have had more authority to decide&#13;
which projects to do . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . what strategy to pursue in the countries. Their powers would have&#13;
been augmented, of course, which was the general idea, but they would not have owned&#13;
technical troops. They would only have owned a small staff of strategists and country&#13;
economists. So their job would have to be the strategists and to liaison with the&#13;
countries. But they would have held the bulk of the operational budget, that is, they&#13;
would have had a lot of power.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And that blueprint, which to this day I think was the right one, was not&#13;
adopted. And when I was on vacation againâ&#128;&#148;this must have been a year later or&#13;
sometime laterâ&#128;&#148;I was on vacation again in Corsica. When I came back, Caio and others&#13;
had pushed a hybrid version of the matrix in which the technical staff remained in the&#13;
Regional vice presidencies, so that their first allegiance was to the Regional vice&#13;
presidency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
But with their left hand, they had to report to a network head, who actually was now&#13;
more like a trade union leader than a real boss. And I thought that design was very&#13;
neither here nor there, and that it would lead to an erosion in the skills of staff because I&#13;
didn't trust the Regional vice presidents to hire world-class people. Even if the network&#13;
had encouraged them along these lines, they would still sort of hire local staff, and not&#13;
go for worldwide quality.&#13;
&#13;
So that was a debate. Caio Koch-Weser was for that hybrid version. I was for the clean&#13;
version, and I lost the battle. And as I lost it, the Bank lost it, too, because a lot of the&#13;
erosion in the quality of staff that has happened since, in the last ten years, came from&#13;
that hybrid, neither here nor there design, of which I'm very critical to this day.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. Now, did you ever talk to Wolfensohn about why he made the&#13;
decision that he made on this or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Wolfensohn never understood the nature of the matrix. He always&#13;
thought that the way the Bank had been structured was my way. He always thought the&#13;
network heads could decide to double education lending and that this decision would&#13;
then be readily executed. He always thought the network vice-presidents were very&#13;
powerful people, but we were not. He never understood that the technical staff remained&#13;
under the primary allegiance toward the Regional vice president, except for the small&#13;
central units which were called anchors that were under the network heads.&#13;
&#13;
And so Wolfensohn never understood the fine details of this, never probably really cared&#13;
about them. And to this day, I think he misunderstood what was actually happening and&#13;
that he would have been on my side had he been more studious in terms of discussing&#13;
the two models.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, he was early on focused on the managing directors and the people that&#13;
he had around him. Is that what happened, that his focus just got off of this&#13;
reorganization and he focused on more or less the people that reported directly to him or&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: He focused on big themes like poverty . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . or fighting corruption. He was traveling a lot. He was a fantastic&#13;
president from an external standpoint, and he rebuilt the image of the Bank, which was&#13;
very damaged by 1994. But he was never very deeply immersed in the managerial&#13;
details of how the organization runs, how it should be structured. He left that to the&#13;
managing directors, criticizing the managing directors when he thought it wasn't going&#13;
well, but rarely intervening in the decisions themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                      February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In this proposal that came out of these meetings in '95â&#128;&#148;in the paper on&#13;
synchronizing the World Bank with the world economy, it had what I would think would&#13;
be an interesting/controversial idea about the whole civil service mentality of staff&#13;
careers at the Bank. Was that a source of some discontent, orâ&#128;&#148;the question is did that&#13;
end up in the report?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, it didn't, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, that's a very interesting set of ideas.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and they never made their way into the other group that was looking&#13;
at staffing. What the other group did is to try to have two career tracks, one career track&#13;
that would lead to managerial ranks and one that could be a technical track where you&#13;
could go very high up in the salary grades, but as a technical guruâ&#128;&#148;a good idea, but&#13;
which was not really executed the right way.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. So I want to follow up on this and talk a little bit about what you call&#13;
the connector bank, and what Wolfensohn called the knowledge bank. Now, he or more&#13;
or less bought into your ideas, or the ideas that your group had proposed on this. Is that&#13;
correct?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: You remember I had been one of the pioneers in the Bank on using the&#13;
new technologies for development. . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . this InfoDev example.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And actually what happenedâ&#128;&#148;this was 1996, so it's the second Annual&#13;
Meeting for Wolfensohn, and it so happened that a month or so before, after having&#13;
heavily insisting that the senior management team should hear from me about the new&#13;
technologies, Wolfensohn staged a meeting of all the vice presidents around a slide show&#13;
that he asked me to prepare on new technologies and development.&#13;
&#13;
And I did that, and I did it with three â&#128;&#156;witnesses.â&#128;? One was the minister of technology&#13;
in Brazil, one was the head of the Israeli Open University, and one was a Wall Street&#13;
investment banker called Bo [W. Bowman III] Cutter, who had worked in the White&#13;
House and he was very much into new technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I explained what new technologies could contribute to development and an example&#13;
of the things you could do with the technologies was to essentially turn the Bank into an&#13;
electronically accessible, systematic repository of best practices and knowledge. And I&#13;
said that we could call it a knowledge bank. I didn't use the word "connector" bank.&#13;
&#13;
And Jim, whoâ&#128;&#148;it was the first time he saw that slide show. (I must have it somewhere.&#13;
It was actually a neat slide show.) Jim got very enthusiastic about this and immediately&#13;
wanted me to set up a task force on the knowledge bank idea. In the book of Mallaby,&#13;
there's a little anecdote where Jim is in a traffic jam in New York and he calls me and&#13;
says, â&#128;&#156;There's nothing in my Annual Meeting speech,â&#128;? and I come up with the&#13;
knowledge bank idea.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I can't remember that detail very well, but it was part of what was&#13;
happening at the time. There was a colleague called Stephen [M.] Denning, who was&#13;
also pushing the knowledge bank idea separately. We sort of united forces in that task&#13;
force, gathered some 20 or so people, came up with a sort of proposal and a report. And&#13;
it sort of entered into the Annual Meeting speech, and Jim became a strong proponent of&#13;
these ideas.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: These ideas are popularâ&#128;&#148;also are developing in corporate settings in the&#13;
U.S.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. They were new at the time. They ran under the heading of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;knowledge managementâ&#128;? in the corporate world.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And we actually brought in some experts. One was called Brooke&#13;
Manvilleâ&#128;&#148;I can't remember which company he was from--who was one of the gurus of&#13;
knowledge management. And then we had some people from Price Waterhouse which&#13;
were gurus in this. And so we designed a systematic system of knowledge management&#13;
for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And in the Bank-wide organizational blueprint that we talked about earlier, knowledge&#13;
management was a component piece. The idea was that the technical vice presidencies&#13;
would have as one of their functions to maintain first-class knowledge banks in their&#13;
field. And so the knowledge management drive took off.&#13;
&#13;
In my vice presidency, I started help desks and I had people named as knowledge&#13;
managers. I think I was one of the first ones to experiment with this. And we built up&#13;
something called thematic groups, which happened, I think, in early '97 at the point&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
where the central vice presidencies became network vice presidencies. It was January,&#13;
February '97.&#13;
&#13;
The reason we invented the thematic groups was that, in my case, in my network vice&#13;
presidency, we had something like 1,300 people. It was a huge thing, so the only place I&#13;
could gather them in was some hotel on 14th Street. And when you had 1,300 people,&#13;
the question was what do you do with them?&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So we made a list of topics on charts and said room number 16 is&#13;
privatization. If you're interested in insurance reform, go to room 8. If you're interested&#13;
in highway maintenance, go to that room 24. And people flocked spontaneously to these&#13;
various rooms.&#13;
&#13;
And then we saw that these groupings were successful, we said, well, let's transform&#13;
these people into thematic clubs and make that part of the knowledge management&#13;
system. So we invented that thematic group concept, but we had a very hard time&#13;
getting the Regional vice presidents who owned the technical staff, according to the&#13;
hybrid matrix version that had been retained . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . it was hard to get the Regional vice-presidents to actually consider that&#13;
it was the duty of their technical staff to spend one or two weeks a year debriefing&#13;
themselves on the best practices. They always thought knowledge management was a&#13;
futile thing and that time devoted to this was â&#128;&#156;stolen awayâ&#128;? from operations.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: This was one of the casualties of this very ill-thought-through design that&#13;
Caio and others pushed.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, were there other thematic areas [inaudible]?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In my vice presidency of Finance and Private Sector Development, we&#13;
had 32 thematic groups, and then the other vice presidencies had another equal number&#13;
of them. But we had lots of them because we had so many technical specialties.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, overall, how do you think this has worked? I mean, this is right&#13;
before the Internet explodes, and so you're sort of ahead of the technology in a way&#13;
because once the technology is there, it becomes easier to do these things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Actually, the technology was part of it, but the most successful device&#13;
was not a website. The most successful device was the help desk, where you could call&#13;
the highway people, for instance, from anywhere in the world and ask them what were&#13;
the six best surfacing methods for highways or the best toll systems, to call and find out&#13;
what had worked in which country and what hadn't.&#13;
&#13;
That was the main topic. You needed to have staff who were manning these help desks&#13;
or a knowledge manager that would systematically get out of the highway gurus all this&#13;
practical knowledge on how to do things, where are the best consultants, which are the&#13;
best books to read, the best articles, the best case studies, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
So technology was part of it, but it was not . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Not the driver.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . the central idea. The central idea was to create a culture where it was&#13;
the duty of every technical staff to produce and store knowledge for the house. And we&#13;
must have done OKâ&#128;&#148;the early motions must have been the right ones because we got&#13;
many awards from the corporate world for being ahead of other firms in knowledge&#13;
management. And I remember trooping around giving lectures in Paris to Suez and&#13;
other big companies about how to become good at knowledge management.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But because of this ill-thought-through matrix structure, the system&#13;
actually fell apart because the Regional vice presidents never let the technical staff&#13;
reporting to them devote serious time for this. They never could see the merits for the&#13;
Bank being very good as a knowledge bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I worked on a history of Coopers and Lybrand, the accounting firm, and&#13;
they around this time right, before they merged withâ&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, it might have been Coopers.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . because they had a vice chairman and her job basically was to do this&#13;
kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I think I may have met her, and there was another man from, I think&#13;
it was Coopers that helped us think that through.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. They were leaders in that, and then, of course, they merged with Price&#13;
Waterhouse.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, that's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And I don't know what ever happened to any of them, actually. We wrote&#13;
this history for their 100th anniversary and they swore they were ready for another 100&#13;
years, and within months of the thing . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: They were gone.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER:. . .they were gone. So, anyway, that's the way these things work.&#13;
&#13;
I want to move on to your next vice presidency, but before doing that, the timing is close&#13;
enough to the Southeast Asian financial crisis, I want to just change the subject just for a&#13;
few seconds here.&#13;
&#13;
Since you had been involved with the debt crisis in the '80s with the Baker and the&#13;
Brady Plans, how do you think theâ&#128;&#148;in view of your earlier experience in the '80s, how&#13;
do you think the Bank dealt with the crises in Mexico in '94 and '95 . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And then the big one in â&#128;&#153;97-'98.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . and then the big one in '97-'98, and then also the Russian problems?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, first, I have to backtrack . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . and say that the central vice presidency I had started in early '93 had&#13;
roughly 300 people . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . and went very well. And they were highly booked, very sought-after,&#13;
very expert. It was a wonderful team, and it was working fast, quick response, and so&#13;
forth, a very popular outfit.&#13;
&#13;
In early '97, those central vice presidencies morphed into the network vice presidencies.&#13;
So I went from 300 people to 1,300.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And those peopleâ&#128;&#148;they were not really my staff. I was at best a sort of&#13;
trade union leader. We had to create a sort of network council, with delegates from all&#13;
the Regions. So you had sort of board meetings. And within your vice presidency, there&#13;
were several departments. I had actually four departments by thenâ&#128;&#148;urban and transport,&#13;
private sector, financial sector, industry and energy. Each one of them had to create a&#13;
sector board, which also had one guy from the central unit and one from each Region.&#13;
&#13;
So what in my old central vice presidency was very un-bureaucratic and was like a&#13;
consulting firm, and a good one, became a sort of bureaucratic thing with sector board&#13;
meetings and council meetings. And I remember my job changing completelyâ&#128;&#148;I was a&#13;
real business leader in my first job, whereas in my second job, my main function was to&#13;
constantly beg the Regional vice presidents to pay attention to knowledge management,&#13;
to give us resources to perform global initiatives, to be serious about the quality of the&#13;
recruitment, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
And I could beg them as much as I would. They didn't care very much about the&#13;
network vice presidencies from the start. So that poor matrix design played havoc, and&#13;
one of the casualties was not only the knowledge management system blooming and&#13;
then collapsing, but the other one was the capacity to properly handle the crisis of '97-&#13;
'98. Indeed before the crisis hit, Gary Perlin and I got very worried that the Bank and&#13;
especially the Regions, were not making enough efforts to consolidate and strengthen&#13;
banking sectors in countries. There were too many signs of stresses in the banking&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In Southeast Asia and elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: All over the world.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And we had, especially in the Regional vice-presidencies, very few staff&#13;
of the kind that could do bank supervision, reviews of banking sectors. It's very difficult&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I could see it coming that we would need many more expert staff in&#13;
that area. So I tried to convince the Regional vice presidents to give me money for a&#13;
central kitty. I needed $4 or $6 million, something like that, to hire in advance of a crisis&#13;
the pool of experts we needed, and to be ready for it.&#13;
&#13;
And I remember, as a network head, I just had no clout. I had to beg all of these people.&#13;
None of them forked over money, and I still have somewhere a memo from the vice&#13;
president for East Asia, Russ Cheetham, who turned me down by saying, â&#128;&#156;Look, I'm not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
going to give you money for this because we have no banking sector problem in my&#13;
Region.â&#128;? A few months later, his Region had the nastiest of all crises, and he had only 2&#13;
staff in that area. Famous last words.&#13;
&#13;
So that is a telling illustration of the weakness of this hybrid network concept. As a&#13;
network vice president, you had no clout, even on something as urgent as this, and even&#13;
with the support of the managing director, I was not able to marshal $4 to $6 million out&#13;
of Regional vice presidencies (that had hundreds of millions of dollars of budget) to&#13;
prepare for the eventuality of a serious set of banking crises in many countries. That was&#13;
the type of difficulty inherent in that . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: System.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . very poorly thought-through design, hybrid design.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So what did the Bankâ&#128;&#148;or did you get involved in the Bank's response?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. When Thailand got hit by its crisis in August '97, I got a call. I was&#13;
again in Corsica, and all hell was breaking loose in Bangkok.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Thailand, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And we had to literally scrambleâ&#128;&#148;well, to make things worse, senior&#13;
management had taken away Gary Perlin away from me.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Made him the treasurer?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, made him the treasurer, which was a waste of throw weight for the&#13;
Bank. He was in a much more important spot in the financial sector development&#13;
network, and he had been treasurer before, in Fannie Mae.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And the last thing he needed was to be treasurer again, but they took him&#13;
away.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. This was because Jessica Einhorn moved . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, Jessica stole him away. She became for a brief stint managing&#13;
director for Finance [and Resource Mobilization], and she took Gary as a replacement.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So I had to replace him, and it was very, very hard to replace him. And I&#13;
brought someone over from Comptrollerâ&#128;&#148;not Comptroller of the Currency, but the&#13;
outfit that was dealing with the S&amp;L crisis.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: What is it, the . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Office . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: . . Office ofâ&#128;&#148;it's Thriftâ&#128;¦&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . Thrift Supervision, OTS or something.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: He was called Jonathan [L.] Fiechter, a towering man, huge, six, seven&#13;
feet tall, maybe more. And he came over and, like me, was very worried about not&#13;
having enough staff. And then the crisis hit in August â&#128;&#152;97, and I had to send Jonathan&#13;
and the teams literally overnight to Thailand, together with the IMF rescue team. And&#13;
when they arrived in Thailand, there was pandemonium. The central bank was empty.&#13;
Everyone was on sick leave. The ministers were denying any responsibility. No one&#13;
knew what to do with the so-called finance companies. They were all going bust. There&#13;
were some 59 of them. We had to close them overnight, with the Fund. It was&#13;
extremely difficult work under duress, under high-speed conditions.&#13;
&#13;
And then Thailand was followed by a crash in Korea and in Indonesia, and the small&#13;
troops we had were completely stretched, and I really regretted then not having gotten&#13;
the money I was looking for from the Regional vice presidents to set up a pool of crisis&#13;
management experts. And then I went to the Board, with the help of the managing&#13;
directors, and got $25 million allocated to a Crisis Management Unit, like that, on top of&#13;
the so-called Strategic Compact, which had allocated lots of money to the changes that&#13;
Wolfensohn was making.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And we booted up a sort of special, intensiveâ&#128;&#148;sort of intensive care unit&#13;
for financial sector. And I had to contact many central bankers in the world to get some&#13;
staff seconded to that team to be able to hold the fort. So these were very, very tough&#13;
times, and I worked very closely on these things together with another network vice&#13;
president who was called Masood Ahmed, who was running the economic management&#13;
network [Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network]. Together, we tried&#13;
to hold the fort as best we could, but it was a high-anxiety time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes. I lived in Singapore at the time and so literally could watch what&#13;
was happening. The Singapore press doesn't cover Singapore very well, but it covers all&#13;
the neighbors very well.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, and actually I remember early in January '98 Korea had reserves&#13;
down to $1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: A week more and Korea would have had a bankruptcy problem.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And what had happened in Korea is when the trouble started in Thailand,&#13;
the problem was the finance companiesâ&#128;&#148;but in the case of Korea, it was more of a&#13;
chaebol problem.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In Indonesia, it was more of a problem of the private sector people taking&#13;
on a lot of foreign debt.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And what happened . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And a very weak banking sector.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . a very weak banking sector . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . but also a terrible over-indebtedness of the private sector, which no one&#13;
knew about, and brutal capital movements. I think wealthy individuals in Indonesia&#13;
moved $42 billion out of the country and put it into Singapore in a few weeksâ&#128;&#153; time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Anyway, we held the fort as we could, working with the Fund a lot and&#13;
the central banks, but these were harrowing times.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Now, from all of this, has the Bank learned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. I think the Bank has kept on to this hybrid structure, which has led&#13;
to a massive erosion of the skills of the Bank. In other terms, the world-class skills of&#13;
the type I had in my old central vice presidency, that's hard to find today. And you have&#13;
too many task managers. There are 1,500 of them. They should be only a very small&#13;
group. There are no mentors for the young technical staff.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of hiring the world's best mortgage finance specialist, the Regional vice-&#13;
presidents hire someone, say, in the Delhi office because he knows about the Indian&#13;
banking sector. Not a chance in hell he or she will be a world class expert. The hiring&#13;
practices and the quality maintenance practices have deteriorated, and I think this hybrid&#13;
structure has caused very great damage to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank didn't learn anything from this, and they should have learned, if anything,&#13;
from the financial crisis where, clearly, had I been able to get the money ahead of time, I&#13;
would have been much more prepared to do this rescue work than we were with this&#13;
hybrid structure, in which Regional vice presidents who don't know anything about&#13;
financial sectors were deciding whether or not to add staff.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: In the case of East Asia, not only did the man tell me he had no problem,&#13;
but when the sâ&#128;¦ hit the fan, you recall he had only two or three staff in the financial&#13;
sector area in East Asia. It was extremely weakly staffed, and it was a real disaster.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, the Bank worked with the Fund in this effort. You haven't mentioned&#13;
much about the Fund. Did you have many contacts with the Fund?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, we had many contacts with the so-called [International] Capital&#13;
Markets Department, and many joint meetings, and all the missions were joint. So it&#13;
was our bank supervisor-types going out with the more macroeconomic financial sector&#13;
specialists of the Fund, and we were working hand in hand. I had many, many meetings&#13;
and joint approaches.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, Thailand has worked out pretty well. They did reorganize the&#13;
banking sector. Indonesia is still troubled.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Korea worked its way out of that, but to what do you attribute that? I mean,&#13;
actually Thailand turned around within a year, I would think.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Actually, they all turned around. When you look at the statistics, they all&#13;
had big drops in GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And within a year-and-a-half, they were back. But they all started&#13;
working at consolidating their banking sectors, some better than others. But we never&#13;
could stop because as soon as Asia was finished, Russia was in trouble.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And then you had Brazil . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Brazil, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . surprisingly, but Brazil was actually more of a shallow crisis because&#13;
we had done a lot of work beforehand to strengthen the banking sector. So in that case,&#13;
it was much less serious than [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And Russia ended up being more a Fund problem.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Russia was partly a problem around the issuance of government bonds.&#13;
And the weakness of the banking sector was glaringâ&#128;&#148;that we knew, and we actually had&#13;
tried to develop a much stronger banking sector in the form of something called the&#13;
International Standard Bank. So each crisis was slightly different, but they all had the&#13;
financial sector component.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in September of that year, a new vice presidency is created and you're&#13;
it. How did that come about, the Vice Presidency for Europe, in September of . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. Actually, that's early '98, I think.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, okay. I had September, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: What had happened is actually I hadâ&#128;&#148;even though I was the private&#13;
sector vice president--a lot of links with Brussels and the president of the [European]&#13;
Commission at the time, who was called Jacques Santer. And I had repeatedly pushed&#13;
Bank management to create the Brussels office to be close to the European Commission&#13;
and the European Investment Bank, which are actually the biggest multilateral partner&#13;
we have. And so I had been instrumental in getting the Brussels office started, and it&#13;
was started up by the External Affairs Department.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But that was maybe '96 or '97, something like that [inaudible]. And then&#13;
in early '98, I had been a private sector vice president for five-and-a-half years already.&#13;
So I was beginning to get tired of the business, and, particularly, I disliked this network&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
vice presidency mode, where I had to constantly chair council meetings and sector board&#13;
meetings, and always beg the Regional vice presidents for attention, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
By contrast, I had really loved my early days as a central vice president. I didn't like so&#13;
much the network vice president, and the other network vice presidents didn't like their&#13;
lives either. So one day I wrote a list to Sven Sandstrom, just on a piece of paper, listing&#13;
four options for my next move. One was to be an operations vice president in IFC. One&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;I had been offered to be the East Asia vice president two years before, but I wasn't&#13;
interested.&#13;
&#13;
One was to beâ&#128;&#148;I can't remember what the other two were, but the fourth was to become&#13;
a vice president for Europe, working out of Europe, an off-the-cuff idea as it were. Sven&#13;
gave that list of four options to Wolfensohn before the spring meetings of '98, and&#13;
Wolfensohn immediately liked the idea of a European vice presidency and of making a&#13;
special effort to get close to the European shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Some of the largest single groups, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Oh, 30 percent of the capital . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . against 16, 17 percent to the U.S., but they had never realized that they&#13;
were that big a shareholder collectively. And so Wolfensohn so liked the idea that he&#13;
announced it to the visiting EU ministers that were coming to the spring meeting, giving&#13;
me just a few hours to tell my wife that I had a new job ahead. [Laughter.] And that we&#13;
were moving to Paris within a few months.&#13;
&#13;
So we created, with Mark Malloch Brown, who was running the External Affairs&#13;
Department [Vice Presidency], and who was by then, I think, a vice presidentâ&#128;&#148;yes, he&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;we concocted the creation of a European vice presidency based on the Brussels&#13;
office which I had started to [prompt?] the Paris office, which had been there since the&#13;
war, and the London office, which was very small.&#13;
&#13;
And so I essentially redesigned that series of offices into a real [little?] vice presidency,&#13;
but it was a small, embedded vice presidency contained within the External Affairs Vice&#13;
Presidency. We later added a Rome office, under the pressure of the Italian&#13;
shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So I went from the biggest vice presidency of 1,300 people to the&#13;
smallest one, with about 60, 70 people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Let me ask you a frank question here. Obviously, you were unhappy about&#13;
the network vice presidency. Did you make your unhappiness known to Wolfensohn or&#13;
was that . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. I was just getting tired of it, and after five-and-a-half years in the&#13;
job, I wanted to do something else.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I mean, you didn't have the sense that this was a way to get you out of his&#13;
hair or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. I actually always got along well with him. He may have found me&#13;
wanting as a network vice president. That could be, but we foundâ&#128;&#148;everyone found all&#13;
the network vice presidents wanting because they had such a thankless task. And my&#13;
FPSI vice-presidency had a huge scope, representing that of three vice-presidencies&#13;
today. So I don't know. Maybe it was part of that, but I think he really wanted to do&#13;
something special for Europe.&#13;
&#13;
And actually, once I was in that Europe job, I got very close to him, and we did a lot of&#13;
things together. I think it was particularly my wanting to move on, but it may have been&#13;
in a context where they may have wanted to do some changes at any rate, in which case&#13;
my Europe idea preempted things to come.&#13;
&#13;
Actually, when I left, what they did is they took this huge vice presidency I had and they&#13;
carved into three pieces and gave it to three vice presidents. So my successorsâ&#128;&#148;there&#13;
were three of them, and indeed for one person it was a hard job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Too much.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: You had to jump from financial sector to urban projects, to transport, to&#13;
energy. You had to know about everything, and it was possibly too big a job.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: In my looking at this, reading about this, one of the pieces I saw said that it&#13;
wasâ&#128;&#148;this was not an expansion, but really a shift in focus of what the Bank had been&#13;
doing in Europe. It also strikes me that this is a very, very large mandate to, what, 30-&#13;
plus countries that are in your . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, it was fascinating. The mandate was to get the Bank and Europe&#13;
much closer to each other as the largest shareholder, but the shareholder who didn't&#13;
know it was the largest shareholder, and representingâ&#128;&#148;55 percent of IDA was from&#13;
Europeâ&#128;&#148;the biggest bilateral systems, the most influential ones like DFID [Department&#13;
for International Development] in the UK and the Dutch. They were very important.&#13;
The Scandinavian . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . shareholders were important. The Dutch were key trust fund&#13;
providers. So there was a lot to do, and I designed a sort of program to make the vice&#13;
presidency a very happy, ambitious one, even though it was small and embedded. And I&#13;
even got some money out of the budget people for doing it. And so I took what I had&#13;
and I added a little bit of money, and we multiplied what we were doing in Europe by&#13;
four or five in a very short time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, what kind of things did you do to improve these relationsâ&#128;&#148;well, first&#13;
of all, it's a job to sort of clarify the Europeans' own identity in terms of development&#13;
and all the efforts that they were making.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. We actually helped do that as well.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It was interesting how we did more in that sense than the European&#13;
Commission itself. Often, I would go to countries explaining what was going on in&#13;
development and their own role with their own bilateral system, and what we thought of&#13;
it. And they said, â&#128;&#156;Well, it's interesting; the Commission never told us that, but it's&#13;
coming from you.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
So we had several business lines. One business line was to intensify the country&#13;
dialogue with individual European shareholders, and I did a lot of that. I would be every&#13;
week somewhere else, in Portugal, in Iceland, in Greece, in Ireland . . . explaining the&#13;
Bank, explaining the stakes, raising money, forming partnerships with the countries. In&#13;
each country, I would often see the prime minister, sometimes the president, the&#13;
development minister, the finance minister, the NGO community, the business&#13;
associations, the parliamentarians, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Either I would do it, or I would get Jim to come five, six times a year and do it. And we&#13;
were using different approaches depending on the country. All in all, we became very&#13;
close to the Italians, the Germans, with the French. We would visit Chirac. We would&#13;
have meetings with [Gerhard] Schroeder. Or [Silvio] Berlusconi. Or [Jose Maria]&#13;
Aznar. We ended up with very high-level relationships throughout Europe and a great&#13;
deal of influence on aid systems, on the G-8 agenda and some of the G-20 agenda, and&#13;
so forth. And we ended up with an explosion in the partnerships with the European&#13;
Commission and the European Investment Bank. So this strategic dialogue was very&#13;
important.&#13;
&#13;
Then we decided to create outreach efforts to entire constituencies, not country by&#13;
country, but to zero in, for instance, on all the European parliamentarians . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . or all the European academics. So we created something that became&#13;
a real institution, which is called the Parliamentary Network of the World Bank&#13;
(PNoWB), which we started with the European Parliamentary Conference, with Dutch&#13;
money. And today that network has a thousand parliamentarians from all over the world&#13;
that are members, and has become a sort of parliamentary assembly for the World Bank.&#13;
It started out of Europe, but now it is a global effort, managed still out of Paris.&#13;
&#13;
Then we launchedâ&#128;&#148;this was the other thing we createdâ&#128;&#148;the annual conference of&#13;
academics here that was called the ABCDE Europe Conference.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Annual Bank Conference . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: On Development Economics.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . on Development Economics. It had run for years in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And we created the European version of it, which became much more&#13;
grandiose and bigger because you always would find money for it from countries. And&#13;
so we had terrific conferences in Paris, in Brussels, in the Netherlands, in Switzerland,&#13;
attracting hundreds of academics from all over the world, to the point where today the&#13;
only ABCDE conference is that one. Itâ&#128;&#153;s organized by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s European team, even&#13;
when it goes to Tokyo, as it soon will.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: It's not here. It's there.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: It's there, and indeed this year it's going to Japan. So we started to do&#13;
things out of Europe that were global.&#13;
&#13;
The third constituency we went after was the business constituency because when I came&#13;
to Paris there was one person trying to connect the 400,000 companies regarding&#13;
procurement opportunities with the Bank, or IFC and MIGA [Multilateral Investment&#13;
Guarantee Agency] opportunities. So what I created was a network of liaison officers in&#13;
the countries. I would ask each country to donate a staff out of the trade ministry or the&#13;
business associations.&#13;
&#13;
And those peopleâ&#128;&#148;we now have 70 or 80 of them throughout the developed and&#13;
developing world. They're called private sector liaison officers. They work with the&#13;
Bank, but they're not Bank staff members. They have a title and an association&#13;
agreement with us, and that powerful network is run out of Paris, and is a fantastic way&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to communicate to businesses about investment opportunities in developing countries,&#13;
procurement opportunities with the Bank, opportunities with IFC, MIGA, and so forth.&#13;
So we created yet another global network out of Paris for this constituency.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, is there a group of business leaders or executives that come together&#13;
regularly to look at these issues, or do you deal strictly through this network of liaisons?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: This world-spanning network is one of the ways to get to them, but&#13;
Wolfensohn also had a group of 14, 15 CEOs that would get together every year, and I&#13;
always participated in these events with him which . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: European CEOs?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Worldwide, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: We would have [JÃ¼rgen] Schremp from DaimlerChrysler, [Louis V.]&#13;
Gerstner from IBM, the lady who runs Bain Company, people from Brazilian companies&#13;
like Aracruz, the head of HSBC, and so forth. And there were many other venues for&#13;
dealing with the private sector, including, you remember, my Business Partnership for&#13;
Development, which was this tri-sector partnership.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right, right, so that was still . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That was still running as well, right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: How did you do all that? There are only 24 hours in a day. I mean, this&#13;
strikes me as being . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, I was alwaysâ&#128;&#148;I was sort of an entrepreneur in the Bank. I&#13;
actuallyâ&#128;&#148;there was about 20 things I've started like that during my career, most of&#13;
which still exist today, some of which are gone, but I always loved to create new things.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: And let me ask about two aspects of what you were doing in Europe and the&#13;
Bank. First of all, what about the EDs [executive directors] from the European&#13;
countries? I mean, did you work with them, or did you find them resistant to this?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. They were actually very happy that we did this, and I became a&#13;
catalyst for closer cooperation between themâ&#128;&#148;in the early days of being in Paris, I&#13;
would fly over to Washington and I would invite them to lunch, and that's how they&#13;
would get together. They would not normally get together, and in the beginning I was&#13;
the glue between them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In those luncheons I would give them a state of Europe report of sorts or more precisely&#13;
a report on the state of the Bank in Europe, and that created the beginning of the glue&#13;
between themselves. Today, they're running their own meetings. In the beginning, it&#13;
was actually often me who was the get-together agent.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: So I mean they didn't . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And at some point, I think, after four or five years we started inviting the&#13;
European executive directors to come on study tours to Europe, and we would take them&#13;
to Brussels, to the European Commission, the various commissioners and departments.&#13;
And that they had never done, as well. That was a new thing, and after two or three&#13;
years they began doing it on their own.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, do you see within the Bank that theâ&#128;&#148;I mean, given the fact of the&#13;
share the Europeans have, are they cohesive enough to formâ&#128;&#148;I don't know what the&#13;
word isâ&#128;&#148;bloc, or at least on issues of . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No, because Europe is quite disorganized on the foreign affairs front.&#13;
Even on World Bank matters&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Although in the IMF, where they do have a natural bloc, which is the&#13;
euro . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . but even there, they're not acting completely as a bloc. But in the&#13;
World Bank, it's worse because they all have their pet theories on development. So the&#13;
Brits have one approach, the Dutch have their own approach, the French yet another, and&#13;
they don't like necessarily to be on the same page in terms of development approaches.&#13;
So they do have their idiosyncrasies.&#13;
&#13;
But these days, partly thanks to our efforts, they're now much more cohesive, and I hear&#13;
that sometimes they have meetings before Board meetings to see whether they will have&#13;
a European position on it. There are instances of joint statements by many European&#13;
EDs, especially under Paul Wolfowitzâ&#128;&#153;s tenure.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. What about your work and the work of the Regional vice president for&#13;
Europe and Central Asia? Did you work closely with Linn for a while, I guess, when&#13;
you were . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. We had very few links.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: We were in a very different business. We were looking for support,&#13;
support for campaigns, support for G-8 ideas, money for the Bank, in a very different&#13;
mode than those that were working on the Eastern European developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: As a matter of fact, now that many countries have joined the European&#13;
Union, I think the European vice-presidency should have taken over those countries in&#13;
terms of the daily work because there's not much anymore for the Bank to do in those&#13;
countries . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . other than treating them like what we call Part I countries.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, okay. Now, looking at this in retrospect, even though it's only a few&#13;
months, whatâ&#128;&#148;of all of the efforts in this vice presidency, what do you think worked the&#13;
best? What do you see as the most promising for the long term and, frankly, what didn't&#13;
work too well?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: What worked well was the enormous increase in the dealings with the&#13;
Commission and the European Investment Bank and the other European players. I don't&#13;
know what the multiple is, but it's like four or five times more links.&#13;
&#13;
And the way we would operate, we had lots of connections to the Regional vice&#13;
presidencies and the network vice presidents, and we would facilitate their discovering&#13;
the parts of the European Commission that were relevant to their work. So that was one&#13;
thing we did.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, we helped Wolfensohn become an agenda-setter early onâ&#128;&#148;disseminate his&#13;
Comprehensive Development Framework and his ideas about Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Papers by using all the development ministers of Europe as his support group&#13;
for this. That was a very big part of the show.&#13;
&#13;
And then we supported a lot of the work after the Monterrey Summit, to get Europe to&#13;
become a proponent of higher aid budgets, and all the harmonization efforts on the aid&#13;
front between the Rome--there was a Rome conference and the Paris conference. Those&#13;
were all the kinds of things we did.&#13;
&#13;
We facilitated European access and partnerships for other Bank vice presidencies. So&#13;
we were actually very close to the senior management team and the vice presidencies in&#13;
the Bank, and we got lots done for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                   February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Anything that didn't work well? I think--given that it was a small vice&#13;
presidency, I think we did very well. Not only did we do well in Europe, but as I told&#13;
you, we did many things globally out of Europe which would not, in my opinion, have&#13;
been feasible in Washington.&#13;
&#13;
There is no way you could have created the global Parliamentary Network of the World&#13;
Bank out of Washington. We would have been killed in endless meetings. We did&#13;
really creative stuff out of there that you could only do by being a little bit at a distance,&#13;
and at the same time with the lean and mean ways of a small unit.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Is that then a model to create some vice presidencies in other parts of the&#13;
world, perhaps, that are not in Washington or . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I actually think the Regional vice presidents should be in their Regions in&#13;
most cases.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: The network vice presidencies, however, should be central . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . with branches in the countries, but they should have a central&#13;
Washington-based location.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, in the midst of all of these other efforts, I guess it's at Davos in 2001&#13;
you gave a talk that ultimately you expanded into your book on high noon [High Noon:&#13;
Twenty Global Problems, Twenty Years to Solve Them].&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I had given that talk actually in one of the ABCDE conferences in&#13;
Europe, and I had written it in one week. I would often take a few days of leave to write&#13;
a speech. And these were not really World Bank ideas. They were my personal ideas on&#13;
what was wrong with the international system, why the big issues were not being solved,&#13;
and what to do.&#13;
&#13;
And the speech went well. Shortly thereafter, around end 2000, and typical of what we&#13;
were doing in Europe, in our high-level strategic dialogue mode, we had Schroeder, who&#13;
was by then chancellor, requesting a briefing from Wolfensohn and a few others of us on&#13;
development issues for four or five hours. (We did lots of these things in Europe.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                      February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So we set up this meeting in a restaurant near Hanover on a Sunday afternoon in January&#13;
2001 with Chancellor Schroeder, and there was Wolfensohn, Nick [Nicholas H.] Sternâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
who was the chief economistâ&#128;&#148;and myself, and Schroeder and two other people. And&#13;
Wolfensohn explained about development and poverty for three hours.&#13;
&#13;
And I had kept the last hour for my own ideas on global governance and how to&#13;
accelerate the solutions to pressing global problems, which took a little bit of courage to&#13;
do. And I did it, and I explained to Jim a little bit what it was about before, but he had&#13;
never seen the slides.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And he was amazed by it, Jim was, but Schroeder as well. And&#13;
Schroeder said after one hour of this stuffâ&#128;&#148;we were already at the fourth hour of our&#13;
meeting on a Sunday, and we said â&#128;&#156;Should we stop?â&#128;? Schroeder said, â&#128;&#156;No, this is&#13;
interesting, let's keep on going.â&#128;? So we did another hour on this theme.&#13;
&#13;
And in the evening, I was in the Adlon Hotel with Jim in Berlin, and we had dinner, and&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;What should I do with these ideas?â&#128;? And he said, â&#128;&#156;Well, this going far beyond&#13;
the Bank, so write them up on your own.â&#128;? So I decided to think about it, and by&#13;
happenstance I invited David Ignatius, who's one of . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, sure, the columnist, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . columnists, and he was then the editor of the [International] Herald&#13;
Tribune, for lunch, not because of this, but because I had read a novel of his which I had&#13;
liked which was called A Firing Offense. And we sat down and talked about his novel,&#13;
and he asked me about what I was doing, and I told him about my ideas. And he said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Do you have anything on this?â&#128;? I said, â&#128;&#156;I have a speech that I gave.â&#128;? â&#128;&#156;Well,â&#128;? he said,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;send it to me.â&#128;? So I sent it to him.&#13;
&#13;
And I was headed to Davos a few weeks later with Jim, and Ignatius went to Davos&#13;
independently for the Herald Tribune. And on the flight there he read my paper, and&#13;
when he arrived in Davosâ&#128;&#148;I had given no speech in Davos at all, I was just with Jim,&#13;
Jim had given speeches--Ignatius wrote an op ed for the Herald Tribune, for the&#13;
Washington Post, saying nothingâ&#128;&#153;s going on in Davos, but there is this one guy who has&#13;
this idea, talking about me and my ideas. And so people always thought I had given a&#13;
big speech in Davos, but I never did. He just had entitled his column as having been&#13;
written in Davos.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I see.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And I got a lot of mail after that op ed, and so I went to see Ignatius again&#13;
and said, â&#128;&#156;What should I do? He said, â&#128;&#156;There's an agent I knowâ&#128;?â&#128;&#148;he gave me the name&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of a book agent in Washingtonâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;go and have a look and see what he says.â&#128;? So I went&#13;
to see that agent.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: At Basic Books they . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. Basic Books was the publisher . ..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: [Inaudible] and the agent said I should do a book proposal, which I did. I&#13;
produced a sort of five-, six-page book proposal, gave it to him and sort of forgot about&#13;
it. That would have been April-May 2001. And being in Corsica again in the summer&#13;
[inaudible], when I arrived mid-July, there was a phone call from that agent, whom I&#13;
only had seen one hour in my life. I've never seen him again. And he said, â&#128;&#156;Good news,&#13;
bad news. The good news is we've sold the book. The bad news is you have to deliver&#13;
the first manuscript in October,â&#128;? and this was July.&#13;
&#13;
So I sat down and wrote and wrote and wrote. I had to clear the idea of the book with&#13;
the managing director because this was a personal book and I could have damaged the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: But the managing director, Sven Sandstrom, and the vice president for&#13;
External Affairs [and UN Affairs], Mats Karlsson, thought it was actually going to be&#13;
good for the Bank to do the book. So they . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: [Inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, they approved the book outline and Mats even the final text. And so&#13;
I wrote the book, and it was published less than a year later in June of 2002.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Now, I want to talk a little bit about some of the ideas in the book, but how&#13;
has the book been received?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Surprisingly well. It's in its fourth year and it's still selling quite well. It&#13;
has sold more than 50,000 copies across the world and it's in 10 languages. And it's the&#13;
only book of its kind that not only reviews all the big global issues and why they're not&#13;
being solved, but also gives some sort of ideas on what we could do to get out of the&#13;
predicament we're in.&#13;
&#13;
So because it's the only book of its kind that is not just gloom and doom but has some&#13;
ideas, it's still sort of carrying weightâ&#128;&#148;I mean, just in the last two days and next days,&#13;
for example, I will have given the speech eight times.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Oh, okay. I won't ask you to repeat what you've said, but what I find&#13;
interesting about all of this is that I'm curious about how you came up to what I would&#13;
call a holistic view about problem-solving. I mean, had you read things?&#13;
&#13;
I mean, I know all of your experience, and especially your cross-European experience,&#13;
but so few peopleâ&#128;&#148;I read a lot of material on development. So few people try to take a&#13;
large view.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: You know, what prompted this holistic view?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes. I think what prompted it was, first of all, being from the World&#13;
Bank. And you saw my career.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I was jumping from industry and petrochemicals, to asset liability&#13;
management, to running the trading room, to being in the private sector development&#13;
area, to worrying about urban projects, to working in external affairs. So I was always a&#13;
broad type. And I'm a very curious and studious type. I read a lot and I'm curious. So I&#13;
know about lots of things, more so, I think, than most people in the Bank, who tend to be&#13;
relatively narrowly specialized. So I was always a big-picture-type guy.&#13;
&#13;
Also the job in Europe helped because in Europe I was representing the whole Bank, and&#13;
I had to be knowledgeable about all the things the Bank did, from environment, to&#13;
agriculture, to AIDS issues, to country issues, and so forth. It was one of the few jobsâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
being vice president of Europe, it was one of the few jobs in the Bank, next to the&#13;
president's job, where you have to know everything. There are very few jobs like this in&#13;
the Bank. Managing directors don't know that much beyond the direct scope of their&#13;
work, but the vice president for Europe, the External Affairs vice president and the&#13;
president are the three that have to know about everything. So that was another&#13;
explanation for my having a broad sweep.&#13;
&#13;
And then I have the habit of clipping newspapers, so I had tons of articles on global&#13;
warming, on trade, on water, on poverty, on any topic that I cover in the book. I had a&#13;
hoard of articles, and I still have at home bags and bags full of these things. And I was&#13;
able to essentially describe 20 global issues as disparate as, as different as . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . global warming, to drug-trading, to . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Taxation.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . taxation, to intellectual property rights, to AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis,&#13;
in one style, in one way of writing. And I think that is coming from having been at the&#13;
World Bank for so many years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: My own take, not thatâ&#128;&#148;this is not about me, but what struck me about this&#13;
was to look at these issues in what you call global issues networks, I mean the whole&#13;
idea that these issues are, in fact, a network problem rather than just a discreet, you&#13;
know, separate kind of problem that'sâ&#128;&#148;and that they're also global, that the problems, in&#13;
fact, are so interrelated.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Yes, that's the thing. The problems are inherently global. They're cross-&#13;
border issues by definition and they're long-term issues. And the problem we're facing&#13;
on this planet is that we've carved it up into 190 nation-states, all of which are not&#13;
global, but they're territorial in their perspectives, and their politicians run for election&#13;
every four years. So there's a clash between the nation-state system and the nature of&#13;
these cross-border, long-term issues like global warming.&#13;
&#13;
And so my diagnosisâ&#128;&#148;and I haven't changed my mind on thisâ&#128;&#148;is there's not a chance in&#13;
hell that 190 countries will get together at the UN level and solve these problems. Just&#13;
think of global warming. And they're actually not doing this at all, and so you must find&#13;
another way to prompt a solution toward this problem.&#13;
&#13;
And the only other way I know of is to create networks of experts that delve very deeply&#13;
into each of these issues and essentially delineate the solutions which the world would&#13;
adopt if it was under single management. What would we now be doing to stabilize the&#13;
concentration of carbon dioxide? What would we now be going to prevent the collapse&#13;
of fisheries? And based on these solutions, then spell out the norms that fit with these&#13;
solutions and the norms that would coax the nation-states into the direction of the&#13;
solutions. And finally, rate the countries against the norms to essentially create&#13;
reputation effects, embarrassment effects, and essentially help the voters in the world&#13;
figure out where their government stands against these issues; in other terms, create&#13;
some sort of pressure on the nation-states and their politicians to be more planetary-&#13;
minded and more long-term-oriented than they naturally are by using experts. And to&#13;
get experts to work together on issues, you use networks.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I looked up some of the reviews of the book, just to get some of the largerâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
you know, how people have reacted to it. And the one critiqueâ&#128;&#148;and I'm just curious&#13;
about your response to this critiqueâ&#128;&#148;is thatâ&#128;&#148;and I'm not saying this as, you know, a&#13;
parochial American, but the one critique was that you left outâ&#128;&#148;that you underestimated&#13;
the power of not all states, but critical states like, you know, a country like the United&#13;
States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The current administration in the United States ignores a lot of these things and [held?]&#13;
views of this are beyond embarrassment, it seems to me, about a lot of these things. So&#13;
what do you do in the face of something like that?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Well, one of the examples that has inspired my ideas of norm-setting and&#13;
rating of countries is actually what happened in the money laundering area four years&#13;
ago, where the G-8 asked something called the Financial Action Task Force to spell out&#13;
40 criteria on what constitutes the toleration of money laundering by countries.&#13;
&#13;
Based on these 40 criteria, 15 countries were named on the blacklist. Russia was on it,&#13;
Israel was on it. And a year later, half the countries on that list had passed legislation&#13;
and regulations to get off this highly embarrassing list. And the U.S.â&#128;&#148;very few people&#13;
know thisâ&#128;&#148;the U.S. violated 28 of the 40 criteria, and the U.S. was so embarrassed of&#13;
even risking to be on the blacklist on money laundering that they immediately did what&#13;
they had to do to not get on the list. So even the U.S. can be shamed and embarrassed.&#13;
&#13;
And these global issues networks, which would be very solemn, very Nobel-Prizing-&#13;
winning in their ambience and their loftinessâ&#128;&#148;if they produced their 20 ratings on 20&#13;
norm settings, because there are 20 issues, on all the countries in the world and if the&#13;
U.S. didn't stack up well and the U.S. fell in the rogue state category, as it wereâ&#128;&#148;I'm not&#13;
saying it would, itâ&#128;&#153;s just an illustration . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . I think this would embarrass the hell out of the U.S. public. The voters&#13;
would act up in the next elections, and other countries would begin to exercise at least&#13;
reputational embarrassment and maybe even sanction effects on the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
So I think even a very powerful country, when it's exposed as a rogue state, would pay&#13;
attention to this. At any rate, if these reputation effects and voter information effects are&#13;
not going to do the job, I don't know what else the solution is to the predicament we're in&#13;
..&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . because, as I said earlier, the nation-states themselves will not come up&#13;
with the solutions at the global level.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So we need some form of pressure on them, and I think reputation&#13;
pressure actually is one of the few things that work in this difficult time.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The other thing you suggested in some of your other writingsâ&#128;&#148;you talk about leadership&#13;
and the less than likelyâ&#128;&#148;that we're going to find a political leader with the kind of vision&#13;
and also with theâ&#128;&#148;given the problems that leaders in all the major countries faceâ&#128;&#148;with&#13;
the sort of political capital to take on these larger global issues. I mean, where do you&#13;
see some leadership coming in that area?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I thinkâ&#128;&#148;I don't think you can expect there to come up a new generation&#13;
of [Winston] Churchills and [Franklin D.] Roosevelts.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Or Jean Monnet.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Or Jean Monnet.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And it will be futile to wait for that as the solution to our woes.&#13;
Leadership won't come spontaneously. Especially not in this age.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: As a matter of fact, as the world becomes more chaotic, we may have&#13;
downgrades in leadership qualities, and I think that's what we're seeing now.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I agree with that.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So for me, the leadership cannot come from the electoral systems that&#13;
bring up politicians. The leadership has to come from experts, the world's best experts&#13;
on fisheries depletion, on global warming, on drug-trading, and so forth. We must let&#13;
the experts speak by organizing expert groups into serious, solemn, well-managed&#13;
networks that create the leadership that is not coming from the political class.&#13;
&#13;
If there is one class that is lagging in global problem-solving, it's not the CEOs, it's not&#13;
the leaders of the NGOs . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . it's not the leaders of the multilateral institutions. It's the political&#13;
personnel of the nation states that's the laggard. With their four-year electoral cycles,&#13;
politicians arenâ&#128;&#153;t really capable of handling the issues.&#13;
&#13;
So, as I often say, when you fly through a storm, would you rather have the pilots drive&#13;
the airplane or a committee of the passengers? For me, the experts are the pilots, and it's&#13;
time we bring in the experts to fly the plane. The committee of the passengers, being the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                      February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
committee of 190 nation-states getting together in the UNâ&#128;&#148;that's not going to produce a&#13;
solution. And our planet is flying through a storm for sure.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So it's high time that we moved to the leadership of experts. Whether&#13;
you like experts or not, when the going gets tough, that's where you have to go.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes. You said you've had very good sales with this and all. You've&#13;
retired from the Bank, in May of 2005.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes. Have you tried to institutionalize some of these ideas?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I'm still giving lots of speeches on the High Noon book and on the High&#13;
Noon speech, and I'm beginning toâ&#128;&#148;I have a sort of business plan, which I already had a&#13;
year ago for setting up a foundation, the job of which would be to lobby many global&#13;
leaders, business leaders, religious leaders, parliamentarians, any sort of leaders in the&#13;
world, toward putting pressure on heads of states to sit down and discuss the question of&#13;
the methodology of global problem-solving, and maybe authorize two or three&#13;
experiments along the lines of what I'm suggesting.&#13;
&#13;
So for me, the next step is to create a foundation to lobby as many leaders as we can in&#13;
the world to get to that point where the leaders, the heads of state-type leaders, will get&#13;
together on this massive issue of the methodology. So I have documents to do the&#13;
fundraising, but I'm just starting on that approach.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Do you want to take a break?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. It's . . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: I have some final questions I want to ask you, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: No. Let's keep on going because I need to [inaudible].&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. Well, let me just check how we're doing with our tape. I might have&#13;
to stop and change tapes. I'll let you know. The little buzzers go off.&#13;
&#13;
Why did you decide to retire when you decided to retire?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: I decided to retire for various reasons. One is I rediscovered Europe&#13;
being the only vice president outside Washington and the idea of returning to D.C. felt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
like a regression. And yetâ&#128;&#148;I had to come back. I could no longer stay. I had been in&#13;
my job for more than seven years, which was unheard of.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And each time they tried to yank me backâ&#128;&#148;they wanted me to be the&#13;
External Affairs vice president, for exampleâ&#128;&#148;I would turn them down. And at some&#13;
point, Shengman Zhang said, â&#128;&#156;No, no, it's over, you have to come back.â&#128;? So I was faced&#13;
with the idea of coming back.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, I would have come back and would have ended up in the new presidential&#13;
regime of Paul Wolfowitz, and then I thought to myself, â&#128;&#156;God, this will be my sixth&#13;
president. Do I still have the energy to help regroup the new president who comes in&#13;
and doesn't know much about development?â&#128;? And that didn't appeal to me too much.&#13;
&#13;
And the third reason was that I felt that I could not go all out on these ideas of the High&#13;
Noon book while being vice president of the Bank. Actually, it's amazing I could do as&#13;
much as I did under Jim Wolfensohn, who was protecting me, I guess. And the Bank, in&#13;
general, was very protective, but there's a limit to how much you can do when you're a&#13;
staff member of the Bank and you have to criticize the G-7 methodology, say.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So it was time to swing to a more activist mode on these ideas and maybe&#13;
write another book. Writing this book while being at the Bank, that was a tough thing to&#13;
do in the first place.. .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . because I was a very busy vice president.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And so the time had come to move on. Also, I had been in the Bank 30&#13;
years, with the exception of the Wall Street years.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: So it was actually 27. And a lot of my friends were beginning to leave&#13;
the Bank, and it was also a good time to go and start another career around particularly&#13;
the ideas of the book.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. How much time do you have?&#13;

&#13;
RISCHARD: On the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s future, I think the Bank is more at a crossroads than it was&#13;
ten years ago when we made these big changes we discussed, and I really think the Bank&#13;
has two problems. It has a business model problem and it has a structural problem.&#13;
&#13;
And the business model problem is that there are actually three business lines to look at.&#13;
The first business line is what I call the mission-driven business of the Bank. This is&#13;
where the Bank goes into a country with a Country Assistance Strategy and a Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategy Paper and it tries to help the government fight poverty and do the&#13;
right thing.&#13;
&#13;
That mission-driven business today is 90 percent of the Bank, and that business line, I&#13;
think, will dwindle down year after year after year, because we're going to lose the&#13;
investment-grade borrowersâ&#128;&#148;China, India, and others, Brazil and Mexicoâ&#128;&#148;who will no&#13;
longer needâ&#128;&#148;they don't need the World Bank money anymore.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: And at the other extreme, the very low-creditworthiness borrowers are&#13;
getting grants and debt relief. So the Bank's credit culture has been undermined. So you&#13;
lose the top clients and the bottom clients, and you only have this strip in the middle.&#13;
And I see that Bank as declining from money-wise and volume, but also in quality.&#13;
&#13;
The second business line would be a demand-driven, sophisticated best practices&#13;
business. In that part of the Bank, the client there is not a government, like in the first&#13;
business line. The client is the government official who needs quickly some advice on&#13;
sectoral management; what are the best pension reform methods and how did it work in&#13;
Mexico as compared to Chile; quick advice on the best road surfacing methods in certain&#13;
climate conditions, and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
And, there, whereas in the first business line, the mission-driven business, the&#13;
competitors and would-be partners are the bilateral agencies and the other multilaterals,&#13;
in this business of sophisticated best practices the partner or competitor is the OECD.&#13;
And the Bank used to be in my days in the central vice presidency very good at this&#13;
stuff. I had superb insurance reform experts, mortgage bank experts, experts in&#13;
bankruptcy laws, and you name it. And that part of the Bank today has shrunk to 5&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                    February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The third part of the business model is what I call global issues-driven business, issues&#13;
like climate change, issues like avian flu, and so forth, where the client is not the&#13;
developing country government or even official, like in the first two business lines, but&#13;
where the client is the international community itself. And that business line is only 5&#13;
percent today.&#13;
&#13;
So the Bank is 90-5-5 in terms of these three business lines. And that Bank, I think, will&#13;
decline. The Bank--if the Bank wants to survive to 2015 and be a strong and acclaimed&#13;
Bank by then, it needs, in my opinion, to be 50 percent mission-driven, 30 percent&#13;
sophisticated best practice-driven, 20 percent, at least, global issues-driven.&#13;
&#13;
For me, that's the Bank of the future. That's the Bank that will be there 15, 20 years&#13;
from now. The status quo Bank will just dwindle down. In other terms, the Bank needs&#13;
to ignite the engines of the second and the third business lines big time.&#13;
&#13;
The second and third business lines are much less Regional vice president-centric than&#13;
network vice president-centric. The global issues business is something that is very&#13;
centered on network vice presidencies; the sophisticated demand-driven best practices,&#13;
half and half. It's only the first business line that is Regional vice president-centric.&#13;
&#13;
So I think the Bank has to go into that three-business-line model, rather than hang on&#13;
exclusively on this mono-line business of poverty reduction in a mission-driven mode.&#13;
And to get there, there are problems of structure.&#13;
&#13;
The first problem of structure we already talked about; it's this hybrid design, which has&#13;
caused the quality of the Bank staff to go down. And the Bank has essentially lost its&#13;
franchise it had in being the sophisticated provider of detailed development strategies&#13;
and best practices.&#13;
&#13;
And so we must change back to the design I said earlier I was defending, where the&#13;
technical staff reports to the network vice presidencies in the first place, and the network&#13;
vice presidencies supply these people back to the Regional vice presidents as you&#13;
provide consultants. And the network vice-presidencies are then judged by the Regional&#13;
vice presidents on their deliveries of high-quality staff and products.&#13;
&#13;
If the Bank doesn't swing over to that structure, which is the structure we should have&#13;
adopted in '96, the Bank will be going down. We can see that the Bank of today has lost&#13;
its technical aura in many, many areas I could mention, and it no longer has this&#13;
reputation that it has that cadre of gurus on any topic in the world you wanted to ask&#13;
something about.&#13;
&#13;
The second structural problem is that over the Wolfensohn years, when you analyze the&#13;
composition of the senior management team, not all is well. In the old days, before&#13;
Wolfensohn came in, the proportion of senior managers that were what I call business&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
leader types, visionary business leaders for Africa, for environment, for each topicâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
proportion of these business leader types has gone down over time very dramatically.&#13;
&#13;
And the proportion of what I call process manager types has gone up. Of course, these&#13;
manager types are those that are good at World Bank procedures and in running the&#13;
trains in the station, but they're not passionate and high caliber leaders of a particular&#13;
business or a particular region. And that, for me, has been one of the reasons of the&#13;
decline of the Bank. Wolfensohn, in a way, didn't like to have too many visionary&#13;
business leader types around. So he put in many process managers, and that has been&#13;
the bane of the Bank, alongside with this faulty structure.&#13;
&#13;
And the third thing that needs structural change in the Bank has to do with the fact that&#13;
the Bank has over the last ten years been really invaded by an overgrowth of internal&#13;
procedures, safeguards, guidelines, vetting systems, internal meetings, to the point where&#13;
the staff spends more than 70 percent of their time talking to themselves in terms of&#13;
internal procedures.&#13;
&#13;
The Board runs 400 meetings a year. The introversion and overgrowth are just&#13;
tremendous, and that has to be tackled, absolutely. And the Bank needs to go through&#13;
what I call a detox exercise, and about two-thirds of the internal processes have to be&#13;
canned because a lot of them do not add any value to the clients of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
So for me, the Bank has to have a new business model, the 50-30-20 model, not the 90-&#13;
5-5 model, and it needs to make these three structural changes in short order before it's&#13;
too late to recapture its role not just as a premier development institution, but in the&#13;
future as the main docking station for many of these global issues networks that I'm&#13;
talking about in my book, without which we will not be able to solve the big issues of&#13;
the world.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Okay. I often end with a question about the presidents of the Bank that&#13;
you've known, and you've spoken rather fulsomely about Preston and you've had a lot to&#13;
say about Wolfensohn. Is there anything you want to add? I mean, where do you think&#13;
Wolfensohn will stack up as a World Bank president?&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: Wolfensohn was a fantastic president in terms of rebuilding of the image&#13;
of the Bank and on the external side of the Bank. I mean, I've been with him trooping&#13;
throughout Europe and all over the world many, many times and he was just a master at&#13;
this. He knew every leader in the world. He had an intuitive way of explaining the&#13;
Bank and development that was fabulous. He was an absolute star on that front.&#13;
&#13;
And the Bank of 1994 was very depressed, very criticized. He rebuilt its image and&#13;
reputation in a very masterful way. He connected the Bank to many other constituencies&#13;
like religions, parliamentarians, the business world. He has been on that score a great&#13;
president.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean-Francois Rischard&#13;
                                     February 27 and 28, 2006&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Where he has been weakerâ&#128;&#148;and you could see it from my remarks . .&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
RISCHARD: . . was in the internal management aspects. First of all, he never&#13;
understood very well the structural problems that were engineered under his beat. He&#13;
presided over the over-population of process managers, as compared to business leader&#13;
types, and he chased some of the visionary business leaders away. And he didn't do&#13;
much about preventing this overgrowth of internal processes that has marked the last ten&#13;
years. But he was not the only culprit. The Board was quite bad at this, as wellâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
Board, influenced by the NGO world.&#13;
&#13;
So I think he will still be one of the greatest presidents, probably, with or after&#13;
McNamara, or maybe even before McNamara in terms of ranking. But he had his weak&#13;
points, as well, and the weak points are those that have caused the Bank to be in bad&#13;
shape in terms of the quality of its staff and its products.&#13;
&#13;
And so he has the left the Bank with a much better reputation than in '94, but in a way a&#13;
Bank that has singular weaknesses as it goes into the next century.&#13;
&#13;
BECKER: Right. Well, thank you very much.&#13;
