RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
SOCIAL PROTECTION IMPLEMENTATION LOAN&#13;
I.    BACKGROUND&#13;
A.    COUNTRY AND SECTOR CONTEXT&#13;
1.           Russia's major economic transformation of the past years has had severe social costs.&#13;
Since 1992, real money incomes and output have fallen by over 40%, and a gradual widening in income&#13;
distribution among population groups and between regions has occurred. High average monthly rates of&#13;
inflation have adversely affected the population, especially those on fixed incomes. Real earnings have&#13;
fallen, and in 1996 real wages averaged less than half their level in 1991. Increasing numbers of people&#13;
have been subject to layoffs and hours adjustment in the face of overstaffing and falling labor demand.&#13;
Unemployment, including hidden unemployment and underemployment, is now estimated to be close to&#13;
15 percent. Wage and pension arrears have accumulated rapidly: in 1996 only about 40% of the work&#13;
force was paid fully and on time. The dramatic changes in income distribution widened gaps between&#13;
various groups of the population as well as between regions.&#13;
2.           The poor in Russia are primarily families with several children, and those with an&#13;
unemployed household member. This pattern has in fact become more pronounced over time, as poverty&#13;
rates among these groups have risen faster than those for the general population. By the end of 1995,&#13;
households with children under 18 years old were those with poverty rates almost 50% higher than the&#13;
general population, and those with even one unemployed member had poverty headcounts more than 15&#13;
points above the national average. In contrast, households with pensioners have not been found to have&#13;
high poverty rates on average, a finding which is consistent with poverty assessments throughout the&#13;
FSU. The reasons for this include the better retention of the real value of pensions relative to wages, the&#13;
incidence of pensioners who both work and receive full pensions, and the larger stock of assets owned by&#13;
pensioners at the start of the transition. However, there are sub-groups of pensioners who are very poor,&#13;
particularly those living alone, who are predominantly women.&#13;
3.           Pensions, unemployment benefits, child allowances and social assistance programs and&#13;
short-term sickness and maternity benefits absorbed some 8% of GDP in 1995. In addition, enterprises&#13;
and local authorities (oblast level) provide an array of social benefits, ranging from subsidized housing&#13;
and utilities to cheap food and vacations. While income from formal and informal sector activities is the&#13;
primary form of support for the majority of the population, the formal social safety net also plays an&#13;
important role for many households. On average, public transfers accounted for 16.7% of household&#13;
income at the start of 1996. Private transfers have always been an important component of the safety net&#13;
in Russia, and while there is little accurate information on them, they appear to continue to be so.&#13;
Finally, the NGO sector is emerging as an important complement to the overall safety net.&#13;
4.           Social insurance and unemployment assistance are financed through extra-budgetary&#13;
funds (EBFs), supported by payroll taxes currently totaling 34.8% of the wage bill. Child allowances are&#13;
a universal benefit financed from local revenues and supplemented with federal transfers. Such transfers&#13;
are in the form of unconditional block grants to oblasts for a range of federal government obligations, of&#13;
which child allowances are a designated priority. Social assistance is funded entirely from local&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
5.           This system has not been able to cope well with the demands placed by the transition:&#13;
*      It is a costly system: average replacement rates are high (although benefit amounts are&#13;
low) and coverage is extensive and untargeted;&#13;
*     The current payment crisis (pension and wage arrears) exacerbates the situation: the&#13;
payroll tax base is eroding, as production shifts towards informal or unreported&#13;
activities, and there are growing arrears in federal obligations;&#13;
*     Decentralization has not worked well: local resources have been insufficient to provide&#13;
poverty relief, especially in poorer regions with weak local tax bases; existing federal&#13;
equalization mechanisms lack transparent rules that would allow better targeting of&#13;
poorer regions; and limited federal resources have kept transfers small;&#13;
*     There is no basic poverty benefit; local and regional social assistance programs attempt&#13;
to fill this role, but vary widely in the poverty focus of their interventions and are&#13;
underfunded; and&#13;
*     A large number of poor households do not receive benefits, with one out of five poor&#13;
households not receiving any public transfers. Benefits are insufficient to lift poor&#13;
families over the poverty threshold: unemployment benefits average about 15% of the&#13;
subsistence minimum; child allowances between 13% and 19% of the subsistence&#13;
minimum for children; the pension floor is at 75% of the elderly subsistence level; and&#13;
social assistance is widely regarded as inadequate in scope and levels to have a&#13;
significant impact on poverty.&#13;
6.           In sum, the current system, if maintained in its present form, will not be able to provide&#13;
adequate social protection. It is unable to fulfill either a poverty relief or an income replacement&#13;
function adequately, nor can the programs be set at or above subsistence without upsetting fiscal balance&#13;
-- it would require an estimated additional 4% of GDP (start 1996) to raise all poor households to&#13;
subsistence levels. Efforts to reduce poverty and strengthen social protection will require a combination&#13;
of economic growth and reforms in transfer programs. An appropriate safety net strategy requires: (i)&#13;
higher minimum benefits and better targeting of vulnerable groups; (ii) adjusting existing programs to&#13;
improve efficiency; and (iii) initiating systemic reforms to create an affordable system of poverty relief&#13;
and income maintenance.&#13;
B.    GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY&#13;
7.            Since the elections in 1996, and especially since the formation of the new government in&#13;
April 1997, the Government has become concerned about social protection issues. This reflects the high&#13;
political and social costs of arrears in social payments, especially pensions, brought on by fiscal&#13;
pressures, as well as a growing realization that existing income transfer programs, even if fully funded,&#13;
do not reach important vulnerable groups. The Government's strategy is articulated in the Program of&#13;
Social Reforms 1996-2000, approved by the Govermment in February 1997, and in President Yeltsin's&#13;
address to the Federal Assembly in March 1997.&#13;
8.           New appointments have been made at high levels of the Government of individuals with&#13;
credible track records of social reform in the regions, a favorable popular image, and proven capacity to&#13;
muster support for difficult decisions. In addition, several other appointments have been made to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
strengthen the cadre of reformers working on social sector issues. These changes have brought new&#13;
momentum and energy to the reform program in the social sectors.&#13;
9.           The Government's social protection strategy focuses on:&#13;
*     Creating an efficient pension system, in line with modern western practice that would be&#13;
financially viable and provide adequate social protection to the poorest groups;&#13;
*     Providing economically efficient employment opportunities, while improving labor force&#13;
productivity and labor market flexibility;&#13;
*     Reallocating public (federal and sub-federal) financial resources devoted to social&#13;
protection so as to increasingly target income support to needy households; and&#13;
*     Clearly delineating of responsibility for social issues at the federal, regional and local&#13;
levels.&#13;
10.          The first step in this strategy entails the establishment of a new legal framework for&#13;
social protection, and the next few months will see an intensification in the introduction of such new&#13;
legislation. In parallel, the Government will be introducing changes through the 1998 budget process,&#13;
and taking steps to reform the institutions involved at the federal level.&#13;
11.          Over the past few months, the Government has launched a number of new initiatives&#13;
which, supported by the SPAL and this project, will amount to a major and far-reaching reform of the&#13;
whole social protection system. These reforms focus on improving the poverty impact and targeting of&#13;
existing transfer programs, and at institutional reforms aimed at making such programs sustainable and&#13;
efficient. In addition, the Government has taken important steps which have improved the environment&#13;
for social policy reform, notably:&#13;
*     the introduction of measures to strengthen tax collection, including better reporting&#13;
obligations for banks and enterprises;&#13;
*     public initiatives to enforce tax payment compliance of large companies, especially the&#13;
so-called natural monopolies;&#13;
*     housing and utilities reform, with a particular focus on protecting poor households as&#13;
subsidies are reduced; and&#13;
*     improvements in the system of inter-budgetary transfers, which are especially important&#13;
for social programs and child allowances.&#13;
C.    THE SOCIAL PROTECTION ADJUSTMENT LOAN&#13;
12.          The Social Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL) in the amount of US$800 million was&#13;
approved by the Board on June 25, 1997 and will be disbursed in three tranches. The first tranche of&#13;
US$300 million was released upon loan effectiveness on June 26, 1997. The SPAL supports the&#13;
Government Social Protection Reform Program in order to gradually develop an effective system of&#13;
income support and poverty relief to meet the needs of a market economy. It also supports efforts to&#13;
reduce the adverse effects of transition on the poor and vulnerable population groups. The key areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
covered by the SPAL are social insurance (including pensions and short-term insurance for sickness and&#13;
maternity), social assistance, social protection, child allowances, and unemployment assistance. The&#13;
SPAL pursues poverty alleviation measures by raising and protecting minimum benefits, and through&#13;
better targeting. It will help establish a viable social safety net by introducing structural reforms in&#13;
pensions and welfare programs. In order to help safeguard the Government's macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization targets, the SPAL will emphasize efficiency improvements in the safety net programs and&#13;
the reallocation of resources within existing programs towards needy groups, without increasing public&#13;
expenditures, as severe fiscal constraints prevent the Government from undertaking reallocations from&#13;
other sectors in the short term. Preparation of the SPAL was a collaborative effort between the Russian&#13;
authorities and the Bank. The process was led by an Interministerial Steering Committee headed by the&#13;
Minister of Economy, and involved key ministries and agencies in the relevant social areas. The SPAL&#13;
benefited from extensive sector work and discussions with policymakers and independent Russian&#13;
experts.' The proposed reforms will represent major changes in the system of social protection and&#13;
income transfers, and are expected to have a significant impact on alleviating poverty and stabilizing&#13;
incomes among vulnerable groups, and prepare for more targeted safety net interventions in the future2.&#13;
Sector work includes Russia: Social Protection During Transition and Beyond (World Bank, 1994) and&#13;
Poverty in Russia: An Assessment (World Bank, 1995).&#13;

II.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
13.          As a companion project to the Social Protection Adjustment Loan, the objectives of the&#13;
SPIL are to support implementation of the social reforms under the SPAL to gradually develop an&#13;
effective system of income support and poverty relief to meet the needs of a market economy. The key&#13;
areas covered by the SPAL are social insurance (including pensions and short-termn insurance for&#13;
sickness and maternity), social assistance, social protection, child allowances, and unemployment&#13;
assistance. In addition, the SPIL would support a broader program for social protection including setting&#13;
up monitoring systems, data analysis, and reviews of on-going programs for unemployment and social&#13;
protection.&#13;
B.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
14.          The project would build upon ongoing efforts which provide support for the&#13;
implementation of the Government's Program of Social Reform 1996-2000. Early preparation work on&#13;
the project started under PHRD grant financing: US$0.5 million was reallocated from the Portfolio&#13;
Development Loan (Loan 3844-RU), and an advance from PPF No. P322-0-RU for US$2.0 million&#13;
approved on June 18, 1997. Financing of the activities under the SPIL is being complemented by&#13;
US$1.5 million for the procurement of computers for the Social Assistance Pilots from the Bank-&#13;
financed Employment Services and Social Protection Project (Loan 3532-RU). The Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (Schedule D) provides information on the timing of specific activities, their output&#13;
and government agency responsible for their execution. The project consists of five main components:&#13;
15.          The Pension Reform Component (US$8.49 million total base costs) will include&#13;
technical assistance and training for: (i) assisting the Pension Fund in managing individual workers'&#13;
accounts and in establishing a regulatory framework for governing such accounts; (ii) auditing the&#13;
Pension Fund (PF); (iii) implementing an action plan for improving collection of pension contributions;&#13;
(iv) preparing a detailed concept paper and legislation on systemic pension reform involving introduction&#13;
of a three-tier pension system; (v) designing and implementing a public information and communications&#13;
campaign; (vi) implementing systemic pension reform; and (vii) organizing actuarial activities.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to develop and model various options for pension reform. The&#13;
technical assistance will concentrate on modeling the "state" pension system, which will have a publicly&#13;
financed component (some combination of pay-as-you-go labor pensions and citizens' pensions) and&#13;
where mandatory individual accounts are capitalized. The major options to be developed will be&#13;
illustrative of various approaches to reform and will focus on transition scenarios. The objective of&#13;
supporting the auditing of the Pension Fund is to assess the accounting practices and financial status of&#13;
the Fund. The audit of the PF is a condition of third tranche release (estimated to be in June 1998) under&#13;
the SPAL. The objective of implementing the action plan on improving PF collections is to help the PF&#13;
cope with its current crisis and fiscal insolvency and to ensure that pension contributions are collected&#13;
effectively. These efforts will be complemented by (i) drafting and adopting a concept paper and&#13;
legislation on systemic pension reform involving introduction of a three tier pension system to develop a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
longer term strategy for pension reform, (ii) developing a strategy for a public information and education&#13;
program on the reformn to inform the population as a whole about the changes in the structure of the&#13;
pension system and to communicate the various trade-offs associated with reform as well as benefits; and&#13;
(iii) developing public and private mechanisms that provide affordable income support, which will likely&#13;
include introducing a new, multi-tier system to either run in parallel to the old system or to eventually&#13;
replace the pay-as-you go system.&#13;
16.          The Social Assistance Component (US$1.21 million total base costs) will provide&#13;
technical assistance and training to assist the Government in: (i) designing and implementing programs&#13;
in the Komi Republic, and in the Volgograd and Voronezh oblasts, to pilot different methods of means-&#13;
testing social assistance benefits, including reviewing the legal framework of allowances at&#13;
regional/local level; (ii) conducting national evaluation and dissemination programs of the results of the&#13;
pilot programs; (iii) reviewing social benefits, subsidies, compensation and payments, and (iv) reviewing&#13;
the system of local delivery of social services. More specifically, implementation of programs to pilot&#13;
various means-testing methods will enable the three pilot regions to implement the SPAL conditionality&#13;
on the introduction of a temporary extreme poverty scheme. The component will provide technical&#13;
assistance and finance computerization of local social assistance offices for benefits' payment. Funding&#13;
for the computerization aspect is being provided by the Bank-financed Employment Services and Social&#13;
Protection Project which has been restructured. In addition, the component will support analysis to&#13;
determine cost-effective methods of income-testing. Funds will also be used to disseminate the findings&#13;
of the national evaluation for the social assistance pilots.&#13;
17.          The Social Protection Component (US$5.21 million total base costs) will support the&#13;
Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD), and Goskomstat with technical assistance, training&#13;
and equipment to: (i) put in place a monitoring system of all regional and national social transfers; (ii)&#13;
analyze data and monitor poverty and nutrition levels; (iii) conduct a national survey of household&#13;
welfare and program participation; and (iv) review governmental and non-governmental programs&#13;
directed at child protection, handicapped and homeless. More specifically, the component will support&#13;
the establishment of a regular reporting system of all the financial flows at the national and regional&#13;
levels in order for MLSD to better track the funds sent to the regions and the programs on which they are&#13;
being spent. Further, it will support monitoring and analysis of data in the area of poverty by&#13;
conducting three rounds of household surveys similar to those conducted to measure household welfare&#13;
and program participation and to complement the national household expenditure survey already in&#13;
place. The survey will provide information on local variation in the availability of social series and&#13;
social assistance, and review and evaluate currently existing programs directed at protection of the most&#13;
vulnerable groups of the population.&#13;
18.          The Child Allowances Component (US$10.97 million total base costs) will provide&#13;
technical assistance, training, and equipment to support (i) design and implementation of programs to&#13;
pilot the transfer of payment of child allowances from enterprises to local social assistance offices; and&#13;
(ii) national dissemination of results from pilot programs. The component will support and enable the&#13;
transfer of payment of child allowances from enterprises to social assistance offices through the&#13;
provision of necessary equipment, and training. The project will fund the implementation of the transfer&#13;
of responsibilities in Belgorod, Kaluga, Moscow, Novgorod, Volgograd oblasts and the Udmurtia&#13;
Republic. The component will include dissemination of the experience of transferring child allowances&#13;
payments, including publishing materials on the evaluation of the experience in the regions to be&#13;
supported by the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
19.          The Unemployment Assistance Component (US$2.46 million total base costs) will&#13;
include provision of technical assistance and training to: (i) design and implement a system to monitor&#13;
unemployment and changes in the type, duration and other characteristics of unemployment as new laws&#13;
or measures are introduced (condition of third tranche release); (ii) draft amendments to the&#13;
Employment Law; (iii) audit the Employment Fund (EF); (iv) assist the Government to draft a new&#13;
Labor Code; (v) review programs designed to support the long-term unemployed; and (vi) evaluate&#13;
experiences with public works programs. More specifically, the component will support the&#13;
establishment of an adequate system of social assistance during the period of heavy unemployment&#13;
providing incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs, reducing the unemployment period and ensuring&#13;
conditions to prevent arrears in the EF. In addition, the component will support the preparation of an&#13;
audit for the EF to assess the accounting practices and financial status of the EF (audit of the EF is a&#13;
condition of third tranche release under the SPAL).&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A.    PROJECT MANAGEMENT&#13;
21.          The proposed project will be implemented by the Russian Foundation for Social&#13;
Reforms and Goskomstat. The Social Protection Offices in Belgorod, Kaluga, Moscow, Novgorod,&#13;
Voronezh, Volgograd oblasts and Komi and Udmurtia Republics will be responsible for the&#13;
implementation of the pilot social assistance and child allowance components of the project.&#13;
22.          Because of the comprehensive nature, large scale, and complexity of the objectives of&#13;
the project comprising several major Government institutions, GOR has assigned responsibility for its&#13;
implementation to the Foundation. The Foundation has been established as a non-commercial&#13;
organization that will operate in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. The&#13;
Foundation will promote institutional reforms in the social sector with a view of improving the legal,&#13;
financial, organizational, information, personnel, and methodological operations of the social sectors.&#13;
More specifically, it will provide organization, technical, informational and analytical support to the&#13;
implementation of the reform of social programs. A Founders Meeting was held on June 26, 1997. The&#13;
Board of Trustees comprises representatives from the Duma, the Ministries of Finance, Economy, Labor&#13;
and Social Development, Health, Education, the State Committee for Statistics, the Pension Fund, the&#13;
Social Insurance Fund, the Federal Mandatory Health Insurance Fund, the Federal Center for Project&#13;
Financing, the Center for Project Preparation and Implementation, the Ministry for Social Issues of the&#13;
Komi Republic, the administrations of Voronezh and Volgograd Oblasts, and two NGOs. The&#13;
Foundation has a General Assembly of Founders, a Board of Trustees, a Management Board, a&#13;
Directorate, and an Expert Council to serve as a consultative body on technical issues.&#13;
23.          The General Assembly of Founders is the supreme body of administration of the&#13;
Foundation, carrying out its powers as stipulated by its Charter (Schedule B). The Board of Trustees has&#13;
overall responsibility for control over activities of the Foundation, including use of resources. The&#13;
Management Board is responsible for the implementation of the objectives and purposes as specified in&#13;
the Foundation's Charter. The Directorate is the executive body of the Foundation in charge of&#13;
managing the operations of the Foundation. The Expert Council is the professional expert body of the&#13;
Foundation. The Foundation's annual budget, operating procedures, and key personnel will be subject to&#13;
Bank prior review. The first year's budget has been agreed upon with the Bank. Appointment of key&#13;
staff has been made in consultation with the Bank3 and on the basis of short lists. Subsequent budgets&#13;
will be agreed with the Bank as part of reviews of annual work programs and budgets.&#13;
24.          The Foundation will be responsible for implementation functions such as project&#13;
accounting, procurement, disbursements, preparation and consolidation of quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports, annual work programs, and budgets. A SPIL Director has been appointed to oversee overall&#13;

project implementation. To ensure efficient implementation of all project activities, four Component&#13;
Coordinators (CCs), one for each of the areas of reform under the SPAL are being appointed -- Pensions,&#13;
Social Assistance/Social Protection, Child Allowance, and Unemployment Assistance. One of the&#13;
Component Coordinators will also serve as the Deputy SPIL Director. To facilitate coordination at the&#13;
oblast level, one staff in each of the social protection offices will be designated to liaise with the Social&#13;
Assistance and Child Allowance Component Coordinators4. These staff will be the focal points for pilot&#13;
activities, including contacts with the SPIL Unit. The CCs will report directly to the SPIL Director. The&#13;
project will include technical assistance and training to local and national administrators in the areas of&#13;
project and financial management, and specific technical areas. Technical assistance will be directed&#13;
particularly towards developing sector-specific management skills in the areas of pensions, social&#13;
assistance, child allowance, and unemployment systems, so that in addition to the benefits to the&#13;
implementing agencies, there will be efficiency gains in the management of these programs. More&#13;
details on institutional arrangements are presented in Schedule A of the Technical Annex.&#13;

Business, and as appropriate, will be updated and published annually thereafter. For goods to be&#13;
obtained by ICB, individual bidding opportunities will also be advertised, in a major local newspaper&#13;
thirty (30) days prior to availability of bidding documents and transmitted to potential bidders who&#13;
expressed interest in bidding in response to the published General Procurement Notice. The local&#13;
advertisement procedure will be repeated for all bidding packages utilizing ICB (at least 30 days in&#13;
advance of availability of bidding documents). The local advertisements will be in the English language&#13;
and at the option of the Borrower, also in Russian.&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
27.          Consultant assignments to be contracted are estimated at US$14.29 million. Consulting&#13;
Services will be contracted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency, published by the Bank in January 1997 (The Consultant Guidelines). A total&#13;
of US$18.10 has been allocated for technical assistance and training, which the Bank will finance 100&#13;
percent net of taxes. Firms and individuals will be selected for consultant assignments in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. As far as practicable, the contracts will be packaged to include a&#13;
combination of related skills and services to increase the size and, therefore, the market interest in each&#13;
contract and reduce the number of contracts to be administered. The Terms of Reference (TOR) for all&#13;
assignments will be subject to Bank's prior review. The following methods of procurement,&#13;
summarized in Schedule E will be followed:&#13;
(a)    Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures will be used for consultant&#13;
contracts up to an aggregate amount of US$7.97 million;&#13;
(b)   Individual Consultant procedures will be used for consultant contracts with&#13;
individuals up to an aggregate of US$2.93 million. Many of the services to be provided under the&#13;
Project involve the contracting of specialized experts, both national and international, as individuals&#13;
where expert knowledge of the various disciplines to be treated under the Project is the paramount&#13;
requirement;&#13;
(c)    Single Source Selection procedures will be used for assignments to three specialized&#13;
Russian research institutes to provide specialized technical assistance services which are a continuation&#13;
of previous work, represent unique qualifications, and whose individual assignments are relatively small,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$370,000.&#13;
(d)    Least Cost Selection procedures will be used to contract for audit services up to&#13;
US$3.02 million as it is an assignment of a standard nature and well established practices and standards&#13;
exist.&#13;
Training&#13;
28.          Seminars/Workshops. The Foundation will develop an initial plan for carrying out of&#13;
seminars and workshops which will be submitted for prior review by the Bank. This plan will include,&#13;
inter alia, the content, audience, schedule, and estimated costs. The status of the plan will be included as&#13;
part of the quarterly progress reports and would be updated and/or modified as may be mutually agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
between the Foundation and the Bank. Consultants to coordinate training seminars will be hired under&#13;
individual contracts and travel costs of seminar participants will be directly reimbursed.&#13;
29.          Overseas Study Tours. A limited number of study tours will be financed under the&#13;
Project. The Foundation, will develop an initial plan which will include for overseas study tours the&#13;
purpose, names/titles of participants, along with itinerary and estimated costs. This plan will be&#13;
submitted for prior review by the Bank. The status of this plan would be included as part of the quarterly&#13;
progress reports and updated and/or modified as may be mutually agreed between the Foundation and the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Goods&#13;
30.          Goods (US$9.26 million) consist of computer, other office equipment, and furniture. To&#13;
minimize the number of contracts and reduce unit costs, equipment and materials to be financed under&#13;
the Loan would be combined into large packages to the extent practicable. The following procurement&#13;
methods would be followed:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for packages above&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent for an estimated total cost of US$7.30 million (79% of total goods). Two bid&#13;
packages are planned under ICB.&#13;
(b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures will be followed for office equipment&#13;
that are locally available and are unlikely to attract foreign competition) for a total of US$0.2 million&#13;
(2% of total goods). This will involve one package. Advertisements will be in local newspapers.&#13;
Interested foreign suppliers will be eligible to participate. Standardized bidding documents, developed&#13;
by the ECA Region, will be used.&#13;
(c)   International and National Shopping (IS and NS) procedures will be followed for&#13;
purchases estimated to cost an aggregate of US$1.76 million (19% of total goods). IS and NS will be&#13;
used for readily available off-the-shelf goods of standard specifications that are small in value. IS&#13;
procedures will be used for goods valued at less than US$300,000 up to an aggregate of about US$1.69&#13;
million and NS procedures will be used for goods valued at less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate of&#13;
about US$75,000. It is expected that miscellaneous office equipment and supplies, non-proprietary spare&#13;
parts and certain teaching/learning materials/equipment will be procured using IS and NS procedures. IS&#13;
procedures will require quotations from at least three suppliers from two different countries and for NS&#13;
procedures, quotations from at least three local suppliers. For IS, about 9 bid packages and for NS, about&#13;
two bid packages are anticipated.&#13;

31.          For contracts for goods to be awarded on the basis of ICB, the Borrower may, as set&#13;
forth in the Loan Agreement, grant a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids up to 15% or the&#13;
amount of applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, to qualified domestic manufacturers of goods&#13;
in accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995, revised January and August&#13;
1996). It is anticipated that Russian suppliers and/or manufacturers will be competitive for the supply of&#13;
goods.&#13;
32.          Publications. Competitive selection procedures will be used for printing of national&#13;
guidelines on the child allowance pilots, public information campaigns, and training materials by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
publishers. National Shopping (NS), up to an aggregate amount of US$0.45 million and National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) up to an aggregate amount of US$0.19 will be used.&#13;
33.          Operating Costs of the Foundation. The Foundation has been established as the&#13;
implementing agency for the project and as such the loan will finance its operating costs. These include&#13;
local personnel for the Foundation, local travel, office rental, utility services, equipment operation and&#13;
maintenance, and office supplies based upon an annual budget acceptable to the Bank. The local&#13;
personnel are being recruited following a short list selection and TOR agreed upon with the Bank. Level&#13;
of salaries of the personnel have been agreed with the Bank and are comparable to other implementing&#13;
agencies of Bank-financed projects in Russia.&#13;
34.          Operating Costs of Goskomstat. Includes incremental operating costs of Goskomstat&#13;
to undertake the household survey of 30,000 households three times during the course of the project.&#13;
The Foundation will provide procurement and disbursement services to Goskomstat. Operating costs&#13;
will include hiring of individual interviewers and supervisors, development of survey instruments,&#13;
coding of data, travel and subsistence of interviewers and other related costs. Interviewers will be hired&#13;
from a list of qualified registered interviewers.&#13;
35.          Bank Review. Prior review by the Bank will be exercised for the following&#13;
procurement documents:&#13;
* all ICBs for goods and the first two International and National Shopping contracts;&#13;
*  all consulting services contracts with firms estimated at or above US$100,000, and with&#13;
individuals estimated at US$50,000 equivalent;&#13;
*  all extension of contracts with firms raising the contract value at or above US$100,000&#13;
equivalent;&#13;
*  all extension of contracts with individuals raising the contract value at or above&#13;
US$50,000; and&#13;
*  all Letters of Invitation.&#13;
36.          All other contracts will be subject to sampling post-review during supervision missions.&#13;
Information on procurement will be collected and recorded by the Foundation to provide: (i) prompt&#13;
reporting of contract awards by the Borrower; (ii) quarterly reports to the Bank; and (iii) changes in&#13;
procurement schedules, including advertising, bidding, contract awards and completion dates.&#13;
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)&#13;
37.          A CPAR has not been prepared for the Russian Federation. For this Project, the&#13;
Government will follow agreed Bank procurement procedures as described above and as set forth in the&#13;
Loan Agreement.&#13;
C.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
38.          It is expected that the proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed over a period of four&#13;
years, which includes six months for completion of accounts and submission of withdrawal applications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
As there is no standard disbursement profile for the Russian Federation, the disbursement forecast is&#13;
based on the Bank's experience in financing similar technical assistance projects in Russia and other&#13;
countries in the FSU and is based on detailed work programs. Table 4.2 estimates disbursements during&#13;
the project period.&#13;

39.          Disbursements will be managed by the Disbursement Specialist in the Foundation. Part&#13;
of the funds of the loan are expected to be disbursed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
for all expenses, except those covered by contracts requiring prior review by the Bank. SOEs will be&#13;
certified locally by the Foundation. Goskomstat will submit SOEs for reimbursement of survey costs.&#13;
Disbursement for contracts requiring prior review will be made against full documentation and&#13;
respective procurement guidelines. Related documentation in support of SOEs will not be submitted to&#13;
the Bank, but will be retained by the Foundation for at least one year, after receipt by the Bank of the&#13;
audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made. This documentation will be made&#13;
available for review by the auditors and Bank supervision missions. If ineligible expenditures, included&#13;
those not justified by the evidence furnished, or amounts in excess of agreed disbursement percentages&#13;
are financed from the Special Account (SA), the Bank will have the right to withhold further deposits in&#13;
the SA. The Bank may exercise this right until the Borrower has: (a) refunded the amounts involved, or&#13;
(b) (if the Bank agrees) submitted evidence of other eligible expenditures that the Bank can use to offset&#13;
the ineligible amounts. The minimum amount of each withdrawal application for direct payment will be&#13;
$50,000. A detailed disbursement forecast is presented in Schedule G. Funds disbursed under the PPF&#13;
will be repaid from the proposed Loan funds after Loan effectiveness. The Project Completion date is&#13;
estimated to be July 31, 2001 and the Closing Date is estimated to be December 31, 2001.&#13;
40.          Special Account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the Borrower will&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars&#13;
in a commercial bank. During the early stage of the project, the initial authorized allocation of the&#13;
Special Account will be limited to US$1.0 million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under&#13;
the loan have reached the level of $4.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to an authorized&#13;
allocation of $2.0 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment&#13;
applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank&#13;
statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;

D.    RECORDS AND AUDITING&#13;
41.          The Foundation will be responsible for keeping records and accounts. The Accountant&#13;
in the Foundation will establish a financial management system classified by component to provide&#13;
information on the proper receipt and use of funds. Accounting for all SA transactions, including for&#13;
SOEs, and all other project accounts will be maintained in accordance with practices and standards&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, with the objective of timely and accurate account of all transactions under the&#13;
project. The Foundation will be responsible for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that&#13;
audits of the financial statement, the SA, project accounts, and SOEs will be performed by an&#13;
independent audit firm, acceptable to the Bank. Financial reporting will be geared to the specific&#13;
requirements of the Project and will comprise a full statement of receipts and payments from the&#13;
project's inception. Reporting will be in accordance with disbursements classified and reported under&#13;
each category of expenditure as specified in the Loan Agreement. The Foundation will submit quarterly&#13;
progress and financial reports, which will include: (a) a summary of project activities by component; (b)&#13;
a description of the main achievements against agreed implementation and disbursement targets, and of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
the problems encountered; (c) recommendations on how to solve problems and comments on progress in&#13;
implementing previous recommendations; (d) a description of component activities; and (e) a&#13;
presentation of the financial situation of the project in terms of actual versus budget for the major&#13;
expenditure categories and the financial situation of each component. A month after the end of each&#13;
quarter, the Foundation will prepare quarterly progress reports with inputs from the implementing&#13;
agencies. By December I each year, each implementing agency will prepare annual work programs and&#13;
budgets, and by February 15 annual progress reports, which shall then be made available to the Bank.&#13;
The work programs, quarterly and annual reports will be prepared by each implementing agency. The&#13;
reports from the oblasts will be consolidated by the Foundation with an introduction describing the major&#13;
achievements and problems. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
42.          In addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that by December 31, 1998: (a) the&#13;
Borrower shall undertake an interim review of the implementation of the project in consultation with,&#13;
and in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) by March 31, 1999 prepare and furnish to the Bank a&#13;
report regarding the results of the interim review, including progress achieved in the implementation of&#13;
the project and measures recommended to ensure the achievement of project objectives during the&#13;
remainder of the project implementation period.&#13;
Accounts and Auditing&#13;
43.          The Foundation will maintain a single set of project accounts, including the Special&#13;
Account. Project records will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for financial Reporting and&#13;
Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982) and the Financial Accounting,&#13;
Reporting and Auditing Handbook (1995). All project accounts (including the Special Account and&#13;
SOEs) will be subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The annual&#13;
audit report will be submitted by the Foundation to the Bank within six months after the end of the&#13;
Government's Fiscal Year.&#13;
E.    BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
44.          Intensive Bank supervision will be required, especially during the first year of project&#13;
implementation to help identify and solve problems at an early stage and to ensure that the conditions of&#13;
release of the second and third tranches under the SPAL are being fulfilled in a timely fashion. The first&#13;
supervision missions will concentrate on monitoring of procurement of goods and the mobilization of&#13;
consultants. The Supervision Plan in Annex G estimates a requirement of 34 staff weeks of mission&#13;
work for the first year of project implementation, spread over 3 missions, and 52 staff weeks for five&#13;
additional supervision missions to be undertaken during the remaining two and a half years of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

V.    PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.    PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
45.          The project will provide critical support to the implementation of the overall social&#13;
sector reforms supported by the SPAL, including important changes in the policy framework, the&#13;
regulatory system, and in the performance of the social sector institutions themselves (Pension Fund and&#13;
Employment Fund). The initiatives introduced under the SPAL and supported by related institutional&#13;
capacity under the SPIL will address the inefficiencies of the previous system of social protection and are&#13;
expected to be determinant in reshaping them to meet the needs of a market economy and lay a solid&#13;
foundation on which Russia can build a pension and welfare system that corresponds to its needs. The&#13;
initiatives will achieve: (i) higher pensions and regular pension payment to be secured for some 4 million&#13;
of the poorest pensioners; (ii) minimum unemployment benefits at a level which will allow a somewhat&#13;
better standard of living for the unemployed; (iii) stabilization of the current US$27 billion per year&#13;
(5.5% of GDP) pension system by reducing/eliminating arrears and therefore improving the revenue base&#13;
of the PF, and better financial management of the PF; (iv) systemic pension reform, i.e. voluntary&#13;
pension legislation will have been enacted, and the process of enacting legislation for reform will have&#13;
reach the legislature, supported by a strong public campaign to explain the trade offs; (v) restructuring of&#13;
the unemployment benefit system; (vi) revisions of the Labor Code to provide a market-oriented&#13;
framework for employer-employee relations; (vii) restructuring of the US$2.8 billion per year (1% of&#13;
GDP) child allowance program towards an affordable, poverty-targeted, means-tested program; and (viii)&#13;
restructuring of he US$3.5 billion per year (1.25% of GDP) program of short-term social insurance&#13;
benefits, focusing exclusively on sickness and maternity benefits.&#13;
B.    PROJECT RISKS&#13;
46.          As the proposed operation is driven by the need to implement the social sector&#13;
restructuring program, an important risk is related to uncertain political support to the reform agenda.&#13;
However, the current Government is strongly committed to social sector reform and is actively&#13;
promoting its reform agenda. Concomitantly, commitment to the SPAL agenda has been growing among&#13;
stakeholders and there is now a broad domestic constituency supporting proposed reforms. There&#13;
remains, however, significant political risks that need to be recognized. The main ones noted in the&#13;
SPAL documents relate to pension reform and the need to secure parliamentary approval for each of the&#13;
major legislation initiatives for reform. These risks are being mitigated by the promotion of project&#13;
ownership through a participatory approach in the design and implementation of the project by key&#13;
stakeholders. In addition, there are risks or potential delays in project implementation, due to the&#13;
complexity of the restructuring program, the involvement of a large number of stakeholders, and the&#13;
inexperience of the Foundation in implementation of Bank procurement procedures and management of&#13;
foreign technical assistance.&#13;
47.          To minimize these risks, the Project is providing for early mobilization of procurement&#13;
consultants financed under the PDL and a PPF, setting mechanisms in place for early establishment of&#13;
mechanisms for record keeping, operation of the special account, and preparation of procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
documentation for key activities to be implemented during the first year of project implementation.&#13;
Moreover, the institutional constraints are an explicit element of the Bank's assistance strategy and are&#13;
being addressed through the institutional changes that the SPAL and the SPIL are supporting, which will&#13;
emphasize administration and staff training to ensure adequate implementation of policies, as well as&#13;
complementarity with NGOs. Fiscal federal responsibilities will be redesigned to provide appropriate&#13;
support in the crucial areas of social assistance and child allowances. Full institutional transformation&#13;
(particularly when existing institutions have largely functioned as implementing agencies) cannot be&#13;
achieved overnight. This is a focused start that will be pursued under future projects that are expected to&#13;
build on the SPAL and expand its policy and institutional changes, including this project&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
PENSION COMPONENT&#13;
ANNEX 1.1 - SENIOR POLICY ADVISER TO THE MLSD&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to review and reform its&#13;
national pension system, as part of a reform of the Government's social policy and safety net programs.&#13;
The Government has strengthened its leadership structure by appointing a new First Deputy Prime&#13;
Minister in charge of social policy, the Ministries of Labor and Social Protection have been consolidated&#13;
into a single ministry, and a number of middle-level reform minded officials have been appointed to&#13;
positions of influence. In addition, the President has established commissions to develop proposals for&#13;
systemic pension reform and a formal medium-term social strategy. Finally, a series of legislative&#13;
initiatives are underway that are designed to reform the pension system.&#13;
2.           The World Bank approved in June 25, 1997 a Social Protection Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SPAL) which is designed to improve the poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social protection&#13;
system. The program calls for reforms in the pension system, social assistance, social protection, child&#13;
allowances, and unemployment assistance. Reform actions by the Government will involve, inter alia,&#13;
measures to maintain the pension "floor" at a minimum level equal to a percentage of minimum elderly&#13;
subsistence, development of a concept document on systemic pension reform, and eventual enactment of&#13;
legislation for systemic pension reform. The SPAL will be accompanied by a policy implementation&#13;
loan (SPIL) which will support the implementation of these efforts over a three year period.&#13;
3.           While there is agreement on the need for reform of the pension system among Russian&#13;
decision-makers, there is no consensus yet on the design of the reform. The Government is advocating a&#13;
multi-pillar system, including a public pillar emphasizing poverty reduction, a funded second pillar, and&#13;
voluntary private pension schemes. This is set out in a Government Letter of Social Policy of June 5,&#13;
1997. Carrying out this program will involve simulations for the long-term impact of determining&#13;
requirements of alternative public plans, a new legal and institutional framework, and developing a&#13;
public information campaign.&#13;
4.           The SPIL will provide specialized technical assistance to the Ministry of Labor and&#13;
Social Development (MLSD) over a period of three years. At the start, however, the First Deputy&#13;
Minister of Labor and Social Development has requested the services of a senior pensions advisor to&#13;
assist him and the MLSD design the early steps and strategies for this effort, and lay the foundation for&#13;
the reform effort.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           The objective of this consultancy is to provide strategic and operational policy guidance&#13;
to the MLSD in the development of systemic pension reform for the Russian Federation. The consultant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26-&#13;
will work with key policy makers in the MLSD to design efforts to: (i) reform and stabilize the public&#13;
pension system to operate more efficiently and provide income security against poverty during old age;&#13;
and (ii) develop public and private mechanisms that provide affordable income "smoothing" involving a&#13;
new, multi-tier system to eventually replace the old system.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
6.           As part of the SPAL program, the Government has undertaken the obligation to&#13;
introduce minimum pension legislation to the Federal Assembly, and several other actions involving&#13;
Pension Fund (PF) and budget allocations for contributions and indexation of the pension floor, and&#13;
improved collections for the PF. Of critical importance is the development and adoption of a "Concept&#13;
Paper" on systemic pension reform involving introduction of a three tier pension system. The paper will&#13;
analyze in detail the choices made and the requirements for implementation of systemic reform,&#13;
including a strategy for a public information and education program on the reforrn.&#13;
7.           The consultant will work closely with key MLSD policy and operational staff in the&#13;
development of this concept paper by providing expert advice on the full range of options that may be&#13;
considered in the development of a three tier system involving (a) one or more publicly financed&#13;
programs for poverty alleviation; (b) one or more mandatory earnings-related programs, which in turn&#13;
would be fully or at least partly capitalized; and (c) one or more voluntary earnings-related pension&#13;
regimes, which in the long run should be fully capitalized. The experiences of other Former Soviet&#13;
Union countries in these efforts should be explored and considered. To the extent possible, the expert&#13;
will also advise on the development of specific legislative and operational proposals and steps.&#13;
8.           As part of the concept paper, the consultant will also assist the MLSD in the preparation&#13;
of a long-term overall implementation plan to reform and stabilize the public pension system, and&#13;
develop public and private mechanisms that provide affordable income smoothing.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
9.           The consultant will provide up to six person months of services which can be&#13;
accomplished at one time or in periodic visits, as required and agreed to with the MLSD. A possible&#13;
extension of the assignment will be decided upon by the Deputy Minister of Labor and Social&#13;
Development.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
10.          The consultant should possess an advanced degree in public administration or finance,&#13;
with at least ten years of experience in managing or consulting to pension systems in countries with&#13;
viable pension systems and/or countries undergoing pension reform. The consultant should have a&#13;
re,ord of providing policy advice at the policy-making levels of government, have an expert knowledge&#13;
of main types of pension systems used by countries around the world, with specific experience dealing&#13;
with FSU pension system analysis and reform highly desirable. Written and/or spoken Russian is&#13;
desirable.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
11.          The consultant will develop a draft outline of a concept paper and assist the MLSD in&#13;
assigning of specific analytical tasks to individuals. Where necessary, the consultant will assist in the&#13;
preparation of terms of reference for local or international consultants to be recruited to assist in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
paper's preparation. The consultant will also assist in the preparation of a draft implementation plan for&#13;
pension reform covering the next two years of the program's execution. As required the consultant will&#13;
prepare specialized reports on topics where his expertise will be required, and briefing papers for senior&#13;
staff on different aspects of policy and operational reforms. Finally, the consultant will prepare a final&#13;
report summarizing his/her views and recommendations for future actions.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
12.           The consultant will work in the office of the First Deputy Minister of Labor and Social&#13;
Development, and work with that official and the other senior officials involved in pension reform. The&#13;
consultant will be provided with support by MLSD support staff.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION IMPLEMENTATION LOAN&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
PENSION COMPONENT&#13;
ANNEX 1.3 - SURVEY AND DRAFTING OF TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PENSION FUND AUDIT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to review and reform its national&#13;
pension system as part of a general reform of the government's social policy and safety net programs. The&#13;
Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustrnent Loan (SPAL) is designed to improve the poverty focus and&#13;
institutional capacity of the social protection system. The reforms involve, inter alia, measures to maintain&#13;
the pension "floor" at a minimum level equal to a percentage of minimum elderly subsistence, development&#13;
of a concept paper on systemic pension reform, and eventual enactment of legislation for systemic pension&#13;
reform.&#13;
2.           The Pension Fund (PF) is an important part of the social protection system. It is&#13;
responsible for collecting all pension contributions. In regions containing some 20 percent of the pension&#13;
population, it is also responsible for the calculation and payment of pensions, and plans have been&#13;
developed to shift this responsibility to the PF in all regions of the Federation. The institutional implications&#13;
of systemic reform have not been determined yet. Whatever they are, however, the PF will most likely&#13;
continue to be responsible for the financing and/or the paying of pensions to current pensioners and to those&#13;
approaching pensionable age for some time. Depending on the shape of the reforms finally adopted, the PF&#13;
may continue to finance and pay pensions indefinitely.&#13;
3.           In response to a request from the Pension Fund, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) reviewed the collection procedures currently employed by the PF and&#13;
developed a series of recommendations designed to increase the collection process. These included changes&#13;
in the financial management system affecting the manner in which the accounting and finance staffs receive&#13;
and process collection reports and the creation of a comprehensive administrative budget for the PF. One&#13;
on the conditions in the SPAL program is that the government prepare an action plan to implement the&#13;
various IMF recommendations and report regularly on the progress to implement that plan.&#13;
4.           Another condition in the SPAL program is that the government undertake a financial&#13;
review of the PF. The government is to prepare and furnish to the bank a preliminary survey of this&#13;
financial review by December 1997, and to have completed the review in accordance with this preliminary&#13;
survey prior to June 1998. These terms of reference (TOR) apply to the consultant who will be employed to&#13;
conduct the preliminary survey.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           The financial review is to lead, as quickly as possible, to the production of a set of financial&#13;
statements for the PF which are prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and are&#13;
shown through independent audit to be in conformance with those standards. This process will assure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32 -&#13;
the financial management practices and procedures are as efficient and effective as possible and that the&#13;
moneys collected by the PF are managed efficiently and expended as intended. The current financial&#13;
structure and accounting methods of the PF may preclude conducting a formal audit, however, without first&#13;
modifying the accounting methods and systems to conform more closely to international practices. Such&#13;
modifications must take into account any conflicts which may exist between the accounting and auditing&#13;
requirements imposed on the PF by Russian law and international accounting and auditing practices.&#13;
6.           The consultant to be employed under this task will survey the accounting practices and&#13;
financial statements of the PF, determine the extent to which they conform or deviate from international&#13;
standards, review the impact on the financial management system of the actions being taken by the PF in&#13;
response to the IMF recommendations, and develop the terms of reference for the subsequent financial&#13;
review. This subsequent financial review will be performed by a major international auditing firm. It will&#13;
be designed to: (a) present an objective assessment of the PF's financial situation and (b) make&#13;
recommendations for the changes in its financial systems and accounting practices which will allow the&#13;
production of financial statements that can be audited in conformance with international standards.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
7.           Task One-Review of Current Procedures. The consultant will review the current&#13;
financial management procedures and compile a composite picture of the PF's administrative structure&#13;
and payment systems. Based on this review, the consultant will provide an opinion on the degree to&#13;
which the current financial systems can be relied upon to produce financial statements that are in&#13;
compliance with international accounting standards and recommendations of the areas where these&#13;
systems may have to be adjusted in order to produce such statements.&#13;
8.           Task Two - TOR for Financial Review. The consultant will then draw up the TOR to be&#13;
used for the subsequent comprehensive financial review of the PF. Such terms will take into account the&#13;
characteristics of the current procedures, any particular requirements of Russian law, the time frames&#13;
incorporated for the financial review in the SPAL, and the fimding available for the review. The TOR&#13;
will also specify that the audit will be undertaken in accordance with the Regulations specified in the&#13;
Government Resolution on the audit. To the extent appropriate, the TOR should include:&#13;
* production of a balance sheet, an income statement, and a cash flow statement for both the PF&#13;
program and PF administrative accounts at December 31, 1996 and the year then ended.&#13;
These statements should be in an internationally accepted format and, to the extent possible,&#13;
in conformity with international accounting standards;&#13;
* provision of a professional opinion on the restated financial statements with an explanation of&#13;
which items do not comply with international standards and an estimate of the impact of such&#13;
differences;&#13;
* identification of weaknesses in the current system of internal controls and recommendation of&#13;
measures necessary to correct these weaknesses so as to reduce the possibility of fraud;&#13;
* recommendations to the appropriate authorities for: (i) changes in the financial management&#13;
processes and the associated accounting systems which will improve efficiency and enable&#13;
the preparation of a financial statement that comply with international accounting standards,&#13;
and (ii) a practical sequence of steps to be taken to institute these changes; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
* identification of staff training needs and hardware and software needs in order to introduce&#13;
the changes and manage the new system.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
9.           This assignment is estimated to require six weeks.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
10.          The consultant should: (a) be trained in accounting and financial management, (b) have at&#13;
least two years experience working with accounting systems in the Russian Federation or other FSU&#13;
countries, (c) have experience in working with financial management systems in western public or private&#13;
pension programs, life insurance companies, or enterprises engaged in similar activities and be fully&#13;
qualified to perform audits according to international standards. Ability to speak and read Russian is&#13;
desirable.&#13;
F. Outputs&#13;
11.          The consultant will supply a report on current financial management procedures as outlined&#13;
in Task One and the TOR outlined in Task Two.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
12.          The Ministry of Finance will establish a high level working group to oversee the&#13;
preparation of all audit and financial systems development work. It will have representation from the&#13;
MLSD, the State Tax Service, the Pension Fund and the Government Apparat. The PF will establish an&#13;
internal working group to work with the consultant and provide information and financial documentation&#13;
sufficient to enable the consultant to make determinations necessary to the accomplishment of the work&#13;
to be performed. The consultant will use this material and guidance to prepare detailed TOR for the&#13;
performance of the financial review.&#13;
13.          The consultant will be provided space at the headquarters of the PF and work with the&#13;
First Deputy Minister of the MLSD, and the other senior officials involved in pension reform, as well as&#13;
the working groups established by the Ministry of Finance and the Pension Fund.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
PENSION COMPONENT&#13;
ANNEX 1.4 - PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           During the period of transition for social policies it is essential to communicate the&#13;
strategy and objective to the population at large and specific stakeholder groups. Case studies have&#13;
shown that that social safety net reform is only sustainable when governments have been able to&#13;
communicate the trade-offs to the population. The area of pension reform is very difficult as it often&#13;
deals with contentious issues such as raising the retirement age or changing the structure of benefits. It is&#13;
necessary for governments to convey its efforts at long-term reform and sustainability of the system&#13;
while maintaining poverty targeted interventions in order to gain a consensus.&#13;
2.           The Government of Russia is implementing a program of changes in the social&#13;
protection policies of the country. As part of this program the Government wishes to implement a&#13;
comprehensive public information campaign in the area of pensions to inform the population at large.&#13;
Gaining a consensus in this area will be difficult considering most people are not well informed about the&#13;
current pension system nor the possible options for change. As a result an informed populace or&#13;
consensus can only be achieved by an intensive, well-considered and organized campaign. The&#13;
campaign will need to both provide informnation and respond to misinformation about the possible&#13;
changes.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
3.           The objective of the campaign is to inform the country as a whole about the changes in&#13;
the structure of the pension system. In addition, it will be important to target certain stakeholders with&#13;
specific information regarding the program and possible changes in their benefits. These groups could&#13;
include veterans, elderly, those currently eligible for early retirement in certain industries, disabled. In&#13;
particular, the aim of the campaign is the following:&#13;
*  establish communication channels through which consistent, comprehensive, timely and&#13;
clear information can be provided on the various aspects of the systemic pension reform to&#13;
workers, pensioners, lawmakers as well as the country at large;&#13;
*  effectively communicate the current situation in the Russian pension system;&#13;
*  promptly inform the public about the specifics of the reform program undertaken by the&#13;
Government and the subsequent stages of implementation of the program;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36 -&#13;
*  ensure full transparency of the restructuring program and provide pensioners with&#13;
information regarding their full rights and practical arrangements for the restructuring&#13;
process;&#13;
*  form a positive public attitude towards the pension reform program by demonstrating other&#13;
successful cases; benefits of the new system and long-term viability of the new system; and&#13;
*  facilitate open channels of information dissemination and foster a sustained dialogue and&#13;
participation amongst stakeholders and the population at the local level.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
4.           Task One - Preparation of the communications campaign. This will include assessing&#13;
the current information and perceptions regarding the pension systems and possible changes in the&#13;
system. This is likely to include using a survey instrument to obtain information on public perception.&#13;
This will be essential as a starting point for monitoring the public's perception of changes in the system.&#13;
5.           Task Two - Analysis ofpossible public response. In order to prepare for the campaign it&#13;
is necessary to understand the issues and possible reactions to the reform program. This should be done&#13;
as a result of the surveys conducted above.&#13;
6.           Task Three - Development of a Work Plan. A Work Plan will be developed which will&#13;
include the strategy for implementation of the public information campaign and a timeline of proposed&#13;
core activities. A final version of this Work Plan must be agreed with the Russian Foundation for Social&#13;
Reforms (RFSR).&#13;
7.           Task Four - Compilation of a database. A database of relevant federal and regional&#13;
media organizations and establishing an up-to-date scope of their outreach by geographical area, target&#13;
group and ratings will be compiled for use during the implementation of the program.&#13;
8.           Task Five - Monitoring and Assessment. Continuous monitoring and assessment of&#13;
information needs of respective stakeholder groups will be required in order to have current knowledge&#13;
of the perceptions. This will require assessing the position of the groups including possible stakeholder&#13;
group meetings, interaction with individual stakeholders, monitoring of local and federal media and&#13;
possibly conducting small scale opinion research surveys.&#13;
9.           Task Six - Media Monitoring. Conducting on-going media monitoring of press&#13;

and provide them with media training. This is important in order for the transition leaders to&#13;
communicate well on their own with the visual and print media. The Consultant will also develop&#13;
regional seminars for MLSD social workers to communicate information on pension reform to clients.&#13;
12.          Task Nine - Information Dissemination. Timely dissemination of information and&#13;

questions (FAQ) and the answers. This will provide anyone who deals with the media including&#13;
Government officials with uniform and non-contradictory messages on various issues. This can be&#13;
condensed and put in various publications as well. Consideration should be given to using the FAQ for a&#13;
toll-free number which the population can call and someone will answer questions on the reform as&#13;
implementation begins.&#13;
14.          Task Eleven - Institutional Support. Providing institutional support to the Ministry of&#13;
Labor and Social Development and the Foundation for Social Sector Reforrns to ensure the sustainability&#13;

ANNEX 1.5 - SHORT TERM SUPPORT FOR PENSION REFORM&#13;
A. Background&#13;
I .          The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to review and reform its national&#13;
pension system as part of a general reform of the government's social policy and safety net programs. The&#13;
Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL) is designed to improve the poverty focus and&#13;
institutional capacity of the social protection system. The reforms involve, inter alia, measures to maintain&#13;
the pension "floor" at a minimum level equal to a percentage of minimum elderly subsistence, development&#13;
of a concept document on systemic pension reform, and eventual enactment of legislation for systemic&#13;
pension reform.&#13;
2.           The Government's pension reform strategy is to introduce as soon as possible a three-tier&#13;
system built around a mandatory system of funded, earnings-related, pensions using the individual account&#13;
approach. It would be complemented by a first tier providing minimum income security and protection&#13;
against poverty for the elderly, and one or more voluntary, earnings-related regimes. Currently, the&#13;
Government is in the process of initiating the legal and regulatory work necessary for the reform. Already,&#13;
legislation on voluntary pensions is being considered by the Federal Assembly.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
3.           In order to facilitate the process of reform, a number of short-term consultancies will be&#13;
required in the areas of economics, pension systems, economics, law, financial market development,&#13;
pension modeling, etc., to assist in moving the process forward.&#13;
C Job Description&#13;
4.           Qualified local or international consultants will undertake short-term consultancies to&#13;
support the development of the Government's systemic pension reform. Such consultancies may take&#13;
the form of assisting and advising the authorities on specific aspects of the reform, the provision of&#13;
focused workshops and seminars, and the arrangement of study tours. Need will be deternined on a case&#13;
by case basis by the Government (the Government's task force on pension reform), in collaboration with&#13;
its Senior Policy Adviser. Tasks will include the tasks listed below.&#13;
5.           Developing the legal, regulatory and political framework for private funds ensuring that&#13;
the framework law for voluntary private pensions/retirement savings provides for a transparent system&#13;
that separates enterprise and pension financing, protects workers' rights, fosters labor mobility and tax&#13;
neutrality and contributes to capital formulation and risk diversification. Other tasks could include: (i)&#13;
preparing legislation and regulations necessary for the creation of viable private pension funds; (ii)&#13;
obtaining the commitment of the MOF and other relevant Government bodies to allow tax deferrals or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
other financial incentives for private pension fund investors; (iii) adopting a pragmatic approach to legal&#13;
reform that will advance the legal framework quickly; and (iv) drafting a new law to regulate a gradual&#13;
transfer of early retirement pensions granted for work under special labor conditions into non-&#13;
governmental pension funds within the framework of establishing vocational pension systems.&#13;
6.           Designing the legal framework to regulate investment managers, fund administrators and&#13;
monitor accounts. It will be necessary to develop a legal framework to more tightly manage the&#13;
management of private and voluntary funds. It is essential that the assets of the funds be separate from&#13;
those of the management company. It is also necessary to make provisions for proper custodial&#13;
arrangements to prevent fraud and laws are also needed regarding insider trading.&#13;
7.           Based on the above, creating a regulatory capacity that would oversee private pension&#13;
funds. This might occur initially through a self regulatory organization (SRO). Subsequently the SRO&#13;
could be overseen by a national securities organization, insurance authority, or some other institutional&#13;
arrangement that ensures adequate disclosure, sound portfolio management, and prudent investrnent&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
8.           Assist the Ministry of Labor and Social Development to implement systemic pension&#13;
reform. The Ministry together with other ministries and entities in the Government and the World Bank&#13;
is designing a plan for system pension reform. The Ministry will need assistance to address issues during&#13;
the implementation of this program. This assistance will include: (I) recommendations on the transition&#13;
and possible methods of finance; (ii) coordination with consultants implementing a public information&#13;
campaign; and (iii) discussion of the range of estimates of the macro-economic effects of the chosen&#13;
alternatives;&#13;
9.           Provision of support to coordination of pension reform in the Foundation for Social&#13;
Reform. The Foundation has as one of its major responsibilities the coordination of the logistics of the&#13;
pension reform, including the management and administration of consultancies for the pension reform.&#13;
10.          Designing a Pension Yearbook. Many countries publish a statistical handbook on the&#13;
pension system which outlines the types of pensions, number of people who contribute to each type of&#13;
account and how much they contribute, number of pensions that are paid and the amount paid, what type&#13;
of people are receiving pensions and other information. The Russian Government would like to establish&#13;
such a publication and need assistance to develop the records and design an appropriate format.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
11.          Short-term assignments of between a few days and three weeks, over the period between&#13;
September 1997 and June 1999.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
12.          Individuals with recognized expertise and/or working experience in the particular area of&#13;
consultation.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
13.          The outputs will be determined on a case by case basis, and may consist of formal and&#13;
informal working papers, workshop and seminar presentations, and advisory services.&#13;

ANNEX 1.6 - ORGANIZATION OF ACTUARIAL ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The actuarial profession has its origin in the financial management of life insurance&#13;
companies. Over the years this field has expanded considerably to include work in investment,&#13;
government services, managed health care, and especially retirement benefits schemes. The Russian&#13;
Federation does not have a significant background in the field of actuarial practice and studies adapted to&#13;
free market economies. In order to implement the pension reform and ensure its long term self-&#13;
sustainability, including the development of a viable private pension fund industry, it is necessary for the&#13;
Federation to quickly develop a credible actuarial profession.&#13;
2.           At the present time, there appears to be an informal actuarial profession in the Russian&#13;
Federation. Some consulting firms claim to offer actuarial services. Non-state pension funds offer life-&#13;
long annuities. The State Pension Funds officials refer to their actuarial projections and estimates. There&#13;
is also a fairly large life insurance industry. However, the size, background and knowledge base of the&#13;
actuarial community is unclear. The current contribution of expatriate actuaries is uncertain. It is also&#13;
not known whether formal actuarial study programs are available to Russian students.&#13;
3.           As with other professionals, the development of a credible and competent actuarial&#13;
profession requires effective education and accreditation processes. The actuarial practice also needs to&#13;
be regulated. In most western countries the actuarial profession is governed by one or more self-&#13;
regulatory organizations such as the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries in the&#13;
United States or the Canadian Institute of Actuaries which are responsible for inter alia, the following: (i)&#13;
education and training; (ii) certification; (iii) development and enforcement of rules of conduct and&#13;
standards of practice; (iv) research and development; and (v) disciplining delinquent actuaries.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
4.           The objective of this consultancy is to assess the capacity of the Russian actuarial&#13;
profession to provide effectively the actuarial expertise necessary for the successful implementation of a&#13;
comprehensive reform of the pension system and the development of a viable pension industry, and to&#13;
propose a package of measures to address the deficiencies and identify initiatives that the World Bank&#13;
could take to assist in developing and implementing these measures.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
5.           The consultant is required to complete the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
(a)    Take an inventory of the Russian public and private organizations that use actuarial&#13;
services and describe the nature and scope of the actuarial services that are currently available in Russia;&#13;
(b)    Identify organizations and activities associated with the provision of pension or&#13;
insurance in Russia that would benefit from actuarial expertise but do not currently use it and find out&#13;
why. For example, some non-state pension funds may be offering pension products that contain some&#13;
life contingency guaranties without proper actuarial costing;&#13;
(c)    Estimate the number of practicing actuaries broken down by type of practices i.e.&#13;
pension, life insurance, casualty insurance, etc. and by the type of employers i.e. consulting firm,&#13;
insurance companies, government entities, non-state pension funds, etc. Where significant, the results&#13;
should be broken down between the Moscow area and other regional centers of the Russian Federation.&#13;
The study should also estimate the number of accredited foreign actuaries currently practicing in Russia;&#13;
(d)    Identify situations where the public and/or the government is exposed to immediate&#13;
and/or significant risks because of the lack of adequate actuarial advice or expertise. Recommend&#13;
strategies to deal with these cases and suggest how the World Bank could assist Russia in implementing&#13;
these strategies. Under the SPIL, an allocation of $1 million has been set .aside to deal with urgent needs&#13;
in the actuarial area. For example, in many, if not most, western countries, an actuarial review of the&#13;
state pension funds is performed periodically as a matter of course. Such a practice could be useful in&#13;
Russia. How can the World Bank best assist in establishing such a standard;&#13;
(e)    Survey the nature and extent of the educational and professional background and the&#13;
actual experience and skills of the Russian practicing actuaries, assess their adequacy and identify any&#13;
major deficiencies. Recommend ways to eliminate these gaps and how the World Bank could assist in&#13;
this regard;&#13;
(f)    Assess the availability, scope, quality and adequacy of current actuarial study programs&#13;
in Russia sponsored by universities or other organizations. Find out the extent Russian actuarial students&#13;
are currently pursuing their education through the curriculum of foreign actuarial organizations such as&#13;
the Institute of Actuaries of England. Analyze the gaps and propose ways to effectively address them&#13;
including suggestions as to how the World Bank could assist; and&#13;
(g)    Identify existing associations of Russian practicing actuaries, describe their legal status,&#13;
their membership, their activities, etc. Assess their credibility and current and future capacity to sponsor&#13;
an effective education and accreditation process for actuaries, establish rules of professional conduct,&#13;
develop and enforce standards of practice, train and discipline its members, encourage and further&#13;
actuarial research and development. Identify major deficiencies and make suggestions as to how to deal&#13;
with them.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
6.           It is estimated that the assignment will require approximately 10 weeks.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
7.            The consultant should be an actuary accredited from a widely recognized actuarial&#13;
organization. He/she should have at least 10 years of experience in managing or consulting to pension&#13;
systems in countries with viable pension systems and/or countries undergoing pension reform. The&#13;
consultant should have a record of providing policy advice at the policy-making levels of government,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45 -&#13;
have an expert knowledge of main types of pension systems used by countries around the world, with&#13;
specific experience dealing with Former Soviet Union pension system analysis and reform highly&#13;
desirable. Written and/or spoken Russian is highly desirable.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
8.            The consultant will prepare a report describing in detail: (i) the needs for actuarial&#13;
expertise in Russia; (ii) the actuarial services currently available there; (iii) the profile of the Russian&#13;
practicing actuaries in qualitative and quantitative terms; (iv) the existing actuarial study programs; (v)&#13;
the professional associations; (vi) the actuarial research activities, and (vii) how the Government can best&#13;
use actuaries to regulate the growing insurance and pension business. The report should assess the gaps&#13;
and deficiencies in respect of each of the above and propose a comprehensive strategy for addressing&#13;
them and developing a competent and recognized actuarial profession in Russia. For that purpose, the&#13;
consultant should include a set of specific initiatives identifying where the World Bank could most&#13;
effectively assist. The consultant shall also prepare terms of reference for a broad program aimed at&#13;
establishing actuarial services in the Russian Federation.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
9.            The Ministry of Labor and Social Development will be the main partner in these&#13;
activities. The Ministry will arrange and coordinate interaction with other federal executive bodies&#13;
(Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance), governmental non-budgetary funds (pension, employment,&#13;
social insurance, medical insurance), non-governmental social insurance and pension&#13;
organizations/funds, life insurance companies, public associations of actuaries, Russian educational and&#13;
research institutions, actuarial consulting firms, individual foreign and Russian actuaries.&#13;

ANNEX 1.7 - MONITORING OF PENSIONS DATA&#13;
A. Background&#13;
I .          The expected completion of the Pension Reform Program preparation, including the&#13;
reform concept and a package of draft regulatory legal acts, assumes a quantitative justification of&#13;
actions being developed and, in particular, their cost estimate. However, reliable statistical data on&#13;
demographic and labor characteristics of pensioners required for such estimates are currently non-&#13;
existent. Similarly, the existing statistical report form does not contain necessary data. Individual&#13;
accounts are not used on a universal basis within the state pension system in Russia, which results in the&#13;
lack of ability to obtain representative information on pensioner composition in regions.&#13;
2.           The last selective survey of pensioners was conducted by the USSR Goskomstat in 1998&#13;
and its data cannot be used today due to a qualitative change in the country's socioeconomic conditions.&#13;
A new survey planned for 1997 has not been conducted due to serious financial problems facing the&#13;
Pension Fund whose budgetary resources were supposed to be used for pensioner monitoring. Such&#13;
monitoring is needed to fill the current information gap with respect to quantitative and qualitative&#13;
characteristics of pensioners. The monitoring will be possible by conducting a sociological survey by&#13;
using a selective generalization and analysis of primary documentary data available at regional social&#13;
protection offices to identify social protection measures for pensioners within the framework of the&#13;
reform planned.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
3.           To assist the Ministry of Labor and Social Development and the Pension Fund in:&#13;
(a)    establishing an automated system for the collection, analysis and updating of data on the&#13;
number and composition of pensioners, and&#13;
(b)   conducting a selective sociological survey of pensioners.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
4.           Taking into account the differences in the contents and nature of the above objectives, it&#13;
is expected that the task will be implemented by two Consultants.&#13;

5.    Actions to be taken to implement objective (a) include:&#13;
*  developing a region sampling methodology to monitor pensioner number and composition and&#13;
use it as a basis to select specific regions which would be representative from the viewpoint of&#13;
socio-economic, nature, climatic and demographic indicators;&#13;
*  developing a methodology for sampling indicators included in pensioner files, which are&#13;
required both for predictive and other estimates and justifications within the framework of the&#13;
- pension reform planned, and for efficient operation of MLSD and PF; and&#13;
*  developing software for the collection, generalization, analysis, output and updating of regional&#13;
data on pensioner numbers and composition.&#13;
6.           Actions to be taken to implement objective (b) include:&#13;
*  developing a methodology and constructing a sample of respondents to be surveyed;&#13;
-  developing a survey program, questionnaire and required instructions; and&#13;
*  organizing and conducting a selective survey of pensioners;&#13;
-  preparing an analytical report with recommendation.&#13;

REVENUE COLLECTION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL) is designed to improve&#13;
the poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social protection system. A major part of this process&#13;
is reform of the national pension system and the institutions that finance and operate that system.&#13;
2.           In June 1997, the IMF made a series of recommendations to improve the collection of&#13;
pension contributions.' In July 1997, representatives of the IMF, the PF and the government reached&#13;
agreement on the action plan that will implement these recommendations. As a SPAL conditionality, the&#13;
government has set up a task force to assist in the review the original set of recommendations, to develop&#13;
an action plan for implementing the steps agreed to, and to assure timely execution of that plan. The&#13;
actions agreed to include legal issues which needed to be addressed by the government and&#13;
organizational, procedural, and personnel issues which needed to be addressed by the Pension Fund.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
3.           The objective is to provide the Pension fund with technical and logistical support for the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations agreed to.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;

ANNEX 1.9 - COORDINATION SUPPORT FOR PENSION REFORM&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to review and reform its&#13;
national pension system as part of a general reform of the government's social policy and safety net&#13;
programs. The World Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustment Loan is designed to improve the&#13;
poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social protection system. The reforms involve, inter alia,&#13;
measures to maintain the pension "floor" at a minimum level equal to a percentage of minimum elderly&#13;
subsistence, developing of a concept document on systemic pension reform, and eventually enactment of&#13;
legislation for systemic pension reform. Currently, the government is in the process of initiating the&#13;
legal and regulatory work necessary for the reform. Already, legislation on voluntary pensions is being&#13;
considered by the Federal Assembly.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
2.           In order to facilitate the process of reform, the Government will invite professional&#13;
institutions to undertake several efforts within the framework of the SPAL and the SPIL. It will also&#13;
require professional support of individual consultants in the areas of economics, pension systems, law,&#13;
financial market development, pension modeling etc., to assist in moving the process forward.&#13;

ANNEX 2.1 - SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PILOTS: LOCAL MONITORING AND TRAINING&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Social assistance pilots are to be conducted in three regions to fulfill the conditionality in&#13;
the Social Protection Adjustment Loan -- Komi Republic, Voronezh, and Volgograd oblasts. The&#13;
technical assistance for the pilots are being funded by the Bank-financed Portfolio Development Loan&#13;
and the computerization is being funded by the Employment Services and Social Protection Loan. These&#13;
social assistance pilots are testing approaches to means-testing a new, experimental, extreme poverty&#13;
benefit. The benefit is co-financed by federal and local budgets.&#13;
2.           In Komi, a means-testing methodology called Assessing the Full Economic Potential of&#13;
the Family is being used. In effect, this methodology imputes income from the private plot and other&#13;
household assets which could be used to generate income (e.g. a car). The SOTEKO Institute has been&#13;
developing this for Komi starting in 1996.&#13;
3.           In Voronezh, a combined categorical and income-test is being used. Certain categories&#13;
of people thought to be poor are eligible for the income-test, which will rely on their official income&#13;
(wages and pensions, allowances) plus the imputed value of income from their private plot. The Center&#13;
of the Level of Living Standards (TsUZh) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development has been&#13;
implementing this test since 1992. In Volgograd, a proxy means test will be used in three experimental&#13;
areas, and a Voronezh-style income-test will be used in the latter. The institute responsible for the proxy&#13;
means test is the premier poverty institute in Russia, with a unique tradition of reliable household&#13;
surveys -- Institute of Socio-Economic Studies of the Population (ISEPN) of the Russian Academy of&#13;
Sciences and the MLSD.&#13;
4.           In both Komi and Voronezh, and in the proxy means test areas of Volgograd, a&#13;
household survey, including comprehensive information on consumption for a consumption-based&#13;
poverty profile and a detailed block on social assistance, benefits, and the experimental benefit will be&#13;
carried out before and after the introduction of the pilot benefit, to provide baseline and result data for&#13;
evaluation. To build local capacity, the agency implementing this task is Goskomstat.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           Three specific objectives are envisaged to: (a) build local capacity to monitor the social&#13;
assistance pilots specifically, and more generally, to monitor changes in social welfare needs, demand,&#13;
and utilization; (b) train local personnel in the new pilot methodologies being adopted in each of the&#13;
three pilot oblasts; and (c) track and report all costs, especially administrative costs. Building on the&#13;
excellent working relationships established by three different Russian institutes for developing means-&#13;
testing pilots in the three regions, the Social Assistance Component will provide the necessary financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
for these institutions to conduct training and meaningful self-evaluation. The component will expand the&#13;
ability of these institutions to train and monitor regularly local staff in the means-testing procedure&#13;
piloted in the oblast.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
6.            Three key activities will need to be undertaken: (a) training, (b) monitoring of&#13;
administrative cost and benefit payout procedures as well as provision of consultancy services as needed&#13;
by the local social assistance authorities during implementation of pilot programs, and (c) final report. In&#13;
order for these three institutions to succeed at these tasks, a small investment budget to cover incremental&#13;
capital costs is provided for each:&#13;
7.            Task One - Training. In each oblast, training programs have been initiated to&#13;
familiarize staff with the new procedures for means-testing. In Komi and Voronezh, the methodologies&#13;
being adopted are already somewhat familiar to most staff, but in Volgograd, in the three experimental&#13;
districts, more in-depth training will be required to familiarize staff with the proxy means test&#13;
methodology to be piloted. This will include the provision of detailed written methodological&#13;
instructions on the part of ISEPN staff and extensive training sessions, beyond those planned in Komi or&#13;
Voronezh.&#13;
8.            Task Two - Monitoring Administrative Cost and Benefit Payout Procedures. In each&#13;
region, administrative costs should be carefully monitored, especially in terms of staff time spent on&#13;
training, learning new procedures, and administering client in-take and client assessment. Each institute&#13;
will submit a monitoring plan to track these administrative costs in terms of both money and staff-time.&#13;
Further, each institute will monitor the integrity of the client in-take and assessment procedures. Each&#13;
institute will check a random sample of no less than 10 percent of applicants on a monthly basis to verify&#13;
that correct procedures were followed, and to check that the social worker came to an appropriate&#13;
assessment of client eligibility for the new benefit. All institutes will also provide assistance to local&#13;
social assistance authorities in solving immediate problems arising during the pilot program&#13;
implementation in respective regions.&#13;
9.            Task Three - Final Report Using information available from the monitoring of&#13;
administrative cost and in-take and evaluation procedures and from the beneficiary and participatory&#13;
assessments, each institute will evaluate their experience with means-testing in the given region and will&#13;
present this evaluation in a written report.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
10.          Different duration of assignments are envisaged depending on the actual state of affairs&#13;
in each of the regions.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;

13.          Separate contracts are envisaged with the three key Russian partner institutions: For&#13;
Komi Republic with the SOTEKO company, for Voronezh Oblast with the Center of the Level of Living&#13;
(TsUZh) of the MLSD, and for Volgograd Oblast with the Institute of Socio-Economic Studies of the&#13;
Population (ISEPN) of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the MLSD. These institutes are already&#13;
actively involved in the set-up of the social assistance pilots, and this financing will enable them to&#13;
continue and expand their activities. This work will need to be closely coordinated with that of the&#13;
National Evaluation -- Beneficiary Assessments and Dissemination which will review the work of the&#13;
pilots and make an assessment on best practice examples in each of the three pilot areas.&#13;
14.          Sole-source justiflcation: In each of the three oblasts, the institutes indicated have&#13;
either authorship rights, long experience, or both in working with social assistance in the region. In&#13;
Komi, SOTEKO has been actively developing its methodology for the past three years and the&#13;
government of the Komi Republic has financed a significant portion of the necessary computerization&#13;
already. In Voronezh, TsUZh has been advising on the methodology of means-testing since 1992. In&#13;
Volgograd, the ISEPN is the co-author, along with the Bank of the proxy means test methodology being&#13;
piloted in the three experimental raions and has 30 years experience of excellent poverty work in Russia,&#13;
including independent surveys and evaluations of poverty, in neighboring areas such as Taganrog.&#13;

ANNEX 2.2 - SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PILOTS: NATIONAL EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Social assistance pilots are to be conducted in three regions to fulfill the conditionality in&#13;
the Social Protection Adjustment Loan. The technical assistance for the pilots are being funded by the&#13;
Bank-financed Portfolio Development and the computerization is being funded by the Employment&#13;
Services and Social Protection Loans. The pilots are testing approaches to means-testing a new&#13;
experimental and extreme poverty benefit. The benefit is co-financed by federal and local budgets.&#13;
2.           In Komi, a means-testing methodology called Assessing the Full Economic Potential of&#13;
the Family is being used. In effect, this methodology calculates income from the private plot and other&#13;
household assets which could be used to generate income (e.g. a car). The SOTEKO Institute has been&#13;
implementing this on Komi for the last three years.&#13;
3.           In Voronezh, a combined categorical and income-test is being used. Certain categories&#13;
of people thought to be poor are eligible for the income-test, which calculates their official income&#13;
(wages and pensions, allowances) plus the imputed value of income from their private plot. The Center&#13;
of the Level of Living standards (TsUZh) of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development has been&#13;
implementing this test since 1992. In Volgograd, a proxy means test will be used in three experimental&#13;
areas, and a Voronezh-style income-test will be used in the latter. The institute responsible for the proxy&#13;
means test is the premier poverty institute in Russia, with a unique tradition of reliable household&#13;
surveys -- Institute of Socio-Economic Studies of the Population (ISEPN) of the Russian Academy of&#13;
Sciences and the MLSD.&#13;
4.           In both Komi and Voronezh, and in the proxy means test areas of Volgograd, a&#13;
household survey, which will include comprehensive information on consumption for a consumption-&#13;
based poverty profile and a detailed block on social assistance, benefits, and the experimental benefit&#13;
will be carried out before and after the introduction of the pilot benefit, to provide baseline and result&#13;
data for evaluation. To build local capacity, the agency implementing this task will be Goskomstat.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
5.           The objective of this consultancy is to determine which method of income-testing is the&#13;
most cost-effective and socially acceptable. It also aims at determining which method has the least&#13;
errors of exclusion (the poorest) and of inclusion (payments made to the non-poor).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
6.            Six specific tasks are envisaged:&#13;
(a)    Beneficiary and Participatory Assessments. Beneficiary and participatory assessments&#13;
of recipients of benefits and those denied the benefits will be conduced in collaboration with SOTEKO,&#13;
TsUZh, and ISEPN in Komi, Voronezh, and Volgograd, as well as the local social protection offices. To&#13;
ensure that these assessments are comparable, consultants will participate in the design of each of the&#13;
three local assessments, and will facilitate the synthesis of these findings by the Working Group&#13;
(paragraph 10). The individual or institution selected to undertake the task will: (i) conduct a beneficiary&#13;
assessment of a sample of clients served under the new pilot social assistance benefit, and a participatory&#13;
assessment of a sample of those rejected for the new benefit, and (ii) will evaluate their feedback in each&#13;
of the pilot areas -- Komi and Voronezh Oblasts, three raions of Volgograd, and also for comparison,&#13;
other areas in Volgograd. Collaboration with an international expert or institution in this area is required&#13;
as it is a new approach and requires training and knowledge diffusion to the institutes and localities&#13;
involved;&#13;
(b)    Comparison of Administrative Costs. Capital and recurrent costs need to be quantified&#13;
for the three systems to be tested. Recurrent costs represent an important element; two types of costs&#13;
should be quantified, wages of employees in the social protection offices plus that of social workers.&#13;
Since wages in Russia are much lower than in countries with comparable levels of development, it is&#13;
important that administrative costs be tracked in terms of hours spent on tasks (such as on training,&#13;
service to clients, evaluation, etc.). Calculations should also be made to quantify costs spent from the&#13;
time a client walks into the office to the time the client leaves the office, as well as time spent in&#13;
processing the application, including time spent with clients to inform of results, i.e. eligibility or failure&#13;
to qualify;&#13;
(c)    Poverty Impact of SocialAssistance Pilots. A household budget survey is being&#13;
conducted in Komi, Voronezh, and Volgograd with financing from a PHRD grant. This pilot household&#13;
budget survey will produce a data base with two rounds of information (before and after the introduction&#13;
of the pilot) for each of the three regions. The questionnaire was designed to produce both program&#13;
participation information and household consumption data to enable a consumption-based poverty&#13;
profile to be drawn;&#13;
(d)    Synthesis of Findings and Determination of Best Practices. Based on the completion&#13;
of sub-reports for tasks (a) to (c) above, the coordinating institution and the Working Group will&#13;
synthesize its findings and determine which of the social assistance pilots were best-practice examples in&#13;
each of the three areas, and overall;&#13;
(e)    Comparison of Russian Developments with International Experience. A limited&#13;
number of the Working Group members will further benefit from capacity development through study&#13;
tours to countries with appropriate comparable social policies, including Chile; and&#13;
(f)    Organization of a National Seminar to disseminate results ofpilots. The consultants&#13;
will organize a seminar to be attended by representatives of the oblasts to review the experience under&#13;
the pilots, including which method of means-testing was most successful for inclusion and exclusion.&#13;
They will organize printing/reproduction of reports and conference materials, organization of speakers,&#13;
reproduction of written materials for those who do not attend the seminar, and reproduction of the data&#13;
bases onto diskette by Goskomstat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
7.           It is expected that four different international or Russian individuals will be required&#13;
with responsibilities and experience in: (a) overall evaluation, (b) anthropological/sociological&#13;
experience in beneficiary and participatory assessments, (c) cost accounting, and (d) economic analysis&#13;
of poverty. Of these four, the latter three will require international expertise. It is expected that the&#13;
assignment will require 8-10 months of consultant time and about five months of additional time from a&#13;
local coordinating institute. Since the idea of partnering with the Working Group is to develop the&#13;
capacity of the Working Group to replicate these sorts of evaluations in the future, working knowledge of&#13;
the Russian language will be considered highly desirable.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
8.           The task would require a strong partnership among the Ministries of Economy, Labor&#13;
and Social Development, Goskomstat, the academic community, and consultants experienced in&#13;
evaluation techniques. A working group will be set up on the Russian side, comprising representatives&#13;
of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, Goskomstat, and Russian academic institutions or&#13;
organizations active in the field of social protection. This group will be partnered with international&#13;
experts or institutions with expertise in participatory/beneficiary assessments, in administrative cost&#13;
accounting, and in poverty analysis.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
9.           The consultants will prepare a comprehensive report covering all the points outlined in&#13;
paragraph 6 (a) to (f) above.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
10.          One international or Russian academic institution will be selected to lead a Russian&#13;
Working Group on Evaluation of the Social Assistance Pilots. Other institutions will contribute&#13;
specialists to the Working Group -- MLSD, Goskomstat, the three institutions conducting the pilots&#13;
(SOTEKO, TsUZh, and ISEPN), and the World Bank. The group may also include other Russian&#13;
academic or other international organizations or institutes active in the field of social protection. In the&#13;
case of Russian governmental ministries or organizations, the Russian government will contribute the&#13;
salary costs of staff time who are associated with the task of national evaluation. In the case of&#13;
SOTEKO, TsUZh, and ISEPN, the salary costs of staff time are already included under separate&#13;
contracts.&#13;

ANNEX 2.3 - REVIEW OF SOCIAL BENEFITS, SUBSIDIES, COMPENSATIONS AND PAYMENTS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Recent developments have resulted in the need to optimize the costs involved in&#13;
providing the population with social benefits, subsidies, compensations and cash payments within the&#13;
framework of the social protection of the population. In compliance with the Constitution of the Russian&#13;
Federation, social protection issues are regulated by the joint authority of the Russian Federation and its&#13;
political entities, enabling the latter to develop and enact their own laws governing the conditions under&#13;
which the population may qualify for additional (above Federal quotas) social benefits, subsidies,&#13;
compensations and payments financed from the budgets of Federation's political entities (i.e. oblast&#13;
governments). Local authorities, too, have their own practice of adopting regulations involving the&#13;
financing of various social transfers from local budgets. However, a systematic and continuously&#13;
updated nation-wide database containing information on such regulations, the terms for their application,&#13;
the categories of recipients, the sources and the size of financing, the description of the formation,&#13;
distribution and uses of social transfers at a regional level is currently lacking. This hinders the&#13;
acquisition of true and accurate information on the share of social payments, subsidies, compensations&#13;
and payments in the income distribution of the population, regionally, and the evaluation of integrated&#13;
social costs for the State and their efficiency. Further it makes less accurate estimates of social&#13;
assistance to the regions payable from the Federal budget.&#13;
2.           In the former Ministry of Social Protection, a list of social norms active in individual&#13;
regions was compiled; however this list was far from being exhaustive due to both a limited approach&#13;
practiced by the Ministry and the fact that such information was submitted on a voluntary basis, and&#13;
moreover, the list has become obsolete. The aim is to establish a computerized system for the&#13;
formation, analysis and continuous updating of a database covering the social norms and standards now&#13;
active in the regions of the Russian Federation - not only at a level of the Federation's political entities,&#13;
but at a level of local self-government bodies.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
3.           The objective is to assist the central office of the MLSD in designing a computerized&#13;
system for recording and analysis of political entities' laws and regulations adopted by local authorities&#13;
to provide the population with social benefits, subsidies, compensations, payments and child allowances.&#13;

acquisition in 89 Federation's political entities. Generalization and systematization/classification of the&#13;
thus obtained materials, preparation of respective data bases. Evaluation of the validity of adopted acts&#13;
from the viewpoint of Constitutional norms, and the requirements of applicable Federal law.&#13;
6.           The development and implementation of an industry-oriented mechanism for the&#13;
formation and updating a data base (to be made by Ministry personnel in cooperation with territorial&#13;
labor, employment and social protection agencies and other bodies of executive power).&#13;
7.           The financing of a portion of expenditures involved in the implementation of the first&#13;
stage will be made from the funds of the PDL, with further repayment of the remaining sums from loan&#13;
funds.&#13;
8.           Stage Two. The development of a program for computerized formation, processing and&#13;
updating a data base and its application manual. The setting up at the Ministry of Labor and Social&#13;
Development of three computer work stations for data base specialists, training of the specialists. The&#13;

software on magnetic carriers intended for the specialists of the central office of the Ministry of Labor&#13;
and Social Development and for experts working for territorial labor, employment and social protection&#13;
agencies.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
9.           This assignment is expected to require three months for software development and 18&#13;
months of technical assistance for the remaining activities.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
10.          A research center specializing on social law, which will summarize, systematize the&#13;

ANNEX 3.1 - SOCIAL TRANSFER MONITORING SYSTEM&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Federation is currently lacking a comprehensive picture of financial flows as part of&#13;
the program of state social transfers in terms of sources of financing, transfer channels, conditions and&#13;
categories of recipients either in the country as a whole or regionally. As a result, it is impossible to&#13;
carry out a generalized assessment of corresponding cash flows, i.e. volume of benefits, full and timely&#13;
delivery to the beneficiaries, analysis of whether the resources are used in an appropriate fashion, or&#13;
impact evaluation in terms of population incomes. Findings of specialized checks carried out by&#13;
financial or other supervisory authorities can not make up for this lack of information. Setting up at the&#13;
Ministry of Labor and Social Development of a monitoring system to track state social transfers, would&#13;
make it possible to reduce these deficiencies and to develop an exhaustive financial and statistical data&#13;
base that would be updated on an on-going basis. Such a data base would include data on the number of&#13;
recipients of cash benefits, dynamics of that number, flows of social transfers at various stages both&#13;
across the territory of Russia as a whole, and in individual subjects of the Federation. The system would&#13;
also make corresponding financial flows more transparent.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
2.           The main objective will be to create at the Ministry of Labor and Social Development a&#13;
system of monitoring financial resources allocated at the federal and regional levels in the form of state&#13;
social transfers (pensions, unemployment benefits, child allowances, allowances to poor households).&#13;
The system would serve to assess the terms, conditions and efficiency of the benefits, distribution and&#13;
utilization of such transfers.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
3.           The scope of the work will include:&#13;
(a)    Codification of existing regulatory acts governing the terms and conditions of formation,&#13;
distribution and utilization of state social transfers at the federal and regional levels. Harmonization of&#13;
terms and definitions with the European integrated system S-PROS for subsequent consistency of social&#13;
protection accounts. Analysis of the forms of financial and statistical reporting reflecting corresponding&#13;
financial flows (state and sectoral reporting) at the federal and regional levels. Implementation of&#13;
selective surveys in a number of subjects of the Russian Federation (2-3 republics, oblasts, or krais).&#13;
Collection of centrally and regionally available financial and statistical data;&#13;

(f)    Development and submission of legal regulatory acts providing for formal adoption of&#13;
the system to monitor social transfers;&#13;
(g)    Procurement, installation and operation of hardware and software resources required for&#13;
the purposes of monitoring social transfers;&#13;
(h)    Development and circulation of instructions and methodologies related to the&#13;
establishment of a monitoring function to track social transfers to regions; and&#13;
(i)    Implementation of selective surveys and evaluations of viability and reliability of&#13;
operations of the monitoring system.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;

E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
5.            The assignment will need to be undertaken by a team of multi-disciplinary experts,&#13;
including specialists from labor, employment, and social protection offices both from MLSD and from&#13;
the selected localities. The work of the local experts will need to be complemented by support from&#13;
consultants in areas of development of software and installation of hardware.&#13;

ANNEX 3.2 - NATIONAL SURVEY OF HOUSEHOLD WELFARE AND PROGRAM PARTICIPATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           A Poverty Assessment was undertaken for Russia in 1995, and updated a year later using&#13;
more recent data from a nationally representative household survey and other research. The poverty&#13;
assessment followed a social sector review completed in 1994. The findings of these reports were basic&#13;
inputs to the design of the SPAL, assisting in focusing the conditionality on interventions that targeted&#13;
the poor and vulnerable, and also addressing administrative and systemic problems.&#13;
2.           Based on four rounds of the household survey carried out between mid-1992 and the end&#13;
of 1995, it is clear that the overall level of poverty has fluctuated since 1992. In 1992, the poverty&#13;
headcount for households was around 25%. This rose to almost 32% in 1993, before falling again to&#13;
27% in 1994. However, there was another sharp increase in 1995, with the headcount by the end of the&#13;
year up to 35%. Other surveys show broadly similar results but the official numbers from Goskomstat&#13;
have recently shown slightly lower headcounts. The rate of severe poverty (defined as those with&#13;
expenditure less than 50% of the household specific poverty line) has also fluctuated, and was around&#13;
11% at the end of 1995. Due to the larger average size of poor households, this results in around 41% of&#13;
individuals living in poverty.&#13;
3.           It has been consistently fond that the poorest groups in Russia are households with&#13;
children, and those with an unemployed household member. This pattern has in fact become more&#13;
pronounced over time as poverty rates among these groups have risen faster than those for the general&#13;
population. By the end of 1995, households with children under 18 years old had a poverty rate almost&#13;
50% higher than the general population, and those with even one unemployed member bad poverty&#13;
headcounts more than 15 points above the national average. In contrast, households with pensioners&#13;
have not been found to have high poverty rates on average, a finding which is consistent with poverty&#13;
assessments throughout the FSU. The reasons for this include the better retention of the real value of&#13;
pensions relative to wages, the incidence of pensioners who both work and receive full pensions, and the&#13;
larger stock of assets owned by pensioners at the start of the transition. However, there are sub-groups of&#13;
pensioners who are very poor, particularly those living alone, who are predominantly women.&#13;
4.           Another important finding from the time series data is that there is high mobility in an&#13;
out of poverty, suggesting that many poor households are poor due to income shocks which they are&#13;
often able to overcome in time.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           The objective of the survey is to prepare a nationally and regionally representative&#13;
survey of household welfare and progran participation (NOBUS) that would allow to systematically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
obtain annual data on household income and their involvement in local and national social protection&#13;
programs.&#13;
6.           The Survey would make it possible to measure the efficiency of benefits for the&#13;
recipients and be used for the analysis of local and national benefit recipients to determine the poverty&#13;
level of the latter. The Survey would be accompanied by a national survey of household consumption&#13;
and expenditures whose components would be intensively supported under the Bureau of Economic&#13;
Analysis Project and which, in itself, does not assume the collection of detailed information on&#13;
household income and participation in local social protection programs.&#13;
7.           The NOBUS would be a follow-up of the PHRD-financed pilot survey conducted in&#13;
three pilot regions which receive special assistance (Komi Republic, Voronezh and Volgograd Oblasts).&#13;
The results will be used to finalize a specialized social assistance questionnaire and prepare a new&#13;
nationally and regionally representative sample. It is assumed that a comprehensive regional coverage is&#13;
not a prerequisite of the Survey since the social program efficiency would be considered on a nation-&#13;
wide scale.&#13;
8.           The Survey program which contains detailed data on household composition and&#13;
employment can be complemented by various specialized modules to facilitate a better understanding of&#13;
poverty in Russia. That would help create a national potential to monitor poverty level and scope and the&#13;
efficiency of poverty reduction interventions. In addition, combining the NOBUS data with the survey&#13;
of household consumption and expenditures (which also contains a life standard indicator block) into a&#13;
single component would allow a multidimensional approach to measuring poverty in Russia.&#13;
9.           The NOBUS is a logical and natural follow-up of a pilot survey of social assistance&#13;
efficiency and many other activities carried out by the World Bank in a close cooperation with&#13;
Goskomstat. The Social Protection Component will enable the Goskomstat to follow poverty and&#13;
household program participation trends not only at the national level, but also at the level of the subjects&#13;
of the Federation. Therefore, the component plays an important role in obtaining latitudionally and&#13;
longitudinally significant information on the status of the social protection system.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
10.          The objective of the component is to create a national capacity for monitoring local&#13;
trends in social welfare and household program participation. Goskomstat will be the implementing&#13;
agency while its local divisions in the Oblasts and other subjects of the Federation will also participate as&#13;
indirect participants. The following is a list of activities which will require international experience&#13;
(a)    Sample preparation. Goskomstat, together with an intemnational sampling expert&#13;
(experts), shall prepare a nationally and regionally representative sample. Since the sample should be&#13;
representative of 46 subjects of the Federation, it will be much larger than the one designed for the&#13;
national level only, which has important implications for computerization and operating expenditures&#13;
(number of interviews). Besides, to obtain required information on the level of social program&#13;
participation it might be necessary to extend the sample, including more households with a lower income&#13;
level, since households with a higher income distribution rank are not likely to participate in such&#13;
programs. Therefore, it is critical to establish cooperation with international sampling experts or&#13;
bilateral counterparts in the field of statistical methodology;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
(b)    Development of the questionnaire. The questionnaire should be based on experience&#13;
gained from the pilot social assistance surveys. Goskomstat would review the questionnaire in&#13;
consultation with survey experts from the World Bank and other institutions;&#13;
(c).   Training of interviewers. Well-trained interviewers are critical for a successful&#13;
implementation of any survey, but they are especially important for a survey such as the NOBUS which&#13;
involves issues that are often touchy for respondents (e.g., participation in welfare programs, reception of&#13;
charity assistance from public or private sources, etc.) and might include respondents who are not&#13;
inclined to give exhaustive answers (if the emphasis is made on low-income households);&#13;
(d)   Data input program and data processing procedures. Any survey requires a data input&#13;
program and operators to enter the data, which is associated with program development and operator&#13;
training costs. Based on lessons learned from the survey conducted under the Bureau of Economic&#13;
Analysis Project, the Survey of Household Welfare and Program Participation will employ the same&#13;
principles of decentralized data input which are inevitably connected with the field work. In practice, that&#13;
would mean high capital costs at the initial stage since it will be necessary to adequately equip offices in&#13;
each of 46 subjects of the Federation. Besides, it would mean significant operating costs since it will be&#13;
necessary to process numerous and complex data at every NOBUS round.&#13;
(e)    Data dissemination. Surveys like the NOBUS produces a comprehensive set of data for&#13;
analysis. In compliance with the established procedures, Goskomstat would prepare and disseminate an&#13;
abstract containing identifiers and statistical summaries for all NOBUS rounds, as well as data proper&#13;
(without any references to specific households). Easy accessibility of these data to general public and&#13;
especially to academic circles is essential for the analysis of the governmental poverty reduction and&#13;
welfare policy. Upon request, the Goskomstat would submit data on diskettes at the nominal cost of data&#13;
reproduction on that medium. The funds to be allocated for this component of the NOBUS would be&#13;
partially used to cover respective administrative costs since the demand for the data is expected to be&#13;
high. Besides, it is necessary to provide for local dissemination of regional data.&#13;
(f)    Analysis. Goskomstat, in collaboration with academic circles, should envisage an&#13;
additional analysis of welfare and program participation data and regional trends. This component&#13;
provides for partial funding of staff at the Goskomstat headquarters, as well as additional funding of&#13;
scientists from local academic circles and other governmental institutions to be engaged by the&#13;
Goskomstat in data and problem analysis.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
11.          This assignment will require about 3 months of technical assistance on sample design&#13;
and software design for the survey. In addition, the project will cover the costs incurred to carry out the&#13;
survey including payment to contractual interviewers, travel expenses, training, and data processing and&#13;
cleaning.&#13;
E. Experience and qualifications&#13;
12.          The assignment will require a multi-disciplinary team including experts in sample and&#13;
questionnaire design, training of interviewers and supervisors, data entry, analysis, and dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. Expected Outputs&#13;
13.         Goskomstat will design and implement the proposed survey three times over a three year&#13;
period.&#13;

ANNEX 3.3 - ANALYSIS OF POVERTY DATA&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           As of today, the share of households with current money income below the subsistence&#13;
level is a major statistical indicator reflecting poverty dynamics in Russia. At the same time, modem&#13;
poverty research employs an approach whereby an individual or a household is considered poor if the&#13;
total available (including in-kind) resources do not allow unrestricted participation in the life of&#13;
community or circle they belong to.&#13;
2.           Based on that approach, poverty shall be considered in the context of relative deprivation&#13;
that results in an eventual (social) exclusion of individuals from community which makes them incapable&#13;
of leading normal lives. In that case, poverty level assessment shall take into account all components of&#13;
the household economic potential, including not only current money income, but also available savings&#13;
and physical assets such as property.&#13;
3.           Under conditions of a transition period crisis, in-kind physical assets become household&#13;
strategic resources which can facilitate their successful adaptation to the new macroeconomic&#13;
environment. A broad interpretation of socioeconomic differentiation (which takes into account not only&#13;
income, but also other physical assets of households) can add a more realistic touch both to the entire&#13;
picture of current stratification of Russian households by welfare and the established conception of the&#13;
life standard of large socio-demographic groups and their place in the new social hierarchy, which is&#13;
based on the analysis of current money income6.&#13;
4.           Based on the National Survey of Household Welfare and Program Participation&#13;
(NOBUS) to be conducted by Goskomstat, it would be possible to evaluate the poverty scale in Russia by&#13;
analyzing relative deprivation criteria and "social exclusion" (i.e. exclusion from normal social life)&#13;
indicators.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           To develop a methodology and carry out analysis to improve the understanding of the&#13;
role of income in social exclusion processes, as well as the role of in-kind indicators in the assessment of&#13;
poverty level and scope in Russia.&#13;

6.           Analysis of the survey. Based on the latest achievements in the field of&#13;
multidimensional poverty measurements and in collaboration with established leading experts in that&#13;
sphere, it would be necessary to develop a methodology for constructing a deprivation index and&#13;
designing a "social exclusion scale".&#13;
7.           These integral measures would form the basis for analyzing poverty level and scope, and&#13;
the results of the analysis would be included in the annual report to the Government "Welfare and&#13;
Poverty in Russia". These results could be used to develop recommendations on strengthening the target&#13;
social policy actions.&#13;

prepare a preliminary report outlining major trends of the future analysis.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;

ANNEX 3.4 - REVIEW OF PROGRAMS AIMED AT VULNERABLE GROUPS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Government is undertaking a comprehensive structural adjustment of the social&#13;
sector, including federal and regional transfers both in cash and kind. The main goal of the adjustment is&#13;
to make the overall transfer system more efficient and effective and more targeted towards the vulnerable&#13;
groups of the population, particularly the poor. In order to enable the Russian Government to design new&#13;
social policy, a comprehensive research is needed. This particularly refers to the most vulnerable groups&#13;
of the population such as orphans (those in institutions, under guardianship and under foster care),&#13;
children from dysfunctional families, mentally and physically handicapped children, adults and the&#13;
elderly, elderly people not able to support and take care of themselves, homeless and other vulnerable&#13;
groups.&#13;
2.           Redefinition of public policies and programs aimed at protection of particularly&#13;
vulnerable children, handicapped, homeless and similar groups of the population requires a&#13;
comprehensive review and analysis of currently existing policies and programs, with special focus on&#13;
their efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, a detailed review and analysis of private programs, which&#13;
have emerged during the last several years as part of civic initiatives and activities, and which are&#13;
targeted towards those vulnerable groups of the population is needed.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
3.           The objectives of the review and evaluation of programns is to: (i) review, analyze and&#13;
evaluate present public and private policies and programs; (ii) identify their weaknesses and advantages;&#13;
and (iii) propose improvements, changes and new policies and programs.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
4.           Task One - Review of the existing public policies and programs. All existing policies&#13;
and programs at the national and regional level aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups of the&#13;
population will be carefully reviewed and analyzed, with particular focus on legal provision and&#13;
programs and policies administration and implementation. The review will include public policies and&#13;
programs aimed at: (i) orphans for any reason (institutionalized children, children under guardianship&#13;
and those under foster care). (ii) children from dysfunctional families; (iii) mentally and physically&#13;
handicapped children, adults and the elderly; (iv) elderly people, not able to support and take care of&#13;
themselves and with no relatives to take care of them; (v) homeless; (vi) other similar groups. Adoption&#13;
and foster care policies should be carefully reviewed, discussed, and evaluated. All such policies and&#13;
programs will be compared with similar programs and practices in other countries, particularly in&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
5.           Task Two - Review and evaluation ofprivate programs. Private programs and&#13;
initiatives targeted towards the most vulnerable groups of the population at the national and regional&#13;
levels will be reviewed, analyzed and evaluated. Both national and international private programs will&#13;
be included (NGOs, church, charities, etc.). Their importance and capability to supplement the public&#13;
programs will be assessed.&#13;
6.           Task Three - Situation analysis. The situation analysis will provide a comprehensive&#13;
and detailed information of the present social and economic position of the most vulnerable groups of the&#13;
population. Detailed data should be collected, particularly: number of the vulnerable in each group, their&#13;
age and gender structure, structure by type of care, type of programs, etc., number of public institutions&#13;
providing services to the most vulnerable with detailed information on their staff, etc. Problems should&#13;
be identified and thoroughly discussed. Resources allocated to those programs (revenues and&#13;
expenditures) should be reviewed and analyzed. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis will be&#13;
done.&#13;
7.           Task Four - Evaluation ofpolicies andprograms. Each program should be evaluated on&#13;
the basis of its: appropriateness, the scope of protection it really provides and its efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness. Different programs aimed at the same group will be comparatively analyzed.&#13;
8.           Task Five - Recommendations. Improvements, changes and new policies and programs&#13;
should be recommended and well documented. The consultant will provide a detailed project proposal&#13;
and project outline with description of the methodology to be used.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;

ANNEX 3.5 - ANALYSIS AND MONITORING OF NUTRITION DATA&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           During recent years health conditions of the population worsened in many aspects: low&#13;
weights, particularly among children, gastro-enteric problems and diseases are spreading. This results&#13;
from deterioration of living standards of the population and from poverty. At the same time there is no&#13;
system in Russia, which would allow monitoring malnutrition among children. In addition, standard&#13;
statistical surveys are not sufficient to determine nutrition level of food consumed by households. As a&#13;
result, there is no opportunity to learn causes, scale and characteristics of malnutrition or to assess&#13;
correlation of malnutrition and poverty.&#13;

ANNEX 4.1 - CHILD ALLOWANCE PILOTS: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           As part of the overall structural adjustment of the social sector, the Government is taking&#13;
steps to transfer from enterprises the responsibility of the payment of social transfers. Specifically,&#13;
enterprises have been administering the payment of family and child allowances. However, the transition&#13;
process has put on the agenda a need to separate social functions from enterprises, transfer them to the&#13;
state administration (social assistance offices) in order to increase their efficiency and effectiveness and&#13;
enable regional governments, as well as the Federal government to monitor the flow of transfers,&#13;
evaluate the policy and adjust it to the changing needs of the population.&#13;
2.           Samara Oblast has been conducting an experiment in transferring child allowance&#13;
payments from enterprises to local social assistance offices and several regions have already taken steps&#13;
to follow Samara's example or are preparing to do the same. In addition, a national conference to review&#13;
the experience in Samara was organized by MLSD in May 1997. The Government would like to support&#13;
the process of the transfer of child allowances payments from enterprises to local social assistance&#13;
offices as well as to build the capacity in local social assistance offices to administer child allowance&#13;
payments efficiently and effectively. Six regions have agreed to begin implementation of the transfer to&#13;
local social assistance offices, one of these oblasts will also participate in the social assistance pilots&#13;
being implemented by MLSD. These regions are: Belgorod, Kaluga, Moscow Novgorod, Volgograd&#13;
oblasts and Udmurtia Republic.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
3.           The objective is to provide an integrated technical assistance package for the oblasts to&#13;
assist them in the transfer of payments to the local social assistance offices. This technical assistance&#13;
will include: (i) designing procedures necessary to implement child allowance administration; (ii)&#13;
designing a software application which addresses the computerization requirements of the administration&#13;
developed; (iii) training to local social workers and regional social affairs administration officials who&#13;
will administer child allowances; (iv) develop public information for the population; (v) develop national&#13;
guidelines for transfer of child allowance payments from enterprises to local social assistance offices;&#13;
and (vi) dissemination of results.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
4.           Task One - Design and implement procedures and administration guidelines. The&#13;
consultant will design a system for local social assistance offices to administer the child allowance&#13;
payments cost-effectively and efficiently. This system will include procedures for registration of&#13;
applicants, eligibility deternination and processing of payments. Systems will also need to be designed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
for record keeping on applicants and beneficiaries, accounting of revenues and payments and statistics on&#13;
payments, arrears, types of beneficiaries. In conjunction with the software development, the consultant&#13;
will design necessary documents and forms. Once designed, the consultant will assist in the&#13;
implementation of the procedures in the six participating regions.&#13;
5.           Task Two - Software development. A software application is needed for several aspects&#13;
of the system for child allowance administration. This will include record keeping on child allowance&#13;
applicants and beneficiaries, benefit calculation, benefit payments, and accounting. The software should&#13;
be constructed in such way, so as that it can be easily adjusted to allow for regional differences and must&#13;
be compatible with the software being used for other areas of benefit administration (i.e. pensions and&#13;
social assistance). It is envisaged that the software development will undergo several stages including&#13;
analysis of current system and the experience in Samara, system design, programming, testing,&#13;
acceptance of system, pilot run of software in one area (possible raion) with data entry, modification and&#13;
acceptance for implementation. Manuals and instructions will be written and will accompany the&#13;
software for training and implementation. The consultant will work in close cooperation with regional&#13;
social assistance administrations in participating regions, with the Federal MLSD, the MLSD's&#13;
information technology group and with the proposed working group of MLSD. The working group will&#13;
be responsible for final approval of the software. This task could be subcontracted by the consultant if&#13;
they are unable to design the necessary software.&#13;
6.            Task Three - Training. In each participating region the consultant will organize training&#13;
sessions for local social workers and regional social administration officials dealing with child&#13;
allowances. This training will include all aspects of the child allowance administration including the&#13;
administration, systems and procedures described above as well as training on the use of computers and&#13;
the software application. It will be necessary to provide basic computer training to some workers before&#13;
they are able to be trained in the application of the designed software. T'he experience in Samara should&#13;
serve as a basis for training. This training may be organized at the oblast level or the consultant may&#13;
conduct several training sessions for workers from groups of raions. This training will need to be&#13;
coordinated with the delivery of computer hardware to be purchased.&#13;
7.            Task Four - Public Information. The consultant will design necessary public&#13;
information measures to alert the population of the change in child allowance administration. It is&#13;
necessary to communicate to the public these changes in order for them to collect payments from the&#13;
social assistance offices instead of their employer. The information dissemination could be in the form&#13;
of brochures delivered to homes by post, radio announcements, outdoor advertising/announcements,&#13;
newspaper. The consultant will be responsible for all aspects of this dissemination.&#13;
8.           Task Five - Monitoring. The consultant will monitor the implementation of the child&#13;
allowances through the social assistance offices. This will include checking to ensure that guidelines are&#13;
being followed, resolving problems, making alterations if necessary for regional differences, site visits&#13;
and a system to track down recipients.&#13;
9.            Task Six - Guidelinesfor transfer of CA payment The consultant will use the system&#13;
designed as a basis for developing national guidelines for the transfer and administration of child&#13;
allowance payments. The guidelines should include steps to be undertaken, procedures to be followed,&#13;
samples of necessary documents and forms. The consultant will closely cooperate with regional social&#13;
assistance administrations in participating regions, with the Federal MLSD and with the proposed&#13;
working group of MLSD. The working group will be responsible for final approval of the national&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
&#13;

10.           Task Seven - Dissemination of results. During the course of implementation it will be&#13;
necessary to disseminate to results to other oblasts which will be beginning the process of transferring&#13;
administration of payments to local social assistance offices. The consultant should assess the results of&#13;
the transfer in the six participating regions as well as the advanced experience in Samara. Dissemination&#13;
of these results should take place through a national conference for oblast administrations and the&#13;

ANNEX 5.1 - AMENDMENTS TO EMPLOYMENT LAW&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           With transition, unemployment has become more widespread, and in 1996 there was an&#13;
estimated 6 million unemployed (ILO definition) in Russia, of whom 2.6 million were officially&#13;
registered job seekers, 2.3 million had a status of unemployed and about 2 million were receiving&#13;
benefits. The number of unemployed is increasing, and as enterprises are expected to increasingly resort&#13;
to labor shedding, unemployment may increase even further and put significant pressures on the system&#13;
of unemployment benefits and employment services. At the same time, marked regional differences in&#13;
economic activity and employment require an effective equalization mechanism to ensure the adequate&#13;
payment of benefits and provision of employment services in needy regions.&#13;
2.           Unemployment benefits and active labor market programs (counseling, assessment,&#13;
placement, information, temporary schemes) are paid out of the Employment Fund (EF), an extra-&#13;
budgetary fund managed by the Federal Employment Service in the Ministry of Labor and Social&#13;
Development. In 1996, 28% of EF revenues were spent on payment of unemployment benefits. The&#13;
bulk (80%) of revenues are retained at local levels. The remainder goes to the center for redistribution to&#13;
employment offices that are in deficit. Currently, only 10 regional employment offices are in surplus.&#13;
The centralized portion of EF revenues is insufficient to adequately meet requirements of deficit regions&#13;
beyond providing benefit payments. Moreover, the redistribution mechanism is inadequate and does not&#13;
appear to favor the poorest of the deficit regions.&#13;
3.           The Government intends to propose centralization of a larger share of the EF resources&#13;
for redistribution; at the same time, it intends to improve the redistribution mechanism to better&#13;
emphasize poorer regions and make it transparent. Changing the centralized amounts requires approval&#13;
by the Federal Assembly, and the Government is seeking assistance to establish a case for greater&#13;
centralization.&#13;
4.           The Government also intends to introduce amendments to the Employment Law that aim&#13;
at greater efficiency in the use of EF resources and at improving reinsertion incentives and the&#13;
reinsertion function of the unemployment benefit program. In particular, the Government is aiming at a&#13;
reduction of the replacement rate, at shortening the period of payment of unemployment benefits for&#13;
certain categories, and introducing stricter eligibility requirements for benefit receipt. At the same time,&#13;
the Government is increasing the minimum benefit, which currently is only some 12% of subsistence&#13;
minimum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           The objective of the consultancy would be three-fold: (i) to develop justification for&#13;
greater centralization of EF resources; (ii) develop a transparent redistribution mechanism that would&#13;
give greater weight to needier regions; and (iii) assess the labor market implications of the proposed&#13;
changes in the labor law and the minimum benefit.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
6.           The consultant would, in collaboration with the relevant entities in the Ministry of Labor&#13;
and Social Development (MLSD), and drawing on the work already done by the Institute of Economics&#13;
and Sociology to estimate the centralization needs for equalization of benefit payments, to determine the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) assess the overall financial needs for unemployment benefits and active labor market&#13;
programs based on different scenarios for unemployment and reinsertion;&#13;
(b) project EF revenues under various scenarios of employment growth, collections, and wage&#13;
growth;&#13;
(c) on the basis of such analysis, determine regional surplus and deficit situations;&#13;
(d) determine the financial scope for benefit and program delivery, and make recommendations&#13;
about relative priorities for EF expenditures, distinguishing between programs; and surplus and deficit&#13;
regions;&#13;
(e) on the basis of the above analysis, make recommendations about (i) the extent of&#13;
centralization of EF resources; (ii) their use for various programs in surplus and deficit regions; and (iii)&#13;
draft legislation to regulate the use of EF funds;&#13;
(f) develop a transparent redistribution formula based on indicators of regional need: and&#13;
(g) undertake an analysis of the effects (the incentives created) of the changes in the&#13;
employment law.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
7.           This assignment is estimated to require ten weeks&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
8.           The consultant should: (a) be trained in economics and financial analysis, including&#13;
econometric techniques, and have extensive experience in their application; (b) have a strong&#13;
understanding of unemployment assistance mechanisms (benefit provision, active labor market&#13;
services), preferably with experience in the planning and design of benefit and reinsertion prograns; and&#13;
(c) knowledge of OECD country employment programs.&#13;
F. Outputs&#13;

ANNEX 5.2 - DRAFT OF NEW LABOR CODE&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Since the early 1990s, radical changes have occurred in the Russian economy aimed, in&#13;
particular, at establishing market-based relations in the labor sphere. However, the basic legislative act&#13;
on labor relations -- the Labor Code -- was approved over twenty five years ago and is completely&#13;
outdated. Only a few insignificant changes were implemented in the Code in recent years and thus&#13;
market-oriented labor reforms have a very weak legislative basis. New labor laws adopted in 1992-1996,&#13;
(such as On Collective Agreements, On Order of Settlements of Collective Disputes, On Trade Unions,&#13;
On Employment), mostly regulate industrial relations or social protection of the unemployed. The&#13;
framework for labor relations -- regulation of the individual labor contract -- has not been revised since&#13;
the Soviet period. Such a situation has several negative consequences especially for workers. Employers&#13;
often avoid concluding labor contracts and try to substitute temporary, short-term or informal labor&#13;
commitments. Employers pay a significant share of remuneration in concealed ways to avoid high&#13;
payroll taxes. Wage arrears have reached mammoth proportions currently exceeding two percent of&#13;
GDP annually. Workers have no legal protection against such injustice. In such an unregulated labor&#13;
market, many workers are forced to accept such arrangements in order to keep their jobs. Unregulated&#13;
labor relations are directly related to the large number of workers on administrative leave or working&#13;
reduced hours. More than 40 percent of such workers are not compensated at all. In turn, the high level&#13;
of labor hoarding is directly related to the slow pace of enterprise restructuring.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
2.           The foundation of the labor law in Russia -- the Labor Code --needs major reform.&#13;
Issues to be regulated are the labor contract, including hiring and firing regulations; remuneration,&#13;
including payment guarantees in case of firings and layoffs; and other fundamental labor issues and&#13;
regulations between the employer and worker. The new Labor Code should establish linkage with other&#13;
labor laws and regulations, such as those on industrial relations, and with laws on the social protection of&#13;
workers, the unemployed and their families.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
3.           The activities of the project include the following:&#13;
(a)   review the current labor and social legislation, including laws adopted in the Soviet&#13;
period and in the 1990s;&#13;
(b)    draft new Labor Code;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
(c)    draft a law on individual labor contracts -- the most urgent subject in this field; and&#13;
(d)   to organize a national conference for public discussion and information.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
4.           Up to 40 person months of local experts on labor law from the Institute of Labor and&#13;
other institutions will be invited to join an expert group organized by the MLSD, and will be the main&#13;
body which will prepare the draft laws and the Labor Code. Up to four person months of foreign&#13;
individual experts will be sought in the fields of labor legislation and regulation. A national conference&#13;
will be organized and publications will be prepared on the new recommendations.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualifications&#13;
5.           Expertise and practice in Russian and or international labor law, regulation, and labor&#13;
practices of at least 5 years is required. Fluency in Russian for international experts is desirable but not&#13;
required.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
6.           The output of the technical project will be the draft of a new Labor Code and draft(s) of&#13;
several other legislative acts on labor relations. A national conference will be organized to disseminate&#13;
findings.&#13;
G. Institutional arrangements&#13;
7.           The Ministry of Labor and Social Development will oversee the effort. Assistance in the&#13;

ANNEX 5.3 - REVIEW OF PUBLIC WORKS SCHEMES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           With transition, the labor market situation in the Russian Federation has become&#13;
difficult. In 1996, there was an estimated six million unemployed (ILO definition), of whom 2.3 million&#13;
were officially registered job-seekers. The problem is to provide the unemployed with temporary jobs&#13;
during job search, and the organization of public works schemes. Current employment legislation&#13;
contains clauses regulating public works, and implementation of public works schemes is one of the&#13;
responsibilities of the Federal Employment Service (FES). According to FES data, some 300-500,000&#13;
people annually participate in public works schemes. Recently, the number has been decreasing - some&#13;
290,000 participated in 1996, or 83% of the previous years' level. In subsidized regions, the number is&#13;
dropping even faster. For instance, in Tomskaya oblast, the number of public works participants in 1996&#13;
decreased by 28%, in Kostromskaya oblast by 37%, in Ivanovskayya oblast by 35%. At the same time,&#13;
public works schemes were successfully functioning in Orenburgskaya oblast (230%), Yaroslavskaya&#13;
oblast (137%), Nizhegorodskaya oblast (130%), Mordovia republic (149%). This situation is determined&#13;
by the fact that currently all measures related to public works organization and funding are done by&#13;
regional employment services. Due to a lack of funding in many regions, the programs are funded on the&#13;
basis of mutual settlements between employment services and EF contributors (enterprises). With an&#13;
increasingly difficult fiscal situation, it is expected that difficulties of program implementation will&#13;
increase.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
2.           The study would asses the experience with labor-intensive public works schemes, their&#13;
employment and asset creating ability and consequently their short- and long term impact on the local&#13;
economy; and it would recommend best-practice guidelines that can be factored into policies designed to&#13;
improve the cost-effectiveness of public works programs.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
3.           The consultant will document the experience of selected public works programs. The&#13;
sample should be drawn from well-off, poor, and very poor regions. To assess their employment and&#13;
asset creating ability, the programs should be divided into three categories: directly productive projects;&#13;
economic infrastructure projects; and social infrastructure projects.&#13;
4.           The consultant will review project selection procedures, targeting, labor contracting and&#13;
wage setting, management and organization of works, maintenance strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
5.            The consultant will determine the correlation between program objectives and design;&#13;
skills development and income distribution effects of programs; long-term employment and income&#13;
creation effects; and costs and benefits of different programs.&#13;
6.            The consultant will recommend best practice guidelines that are likely to lead to cost-&#13;
effective programs; and structured evaluation response procedures.&#13;
7.           The consultant will review current legislation, regulations and policies on public works&#13;
and indicate changes that may be necessary as a result of the recommendations.&#13;

issues in FSU and/or CE countries. Russian language skills would be desirable.&#13;
F. Expected outputs&#13;
10.          The review is expected to produce the following outcomes to be recorded in a report: (i)&#13;
a better understanding of transitional job creation in Russia, its impact on beneficiaries and local labor&#13;
markets and costs and financing; and (ii) recommendations on policy changes and guidelines for&#13;

ANNEX 5.4 - MONITORING OF LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to reform the Government's&#13;
social policy and safety net programs. The World Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SPAL) aims at improving the poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social protection system. In&#13;
the area of employment and labor markets the reforms will improve the effectiveness of the system of&#13;
unemployment benefits and the efficiency of use of the Employment Fund for benefit payments and the&#13;
financing of active labor market programs.&#13;
2.           Since the beginning of transition, unemployment has emerged as an important social&#13;
issue, and registered job seekers amounted to 2.6 million (1996). At the same time, short-time&#13;
arrangements and administrative leave are widespread, and increasing numbers of workers are moving&#13;
into the informal sector (an estimated 16% of the labor force in 1996). Unemployment benefits are set as&#13;
a share of previous earnings, initially at 75%, and declining to 45% over a twelve month period.&#13;
Eligibility depends on satisfying an earnings requirement (26 weeks in the previous year). People with&#13;
shorter work history or no work history receive a minimum benefit equal to the minimum wage. Actual&#13;
benefits are low: currently, the average unemployment benefit is about 80% of minimum subsistence,&#13;
and the minimum benefit is less than 20% of minimum subsistence. These benefit levels are insufficient&#13;
to serve effectively either as a buffer against poverty or as a means to facilitate job search and take&#13;
advantage of active labor market programs. The requirements of the Government's stabilization program&#13;
will not allow substantial increases in benefit levels. Benefits are paid out of the Employment Fund&#13;
(EF), an extra-budgetary fund managed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD).&#13;
3.           The Government is envisaging a number of measures to improve the efficiency of&#13;
benefit provision, including revision of the replacement rate, reduction of the duration of benefit&#13;
payments in certain instances, and restrictions on eligibility. It also intends to introduce an annual&#13;
financial review of the operations of the Employment Fund. With the introduction of such new&#13;
measures, the Government intends to undertake a number of consultancies to (I) improve monitoring the&#13;
labor market, including reviewing the impact of changes in benefits and benefit provision on&#13;
beneficiaries; and (ii) undertake a financial review of the EF.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;

C. Job Description&#13;
5.           In afirst phase, the consultant will review current labor market information and data,&#13;
including labor market, establishment, household surveys, tracer studies, etc. He/she will determine how&#13;
well available information transmits labor market signals (labor force activities, wage and employment&#13;
trends) and provides information about the balance of skills demand and supply (as contrasted with&#13;
manpower requirements forecasting) in order to: (I) inform public and private training and employment&#13;
decisions; and (ii) discern labor market imperfections and failures for the purposes of influencing market&#13;
reforms.&#13;
6.           The consultant will make recommendations about (i) improvements in labor market&#13;
statistics and information to allow analysis and dissemination of informnation on the balance of skills&#13;
demand and supply, which will guide active labor market programs, and meet training information needs&#13;
of individuals, employers and training institutions; and (ii) the introduction of training and employment&#13;
observatories aimed at information processing, and understanding and applying labor market signals as&#13;
generated by the information. He/she will also determine eventual training needs of public sector users -&#13;
- at central and regional policymaking levels and in local employment services.&#13;

ANNEX 5.5 - MONITORING CONDITIONS OF THE UNEMPLOYED&#13;
A. Background&#13;
I.           Unemployment is a major emerging social issue, and unemployment benefits represent&#13;
one of the most important public social programs available to unemployed individuals under current&#13;
legislation. However, the current macroeconomic environment and financial and fiscal constraints have&#13;
reduced the unemployment benefit to the extent that it effectively loses its function of supporting&#13;
subsistence of the unemployed. Today the average amount of the unemployment benefit stands at about&#13;
80% of the subsistence income. The situation becomes even more dramatic for people who receive&#13;
unemployment benefits equal to the minimum wage, which amounts to less than 20% of the subsistence&#13;
income of able-bodied population. If unemployment benefits are indeed the only source of subsistence,&#13;
this means that the recipient automatically enters absolute poverty. At the same time, the rates of benefits&#13;
assigned to the newly unemployed are very liberal: the replacement schedule (75%-60%-45%) is very&#13;
high even by international standards. This requires a review and, possibly, compression of the&#13;
replacement schedule.&#13;
2.           In connection with this problem the Government of the Russian Federation is taking&#13;
steps to change the rules and normatives governing the assigning of unemployment benefits and to link&#13;
unemployment benefits to the subsistence income. For the purposes of continued implementation of&#13;
these approaches, it is necessary to ensure an objective assessment of efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
measures taken.&#13;
3.           At the same time, the current situation on the Russian labor market is characterized by a&#13;
combination of three major aspects:&#13;
*  a relatively low level of official unemployment, which, however, demonstrates an upward&#13;
trend;&#13;
*  wide spread partial employment which is often forced by the general decline of production&#13;
and financial instability of many industrial enterprises, and which, consequently, has to be&#13;
viewed as partial and covert unemployment. The gravest danger this process presents from&#13;
the social point of view is that this trend is increasingly acquiring a chronic nature; and&#13;
*  development of informal employment both among people formally employed in the real&#13;
sector, and among people having the status of unemployed and officially registered with&#13;
employment service offices.&#13;
4.           The processes described above are developing simultaneously and quite intensively. At&#13;
the same time, unemployment can not be fully compensated for by the growing demand for work force in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
the informal sector of the economy, since the capacity of the informal labor market is very much&#13;
differentiated across the regions.&#13;
5.           An efficient labor market policy is impossible to pursue in the absence of qualitative and&#13;
quantitative analysis of the situation and the situation's dynamics along the above lines. For example, the&#13;
need to increase social protection of the unemployed requires that the amount of unemployment benefits&#13;
be raised. However, actual implementation of this measure would mean that "bogus unemployed", that is&#13;
people who in fact derive income from employment in various sectors of the economy, must be excluded&#13;
from the eligible category of recipients. The process of tightening eligibility criteria was already initiated&#13;
in connection with the implementation of amendments to the Employment Law enacted in May 1996.&#13;
New steps are being taken along the same lines. The efficiency and scale of such steps also require an&#13;
analysis.&#13;
6.           In this connection it is necessary to introduce monitoring which would be aimed at&#13;
studying the material and economic condition of the individuals registered with employment service&#13;
offices, and also at evaluating a broader range of issues on the Russian labor market, in particular&#13;
assessing the scale and forms of covert processes.&#13;
B. Objective&#13;
e analysis of the labor market situation including structural shifts, assessment of scope and&#13;
dynamics of latent processes;&#13;
* assessment of adequacy of labor market statistics as compared to the real situation; and&#13;
*  development of measures aimed at regulation of processes and stabilization of the labor&#13;
market situation.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
7.            Attaining the above objective requires that the following tasks be resolved:&#13;
8.            Task One - Determining the selection&#13;
8.1    Determining the selection of communities where to conduct the monitoring exercise.&#13;
8.1.1  Justification of the criteria used to determine the selection of regions. Such criteria must&#13;
include various types of economic structures (monoeconomic and mutlisector type of&#13;
production), the level of officially registered unemployment, the level of covert unemployment,&#13;
the level and dynamics of population incomes, the nature and intensity of migration flows&#13;
(regions where migrants depart from and regions where they go to), types of communities,&#13;
predominance of urban or rural population, demographic criteria etc.&#13;
8.1.2  Methodological justification of the selection's representation for various criteria.&#13;
8.2   Justification of criteria for selection of respondents participating in the survey.&#13;
8.2.1  Justification of criteria to deternine the selection. The selection must ensure&#13;
representation of various focus groups. Major social groups covered by the proposed monitoring&#13;
exercise include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
* individuals registered with employment service offices (including with a breakdown&#13;
by group in accordance with the classification of the Federal Employment Service);&#13;
* employed population, including those employed full-time; partially employed,&#13;
individuals on administrative leave etc.;&#13;
* individuals nearing the retirement age;&#13;
* youth.&#13;
8.2.2  To develop methods of involving other focus groups in the survey, for instance&#13;
individuals with secondary employment, seasonal employment, temporary employment etc.&#13;
9.           Task Two. To justify the forrn, method and regularity of carrying out monitoring&#13;
exercises for individual focus groups (filling in questionnaires, interviewing etc.).&#13;
10.          Task Three. To develop a list of questions for monitoring participants for various focus&#13;
groups; develop questionnaires and plans of interviews for survey participants; develop instructions on&#13;
the procedure of interviewing and using questionnaires.&#13;
The questions must seek to implement the following objectives:&#13;
-  to obtain information on changes in the amount of the unemployment benefits for various&#13;
groups of recipients, including amounts of additional benefits for dependents, and changes in&#13;
the share of the unemployment benefit in the gross household budget;&#13;
&#149;  to estimate the number of people who have lost the right to be registered as unemployed or&#13;
receive unemployment benefits as a result of the enactment of new regulatory acts and&#13;
criteria;&#13;

UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE&#13;
ANNEX 5.6 - FINANCIAL REVIEW OF THE EMPLOYMENT FUND&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to reform the Government's&#13;
social policy and safety net programs. The World Bank-financed Social Protection Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SPAL) aims at improving the poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social protection system. In&#13;
the area of employment and labor markets the reforms will improve the effectiveness of the system of&#13;
unemployment benefits and the efficiency of use of the Employment Fund for benefit payments and the&#13;
financing of active labor market programs.&#13;
2.    Since the beginning of transition, unemployment has emerged as an important social issue, and&#13;
registered job seekers total some 2.6 million (1996). At the same time, short-time arrangements and&#13;
administrative leave are widespread, and increasing numbers of workers are moving into the informal&#13;
sector (an estimated 16% of the labor force in 1996). Unemployment benefits are set as a share of&#13;
previous earnings, initially at 75%, and declining to 45% over a twelve month period. Eligibility&#13;
depends on satisfying an earnings requirement (26 weeks in the previous year). People with shorter work&#13;
history or no work history receive a minimum benefit equal to the minimum wage. Actual benefits are&#13;
low: currently, the average unemployment benefit is about 80% of minimum subsistence, and the&#13;
minimum benefit is less than 20% of minimum subsistence. These benefit levels are insufficient to&#13;
serve effectively either as a buffer against poverty or as a means to facilitate job search and take&#13;
advantage of active labor market programs. The requirements of the Government's stabilization program&#13;
will not allow substantial increases in benefit levels.&#13;
3.    Benefits are paid out of the Employment Fund (EF), an extra-budgetary fund managed by the&#13;
Ministry of Labor and Social Development (MLSD). The EF draws its revenues from a 1.5% payroll&#13;
tax, and its resources are also used to pay for active labor market programs and miscellaneous activities,&#13;
and administration of the Fund and its activities. Miscellaneous activities include employment and&#13;
investment subsidies to enterprises, selected early retirement pensions and recreational support to&#13;
households with unemployed members (family benefits). In 1995, 28% of EF revenues were spent on&#13;
payment of unemployment benefits.&#13;
4.           The Government is envisaging a number of measures to improve the efficiency of&#13;
benefit provision, including revision of the replacement rate, reduction of the duration of benefit&#13;
payments in certain instances, and restrictions on eligibility. It also intends to introduce an annual&#13;
financial review of the operations of the Employment Fund. With the introduction of such new&#13;
measures, the Government intends to undertake a number of consultancies to (I) develop a mechanism&#13;
for continuous monitoring the labor market, including a review of the impact of changes in benefits and&#13;
benefit provision on beneficiaries; and (iii) undertake a financial review of the EF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
5.           The financial review of the EF is to lead, as quickly as possible, to the production of a&#13;
set of financial statements for the EF which are prepared in accordance with international accounting&#13;
standards and are shown by independent audit to be in conformity with those standards. This process&#13;
will assure that the financial management practices and procedures are as efficient and effective as&#13;
possible and that the moneys collected by the EF are managed efficiently and applied as intended.&#13;
6.           The consultant to be employed for this task will survey the accounting practices and&#13;
financial statements of the EF, determine the extent to which they conform or deviate from intermational&#13;
standards, and develop the terns of reference for the subsequent review.&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
7.           Task One - Review of Current Procedures. The consultant will review the current&#13;
financial management procedures and compile a composite picture of the Fund's administrative structure&#13;
and payment systems. Based on this review, the consultant will provide an opinion on the degree to&#13;
which the current financial systems can be relied upon to produce financial statements that are in&#13;
compliance with international accounting standards and an explanation of the areas where these systems&#13;
may have to be adjusted in order to produce such statements.&#13;
8.           Task Two - Terms of Reference for Financial Review. The consultant will then&#13;
draw up terms of reference for the initial comprehensive financial review of the fund. Such terms will&#13;
take into account the characteristics of the current procedures, any particular requirements of Russian&#13;
law, the time frames incorporated for the financial review in the SPAL, and the funding available for the&#13;
review. To the extent appropriate, the terms of reference should include:&#13;
(a) production of a balance sheet, an income statement and a cash flow statement for both the EF&#13;
program and EF administrative accounts at December 31, 1996 and the year then ended. These&#13;
statements should be in an internationally accepted format and, to the extent possible, in&#13;
conformity with international accounting standards;&#13;
(b) provision of a professional opinion on the restated financial statements with an explanation of&#13;
which items do not comply with international standards and an estimate of the impact of such&#13;
differences;&#13;
(c) identification of weaknesses in the current system of internal controls and recommendation&#13;
of measures necessary to correct these weaknesses so as to reduce the possibility of fraud;&#13;
(d) recommendations for: (i) changes in the financial management processes and the associated&#13;
accounting systems which will improve efficiency and enable the preparation of financial&#13;
statement that comply with international accounting standards, and (ii) a practical sequence of&#13;
steps to be taken to institute these changes; and&#13;
(e) identification of staff training needs and hardware and software needs in order to introduce&#13;
the changes and manage the new system.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
9.           This assignment is estimated to require six weeks.&#13;

least two years experience working with accounting systems in the Russian Federation, (c) have experience&#13;
in working with financial management systems in western public or private pension programs, life&#13;
insurance companies, or enterprises engaged in similar activities. Ability to speak and read Russian is&#13;
desirable.&#13;
F. Outputs&#13;
11.          The consultant will supply a report on current financial management procedures as outlined&#13;
in Task One and the Terms of Reference outlined in Task Two.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
12.          The Ministry of Finance will establish a high level working group to oversee the&#13;
preparation of all audit and financial systems development work. It will have representation from the&#13;
Ministry of Labor and Social Development, the State Tax Service and the Government Apparat. The&#13;
MLSD will establish an internal task force to work with the consultant and provide information and&#13;
financial documentation sufficient to enable the consultant to make determinations necessary to the&#13;
accomplishment of the work to be performed. The consultant will use this material and guidance to&#13;
prepare detailed terms of reference for the performance of the financial review.&#13;
13.          The consultant will work in the office of the First Deputy Minister of the Ministry of&#13;
Labor and Social Development, and work with that official and the other senior officials involved in&#13;
pension reform, as well as the task force established in the fund.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE&#13;
ANNEX 5.7 - REVIEW OF PROGRAMS FOR THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Difficulties and delays in the restructuring of the Russian economy at the enterprise level&#13;
have caused painful adjustments in the labor market. One consequence has been an increase both in the&#13;
duration of unemployment and in the share of long-term unemployed. At the end of 1995, out of 2.3&#13;
million registered job seekers, 14 percent were unemployed more than one year, and 18 percent for eight&#13;
to twelve months. The average duration of unemployment was 6.3 months. In the first quarter of 1997,&#13;
the share of long-term unemployed out of 2.5 million registered unemployed has increased to 20 percent,&#13;
and the share of registered unemployed being out ofjob for 8 to 12 months, equaled 17 percent. The&#13;
average duration of unemployment has increased to 7.1 months.&#13;
2.           The long-term unemployed are marginalized. Finding a job takes longer for females, for&#13;
disabled job seekers, for refugees and IDPs, and for those living in the rural areas. Long-term&#13;
unemployment affects the most vulnerable groups and least re-employable part of the unemployment&#13;
pool, as well as those living in depressed regions with high unemployment. As a result, such job seekers&#13;
loose their qualifications, skills and knowledge. Long-term unemployment is to a large extent a regional&#13;
phenomenon, with the unemployed concentrated in several economically depressed areas. The share of&#13;
long-term unemployed exceeds more than half of registered job seekers in many high unemployment&#13;
regions.&#13;
3.           The major goal of the project is to implement appropriate programs for the long-term&#13;
unemployed. According to the current law on employment, between the 13th and 18th month of&#13;
unemployment, the registered unemployed do not qualify for assistance from local employment offices&#13;
although they still remain on the roster of job seekers. After 18 months, registered job seekers can once&#13;
again apply for the minimum unemployment benefit. During this cycle, some special measures are&#13;
needed to assist them to maintain contact with the job market, participate in public works, and pursue&#13;
their job search while they receive minimum income guarantee.&#13;
B. Objectives&#13;
4.           The objective of the consultancy is to review the current programs aimed at the long-&#13;
term unemployed in order to work out legislative initiatives and practical recommendations to improve&#13;
social protection for these groups, including their active involvement in public works, training programs&#13;
and other activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106-&#13;
C. Job Description&#13;
5.           The consultant will:&#13;
(a) undertake selective surveys among long-term unemployed in three regions to determine&#13;
causes of social marginalization;&#13;
(b) review the current labor and social legislation aimed at the long-term unemployed, regional&#13;
differences in the level of long-term unemployment, and practices to support job seeking activities by&#13;
local employment offices;&#13;
(c) prepare concrete recommendations on improving the current labor legislation aimed at long-&#13;
term unemployment;&#13;
(d) propose recommendations to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development on the&#13;
implementation of activities to enhance employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed to&#13;
facilitate their reintegration; and&#13;
(e) prepare recommendations on additional social guarantees for the long-term unemployed,&#13;
especially in regions of high unemployment.&#13;
D. Duration of Assignment&#13;
6.           It is expected that this assignment will require three consultant months of technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
E. Experience and Qualification&#13;
7.           Consultants must have a minimum of 5 years experience and expertise on Russian labor&#13;
market policy issues -- in employment services or research. Consultants should also have international&#13;
knowledge of type of programs used for long-term unemployed.&#13;
F. Expected Outputs&#13;
8.           Report and recommendations on the current status of programs aimed at long-term&#13;
unemployed, including their usage and effectiveness. Recommendations should be included to change&#13;
and improve these programs or the introduction of new programs.&#13;
G. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
9.           The Ministry of Labor and Social Development will oversee the effort. Assistance in the&#13;
contracting of individual consultants will be managed by the Foundation for Social Sector Reforms.&#13;

A. Background&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation has embarked upon a major effort to reform its national system&#13;
of social assistance, unemployment, and pensions programs. The Government has strengthened its&#13;
leadership structure by appointing a new First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of social policy, the&#13;
Ministries of Labor and Social Protection have been merged into a single ministry, and a number of&#13;
middle-level reform minded officials have been appointed to positions of influence. The key areas to be&#13;
addressed are social insurance (including pensions and short-term insurance for sickness and maternity),&#13;
unemployment assistance, social assistance, and child allowances.&#13;
2.           The World Bank approved on June 25, 1997 a Social Protection Adjustment Loan&#13;
(SPAL), which is designed to improve the poverty focus and institutional capacity of the social&#13;
protection system. The program calls for reforms in the pension system, unemployment assistance, child&#13;
allowances, and social assistance. The SPAL will be accompanied by a policy implementation loan&#13;
(SPIL) which will support the implementation of these efforts over a three year period.&#13;
3.           The Government has decided to establish a new structure to implement the social&#13;
reforms promoted by the SPAL, which are to be supported by this project, by creating the Russian&#13;
Foundation for Social Reforms (the Foundation) which will act as the Project's main implementing entity&#13;
and the Government's major focal point for organizing the efforts necessary to support social protection&#13;
reforms through the year 2000, and possibly beyond.&#13;

Management Board is responsible for the implementation of the objectives and purposes as specified in&#13;
the Foundation's Charter. The Directorate is the executive body of the Foundation in charge of&#13;
managing the operations of the Foundation. The Expert Council is the professional expert body of the&#13;
Foundation. The Foundation's annual budget, operating procedures, and key personnel will be subject to&#13;
Bank prior review. The first year's budget has been agreed upon with the Bank. Appointment of key&#13;
staff has been made in consultation with the Bank and on the basis of short lists. Subsequent budgets&#13;

            Implementation Loan Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            As a companion project to the Social
            Protection Adjustment Loan (SPAL), the Social Protection
            Implementation Loan Project (SPIL) supports its
            implementation; it discusses gradually developing an
            effective system of income support and poverty relief to
            meet the needs of a market economy. The key areas covered by
            the SPAL are social insurance (including pensions and
            short-term insurance for sickness and maternity),
            unemployment assistance, social assistance, and child
            allowances. In addition, the SPIL will support a broader
            program for social protection including monitoring systems,
            data analysis, and reviews of on-going programs for
            unemployment and social protection. The SPIL will be
            disbursed in three tranches, the first of which will be
            released upon loan effectiveness. The first of the five
            components, pension reform, includes technical assistance
            and training in managing worker accounts, establishing a
            regulatory framework, auditing, implementing an action plan
            to improve collections, preparing legislation, designing and
            implementing a public information campaign, and organizing
            actuarial activities. The second component, social
            assistance, will provide technical assistance and training
            to help the government design and implement programs,
            including some pilots, in certain oblasts; conducting
            national evaluation and dissemination programs; reviewing
            social benefits and other allocations; and reviewing the
            system of local delivery of social services. The third
            component, social protection, will help the government put
            in place a system monitoring all regional and national
            social transfers; analyze data and monitor poverty and
            nutrition levels; survey household welfare and program
            participation nationally; and review governmental and
            non-governmental programs aimed at child protection, the
            handicapped, and the homeless. The fourth component, child
            allowances, provides technical assistance, training, and
            equipment supporting pilot programs. The fifth component,
            unemployment assistance, provides technical assistance and
            training to design and implement a system monitoring
            unemployment and changes in response to new laws or
            measures; and to establish an adequate system of social
            assistance during heavy unemployment.
