Dear Mr. Telnes&#13;
1.    We are pleased to acknowledge on behalf of the International Bank for&#13;

Fund ("BioCF") that the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) (the&#13;
"Donor") shall make available as a grant a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty million&#13;
Norwegian Kroner (NOK 150 000 000) (the "Contribution") for the BioCF Technical&#13;
Assistance Trust Fund, TF No. 052033 (the "Trust Fund") in accordance with the terms of&#13;
this Administration Agreement (the "Agreement") for the period of 2014-2017. Other&#13;
donors are also expected to contribute to the Trust Fund on the terms and conditions&#13;
specified in the Annexes to this Agreement.&#13;
2.    The Contribution shall be used to finance the activities and the categories of&#13;
expenditure set forth in the "Description of Activities and Expenditures under the BioCF&#13;
Technical Assistance Trust Fund" attached hereto as Annex 1, and shall be administered&#13;
by the Bank on behalf of the Donor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement&#13;
including the "Standard Provisions Applicable to the BioCF Technical Assistance Trust&#13;

5.    The Contribution is being provided in Installments on the basis of financial needs&#13;

Donor.&#13;
6.    When making such deposit, the Donor shall instruct its bank to include in its&#13;

Trust Fund, namely United States dollars, promptly upon receipt of the Contribution funds&#13;
and the Deposit Instruction containing the information specified in paragraph 4 at the&#13;
exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where the Contribution&#13;
proves to be insufficient to complete the activities as a result of an exchange rate&#13;

additional financing.&#13;
