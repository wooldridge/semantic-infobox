&#13;
A course on macroeconomic management was held in Ankara, Turkey, from July 7-17, 1998,&#13;
by the Economic Development Institute (EDI). The background work that led to the&#13;
development of this course showed that stability enhancing policies and policies that help to&#13;
secure investment can lead to a reduction in the incidence of poverty. Therefore, this course&#13;
aimed to promote those kinds of macroeconomic policies through two primary course&#13;
objectives. First, it aimed to improve participant ability to investigate, debate and formulate&#13;
policies related to macroeconomic issues. The second goal was to facilitate the transfer of&#13;
macroeconomic knowledge to a wider audience through participant-trainers and participating&#13;
training institutions. To accomplish these goals, the course reviewed current analytical and&#13;
methodological advances in the field of development macroeconomics in Turkey, the Middle&#13;
East, and transition economies. The targeted audience was the World Bank staff, policy&#13;
advisors in government, university professors, and researchers.&#13;
&#13;
An evaluation was done by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES) covering several aspects of the&#13;
course. A set of cognitive questions was randomly assigned to pre-test and post-test groups.&#13;
These questions were administered at the beginning and end of the course, and were used to&#13;
measure learning gain as a result of the course. Participants were asked to give their opinion&#13;
about the course objectives, relevance, content, timing, delivery and faculty. Participants&#13;
were also asked to assess how much they had learned on selected topics from the course.&#13;
All questions on the evaluation used a 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1=minimum&#13;
to 5=maximum. Results from the evaluation are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Of 24 participants, 19 (74%) responded to the questionnaire. Demographic information&#13;
        was limited, however it did show that there was a relatively high number of female&#13;
        participants (11 of 19 respondents, 58%) in the course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  The evaluation questionnaire asked participants for their opinions about items falling&#13;
        into 6 categories. The category that received the most favorable responses addressed&#13;
        the relevance of the course. For the 3 questions covering relevance, the range of mean&#13;
        scores was 4.05 to 4.63 on a 5 point scale. An evaluation of the same core course,&#13;
        held earlier in Washington D.C. also showed that participants found the course highly&#13;
        relevant. For that course, the mean scores ranged from 4.33 to 4.39 out of 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Items related to the delivery of the course also received mean scores in the high range&#13;
        (4.00 to 4.58). These results show that respondents were highly satisfied with the way&#13;
        in which the course content was conveyed, including the presentation, materials,&#13;
        examples and teaching aids. This is especially important as one of the objectives of&#13;
        the course was to train participants to present the course content to a wider audience&#13;
        in the future.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lThe category of items that received the lowest range of mean scores was that of time&#13;
 and sequencing (3.63 to 3.84). The four items in this category asked if the work load&#13;
 was adequate (mean=3.84), if topics were effectively balanced (mean=3.63), if they&#13;
 were covered in sufficient depth (mean=3.84) and if there was adequate time for&#13;
 discussion (3.74). Written comments suggest that some participants found the&#13;
 course demanding, and would have appreciated an extra day of class.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe VAR segment of the course achieved the largest perceived knowledge gains. The&#13;
 scores for the VAR techniques and applications changed from 2.53 before the course&#13;
 to 4.00 after the course, an increase of 1.47 (58%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lThe item covering the topics of consumption, saving and investment received the least&#13;
 favorable pre/post change score (.42). However, this does not necessarily indicate a&#13;
 weakness in teaching method. Since the pre-course mean for this item (3.79) was the&#13;
 highest pre-course mean of all the self-assessment questions, it may be that the&#13;
 participants were more knowledgeable on these issues and consequently, that the&#13;
 course material could have started at a more advanced level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lResults from the randomly assigned cognitive questions showed little gain in this area&#13;
 by participants. The average (mean) number of correct answers on the pretest was&#13;
 7.24 out of 13, or 55.7%. Compared to other EDI courses that have used this method,&#13;
 this is a relatively high pretest score, suggesting that participants may have been&#13;
 more knowledgeable about the material than is the case in these other courses. The&#13;
 post-test score was 7.40, or 56.9% correct, a gain of slightly more than 1%. A t-test&#13;
 was conducted to measure the pre/post-test difference. The t-value with 30 degrees of&#13;
 freedom was -0.176, which was not statistically significant (p = .861). Higher pre-test&#13;
 scores may have been a factor in the inability of this test to detect a change.&#13;
