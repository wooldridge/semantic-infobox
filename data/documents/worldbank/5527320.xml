I. KEY OBJECTIVES OFTHE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMTO LIQUIDATE&#13;
BANRURALAND CREATE FINANCIERA RURAL&#13;
&#13;
3.      The broader policy objective o f this loan is to support an important stage of the reform of&#13;
Mexico's development banking sector.          Specifically, this loan supports the liquidation o f&#13;
Banrural, a Government owned development bank, and the creation, in its place, o f the new&#13;
Financiera Rural (FR), a non-banking decentralized institution that cannot mobilize deposits or&#13;
issue debt and that i s in charge o f promoting the development o f rural financial markets. FR i s&#13;
funded directly through budgetary allocations, it must maintain the value of its capital&#13;
endowment in real terms, report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle income&#13;
rural producers, and move, over time, fully to second-tier lending.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Since the mid-l980's, the Mexican Government has adopted measures to reform state-&#13;
owned financial institutions. In 1986, the Government approved Organic Laws (Charters) for all&#13;
development banks, creating a new charter: Sociedad Nacional de Cre`dito. The process o f&#13;
financial sector reform also involved modifications to risk classification and provisioning rules&#13;
for development bank loans (May 1993) and capitalizationrules (July 1994). The Tequila crisis&#13;
prompted the liquidation o f two development banks and induced the govemment to initiate&#13;
restructuring plans for the development bankingsystem. More recently, the National Programto&#13;
Finance Development (PRONAFIDE) for 2002-2006, calls for the modernization o f&#13;
development banks to help achieve the social and economic goals presented in the National&#13;
Development Plan.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The Government's efforts to reform the development banks are in line with the&#13;
recommendations o f the FSAP carried out inmid-2001. These efforts focus on three areas:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Legal and institutional reforms to promote and strengthen non-bank financial&#13;
        intermediaries and popular banking. These reforms include: (i)    enactment o f the Law o f&#13;
        Savings andPopular Credit (LACP) and amendment to the General Law o f Organizations&#13;
        and Auxiliary Credit Activities and to the General Law o f Cooperatives; (ii)   creation, in&#13;
       April 2001, o fthe National FinancialServices Bank (BANSEFI) to promote savings from&#13;
       among low-income populations and promote the development o f savings and credit&#13;
       institutions; (iii)creation, in mid-2001, o f the National Mortgage Bank (Sociedad&#13;
       H@otecaria Federal- SHF) a development bank for housing finance; and (iv)&#13;
       development, in late 2002, o f FIRA's (Agricultural Related Trust Fund) program to lend&#13;
       through special purpose finance companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Legal and regulatory reforms to improve the governance and accountability o f&#13;
       development banks. During 2000 and 2002, reforms were introduced to subject&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        development banks to the same regulation and supervision as commercial banks. These&#13;
        reforms also aim at promoting the operational efficiency and cost effectiveness o f&#13;
        development banks, and limit the losses that they may cause to the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Restructuring o f development banks.          The restructuring emphasized their role o f&#13;
        development agencies in charge of developing the financial markets in areas not well&#13;
        covered by the private banks. As development agencies, these institutions are funded&#13;
        directly through the budget, ceasing to take deposits from, and issue debt to the public.&#13;
        Their lending activities are (over time in some cases) limited to second-tier lending&#13;
        through banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, and their capacity to provide&#13;
        subsidies is limited,makingthose that they provide more targeted andtransparent.&#13;
&#13;
6.      These reforms set the basis for a more efficient and transparent development banking&#13;
sector, and go a long way towards reducing the problems associated with direct government&#13;
intervention inthe banking sector such as lack o f transparency inthe allocation o f subsidies, high&#13;
hidden fiscal costs, and negative incentives for private providers o f financial services. Within&#13;
this framework, the Government o f Mexico decided to close Banrural, which was the public&#13;
bank that generates the largest fiscal losses, and create inits place Financiera Rural.&#13;
&#13;
11.     PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Government o f Mexico has made major advances in the implementation of its&#13;
program, including measures taken prior to Board Presentation incompliance with First Tranche&#13;
Release conditions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0  Congress approved on December 13, 2002 the Charter of Financiera Rural (Ley&#13;
           Orghnica de la Financiera Rural -LOFR).&#13;
        0  Congress approved on December 13, 2002 a modification to the Incomes L a w o f the&#13;
           Federation for the Fiscal Year 2002, to include a budgetary allocation of MXP49.9&#13;
           billion to liquidate B a m r a l and to provide an initial equity andbudget to FR.&#13;
           The Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) approved, on April 1, 2003,&#13;
           procedures for the liquidation o f the Banrural System as a banking institution.&#13;
        0  FRprovided to the Bank a Strategic Statement (Programa Institucional) approved by&#13;
           its Board o f Directors (Organo de Gobierno), outlining mission and objectives, target&#13;
           markets and clients, instruments for providing credit, promoting investment and&#13;
           providing technical assistance, and a policy of limited credit expansion (no more than&#13;
           10percent) inthe first year o foperations with respect to the level o f lending provided&#13;
           byBanrural in2002.&#13;
           FR submitted to the Bank a financial projections model o f its operations, agreed to&#13;
           with the Bank. The modelincluded pro-forma balance sheets and income statements.&#13;
       0   FR provided to the Bank a Regional Organization Plan approved by its Board&#13;
           establishing the number of branches (no more than loo),                 their geographic&#13;
           distribution, and branch staffing levels based on projected size ofbranches.&#13;
       0   The management structure o f FR was established, including: the nomination o f the&#13;
           Board o f Directors, formed by representatives from the Federal Government, the&#13;
           social sectors and an independent counselor. The top management was nominated,&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             including the General Management (Direccidn General). Four main Committees&#13;
             have been established: Operations, Credit, Risks and Human Resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
111.     ACTIONS TAKEN TO FULFILL THE SECOND TRANCHE RELEASE&#13;
CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
A.       Satisfactory Progressin carrying out the Program&#13;
&#13;
       Loan Agreement, Article 11, Section 2.02 (d) (i):Bank to be satisfied, based on&#13;
       evidence satisfactory to the Bank, with the progress achieved in the carrying out of&#13;
       the Program.&#13;
&#13;
8.       This conditionhasbeen met. The Bankreceived a letter of Sector Development Policy,&#13;
signed by the Subsecretary o f Finance and Public Credit, dated May 9, 2003 describing the&#13;
strategy that the Government i s following for the restructuring o f its development banks, with&#13;
particular focus on the liquidation o f Banrural and the creation o f FR. The Letter indicates the&#13;
commitment o f the Government to:&#13;
&#13;
         Require FR to implement interest rate policies congruent with the objective o f financial&#13;
         sustainability requiredby its Charter. To this objective, the authorities are adjusting the&#13;
         interest rates charged by FIRA to avoid creating incentives for interest rate arbitrage&#13;
         among clients that are common to both institutions; and&#13;
         Provide, ifrequired inthe short term, and for a limitedperiod o f time, budgetary support&#13;
         to cover part o f FR's operating costs to allow it to lend at low but close to marketinterest&#13;
        rates to its lower income clients. Interest rates charged by FR should always cover the&#13;
         fundingcosts andthe risk ofthe operation avoidingmarket distortions.&#13;
&#13;
9.      At the closing of October 2004, FR had placed 139,946 loans for MXP6.9 million, with&#13;
an average loan size o f MXP52,OOO. As o f that date, the book value o fthe portfolio amounted to&#13;
MXP6.374 billion, with a non-performing ratio o f less than 4 percent. FR's operations during&#13;
2004 have not requiredsubsidies or transfers from the Federal Government. These results show&#13;
that FR's management has been successfbl in establishing the basis for a financially viable&#13;
institution.&#13;
&#13;
B.      MacroeconomicPerformance&#13;
&#13;
      Loan Agreement, Article 11, Section 2.02 (d) (ii):Bank to be satisfied, based on&#13;
      evidence satisfactory to the Bank, that the macroeconomic policy framework is&#13;
      satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
10.     This condition has been met. Mexico's economic recovery started inthe fourth quarter&#13;
o f 2003 and continued during 2004. Real GDP expanded by 3.9 percent year-on-year inthe first&#13;
half o f 2004 and by 4.4 percent year-on-year during the third quarter o f 2004, marking ten&#13;
consecutive quarters o f expansion. GDP growth for 2004 i s expected to remain above 4 percent.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This robust economic growthreflects a strong dynamism o f exports, particularly to the USA, and&#13;
the strengthening o f the domestic demand.       The economic recovery o f the U S A and high&#13;
international oil prices resulted in exports expanding by 13.3 percent in the first half o f 2004&#13;
compared with the same period in 2003. Imports increased at a rate o f 10.2 percent during the&#13;
same period. High remittances from Mexicans working abroad and the expansion o f domestic&#13;
credit has stimulated consumption growth and, more recently, investment, including foreign&#13;
direct investment (FDI). In this favorable environment, the current account deficit o f the first&#13;
half o f 2004 was nearly one third lower than that o f the first half o f 2003. By end-2004, the&#13;
current account deficit is expected to be about 1.4percent o f GDP.&#13;
&#13;
 11.     The recovery in demand and consistently high prices o f some raw materials has fuelled&#13;
inflationary pressures, although inflation remains low compared with historical levels.         In&#13;
November 2004, annual inflation reached 5.4 percent, above the 4 percent upper limit o f the&#13;
Central Bank (BOM) inflation target for 2004. This situation has led BOM to tighten monetary&#13;
supply through increases in the "corto" (the borrowed reserves objective) with the resulting&#13;
increase in domestic interest rates.     However, the peso-dollar exchange rate has shown a&#13;
tendency to strengthening, which is helping to moderate inflationary expectations.&#13;
&#13;
12.      During the 2004, fiscal policy has been oriented to meet the fiscal deficit target o f 0.3&#13;
percent o f GDP. To this effect, approval of increases inpublic expending above the 2004 budget&#13;
require prior additional revenues from oil exports. It is estimated that at by end-2004, the public&#13;
deficit, not counting the expenditures for the Program o f Voluntary Separations, will be within&#13;
the 0.3 percent target. Market sentiment toward Mexico remains positive as evidenced by its&#13;
investment-grade status.&#13;
&#13;
13.      The expectation is that economic growth will decelerate to 3.5 percent in2005, as a result&#13;
o f the recent tightening of monetary policy, a possible deceleration o f economic growth in the&#13;
USA, and delays in getting Congressional approval o f important structural reforms to boost&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The IMFBoard concluded the 2004 Article lV Consultation with Mexico on October 18,&#13;
2004.      Directors commended the authorities for policies that continued to underpin&#13;
macroeconomic stability and investor confidence. They welcomed the authorities' commitment&#13;
to further fiscal consolidation and endorsed their medium-term goals, which call for further fiscal&#13;
adjustments to lower ratios o f pubic debt to GDP. Directors stressed the need to reinvigorate the&#13;
structural reform agenda, where recent progress had been disappointing owing to difficulties in&#13;
forging the needed political consensus.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Other Actions&#13;
&#13;
     (a) the institutions conforming the BanruralSystemhave ceased to operate as banking&#13;
    institutions; (b) the licenses to operate as banking institutions of the institutions&#13;
    conformingthe BanruralSystemhave been revokedby SHCP; (c) the remainingassets&#13;
    of the institutionsconformingthe BanruralSystemhavebeentransferredto Financiera&#13;
    Rural or directly or indirectly, to a liquidating agency; and (d) the deposit accounts&#13;
    opened in the institutions conforming the Banrural System have been closed or&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                  5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    transferred to one or moreinstitutionsauthorizedby CNBV and/or SHCP to operateas&#13;
    financialinstitutions.&#13;
&#13;
15.     This condition hasbeenmet. The liquidation o f the Banrural systemwas established in&#13;
the LOFR in Article 2 and Transitory articles Second, Third and Tenth. Article 2 authorizes the&#13;
Federal Government to fund the dissolution and liquidation of the Banrural System. Article&#13;
Second Transitory establishes that as o f July 2, 2003, the Organic Law o f the Banrural System is&#13;
abrogated as well as the organic regulations o f the thirteen credit institutions that conform the&#13;
Banrural System. Article Third Transitory decrees the dissolution and orders the liquidation o f&#13;
the thirteen credit institutions that conform the Banrural System and establishes that their&#13;
liquidation should start on July 1, 2003. Article Tenth Transitory establishes that the movable&#13;
and immovable assets o f the credit institutions inliquidationwill be transferred to FR or to other&#13;
public entities following procedures to be determinedby the SHCP.&#13;
&#13;
16.     As confirmed by the legal opinion issued by SHCP, Banrural operated under a Charter&#13;
(Ley Organica) and not with a banking license from the SHCP. For this reason, SHCP cannot&#13;
revoke Banrural's banking license. However, the abrogation o f Banrural's Charter as o f July 2,&#13;
2003, implies the cessation o f Banrural's banking operations. Banrural still exists as an entity&#13;
under liquidation, because the judicial process o f liquidation takes long time, but it is not&#13;
authorized to operate as a bankinginstitution.&#13;
&#13;
17.     In April 2003, SHCP nominated the Fideicomiso Liquidador de Intituciones y&#13;
Organizaciones Auxiliares de Credito (FIDELIC) as liquidator o f the Banrural System. The&#13;
liquidator, under instructions o f SHCP, proceeded to transfer Banrural's good assets to FR,&#13;
including loans as well as movable and immovable assets. The transfer process ended in&#13;
November 2004. Assets transferred to FR amount to MXP2.108 billion o f credit portfolio and&#13;
MXP240.3 million of fixed assets. Banrual's residual assets remain in a find administered by&#13;
SAE (a successor o f FIDELIC) for their liquidation. The deposit accounts inBanruralhave been&#13;
transferred to BANSEFI.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Evidence presented o f these transfers are the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Oficio nominating the "liquidador" o f the Banrural System. Oficio No. 368 -069/03 o f&#13;
        April 1,2003, from the Director General SHCP to the Director General o fFIDELIC.&#13;
    0   Oficio No. 368-VI-1062/04, from the Directora General Adjunta o f SHCP, providing&#13;
        legal opinion confirming that: (a) the institutions o fthe Banrural System are inprocess o f&#13;
        liquidation and dissolution and do not have anymore attributions to operate as credit&#13;
       institutions; and (b) Banrural and Financiera Rural are entities o f the Federal Public&#13;
       Administration, governed by their own charters; and that these entities, prior to their&#13;
       dissolution, could perform banking and credit services, as described in their charters,&#13;
       without the needfor an authorization or "license" from the Federal Government.&#13;
   0   Certification o f the transfers o f asset o f the BANRURAL System to FR. Oficio No.&#13;
       DG/023/04 o f June 11, 2004, from the Director Gelteral o f Banrural under Liquidation,&#13;
       to the Director General o f SHCP, certifying that loans and credits from Barural and&#13;
       movable and immovable assets have been transferred to FR, and that the conciliation o f&#13;
       the amounts involvedhadbeen carried out by the liquidator with the favorable opinion o f&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

         General o f SHCP to the Liquidador o f Banrural and the Director General o f FR. These&#13;
         oficios authorize the liquidator to transfer to FRremaining liquid assets.&#13;
         Dispositions and actions related to the transfer o f the deposit accounts in Banrural to&#13;
         BANSEFI. Oficio No. 368-087/03 of April 29, 2003, from the Director General of&#13;
         SHCP to the Director General del Banco Nacional de Credit0 Rural, giving his no&#13;
         objection to the transfer o f Banrural's deposits to BANSEFI. This oficio refers to the&#13;
         favorable opinions to the transfer issuedby BOM and CNBV.&#13;
&#13;
     FinancieraRural has provided to the Bank a Strategic Plan approved by Financiera's&#13;
     Board which: (a) provides an empirical analysis identifying Financiera's target&#13;
     markets, clients (includingtheir risk profile) and distribution systems and products to&#13;
     reach said clients; (b) directs Financiera's second-tier lending activities including; (i)a&#13;
     time frame for buildinga second-tier lendingbusiness; (ii)the organizationalstructure&#13;
     for conducting second-tier operations (including procedures to reduce conflict of&#13;
     interest betweenfirst and second-tier activities); (iii)the eligibility criteriafor potential&#13;
     financial intermediaries; and (iv) the basis of a technical assistance program to&#13;
     strengthennew ruralfinancialintermediaries;and (c) providesfor the establishment of&#13;
     a managementinformationsystemand financialcontrolsystemto monitor the activities&#13;
     of Financiera.&#13;
&#13;
 19.     This condition has been met. FR's Operations Committee approved the Strategic Plan&#13;
(SP) on November 30,2004. Evidence presented includes:&#13;
&#13;
     e   resolution o f FR's Consejo Directivo (Board) o f October 27, 2004, signed by its&#13;
         Prosecretario delegating to the Operating Committee the authority to analyze and&#13;
         authorize the SP o f the institution, based on Article 33 Section xxviii and Article 39,&#13;
         Section vi o f LOFR;&#13;
    e    copy o f the Minutes o f November 25, 2004, signedby its Acting Secretary inwhich the&#13;
         Operations Committee approves the SP ofthe institution;&#13;
    e    a document entitled Strategic Plan o f Financiera Rural, which delineates the medium&#13;
         term perspectives o f the institution and financial projections o f the operations for the year&#13;
         2004 to 2010; and&#13;
    e    copy o f the functional design and implementation details o f FR's Management&#13;
         Information System(MIS).&#13;
&#13;
20.      The SP o f FR has been elaborated with the assistance of an international consultant hired&#13;
by USAID, with terms o f reference that reflect the specific provisions for the SP spelledout in&#13;
the Bank's conditionality. The SP reviews the advances made by FR during its first year o f&#13;
operations and looks at the next stage as that o f consolidation and strengthening o f FR's&#13;
operations, and the establishment o f a second-tier lending business.          The SP spells out the&#13;
institution's mission and vision, as well as its objectives in several areas including: financial&#13;
objectives, evaluation and control o f risks, development o f systems, development o f new&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 products, and development of second-tier activities.          The approved SPYand other relevant&#13;
 documents elaborates on the following aspects:&#13;
&#13;
 21.     Provides an empirical analysis identijjing Financiera 's target markets, clients (including&#13;
 their risk profile) and distribution systems and products to reach said clients. Although an&#13;
 empirical analysis to identify new target markets has not been carried out, FR, with the help o f&#13;
 external consultants, has made an effort to develop the risk profile o f the client base received&#13;
 from Banrural, using historical data (two years). Based on this analysis, FR's Risk Management&#13;
 Unit calculates the risk premium that it incorporates inthe interest rates charged on different&#13;
 types o f loans. The risk premium i s based o n expected losses calculated as the probability of&#13;
 nonpayment multiplied by the exposure and by the severity of the loss. The expected loss i s&#13;
 reduced by the quality o f the guarantees. The risk profile of Banrural's clients has been used to&#13;
 develop credit scoring models.         Consequently, w e consider that this condition has been&#13;
 substantially met.&#13;
&#13;
 22.     Directs Financiera 's second-tier lending activities including;&#13;
                 a time frame for building a second-tier lending business. The SP enumerates the&#13;
                 actions that FR is taking, together with other government entities, to promote the&#13;
                 establishment o f rural financial intermediaries. The strategy recognizes that the&#13;
                number of financial intermediaries i s limited and that the development o f more&#13;
                intermediaries will take time. Based on the results of 2004, FR will identify the&#13;
                potential intermediaries and provide technical assistance, through third parties, to&#13;
                develop their capabilities. FR has as a target to increase the share o f second-tier&#13;
                lending to 25 percent by end-2006 andto 50 percent by end-2012;&#13;
                the organizational structure for conducting second-tier operations (including&#13;
                procedures to reduce conflict o f interest between first and second-tier activities).&#13;
                The SP proposes that in order to avoid conflicts between first and second-tier&#13;
                activities, these activities need to be clearly differentiated in the Credit Manual.&#13;
                Consequently, the Credit Manual has a separate section to regulate credit through&#13;
                financial intermediaries and applies different interest rates for these two activities.&#13;
                The SP envisages hrther studies to identify and address other potential conflict of&#13;
                interests between first and second-tier activities;&#13;
                the eligibility criteria for potential financial intermediaries. The eligibility criteria&#13;
                for financial intermediaries is spelled out inthe Credit Manual; and&#13;
                the basis of a technical assistance program to strengthen new rural financial&#13;
                intermediaries.    The SP builds on ongoing and h t u r e diagnostic work of the&#13;
                capabilities o f existing financial intermediaries, to provide the basis for a&#13;
                technical assistance program to improve their capabilities. The strategy envisions&#13;
                that the technical assistance services to financial intermediaries and to producers&#13;
                will be administered by a separate department and provided by third parties, to&#13;
                reduce conflict o f interests with its lending operations.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Provides for the establishment of a management information system (MIS,) andfinancial&#13;
control system to monitor the activities of Financiera. The SP establishes as a priority of the&#13;
institution the establishment o f an M I S and spells our the basis for its design. FR has advance&#13;
significantly in this objective.     FR started by improving the system that it inherited from&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Banrural. With software developed in-house, FR i s now able to conduct all its operations on-line&#13;
and to get information on a daily basis from all its branches (through dedicated lines). The basic&#13;
structure (functional design) o f the new MIS has been developed and it is already in operation.&#13;
Future improvements will depends on the completion of other modules from which it gets&#13;
information such as the accounting and credit modules. FR expects to have the MIS fully&#13;
operational during 2005. An important feature o f the new MIS i s that it will have a cost&#13;
allocation systemthat will allow senior management to evaluate the practices o f individual profit&#13;
centers. The MISwill allow management to measure results from the point o f view o f products,&#13;
clients and centers o fresponsibility.&#13;
&#13;
    Financiera Rural (a) has submitted to the Bank, manuals, approved by Financiera's&#13;
    board, including: (i)norms, policies and proceduresto provideloans; and (ii)recovery&#13;
    procedures for non-performing loans; and (b) has tested and implemented credit&#13;
    scoring modelsto determinethe eligibilityto receive loansfrom Financiera.&#13;
&#13;
24.     This condition has been met. The evidence presented with respect to compliance with&#13;
point (a) includes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   copy o f the resolution from FR's Board o f May 23,2003, which approves the Manual o f&#13;
        Norms and Credit Policies; and&#13;
        copy o fthe Manual o fNorms and Credit Policies (Credit Manual).&#13;
&#13;
25.     The Credit Manual contains nine chapters which describe the concepts, rules, norms,&#13;
participants and operations o f the four stages o f the credit process: business development,&#13;
analysis and decision, instrumentation, and follow-up and recovery. It also covers all the aspects&#13;
related to integration, custody, administrationand control o fthe credit files.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The evidence presentedwith respect to compliance with (b) includes:&#13;
&#13;
        0   a report o f activities o fthe Unit for the IntegralAdministration o fRisks (CAR); and&#13;
        0   a description o f the credit risk models implemented by FR, including the credit&#13;
            scoring system, its methodology and validation exercises.&#13;
&#13;
27.     FR has established a credit scoring system with the help of an international consulting&#13;
firm. The credit scoring systemis amethodofcredit risk evaluationbasedonparameters such as&#13;
the type o f credit or the socioeconomic characteristics o f the client. This system has been in&#13;
operation inFR, on an experimental basis, since September 2003. It has been implemented for&#13;
working capital loans below 200,000 U D I S (indexed investment units) since mid-July 2004.&#13;
Loans above 200,000 are evaluated individually. The main parameters to evaluate the credit risk&#13;
are socioeconomic characteristics o f the clients and characteristics o f the credit request. C A R&#13;
does a monthly follow-up o f the results generated by the models. Validation o f these models&#13;
will be carried out once enough result information i s available.&#13;
&#13;
   The Auditor has certified that Financira, as of six weeks before the Second Tranche&#13;
   Release Date, complies with CNBV's prudential regulations, includingnorms for risk&#13;
   classificationandprovisioningofloanportfolio.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.    This conditionhasbeen met. The evidence presentedis:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   Note by the extemal auditors, dated December 9, 2004, certifying that FR complied with&#13;
       the following:&#13;
&#13;
       For 2003:&#13;
       J FRrequested and obtained authorization from CNBV (OJicio No. 601-11-173332 of&#13;
             October 20,2003) to apply the methodology to determine the preventive estimates for&#13;
             credit risks corresponding to the period September 30 to December 31, 2003, the&#13;
             same that was authorized for the Banrural System for the commercialcredit portfolio.&#13;
       J According to Circular 1514 issued by the CNBV, FR recognized the preventive&#13;
             reserves to cover the determinedcredit risks.&#13;
       J The Financial Statements and the respective notes for the 2003 audited financial&#13;
             statements present the classification and grouping o f the credit portfolio according to&#13;
             the requirements established by the CNBV; according to Circular No.1488 which&#13;
             complements the accounting criteria o f Circular No. 1448 which i s in effect since&#13;
             January 1,2000.&#13;
&#13;
       For 2004:&#13;
       J The financial statements prepared for the 2004 fiscal year have been prepared&#13;
             according to the rules o f aggregation and accounting practices issuedby CNBV&#13;
       J FR requested and obtained authorization from CNBV (OJicio No. 601-11-6443 of&#13;
             September 29, 2004), to continue applying the methodology to determine the&#13;
             preventive estimates for credit risks until CNBV issues dispositions with general&#13;
             character;&#13;
       J The Financial Statements and the respective notes for the 2003 audited financial&#13;
             statements present the classification and grouping o f the credit portfolio according to&#13;
             the requirements established by the CNBV, according to Circular No.1488 which&#13;
             complements the accounting criteria o f Circular No. 1448 which i s in effect since&#13;
             January 1,2000&#13;
&#13;
   The subsidies and transfers receivedby Financieraunder any concept havebeenclearly&#13;
   declared and identified in each report submitted to the Borrower's Congress (up to six&#13;
   weeks beforethe Second Tranche Release) under Article 48 paragraphsI,11, and I11of&#13;
   the FinancieraLaw.&#13;
&#13;
29.    This condition has been met. FR has not received subsidies or transfers in the 2004&#13;
budget. Consequently, it has not had the needto report to Congress on this issue. The evidence&#13;
received i s the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       0    OJicio No. 313 A 000108 o f February 3, 2004 from the Director General o f&#13;
            Secretaria de Hacienda to the Director General de Banca de Desarrollo, SHCP,&#13;
            informing o f the budgets authorized to development banks and funds under the&#13;
            SHCP, including FR for 2004, and Annex to this OJicio with the budget for FR for&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            2004. In this budget, there is no authorized amount under the items subsidies and&#13;
            transfers o f the Federal Government to FR.&#13;
&#13;
30.     At the inception o f FRYthe Government and FR authorities recognized that the&#13;
Government would have to subsidize part o f FR's initial operating costs, to allow it to lend to the&#13;
poorer segment of its clients at a relatively low interest rate. This was deemed necessary due to&#13;
FIRA's subsidized interest rates to the same segment o fborrowers. It was agreed, however, that&#13;
subsidies would be a temporary and clearly identified measure, and that FR would implement a&#13;
policy on interest rates geared to ensure its financial sustainability (defined as net income equal&#13;
or greater than zero). However, since its inception, FR has followed a prudent lending strategy.&#13;
The level o f past due loans (loans with 91 days with no payment o f interest or principal) inFR is&#13;
less than 4 percent (compared with 48 percent for Banrural). The average interest rate charged&#13;
byFRis 12percent, slightly below the interest rate that FR'sfinancial model (developed with the&#13;
help o f IDB and the Bank) projected as necessary to maintain FR's capital in real terms, with&#13;
expectedprovisions of 4 percent.&#13;
&#13;
31.    Also, there have been some positive developments with respect to the ability of FR to&#13;
compete with FIRA's subsidized loans. First, the level o f subsidy o f FIRA's loans has decreased.&#13;
FIRA usedto lend at CETES (treasury bonds) minus 6 points, and required its intermediaries to&#13;
lend at CETES. N o w FIRA lends at TIIE (interbank equilibrium interest rate), which is above&#13;
CETES, minus six points, and allows its intermediaries to lend at market rates. Second, the&#13;
SHCP i s making an effort to better coordinate the activities o f all the agencies involved in rural&#13;
financing. The strategy in the short term contemplates closer coordination between FIRA, FR&#13;
and the other financial institutions, and possible a consolidation in one institution o f the back&#13;
office activities o f all public financial institutions. In the longer term, SHCP is considering the&#13;
merger o f FIRA and FR.&#13;
&#13;
IV.    CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
32.    Inview o fthe overall performance andprogresswiththe implementationo fthe program&#13;
supported by the Loan, and incompliance with the specific conditions o f release as described in&#13;
Section 2.02 (e) and Schedule 2 o f the Loan Agreement, the Bank has informedthe Borrower o f&#13;
the availability o f the second tranche inthe equivalent o fUSD 150 million.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The broader policy objective of the
            Rural Finance Development Structural Adjustment Loan Project
            is to support an important stage of the reform of
            Mexico's development banking sector. Specifically, this
            loan supports the liquidation of Banrural, a Government
            owned development bank, and the creation, in its place, of
            the new Financiera Rural (FR), a non-banking decentralized
            institution that cannot mobilize deposits, nor issue debt,
            while in addition, is in charge of promoting the development
            of rural financial markets. In view of the overall
            performance and progress with the implementation of the
            program supported by the Loan, and in compliance with the
            specific conditions of release as described in Section 2.02
            (e) and Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement, the second tranche
            is now released.
