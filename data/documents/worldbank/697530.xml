REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
BForrower:         Republic of Ghana&#13;
BenefIidary:       Ministry of Food and Agriculture&#13;
Amount:            SDR 6.2 million (US$9 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:             Standard with 40 years maturity&#13;
bZclQtWectives&#13;
and De OcriptIn:   The key objective of the project is to establish the long-term sustainability of&#13;
the fisheries resource and thereby maximize its contribution to the economy.&#13;
To achieve this objective, the project would strengthen the capacity of the&#13;
Department of Fisheries (DOF) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture&#13;
(MOFA) for managing the sub-sector focusing on: formulation of policy and&#13;
management plans and their implementation; monitoring, control, surveillance&#13;
and enforcement; and promotion of the development of inland fisheries. Ihis&#13;
would require strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff&#13;
training; stock assessment, and preparation and implementation of management&#13;
plans for marine and inland fisheries; improvement of extension in aquaculture,&#13;
including the use of improved quality fingerlings; establishment of a&#13;
Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) system for marine and inland&#13;
fisheries; and reform of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework in the sub-&#13;
sector to improve management, enhance private investment, and promote&#13;
sustainable catches of fish.&#13;
Benefits:          The main benefit of the project would be a major improvement in the&#13;
management of the fisheries resources which would lead to a recovery of the&#13;
fish stock. This, in turn, would allow for a sustainable increase in the&#13;
production of fish from the marine and inland fisheries; the long term biological&#13;
conservation, protection and sustainability of the resource; the prevention of&#13;
declines or collapses in fisheries production that would occur in the absence of&#13;
an appropriate and effective fisheries management regime; the improvement of&#13;
the economic efficiency, performance and profitability of the participants in the&#13;
fishery; and improvement in the institutional and policy frameworks for&#13;
sustainable development of the fisheries sub-sector.&#13;
RIUk:              'The main risks are financial (shortage of counterpart funds), institutional (the&#13;
DOF is weak relative to the task at hand and changes in management and&#13;
administrative processes and culture may not occur at the pace assumed), and&#13;
biological (the recovery of the fishery resources could be adversely affected by&#13;
unforeseen and uncontrollable environmental factors). Shortage of counterpart&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
funds is a general public finance problem that affects all the agricultural&#13;
portfolio, and Government has indicated that this is a short-term problem, that&#13;
it in no way implies the sector's low priority in the public investment program,&#13;
that it does not expect the problem to continue, and that it intends to allocate&#13;
the necessary counterpart resources in the coming budgets. Rectification of the&#13;
institutional capacity weaknesses is a major component of the project, and many&#13;
of the actions needed to strengthen the DOF will be implemented up-front. The&#13;
biological risks would be minimized through the environmental quality&#13;
enhancement aspects of the project design. The protection of spawning&#13;
grounds from fishing, enforcement of mesh and gear standards, and the banning&#13;
of use of traps and explosives in fishing, are designed to protect juveniles, and&#13;
to enhance recruitment and regeneration of the fishery. IDA and the Borrower&#13;
would conduct detailed annual reviews of implementation, where the focus&#13;
would be advance identification of problems and solution, including assessing&#13;
institutional capacity and prospects for counterpart funding.&#13;

Overview&#13;
I.1 Ghana is well endowed with natural resources, including arable land, forests, and sizable&#13;
mineral deposits of gold, diamonds, bauxite, and manganese, as well as some additional potential for&#13;
hydroelectric power. The economy has traditionally depended on primary production and exports of&#13;
cocoa and minerals. About 60 percent of the Ghanaian labor force is employed in agriculture.&#13;
Agricultural production is concentrated in staple food crops and cocoa. Ghana ranks among the&#13;
world's largest producers and exporters of cocoa. The service sector is the second largest employer-&#13;
over 25 percent of the labor force-accounting for over 40 percent of real GDP. It consists largely of&#13;
trade and public sector services. The industrial sector accounts for about 14 percont of GDP and&#13;
employment; it is relatively diverse sn well developed by Sub-Saharan African standards.&#13;
Performance&#13;
1.2 After a devastating economic performance throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the&#13;
Government introduced an Economic Recovery Prograrn (ERP) in 1983 in order to: (a) restore and&#13;
sustain macroeconomic stability, (b) improve the efficiency of public sector resource managemnt,&#13;
and (c) create an incentive framework to enhance efficiency, encourage savings and investmet, and&#13;
provide an enabling environment for private sector development.&#13;
1.3 The Government has been implementing a program of wide-ranging financial reforms. It has&#13;
abolished interest rate controls and sectoral credit ceilings, improved the legal framework governing&#13;
banidng activities, and introduced uniform accounting and auditing standards for al banks. The&#13;
central bank is strengthening the supervision of bank. A program to restructure the finces and&#13;
manaement of distressed banks has bon completed. The country has establishod a small stock&#13;
exchange, which is expected to be a vehicle for floating shares of public enterprises to be diveted.&#13;
1.4   Ghana now has a market-determined exchange rate system and a relatively low-tariff trade&#13;
regime, free of quantitative restrictions. In April 1990, the Govenment introduced an interbank&#13;
market supported by a weeldy wholesale auction of foreign exchange, with a view to encouraging&#13;
such transactions among banks. More than half the foreign exchange in the itrbank markut is&#13;
supplied by the Central Bank. Foreip exchange transactions at the bureau de change were also&#13;
legalized in 1990. The spread betwee the interbank foreip exchange market and the bureaus has&#13;
continued to fall, and is currently les than 10 percont. The Government abolshed the import&#13;
licensing system in 1989. Tariffs on imports have been reduced substWatially, ad excise taxes on&#13;
imports have been st at par with localy produced goods. Export tax", except for those on cocoa,&#13;
have boen abolished.&#13;
1.S  The Govermment hbs succeeded in mobilizing greaer public revenues through tax reorm,&#13;
improved tax collections, ad rationalization of consumption taxes and usr chag. Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
investment has grown from negligible levels at the beginning of the ERP to about 9 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1993, and the focus has changed from direct investment in productive activities to rehabilitation of&#13;
economic and social infrastructure, especially roads and human resources development. Tariff and&#13;
pricing policy in the power and energy sectors has also been improved. To better rationalize the&#13;
public investment program, the Ministry of Finance has established a committee, with representatives&#13;
from sector ministries, which coordinates investments and policies across sectors.&#13;
Prospects&#13;
1.6   Despite the successful impact of the ERP in restoring a healthy growth in the economy, the&#13;
poverty level has not improved significantly enough to raise the standard of living of the population,&#13;
generate robust demand for goods and services to trigger supply response, and lead to robust and&#13;
sustained rise in private savings and investment. The large civil service, which account for 70&#13;
percent of the national budget, and its consequences on macroeconomic stability continue to be of&#13;
concern. However, the Government is committed to continue the economic reform program,&#13;
maintain macroeconomic stability, restructure public service with a view to improving capacity to&#13;
manage public expenditure and investment, promote private sector development, invest in the&#13;
development of human resources and infrastructure, and accelerate the rate of economic growth as&#13;
means of also alleviating poverty quickly. Ghana is expected to reach a growth rate of 5.6 percent by&#13;
the turn of the century. More rapid growth can be achieved earlier if the Government can restore and&#13;
maintain macroeconomic balance more quickly, proceed expeditiously with privatization, improve&#13;
capacity in the public and private sectors, and accelerate investments in infrastructure and human&#13;
resources development. In the early years, most of the expected growth is likely to come from&#13;
agriculture, mining, financial services and transport. Higher manufacturing growth will follow with a&#13;
lag.&#13;
1.7   Though the Government has been making progress in restoring macroeconomic stability since&#13;
the election-related fiscal shock of 1992, the macroeconomic situation remains an issue. For more&#13;
than a decade, Ghana has undertaken sustained fiscal adjustment. However, in the run-up to the 1992&#13;
elections, public service wage increases and revenue slippage led to the re-emergence of large fiscal&#13;
deficits and increases in money supply. Although the fiscal situation improved significantly in 1993-&#13;
albeit not as much as planned-and the economy grew by 5 percent, inflation rose to 27 percent by&#13;
December 1993. Lower GDP growth in 1994-due to poor rains and civil conflict in the north-and&#13;
continued monetary expansion have prevented a decline in inflation by the end of 1994. Thus,&#13;
stabilization will be a key feature of the 1995 budget.&#13;
B. The Agricultural Sector&#13;
Intoduction&#13;
1.8   Agriculture remains the dominant sector of the Ghanaian economy, contributing nearly half of&#13;
the GDP and about three quarters of export earnings. It provides a livelihood for about 70 percent of&#13;
the population. The nascent industrial sector depends on agriculture as a source of raw materials.&#13;
Agriculture is a key source of public revenues and has an important impact on both public and private&#13;
savings. Food expenditures account for a significant component of household budgets and, hence,&#13;
agriculture has a significant influence on real wages, the rate of inflation, private savings and&#13;
investment, and overall macroeconomic performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.9 As in other sectors of the economy, the performance of the sector was poor prior to the&#13;
introduction of the ERP, with negative growth rates. Agriculture's growth rate improved after the&#13;
introduction of the ERP, although the 2 percent annual rate has lagged behind that of the economy as&#13;
a whole. The stage has, however, been set for an improved performance of the sector. The&#13;
Government has withdrawn from marketing of inputs and outputs. In the cocoa sub-sector, the&#13;
Government increased farm gate prices, which triggered a supply response from both replanting and&#13;
improved maintenance of existing trees. The Cocoa Board trimmed its operational expenses by&#13;
retrenching about 32,000 workers, which helped to finance the increased farm gate prices, and has&#13;
allowed competition by private traders in the marketing of the crop and of inputs. Those policy&#13;
measures, complemented by improved agricultural infrastructure and support services, and a stable&#13;
macroeconomic environment will be critical to improvement in the performance of the sector.&#13;
Characteristics of the Sector&#13;
1.10 Ghana's agriculture is predominantly smallholder, traditional, and rain-fed. The mean farm&#13;
size is about 1.6 ha. There is some degree of specialization by agro-ecological zones. For example,&#13;
tree crops tend to concentrate in the forest zones, livestock in savanna zones, and mixed cropping of&#13;
cereals and root crops are predominant in transitional zones. The common features, however, are the&#13;
use of bush fallow to restore soil fertility, mixed cropping to minimize risks, and widespread&#13;
integration of livestock into the farming systems. Land preparation and harvesting are done manualUy&#13;
in most places, and only very small proportion of the farmers use purchased inputs. Mechanization is&#13;
practiced only by a few commercial enterprises, and irrigated agriculture covers less than 10.000 ha.&#13;
The level of productivity is uniformly low by agricultural activities and agro-cological zones&#13;
throughout the country.&#13;
1.11 There are about 1.S million farm families. Women head 30 percent of the rural households,&#13;
and are responsible for about 70 percent of the total food production. The farmers are generally&#13;
market-oriented, but most of the production tends to be for subsistence due mainly to limited market&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
1.12 Root crops (dominated by cassava), plantain, and cocoyam account for about 55 percent of the&#13;
agricultural GDP. The balance is accounted for by industrial crops dominated by cocoa (15 percent),&#13;
cereals (7 percent), livestock (5 percent), fisheries (5 percent), and forestry, vegetables and&#13;
miscellaneous products (13 percent).&#13;
Growt Potential&#13;
1.13 The resource base for sustained growth is good, provided it is managed properly: large&#13;
untapped agricultural land, good forest and fisheries resources, low population density, good climate&#13;
that allows diverse agricultural activities year-round, and fairly literate and market orientod farming&#13;
population. The key to change lies in continued improvement in the competitiveness of the sector,&#13;
improvement of the incentive framework for expanding exports and import substitutes, accelerating&#13;
growth elsewhere in the economy to generate robust demand for agricultural products, and&#13;
strengthening the capacity of public institutions for policy formulation and implementation and for&#13;
managing properly the natural resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. The Fisheries Sub-Sector&#13;
'he Setting&#13;
1.14 Introduction. The fisheries sub-sector accounts for about 5 percent of the agricultural GDP&#13;
(value added of US$80 million at landing site and an equal amount generated by marketing and&#13;
processing); the Government can also earn substantial tax revenues from fishing activities, but that&#13;
potential has not yet been fully exploited. Fish is a preferred source of animal protein in Ghana, and&#13;
about 75 percent of the total production of fish is consumed domestically; the per capita consumption&#13;
is estimated at about 25 kg per annum (including about 35,000 tons of imports per year), representing&#13;
60 percent of the animal protein intake. Fish is the country's most important non-traditional export,&#13;
with an annual volume of about 30,000 tons earning about US$17 million. Some 500,000 fishers,&#13;
fish processors, traders, and boat builders and maintenance experts are employed in the industry;&#13;
these and their family members account for about 10 percent of the total population.&#13;
1.15 The sub-sector comprises a diverse and vigorous spectrum of fishing enterprises ranging in&#13;
scale from the subsistence to the industrial and exploiting fish stocks in rivers, lakes, coastal lagoons&#13;
and shallow seas, and offshore on the high seas up to the limits of the 200 mile Exclusive Economic&#13;
Zone (EEZ). The country has a coastline of about 550 km, and a narrow continental shelf (15-75&#13;
meter depth) with a total area of 24,300 km2 or 11 percent of the country's territorial waters. Inland&#13;
sources of fishing include 50 lagoons with a total area of 40,000 hectares, rivers, about 1,000 fish&#13;
farms, and lakes covering about one million hectares; the Volta Lake is the predominant one covering&#13;
about 900,000 hectares and with a shore-line of 5,000 km. The total fish catch from all sources&#13;
averaged about 335,000 tons per year over the last ten years, 85 percent of which was harvested from&#13;
marine and 15 percent from inland waters.&#13;
1.16 Marine Fisheries. The marine fisheries include tuna in offshore waters inside the EEZ and&#13;
beyond, and pelagic and demersal fish in the continental shelf area. Sardinellas, anchovy, and chub&#13;
mackerel are the most important small pelagic fish species. The most important demersal fish species&#13;
are of the families sparidae, pomadasidae, mullidae, sclaenidae, lutjanidae, serranidae, and&#13;
cephalopods.&#13;
1.17 The offshore waters, which yield about 10 percent of the total catch, are characterized by a&#13;
tuna fishery which extends to the high seas beyond Ghana's EEZ. Fishing is virtually all year round&#13;
by about 30 Ghanaian registered pole and line vessels targeting skipjack, yellow-fin and big-eye; some&#13;
70 percent of the catch is exported either for further processing or in canned/semi-processed form.&#13;
The management of the tuna resource is governed by the International Commission for the&#13;
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), of which Ghana is a member, and has recommended&#13;
increased harvest of skipjack since the supply is abundant in the Atlantic Ocean. There are no quotas&#13;
allocated to members of the ICCAT, Ghana has the right to increase the volume of catch as much as&#13;
the volume dictated by the market and physical capacity for fishing by the tuna fleet. There is, thus,&#13;
a good potential for expansion of tuna fishing.&#13;
1.18 'Me continental shelf is currently fished by three groups:&#13;
(a)    a fleet of some 8,700 traditional wooden dug-out or planked canoes, half of them&#13;
motorized, operating from nearly 200 fishing villages along the coastline; they account&#13;
for about 65 percent of the total volume of catch. The number of canoes, which is&#13;
4ense at 15 per km of the coast-line, has remained stable over the past 15 yars. lbe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
fishery operates for six days a week throughout the year, mainly targeting sardines and&#13;
anchovy. A variety of fishing gears are used including purse seines, ring and set nets,&#13;
respectively known locally as all, poli, and watsa. Demersal fin-fish species and&#13;
crustacea are also caught by the artisanal fishermen using various forms of bottom got&#13;
nets, gill and tangle nets;&#13;
(b)    a fleet of about three hundred diesel engine inshore vessels, which account for about 5&#13;
percent of the total catch. These use mainly light bottom trawls fitted without&#13;
mechanical aids, and became firmly established some years ago on the basis of good&#13;
catches of a semi-demersal trigger fish. This stock has largely disappeared in rect&#13;
years, and the sector is now in serious economic difficulty exacerbated by the&#13;
increasing cost of inputs, falling catch rates of the remaining demersal species, and&#13;
high debts. Increasing numbers of these vessels are now turning to purse seining in&#13;
competition with the canoe fishermen; and&#13;
(c)    a fleet of about forty large distant water freezer trawlers and shrimpers displaced from&#13;
their original fishing grounds in Angola, Namibia, Senegal and Mauritania because of&#13;
the extension of coastal state jurisdictions; they account for about 5 percent of the total&#13;
catch. The vessels are owned by private corporations and the State Fishing&#13;
Corporation, the latter of which has been divested. Tneir catches include a large&#13;
proportion of high value cephalopods, which are frozen at sea for export. The&#13;
industrial fleet is fishing illegally inside the 30 meter depth line using large nots whicb&#13;
scoop juvenile demersals, thus endangering the sustainability of the fisheries; the gean&#13;
used by the industrial fleet also destroy nets belonging to the artisanal fishermen&#13;
thereby creating more conflict. To compensate for the dwindling supply, the artisnal&#13;
and inshore fleet use larger nets and small-sized mesh, dynamite and chemicals, and in&#13;
the process are removing juvenile sardinella as well. The stiff competition and&#13;
extractive fishing practices have significantly reduced the stocks of some species and&#13;
catches per boat, and have pushed some of the fishermen to the point of financial&#13;
insolvency.&#13;
1.19 The statistics on the small pelagics are generally well kept, both at the national and regional&#13;
levels (there is close cooperation in small pelagic resource assessment among West African coastal&#13;
states, particularly between Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire). For small pelagic resources, the biomass&#13;
fluctuates significantly because of environmental factors. It is estimated, however, that the 1993 catch&#13;
of 180,000 tons is close to the maximum this fishery can sustain. The statistics on demersals are not&#13;
as reliable as those of the pelagics, but the available information indicates a maximum sustainable&#13;
yield of around 70,000 tons; actual catches have ranged up to 59,000 tons. Demersal resources on&#13;
trawable grounds appear to be excessively fished based on the evidence of declining catch per unit&#13;
effort; with appropriate management, the biomass of this fishery would recover leading to an increas&#13;
in the maximum sustainable catch. On untrawable grounds, the hand line fishery and bottom set net&#13;
fishing appear to operate at below the maximum sustainable yield. The maximum sustainable catch&#13;
of tuna in the Eastern Atlantic is estimated at 200,000 tons, about 40 percent of which is believed to&#13;
be in the Ghanaian waters; the actual catches by the Ghanaian fleet are around 35,000 tons compared&#13;
to a sustainable catch of some 80,000 tons.&#13;
1.20 Inad Fisheries. The commercially exploited resources in inland waters are mainly tilapia,&#13;
chrysithys, lates, alestes, eutropius, and schilbe. The potential yield from lake and river fisheries is&#13;
estimated at about 80,000 tons; present catches are about 60,000 tons. The Lake Volta is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
dominant source of inland catches, yielding about 40,000 tons per year; about 15,000 small planked&#13;
canoes fish on the Lake. There are also a number of fishing lagoons where fishing is done mainly for&#13;
subsistence. Aquaculture is currently not a significant source of fish production. There are now&#13;
about 1,000 farmers raising about 400 tons per year of tilapias and catfish on about 110 ha; 70&#13;
percent are in Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Eastern, and Western Regions, where costly transport of fresh&#13;
fish from the coastal fishing areas makes aquaculture viable. The technology used combines&#13;
fertilization of ponds by farm waste, and supplementary application of unformulated feedstuff, which&#13;
are mainly by-products from agro-industrial sources such as oil cakes, wheat and rice brans. There is&#13;
potential for further expansion of aquaculture, depending on its financial viability.&#13;
Public Sector Institutions&#13;
1.21 Department of Fisheries. The key public sector institution responsible for managing the&#13;
fisheries resources is the DOF of MOFA, whose activities were until recently focused on the&#13;
traditional roles of collecting statistical data, undertaking extension and development in the artisanal&#13;
fisheries and conducting research into the marine fish stocks. The Department has benefitted from&#13;
working with an industry which, in keeping with Ghana's strong union traditions, is well organized&#13;
into producer associations, and has accessed the fishing communities through well-developed systems&#13;
of traditional authority.&#13;
1.22 The DOF has its headquarters in Accra, a major branch in Tema, four regional and ten district&#13;
offices in the coastal areas. The office infrastructure at headquarters and the branches is generally in&#13;
good condition although a few need rehabilitation. The Department would need research vessels and&#13;
related technical equipment, computers and miscellaneous office equipment, a few additional vehicles&#13;
and motor cycles to be able to undertake sound stock assessment, monitor and enforce fisheries laws&#13;
and regulations, expand its extension activities, and disseminate information on the proper&#13;
management of the fish resources of the country.&#13;
1.23 The DOF is divided functionally into four branches: (a) Marine Fisheries, responsible for&#13;
coordinating statistics collection, extension, training and development work in the marine fisheries,&#13;
and for issuing fishing licenses; (b) Inland Fisheries, in charge of coordinating the collection of&#13;
market data, stock assessment on inland fisheries, provision of extension services to fishing&#13;
communities in inland areas, management of capture fisheries, and promotion of aquaculture&#13;
development; (c) Fisheries Research and Utilization Branch, which is responsible for undertaking&#13;
stock assessment and biological studies, monitoring oceanographic phenomena, and conducting&#13;
research and development in fishing gear in marine fisheries; and (d) Administration and&#13;
Operations Branch, in charge of accounts, personnel matters, monitoring of fishing operations and&#13;
marketing activities, and administration of donor-funded programs in the sub-sector. There are about&#13;
480 employees including professionals, technical staff, tradespeople (engineers and vessel crew), and&#13;
support and clerical staff.&#13;
1.24 The competencies of the few professional staff are of good standard, and the DOF has been&#13;
able to attract good caliber staff partly due to popular appreciation of the fisheries profession.&#13;
However, continuous training of staff would be essential to more effectively respond to the emerging&#13;
role of the public institutions in management, monitoring, control, surveillance, extension services,&#13;
and promotion of community participation in the management of the fisheries resources.&#13;
1.25 Fisheries Commission. In 1993, the Government established a Fisheries Commission (FC) for&#13;
regulating and managing the utilization of the fishery resources, coordinating policies, prescribing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
standards for fishery products, coordinating international collaboration in fisheries, liaising with the&#13;
industry and other public and private bodies, and advising the Minister of Food and Agriculture on all&#13;
matters pertaining to the sub-sector. Membership of the Commission, appointed by the Head of&#13;
State, includes representatives of the fishing industry associations; MOFA; Ministries of Transport&#13;
and Communications, Defense, and Enviromnent; Institute of Aquatic Biology (IAB); the Ghana&#13;
Irrigation Development Authority; and four representatives of financial institutions and traden.&#13;
1.26 Department of Extension. This department of the MOFA is responsible for all agricultural&#13;
extension services, except cocoa which continues to be handled by the Cocoa Board. The&#13;
incorporation of fish farming extension into the unified extension system has met with varying degree&#13;
of success. The primary value of the front line extension agents is that they are mobile and in close&#13;
touch with the farming communities. They are, therefore, best placed to advise farners on the&#13;
potential for aquaculture in their areas, and to communicate demand for more specialized technical&#13;
services to the Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) in the DOF. It is not considered feasible to train&#13;
front line staff in the disciplines of site selection or pond design, which should be left to the&#13;
technicians, but is realistic to expect them, after suitable training, to recognize areas of high potential&#13;
and to screen out areas or holdings which do not have the basic requirements for fish farming. The&#13;
Department of Extension is adequately funded to enable regular training sessions to be conducted by&#13;
the SMSs from the DOF, although current activities in this area are inadequate. Therefore, the&#13;
unified extension service should prove an effective vehicle for aquaculture extension.&#13;
Private Sector Institutions&#13;
1.27 The fishing enterprises are represented by producer organizations which represent&#13;
consolidations of less coherent regional associations that have evolved with the industry. Tbey&#13;
continue to function without further Government assistance, fulfilling important roles in representing&#13;
the views of their membership to Government and to other sectors of the industry, and in the case of&#13;
the artisanal fishers' association, in organizing access to imported inputs and credit. Two women's&#13;
organizations (the National Council for Women, and Development and the 31st December Women's&#13;
Movement) are active in the promotion of new fish processing technology.&#13;
1.28 Fishing villages have traditional systems of governance, with the Chief Fisherman at the bhlm&#13;
for the men and a  onkoQhen for the women; both are essential for the management of anl&#13;
fishing. The Chief Fisherman is generally a powerful, well-respected and technically competeat&#13;
member of the fishing community who has special responsibilities to settle disputes, mediate with&#13;
migrant fishers, coordinate action in the event of accidents at sea, supervise the fair distribution of&#13;
any communally acquired inputs, and participates in religious rituals connected with the sea. He is&#13;
assisted by a Council of senior fishers and receives revenues to support his office through the&#13;
imposition of levies in kind at the landing beaches. In processing and trading, the female traditiiona&#13;
authority is elected by elders in the fish trade, is assisted in her office by a Council, and imposes&#13;
levies on traded fish. Her functions include representing the women in negotiations to set the daily&#13;
prices of fish, the settlement of disputes in the fish trade, and leads in other traditional activities. Tbe&#13;
two leaders co-exist and generally work together for the mutual benefits of their membes.&#13;
1.29 The fishers generally believe that resources are inexhaustible, fluctuations in yield are caused&#13;
by natural phenomenon and not by their actions, fishing should be accessible to all from within their&#13;
group, and that there should not be any Government restriction or interference in fishing activities.&#13;
The artisanal fishers, however, are inclined to obey rules issued by the traditionl authorities i the&#13;
fishing villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Markets and Marketing&#13;
1.30 The prospects for the domestic and export market are good. A combination of rising&#13;
population and income, and well established external market for tuna with operations by a major&#13;
importer (Star Kist Foods of U.S.A.) should continue to provide a firm market base. An expanding&#13;
population alone would increase the domestic demand by about 80,000 tons per year by the turn of&#13;
the century.&#13;
1.31 Marketing of fish is in the hands of numerous private traders, who operate by the laws of the&#13;
market unencumbered by state interference. Fish landed by canoes and the inshore fleet is sold&#13;
immediately to the fishers' wives, relatives, or agents, who, together with their fishmongers, do all&#13;
the handling, processing, and marketing. Some of the fish is sold directly to consumers at the landing&#13;
sites, but the bulk of it is smoked, sun-dried, or salted by the fish-mongers who buy directly from the&#13;
marketing agents. There has been a lot of improvement in the technologies of fishing handling,&#13;
preservation, processing, and distribution. The processed fish, which can remain in good condition&#13;
for about six months, is packed into cane baskets or wooden boxes and conveyed to markets in most&#13;
parts of the country. The fishmongers have their agents in these markets and the agents take care of&#13;
sales to consumers. Cured fish is also exported to neighboring countries by the fishmongers. The&#13;
demersals landed by the deep sea fleet are sold to agents at Tema, who freeze and sell them to&#13;
fishmonger for processing and marketing. The domestic marketing system functions fairly well, and&#13;
market signals are correctly transmitted in a timely fashion through the marketing chain.&#13;
Eishing Infrastructure&#13;
1.32 The Tema and outer fishing harbors offer the only sheltered berthing and landing facilities for&#13;
fishing vessels over 10 meters in length. There are only 210 meters of quay to accommodate landing&#13;
of fish and lay-by berths. The use of the facilities is hampered by a number of sunken and&#13;
inoperative vessels. Furthermore, the depth of much of the harbor at the quay is inadequate for the&#13;
largest vessels drawing 6.5 meters of water. The harbor at Takoradi provides limited use for large&#13;
fishing vessels, inshore vessels and canoes. There is also a small port for the inshore fleet at Elmina.&#13;
1.33 The Tema Shipyard and Drydock Corporation provides dry-docking and repair facilities for&#13;
large fishing vessels, and the Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority operates slip-ways in Tema and&#13;
Sekondi. A private firm (Mankoadze Fisheries Limited) operates a comprehensive engineering&#13;
workshop and foundry for all kinds of repair work. Other repair facilities include outboard motor&#13;
mechanics who usually operate from the fishing towns. There are three major boat-building&#13;
enterprises in Tema, Sekondi, and Mumford compared to over a dozen a decade ago; shortage of&#13;
skills, high cost of materials, and low demand have contributed to the decline in the number.&#13;
1.34 There are about 300 landing sites for artisanal fishers, but these are not sufficiently developed.&#13;
For the most part, the boats operate from open beaches and have to cross in and out through violent&#13;
surf. Canoes are often damaged severely as they attempt to land in the violent surf. Getting the&#13;
boats from their moorings on the beach into the sea for the outward journey and back again after the&#13;
return trip is also back-breaking.&#13;
The Leial Framework&#13;
1.35 Current fisheries legislation is embodied in the Fisheries Law of 1991 (PNDCL 256), and the&#13;
Fisheries Commission Act of 1993 (Act 457). Ibese describe the framework for: the construction or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
importation of fishing craft; the licensing and registration of fishing craft (including canoes),&#13;
conditions for licensing, scale of license fees and of fines for failure to license, grounds for revocation&#13;
or refusal to renew a license and appeals procedures; the manning of fishing vessels, including&#13;
competency and certification of crews; the seaworthiness of fishing craft; the carriage of log books;&#13;
specification of fishing zones, the regulation of mesh sizes in trawl, seine, purse seine, set and drift&#13;
net fisheries, the prohibition of gears or the restriction of gears to specific zones, the protection of&#13;
young or gravid lobsters and the imposition of closed seasons; the marking of all fishing craft and&#13;
submerged gears; the transhipment and export of tuna; the import and export of live fish; penalties for&#13;
offenses; the establishment, functions and powers of a Monitoring, Control, Surveillance and&#13;
Enforcement system (which has not yet been established); and the establishment and functions of a FC&#13;
and a Fisheries Development Fund.&#13;
1.36 The fisheries legislation is deficient in five principal areas: (a) there is no clear assigmnent of&#13;
responsibility for fisheries management, control, surveillance, and enforcement. The diffusion of&#13;
responsibilities between the DOF and FC creates confusion about the authority and responsibility for&#13;
the management of the fisheries resources, and exacerbates the problems of policy formulation and&#13;
implementation, and the enforcement of fisheries laws. It is not essential to have both institutions for&#13;
managing the sub-sector; (b) the power of the Government to restrict the size of the catcb (e.g.&#13;
through the imposition of a Total Allowable Catch or TAC), the power to impose a Minimum&#13;
Landing Size or MLS (which has proven to be useful in inland waters for the protection of valuable&#13;
fisheries for low-fecundity cichlid species and is usually considered an essential tool for the&#13;
management of the marine spicy lobster fishery), an explicit power to control fishing effort (e.g. by&#13;
restricting entry into the fishery) have been omitted; (c) no clear distinction is made between inland&#13;
and marine fisheries, and between artisanal and industrial fisheries, thus failing to appreciate the&#13;
fundamental differences among them; (d) fairly precise mesh sizes are prescribed in the Law and&#13;
towed gear is prohibited within the 30 meter contour without much scientific basis. Such&#13;
prescriptions ought rather be treated in the regulations for ease of modifying them in the light of&#13;
changing scientific evidence and management needs; and (e) some of the provisions which are&#13;
included in the Law (such as minimum mesh size, observations of safety regulations interdiction of&#13;
moveable gear inside the 30 meter contour) are not enforced.&#13;
Public ExDenditures and Revenues in the Sub-Sector&#13;
1.37 The fisheries sub-sector is dominated by the private sector. In the past, the public sector was&#13;
heavily involved in direct investment in capture fisheries through the State Fishing Corporation, but&#13;
Government has scaled down its direct investment and currently holds only a minority share in&#13;
privately owned corporations. The focus of the public sector now is in the provision of support&#13;
services (extension, research, market intelligence, and export promotion), formulation of policies that&#13;
enhance the private sector, enforcement of laws and regulations affecting the sub-sector, and&#13;
divestiture of State Fishing Corporation. This shift in policy has reduced the total public sectr&#13;
expenditure in the sub-sector.&#13;
1.38 Over the past five years, public expenditure in the sub-sector, consisting of budgetary&#13;
allocation to the DOF, hovered around US$500,000 per year. About 70 percent was used to finance&#13;
staff salaries and benefits, 10 percent for travel, and only 20 percent for all other expenses including&#13;
maintenance of buildings, purchases, operation and maintenance of equipment, investment in&#13;
aquaculture, and data processing. The share of expenditures on salaries and benefits has teDded to&#13;
increase, while the proportion of expenditure on other activities has tended to decline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
1.39 The Government collects revenues from fishers and fish importers, which in the past amounted&#13;
to an equivalent of about 70 percent of the public expenditures in the sub-sector. Sources of the&#13;
revenues include: (a) a Fisheries Development Fund, an account within MOFA, which was&#13;
introduced in 1993. The only current source of deposit into the Fund is a special levy imposed on&#13;
imported fish. The levy is only 10 cedis/kg; (b) license fees levied on the industrial and semi-&#13;
industrial fisheries at the rate of 0.1 percent of the value of catch at the first point of sale. Total&#13;
collections ranged between US$20,000 and US$45,000 per year in the past five years; (c) revenues&#13;
from the sale of fingerlings and fisheries inputs averaging around US$3,000 per year; and (d)&#13;
insignificant fines on fishers for violations of regulations.&#13;
Prospects&#13;
1.40 Substantial production increases are possible in the export-oriented tuna fisheries, and a&#13;
vigorous effort by the private sector would need to be made to achieve this. The highly valuable&#13;
demersal stocks closer in-shore are being over-fished. With appropriate management, these stocks&#13;
can recover and some expansion beyond the current catch level is possible. In addition, some&#13;
expansion of catch of demersal species, crustaceans, and shrimps in deeper water is possible. The&#13;
long-term biological limit and maximum sustainable catch of small pelagics can not be realistically&#13;
predicted because the fisheries have limited longevity, are prone to high mortality, and the biomass is&#13;
subject to extreme fluctuations due to changes in hydro-climatic conditions. The potential increase in&#13;
the inland fishery is very modest. There is some potential for an expansion of the fishery in Lake&#13;
Volta. The prospects for aquaculture development, which depend on the financial viability of&#13;
investment in pond construction and maintenance, appear to be promising. Systematic efforts need to&#13;
be made to develop technologies which could improve the viability of the operations.&#13;
D. Government's Development Strategy&#13;
1.41 The potential for and need to accelerate agricultural growth were the underlying themes of a&#13;
rolling Medium-Term Agricultural Development Strategy (MTADS), formulated by the Government&#13;
with assistance from IDA in 1990. The MTADS examined the main constraints to sector growth and&#13;
set out strategic objectives to address them. The identified constraints were: poorly organized and&#13;
managed agricultural support services, neglected rural infrastructure particularly feeder roads, weak&#13;
capacity of public sector institutions for managing the sector, over-exploitation of natural resources&#13;
exacerbated by inadequate public sector capacity for formulating and enforcing appropriate policy,&#13;
and adverse public sector interference in marketing and pricing of inputs and outputs. The&#13;
development priorities were: setting clear objectives in research, extension, animal and plant disease&#13;
control, strengthening institutions to provide these services and to regulate natural resource use,&#13;
concentrating on low-level infrastructure and decentralizing investment decisions to respond more&#13;
rapidly to the needs of rural communities, increasingly relying on the private sector for the marketing&#13;
of inputs and outputs, improving the policy framework to promote exports of agricultural products,&#13;
and promoting sustainable and environmentally-friendly use of natural resources. A target growth&#13;
rate of 4 percent per annum was established as a benchmark. This target was considered the&#13;
maximum achievable, given the record of the past where traditional production methods are slow to&#13;
change, and poor farmers' inherent tendency to risk aversion.&#13;
1.42 In the fisheries sub-sector, Governmnent objectives are to increase production for local&#13;
consumption and export, consistent with the long-term sustainability of the resource, develop resource&#13;
management plans for the entire fisheries sector, integrate fishing activities in the farming system&#13;
througb the promotion of aquaculture, privatize assets and operations of public bodies oigaged in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
direct fishing or in the supply of fishing gear, and strengthen the fisheries department so that it can&#13;
effectively carry out its mandate, particularly relating to the above tasks. In order to attain these&#13;
objectives, the Government intends to undertake the following reforms, programs and projects: (a)&#13;
pursue a private sector oriented strategy and divest public sector commercial assets and concerns; (b)&#13;
remove policy bottlenecks to increased exploitation of tuna resources and promote private investment&#13;
in rehabilitation and expansion of the tuna fleet, so as to increase exports; (c) promote, through&#13;
extension and other support services, private smallholder investment in aquaculture, especially in the&#13;
hinterland; (d) promote joint ventures between Ghanaian and foreign investors in trawl fishing so a&#13;
to obtain foreign fishing rights for the Ghanaian trawler fleet and stop its over-exploitation of in-shore&#13;
demarsal fisheries; (e) rationalize exploitation of both marine and lake fisheries resources, through&#13;
stock assessment surveys and comprehensive management plans, aimed at harvesting various specie&#13;
only up to the maximum sustainable yield in order to prevent the possible collapse of critical fisherie&#13;
and increase exploitation of under-utilized resources; (f) update the fisheries law so as to facilitate a&#13;
regulatory framework in which the fisheries management plan would be effectively carried out; and&#13;
(g) strengthen the DOF and related institutions and fishers' groups so they can effectively implement&#13;
the fisheries management plans, including monitoring, control and surveillance.&#13;
1.43 All subsidies to fishing inputs have been removed, including the subsidy to the premix fuel for&#13;
canoe fishers. The State Fishing Corporation, the largest state commercial concern in the sector, has&#13;
been privatized, and its eight ships have been sold.&#13;
1.44 Government would continue to encourage the private sector to increase the catch and export of&#13;
tuna. the tuna industry has been constrained by low world market prices, which are now beginning&#13;
to recover, and insufficient credit in the face of low cash positions of the tuna companies. The&#13;
recovery of international prices and resumption of tuna processing by the USA-based Star Kist&#13;
corporation, which buys the tuna from Ghanaian vessels, has begun to restore profitability to some&#13;
enterprises. Govermment will promote joint ventures and investment in local tuna processing and&#13;
canning enterprises.&#13;
1.45 For the non-tuna industrial fleet, Government policy would focus on removing the trawler fleet&#13;
to the outer sea, where under-exploited resources are available. A key element of this policy will be&#13;
the enforcement of fisheries laws and regulations relating to fishing restrictions in the continental&#13;
shelf. The in-shore fishing enterprises are at present experiencing financial distress, aggravated by&#13;
depletion of the inshore fisheries. Government strategy will focus on relief in the medium-erm&#13;
through enforcement of the 30 meter exclusion of large trawlers and implementation of fisheries&#13;
management plan aimed at restoring the demersal stock. In inland fishing, Government intends to&#13;
carry out stock assessments, prepare a management plan and continuously monitor its implementation.&#13;
Aquaculture and other fisheries in the smaller inland water bodies offer an opportunity to improve&#13;
nutrition in the hinterland and increase incomes of the small farmer in the context of the mixed&#13;
integrated fish/crop/livestock activities. Government intends to promote aquaculture through research&#13;
in appropriate husbandry, and farmer education in the framework of MOFA's unified extension.&#13;
1.46 The above-outlined Government development strategy for the fisheries sub-sector is&#13;
summarized in the Government's Letter of Sub-Sector Policy (Annex 15).&#13;
E. EDA's Assistance StrategD&#13;
1.47 IDA support for agriculture in recent years has been fully consistent with the priorities sot out&#13;
in the MTADS. Since 1990, there have been six new IDA operations in agriculture, one Sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Adjustment Credit concerned with the withdrawal of the State from marketing and input supply; three&#13;
credits supporting agricultural services in the public sector (Research, Extension, and Livestock); one&#13;
credit supporting public institutions charged with regulating and managing natural resources&#13;
(Environment); and one credit supporting decentralized investment in rural infrastructure (Agricultural&#13;
Sector Investment). IDA has also supported complementary investment in national feeder roads&#13;
improvement program. To-date, agriculture had accounted for about 11 percent of the cumulative&#13;
Bank Group lending to Ghana.&#13;
1.48 IDA's support for the agricultural sector over the next few years will be fully consistent with&#13;
the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). IDA would continue to work closely with the&#13;
Government to improve the implementation performance of the on-going portfolio, and the&#13;
performance would have significant impact on the design of new lending programs. In addition to the&#13;
proposed project, three new operations are planned in the agricultural sector over the next few years:&#13;
a Sector Adjustment Credit, a Wildlife Resources Management Project, and a second Forestry&#13;
Resources Management Project.&#13;
F. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.49 The proposed project is fully consistent with the CAS, and is specifically mentioned in the&#13;
CAS that was discussed by the Board on April 14, 1994. The CAS emphasized capacity building,&#13;
private sector led development, improved management of natural resources and the environment, and&#13;
support to programs that have short life spans and that are locally generated and owned. The focus of&#13;
the proposed project would be institutional strengthening and policy reform to improve management&#13;
of a key natural resource, and to enhance private sector investment in the fisheries sub-sector. The&#13;
project would have a short life span of five years. The proposed project was developed by the&#13;
Government with active participation of implementing agencies (para. 2.1), and taking account of&#13;
lessons learned from previous operations; that process ensured high quality at entry.&#13;
1.50 The proposed project would complement IDA's previous support for complementary activities&#13;
in livestock and agricultural support services. Despite the good potential for development of both&#13;
marine and inland fisheries, the sub-sector had not received previously adequate funding under the&#13;
public investment program. The Government is now committed to realizing that potential by&#13;
encouraging private investment, improving the policy and regulatory framework, and strengthening&#13;
the institutional framework for public support services. In order to maintain the predominantly&#13;
private sector nature of the fisheries sub-sector, Government interventions would be confined to the&#13;
provision of support services such as extension, research, surveillance of both foreign and domestic&#13;
fishers, improved legal and regulatory framework, and infrastructure. This way, the foundation&#13;
would be built for attaining the long-term potential of the sub-sector, improving the productivity and&#13;
incomes of the large number of fishers and women traders and processors, and diversifying the export&#13;
base.&#13;
G. Lessons From Previous Operations&#13;
Ghana Portfolio&#13;
1.51  The 1994 Annual Portfolio Performance Review indicated the following main difficulties In&#13;
Ghana: weak management and project implementation capacity, procurement delays, inadequate&#13;
and/or untimely release of counterpart funds, and inefficient donor coordination. The main focus of&#13;
the proposed project would be to prioritize the role of the public sector institutions in fisheries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
development, taking account of the limited human and financial resources, improve the capacity of the&#13;
public sector institutions for planning and implementing the priority activities, and improve the data&#13;
base and regulatory framework for monitoring developments in the sub-sector. The design would,&#13;
therefore, be simple with sharply defined objectives. Use of standard bidding documents would be&#13;
mandatory under the proposed project, and that would avoid delays in procurement; detailed&#13;
procurement schedules would be prepared for all items to be financed under the project and were&#13;
agreed during negotiations. Unlike other sub-sectors, there are only a few donors involved in the&#13;
fisheries sub-sector (mainly Denmark, Germany, and UNDP), and there are no problems of donor&#13;
coordination.&#13;
1.52 IDA's only experience in the fisheries sub-sector in Ghana was through a FY70 Fisheries&#13;
Project (Credit 163-GH), which included construction of fishing vessels, consultant services to&#13;
manage the construction, credit to fishermen to purchase the vessels, and studies on fisheries and port&#13;
development. The project was not considered a success. It was poorly designed; it had no&#13;
institutional development objective; appraisal was done without sufficient basic information on fish&#13;
resources; the studies were not useful since they were beset with disagreements among the Borrower,&#13;
the consultant and IDA; and it was not supervised properly. Lessons learnt from this project have&#13;
been incorporated in the preparation of the proposed project.&#13;
Bank Group's Support for Fisheries Elsewhere&#13;
1.53  The Bank Group has so far financed 35 free-standing fisheries projects and a further 60&#13;
fisheries components of agricultural projects in 40 countries, including 13 countries in Sub-Sahara&#13;
Africa. Total cost of the projects supported was US$1.4 billion, and the Bank Group financing was&#13;
US$600 million. The fisheries programs included improvement of fishing port and harbor facilities,&#13;
boat-yards, workshops, access roads, fuel depots, and water supply facilities; construction of&#13;
processing, storage, and other marketing facilities and of fish ponds and hatcheries; purchases of&#13;
fishing vessels and gear for use by private fishermen; and technical assistance and training.&#13;
1.54 About half of the projects completed achieved their intended objectives. The rest had suffered&#13;
severe cost over-runs, delays in completion, did not result in strengthened fisheries institutions, and&#13;
had poor records of credit repayment. The problems stemmed from technical and administrative&#13;
weaknesses in the implementing agencies, and from the Bank Group's limited fisheries expertise and&#13;
technical input during the process of design, appraisal, and supervision. Similar problems continue to&#13;
plague the existing portfolio.&#13;
1.55 The key lessons are: design projects to fit the capacity of implementing agencies; focus public&#13;
investment in capacity building and infrastructure that would enhance private sector activities;&#13;
promote good management practices by empowering beneficiaries; improve the statistical, legal,&#13;
regulatory, and policy framework to promote sustainable fishing; avoid public sector investment in&#13;
activities that can best be undertaken by the private sector; strengthen research and extension services;&#13;
promote close linkages between fisheries and other sub-sectors of agriculture; and generate&#13;
investment/lending programs after thorough sub-sector reviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. TilE PROJE&#13;
A. Inroduction&#13;
2.1   The project was identified and prepared by the Government. In June 1993, the Government&#13;
organized a national workshop on the fisheries sub-sector to review the development potential and&#13;
constraints, arLd to reach a consensus on a broad development strategy. Following the workshop, a&#13;
Fisheries Sub-Sector Development Strategy through the turn of this century was prepared, which was&#13;
used as a basis for preparing the proposed project. The Government appointed a team of local&#13;
consultants to prepare the project, who consulted extensively with farmers, associations of fishers,&#13;
traders, professionals from various agriculture-related institutions, NGOs, and donors in the course of&#13;
formulating the project. An FAO team helped the Government in finalizing the preparation, and a&#13;
final preparation report was submitted to IDA at the end of May 1994.&#13;
B. Protect Rationale &amp; Design Criteria&#13;
2.2   The fisheries sub-sector needs urgent attention to resolve a variety of problems accumulated&#13;
over decades of neglect. The most prominent of the problems are decline in the stock of fish, the&#13;
proliferation of demersal trawling effort in the near-shore waters all competing for and extracting the&#13;
dwindling supply of stock, absence of an active management regime, weak institutional and legal&#13;
frameworks for effectively managing the fisheries resources, and a growing financial crisis in the&#13;
industry as the heavy investments by the numerous fishers now become unprofitable due to the&#13;
declining resource and rising cost.&#13;
2.3   Classical marine fisheries management tools (restricting entry, closed seasons and areas,&#13;
miunimum mesh sizes, quota arrangement, minimum fish sizes), can only be applied with limits in&#13;
Ghana in a fishery dominated by a large number of artisanal fishermen, holding traditional beliefs and&#13;
in the presence of some fishing stocks of which the biomass is largely unaffected by human effort.&#13;
Under present circumstances, conventional management appears most suitable to deal with distant&#13;
water trawlers and shrimpers, and the semi-industrial inshore vessels.&#13;
2.4   The demersal stocks can recover under an appropriate conventional management, and the&#13;
inshore and canoe fisheries would benefit if the extractive industrial trawler fishing is controlled on&#13;
the continental shelf. For the artisanal fishery, the preferred management option is to improve the&#13;
data base and general information on effort and participants, introduce some gear controls, and&#13;
monitor it closely while establishing trust and cooperation with the traditional authorities to promote&#13;
community-based rational management.&#13;
2.5   The organization and legal framework for the management of the fisheries resources are weak,&#13;
and need to be strengthened. Fundamental measures for fishery management are omitted entirely&#13;
from legislation which defines neither the responsibilities of the DOF nor the rights and powers of its&#13;
officers. The administrative framework for the fisheries sub-sector evolved in a context of expansion&#13;
and rapid technological development in the artisanal fisheries, and of comparable growth in an&#13;
industrial fleet acquired to exploit offshore resources throughout the West African sub-region. This&#13;
has not changed. Toe loss of distant water opportunities, the parallel dramatic increase in fishing&#13;
presure on domestic stocks, and the severe erosion of profitability in the artisanrl and inshore&#13;
fthsries In recent years require a major shift in emphasis of administration away from promotion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
extractive fishing and towards pro-active management for sustainable production. The challenge in&#13;
the years ahead will be to build knowledge and a policy-making capability in the fisheries&#13;
administration to allow it to formulate and implement fully informed management decisions which&#13;
meet with the largest possible national consensus.&#13;
2.6   Other design criteria include: assigning fisheries management responsibilities and executive&#13;
powers to only one institution, and avoiding the proliferation of institutions and overlapping&#13;
responsibilities; minimizing the impact of the project on the public expenditure program; ensuring&#13;
consistency with the ERP; promoting private sector participation in implementing the project through&#13;
contractual arrangements; involving the project beneficiaries in the design and implementation of the&#13;
project; and ensuring consistency with sector development strategy and other public investment&#13;
programs in the agricultural sector.&#13;
C. Project Objectives and Components&#13;
2.7   The key objective of the project is to establish the long-term sustainability of the fisheries&#13;
resource and thereby maximize its contribution to the economy. To achieve this objective, the project&#13;
would build the capacity of the DOF for managing the sub-sector, focusing on capacity for:&#13;
formulating policy and management plans and their implementation; monitoring, control, surveillance,&#13;
and enforcement; and promoting the development of inland fisheries. This would involve:&#13;
(a)    strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff training,&#13;
(b)    stock assessment, and preparation and implementation of management plans for marinm&#13;
and lake fisheries,&#13;
(c)    strengthening of extension in aquaculture,&#13;
(d)    establishment of MCS system for marine and inland fisheries, and&#13;
(e)    reform of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework in the sub-sector to improve&#13;
management, enhance private investment, and promote sustainable catches of fish.&#13;
D. Det idFalre&#13;
Strenrthening of the DOF (USS5 million)&#13;
2.8  The DOF would be re-organized to give prominence to resource management functions, avoid&#13;
ambiguities among units, improve efficiency in the utilization of human and material resources, more&#13;
clearly define authority and accountability, and improve professional job satisfaction. This would&#13;
involve three existing divisions (Marine Fisheries Research, Inland Fisheries Management, and&#13;
Administration), and two new divisions (Marine Fisheries Management, and MCS). Fifteen&#13;
additional professional staff would need to be assigned including eleven for the new MCS Division,&#13;
and one economist and one sociologist each for the Marine and Inland Fisheries Management&#13;
Divisions. The total complement of staff would still be within the approved civil service staffing limit&#13;
for the DOF of 521. The present and projected staffing of the DOF is shown in Annex 1.&#13;
2.9 Tbe project would strengthen the capacity of the DOP in financial management, including dbo&#13;
coUlection and management of fisheries levies, improved accounting and control of developmeot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
funds, and proper budget planning and management. The department would need to increase the&#13;
levies and more aggressively collect them, which would help finance the anticipated increase of public&#13;
services to the industry. So far, the industry has not been making substantial financial contributions.&#13;
The only contribution has been in the form of license fees charged to only the mechanized fleet; the&#13;
canoe fleets, which account for the major share of total catch, are not charged. Even the levies on&#13;
the mechanized fleet are insignificant, amounting to only 0.1 percent of the catch.&#13;
2.10 The project would finance: technical assistance to help improve financial control and&#13;
management (65 person-months to be recruited locally); training of staff (focusing on extension&#13;
methods, marketing with emphasis on post-harvest technology, aquaculture and reservoir fish culture&#13;
techniques, and fisheries resources management, fisheries economics, monitoring, control, and&#13;
surveillance); rehabilitation of the DOF's offices at headquarters and branches, and construction of&#13;
new ones; monitoring and evaluating the project; vehicles, and office equipment and supplies; and&#13;
incremental operating expenses. The training program for the first year is discussed in Annex 2.&#13;
This component would account for 47 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
2.11  As a condition of effectveness the Borrower shall assign the following key professional staff&#13;
to DOF: eleven MCS personnel, two economists, two sociologists, and at least one accountant on&#13;
terms and conditions which shall be satisfactory to IDA at all times (para. 5.1 (a)). Assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that the Borrower shall: (a) not later than September 30 of each year,&#13;
prepare and submit to IDA, for its review and comment, an annual training program covering the&#13;
period twelve months commencing on the following January 1, and make such revisions to such&#13;
training program as may be appropriate, and except as IDA shall otherwise agree, carry out training&#13;
on the basis of such annual training programs (para. 5.2 (a)), and (b) submit to Parliament, not later&#13;
than June 30, 1996, a revised fisheries legislation that shall be acceptable to IDA (para. 5.2 (b)).&#13;
Marine Fisheries Management (USS2.2 million)&#13;
2.12 The project would support demersal and pelagic stocks assessment; the statistics for tuna are&#13;
generally satisfactory. Tne demersal assessment would be done through trawling trials and catch&#13;
evaluation, supplemented by logbook inspections, weighing samples at quay-side, surveillance&#13;
information and inspections of catch to obtain a more complete picture of the industrial catch. The&#13;
pelagic stock assessment would be done through acoustic surveys. The well established shore-based&#13;
statistical system for the artisanal fleet would be continued, but this would be intensified through more&#13;
frequent updating of the frame survey, aerial census, registration of canoes, and improvement of the&#13;
quality of industrial fisheries statistics. Information on the stock of fish would be used to prepare&#13;
management plans and their periodic updating; the management plans for the artisanal fishery are&#13;
expected to focus on promotion of community-based management through the traditional leadership&#13;
structure with enforcement of laws and regulations to be used for support and reinforcement of&#13;
traditional authority. Details are in Annex 3.&#13;
2.13 The project would flnance the rehabilitation of an existing Ghanaian research vessel, which on&#13;
previous occasions has been used for stock assessment, to extend its useful life by about ten years;&#13;
cost of contracting the acoustic surveys; vehicles, and technical and office equipment; 12 person-&#13;
months of internationally recruited technical assistance to help in preparing management plans; and&#13;
incremental operating expenses. This component would account for 21 percent of the total project&#13;
cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.14 During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Borrower shall: (a) remove from inside&#13;
the 30 meter depth line all trawlers in excess of 50 gross registered tonnage not later than June 30,&#13;
1996 (para. 5.2 (c)), (b) complete the registration of the canoe fleet not later than December 31, 1996&#13;
(para. 5.2 (d)), (c) (i) ensure that levies on all vessels other than the canoe fleet have been increased&#13;
to the equivalent of one percent of the gross landed value of catch by not later than June 30, 1997,&#13;
(ii) by June 30, 1998 review the experience with the initial increase including, in   j, the adequacy&#13;
of the levies and their impact on the industry, (iii) furnish the recommendations of said review to IDA&#13;
for review and comments, and (iv) implement said recommendations taking into account IDA's&#13;
comments (para. 5.2 (e)), and (d) submit to IDA not later than December 31, 1996 a strategy for&#13;
implementing appropriate fisheries management plans (para. 5.2 (f).&#13;
Inland Fisheries Management (USS1.5 million)&#13;
2.15 The project would support improved management and development of lake fisheries through&#13;
stock assessment and promotion of community-based management of fisheries resources in lakes,&#13;
initially focusing on Lake Volta; and the expansion of aquaculture through strengthened extension in&#13;
aquaculture. The extension package would include: site selection, choice of species for pond culture,&#13;
stocking densities, integrated culture systems (e.g., rice-cum-fish, fish and pig, fish with ducks or&#13;
poultry), feeding and choice of available agro-industrial by-products, manuring of ponds, grow-out&#13;
period, use of siphons for ponds draining, harvesting and marketing, and record keeping and business&#13;
management. Substantive research results are available from international research institutions, such&#13;
as the International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (Philippines), which can readily&#13;
be adopted to conditions in Ghana. The IAB has also done some research in aquaculture, and has the&#13;
capacity to develop more technological packages with funding under the on-going IDA-supported&#13;
National Agricultural Research Project). The extension program would be closely linked with the&#13;
unified agricultural extension service, and the responsible fisheries officers would serve as subject-&#13;
matter-specialists (SMSs). Because of the high specialty of aquaculture, the SMSs would extend&#13;
direct advice to selected lead farmers until the capacity of the front-line staff of the Department of&#13;
Extension is developed. Support would also be provided to selected Non-Governmental Organizations&#13;
(NGOs) which are already active in the promotion of integrated agriculture-aquaculture development.&#13;
2.16 The project would finance the cost of stock assessment and related fishery investigation on&#13;
principally Lake Volta, and preparation and implementation of management plans in lake fisheries;&#13;
vehicles and equipment; 18 person-months of internationally recruited technical assistance In&#13;
aquaculture and stock assessment; seed money to encourage local NGO-participation in the promotion&#13;
of aquaculture through intensive integrated aquaculture-agriculture production, and extension activities&#13;
associated with aquaculture, including support for a fingerling production and aquaculture&#13;
demonstration center. This component would account for 15 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
Monitoring. Control. and Surveillance (USSI.8 million)&#13;
2.17 The project would create active monitoring, control, and surveillance (MCS) systems in both&#13;
marine and lake fisheries. At-sea MCS function would be contracted out to the Ghanaian Navy for&#13;
about 60 ship-days per year to be applied at random and in unpredictable manner for MCS activities&#13;
along and beyond the 30 meter depth line; the full cost of naval MCS would be financed by the&#13;
Govermnent as part of its counterpart financial contribution to the project. The naval MCS activities&#13;
would be supplemented by land-based activities to be undertaken by the DOF. All MCS functions&#13;
would be managed by DOF's MCS Division through a command and control center to be established&#13;
at headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.18 The project would finance the purchases of small patrol boats to be used in lakes; vehicles and&#13;
equipment for land-based patrols; 8 person-months of technical assistance to help set up the MCS&#13;
system; and incremental operating expenses associated with the MCS activities. This component&#13;
would account for 17 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
E. Project Cost&#13;
2.19 The total project cost is estimated at US$10.5 million. The cost estimate includes a physical&#13;
contingency of 15 percent on civil works. Allowances for expected price increases are computed&#13;
based on projected international price increases of 2.0 percent in 1995, 2.5 percent in 1996, 2.7&#13;
percent in 1997, 2.5 percent in 1998, 2.6 percent in 1999, and 2.7 percent in 2000; base costs are&#13;
computed using prices prevailing in December 1994. The cost estimate is summarized below; the&#13;
schedule of expenditure is in Annex 4.&#13;

F. Financing&#13;
2.20 An IDA credit of US$9 million is proposed, which would finance 85 percent of the total&#13;
project cost. The Republic of Ghana would finance the remaining US$1.5 million of the project cost,&#13;
which would be manageable when spread over a 5-year implementation period; the counterpart&#13;
funding requirements for each year of the project is shown in Annex 5.&#13;
2.21 Establishment by the Borrower in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA of a Project Account&#13;
with an Initial deposit of US$100,000 equivalent in local currency to cover counterpart expenditures&#13;
shall be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit (para. 5.1 (b)). Counterpart funding&#13;
requirements by years and project components are shown in Annex S.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
2.22 Goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or more per contract and rehabilitation of the research&#13;
vessel that would be used for marine stock assessment would be procured following international&#13;
competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines; four contracts worth about US$325,000,&#13;
US$425,000, US$195,000, and US$665,000 would fall in this category. Equipment (such as&#13;
laboratory, oceanographic, office, and telecommunication) estimated to cost about US$325,000 wou.ld&#13;
be procured through the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO) of the UNDP. Goods&#13;
estimated to cost below US$40,000 per contract but not exceeding an aggregate of&#13;
US$325,000 would be procured by local shopping with written quotations from at least three different&#13;
suppliers. Civil works, costing about US$2,610,000 would be tendered in lots of about 35 contracts&#13;
following local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures which would be acceptable to IDA. These&#13;
would not be suitable for ICB since the works would be dispersed over several locations and the&#13;
amounts would be too small to attract foreign bids. Tle LCB procedures would, however, allow bids&#13;
from foreign contractors. Consultants would be recruited in accordance with principles and&#13;
procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency." Training programs would be&#13;
developed and trainees would be selected in consultation with IDA. Miscellaneous items under&#13;
incremental operating expenses would be procured following existing Government practices and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
2.23 Schedules for procurement of equipment under ICB and through IAPSO, and civil works under&#13;
LCB are shown in Annex 6, 7, and 8, respectively. Tne timetable for recruitment of consultants is&#13;
shown in Annex 9. The first year training program is discussed in Annex 2; the programs of training&#13;
for subsequent years would be specified during implementation, in consultation with IDA, when&#13;
project managers would have input in determining the priorities of training, selection of trainees, and&#13;
duratkon of training. Prior review by IDA would be required of all procurement packages,&#13;
recomrnmendations for award, and contracts for works and goods above a threshold of US$100,000.&#13;
The review process would cover about 60 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the total values of&#13;
.he contracts for works and goods; selective post review of awarded contracts below the threshold&#13;
:evels would be carried out on about I out of 4 such contracts. Prior review would be required of&#13;
;ontracts for consultant services above the threshold of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,00 for&#13;
ndiv;duals.&#13;
.24  Delays in prourerne:nt have had a significant adverse impact on performance of the IDA's&#13;
*  irt&lt;;c im The pas:. Improvements have, however, been made in the recent past due mainly to the&#13;
f   ,i e4        pri.eduure- for internal review and approval of procurement for goods and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
works, and for recruitment of consultants. Training of project staff by IDA, adoption of standard&#13;
bidding documents, and simplified procedures for the selection of consultants have contributed to the&#13;
improved performance. The project would benefit from these improvements. The Project&#13;
Coordination Unit of MOFA, which would coordinate procurement on behalf of the DOF, has had&#13;
extensive experience in procurement under previous IDA-assisted projects, and would assign qualified&#13;
staff to manage procurement under this project. Use of IDA's standard bidding document for&#13;
procurement of goods would be mandatory; sample bidding documents for use in procurement under&#13;
LCB (civil works) were prepared and agreed with IDA at negotiations. Finalization of tender&#13;
documents for the procurement of vehicles and equipment under ICB, and of arrangement for the&#13;
rehabilitation of a research vessel, shall be a condition of effectiveness (para. 5.1 (c)). The schedules&#13;
for procurement of goods and works, selection of consultants and training, along with the, standard&#13;
times for various procurement actions up to contract signing were agreed during negotiations and&#13;
reflected in the minutes of negotiations.&#13;

Unallocated              380&#13;
Total            9,000          _&#13;
The disbursements would be completed in 5 1/2 years. The estimates are based on the projected rate&#13;
of construction/rehabilitation of buildings, and on expected timing for delivery of equipment and&#13;
vehicles, provision of consultancy services, rehabilitation of a research vessel, and carrying out of&#13;
stock assessment. The disbursement profile for the agricultural sector in the Africa Region shows&#13;
disbursements extending over about 7 1/2 years, but the shorter disbursement period under the project&#13;
is based on the following: (a) about 50 percent of the proposed IDA credit would be disbursed&#13;
against civil works, vehicles and equipment, and rehabilitation of a research vessel; these would be&#13;
nearly completed not later than the second year of project implementation; (b) about 20 percent of the&#13;
credit would be disbursed against incremental expenses mostly associated with MCS and stock&#13;
assessment, and these would start accruing at the start of project implementation; and (c) most of the&#13;
remaining 30 percent would be disbursed against training for which detailed implementation programs&#13;
would be prepared every year in consultation with IDA; the training component would be monitored&#13;
closely during implementation to ensure compliance with agreed timetables. Operating expenditures&#13;
would include the incremental costs incurred under the project to finance utilities, fuel and other&#13;
vehicle operatirg expenses, per diem while on assignment away from duty stations, cost of temporary&#13;
hired labor, cost of publications, and costs of office and laboratory supplies. Projected schedule of&#13;
disbutsemenz is shown in Annex tO.&#13;
2 2-  n ozder to acilitate disbursements, a special account would be opened at a commercial bank&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, an amount of US$150,000 representing 50 percent of the&#13;
initial deposit will be deposited to the special account. The remaining balance will be made available&#13;
as needed. The special account would be used for all payments below US$30,000. Replenishments&#13;
would be submitted monthly. All replenishment requests will be fully documented except for (a)&#13;
contracts for goods and works of less than US$100,000 equivalent, (b) contracts for services of less&#13;
than US$50,000 equivalent, and (c) operating costs which would be claimed on the basis of statements&#13;
of expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation would be retained for review by visiting&#13;
supervision missions and the external auditors. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the&#13;
Borrower shall establish, in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, a Special Account, in U.S.&#13;
dollars, to cover eligible expenditures under the IDA credit, and maintain this Special Account&#13;
throughout the project's implementation period (para. 5.2 (g)).&#13;
I. Environmental Impact&#13;
2.28 The environmental category is "B". The overall impact of the project would be positive. The&#13;
stock assessment, management plan, improved legal and regulatory frameworks, and the strengthened&#13;
capacity of Government institutions to enforce fishing laws and regulations would all be designed to&#13;
promote sustainability of the fisheries resources. The project would promote environmentally sound&#13;
management of the fisheries resources by communities. Use of explosives and poisons in fishing&#13;
would be prohibited, and severe penalties would be imposed on those who violate the law. The&#13;
extension program would include training on the harmful effects of using explosives and poisons, the&#13;
potential dangers of discarding fishing gear in the waters, the impact on fishing of oil spills and the&#13;
need to avoid spilling lubricants and gasoline while fishing, the importance of timely reporting to the&#13;
appropriate authorities of accidental oil spills, the importance of avoiding the dumping in the ocean of&#13;
human waste in the fishing villages, and other environmentally sensitive matters. Care would be&#13;
taken not to introduce exotic fish and pathogens that could be carriers of communicable diseases, and&#13;
to avoid the proliferation of aquatic weeds.&#13;
M. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization&#13;
3.1 The project would be managed by the DOF, which would assign some activities to the&#13;
appropriate government agencies while maintaining the overall project management authority; cost of&#13;
processing tender documents, including the purchase of a computer and printer, has been included&#13;
under the funding for the strengthening of DOF. The headquarters of the DOF would be in Accra.&#13;
An organigram for project management is shown in Annex 11.&#13;
3.2   The Marine Fisheries Management Division of DOF would be responsible for undertaking the&#13;
stock assessment and preparing the management plans for the marine fisheries; and Inland Fisheries&#13;
Management Division would undertake the census of fishing activities and related studies of the Volta&#13;
Lake, and for implementing the aquaculture pilot program. The Administration and Operations&#13;
Division would be responsible for collating project operational plans and progress reports, managing&#13;
disbursement of the IDA credit, maintaining project accounts and records of expenditures, keeping&#13;
records of fishermen, collecting and managing the various fisheries levies, and arranging audits. The&#13;
new MCS Division would ensure compliance with fisheries regulations established for management&#13;
purposes. It would also help enforce safety-at-sea regulations and assist in search and rescue&#13;
operations. Enforcement would emphasize persuasion, with legal recourse as a last option. MCS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
directed towards the industrial fleet would involve periodic inspections of catch and gear on board,&#13;
and statistics collection through log-book and catch inspections.&#13;
3.3   All procurement would be assigned to an existing Project Coordination Unit of MOFA, which&#13;
has had sufficient experience under previous IDA-funded agricultural projects. All project-related&#13;
training would be prepared and implemented in collaboration with the Manpower and Training&#13;
Department of the MOFA, and the Policy, Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department&#13;
(PPMED) of the ministry would monitor and evaluate the project's implementation performance, and&#13;
would assist the DOF in undertaking special socio-economic studies, if needed. The front-line&#13;
fisheries extension activities would be assigned to the ministry's Department of Extension, with the&#13;
DOF providing the SMSs.&#13;
3.4   The FC would serve as an advisory board (steering committee). The Commission would&#13;
provide broad policy guidelines, ensure the incorporation of the various interest groups in the&#13;
preparation of fisheries management plans, advise on enforcement of fisheries laws and regulations,&#13;
and oversee project progress. The Commission would meet as often as needed to review project&#13;
activities, with the Director of the Fisheries Department acting as the secretary.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.5   The implementation period would be five years, starting in 1996. The first year of the project&#13;
would be devoted to the reorganization of the DOF; training of staff; processing of ICB and LCB&#13;
tender documents for goods and works; procurement of supplies and equipment that would not be&#13;
subject to ICB or LCB procedures; hiring of consultants; initiation of the stock assessment, MCS, and&#13;
aquaculture programs; and preparation of a detailed operational plan for the coming year. The second&#13;
year would be devoted to continuation of the stock assessment, MCS, and aquaculture and training&#13;
programs, completion of rehabilitation of buildings, and completion of the procurement of vehicles&#13;
and equipment. Firm fisheries management systems would be put in place, and all fishing vessels&#13;
would be registered and licensed by the end of the second year. During the last two years, the&#13;
demersal stocks should begin to recover and a special project impact assessment would be made on&#13;
this; the DOF should prove to be a more effective fisheries resources management agency and a&#13;
special impact assessment would be made to confirm this; good feedback should be available to assess&#13;
the potential for further expansion of aquaculture; and the project's overall impact should be evaluated&#13;
and the lessons used to prepare subsequent development programs for the sub-sector.&#13;
C. ProgIress Reporting. M1onitoring, and Evaluation&#13;
3.6   The Department of Fisheries would prepare regularly operational plans for routine work and&#13;
management plans for the fisheries. The operational plan would initially be concerned with the&#13;
reorganization of the Department, assignment of staff, preparation of training programs, redrafting of&#13;
the fisheries legislation, and procurement of goods and services, initiation of stock assessment and&#13;
preparation of management plans, initiation of the pilot aquaculture program, and initiation of the&#13;
NICS activities.&#13;
3.7   The DOF would prepare regular progress reports on the project; the format and content were&#13;
reviewed during negotiations. The PPMIED would mnonitor overall project implementation, and&#13;
,!repare a completi:n report on the program focussing on the program's impact and lessons learned.&#13;
The DOF and PPIMED would use the project's key indicators shown in Annex 13 to monitor the&#13;
project's performance, and the progress reports would include a table showing comparison of targets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
against actual performance for selected key indicators. Detailed implementation arrangements and&#13;
timetables for each project component, as well as terms of reference for consultants, are set out In the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual. The two departments would collaborate In preparing the project's&#13;
completion report, and a possible follow-up project. Adoption by the Borrower of a Project&#13;
Implementation Plan acceptable to IDA shall be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA&#13;
credit (para. 5.1 (d)). Assurances were obtained that the Borrower shall: (a) submit to IDA at the end&#13;
of each semester of the calendar year a progress report on the implementation of the project in a&#13;
format acceptable to IDA, (b) organize and carry out, not later than October 31 of each calendar year&#13;
a joint review meeting for the Borrower and IDA. At each annual review meeting, the Borrower&#13;
shall present an action program for the implementation of the project during the coming fiscal year to&#13;
IDA for appraisal, and (c) thereafter implement such action program for the fiscal year in question&#13;
(para. 5.2 (h)).&#13;
D. Prolect Supervision&#13;
3.8  IDA would continue to help the Department of Fisheries during subsequent phases of the&#13;
project cycle. The initial phase of implementation is expected to be the most difficult, and IDA's&#13;
implementation assistance would be the most intense at that stage. IDA would mount the first official&#13;
supervision mission after the credit becomes effective, to launch the project's implementation.&#13;
Subsequent missions would take place every six months with the interval decreasing gradually. The&#13;
supervision plan is in Annex 12.&#13;
3.9   At the beginning of the third year, there would be a Mid-Term Review (MTR) to take stock&#13;
of: implementation performance and assess bottlenecks; review the impact of the fisheries&#13;
management plans that would have been in effect for about one year by then; effect of naval patrols&#13;
on preventing intrusive fishing by unauthorized foreign vessels; performance of the DOF in the&#13;
collection and use of fisheries statistics, and its effectiveness in coastal and land-based patrols; effects&#13;
of improved management plans on the regeneration of particularly the marine demersal stocks;&#13;
effectiveness of the pilot aquaculture program and its potential for further expansion; impact of the&#13;
institutional strengthening program in improving effectiveness of the DOF; usefulness of the steering&#13;
committee in project implementation, and its role in subsequent phases; and effectiveness of&#13;
participatory extension (use of traditional leadership in fishing villages) in improving the management&#13;
of the fisheries resources. The DOF's progress reports and IDA's supervision reports would be used&#13;
in the MTR. Assurances were obtained that the Borrower shall: (a) not later than December 31,&#13;
1997, carry out jointly with IDA, a mid-term review of the project covering, inter aYia, the above&#13;
topics, (b) in order to facilitate the MTR, prepare and submit to IDA, not later than sixty days before&#13;
the scheduled date of the MTR, a report on project activities in such scope and in such detail as IDA&#13;
shall have reasonably requested, and (c) not later than two weeks after the mid-term review, prepare&#13;
an action program, acceptable to IDA, to deal with deficiencies in project and program&#13;
implementation identified during the review and shall thereafter implement such action program (para.&#13;
5.2 (i)).&#13;
E. Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
3.10 Since this Is a capacity-building project, technical assistance and training would be important,&#13;
with the former accounting for about 5 percent and the latter 15 percent of the total cost of the&#13;
project. At the request of the DOF, 38 person-months of internationally recruited consultants have&#13;
been included. These include specialists In fisheries management, MCS, stock assessment in lake&#13;
fisheries, and aquaculture; only short-term international consultants would be used to the extent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
feasible; there are no qualified professionals locally who can undertake these activities. The&#13;
consultants will at all times be working with local counterparts who will receive on-the-job training in&#13;
the process. In addition, 65 person-months of accountants to be recruited locally on contract-basis&#13;
have been included because there are severe shortages of accountants in the country, the competition&#13;
from the private sector for the few available professional accountants is stiff, and it would not be&#13;
possible to recruit staff on standard public services compensation package. The terms of reference of&#13;
the consultants would include training of counterpart staff.&#13;
3.11 Most of the training is expected to be undertaken locally and in other developing countries.&#13;
That way, large numbers of staff would be trained for extended periods at lower unit costs. In the&#13;
exceptional case of external training, preference would be given to training in developing economies&#13;
with similar circumstances to Ghana, international agencies that specialize in fisheries resource&#13;
management, and study tours in countries with relevant experiences.&#13;
F. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.12 The Administration Division of the DOF would maintain a separate project account. The&#13;
project account would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; the audits would include&#13;
all statements of expenditures. Assurances were obtained that the Borrower shall submit audited&#13;
project accounts, Special and Project Accounts, fisheries levies to be collected by the DOF, and&#13;
statements of expenditures, audited and certified by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, annually&#13;
within six months after the close of the Government's fiscal year (para. 5.2 (j)).&#13;
3.13 With the concurrence of the Ministry of Finance, the DOF would have the overall management&#13;
responsibility for collecting fisheries levies on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service. The vessel&#13;
registration process is an important step in the setting up of a reliable data base for assessment of the&#13;
levies. The DOF would fully involve the fishers and their associations in the identification,&#13;
registration, licensing, and collection of levies. Some retention scheme may be devised whereby a&#13;
portion of the revenue is used to improve services to fishers, thus increasing the acceptance and&#13;
ownership of the project by the beneficiaries, including the taxation elements. *Role of associations in&#13;
promoting acceptance of levies on individual members and their effective collection have been&#13;
successfully demonstrated, such as in the case of transport where the Ghana Private Road Transport&#13;
Users Association, a federated body of several transport unions with thousands of members, collects&#13;
transported-related tax on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service and monitors compliance.&#13;
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS. AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1   Economic Benefits. The main benefit of the project would be a major improvement in the&#13;
management of the fisheries resources, which would lead to recovery of the fish stock. This, in turn,&#13;
would allow for a sustainable increase of between 15,000 and 33,000 tons per year in the production&#13;
of fish from the marine and inland fisheries (the lower figure, which is used for computing the Net&#13;
Present Value or NPV and Economic Rate of Return or ERR, is an estimate based on a recovery of&#13;
only the demersal fishery, and the higher figure includes estimates of recovery for all fisheries); the&#13;
long term bi6logical conservation, protection and sustainability of the resource (alternatively expressed&#13;
as the prevention of declines or collapses in fisheries production that would occur in the absence of an&#13;
appropriate and effective fisheries management regime); the improvement of the economic efficiency,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
performance and profitability of the participants in the fishery; improvement of the institutional and&#13;
policy frameworks for sustainable development of the sub-sector; and increased contribution of the&#13;
sub-sector to public revenues.&#13;
4.2   The NPV, based on only the recovery of the demersal fishery and using a discount rate of 12&#13;
percent, is estimated at US$28.1 million. The NPV would be US$80.0 million if the benefits include&#13;
the recovery from all fisheries. The ERR, based on only the recovery of the demersal stock, is&#13;
computed at 44.8 percent. Details are in Annex 14.&#13;
4.3   Fiscal Benefits. To-date, the contribution of the fisheries sub-sector to fiscal revenue has been&#13;
marginal. The project would transfer some of the incremental private financial benefits to the public&#13;
sector through registration and licensing of vessels, increased levies, and improved collection effort.&#13;
The collections from the domestic catches are projected to increase from the current level of about&#13;
US$20,000 per year in the form of license fees to US$0.5 million in 1998 to a level of USS 0.8&#13;
million in the year 2000, mainly in the form of royalty payments. The net present value of the&#13;
incremental fiscal benefits, discounted @12 percent over the assumed life of the project amount to&#13;
US$1.2 million for the most conservative scenario (i.e. recovery of only the demersal fishery and no&#13;
increase in the levy beyond one percent of the gross landed value of catch).&#13;
B. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.4   The main risks are financial (shortage of counterpart funds, a general public finance problem&#13;
that affects all the agricultural portfolio), institutional (the DOF is weak relative to the task at hand&#13;
and although the project directly addresses this issue, changes in management and administrative&#13;
processes and culture may not occur at the pace assumed), and biological (the actual recovery of the&#13;
fishery resources could be adversely affected by unforeseen environmental factors, such as&#13;
upwellirig).&#13;
4.5   On project finance, Govermnent has indicated that the shortage of counterpart funds is a short-&#13;
termn problem, that it in no way implies the sector's low priority in the public investment program,&#13;
that it does not expect the problem to continue, and that it intends to allocate the necessary&#13;
counterpart resources in the coming budgets. In any event, the project would also generate additionai&#13;
public revenue, depending on the level and timing of the recovery of the fisheries, some of which&#13;
could be used to finance the public expenditures in the sub-sector. Rectification of the institutional&#13;
capacity weaknesses is a major component of the project and many of the actions needed to strengthen&#13;
capacity of the DOF will be implemented up-front. Most of the training and technical assistance and&#13;
other institution building activities are also front-loaded. During implementation, IDA and the&#13;
Borrower would conduct detailed annual reviews of implementation, where the focus would be&#13;
advance identification of problems and solutions, including institutional capacity and counterpart&#13;
funding. The biological risks would be minimized through the environmental quality-enhancement&#13;
aspects of the project's design. The protection of spawning grounds from fishing, enforcement of&#13;
mesh and gear standards and banning the use of traps and explosives in fishing, are designed to&#13;
protect juveniles, and to enhance recruitment in the various fisheries and recovery of the fish biomass.&#13;
4.6  If the biological, financial and institutional risks materialized to adversely affect the project, in-&#13;
spite of the mitigating features In the project design discussed above, they would delay and weaken&#13;
the strength of the recovery of the fish stocks in the various fisheries. The sensitivity analysis is&#13;
based on the probable impact of the risks to the project in their order of significance and their&#13;
likelihood to materialize. To assess the sensitivity of the project results to the biological, financial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and institutional risks, the following changes were made: volume estimates were reduced by 25&#13;
percent, and the benefits were assumed not to commence until year six.&#13;
4.7   A weaker than expected recovery, reflected in a 25 percent reduction in fish biomass at full&#13;
recovery, would reduce the NPV of the project for the base case to $18.6 million and the ERR to&#13;
36.9 percent. Deferring the commencement of benefits from year four to year six would reduce the&#13;
NPV to $17.2 million and the ERR to 29.8 percent.&#13;
4.8   The sensitivity of the net benefit stream to a possible softening of markets and prices was&#13;
assessed by reducing prices 20 percent. This reduces the NPV to $20.5 million and the ERR to 38.6&#13;
percent for the base case (dermesal fishery). A combined reduction in volumes, delay in&#13;
commencement of benefits and reduction in real prices by 20 percent would yield NPV of $10.3&#13;
million and ERR of 25.3 percent.&#13;
C. Sustainabilit,&#13;
4.9   The project is sustainable. It would strengthen the institutional, policy, legal, and regulatory&#13;
frameworks in order to establish the long-term sustainability of the fisheries resource and thereby&#13;
maximize the sub-sector's contribution to the economy. Fisheries management plans would be&#13;
prepared and implemented, there would be provisions in the revised fisheries law and regulations to&#13;
enforce compliance with the management plans, communities would be encouraged to participate in&#13;
the management of the resources through their traditional leadership and associations of fishers, and a&#13;
strong monitoring, control, and surveillance system would be put in place to enforce compliance with&#13;
the law.&#13;
4.10 The project would be the first comprehensive public investment in the sub-sector, although the&#13;
investment is quite modest when compared with investments in recent projects in other sub-sectors.&#13;
Nevertheless, it would increase the public expenditures in the sub-sector by US$0.7 million per year,&#13;
which would be sufficient to sustain it. The institutional and policy reforms would form the&#13;
foundation for private investment in the sub-sector for many years to come.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
Training Needs Analysis&#13;
Current Professional Staff Profile of DOF and ExDected Tasks&#13;
1.    DOF now has a total staff complement of 478, of whom 70 percent are broadly classified as&#13;
"professional", and the remaining 30 percent are secretaries, clerks, and laborers.&#13;
2.    The "professional" staff are generally categorized into three groups, based on qualification St&#13;
entry:&#13;
(a)    Professional Staff. The professional staff enter the DOF with a minimum&#13;
qualification of B.Sc degree from any of the sciences with preference for the natural&#13;
sciences. Their skills are acquired primarily "on the job' and through Ad Iz short-&#13;
term external training opportunities offered by donor. This category of staff constitute&#13;
the core officer cadre, and are designated Assistant Fisheries Officer upon entry into&#13;
service. They now account for nine percent of the total strength of DOF.&#13;
(b)    Sub-Professional Staff. These are Fisheries Diploma certificate holders who are&#13;
designated Production Officers at the point of entry. Production officers can only&#13;
progress to a maximum position of Chief Production Officer. These account for one&#13;
percent of the staff complement.&#13;
(c)    Technical Ofcers. At the lower level of the professional staff are the General&#13;
Certificate of Education (Ordinary Level) and Middle School Certificate holders who&#13;
are initially appointed as Technical Officer Grade 1. Their main assignment is to&#13;
assist higher level staff in the collection of fisheries statistics. The staff account for&#13;
about 60 percent of the staff complement.&#13;
xpecttj Job Descriptions of the Professional Staff&#13;
3.    The expected tasks of the professional staff are summarized below:&#13;
:a)    Protessional and Sub-Professional. These are expected to be in charge of planning,&#13;
mari -.esnent, training, supervision, policy formulation and monitoring of all activities&#13;
in the frsheries sLb-sector. Specifically, they would:&#13;
(i   -ovi fde professional leadership for the sustainable development of marine and&#13;
*r3an&amp; fisheries by, ir!te r AX, preparing and managing the implementation of&#13;
-rl i;n,ment systems for marine and inland fisheries,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
ANNEX 2Z&#13;
Page 2 of S&#13;
(ii)  undertake stock and catch assessment, and supervise the collection of other data&#13;
to be used for,  jjjj, for management decision making,&#13;
(iii) prepare development strategies and policies relating to the sub-sector, and liaise&#13;
with other public and private agencies on all matters affecting fisheries,&#13;
(iv) act as SMSs in fisheries, and where deemed appropriate extend to users modern&#13;
methods of fishing, preservation, and marketing of fish,&#13;
(v)  undertake oceanographic and biological studies, including environmental studies&#13;
as they relate to fish production in marine and inland waters, and&#13;
(vi) interpret and enforce the provisions of the fisheries laws and regulations.&#13;
(b)    Technical Officers. The bulk of these would be deployed along the coast and the&#13;
Volta Lake to implement development programs. They would mobilize the fishers&#13;
into groups and ensure group participation in the formulation of the management plans&#13;
in the implementation of those plans. They would educate the fishing communities on&#13;
the need for conservation, and promote community management of the fisheries&#13;
resources.&#13;
Training Needs&#13;
4.    The staff of DOF do not now have the right orientation to perform their increasingly&#13;
complicated and difficult tasks. In particular:&#13;
(a)    The pre-service training is more geared towards fisheries science than resource&#13;
management. None of the professional officers has formal training in fisheries&#13;
management, economics, fisheries technology, fisheries policy, and on the practical&#13;
aspects of fish production and marketing before entering the service. The pre-service&#13;
training is often technical and theoretical, and aims primarily at producing scientists&#13;
rather than resource management specialists. The linkage between training institutions&#13;
and DOF so far as curriculum development is weak.&#13;
(b)    There is a disproportionally higher number of technical staff who do not have adequato&#13;
professional training, compared to the professional staff,&#13;
(c)    DOF lacks a coherent staff development program. It does not spell out job description&#13;
for its officers upon engagement, and the officers acquire their skills througb practical&#13;
on-the-job experience. Great effort needs to be made&#13;
to re-orient their activities, build sense of professional respect for the officors by tbe&#13;
beneficiaries, and mutual trust between the professionals and t  fishen.&#13;
'4d    DOF has not been able to institutionalize in-service training programs to keep up with&#13;
m  technoloSies in management of fisherios resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(e)    DOF lacks the capacity in key areas related to environmental aspects as well as&#13;
fisheries economics in order to prepare and implement a holistic fisheries management&#13;
plan.&#13;
Training Institutions&#13;
5.    Pre-service training of the professional and sub-professional staff is provided at three local&#13;
universities: University of Ghana at Lagon, University of Cape Coast, and University of Science at&#13;
Kumasi. In addition, a Regional Maritime Academy provides special training in boat safety,&#13;
engineering, and navigation.&#13;
6.    The primary objectives of the faculties of sciences are to provide academic training in the&#13;
sciences (physics, mathematics, chemistry, zoology, botany and biological sciences). The current&#13;
crop of fisheries officers are the products of the departments of Zoology, Fisheries and&#13;
Oceanography, and Biological Sciences.&#13;
7.    The curriculum in all the universities are fairly similar, and they focus on marine and fresh&#13;
water biology at both graduate and post graduate levels. However, the University of Science and&#13;
Technology (through its Institute of Renewable Natural Resources) has a much broader syllabus&#13;
covering such areas as watershed management, business management and administration for natural&#13;
resource managers, fisheries management, and fisheries economics.&#13;
8.    The universities do not have adequately trained staff to teach courses that are relevant for the&#13;
management of fisheries resources. The science teachers would need to be complemented with&#13;
faculty that specialize in the economics and management of fisheries resources. The current science&#13;
teaching staff include the following:&#13;
Number by Degrees  _&#13;
University    Pb.D      M.Sc.      B. SC.     Total&#13;
Leg-on            1        3          --4&#13;
Cape Coast      4                                4&#13;
Kumasi                     2          1          3&#13;
The teaching staff of the Regional Maritime Academy include 3 professional navigators and 1&#13;
engineer.&#13;
9.    The universities and Regional Maritime Academy are not adequately financed to maintain and&#13;
gradually expand their facilities in support of their educational activities. The facilities lack books,&#13;
teaching aids, laboratory equipment, etc. A major investment would have to be undertaken to&#13;
improve the facilities in order to build the local capacity for training.&#13;

Proposed Training Program&#13;
10.   The first priority over the short-run (the first year) would focus on reorientation training ou&#13;
new approaches in the management of the fisheries resources, and crash courses in technical areas that&#13;
would be relevant for activities to be undertaken under the project. That would be supplemented with&#13;
study tours by managers to international fisheries research institutions and countries that have&#13;
successful fisheries development program. The orientation training would focus on the rationale of&#13;
the project, the role and responsibilities of the re-organized DOF, and on the revised fisheries law and&#13;

technical staff would need to be upgraded, preferably at one of the local training institutions. That&#13;
way, the capacity of the local training institutions would be simultaneously improved, and more&#13;
trainees would be trained at a lower cost than sending them aborad. This may&#13;
require upgrading the training institutions by providing essential equipment, improving facilities, and&#13;
building the foundation for sustaining the training program focusing on training of the trainers in&#13;
Fisheries Economics, Fish Feeds and Feeding, Environmental Science, and&#13;
Chemical and Physical Oceanography, Limnology, and Fisheries Management. The long-term&#13;
capacity building institutions would need to be developed in consultation with the Ministries of&#13;
Education and Food and Agriculture, and in a manner that would be consistent with the tertiary&#13;
education development strategy of the country. Support will be provided only if the institutions&#13;
would be willing to revise their curricula to reflect the needs of sub-sector and fishing industry.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
Fisheries Management Plan and MCS&#13;
A. Fisheries Management Plan&#13;
Inroduction&#13;
1.   In this section, the current fisheries management problems are reviewed and recommendations&#13;
are made concerning appropriate short term and long term planning measures. The fisheries&#13;
management plans will essentially be the blueprint for the effective management of the fisheries&#13;
resources, to be implemented through the provisions of the Fisheries Law, extension activities, and an&#13;
effective Monitoring, Control and Surveillance System backed up by a Judicial system to deal with&#13;
breaches of the Law. The planning process must address the biological Issues as well as the issues of&#13;
over-fishing, over-capitalization, the impact of technological change, the effect of effort diversion,&#13;
and the overall economic and social impacts and consequences of introducing management measures&#13;
into a fishery.&#13;
2.   The essential element is to establish a planning framework, develop consistent objectives,&#13;
introduce only those measures necessary to the achievement of the objectives, monitor and evaluate&#13;
the effectiveness of the measures and adjust them over time to ensure that the objectivs are met.&#13;
The Management Problem&#13;
3.   The current approach to fisheries management in Ghana is embodied in the existing provisions&#13;
of the Fisheries Law 1991. While certain prescriptions and provisions are codified in the Law, they&#13;
do not provide a system to manage the fishery resources for either their long term sustainability or to&#13;
promote the economic efficiency of the harvesting, processing or marketing. The Law provides for&#13;
the banning of certain types of fishing in certain areas, the setting of minimum mesh sizes, the use of&#13;
closed or limited seasons in specific areas, controlling the types of nets that may be imported or&#13;
manufactured, controlling the use of "unauthorized contrivances' for fishing, protection of juvenile&#13;
and gravid crustaceans, and licensing of fishing vessels. These provisions form the basis of the&#13;
management" of Ghana's fisheries resources; and when coupled with the MCS and penalty&#13;
provisions of the Law, make up the fisheries management regime.&#13;
4.   The degree of exploitation of Ghana's fisheries varies from species to species and fishery to&#13;
fishery. The artisanal fishery, which is based around the anchovy and sardinella fishery is fully&#13;
exploited with a large number of canoes operating to catch the resource available. The nature of this&#13;
resource is such that it is susceptible to fluctuations more in response to environmental factors than to&#13;
fishing effort. However, such biological protection from over-fishing cannot be relied upon solely. It&#13;
is possible to over-fish these resources, especially if fishing effort continually expands through new&#13;
participants entering or through the introduction of new technologies, and through the use of fishing&#13;
methods and practices that increase the catches of juveniles. The issues to be addressed relate to die&#13;
number of fishers in this fishery and the fishing techniques and practices usod. AU she canos I is&#13;
fishery should be registered and licensed. This will improve the infbrmation base ad lay the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
foundation for some future revenue contribution from this fishery. It is recommended that&#13;
management measures be implemented to control the types of gear (net and mesh size particularly), to&#13;
control the beach seine fishery and to limit the numbers of canoes in the future. The latter measure&#13;
will need to be finally determined after a clearer picture of the current situation is established. In the&#13;
longer term, some form of more direct 'community involvement" in the management of this sector is&#13;
recommended.&#13;
5.    The inshore fishery operates with small in-board powered vessels catching demersal species&#13;
relatively close to shore on the continental shelf. Much of the current problem in this fishery has&#13;
arisen as a result of the incursion of very large deep-water trawlers that began fishing in Ghana&#13;
following their exclusion from other EEZs. This has produced conflict between the two parts of the&#13;
sector, and has dramatically increased the pressure on the demersal resources. There is also some&#13;
evidence of damage to the fishing grounds from the larger heavier gear used by these vessels. It is&#13;
recommended that in the first instance the larger vessels should be restricted to fishing outside the 30&#13;
meter depth line, that their catches be carefully monitored to ensure that they do not place excessive&#13;
pressure on either the demersal stocks in this area or the other species they are likely to diversify&#13;
into, (until the monitoring system is fully functional there should be a moratorium on any new&#13;
licenses or permits), and that consideration be given in this monitoring to the possibility that in the&#13;
longer term some form of property rights management might be an appropriate approach.&#13;
6.    The tuna fishery is capable of significant expansion and this should be allowed to take place in&#13;
response to market signals. An inhibiting factor in the expansion of this fishery is the restriction in&#13;
the Law concerning the minimum age of vessels. This restriction should be removed, and the&#13;
decision on the type and age of vessel to be used should be left to the private sector. It is&#13;
recommended that the management system incorporate an effective catch monitoring and recording&#13;
system to allow the fishery to be monitored and evaluated to ensure that the resource does not become&#13;
over-fished or over-capitalised and that some form of property rights management be considered in&#13;
the future.&#13;
7.    The inland fishery is in many respects the parallel of the artisanal marine fishery.&#13;
Accordingly, the solutions are also similar. Management measures are required that; ban the use of&#13;
small mesh nets, ban nets that damage the resource, and allow the management authority to outlaw&#13;
fishing techniques and practices that damage the inland fishery environment or threaten recruitment&#13;
into the fishery by increasing the catches of spawning and juvenile fish. There may also be a need&#13;
for some limitation to be placed on the total number of fishers in this fishery at some future time. In&#13;
the longer term a significant degree of 'self-management" by the fishing communities of the inland&#13;
fishery resources should be promoted.&#13;
The Management Function&#13;
8.    The management function will focus on the two principal fisheries: the marine fishery and the&#13;
Inland fishery. It will be important, however, to carefully consider the inter-relationships between the&#13;
two parts of the sector when management plans are being prepared. The two fisheries are not&#13;
mutually exclusive. There is significant interchange between them, with fishers moving relativdy&#13;
freely between the Inland water system and the Marine enviromnent and vice versa. This presents&#13;
particular problems in relation to control mechanisms that may be designed specifically to limit or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
reduce effort in one or both of these fisheries. It also raises questions concerning the types of gear,&#13;
fishing practices and fishing technologies used in each fishery and the consequences of possibly&#13;
inconsistent or even contradictory management measures.&#13;
9.    The proposed revised and redrafted Fisheries Law (which will incorporate in some way the&#13;
effective provisions of the current Law) will provide the legal structure and framework for the&#13;
fisheries management plans and for the fisheries management planning process. The "draft" Law&#13;
proposes that a fisheries management plan be prepared for each fishery (defined either as a single or a&#13;
multi-species, multi-method fishery) and that each plan shall: (a) identify the fishery resource and its&#13;
characteristics, including its economic and social value and interrelationship with other species in the&#13;
eco-system, (b) assess the present state of exploitation of the fishery resource and potential average&#13;
annual yields, (c) specify the objectives to be achieved in the management and development of the&#13;
fishery, (d) taking into account the best information on all relevant biological, social, economic and&#13;
other applicable factors, determine the maximum sustainable yields, (e) (i) taking into account&#13;
information described in the preceding subparagraphs, determine a total allowable catch for each&#13;
fishery or such other conservation and management measures as may be appropriate, (ii) where there&#13;
is insufficient information and advice, identify a plan for determining such information and take&#13;
appropriate conservation and management measures, (f) specify the measures, if any, to be taken to&#13;
promote the development of local fisheries, (g) determine the amount of the fishery resource, if any,&#13;
to be made available to licensed foreign fishing vessels;&#13;
(h) specify the conservation and management measures to be enforced to protect the fishery resource&#13;
from over-exploitation, (i) specify the research necessary to enhance management of the fishery, (j)&#13;
specify the information and other data required to be given or reported for effective management and&#13;
development, and (k) take into account any relevant traditional fishing methods or principles. The&#13;
Law will also include provisions for appropriate consultation and for prescribing regulations to&#13;
implement the plan.&#13;
Consultation&#13;
10.   While the ultimate responsibility for the establishment of those parameters that protect the&#13;
sustainability of the resource, and for the prescription of the management plans correctly remains with&#13;
the Minister of MOFA and the DOF, the plans must be prepared with the fullest participation of the&#13;
fishers and the relevant parts of each sector of the industry. The consultation with, and involvement&#13;
of, the fishing industry is an essential prerequisite for the successful introduction of any fisheries&#13;
management plan. The importance of "ownership" of the Plan cannot be overemphasized. While&#13;
consensus may not always be possible the process of consultation is critical. Without involvement the&#13;
participants will not accept "ownership" and responsibility for the plan and the overall FMR. This in&#13;
turn will significantly impede its development and implementation; but more importantly it will&#13;
reduce the level of compliance with its provisions.&#13;
Next Steps&#13;
11.   The first step to introducing a degree of effective management through the development of&#13;
fisheries management plans is to take some immediate actions to contr3l fishing effort and fishing&#13;
activities and to improve the information available to the managers. The second element is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
establishment of a formalized planning process and the preparation of regularly reviewed and revised&#13;
plans to be followed over the period of the project and beyond. These two steps must be taken&#13;
concurrently.&#13;
12.  In the first instance, the key provisions of the existing Law (either within that Law or within&#13;
the revised Law) be enforced as an interim measure. This will allow for some effective control on&#13;
fishing activities and fishing effort while comprehensive, coherent and consistent fisheries&#13;
management plans are prepared. The following should be used as a guide to the preparation of&#13;
interim plans for the management of the marine and inland fisheries: (a) adopt as a policy objective&#13;
the principal of managing fisheries for the maximization of the economic benefit but within the&#13;
constraint of their long term sustainability, (b) establish 'provisional" Total Allowable Catches (TAC)&#13;
for the major commercial fisheries, (c) implement and enforce the provisions of the Fisheries Law&#13;
that relate to: (i) the exclusion of the large trawlers from inside the 30 meter depth contour,(ii)&#13;
minimum mesh sizes for nets, (iii)restrictions related to net types, (iv) protection for juvenile,&#13;
spawning or gravid fish, (v) banning undesirable fishing practices and techniques ("unauthorized&#13;
contrivance" provision of the Law), (v) registering and licensing of all fishing vessels, (d) establish&#13;
appropriate formal consultation mechanisms to involve the sector participants in the planning process,&#13;
(e) prepare a program of education/extension to inform the fishing sector of the objectives of the&#13;
proposed plan, (f) establish monitoring, and review procedures that will enable the effects of the&#13;
management measures to be evaluated, (g) establish simple procedures for the variation of existing or&#13;
introduction of new management measures, (h) develop and implement the MCS program required to&#13;
support the interim plan, (i) develop proposals to consider the economic and social implications of&#13;
policy and management changes, and 0) ensure that the scientific stock assessment program supports&#13;
the planning process.&#13;
13.   The above approach will have the added benefits of allowing the managers to assess the&#13;
effectiveness of the range of management measures that have already been codified in the existing&#13;
Law (these provisions can be converted to Regulations under the proposed revised Law), and of&#13;
allowing the improvement of the information systems and data bases related to the scientific,&#13;
economic and social aspects of the fishing sector. In the longer term, however, some more clearly&#13;
defined goals and objectives must be developed to provide the policy framework within which the&#13;
long term management of the fisheries can proceed. These should relate to the economic and social&#13;
objectives of managing fisheries, while always ensuring consistency with the biological sustainability&#13;
of the resource.&#13;
14.  The ultimate aim of the planning process and the longer term objective of the FMPs should be&#13;
the introduction of some form of self-management of the appropriate resources within specific&#13;
management guidelines, established by the Government, that ensure the sustainability of the resource.&#13;
For the artisanal (inland and marine) and inshore fisheries, such "community management" should&#13;
involve collective responsibility at the fishing village level, while for the more off-shore demersal,&#13;
and other fisheries such as tuna, some form of property rights regime should be developed. A&#13;
property rights approach would involve the creation of a system of individual tradeable quotas in the&#13;
fishery. The TAC would be divided among the fishers as shares of the TAC based on some agreed&#13;
criteria such as historical catch performance, investment, some measure of commitment to the fishery,&#13;
or by auction or some other form of sale. These quotas or catch entitlements would then be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 5 of 9&#13;
essentially the private property of the fisher who would be able to catch the amount of the quota or&#13;
trade or lease it to another. The quota would be, however, the maximum that could be taken. This&#13;
system provides the most effective management of the resource through directly controlling the output&#13;
rather than the inputs or effort used to take fish. It also ensures the maximization of the economic&#13;
benefits to be derived from a fishery through the elimination of over-capitalization and the&#13;
introduction of efficiency as an objective in the management function.&#13;
15. The time-frame for developing long term fisheries management plans must be compressed as&#13;
much as possible. To be effective the process must be an incremental/adaptive one with the review&#13;
and revision process as the key means of building sound fisheries management plans.&#13;
B. Monitoring. Control. and Surveillance (MCS)&#13;
Status of MCS&#13;
16.  Through ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNLOSC),&#13;
Ghana has established a Territorial Sea extending 12 nautical miles to seaward of her 535 km length&#13;
of coastline, and declared an EEZ extending a further 188 nautical miles. Thus, Ghana may now&#13;
exercise fisheries jurisdiction over a sea area of some 68,000 square nautical miles. The monitoring,&#13;
control, surveillance and enforcement task in the marine fisheries alone is considerable even though&#13;
less than 10 percent of the total EEZ sea area is likely to be fished at any one time.&#13;
17. There is no effective management of Ghana's fishery resources, apart from the limited control&#13;
on new vessels entering the fishery and the technical conservation measures prescribed in the&#13;
Fisheries Law of 1991 and the Fisheries Regulations of 1979. There has been little attempt to achieve&#13;
even a measure of compliance with the minimal restraints in force, either by the fishing industry&#13;
itself, whose interests the regulations are ultimately designed to protect, or by the MOFA.&#13;
18. The demersal stock appears to be in decline, as evidenced by reports of falling catch rates and&#13;
the presence of significant proportions of juvenile fish in catches. Uncontrolled fishing by the large&#13;
distant water freezer factory trawlers in the shallow waters of the continental shelf is contributing&#13;
significantly to the over-exploitation of the demersal stocks remaining in this area. The Fisheries Law&#13;
prohibits trawlers over 50 gross tons to fish in depths of less than 30 meters, but the large sten&#13;
freezer factory vessels continue to fish both pelagic and demersal stocks throughout the narrow&#13;
continental shelf without apparent restraint. Many of the vessels in this fleet are using towed gear in&#13;
waters of less than 30 meters depth using illegal nets extensively. Improved prospects in the offshore&#13;
tuna fishery may encourage the owners of these vessels to invest in new opportunities and reduce their&#13;
presumed economic necessity to fish the coastal waters. Their trawlers are typically past their prime&#13;
and book values, and hence could be gradually taken out of fishing service without appreciable capital&#13;
losses. Also, efforts now underway to gain access to fishing grounds beyond the EEZ may provide&#13;
opportunities for some of these trawlers. Others could be converted to tuna fishing and/or used for&#13;
patrols; a small number might be employed as "klondykers" anchored on the coastal grounds where&#13;
they could use their processing and freezing plants to handle catches transferred to them by the&#13;
inshore boats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
19.   The fishing effort directed at the inshore pelagic stocks by the canoe fleet and inshore purse&#13;
seiners has stabilized. However, further entry into this sector should be controlled to avoid problems&#13;
in future. Legal provision for doing so through licensing and registration of the number of canoes&#13;
already exists in the Fishery Law of 1991, but control of licensing and registration has not been&#13;
implemented by the district authorities to whom this task was delegated; canoe registration may also&#13;
reduce the difficulties of estimating the level of effort in those areas where there is a tendency for&#13;
canoes to move far from their home base and switch gears to meet changing fishing conditions. The&#13;
Fisheries Law also prescribes a minimum mesh size of 25 mm for nets used in this fishery, although&#13;
there is a general lack of compliance with this regulation which is tolerated by the authorities. The&#13;
inshore fleet often violate the prescribed minimum mesh size regulation, and catch the juvenile&#13;
demersal stock. Many of the cod ends of the nets have meshes of legal size but the effective size of&#13;
these meshes had been seriously reduced below the permitted minimum by the attachment of lifting&#13;
bags, top-side chafers, cod-end liners and similar devises. Intensive education would help to promote&#13;
self-regulation in the long-term interest of the fishermen themselves.&#13;
Reinforcing the MCS System&#13;
20.   The Le2al Basis. The legal basis as well as the administrative set up for proper MCS are not&#13;
adequate. Part V of the Fisheries Law of 1991 deals with the legal powers necessary&#13;
to undertake fisheries law enforcement. However, a laissez fair attitude prevails among the numerous&#13;
fishers, all bent on maximizing their catches without regard for conservation or sustainability of the&#13;
resources. A clear foundation for the management of the fisheries resources should be established on&#13;
a priority basis. This should include revision of the law empowering the DOF to undertake the MCS&#13;
function, and establishing the MCS Division within the DOF and assigning adequate staff to it.&#13;
21.   Marine Fishery MCS Functions. The MCS Division should be responsible for the direction&#13;
and effective conduct of all maritime and land-based marine fisheries MCS operations. Its duties&#13;
should be extensive, and should include the enforcement of fisheries legislation, the gathering of&#13;
fisheries intelligence, and the maintenance of a centralized statistical base covering the full extent of&#13;
industrial and inshore fishing operations. The revised fisheries legislation should grant the MCS&#13;
Division the mandate to demand the type, quality, and timing of data submission, and the power to&#13;
apply strict sanctions on companies that do not comply with the legal requirements. The Division&#13;
should have the capability to check the quality of data submitted by the companies by comparing that&#13;
with surveillance information, inspections of catch at sea, detailed spot checks on the weights landed&#13;
at the quay-side, analysis of log books, and inspection of fishers' and buyers' books.&#13;
22.  In offshore areas, the primary MCS function would be deterring, and where necessary,&#13;
apprehending foreign vessels found to be fishing illegally. Other important fisheries inspection duties&#13;
would include monitoring operations of licensed domestic and foreign vessels and ensuring&#13;
compliance with licensing conditions, particularly those requiring Skippers to maintain fishing&#13;
records, fishing effort, and details of the grounds they have fished. Inspectors may also expect to&#13;
monitor and control any transhipping operations undertaken by the vessels. All vessels engaged in&#13;
MCS patrol duties should at all times be ready to render emergency assistance to vessels in distress or&#13;
requiring assistance, including the provision of medical evacuation, technical support, and search and&#13;
rescue operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
ANNEX 3&#13;
Page 7 of 9&#13;
23.  It would not be necessary to provide continuous, year-round patrols in offshore waters,&#13;
provided arrangements are made for a patrol vessel to react quickly to surveillance reports (e.g. from&#13;
licensed fishing vessels operating at sea). Normally, fishing vessels should be inspected at least twice&#13;
a year, and be boarded in rotation and not at short intervals so that fishermen do not feel harassed.&#13;
The patrol vessel should report details of inspections and current activities to the command and&#13;
control center, which in turn will advise and recommend actions to be taken in contingency situations,&#13;
where necessary in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&#13;
24.  In coastal areas, MCS would be more intensive than in the offshore areas due to the greater&#13;
number of vessels and the diversity of fishing gears. In addition to enforcing the implementation of&#13;
fisheries management plans, the coastal MCS function should include resolution of conflicts betwoe&#13;
vessels which use 'mobile' gear (mainly the industrial and inshore fishermen), and those that use&#13;
"static' gear (exclusively canoe fishermen) because of the damage inflicted on the static gear by the&#13;
mobile gear; such conflicts have resulted in several deaths in the past.&#13;
25.  For land-based patrols, two pick-up trucks would be needed. The trucks should be equipped&#13;
with radio, winches and tow bars capable of pulling an inflatable boat on a light trailer.&#13;
26. Coastal MCS should focus on public relations leading to dialogue with fishers on the need for&#13;
conservation, and on convincing the Chief Fishermen that it would be in their community's long-term&#13;
interest to adopt reasonable fishing practices fishing.&#13;
27. Inland Fishery MCS Functions. In the inland areas, the MCS priority should be enforcing the&#13;
provisions of the Fisheries Law relating to fishing practices and techniques, monitoring trends in the&#13;
fishery, collecting limnological data, and identifying problem areas and attempting to solve them with&#13;
the cooperation of the fishers through the extension service. Resolution of problems can more&#13;
effectively be done through dialogue with and consent of the fishing communities concerned.&#13;
28.   Stafflng. The staff of the MCS Division should include Fisheries Inspectors, administrative,&#13;
clerical and computer data processing staff. The DOF lacks personnel with the necessary&#13;
background, training, and expertise to fill the posts of inspectors, and hence the staff would have to&#13;
be recruited. However, before recruiting any additional staff, the Departnent should explore the&#13;
possibility of training existing staff and reassigning them to the new unit. Potential sources of now&#13;
recruits, should that option be adopted, include surplus Merchant Navy mariners and redundant nval&#13;
personnel.&#13;
29. Command and Control Center. Day to day fisheries MCS operations could be directed and&#13;
coordinated from an operations room normally known as control, command, communications, and&#13;
information center. The room would contain a wall chart for plotting current situation reports;&#13;
normal office equipment including a photo-copier, a desk top computer with work procoeing &amp;ad&#13;
spreadsheet software, and the base station of communications network (satellite communicatiou&#13;
equipment should be provided to the field stations as well). Although the majority of industrial&#13;
fishing vessels operate on a 24-hour basis, it would not be necossary to staff the conter on twenty-fw&#13;
hour basis provided a senior officer is on call during non-office hours equipped with mobilo&#13;
telphone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;

30.   Technical Assistance. A comprehensive MCS system requiring coordinated efforts of several&#13;
agencies, similar to the one proposed above, is difficult to establish and initiate. This is particularly&#13;
so in Ghana since there has not been sufficient experience in MCS. Therefore, short-term&#13;
consultancies would be needed for setting the system, and initiating its implementation.&#13;
Maintaining the MCS System&#13;
31.    Once the MCS system is put in place and the initial start up period is passed, implementing&#13;
the system is fairly easy and routine, provided adequate funds become available to sustain it. The&#13;
ultimate beneficiaries of a well functioning MCS system are those who earn their livelihood from the&#13;
industry, and they should make financial contributions to maintain the system. So far, they have not&#13;
been contributing much. Their only contribution has been in the form of license fees charged to the&#13;
mechanized fleet. The fee, which is computed as a percentage of the value of catch, totalled only&#13;
USS 20,000 equivalent in the latest year for which data are available. The data for the most recent&#13;
three years are shown below:&#13;

In comparison to the above license fees, license fees charged for similar fisheries elsewhere (e.g.&#13;
long-liners in the Indian Ocean) is around US$4,000 per calendar month; purse-seiners of 1,500 gross&#13;
register tons and over, which fish the seasonal itinerant yellow fin and big-eye, are charged over&#13;
US$50,000 per month. Had the Ghanaian vessels been charged similar rates, as much as USS2&#13;
million would have been recovered in 1993.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECI&#13;
Economic and Financial Analysis&#13;
A. Economic Analysis&#13;
Linkages Between Project Activities and Expected Benefits&#13;
1.   The quantifiable benefits are based on the expected impact of the institutional, management,&#13;
legal, financial, extension and enforcement measures to be introduced under the project; the relative&#13;
importance and role of each specific fishery; the best scientific data available on the current and likely&#13;
future biological state of the fisheries resources; and actual price data collected for each fishery by&#13;
comprehensive regular and frequent surveys. Non-quantifiable benefits include protecting and&#13;
strengthening the fishing-dependent communities by reinforcing a strong forward and backward&#13;
linkages that exist in the sector. The project would also widen the horizons and perspectives of the&#13;
staff of DOF, provide a wider and more varied career path and open up the operation of DOF to a&#13;
wider range of professional disciplines that were not practiced before. The institutional strengthening&#13;
program and a sound fisheries management regime will also enable DOF to introduce a licensing fee,&#13;
royalty or levy system to recover at least the costs of the management of the fisheries and eventually&#13;
any economic rent that may be generated through the operation of the management regime.&#13;
2.    The reorganization, staffing and training at DOF will be essentially completed by year two of&#13;
the project; fisheries resources management plan, some elements of which are assumed in the&#13;
analysis, and monitoring, control and surveillance and enforcement services will also be in place by&#13;
the end of year two of the project.&#13;
3.   With respect to each fishery, the following additional assumptions were made:&#13;
(a)    Small Pelagics. The project will introduce registration and licensing of all fishing&#13;
vessels, including artisanal canoes, which catch the bulk of the small pelagic resources.&#13;
It will also introduce self management in the fishing communities through the well&#13;
established fishers' associations and the traditional authority of the Chief Fisherman.&#13;
On Lake Volta, illegal fishing nets and other devices, such as bamboo traps,&#13;
proliferate the fishery and need to be eliminated. Registration and licensing of canoes&#13;
under the project will be an important first step towards controlling activity and access&#13;
to the fishery. Without management, the stocks are likely to decline over time as&#13;
increasing numbers of flshers enter the fishery and become more effective and&#13;
efficient. This would put pressure on the resource from over-fishing of the stocks and&#13;
fishing of juveniles, thus reducing recruitment, and lead to declining profitability and&#13;
the possibility of significant social dislocation as a result of impacts on fishing-&#13;
dependent communities. Self management is the accent but MCS activities to be&#13;
introduced under the project will back the agreed management plan. With good&#13;
management, it is expected that there will be a longer term increase in the pelagic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

resources available to be harvested from both marine and inland fisheries. The&#13;
objectives would be to regulate the number of canoes, and possibly the number of&#13;
fishing days for each vessel, particularly during the recovery and spawning periods,&#13;
and to enforce appropriate and legal fishing nets and practices. The estimated benefit&#13;
from the marine pelagics is 10 percent of the value of the average catch over the past&#13;
five years (123,000 tons), which would accrue beginning the fourth year of the project.&#13;
This is a conservative assumption in the light of the current activity in this fishery.&#13;
Various estimates for the Lake Volta, from 4,800 tons to 20,000 tons, have been put&#13;
forward as likely future production increases from a well-managed pelagic lake fishery.&#13;
It has proven difficult to arrive at a single reliable estimate. For the purposes of&#13;
analysis, it is estimated that the sustainable recovery will begin in year three of the&#13;
project and reach 4,800 tons annually by year five.&#13;
(b)    Demersal Resources. A key assurance to be given by govermment during negotiations&#13;
(and an element which is expected to be a permanent feature of the management plan)&#13;
is the removal from inside the 30 meter depth line of all trawlers in excess of 50 gross&#13;
registered tonnage not later than June 30, 1996. This measure and other appropriate&#13;
management practices will allow the recovery of these resources and the establishment&#13;
of a higher Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and therefore increased catches. The&#13;
total annual catch of demersal species by all fleets has averaged some 42,000 tons over&#13;
the past five years, with the highest recorded catch being 59,000 tons in 1975. Under&#13;
appropriate management, the demersal fleets could produce up to 70,000 tons per year,&#13;
but an increase in the MSY of 15,000 tons in the longer term is a more reasonable&#13;
expectation. This can occur with no reduction in fishing effort other than the removal&#13;
from inside the 30 meter depth line of trawlers in excess of 50 gross registered&#13;
tonnage. A greater increase in the recovery of the demersal fishery is possible, but a&#13;
more conservative approach should be adopted in the short term, at least until the&#13;
research and MCS activities are in full operation. It has been assumed, therefore, that&#13;
a modest stock recovery will occur beginning in the fourth year of the project,&#13;
increasing the sustainable yield by a total of 15,000 tons three years after that. There&#13;
will be additional economic and financial benefits from reduced gear conflicts, and an&#13;
artisanal fleet that will operate more efficiently as a result. There will also be a&#13;
reduction in the catch of juveniles through the enforcement of fishing gear restrictions.&#13;
(c.    Crustaceans and Shrimps. The stocks of crustaceans and shrimps are currently over-&#13;
fished and can be expected to decline further without effective management. The&#13;
management plan, to be prepared with technical assistance under the project, would&#13;
allow the recovery and subsequent expansion of these fisheries, which in total are&#13;
capable of producing an additional 1,000 tons of catch. These species tend to have a&#13;
high value, and small increases in allowable catches can produce very positive results.&#13;
The increase can be expected to begin in the fourth year of the project, with the&#13;
recovery being maximized three years thereafter.&#13;
(d)    TLna. An expansion of this fishery is highly likely regardless of the project. The&#13;
furti.er development of this fishery will largely depend on future trends in world&#13;
market prices. However, a management regime to be introduced under the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

would provide stability and a degree of certainty in the enviromment for private sector&#13;
planning. This is likely to encourage investment in the fishery. With increased&#13;
investment, an uncontrolled or unrestricted expansion would cause biological and&#13;
economic problems at a later date. These problems could well include over-fishing of&#13;
the resource, or at the very least involve an uneconomic expansion of capacity with a&#13;
consequential dissipation of any economic rent generated by the effective management&#13;
of this resource. It would be prudent to provide a management framework within&#13;
which the development of this fishery could take place. However, no benefits from&#13;
this fishery, other than fiscal revenues, have been included in the project benefit&#13;
stream for purposes of computing the ERR.&#13;
4.    The incremental physical benefit streams (in thousands of tons), based on the expected stock&#13;
recovery, are summarized below:&#13;

Prices and Markets&#13;
5.    The market for fish in Ghana and the rest of the world is expected to remain strong. Total&#13;
fish consumption in Ghana has increased trend-wise from 249,000 tons in 1984 to 383,000 tons in&#13;
1993. Up to 1991, consumption was less than total fish catch out of Ghanaian waters but the situation&#13;
has changed since 1992, when consumption begun outstripping production. Imports have risen&#13;
steadily from 500 tons in 1986 to 37,000 tons in 1993. Some of the high value demersal, tuna and&#13;
crustacea/shrimp species, which until recently were all exported, now sell on the local market. With&#13;
higher domestic prices relative to export prices, more fish tend to be sold on the domestic market and&#13;
vice versa. Tuna exports as a percent of catch increased each year from 70 percent in 1985 to 86&#13;
percent in 1988 but has since declined to 56 percent in 1993 as more is off-loaded on the domestic&#13;
market due to rising real prices. All the projected increase in catches will be sold on the domestic&#13;
market and will offset potential increases in fish imports. Without the project, it is expected that the&#13;
increased demand for fish would reduce exports and place considerable pressure on the fishing sector&#13;
to increase its effort to catch more fish with likely disastrous consequences both for the resource and&#13;
for the fishers.&#13;
6.    Prices for different species caught in the same fisheries differ and exhibit wide daily and&#13;
seasonal fluctuations. They are lowest at the peak of the fishing season (August), and highest during&#13;
December/January. The prices used in the analyses represent the average prices for the last three&#13;
years weighted heavily by the lowest value species in each fishery. They also weigh heavily towards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
prices prevailing during the peak harvest period, when prices tend to be at their lowest. For example,&#13;
most demersal species have an average price range over the fishing year of US$16,660 (August) to&#13;
US$18,330 per ton (December/January) for sikaska specie, and US$13,330 to US$15,000 per ton for&#13;
cassava specie. However, in the analysis, the incremental benefits in the demersal fishery are valued&#13;
at US$700 per ton, heavily weighted by the lower value boritto species and reflecting more of August&#13;
prices. Prices for small pelagics of US$400 per ton reflect more of the lower value anchovy species&#13;
than the higher value sardinella species, which fetch over US$800 per ton and account for half of the&#13;
small pelagics harvest. For crustacea and shrimps, a price of US$5,000 per ton was used although&#13;
shrimp fetches upwards of US$7,000 a ton. These market prices at fish landing points are border-&#13;
price equivalents used for all valuations of benefits, and there are no differences between financial and&#13;
economic prices. Although these prices can be expected to increase in real terms, given Ghana's&#13;
preference for fish as a source of protein, increases in population and higher incomes, a conservative&#13;
approach has been adopted, and the prices are assumed to remain unchanged during the period of&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return &amp; Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
7.    The economic cost and benefit streams are shown in Tables 1 and 2.&#13;
In carrying out the analysis the following assumptions, in addition to those already discussed above,&#13;
were made:&#13;
(a)    The benefit streams for each fishery have been combined in different ways to gain a&#13;
more accurate assessment of the most likely outcome, and to ensure that the project&#13;
benefits are not overestimated. The most realistic outcome assumes that the only&#13;
benefits directly attributable to the project are those arising from the recovery in the&#13;
demersal fisheries.&#13;
(b)    The benefits are expected to commence in the fourth year of the project and be phased&#13;
in over the succeeding four years. This takes into account the expected recovery time&#13;
for the fishery resources.&#13;
(c)    The project's life has been set at fifteen years.&#13;
8.    At a discount rate of 12 percent the project produces a NPV of US$ 28.1 million for the&#13;
minimum expected recovery, that of the demersal fisheries. With the recovery of all fisheries, the&#13;
project yields a NPV of US$80.2 million. The corresponding Economic Rates of Return (ERR) are&#13;
44.8 percent (demersal) and 80.2 percent (all Fisheries).&#13;
9.    The main risks to the anticipated benefits are biological, financial and institutional. The most&#13;
important risk factors are biological. The assumed level and timing of the recovery of the biomass in&#13;
various fisheries has been conservatively estimated. Nevertheless, the actual recovery could be&#13;
adversely or favorably affected by unforeseen and uncontrollable environmental factors, such as&#13;
upwelling, in the case of small pelagics. The financial risk is a possible shortage of counterpart&#13;
funds; it Is a general public finance problem that affects all the agricultural portfolio. The&#13;
institutional risk relates to the capacity of the DOF; it is weak relative to the task at hand and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
although the project directly addresses this issue, changes in management and administrative processes&#13;
and culture may not occur at the pace assumed. A potential risk to project like this one, in which&#13;
increase in fish catch is ultimately the justification for instituting measures for stock recovery, is the&#13;
possibility of soft markets and prices for the fish. Such risks are considered minimal in this&#13;
operation.&#13;
10.  The biological risks in the form of a weaker-than expected or delayed recovery due to&#13;
environmental factors are partly addressed by measures under the project: protection of spawning&#13;
grounds from fishing, enforcement of mesh and gear standards and banning the use of traps and&#13;
explosives in fishing, are designed to protect juveniles, and to enhance recruitment in the various&#13;
fisheries and recovery of the fish biomass. On project finance, Government has indicated that the&#13;
shortage of counterpart funds Is a short-term problem, that it in no way implies the sector's low&#13;
priority in the public investment program, and-that it does not expect the problem to continue. In any&#13;
event, the project would also generate additional public revenue, depending on the level and timing of&#13;
the recovery of the fisheries, some of which could be used to finance the public expenditures in the&#13;
sub-sector. On institutional weakness, strengthening of the capacity of DOF is a major component of&#13;
the project. Many of the actions needed to strengthen capacity of the DOF so it can implement other&#13;
parts of the project will be taken up-front: adoption of the re-organization plan and new structure of&#13;
DOF as well as assignment of all substantive implementing managers were conditions of negotiations&#13;
and were fulfilled; and most of the training and technical assistance and other institution-building&#13;
activities are front-loaded. During implementation, IDA and the Borrower would also conduct&#13;
detailed annual reviews of implementation, where the focus would be advance identification of&#13;
problems and solutions, including assessing changes in institutional capacity and prospects for&#13;
counterpart funding.&#13;
11.  If the biological, financial and institutional risks materialized to adversely affect the project, in-&#13;
spite of the mitigating features in the project design discussed above, they would delay and weaken&#13;
the strength of the recovery of the fish stocks in the various fisheries. The sensitivity analysis is&#13;
based on the probable impact of the risks to the project in their order of significance and their&#13;
likelihood to materialize. To assess the sensitivity of the project results to the biological, financial&#13;
and institutional risks, the following changes were made to the parameters:&#13;
(a) volume estimates were reduced by 25 percent, and&#13;
(b) the benefits were assumed not to commence until year six.&#13;
12.  A weaker than expected recovery, reflected in a 25 percent reduction in fish biomass at fill&#13;
recovery, would reduce the NPV of the project for the base case to US$18.6 million and the ERR to&#13;
36.9 percent. Deferring the conmnencement of benefits from year four to year six would reduce the&#13;
NPV to US$17.2 million and the ERR to 29.8 percent.&#13;
13.  Market and price risks are very unlikely to materialize. However, the sensitivity of the net&#13;
benefit stream to a possible softening of markets and prices was assessed by reducing prices 20&#13;
percent. This reduces the NPV to US$20.5 million and the ERR to 38.6 percent for the base case.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
14.   Combining reduced volumes of catch, delayed commencement of benefits, and reduced real&#13;
prices by 20% would yield NPV of US$10.3 million and an ERR of 25.3 percent.&#13;
B. Financial Analysis&#13;
Project's Financial Impact on a Cross-Section of Fishers&#13;
15.   Based on a combination of vessel types, scale of activity, fish species targeted and destination&#13;
of the catch, four categories of fishers can be identified: industrial tuna fishers; large trawlers; semi-&#13;
industrial fishers-inshore vessels; and artisanal canoe fishers. Available industry data shows that&#13;
except the tuna fishers, most of the fishing enterprises and artisanal fishermen are at present in a state&#13;
of financial stress, particularly the semi-industrial inshore fishers. Following removal from the rich&#13;
waters off the Namibian and Angolan coast, the large Ghanaian trawler fleet is also experiencing&#13;
financial problems, although some have recently diversified into fish imports.&#13;
16.   The project in one way or another will affect each of the above groups of fishers on the&#13;
revenue and cost sides of their operating accounts. On the revenue side, the group that would be&#13;
least affected, particularly in the short-to medium term, are the tuna fishers as the project has the least&#13;
direct impact on them. The revenue of inshore and canoe fishers will be boosted as their catch&#13;
increases with the recovery of the fisheries in response to the implementation of the fisheries&#13;
management plan; the only uncertainty is the timing of the recovery. In the short run, the revenues&#13;
of the large trawlers, who are currently fishing illegally inshore, may be adversely affected as they&#13;
are pushed outside the 30 meter depth, which is critical to the recovery of the demersal fisheries. On&#13;
the cost side, semi-industrial inshore and canoe fishermen would see their marginal costs of catching&#13;
additional fish come down as they would travel shorter distances, stay at sea shorter periods and&#13;
utilize the capacity of the vessels more fully and save on fuel; since the removal of the premix fuel&#13;
subsidy, fuel constitutes the largest element of fishing costs. Its use would be reduced as the&#13;
demersal and small pelagics inshore fisheries recover. The operating costs of the large trawlers,&#13;
however, will likely increase as they are forced to operate further out at sea. In the long run, even&#13;
the large trawler fleet should benefit financially from the project as all the fisheries recover. In&#13;
addition, the Ghana Government has indicated that relief to the large trawlers may be on the way&#13;
through negotiations of bilateral fishing rights with other countries in the region where the trawlers&#13;
can fish as they did off Namibian and Angolan coast before the extension of the EEZ.&#13;
17.   The policy reform introduced under the project of a fishing royalty adds to the business costs&#13;
of all fishers, except the artisanal canoe fishermen who would not be affected. Being based on actual&#13;
catch, the royalty levy is progressive so that those fishers who do not do well in physically catching&#13;
the fish will not be burdened with fixed taxes. Also the phasing in of the levy, beginning as late as&#13;
June 1997, is meant to give affected fishers enough time to plan and the levies would not be increased&#13;
unless the comprehensive review, scheduled for mid-1998, establishes the need and feasibility for any&#13;
increases. The additional cost to the fishers would be more than offset by the benefits, in the form of&#13;
higher private net income, derived from the public resource management regime that it is intended to&#13;
finance. Tbe artisanal canoe fishermen, who account for about 65 percent of the fish catch, derive&#13;
the largest net financial benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
Project's Impact on Public Revenues and Expenditures&#13;
18.  The project would increase the public expenditures in the sub-sector from the current level of&#13;
about US$500,000 per year to about US$1.2 million per year by the end of the project. The project&#13;
would also generate substantial additional revenues. A new fisheries royalty levy equivalent, to one&#13;
percent of the gross landed value of the fish catch, will come into effect by June 30, 1997. Since the&#13;
artisanal canoe fishermen are exempt from this levy initially, from a practical point of view the levies&#13;
will apply mainly to harvest of tuna, dermersal and crustacea and shrimp; they will be paid by the&#13;
industrial and semi-industrial fleet. Small pelagics and inland fisheries, which are mainly exploited&#13;
by artisanal canoe fishers, would make minimal contribution.&#13;
19.  Fiscal revenue from royalties is projected to increase from US$250,000 in 1997 to US$0.8&#13;
million per year at the end of the project's implementation phase if the rate remains at one percent of&#13;
the gross landed value of catch. This would be a major reform given that the sector currently&#13;
contributes only about US$20,000 to revenue. At project maturity, the revenue contribution would be&#13;
more than 1.2 times the recurrent cost needs of running the new fisheries management regime from&#13;
year 2001. The net present value of the fiscal benefits of the project at a 12 percent rate of discount&#13;
is US$1.2 million.&#13;
Modality for Collection of Fisheries Levies&#13;
20.  The exemption of the numerous traditional artisanal canoe fishers from the new royalty levy&#13;
simplifies the necessary machinery for collection. Basically the process will involve two agencies of&#13;
government: the Department of Fisheries and the Internal Revenue Service. The DOF, which has&#13;
responsibility for collecting, processing and maintaining fisheries data will collect statistics on fish&#13;
catch by each vessel and each company/business and report it to the IRS on a monthly basis. The&#13;
IRS will bill the fishers on a quarterly basis.&#13;
21.   About 10 percent of the funds would be deposited in the present Fisheries Development Fund&#13;
into which duties on imported fish are currently deposited. These funds would be used for upgrading&#13;
facilities and services at the fishing community level. In time, when registration/license fees and/or&#13;
royalties payments are extended to canoe fishers, collection costs incurred by the fishers' associations&#13;
and the Chief Fisherman can be financed out of this fund. Provision of services to the fishing&#13;
communities financed out of this fund up-front would militate against opposition to fees that canoe&#13;
fishers could be made liable to in the future. Transparency in the use of these funds on approved&#13;
fisheries facilities and services will be critical to the success of the program. The fishers' associations&#13;
and the powerful traditional authority of the Chief Fisherman in the fishing communities would be&#13;
involved upstream in identifying community needs to be financed with these funds. As services to the&#13;
communities improve and the fisheries recover and the management plan is understood, a modest&#13;
canoe registration fee could be introduced during the operational phase of the project.&#13;
Financial Analysis of Representative Aguaculture Farm Models&#13;
22.   Aquaculture is financially viable, as demonstrated by the following models which represent the&#13;
cross-section of types of farms. Four models are presented: (a) an integrated fish-vegetable-cassava&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64-&#13;
ANNEX 14&#13;
Page 8 of 8&#13;
farm (typical of the south and middle belts), (b) an integrated fish-rice farm (typical of the north and&#13;
upper north belts), (c) a mono-culture fish farm, and (d) a fingerlings production farm.&#13;
23.   All ponds are manually excavated earth ponds stocked with tilapia, catfish and mud-fish. Pond&#13;
construction is generally undertaken by family labor supplemented by some hired labor paid for in&#13;
kind. The same applies for harvesting with the labor supplied by the farmer and his family. Stock&#13;
for the pond is traditionally obtained from 'wild" sources at minimal cost but allowance has been&#13;
made in the analysis for the purchase of quality fingerlings. The major source of feed for the&#13;
operation is from on-farm waste at zero cost. Allowance has been made, however, for the purchase&#13;
of some feed and fertilizer. On the more specialized farms, mostly prevalent in the Ashanti Region,&#13;
more inputs are purchased such as fingerlings and feed. Gross returns range from 45 percent to over&#13;
100 percent, with the highest for fingerling production. The major limiting factor to expansion of&#13;
aquaculture is slow diffusion of the technology to small farmers and the risk involved particularly&#13;
when not integrated with crop culture, the culture that the farmer is more familiar with.&#13;
24. Integrated Fish-Vegetable-Cassava Farm. The model farm is approximately 190 square meters&#13;
and the fish culture period is eight months. Details are in Tables 3.&#13;
25.  Integrated Fish-Rice Farm. The farm is of 0.2 ha rice plot and the fish is cultured for four&#13;
months following rice harvest. Details are in Table 4.&#13;
26. Pure Fish Production Farm. The farm is of mixed sex culture of Oreochromis niloticus and&#13;
cafish cultured in 100 days. Details are in Table 5.&#13;
27.   Fingerlings Production Farm. The farm produces fingerlings of tilapia 0. niloticus based on a&#13;
six months cycle operation of a 0.0262 ha hatchery. Details are in Table 6.&#13;
28.   Results from Other Studies of Ghana Aauaculturt Farm Models. FAO has carried out studies&#13;
of private fish farming in Ghana. The latest, published in 1994, focussed on larger farms in the&#13;
Accra region and other farms of varying sizes in Ashanti region, including those that are engaged in&#13;
integrated fish/poultry farming and integrated fish/piggery farming. The data from these farm models&#13;
provide further evidence that aquaculture in Ghana can be financially rewarding if properly managed.&#13;
A key element for success nas been identified as up-front advice to farmers in pond sight selection&#13;
and construction as well as pond and overall farm management. In particular, integrated&#13;
fish/vegetable/poultry and piggery farming, with appropriate extension support, can be very&#13;
profitable. Markets are not a problem as the demand for fresh water fish is so strong that fish is in&#13;
many cases ordered and sold prior to harvest.&#13;

Government's Letter of Sub-Sector Policy&#13;
Mr. Lewis T.Preston&#13;
President&#13;
The World Bank&#13;
1818 H Street, N.W.&#13;
Washington D.C. 20433&#13;
USA&#13;
Dear Mr. Preston:&#13;
1.   The purpose of this letter is to outline for you the main features of our policy for managing the&#13;
fisheries sub-sector. In conjunction with programs of adjustment, IDA has assisted the Government&#13;
of Ghana with various credits to strengthen economic management. In agriculture, the Agricultural&#13;
Services Rehabilitation Project (ASRP), laid the foundation for better policy formulation, planning,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. We now have a Medium Term Agricultural Development Program, which&#13;
was developed in consultation with IDA, in the context of which our programs and projects, including&#13;
this proposed Fisheries Project, are designed and implemented. The ASRP also was an important&#13;
first step in strengthening operational capacity of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA).&#13;
Now that the adjustment program has corrected most of the policy distortions in the macro and&#13;
agricultural sector, we intend to continue emphasis on removing structural obstacles to investment by&#13;
the private sector. In the fisheries sub-sector, more institutional strengthening need to be initiated in&#13;
order for the Fisheries Department and related institutions to carry out the mandate of fisheries&#13;
resources management and development.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    A number of pertinent policy and exogenous developments have impacted the fisheries sector&#13;
which I would like to apprise you of as background to the proposed operation. Ghana's Economic&#13;
Recovery Program (ERP), supported by IDA since its launching in 1983, has encouraged private&#13;
sector activities and sought to minimize the role of government in the direct provision of goods and&#13;
services, including the supply of fishing gear. It also encouraged non-traditional exports, including&#13;
fish and other marine products. The result of these measures has been increased fish harvesting on the&#13;
continental shelf using illegal but highly profitable small mesh size nets. On the international scene,&#13;
West and South-Western African countries, the traditional fishing grounds of the Ghanaian trawler&#13;
fleet, recently imposed restrictions on the Ghanaian registered deep sea fleet through enforcement of&#13;
the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). With its traditional fishing grounds closed,&#13;
the Ghanaian large industrial trawler vessels, the smaller semi-industrial in-shore fleet and the canoe&#13;
artisanal fleet all fish on the narrow continental shelf, seriously threatening the demersal fisheries.&#13;
Although the Fisheries Law requires the trawlers to fish in the outer sea, beyond the 30 meter&#13;
contour, the Fisheries Department lacks the capacity to enforce this provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
ANNEX IS&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Furthermore, with the cessation of the Government's supply of the legal mesh size nets and the&#13;
superior profitability of the illegal nets, juveniles of many fish species are being harvested resulting in&#13;
a low rate of regeneration. This is posing serious dangers particularly to canoe fishing. The&#13;
Fisheries Department lacks the capacity for monitoring and surveillance to enforce the law relating to&#13;
fishing gear.&#13;
3.    While some fisheries resources, such as tuna species, appear to be in no immediate danger and&#13;
others, such as cuttlefish beyond the 30 meter contour, are under-exploited, there is evidence that the&#13;
in-shore marine resources are being over-harvested. The lack of definitive and consistent policy in the&#13;
past resulted in the implementation by Government of fisheries projects and programs that tended to&#13;
promote broad exploitation of marine resources, including those that are particularly endangered. At&#13;
present, the various objectives of government policy in the fisheries sector appear to be at least&#13;
partially conflicting and unattainable. Their reconciliation in a comprehensive resource management&#13;
plan and implementation in a reformed, enabling regulatory and institutional framework are urgent&#13;
matters. This is the genesis of the proposed fisheries sector capacity-building project.&#13;
Obiectives of Government Policy&#13;
4.    Government policy in the fisheries sector aims at: increasing fish production for local&#13;
consumption and export, consistent with the long-term sustainability of the resource; alleviating&#13;
poverty in the fishing communities; development of resource management plans for the entire&#13;
fisheries sector; integration of fishing activities in the farming system through the promotion of&#13;
aquaculture; privatization of assets and operations of public bodies engaged in direct fishing or in the&#13;
supply of fishing gear; and, strengthening the Department of Fisheries so that it can effectively carry&#13;
out its mandate, particularly relating to the above tasks. In pursuing its accelerated growth objectives,&#13;
to raise GDP annual growth rate from 5 percent to 8-10 percent, government wishes to increase the&#13;
contribution of agriculture, with fisheries as an important source of growth.&#13;
5.    The Government would promote gender-sensitive development strategy and carry out programs&#13;
that particularly address rural and urban poverty as well as women-centered economic disadvantages.&#13;
The proposed project is a key instrument in the advancement of this policy in many ways: without&#13;
the project and the possible collapse of the demersal fishery and its associated canoe fishing activities,&#13;
major urban areas and nucleus settlements along the coast and the Volta Lake would become areas of&#13;
concentrated poverty; the dominance of women in fish processing, preservation and marketing in&#13;
Ghana is well known and few projects could be more women-oriented than a project such as this,&#13;
aimed at ensuring the long term sustainability of canoe-based fishing.&#13;
6.    All projects should be consistent with the Government's environmental policy, which is&#13;
designed to ensure sound management of resources to avoid any exploitation of resources in a manner&#13;
that might cause irreparable damage to the environment. The policy provides for: maintenance of&#13;
ecosystems and ecological processes essential for the functioning of the biosphere; sound management&#13;
of natural resources and the environment; protection of humans, animals and plants and their habitat;&#13;
guidance for healthy environmental practices in the national development effort; integration of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

environmental considerations in sectoral structural and socio-economic planning at all levels; and&#13;
common approach to regional and global environmental issues. The fundamental aims of the&#13;
environmental policy would be pursued and achieved through harmonization and enforcement of&#13;
relevant laws and treaties on the environment, and through the implementation of our Environmental&#13;
Action Plan.&#13;
Strategy for Achieving Policy Objectives&#13;
7.    General. We intend to undertake or promote the following reforms and programs: pursue a&#13;
private sector oriented strategy to the utilization of fisheries resources and divest public sector&#13;
commercial assets and concerns; provide necessary services through appropriate public/private sector&#13;
interface so as to create an enabling environment in which private sector activities will flourish,&#13;
particularly in the area of aquaculture; remove policy bottlenecks to increased exploitation of the tuna&#13;
resources and promote private investment in the rehabilitation and expansion of the tuna fleet, so as to&#13;
increase exports; promote, through extension and other support services, private smallholder&#13;
investment in aquaculture so as to improve fish supply and consumption, especially in the hinterland,&#13;
and reduce rural poverty; using foreign trade and diplomatic channels, promote joint ventures between&#13;
Ghanaian and foreign investors in trawl fishing, so as to obtain foreign fishing rights for the Ghanaian&#13;
trawler fleet and stop its over-exploitation of in-shore demersal fisheries; rationalize exploitation of&#13;
both marine and freshwater fisheries resources; amend and update the fisheries law so as to facilitate a&#13;
regulatory framework in which the fisheries management plan would be effectively carried out; and,&#13;
restructure, equip and strengthen the Department of Fisheries and related institutions and fishers&#13;
groups so they can effectively implement the fisheries management plan, including monitoring,&#13;
control and surveillance, services which hitherto have been lacking and which the proposed project&#13;
seeks to establish and support.&#13;
8.    Privatization and Divestiture. Under our on-going adjustment program, the Government is&#13;
committed to divestiture of its commercial concerns and assets as part of its strategy to foster private&#13;
sector-led growth. In the fisheries sector, Government no longer supplies premix fuel, nets or any&#13;
other fishing gear as these activities have been completely privatized. All subsidies to fishing inputs&#13;
have been removed, including the subsidy to the premix fuel for canoe fishers which was removed in&#13;
1994. The State Fishing Corporation, the largest state commercial concern in the sector, has been&#13;
privatized.&#13;
9.    Fisheries Policy and Public Finance. At present, the fisheries sector's contribution to public&#13;
finance is well below its rated potential. Only the large industrial fleet and the semi-industrial in-&#13;
shore vessels are licensed and pay fees at very nominal rates. They also account for only about 20&#13;
percent of the total annual marine fisheries catch. The bulk of fishing activities, carried out by&#13;
artisanal canoe fishermen, are unlicensed and contribute little to government revenue. It is now&#13;
Government policy to require that all vessels operating in Ghanaian waters be registered and pay fees&#13;
for the privilege of fishing. These fees, to be set at or revised to an appropriate level, taking into&#13;
account the present financial condition of the fishing enterprises, are an integral part of the proposed&#13;
reforms to be supported by the proposed project. In any event the canoe registration process will be&#13;
a necessary step to implementing a stocks management plan.&#13;

10.   Fisheries Policy and Legislation. The evolution of fisheries policy and implementation of the&#13;
fisheries management plan, to be prepared in the context of the proposed project, require updating&#13;
and, in some cases, amendment of existing Fisheries Law and regulations. It is Government policy to&#13;
secure the necessary legislative reforms and to promulgate new or amend existing regulations to&#13;
facilitate a legal and regulatory framework that is conducive to the carrying out of all aspects of the&#13;
fisheries management plan, including: revision(s) to the law to clarify the role, powers and duties of&#13;
the Fisheries Commission and the Department of Fisheries; and, provision for regulations to cater to&#13;
those areas which are subject to change from time to time due to management requirements.&#13;
11.   Fisheries Policy and Institutional Reform. We recognize that in order to effectively carry out&#13;
continuous stocks assessment, draw up management plans and carry them out, restructuring of the&#13;
Department of Fisheries will be necessary. This reform will be designed to establish, staff and equip&#13;
a new division, the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Division (MCS), to ensure that activities&#13;
on the water bodies conform to the legal and physical objectives of the fisheries management plan.&#13;
The necessary ministerial order will be published establishing the MCS in the Department of&#13;
Fisheries. Existing divisions within the department will be strengthened through training and&#13;
logistical support to enable them to carry out their functions.&#13;
12.   Industrial Tuna Fishing Policy. Government policy aims at continuing promotion of this&#13;
activity, even in the short-run, to promote exports as the tuna fishery resources are under-exploited.&#13;
Tuna fishing has been constrained by: low world market prices, which are now beginning to recover,&#13;
and insufficient credit in the face of low cash positions of the tuna companies. The recovery of&#13;
international prices and resumption of tuna processing by the USA-based Star Kist corporation,&#13;
which buys the tuna from Ghanaian vessels, has begun to restore profitability to some enterprises.&#13;
Government will continue to promote joint ventures and investment in local tuna processing and&#13;
canning enterprises.&#13;
13.   Industrial Trawler Fleet Policy. Having been excluded from Angolan, Namibian and West&#13;
African deep sea fisheries in the EEZ framework, this fleet came home and is fishing on the&#13;
continental shelf alongside the in-shore and canoe fishing. Gear conflict is common and in spite of&#13;
the legal requirement that the fleet not fish inside the 30 meter contour, the fleet has caused damage&#13;
to the demersal fisheries. Government policy will focus on removing the trawler fleet to the outer&#13;
sea, where under-exploited resources are available. A key element of this policy will be the&#13;
enforcement of existing fisheries laws and regulations relating to fishing restrictions in the continental&#13;
shelf. The proposed MCS will be a first important step in this direction. A parallel policy effort is a&#13;
joint approach by the Government and the private sector to negotiate bilateral fishing agreements with&#13;
other countries.&#13;
14.   Semi-industrial In-shore Fishing. In-shore fishing enterprises are at present experiencing&#13;
distress. It is estimated that about half of the entire fleet is grounded for lack of&#13;
marine engines or spare parts at affordable or financially profitable prices. Their plight has been&#13;
aggravated by depletion of the inshore fisheries due to over-fishing, requiring more&#13;
fishing effort for declining catches at the same time as the cedi operating expenses have been rising&#13;
much faster than the market price of fish. Government policy will focus on relief in&#13;
the medium-term to semi-industrial operators through enforcement of the 30 meter exclusion of large&#13;
trawlers and implementation of other aspects of the overall fisheries management plan aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
ANNEX 15&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
restoring the demersal stock. Only then will this category of fishing start reaping returns in the form&#13;
of increased catch per fishing effort.&#13;
15.   Artisanal Canoe Fishing. There are an estimated eight-to nine thousand canoes operating in&#13;
marine waters harvesting approximately eighty percent of the total marine fish catch. The canoe fleet&#13;
on the Volta Lake, numbering some fifteen thousand assorted vessels, catches about 15 percent of&#13;
total domestic fish. The social consequences of the collapse of canoe fishing are underlined by the&#13;
national dependence on fish for over 60 percent of protein in-take and the near total dependence of&#13;
large settlements along the coast and the Volta Lake on fishing or associated activities. Thus it is&#13;
national policy to prevent any possible collapse of these fisheries and to promote their sustainable&#13;
harvest. As with the semi-industrial in-shore activity, canoe fishing is in distress due to rising&#13;
operational costs, relative to increases in fish prices, and depleted fish stocks. Government policy&#13;
aims at assisting canoe fishing through implementation of fisheries management plans that will, among&#13;
other things, help the recovery of in-shore demersal resources. We will also work with the traditional&#13;
leadership in the fishing villages in improving the management of the resources.&#13;
16.  Inland Fisheries Policy. Inland fisheries comprise lakes, rivers, lagoons, estuaries and&#13;
aquaculture, with the Volta Lake as the dominant fishery (about 90 percent of inland fish catch). The&#13;
problem of over-fishing identified in marine fisheries are equally serious on the lake. Government&#13;
intends to carry out stock assessments, prepare a management plan and continuously monitor its&#13;
implementation. The proposed MCS activities will also cover the lake and inland fisheries in general.&#13;
Aquaculture and other fisheries in the smaller inland water bodies offer an opportunity to improve&#13;
nutrition in the hinterland and increase incomes of the small farmer in the context of the mixed&#13;
integrated fish/crop/livestock activities. It could develop into an instrument to directly address&#13;
poverty. Data from on-going activities and pilot tests have demonstrated that with the proper&#13;
technology and management aquaculture can be financially and economically viable. Government&#13;
policy is to pursue an integrated approach to the development of inland fisheries through extension in&#13;
the framework of MOFA's Unified Extension. It is also our intention to involve a number of non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs), which have acquired aquaculture expertise, in the extension&#13;
effort. The fisheries laws and regulations, which at the moment are silent about the whole area of&#13;
aquaculture, will be appropriately amended to define the framework in which aquaculture will be&#13;
promoted and regulated.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
17.   I hope you will find this summary of our policies and progress made so far in attaining the&#13;
objectives satisfactory.&#13;
Sincerely yours,&#13;
Hon. Kwesi Botchwey&#13;
Minister of Finance&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Fisheries Sub-Sector Capacity
            Building Project will establish the long-term sustainability
            of the fisheries resource and thereby maximize its
            contribution to the economy. To achieve this, the project
            will strengthen the capacity of the Department of Fisheries
            (DOF) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) for
            managing the sub-sector focusing on: formulation of policy
            and management plans and their implementation: monitoring,
            control, surveillance and enforcement; and the promotion of
            the development of inland fisheries. This will require
            strengthening of the DOF through reorganization and staff
            training; stock assessment, and preparation and
            implementation of management plans for the marine and inland
            fisheries; improvement of extension and aquaculture
            including the use of improved quality fingerlings;
            establishment of a Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance
            (MCS) system for marine and inland fisheries; and reform of
            the policy, legal and regulatory framework in the sub-sector
            to improve management, enhance private investment, and
            promote sustainable catches of fish.
