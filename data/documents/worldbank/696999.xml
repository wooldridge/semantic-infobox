            Post-privatization performance - regulating

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Privatized in 1984, British
            Telecommunications (BT) is the longest-standing privatized
            utility in the United Kingdom.  Comparing BT's stock
            market returns over a long period with returns for a
            comparable sample of firms not affected by regulation, the
            author assesses whether the new telecommunications
            regulatory regime has been "captured" (unduly
            influenced) by consumer groups, BT, or BT's competitor.
            He concludes that some regulatory decisions have favored
