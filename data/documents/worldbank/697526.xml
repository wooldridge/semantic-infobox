This report is based on the findings of identification, preparation and appraisal missions that visited&#13;
Bolivia during 1993-1994, led by Mr. Felipe Saez (LA3PS). The workshops on reform strategies and&#13;
judicial administration conducted with representatives of the Bolivian Judiciary were critical elements for&#13;
the appraisal mission's findings and recommendations. Key participants in the missions and contributors&#13;
to the report were Ms. Lisette Price and Mr. Andres Cuneo. Valuable support in the production of the&#13;
report was provided by Mmes. Martha Gonzalez, Mayela Rojas and Sharon Spriggs (LA3PS).&#13;
Messrs. Krishna Challa and Yoshiaki Abe are, respectively, the Division Chief and Department Director&#13;
for this operation.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Bolivia has made substantial progress toward establishing a basis for accelerated&#13;
and efficient economic growth. The economic adjustment program implemented since the&#13;
mid-1980's has succeeded in restoring macroeconomic stability and stimulating moderate&#13;
growth. Inflation has declined steadily, reaching an estimated 8% per annum in 1994.&#13;
Growth averaged 3.8% during 1991-1993 and is estimated to have reached 4.2% in 1994.&#13;
Despite recent improvements, however, growth rates must be accelerated in order to&#13;
improve the welfare of Bolivia's people, especially of those at low-income levels. A major&#13;
determinant of the slow pace of growth has been the low level of private investment,&#13;
averaging just 5% of GDP in 1991-1993 and estimated at 6.3% in 1994.&#13;
2.    Two main factors explain these low levels of private investment: (i) the&#13;
predominance of public enterprises in key sectors with strong growth potential; and (ii) the&#13;
lack of a legal and institutional framework to guarantee private agents the consistent and&#13;
predictable enforcement of their rights. These two factors are related; since major sectors&#13;
of the economy were effectively closed to private participation, the framework for&#13;
enforcement of private contracts was of secondary importance. On the other hand, the&#13;
real dimension of the inefficiencies derived from the poor legal and institutional structure&#13;
has been disguised, thus reducing the impetus for reform.&#13;
3.    To address the first issue, the new administration has launched a bold program of&#13;
privatization, using a process called capitalization, aimed at rationalizing the role of the&#13;
state in sectors where private investment and management could improve efficiency and&#13;
accelerate growth. It is supported by the Bank Group through a proposed Capitalization&#13;
Program Adjustment Credit and accompanying technical assistance operations. Important&#13;
improvements in the investment environment are expected from the program. Its success&#13;
and further development of the private sector, however, would be reinforced by reform of&#13;
the institutions that guarantee the rules of the game for private sector activity. Judicial&#13;
reform is a central priority within this agenda.&#13;
4.    Widespread public discontent with the justice system has given rise to a number of&#13;
recent reform measures. Until now, these reform initiatives have been mainly legislative&#13;
and have been driven by the other branches of government, the Executive and Congress.&#13;
In early 1993, a new Law of Judicial Organization was approved which reformed the&#13;
procedures for appointment of Supreme Court justices. It also called for the establishment&#13;
of specialized courts in tax, mining, labor and social security law. In September of that&#13;
year, a Ministry of Justice was created. Most recently, the new administration introduced&#13;
reforms to the Constitution that included an institutional restructuring of the Judiciary&#13;
through the introduction of a specialized Constitutional Tribunal and a Judicial Council&#13;
responsible for the sector's administration. In a notable cooperative effort, the Judiciary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
and the Executive, represented by the Ministry of Justice, have now agreed to embark on a&#13;
far-reaching Judicial Reform Program to include institutional and administrative, as well as&#13;
legislative measures.&#13;
I. THE JUDICIAL SECTOR&#13;
PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.     Public confidence in the Bolivian justice system is very low, as evidenced by the&#13;
results of a 1991 survey.' Litigants face inordinate delays in obtaining adjudication of&#13;
disputes, leading to generalized public disinclination to seek judicial enforcement of legal&#13;
rights. Court decisions are not based on uniform and predictable standards, generating&#13;
uncertainty about the application of legal provisions and the terms under which judicial&#13;
disputes are adjudicated. In addition, major groups in the society have very limited access&#13;
to the formal system of justice, yet alternative dispute resolution mechanisms are not well&#13;
developed.&#13;
6.     These problems stem from a variety of causes, discussed in more detail below.&#13;
Structural problems include weak judicial autonomy - the result of a history of executive&#13;
supremacy and political patronage - and perverse incentives caused by inadequate human&#13;
resource management. In addition, specific problems at the court level, as identified by&#13;
participants in workshops conducted during project preparation, include: (i) the passive&#13;
role assumed by judges in managing judicial processes; (ii) judges' weak professional skills,&#13;
(iii) the absence of standards and information for case management; and (iv) deficient&#13;
court organization and administrative support.&#13;
ORGANIZATION&#13;
7.     The Constitution of Bolivia and the 1993 Law of Judicial Organization provide the&#13;
basic legal framework defining the structure, authority and functions of the judicial branch&#13;
(see Annex 1). Until recently, the structure has been relatively simple in terms of&#13;
functional diversity and hierarchical levels. An expanding share of social and economic&#13;
activity has been left without recourse to effective dispute resolution mechanisms,&#13;
generating increasing pressure on the judiciary to deal with complex and specialized&#13;
matters. In response to this pressure, recent legislative initiatives have tried to compel&#13;
specialization within the judiciary. The new Law of Judicial Organization mandates the&#13;
establishment of specialized courts in various fields of law, while the reforms to the&#13;
Constitution call for the establishment of a specialized constitutional court as well as a&#13;
council that would assume responsibility for management of the judicial branch. The&#13;
judiciary's capacity to implement these reforms, however, has been limited.&#13;
8.     At the head of the sector is the Supreme Court, in theory a court of cassation - a&#13;
tribunal of last resort that annuls lower courts' decisions if the principles of due process&#13;
have been violated. In practice, however, cases brought before the Court are not filtered&#13;
1.     The 1991 ILANUD-Bolivia survey of litigants, lawyers, law students, prosecutors, and judges&#13;
found that 84% of respondents believed the process of justice was too slow, while 74% thought it was&#13;
politically influenced. Of lawyers, 92% agreed that corruption existed, as did 53% of judges; 48% of&#13;
litigants claimed to have made illegal payments to court personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
according to their precedent-setting relevance. The Court therefore invests a substantial&#13;
share of its resources in routine review of decisions by the District Courts, leading to an&#13;
overlap of functions and causing the Court to neglect its responsibility for setting policies&#13;
and precedents for the sector.&#13;
9.    The Judicial Branch faces the dual challenge of improving the quality of its&#13;
traditional dispute resolution services and at the same time developing specialized tribunals&#13;
for emerging judicial needs. The strategy agreed with the Executive allows the Judiciary&#13;
to concentrate on improving traditional services of civil and commercial dispute resolution&#13;
as its immediate objective, while developing in-house institutional capacity to formulate&#13;
plans for further strengthening justice administration. The Executive will assume&#13;
responsibility for implementing the constitutional reforms, and will encourage the&#13;
development of commercial arbitration as a short-term response to the needs for&#13;
specialized dispute resolution. In the medium term, it is expected that the build-up of&#13;
institutional capacity will enable the Judiciary to formulate and implement programs to&#13;
cope with the rising need for specialized dispute resolution.&#13;
ECONOMICAND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES&#13;
10.   The weakness of the judicial system in Bolivia has reduced investment by adding to&#13;
perceived risk and to the cost of market transactions. Public faith in the courts is so low,&#13;
and the cost of using them so high, that parties often forgo legitimate claims and shoulder&#13;
substantial losses rather than submit a dispute to judicial adjudication. Equity and social&#13;
welfare are also negatively affected.&#13;
11.   The poor performance of the courts has reduced the volume and efficiency of&#13;
market transactions. One example is the reduced number of loans made by banks because&#13;
of problems with debt collection through the courts. Because of the uncertainty caused by&#13;
inadequate enforcement mechanisms in Bolivia, economic activity has been biased towards&#13;
short-term ventures, with investors favoring quick-return financial and trading activities to&#13;
investments in fixed assets.&#13;
12.   In the absence of effective formal enforcement, economic agents have come to rely&#13;
on informal factors, such as long-standing family or personal ties, in doing business. This&#13;
oflen leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. Banks in Bolivia, for example, tend to&#13;
be part of financial groups that control companies in one or more sectors. In the past,&#13;
insider firms have had preferential access to credit, in particular to cheaper longer-term&#13;
credit, so that investment was not always undertaken by those with the most promising&#13;
opportunities. The importance of maintaining business reputation has encouraged the&#13;
continued operation of loss-making operations, deterring the reallocation of assets&#13;
towards more profitable ventures.&#13;
13.   The reputation-based system that prevails in Bolivia also has significant equity&#13;
consequences. It is biased against new entrants, such as small-scale entrepreneurs and&#13;
foreign investors. Since it is based on existing social structures, it tends to magnify&#13;
existing inequities in the society. It leads to growth that benefits mainly the rich and&#13;
worsens income distribution. The courts as they function at present also contribute to this&#13;
inequity. A system driven by bribes favors the party better able to afford these payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
It also creates a bias in favor of the wrongdoer, for whom the marginal benefit of&#13;
influencing the judicial outcome is always higher.&#13;
14.   The ineffectiveness of civil courts has also led to the abuse of criminal procedures&#13;
as a means to achieve enforcement of commercial obligations. A review of criminal cases&#13;
brought before the courts in La Paz during the period 1990-92 shows that over 67% of&#13;
new criminal claims (6,243 cases) arise from commercial disputes. The conversion of&#13;
commercial obligations into criminal cases, however, further inhibits the willingness of&#13;
economic agen.s to incur legitimate commercial risks, since criminal responsibility may&#13;
ensue.&#13;
JUDICIAL A UTONOMY&#13;
15.   The Supreme Court has overall responsibility for governing the Judiciary, including&#13;
relations with the Executive and Legislative Branches. Bolivian Constitutions have&#13;
invariably recognized the independence of the Judiciary, including the explicit recognition&#13;
of its economic autonomy since the 1965 Constitution. However, the Judicial Branch was&#13;
severely affected by the institutional and political instability that prevailed in Bolivia until&#13;
the last decade. Aside from a period of stability in the first part of this century, the&#13;
Judiciary has been periodically subjected to overt intervention by the political&#13;
establishment or the military. During 1950-1982, the membership of the Supreme Court&#13;
was renewed seventeen times. This history of instability has contributed to the weak&#13;
institutional culture that has prevailed in the Judicial Branch. Conditions changed notably&#13;
with the advent of democracy in 1982. The legislative and executive branches adhered to&#13;
constitutional provisions governing the appointment and permanence of judges.&#13;
Nevertheless, judicial appointments continued to be based more on partisan and regional&#13;
patronage than professional excellence. The effect on the quality of leadership and social&#13;
prestige of the judiciary has been marked.&#13;
16.   Despite widespread public insistence on the need for judicial reform, the lack of&#13;
leadership within the judiciary meant that until recently it was making little progress&#13;
towards improving justice administration. Responding to public pressure, the political&#13;
establishment embarked on the first of a series of legislative attempts to improve the&#13;
situation. In February 1993, Congress approved a new Judicial Organization Law,&#13;
including a provision designed to check the importance of political patronage in the&#13;
appointment of justices to the Supreme Court. The law now requires that a two-thirds&#13;
majority (formerly a simple majority) of the Senate nominate Supreme Court candidates,&#13;
effectively limiting the power of any one party to dominate the Court. Another provision&#13;
of the law curbed the Supreme Court's right to levy taxes or user charges, but safeguarded&#13;
the judiciary's economic autonomy by earmarking a minimum of three percent of the&#13;
national budget for the judicial branch.&#13;
17.   In early 1993, five new justices, chosen according to the recently approved&#13;
procedures, took seats on the Supreme Court. There was overall consensus that the new&#13;
voting requirements had resulted in a far more transparent and constructive selection&#13;
process. Public perception is that the new justices meet higher professional and personal&#13;
integrity standards. This partial renewal of the Court's membership has resulted in a Court&#13;
more willing and able to undertake a comprehensive reform program, thus decreasing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
likelihood of confrontations between a reform-mind  ±dministration and defensive&#13;
judiciary.&#13;
18.   It is expected that the nominees to four positions on the court that remain vacant&#13;
would be chosen in the coming weeks. This will further contribute to the renovation of&#13;
the Court's membership, and should improve the prospects for a sustained commitment to&#13;
judicial reform.&#13;
19.   Continuing its legislative initiatives, Congress approved in August 1994 a&#13;
constitutional reform law that included an institutional remodelling of the judiciary. One&#13;
of the most important changes is the introduction of a Judicial Council, headed by the&#13;
President of the Supreme Court and including four other counselors appointed by&#13;
Congress. This Council will assume responsibility for administration of the judicial&#13;
branch, including formulation of the budget. Most importantly, it is charged with&#13;
preparing the lists for the appointment of judges at all levels, another step forward in&#13;
removing the delicate matter ofjudicial appointments from the political domain.&#13;
HUMAN RESOURCE MANA GEMENT&#13;
20.   Until the recent constitutional reform, the Supreme Court had exclusive&#13;
responsibility for handling personnel management issues within the judiciary. With the&#13;
introduction of the Judicial Council, an institutional niche has been created for personnel&#13;

however, avoid&#13;
becoming a bloated bureaucracy (see Figure 1). In Bolivia, the population:judge ratio&#13;
compares favorably with other countries in the region, while its support staff:judge ratio is&#13;
2.5 to 1, indicating a rather lean bureaucracy.&#13;
21.   Regional considerations played an important role in the Supreme Court's decisions&#13;
on personnel matters. Decisions on recruitment and career advancement were handled by&#13;
the justice(s) from the relevant region. There were no established policies guiding&#13;
personnel-related decisions. In the last year, some of the newly appointed justices have&#13;
initiated implementation of a basic performance evaluation system to assess the&#13;
qualifications of judges up for reappointment. While the system has some shortcomings, it&#13;
marks the first attempt to introduce guidelines for personnel management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
22.   The absence of sound practices for personnel management, combined with the low&#13;
prestige of the judiciary, has resulted in low quality and effectiveness of staff. At all levels&#13;
of the system, a significant number of judges have poor proficiency and skills. As is the&#13;
case with the judiciary's operational performance, no institutional data were available on&#13;
the profile and basic characteristics (educational background, performance record) of&#13;
judicial personnel, despite the fact that the law mandates the operation of such a system.&#13;
23.   The deficiencies in human resource management described above give rise to an&#13;
incentive framework that thwarts professionalism and, at the very least, discourages&#13;
efficient and principled performance of staff working in the judicial branch. Recruitment,&#13;
promotion and performance evaluation in the judiciary have been undertaken in an ad hoc&#13;
and discretionary manner. Political patronage and regional interests are the main forces&#13;
driving personnel decisions, outweighing consideration of professional excellence, probity&#13;
and administrative effectiveness. Compensation does not seem to be a decisive factor&#13;
contributing to poor performance. Salaries in Bolivia, although relatively low by&#13;
international standards, seem at least competitive and possibly higher than comparable&#13;
public sector salaries.&#13;
24.   The 1993 Judicial Organization Law has already contributed to mitigating political&#13;
control of senior judicial appointments. The legislative changes, including the creation of&#13;
the Judicial Council, provide a window of opportunity to improve human resource&#13;
management in the judiciary. The establishment of a judicial career system, designed to&#13;
recruit professionals who possess judicial-grade skills and to promote performance at the&#13;
highest standards of professionalism and honesty, would constitute a key element of the&#13;
proposed judicial reform program. It is expected that implementation of the judicial career&#13;
system, especially the introduction of competitive recruitment and promotion practices,&#13;
would lead to a replacement over a period of four years (the regular term for judicial&#13;
appointments) of a substantial share of incumbent judges.&#13;
JUSTICE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
25.   The judiciary in Bolivia is a highly rigid bureaucracy, lacking institutional capacity&#13;
in planning and strategic management. The prevailing managerial culture is a reactive one,&#13;
with no well defined corporate strategy or objectives that would guide the allocation of&#13;
institutional resources. Budgets are prepared from year to year based on past resource&#13;
allocation, with marginal changes derived from political and regional pressures.&#13;
26.   The Judicial Branch has developed very limited organizational structures for&#13;
planning and administering its operations. These structures are concentrated at the&#13;
Supreme Court level. The main policy-making body on these matters is the Administrative&#13;
Council, composed of the Chief Justice and three other justices. In practice, however, the&#13;
Council does not seem to play an important role. The Judicial Treasury, which in theory&#13;
reports to the Administrative Council, in practice holds most decision-making authority&#13;
regarding budget and financial matters, with limited scrutiny from the Administrative&#13;
Council. This situation is expected to change with the establishment of the Judicial&#13;
Council whose main function will be to manage the resources of the Judicial Branch. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Council will also have direct authority over the Judicial Treasury, and will be responsible&#13;
for formulation of the budget of the Judicial Branch.&#13;
27.   The historical lack&#13;

Figure 2: Population/Judge Ratios by Department         Department of Pando is&#13;
four times higher than in the Department of La Paz.&#13;
28.   There is also a strong bias against rural areas in the allocation ofjudicial resources&#13;
in virtually every department. On average, urban judges serve a population of 14,517&#13;
person, whereas rural judges attend a population of 19,882 persons, despite the wider&#13;
dispersion of their client populations. This confirms the inaccessibility of the judicial&#13;
branch to low-income rural communities. The judiciary has no institutional initiative to&#13;
improve responsiveness to these groups. This should constitute a high priority among&#13;
future institutional strategies.&#13;

which will contribute to further delays in justice administration. A system must be&#13;
designed for resource allocation decisions that would take into account backlogs and the&#13;
need to assign resources based on demand for services. Future institutional strategies to&#13;

priority.&#13;
III. THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM&#13;
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORx&#13;
30.   The Bolivian Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) largely reflects modern principles of&#13;
judicial management. Its driving postulate is that judges have primary responsibility for&#13;
ensuring that cases are concluded within legally mandated deadlines. This basic principle&#13;
of the CCP -in contrast with traditional theories that place the primary initiative on the&#13;
parties and assign the judge a passive role- has been reinforced by granting judges the&#13;
power to, inter alia: (i) cut off any incidental proceedings deemed by the judge to be aimed&#13;
primarily at delaying proceedings; (ii) play an active role in fact-gathering and in weighing&#13;
the evidence produced; (iii) promote the shortening of cases through the concentration of&#13;
proceedings; (iv) seek settlement of the dispute through active conciliation; and&#13;
(v) interpret procedural rules so as to guarantee the legal rights of the parties.&#13;
31.   The CCP also regulates in detail the sequencing and timing of each stage of the&#13;
judicial process. Annex 2 provides time flows of the two main judicial proceedings, the&#13;
ordinary and executive processes. These time flows are based on the duration assigned by&#13;
law for each of the judicial stages. They show that if the legally mandated deadlines were&#13;
to be followed, the first instance of an ordinary process would not last more than 167&#13;
days. Case reviews by the District Courts and Supreme Court would not exceed 97 days&#13;
and 147 days respectively. The first instance for an executive case would not last more&#13;
than 42 days.&#13;
32.   The CCP establishes penalties for judges who do not meet these legally mandated&#13;
deadlines, such as negation of their authority to decide a case and adverse performance&#13;
evaluations. These sanctions were made harsher by the 1993 Law of Judicial&#13;
Organization. Despite legislative intentions, however, actual application of any sanction is&#13;
very rare. This is in part a result of the failure to monitor compliance and, mostly, of the&#13;
low priority given to enforcing these deadlines within the judiciary.&#13;
33.   Attempts by the legislator to regulate the judicial process in detail reflect public&#13;
dissatisfaction with the judiciary's performance. By the time the CCP was elaborated in&#13;
the early 1 970s, there was consensus in the drafting commission that the only way to&#13;
increase the swiftness of justice administration was to give judges greater responsibility for&#13;
case management. On the other hand, the commission was fully aware of the risks of&#13;
increasing judges' authority with the deficiencies in professionalism prevailing in the&#13;
Bolivian judiciary. As discussed below, it is clear that the attempt to reach a purely&#13;
legislative solution to this dilemma did not succeed.&#13;
34.   Despite its overall modernity, the Bolivian CCP does depart from more progressive&#13;
procedural systems in two aspects: a heavy reliance on written proceedings and a&#13;
digressive nature. This is in contrast to the modem tendency to make the judicial process&#13;
hearing-based and issues-oriented. Although orality and process concentration are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
envisaged in the CCP for purposes of fact-finding and conciliation, these are seen as&#13;
anomalies in an otherwise dispersed and written procedure. Nevertheless, if these two&#13;
oral opportunities were exploited, they could have a substantial impact on the quality and&#13;
celerity of case adjudication. A more assertive interpretation of the CCP regarding judges'&#13;
authority in managing the judicial process would permit the Supreme Court to instruct&#13;
judges as a matter of policy to concentrate various stages of the proceedings in hearings,&#13;
instead of relying on written presentations. Such adjustments to the judicial process&#13;
within the prevailing legislative framework would constitute a priority activity in the&#13;
implementation of the reform program.&#13;
REALITY&#13;
35.   The day-to-day reality of civil cases bears little relation to the normative ideals of&#13;
the legislators of the CCP. The average civil procedure extends well beyond the CCP's&#13;
standards. A time flow study2 conducted in La Paz shows that on average, the first&#13;
instance of an executive process (a collection procedure) lasts ten times longer than the&#13;
CCP guideline (519 vs. 42 days). In the same way, the first instance of an ordinary&#13;
procedure lasts more than 3.5 times the period established in the CCP. Appeals before&#13;
District Courts and before the Supreme Court on ordinary procedures are 568% and&#13;
466% longer than envisaged under the CCP. An ordinary process that goes through the&#13;
three instances of judicial review lasts on average 2,616 days, or more than 7 years.&#13;

tribunal is assigned 22%.&#13;
According to the study,&#13;
Figure 4: Case Time Allocations per CCP                 however, the first instance&#13;
tribunal uses 34% of the&#13;
time, while the time attributable to litigants is reduced to 7% of the total case processing&#13;
time (see Figures 4 and 5). The two appellate levels -assigned by the CCP 34% of&#13;
processing time- use 54% of real processing time. Similar disparities arise in the executive&#13;
procedure.&#13;
2.     The study was financed by the Bank Group and carried out by the Universidad Cat6lica de&#13;
Bolivia as part of the preparation effort. It reviewed a random sample of 155 civil cases (83 executive and&#13;
73 ordinary) in the District of La Paz and focused on determining the average processing time of the main&#13;
stages of cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
37.   According to the time&#13;
flow study, justice delay is           ORDINARY PROCEDURE&#13;
mainly a result ofjudges'                Real Time Allocations&#13;
passivity in condoning                         Summons&#13;

review was spent in dealing            29%&#13;
with incidental matters raised&#13;
by the litigants. Another                   District      Litigants&#13;
26% of the case processing                   Court           7%&#13;
time was spent in                            25%&#13;
certifications by the court's&#13;
secretary, at the request of    Figure 5: Real Case Time Allocations&#13;
the judge, of matters already documented in the case file. This practice is widespread&#13;
among judges as a device to postpone judicial decision-making despite its explicit&#13;
prohibition in the law. Similar allocation of the case processing time applied in the case of&#13;
ordinary proceedings.&#13;
38.   The study also indicates that only a small fraction of cases end with a court-&#13;
mandated payment to the claimant. The high level of desertion of judicial claims is one&#13;
indication of plaintiffs' disappointment with judicial procedures. The moral hazard&#13;
incentives provided by courts to defendants lead claimants to a handicapped settlement or&#13;
abandonment of the claim in a high percentage of cases.&#13;
39.   Judges also systematically relinquish to the parties the fact-gathering&#13;
responsibilities assigned to them in the CCP. The time flow study indicates an average of&#13;
six months of the ordinary proceeding is spent in the fact-finding stage (as opposed to the&#13;
50-day maximum prescribed in the CCP). Judges remain removed from the fact-gathering&#13;
process. They do not examine witnesses or request the production of additional evidence&#13;
for analysis of the facts. Most of the fact-gathering activities are delegated to clerks who&#13;
lack the training and ability to ensure that these are carried out in a technically sound and&#13;
fair manner.&#13;
THE ROOTS OF THE CRISIS&#13;
40.   During a workshop sponsored by the Supreme Court and held in Cochabamba in&#13;
March 1994, the conclusions of the time flow study were reviewed. Workshop&#13;
participants, consisting of fourteen leading representatives of the judiciary and legal&#13;
profession, identified five main factors explaining the dismal performance of the judiciary&#13;
in managing civil proceedings.&#13;
41.   The Role of the Judge. The judicial branch has failed to define institutional&#13;
objectives and appropriate judicial standards for implementation of the CCP mandate.&#13;
Junior judges receive no clear policy signals from senior courts on this matter. In fact,&#13;
senior tribunals are often themselves poor performers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
42.   By default, the judiciary has continued to embrace a ritualistic and passive&#13;
approach to the judicial process, the model prevailing prior to the introduction of the CCP.&#13;
Instead of directing the proceedings with the objective of achieving an early adjudication&#13;
of the dispute, judges have retained a passive and distant role in the management of the&#13;
judicial process. By and large, they permit dilatory motions put forward by the parties&#13;
without any regard to their merits or relevance; do not seek or promote conciliation; and&#13;
have delegated to court clerks the phases of the process where the issues of controversy&#13;
and evidence are defined. The distant role played by judges in the conduct of the process -&#13;
stemming in part from the fact that judicial proceedings are conducted almost exclusively&#13;
in writing- has implied that judges acquire direct knowledge of the case only when it has&#13;
reached the stage of final decision. The environment in which judicial processes are&#13;
conducted has become unproductive and conducive to filibuster by the parties. Due&#13;
process principles have been construed by judges so as to condone the delaying tactics of&#13;
the delinquent party. The high transaction costs imposed by the judiciary on the party&#13;
attempting to enforce his/her rights create a systemic bias in favor of the delinquent party.&#13;
43.   The workshop concluded that the judiciary needed to define policies related to the&#13;
handling of the judicial process that would seek an adequate balance between formal due&#13;
process requirements (giving the defendant adequate defense opportunities), substantive&#13;
due process objectives (ensuring that judges have early and first-hand knowledge of the&#13;
substantive issues in dispute and provide both parties equal treatment in the protection of&#13;
their substantive rights) and the timely resolution of disputes.&#13;
44.   Professional Education and Skills. The judiciary has carried out very limited&#13;
initiatives aimed at providing judges with adequate training to perform their duties. A&#13;
1991 survey conducted by ILANUTD provides some relevant insights regarding the&#13;
personal and professional profile of Bolivian judges3, including in the area of judicial&#13;
education. The survey covered a total of ninety-five judges4 (equivalent to 23% of judges,&#13;
excluding Supreme Court Justices) from the nine regional jurisdictions. The picture&#13;
presented in the area of judicial educational is disappointing. Over 92% of judges&#13;
surveyed completed their law degree and had no further exposure to university-level&#13;
studies. The remaining 8% had completed studies in Philosophy and Literature. Most&#13;
judges had not participated in any form of training activities. Those that had participated&#13;
(less than 4%) had done so on sporadic and limited occasions.&#13;
45.   Despite the recent establishment by the Judicial Organization Law of a Judiciary&#13;
Institute to provide judicial training, no plans have been agreed for putting it into&#13;
operation. It is the judiciary's position, as reflected in the program, that in the medium&#13;
term, judicial training efforts should be directed primarily at strengthening the judges'&#13;
professional know-how and skills in judicial process reform. Judicial training would&#13;

Instrucci6n de la Repuiblica de Bolivia", ILANUD, February 1992.&#13;
4.     The sample included 15 District Court judges, 41 Circuit Court judges and 39 Junior Circuit&#13;
Court judges. It provided adequate coverage of urban and rural, criminal, civil and general jurisdiction&#13;
judges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
constitute a critical instrument for implementing the judicial process reforms mandated by&#13;
the Supreme Court.&#13;
46.   Judicial Incentives. A major cause of judges' poor performance is the perverse&#13;
incentive structure created by haphazard selection and promotion mechanisms. Judicial&#13;
appointments and career advancement seem to be a function mostly of political or personal&#13;
connections. No mechanisms are in place to track or reward professional excellence or&#13;
outstanding performance. The only differentiated compensation incentive is linked to&#13;
years of service, with no reference to performance during those years.&#13;
47.   The ILANUD survey referred to above found an average duration of employment&#13;
ofjudges, including clerical and judicial functions, of 10.5 years. Stability on the job&#13;
seems more fragile, however, when the issue of permanence of judges in individual&#13;
assignments was assessed. Only 40% of judges interviewed had been in their current&#13;
positions over four years (thus, beyond their original appointment) and only 10% remained&#13;
in their positions over eight years. Again there was no explicit link between permanence&#13;
and professional excellence.&#13;
48.   The survey also provided some insights on recruitment and career advancement&#13;
patterns prevailing in the judiciary. Over 46% of judges surveyed had become judges after&#13;
serving an initial period as clerks. The same pattern did not hold, however, with regard to&#13;
further advancement within the judicial ranks. Only 22% of the judges surveyed had&#13;
previously worked as judges in a lower-level court.&#13;
49.   The lack of a career pattern in the judiciary is further reflected in the significant&#13;
asymmetry between age and seniority. In career-oriented organizations, a match between&#13;
age group and seniority is normal. In the Bolivian judiciary, there is a significant mismatch&#13;
between these variables. Age of incumbents is systematically higher than warranted by the&#13;
respective positions. These results coincide with anecdotal references that the judicial&#13;
branch is an attractive retirement alternative for public sector legal professionals. The&#13;
workshop concluded that the design of a performance evaluation system aimed at&#13;
rewarding or penalizing staff based on performance would be a necessary factor for&#13;
promoting professional competence.&#13;
50.   Institutional Feedback. Information gathered by the courts is fragmented and&#13;
irrelevant for purposes of allowing judges to monitor individual case progress and overall&#13;
court performance. There are also serious doubts about the reliability of data as there are&#13;
no special personnel or specific guidelines for maintaining court statistics. Data collected&#13;
at the tribunal level are rarely aggregated at the District Court and Supreme Court levels.&#13;
Thus, the judicial leadership does not incorporate into its planning process any form of&#13;
feedback regarding quality and opportunity in the provision of justice services or the&#13;
judiciary's ability to cope with demands for justice.&#13;
51.   Courtroom Management Capacity. Weak administrative support to the tribunal's&#13;
judicial adjudication function was identified as another element contributing to poor&#13;
judicial performance. The workshop found three main factors that contributed to&#13;
administrative malfunctioning, namely: the lack of professional staff, the failure to define&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
the tribunal's administrative functions, organization and staffing; and serious shortcomings&#13;
in the process-serving function.&#13;
52.   Recruitment and career advancement in the clerical ranks is shaped by the&#13;
preferential access to those positions given to law students. When this preference was&#13;
granted, it was believed that students could contribute to efficient court administration&#13;
while reinforcing their academic training. In practice, however, the indiscriminate use of&#13;
law students to fill administrative positions and the lenient selection and supervision&#13;
practices of the courts have led to an unfortunate situation: law students have become&#13;
major contributors to the inefficient administrative performance of courts. This is in part&#13;
the result of the temporary nature of their assignments (one to two years), the lack of&#13;
training and managerial guidance of court clerks and the perverse incentives that govern&#13;
court administration. The 1993 Law of Judicial Organization requires that the principal&#13;
clerical position in each tribunal be filled by a lawyer. This initiative is being partially&#13;
implemented by the Supreme Court. It would, by incorporating the role of administrator&#13;
into the professional career stream within the judiciary, constitute an important step&#13;
towards improved standards for the judicial administration function.&#13;
53.   Another critical element is the failure to define the functions, organization and&#13;
staffing for courtrooms at the different levels. A study of courtroom organization could&#13;
provide the basis for an efficient division of functions and definition of minimum&#13;
requirements for each position. Workshop participants recommended that reorganization&#13;
of the courtroom should include a redefinition of the process server function, since&#13;
existing incentives are completely perverse. Currently the server is expected to finance&#13;
from his/her own resources the transportation costs related to the service, thus, creating a&#13;
strong incentive for deferral of a key judicial function or, as is repeatedly the case, an&#13;
incentive for seeking illegal economic retribution.&#13;
IV. JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
54.   The overarching goal is to create a judicial system that contributes to economic&#13;
growth by facilitating private sector activity, and to social welfare by guaranteeing the&#13;
basic rights of all citizens. In order to achieve this goal, the existing bureaucracy must be&#13;
transformed into a modern, service-driven organization capable of:&#13;
* resolving disputes expeditiously;&#13;
* issuing decisions based on sound interpretation of legislation, jurisprudence and&#13;
recognized principles of equity; and&#13;
* responding to the society's evolving needs for justice administration.&#13;
STRATEGY&#13;
55.   The agreed reform strategy takes into account the particular circumstances of the&#13;
Bolivian judicial sector, as well as the experience with judicial reform in other countries.&#13;
Judiciaries in Latin America have been wont to ascribe deficiencies in justice&#13;
administration to the shortage of resources assigned to the judicial branches. Experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
in the region has shown, however, that an increase in resources does not necessarily&#13;
generate improvements in the quality and celerity of judicial services. In the United&#13;
States, reform strategies have focused on providing judges with the technology and&#13;
specialized personnel needed to permit "managerial judging".&#13;
56.   The difficulties faced by the Judicial Branch in Bolivia will require a comprehensive&#13;
and paced reform strategy. As in the case of the "managerial judging" initiatives, the&#13;
strategy would aim to increase efficiency through improved courtroom administration.&#13;
However, the strategy also takes into account the need to seek improvements in the&#13;
quality of the justice provided by the present system. Thus, its foundation is reform of the&#13;
judicial incentive framework and of the judicial process itself, thereby striking the&#13;
necessary balance between quality and efficiency issues.&#13;
57.   To achieve the objectives set out above, the reform effort will need to be sustained&#13;
over several years and phases. The first phase, to be supported by the proposed credit,&#13;
will last three years and will focus on establishing the institutional and policy framework&#13;
for reform. Within this phase, activities will aim at establishment and strengthening of&#13;
judicial institutions, improvements in human resource management and courtroom&#13;
administration, and quality improvements in judicial procedures. IDA's support of reform&#13;
efforts in civil law areas will work in conjunction with an ongoing USAID project focused&#13;
on criminal justice. Subsequent phases would expand quality improvement efforts,&#13;
building on changes introduced in the first phase, but reinforced by an overhaul of&#13;
procedural codes. Later efforts would aim to increase the level of specialization of&#13;
Bolivian courts in areas such as mining, tax and administrative law.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
58.   Interest in this comprehensive reform program as well as the responsibility for its&#13;
implementation, are shared between the Executive and Judiciary. The Executive views&#13;
judicial reform as an integral component of its plan of government, supporting its&#13;
economic reform objectives as well as its aim to modernize state institutions. The recent&#13;
partial renewal of the Supreme Court has resulted in a Judiciary more willing and able to&#13;
undertake comprehensive reform. Together the Executive and Judiciary have agreed on a&#13;
reform strategy that defines their respective roles based on the constitutional separation of&#13;
powers and their comparative advantages.&#13;
59.   Consequently, the Judiciary will take the lead on all issues involving the daily work&#13;
of the courts, including judicial management systems. The Executive will assume&#13;
responsibility for implementation of the recent constitutional reforms, for seeking&#13;
legislative reforms complementary to the Judiciary's efforts, and for establishing and&#13;
promoting extra-judicial mechanisms for dispute resolution.&#13;
60.   The recent creation of a Ministry of Justice with direct responsibility for&#13;
coordinating relations with the Judiciary is expected to facilitate communication between&#13;
the two branches of government. The Supreme Court, for its part, has established an&#13;
Executive Council5 with responsibility for policy matters related to the reform program,&#13;
5.    The Council includes two Justices of the Supreme Court, the Minister of Justice or his&#13;
representative, three District Court judges and the President of the National Bar Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
and has included the Minister of Justice or his representative as a full member of the&#13;
Council. In addition to these measures, which are expected to improve coordination&#13;
between the two branches, the most important step has been reaching full agreement on&#13;
the activities that each will pursue independently. Based on this accord, the Executive has&#13;
agreed to take on an IDA credit and transfer approximately 70% of the proceeds to the&#13;
Judicial Branch in the form of a grant.&#13;
61.   The Executive Council inaugurated its activities with a three-day workshop on&#13;
Strategies for Judicial Reform, in March 1994. The workshop aimed at reaching&#13;
consensus among Council members on the issues facing the judiciary and defining a&#13;
judicial reform strategy. The event was highly successful. The Council's Report&#13;
containing the objectives, components and priorities for judicial reform has been endorsed&#13;
by the Supreme Court and provides the basis for the proposed judicial reform program.&#13;
The Supreme Court has delegated to the Committee broad policy setting and investment&#13;
authority. The functions, membership and powers of the Committee are described in an&#13;
Internal Resolution approved by the Supreme Court.&#13;
62.   A Program Directorate was also established and made responsible for day-to-day&#13;
implementation of program activities under the guidance of the Council. It is headed by a&#13;
Director and includes two heads of program charged with responsibility for managing the&#13;
training and career components of the program. In addition, the Information Department&#13;
of the Court will report to the Program Directorate for purposes of the information system&#13;
components of the program.&#13;
63.   The Ministry of Justice has undertaken to hire a Project Coordinator who will be&#13;
responsible for implementation of the Ministry of Justice components of the program.&#13;
This coordinator would be expected to have extensive international experience in the&#13;
management of judicial reform programs, and would advise the Ministry and Judiciary on&#13;
project implementation. The Coordinator would be responsible for monitoring project&#13;
execution, including administrative aspects.&#13;
V. THE CREDIT&#13;
64.   Through support for the first phase of a comprehensive Judicial Reform Program,&#13;
the project aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of civil justice administration,&#13;
strengthen the capacity of the Judiciary to provide judicial services, and of the Ministry of&#13;
Justice to prepare, review and implement laws and programs related to the country's&#13;
constitutional, judicial, economic and social reforms. Institutional reforms under the&#13;
program would benefit the justice system as a whole, but specific interventions would&#13;
focus exclusively on civil justice.&#13;
65.   The project would support two main sets of activities. Those directly related to&#13;
the daily operations of the courts would be managed by the Judiciary and would include:&#13;
(i) judicial process reforms, designed to improve the quality and swiftness of civil dispute&#13;
resolution within the current legislative framework; (ii) human resource management&#13;
reforms, aimed at restructuring the incentives under which judges and clerical personnel&#13;
operate, in order to promote professional excellence and administrative efficiency; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
(iii) institutional strengthening programs, to develop the strategic management capacity of&#13;
the Judiciary. Parallel to these initiatives, activities not directly related to day-to-day court&#13;
functions would be managed by the Ministry of Justice and focus on: (i) implementation of&#13;
constitutional reforms, to establish the new institutions of the modem Bolivian judiciary;&#13;
(ii) alternative dispute resolution to improve access to dispute-resolution services,&#13;
particularly for marginalized social groups; (iii) legislative reforms designed to improve&#13;
the legal environment for private sector activity; and (iv) institutional strengthening, in&#13;
support of the Ministry.&#13;
A. JUDICIARY COMPONENTS&#13;
A. 1 JUDICIAL PROCESS REFORMS&#13;
66.   This component would constitute the driving element of the strategy aimed at&#13;
improving the delivery of civil justice administration services in Bolivia. It focuses entirely&#13;
on civil justice, and within the prevailing legislative framework seeks to introduce changes&#13;
in the handling of disputes through the issuance and implementation of new policies on&#13;
civil proceedings. The policy initiatives would be bolstered through training activities and&#13;
reform of courtroom administration.&#13;
67.   Judicial Process Policies. A key finding of the strategic planning exercises&#13;
undertaken to develop the reform program was the need for clear standards for managing&#13;
civil proceedings. The Supreme Court has agreed to define such policies to guide judges,&#13;
which will aim at ensuring an adequate balance between formal due process requirements&#13;
(giving the defendant adequate defense opportunities), substantive due process objectives&#13;
(providing both parties equal treatment in ensuring the effectiveness of their substantive&#13;
rights) and the timely resolution of disputes.&#13;
68.   In the field of formal due process requirements, the Court would issue guidelines&#13;
aimed at: (i) introducing conciliation in civil proceedings; (ii) direct and early participation&#13;
of judges in the management of the process; and (iii) other initiatives consistent with the&#13;
CCP's vision of assigning the judge a leading role in the conduct of judicial proceedings,&#13;
including restraining the parties' abuse of incidental matters for dilatory purposes.&#13;
69.   In the field of substantive due process, the Supreme Court would define policies&#13;
that clarify the degree of independence judges enjoy in adjudicating disputes, relative to&#13;
legislation, other branches of government and the judicial hierarchy. It would address the&#13;
methods of interpretation to be followed by judges in deciding disputes. The aim would&#13;
be to change the narrow view that judges seem to have of their roles - mainly as strict&#13;
interpreters of statutes - and to emphasize the social responsibility and autonomy that&#13;
judges should exercise in the resolution of disputes. In addition, specific regulations&#13;
would be issued on the production and weighing of evidence, interpretation of procedural&#13;
regulations, and the management of mandatory conciliation hearings.&#13;
70.   To ensure the timely resolution of disputes, the Supreme Court would establish&#13;
guidelines for the average duration of judicial procedures. Judges would be required to&#13;
manage their court workload to ensure that the average duration of cases in a court of first&#13;
instance would not exceed 200 days for ordinary procedures and 100 days for executive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
procedures. The guidelines have been set taking into account the legal deadlines&#13;
established in the CCP. In addition, caseload level and the complexity of cases will affect&#13;
the individual guidelines to be set for each judicial district. Although the proposed&#13;
guidelines would imply a substantial reduction from prevailing levels, participants in the&#13;
strategic planning exercises agreed they could be achieved. Compliance with the duration&#13;
guidelines will be one criterion in the performance evaluation system proposed under the&#13;
program. A manual information system designed to measure average case duration will be&#13;
implemented early in the program to ensure adequate monitoring of judges' compliance&#13;
with the guidelines.&#13;
71.   The implementation plan requires that these policies on judicial process reform be&#13;
set as a matter of priority in the initial phases of the program. The process of formulation&#13;
of these new policies will be highly participatory, involving key leaders of the judiciary and&#13;
local and foreign experts in the field. The final recommendations stemming from this&#13;
process would be submitted to the Supreme Court for consideration and approval. During&#13;
negotiations the Supreme Court agreed to issue the policy guidelines in the areas referred&#13;
to above, not later than December 31, 1995.&#13;
72.   Training Program for Judicial Process Reform   Critical to the success of the&#13;
new policies will be the implementation of an intensive training program, designed to&#13;
improve judges' ability to carry out the proposed procedural reforms. Four basic training&#13;
topics have been identified:&#13;
*  clarifying the role of the judge in terms of his/her social responsibilities and authority,&#13;
particularly in relation to the management of judicial proceedings;&#13;
*  development of specific skills to allow judges a more active role in managing cases, in&#13;
particular strengthening the judges' proficiency in due process issues, management of&#13;
conciliation and ensuring equal treatment of litigants;&#13;
* strengthening the skills of judges in managing the fact-finding stage of cases and in&#13;
assessing evidence; and&#13;
* strengthening judges' skills in planning, formulating and drafting judicial decisions.&#13;
73.   Training will initially be targeted at thirty judges selected on the basis of&#13;
professional ability and leadership in improving justice administration. This same group&#13;
would lead the activities on information systems and courtroom administration. Training&#13;
would be conducted through workshops that would allow ample trainee participation. An&#13;
in-depth evaluation of the initial training exercise would be carried out before expanding&#13;
training to all civil judges. For this second phase, it is envisaged that trainers could be&#13;
drawn from the initial group of civil judges.&#13;
74.   Judicial Information Systems. A two-stage approach is proposed for developing&#13;
courtroom information systems. The first stage will consist of developing a manual&#13;
information system. This would enable tribunals to integrate information that is currently&#13;
recorded in separate books, thus not generating useful data. This manual information&#13;
system will be designed to enable monitoring of court workloads and mandatory process&#13;
duration guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
75.   The second stage, to be implemented once an appropriate organizational design&#13;
has been established for civil courts, would involve development of a computerized court&#13;
information system to enable tribunals to monitor their operations. In the case of higher&#13;
level courts, the system would also enable the monitoring of key aspects of the tribunals&#13;
under their jurisdiction. This second phase would be implemented on a pilot basis in the&#13;
thirty lead courts of first instance. Information systems would also be established in some&#13;
District Courts and in the Supreme Court. It was agreed, however, that the level of&#13;
disaggregation of data received by the higher courts should be limited in order to&#13;
safeguard the independence of junior judges.&#13;
76.   Courtroom Administration. The first step under this component would be a study&#13;
that would include: (i) a diagnosis of the human resource inventory and prevailing&#13;
personnel policies at both the professional and support levels of the judiciary; (ii) a&#13;
diagnosis of the skills mix and job descriptions of incumbent judges and clerical personnel;&#13;
(iii) the development of alternative administrative structures to improve efficiency in&#13;
courtroom administration, together with proposed staffing requirements, job descriptions&#13;
and operational policies for the efficient operation of tribunals. The new structures would&#13;
take account of the proposed changes to judicial process management, particularly the&#13;
increased involvement of the judge in management of the process. The specific products&#13;
of this study will be organizational and personnel management manuals for court&#13;
administration. The second stage would involve implementation of the policies defined&#13;
under the study and would start with a pilot program in the thirty lead courts. The project&#13;
would finance the training requirements derived from the new organizational&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
A.2 HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT&#13;
77.   This component would seek to restructure the incentives influencing the&#13;
performance of judges and clerical personnel, in order to encourage increased&#13;
professionalism and independence. It consists of the development of a judicial career&#13;
system and training and ethics initiatives. Of these, the career and ethics systems would be&#13;
of general application within the Judiciary, while training programs financed by the project&#13;
will encompass only civil judges.&#13;
78.   Judicial Career System. The project will support the introduction of transparent&#13;
policies for recruitment, performance evaluation and promotion, as well as the&#13;
development of appropriate institutional arrangements for their implementation. The&#13;
Supreme Court, in a Letter of Understanding signed by the Presidents of the three&#13;
branches of government (see Annex 3) has already stated that it intends to: (i) guarantee&#13;
stability through the automatic renewal of judges with satisfactory performance as&#13;
determined by a transparent performance evaluation system; (ii) undertake recruitment of&#13;
judges through open and competitive procedures; and(iii) adopt transparent promotion&#13;
procedures based on objective criteria of professional competence, experience and&#13;
performance.&#13;
79.   A two-stage approach has been designed to phase in the judicial career system.&#13;
The first phase will entail the introduction of streamlined personnel management guidelines&#13;
in the areas of recruitment, performance evaluation and career advancement, aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
providing an immediate inventory of the qualifications and performance rating of&#13;
incumbents. These would be critical for decisions on renewals, recruitment and access to&#13;
training programs in the near term. The initial procedures would rely mostly on peer&#13;
reviews of judicial performance. As defined in the implementation targets it is expected&#13;
that the interim evaluation and recruitment guidelines would have been issued and their&#13;
implementation initiated by December 31, 1995.&#13;
80.   The second stage of the career system would be initiated upon the completion of&#13;
the proposed organizational and human resource study included under the Courtroom&#13;
Administration component. At that point, the Supreme Court would launch a&#13;
comprehensive study for the design of the components of the judicial career system and&#13;
define a strategy for its implementation. The study would be expected to produce:&#13;
*  a personnel selection system using competitive recruitment based on professional&#13;
merits, and a strategy for phasing out under-performing personnel;&#13;
*  a performance evaluation system focused on efficiency factors (i.e., caseload&#13;
discharge rates, adherence to process duration guidelines and decision reversal&#13;
rates) and quality factors (i.e., depth and caliber of decisions and effectiveness in&#13;
the management of proceedings);&#13;
*  a career advancement system based on specific job competencies for the various&#13;
judgeship positions and the results of performance evaluations; and&#13;
*  a review of prevailing compensation practices and definition of new policies to&#13;
reward professional excellence and administrative efficiency.&#13;
81.   The proposed project will also support the provision of technical assistance,&#13;
training and institution-building requirements (including the acquisition of equipment) to&#13;
implement the proposed personnel systems.&#13;
82.   Judicial Training Program. A priority activity will be the development of a&#13;
training program designed to support improvements in judicial process reform. In&#13;
addition, the training function within the judiciary will be more generally developed. To&#13;
this end, the reform program would include three initiatives:&#13;
* establishment of a training coordination unit within the Program Directorate;&#13;
* development of an on-the-job training program for newly appointed judges based&#13;
on tutorial services provided by prestigious retired judges; and&#13;
* development of a series of semi-annual seminars dealing with specific topics of&#13;
general interest for the judiciary.&#13;
83.   A participatory approach will be taken in the preparation of training materials and&#13;
instruction of trainers. The formulation of these materials will be the result of workshops,&#13;
with task groups composed of stakeholders (judges, lawyers, professors) and assisted by&#13;
external experts on methodology and specific legal or judicial issues.&#13;
84.   Judicial Ethics Program. The shortcomings of the incentive framework under&#13;
which judges operate, including the lack of mechanisms to ensure accountability, have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
resulted in a tendency towards corruption. The judicial reform program will introduce&#13;
significant measures aimed at redressing poor incentives in general. Because of the&#13;
magnitude of the problem, however, and the judiciary's particular interest in increasing its&#13;
responsiveness to the public, special attention will be given to mechanisms that promote&#13;
ethical conduct.&#13;
85.   The program includes an initiative to define the ethical standards applicable to&#13;
judges in the performance of their duties, and develop mechanisms for the enforcement of&#13;
these standards, including recourses available to the public. Some of these proposals may&#13;
require legislative approval before implementation. The program will include activities for&#13;
dissemination of the standards, procedures and recourses.&#13;
A. 3 INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF THE JUDICIARY&#13;
86.   The judicial reform program is expected to make a substantial contribution&#13;
towards development of the judiciary's strategic management capacity. The approach&#13;
proposed for the development of such capacity is a gradual build-up based on the demand&#13;
arising from the design and implementation of the activities included in the first phase of&#13;
the judicial reform program. The project would finance the strengthening and operation of&#13;
the Executive Council and the Program Directorate.&#13;
87.   Planning System and Legal Studies Office. As part of the institutional&#13;
strengthening efforts, the judiciary would establish a permanent planning system, which&#13;
will assume responsibility for preparation of the next phase of the reform, and an office of&#13;
legal studies to advise the Court on judicial policies. These two initiatives will start in the&#13;
medium term. The proposed project would finance technical assistance to define the&#13;
scope, staffing and operational characteristics of these offices.&#13;
A. 4 JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTFUND&#13;
88.   The various components of the reform program described above reflect a&#13;
deliberate effort by the judicial leadership to tackle the major shortcomings that have been&#13;
identified as affecting civil justice administration. As such, these components are the result&#13;
of a top-down planning process. Since the level of initiative and leadership can vary&#13;
greatly from one judicial district to the next, however, the program will include&#13;
establishment of a Judicial Development Fund aimed at promoting demand-driven&#13;
solutions to judicial administration issues and cultivating a healthy competitive&#13;
environment for innovation among judicial districts.&#13;
89.   The proposed credit would provide funds to be administered by the Executive&#13;
Council to finance subprojects sponsored by a judicial district. Proposals could cover a&#13;
complete judicial district, a set of civil courts or individual courts. To ensure balanced&#13;
allocation of resources, the operational manual of the Fund will provide that aggregate&#13;
project initiatives financed to any large (La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba) intermediate&#13;
(Tarija, Oruro, Chuquisaca) or small (Pando, Beni, Potosi) district shall not exceed 25%,&#13;
15% or 5% of the resources assigned to the Fund, respectively.&#13;
90.   Subprojects eligible for financing under the credit would consist of initiatives&#13;
which are complementary or incremental to the reform activities included in the program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
or which, although not included in the program, would provide a specific and monitorable&#13;
improvement in civil justice administration. Items eligible for financing would be specific&#13;
investments (goods or civil works) or technical assistance activities. The Fund would not&#13;
finance recurrent costs. Successful subprojects would be evaluated upon completion to&#13;
assess their replicability.&#13;
91.   The proposed project would finance technical assistance to develop an operational&#13;
manual for the identification, appraisal, approval and supervision of subprojects.&#13;
Consultants would be hired to help define eligibility criteria and financial and appraisal&#13;
policies to be adopted by the Executive Council, as well the institutional and staffing&#13;
arrangements for operation of the Fund. In addition, the credit would finance subprojects&#13;
up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$500,000. As a condition of disbursement of&#13;
the funds under this component, the Supreme Court would approve the Operational&#13;
Manual and set up the institutional arrangements for handling the proceeds of the credit&#13;
allocated for these purposes.&#13;
B. MINISTRY OF JUSTICE COMPONENTS&#13;
B.] IMPLEMENTATION OF COVSTITLTIONAL REFORMS ON JUDICIAL MATTERS&#13;
92.   In order to establish the institutional basis for a modern system of justice in Bolivia&#13;
as mandated by the Constitution, this component would include activities to ensure the&#13;
proper organization and functioning of the Judicial Council and Constitutional Tribunal.&#13;
The project would support the drafting of a law and regulations for both institutions, as&#13;
well as preparation of an administrative design and implementation plan. For the Judicial&#13;
Council, which will administer the budget and personnel systems of the judiciary, the&#13;
component will also support the provision of technical assistance, training and institution-&#13;
building requirements (including the acquisition of equipment) for these systems.&#13;
93.   In the case of the Constitutional Tribunal, a specialized court with exclusive&#13;
jurisdiction over cases involving constitutional challenges, the project will support a series&#13;
of seminars aimed at training the new justices as well as the general legal community in the&#13;
specialized proceedings of this court. The component will also help to establish a basic&#13;
reference library and to design a system of public information that would ensure that&#13;
decisions of the court are widely known and publicly available.&#13;
B. 2 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION&#13;
94.   Present legislation in this field deals only with arbitration and has some significant&#13;
shortcomings: it unduly limits the parties that can accede to arbitration and the type of&#13;
disputes that can be subjected to it; the rules on selecting arbitrators and the conduct of&#13;
proceedings are vague and fragmentary; it allows a high degree of intervention by the&#13;
courts at various stages of the process; and it does not provide for effective enforcement&#13;
of arbitral awards. A draft bill that would also authorize and regulate the utilization of&#13;
mediation and conciliation mechanisms and deal with all the shortcomings faced by the&#13;
present legislation is undergoing final revisions before its presentation to Congress.&#13;
95.   The project will support the Ministry's leadership role in the promotion and&#13;
implementation of legislation dealing with the strengthening of alternative dispute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
resolution mechanisms. This component would support the introduction of a system of&#13;
justices of the peace as a complementary initiative aimed at marginalized urban, rural and&#13;
indigenous communities. The initial step would consist of a study of modalities of dispute&#13;
resolution prevailing among these groups, drawing on traditional practices in order to&#13;
define the justices' functions accordingly.&#13;
96.   Drawing on the results of the study, the Ministry would then prepare a draft law&#13;
goveming the functions of justices of the peace. A one-year pilot program would be&#13;
designed and carried out in representative sample of communities throughout Bolivia. The&#13;
results of the pilot phase in different types of communities and regions would be evaluated&#13;
to assess the potential for expansion of the program. The project would also finance the&#13;
preparation of an expansion plan based on the outcome of the evaluation. Assurances&#13;
were obtained during negotiations, that the Ministry would submit not later than&#13;
June 30, 1996 for review and approval by the Association, the specific proposal for the&#13;
establishment and operation of the system of justices of the peace.&#13;
B. 3 LEGISLATIVE REFORMS&#13;
97.   The Ministry has defined as one of its priorities the promotion of legislative&#13;
reforms to improve both the rules governing private sector activity and the mechanisms&#13;
for their enforcement. In particular, the Ministry proposes reforms to two Codes - the&#13;
Commercial and Civil Procedures Codes - and the introduction of laws on alternative&#13;
dispute resolution mechanisms, secured transactions and administrative procedures.&#13;
98.   Amendments would be made to the existing Commercial Code in order to&#13;
introduce features of modem commercial practice absent from the present law. Reform of&#13;
the Civil Procedures Code would entail introduction of an entirely new code, thus this&#13;
initiative is regarded as the most complex of the planned legislative reforms. The process&#13;
would involve the establishment of a drafting commission consisting of several sub-groups&#13;
with some full-time and some part-time members, who would be expected to produce a&#13;
draft code by the end of the project's second year. The component would finance short-&#13;
term technical assistance needs derived from these initiatives.&#13;
B. 4 INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF THEMINISTRY OF JUSTICE&#13;
99.   The Ministry of Justice is a new institution, created in September 1993 and&#13;
charged with responsibility for modernizing Bolivia's laws, and coordinating relations with&#13;
the Judiciary, amongst other tasks. The assistance to the Ministry under this component&#13;
would focus on strengthening its capacity to improve the quality of primary and secondary&#13;
legislation in Bolivia. It would permit the Ministry to provide a quality-control function,&#13;
based on the provision of research and advisory services to those responsible for&#13;
preparation of rules.&#13;
100.  The component would help to establish a Technical Office in the Ministry that&#13;
would provide services to the rest of the Executive, and eventually to any member of the&#13;
public, to assist with the formulation of legislative proposals. The proposed credit would&#13;
finance a long-term advisor for the Office, who would also be responsible for preparation&#13;
of a manual, to be distributed throughout the government, setting out basic guidelines for&#13;
the formulation of draft laws and regulations. The office would be outfitted with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
equipment linking it to comparative law sources, and would have an information system to&#13;
allow analysis of legislation aimed at eliminating inconsistencies that give rise to&#13;
uncertainty and litigation. Also included would be establishment of a law library and a&#13;
series of training seminars for government lawyers.&#13;
101.  It is a medium-term objective of the Ministry to develop an information system&#13;
that would provide on-line access to the laws of Bolivia. Since development and&#13;
maintenance of such a system would be costly, the Ministry will undertake a study of&#13;
alternatives for its establishment and operation, including the possibility of private&#13;
provision of the service. This study would be financed by the credit.&#13;
C PROJECT COORDINATION UNIT&#13;
102.  Experience ofjudicial reform activities is very limited in Bolivia. The Ministry of&#13;
Justice and Executive Council of the Supreme Court have therefore identified a need for a&#13;
project office that would be headed by a Coordinator with international experience of&#13;
judicial reform programs. This office would have direct responsibility for implementation&#13;
of the Ministry of Justice components, and would monitor and support the reform process&#13;
in general, including through the provision of advice on the Judiciary components of the&#13;
project. It would play a central role in the project implementation reviews to be carried&#13;
out on an annual basis.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS AND FiNANCING PLAN&#13;
103.  The total project cost is estimated at US$12.75 million equivalent, including about&#13;
US$4.0 million in local costs. The proposed credit in an amount of SDR 7.6 million&#13;
(US$11.0 million equivalent) would finance 86% percent of the total project cost. The&#13;
balance would be financed by the Judiciary and Ministry of Justice through budgetary&#13;
appropriations.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATIONARRANGEMENTS&#13;
104.  The proposed project would have two executing entities: the Judiciary, responsible&#13;
for execution of the judiciary subproject, and the Ministry of Justice, responsible for&#13;
execution of the Ministry of Justice subproject. The Supreme Court has already&#13;
established the Executive Council and Program Directorate as the main bodies within the&#13;
judiciary in charge of program activities. In addition, the Judicial Council, once it is&#13;
deemed operational to IDA's satisfaction, will assume primary responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
implementation of relevant components. The Ministry of Justice will rely on the Project&#13;
Coordinator for implementation of its component.&#13;
105.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Supreme Court would&#13;
maintain both the Council and Program Directorate with an organizational structure,&#13;
powers and functions acceptable to IDA, and continue to assign to those entities personnel&#13;
with qualifications and experience also acceptable to IDA, while the Ministry of Justice&#13;
would hire and maintain a Project Coordinator with qualifications and functions acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
106.  Implementation will be paced to match a gradual build-up of institutional capacity.&#13;
Interventions related to reform of civil procedures would be implemented initially on a&#13;
pilot basis and would be extended to other civil courts gradually as experience is gained in&#13;
managing the reform program. As a result of the project, it is expected that civil process&#13;
reforms would have been introduced in about 50% of the civil first instance courts, 40%&#13;
of the District Courts and the Supreme Court. Interventions aimed at the introduction of&#13;
adequate career incentives (i.e. judicial career, judicial ethics and permanent judicial&#13;
training activities) and institutional strengthening (i.e. planning system and Legal Studies&#13;
Office) would be introduced on a system-wide basis. Institutional measures included&#13;
under the constitutional reform component are priorities for early action.&#13;
107.  Key outputs of the proposed implementation plan have been singled out as&#13;
progress indicators to be evaluated during the annual project reviews proposed under the&#13;
credit (see Annex 5). The major features of the proposed implementation plan are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
* The first phase of the judicial reform program to be supported under the project&#13;
would last approximately three-and-a-half years.&#13;
*  Institutional reforms designed to establish the new entities of the judicial branch&#13;
would be tackled during the first year of the program.&#13;
*  Other central activities during the first year will consist of process reforms in civil&#13;
justice administration. This includes formulation of policies on civil process&#13;
reforms by the Supreme Court, development of training materials based on these&#13;
policies and implementation of reform initiatives on a pilot basis in thirty leading&#13;
courts.&#13;
*  These activities would be complemented by initial changes in the performance&#13;
incentives for judges through the introduction of streamlined personnel&#13;
management guidelines on performance evaluation, career advancement and&#13;
recruitment, the development and implementation of a manual information system&#13;
and an organization and human resource inventory study.&#13;
*  The second year of the program would focus on development of other institutional&#13;
strengthening initiatives, such as the judicial ethics program, training for new&#13;
judges, introduction of the comprehensive career system, and initial&#13;
implementation of the computerized information system. In addition, judicial&#13;
process reforms would be extended to another fifty civil courts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
* The third year of the program would extend coverage of the judicial process&#13;
reforms to an additional group of fifty courts and consolidate the initiatives in the&#13;
areas of training, judicial ethics, automated information systems and judicial career&#13;
108.  The use of specialized software applications for monitoring program&#13;
implementation will facilitate dialogue between the executing agencies and the Bank&#13;
Group. Annex 4 contains the detailed implementation plan for the program. This annex is&#13;
a working document and would be modified from time to time to reflect progress and, if&#13;
needed, adjustments in the project's implementation modalities and schedule. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were provided that the Supreme Court and Ministry of Justice&#13;
would (i) carry out the project in accordance with the respective performance indicators&#13;
set forth in Annex 5; (ii) carry out reviews on progress in the implementation of the&#13;
program on an annual basis; and (iii) make in a timely manner the adjustments that may be&#13;
required from time to time to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the project.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS&#13;
109.  The proposed operation aims to improve the enforceability of legal and contractual&#13;
rights through improved judicial administration and increased access to alternative dispute&#13;
resolution mechanisms. As such, the project is not expected to adversely affect the&#13;
environment. In the medium term, the project could have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment as it reinforces, the effectiveness of legal regulation over social and economic&#13;
activities. An effective legal framework is a key instrument for deterring environmentally&#13;
damaging activities or seeking remedies.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
110.  Consultants financed under the credit would be employed in accordance with&#13;
procedures and criteria set forth in the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published by the Bank in&#13;
August 1981, and with terms of reference and conditions of employment satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. All consultant contracts will be subject to prior review.&#13;
111.  Contracts for computer and office equipment will be grouped to the extent&#13;
possible in packages estimated to cost at least US$150,000. Contracts estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$150,000 would be procured in accordance with ICB procedures. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost US$150,000 or less could be procured in accordance with Limited&#13;
International Bidding (LIB) procedures, providing manufacturers and suppliers with&#13;
established maintenance services in Bolivia an opportunity to bid for these contracts.&#13;
Contracts estimated to cost US$25,000 or less, up to an agreggate amount of $500,000,&#13;
could be procured through shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank, requiring at least&#13;
three quotations from eligible suppliers. IDA would require prior review of contracts for&#13;
all LIB and ICB procurement. Small works and rehabilitation contracts under the Judicial&#13;
Development Fund (each estimated to cost less than US$50,000) will be procured through&#13;
shopping procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;

112.  In view of the limited experience in managing procurement, the Supreme Court&#13;
will engage a procurement specialist to assist it in implementing procurement, preparing&#13;
procurement manuals and strengthening the capacity of the Program Directorate as the&#13;
entity that will be directly responsible for managing procurement activities. It is estimated&#13;
that IDA will review about 85% of the estimated expenditures on goods and equipment&#13;
envisaged under the project. The table above summarizes the procurement arrangements&#13;
for the project.&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
113.  To facilitate project execution, separate dollar Special Accounts would be&#13;
established for the Ministry of Justice and the Judiciary in the Central Bank of Bolivia.&#13;
IDA would make initial deposits of US$150,000 and US$300,000 respectively to these&#13;
accounts, to be increased to a maximum of US$300,000 and US$600,000 when&#13;
disbursements to the accounts have reached US$450,000 and US$900,000 respectively.&#13;
The minimum size of disbursement applications will be US$60,000 and US$120,000 for&#13;
the Ministry of Justice and Judiciary respectively, when the full amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation is disbursed.&#13;
114.  The credit would finance 100% of consultant services, training and related&#13;
expenses, 100% of foreign costs and local ex-factory costs for equipment purchases and&#13;
85% of other local equipment purchases. Disbursements to the Judicial Development&#13;
Fund will finance 100% of the cost of subprojects. Contracts for equipment valued at less&#13;
than US$25,000 and contracts for works would be disbursed against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). Detailed supporting documentation for expenditures would be&#13;
retained by the Program Directorate or the Ministry of Justice, as the case may be, and&#13;
would be made available for the required audits and for the review of Bank supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
missions. The proposed credit is expected to take three-and-a-half years to disburse. The&#13;
Closing Date would be September 30, 1999. Disbursement arrangements are described in&#13;
the tables below.&#13;

MONITORING AND REPORTING&#13;
115.  Based on inputs from the Executive Council of the Supreme Court and from the&#13;
Ministry of the Justice, the Project Coordinator would provide to IDA semi-annual reports&#13;
on progress in implementation. Such reports shall include the level of commitments and&#13;
disbursements under the credit. In addition, the Ministry of Justice, Executive Council&#13;
and IDA will carry out Annual Reviews to assess progress in the implementation of the&#13;
project. This review would specifically assess progress towards meeting the&#13;
implementation targets set forth in Annex 5, the impact on the judiciary's performance of&#13;
the initiatives supported by the project and the adjustments that may be required in order&#13;
to achieve the desired impact in justice administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
AUDiTING&#13;
116.  The Program Directorate and the Ministry of Justice would maintain separate&#13;
accounts to record and monitor expenditures under the respective project components&#13;
financed under the credit. These accounts would be audited in accordance with generally&#13;
accepted accounting principles by a single firm of independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Association and would be submitted to IEDA not later than four months after the end of&#13;
each fiscal year. In the case of expenditures submitted for Association financing through&#13;
SOEs, the auditors' opinion would explicitly cover the existence and acceptability of the&#13;
supporting documentation for the SOEs.&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvious BANK INVOL VEMENT&#13;
117. The Bank Group's experience in the justice sector is limited. A previous operation&#13;
approved for Venezuela (Judicial Infrastructure Project) emphasized the infrastructure&#13;
aspects ofjustice administration. Based on institutional reform experiences in other&#13;
sectors, the proposed project has attempted to strike a balance between the policy,&#13;
organizational and infrastructure aspects of justice administration. A strong&#13;
complementary relationship has been developed among the various components, with&#13;
judicial policy reforms supported by changes in personnel incentives and improved&#13;
information and courtroom administration.&#13;
118.  Bank experience in Bolivia, as reflected in recent project Completion Reports and&#13;
a project Performance Audit Report, has identified the need for: (i) developing clear&#13;
understanding on policy objectives; (ii) building up ownership and project implementation&#13;
capacity; and (iii) periodic evaluations to permit adjustments in design and implementation&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
119.  In the design of the proposed operation, these lessons have been .aken into&#13;
account. The development of a direct and frank dialogue with the Ministry of Justice,&#13;
Supreme Court and leaders within the judiciary has contributed to strong ownership of the&#13;
reform strategy. Institutional arrangements to ensure project implementation capacity&#13;
have been introduced up front during project preparation. Finally, annual implementation&#13;
reviews will be carried out to permit any necessary adjustments to the project design and&#13;
implementation plan.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
120.  The proposed operation would support the first step in a process of reform that&#13;
would generate substantive benefits in the medium term by helping to establish an&#13;
institutional framework that ensures private agents' consistency and predictability in the&#13;
enforcement of their rights. The reforms would remove the serious distortions in Bolivia's&#13;
business environment that inhibit private investment and an efficient allocation of&#13;
resources. By levelling the playing field for investors, regardless of size or status, the&#13;
project would encourage private-sector-led development in a way that both raises growth&#13;
and improves equity. It would help to alleviate the economic and social costs imposed on&#13;
low-income groups by the prevailing justice system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
RISKS&#13;
121.  The design of the operation is complicated by the need for coordination between&#13;
two branches of government. During preparation, this issue was addressed by engaging in&#13;
joint policy dialogue with the Executive and Judiciary. For implementation of the&#13;
proposed project, permanent channels of communication have been established between&#13;
the two branches. Most important, in the design of the project, care has been taken to&#13;
define clearly the tasks of each, so that the lines of responsibility are distinctly drawn.&#13;
122.  Other main risks are related to the institutional capacity of the judiciary, which has&#13;
limited experience in dealing with the challenges involved in implementing a&#13;
comprehensive reform initiative. The proposed project is dealing with these risks by using&#13;
a highly participatory approach to ensure commitment to the reform program, and by early&#13;
identification of the institutional needs derived from the program. It has required up-front&#13;
establishment of the main institutional and policy elements that would enable its successful&#13;
implementation and is directly supporting further institutional strengthening initiatives.&#13;
The judiciary's willingness to move decisively in the field of institutional strengthening&#13;
provides a clear indication of the priority assigned to the reform program.&#13;
VI. AGREED ACTIONS&#13;
123.  The following agreements regarding the terms and conditions of project&#13;
implementation were reached during negotiations:&#13;
(a) the Supreme Court would issue not later than December 31, 1995 the Judicial&#13;
Procedures Guidelines on the following subjects: conciliation, oral procedures,&#13;
direct and active involvement of judges in the handling of the judicial process,&#13;
and the expected average duration of judicial procedures;&#13;
(b) the Ministry of Justice would submit not later than June 30, 1996, for review&#13;
by the Association, the specific proposal for the establishment and operation of&#13;
a system of Justices of the Peace;&#13;
(c) the Judiciary and Ministry of Justice would carry out their respective&#13;
components in accordance with the implementation targets set forth in Annex&#13;
5;&#13;
(a) the Judiciary and Ministry of Justice would carry out annual project&#13;
implementation reviews to assess progress in the implementation of the project&#13;
and in achieving the implementation targets set forth in Annex 5.&#13;
124.  As a condition of disbursements for subprojects under the Judicial Development&#13;
Fund, the Supreme Court would approve the Operational Manual for the processing,&#13;
approval and supervision of these subprojects and would set up the institutional&#13;
arrangements for handling the funds. Disbursements for activities related to the operation&#13;
of the Judicial Council and Constitutional Tribunal would be conditioned in each case on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;

STRUCTURE OF THE BOLIVIAN JUDICIARY&#13;
1.    The Supreme Court is the maximum judicial authority of Bolivia. It is&#13;
composed of twelve justices appointed to their positions for ten-year periods. Based on&#13;
the procedures defined in the 1993 Law of Judicial Organization, recently named&#13;
justices have been appointed by a simple majority of the Chamber of Deputies, from&#13;
lists approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. In future, justices will be&#13;
appointed by a two-thirds majority of the full Congress from lists prepared by the new&#13;
Judicial Council. Court positions are informally allocated to ensure proportionate&#13;
representation of the country's departments. The Supreme Court has ultimate&#13;
jurisdiction on disputes regarding civil, commercial and criminal matters. It has been&#13;
granted exclusive powers to rule on adminstrative disputes between the state and&#13;
private parties. Until August 1994, when the Constitution was reformed, the Supreme&#13;
Court also ruled on cases involving interpretation of constitutional rights and powers.&#13;
2.    The recent reforms to the Constitution narrowed the Supreme Court's range of&#13;
powers through the establishment of two new institutions in the Judiciary: a specialized&#13;
Constitutional Tribunal and a Judicial Council responsible for the sector's&#13;
administration. The Supreme Court has retained its power to represent the Judicial&#13;
Branch and thus effectively remains at the head of the sector. Although the new&#13;
Constitution is already in effect, the Court continues to function as before, until the&#13;
new institutions begin operations.&#13;
3.    The Constitutional Tribunal will consist of five justices appointed under the&#13;
same procedures and conditions as Supreme Court Justices. The Tribunal is&#13;
independent, subject only to the Constitution. It enjoys exclusive jurisdiction over&#13;
cases involving constitutional rights and powers, including challenges to the&#13;
constitutionality of laws, executive decrees and other governmental acts. Traditional&#13;
constitutional appeals, such as that of habeas corpus, are also heard by the Tribunal. It&#13;
also responds to queries from the Presidents of the three branches of government&#13;
regarding the constitutionality of draft legislation or of legislation applied to a specific&#13;
case. The Constitutional Tribunal has not yet begun to operate; the Congress must&#13;
appoint its first five justices and pass a law defining in detail the Tribunal's powers and&#13;
functions for it to begin to operate.&#13;
4.    The Judicial Council is in a similar situation. Although legally established, it&#13;
will not start to function until a law is approved setting out in detail its responsibilities.&#13;
The Judicial Council is headed the President of the Supreme Court and includes four&#13;
councillors chosen by the Congress under the same procedures and conditions as&#13;
Supreme Court justices. The Council is the administrative and disciplinary body of the&#13;
Judicial Branch. It prepares the lists from which all judicial personnel are chosen,&#13;
including Supreme Court justices, Superior Court judges, circuit court judges, notaries&#13;
and registrars. It is responsible for administering the judicial career system and for&#13;
preparing and executing the judicial budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

5.    Below the Supreme Court are the nine Superior District Courts which exercise&#13;
jurisdiction over a departments. Superior Court judges are appointed by the Supreme&#13;
Court for renewable six-year periods. Membership ranges from three judges in the&#13;
smallest department (Pando) to twelve judges in the largest (La Paz). For judicial&#13;
purposes, the Superior Courts operate as collegiate bodies (salas), which in the larger&#13;
departments specialize in either civil or criminal law. District Courts exercise&#13;
considerable management control within their departments. Although subject to&#13;
oversight from the Supreme Court, they administer their operations in a fairly&#13;
decentralized way.&#13;
6.    Cases begin either in a circuit court or a junior circuit court, depending on the&#13;
value of the claim (in civil cases) or the gravity of the offense (in criminal cases).&#13;
Circuit judges are appointed by the Supreme Court whilst junior circuit judges are&#13;
named by the Superior Courts, both for renewable four-year terms. Courts in urban&#13;
areas tend to specialize in civil, criminal or family law. Rural courts exercise&#13;
jurisdiction on all matters. Decisions of junior circuit courts are subject to review by&#13;
circuit courts, whose decisions are reviewed in turn by the Superior Court concerned.&#13;
7-.    The lowest-level courts are small claims courts. Small claims judges are not&#13;
personnel of the Judiciary. They are appointed by Superior Courts and usually operate&#13;
both as small claims judges and notaries. They receive no funding from the Judicial&#13;
Branch, and are expected to fund themselves from fees they are authorized to levy.&#13;
Their jurisdiction is limited to cases involving minimal sums, defined in bolivianos.&#13;
Inflation has overtaken the sum presently defining their jurisdiction, so that their&#13;
importance is severely limited. Scant information exists on the number of small claims&#13;
courts in operation.&#13;

econ6micos para el cumplimiento de las metas que se definan. Las&#13;
partes signatarias acuerdan iniciar en el corto plazo los estudios&#13;

sector judicial y las prioridades para su desarrollo, entre estos,&#13;
mejoras salariales consistentes, implantaci6n de un sistema de&#13;
carrera judicial, mejoras en infraestructura y equipamiento de los&#13;
tribunales y necesidades de capacitaci6n. Los recursos para el&#13;
financiamiento de la estrategia provendrdn directamente del&#13;

mecanismos id6neos para sancionar la retardacion de justicia.&#13;

contendrd una clasificaci6n y calificaciun de los funcionarios&#13;
judiciales basada en criterios de idoneidad profesional y&#13;
eficiencia funcionaria.&#13;

BOLIVIA&#13;
El lnstituto serd el Centro academico para la profesionalizaci6n de&#13;
nuevos jueces por especialidades y capacitaci6n de los que se&#13;
encuentren en ejercicio para poner en vigor la Carrera Judicial&#13;
apolitica, y, en general, fortalecer en forma sostenida la&#13;
capacidad tecnico-profesional de los miembros de la Judicatura.&#13;
8.   Las politicas a ser implementadas a fin de desarrollar la carrera&#13;
judicial serdn las siguientes:&#13;
*    el establecimiento de un sistema que consista en: (i)&#13;
garantizar la estabilidad en sus cargos de los funcionarios&#13;
que tengan un desempefho satisfactorio; y (ii) permitir la&#13;
promoci6rn dentro de los diversos niveles de la judicatura&#13;
a los magistrados que cumplan con los requerimientos de&#13;
idoneidad profesional y experiencia funcionaria que se&#13;
establezcan para cada caso.&#13;
*    la creaci6n de un Consejo Supremo de la Magistratura&#13;
Judicial como 6rgano mdximo de gobierno del Poder&#13;
Judicial, facultado para nombrar a todos los funcionarios&#13;
con jurisdicci6n (magistrados, vocales y jueces); defender&#13;
la independencia judicial, mantener tuici6n sobre el&#13;
Instituto de Profesionalizaci6n de jueces para garantizar la&#13;
estabilidad de los magistrados en sus cargos y, por tanto,&#13;
la independencia en el ejercicio de sus funciones. Ademas&#13;
de  otras  facultades  de  caracter  jurisdiccional,&#13;
administrativo y econ6mico-financiero;&#13;
*    el establecimiento de mecanismos transparentes y publicos&#13;
para la selecci6n de nuevos magistrados a la carrera&#13;
judicial;&#13;
*    el establecmiento de normas sobre promoci6n que otorguen&#13;
prioridad a los funcionarios de carrera basadas en&#13;
criterios de idoneidad profesional y funcionaria.&#13;

9.   Serd un objetivo inmediato desarrollar los medios efectivos para&#13;
la implementaci6n de estas politicas, incluyendo programas de&#13;
entrenamiento de los jueces y el diseno de recursos efectivos que&#13;
permitan corregir en forma expedita dilaciones, debiendo&#13;
implementarse para erradicarla el programa de informdtica&#13;
juridica nacional.&#13;
10   No obstante lo anterior, serd actividad privativa de la Corte&#13;
Suprema en uso de sus facultades constitucionales indelegables&#13;
formular y aplicar nuevas politicas de administraci6n de justicia&#13;
que persigan los siguientes objetivos:&#13;
*    asegurar un rol mas dinadmco del juez en el manejo del&#13;
proceso civil destinado a obtener una resoluci6n expedita&#13;
de los conflictos que se sometan a su consideraci6n sin&#13;
perjuicio de dar la protecci6n debida - los derechos&#13;
legitimos de la parte afectada.&#13;
11   Los mecanismos que se analizarian a fin de promover este nuevo&#13;
rol comprenden: (i) la utilizaci6n de procedimientos orales que&#13;
permita,, al juez conocer los tdrminos y circunstancias de &gt;'&#13;
contraversia directamente de las partes; (ii) sujeto a lai&#13;
complejidad y cuantia de la materia en disputa, las audiencias&#13;
orales podrian permitir concentrar el andlisis, ---ueba y decisi6n&#13;
judicial en una sola audiencia; (iii) la busqueda activa de la&#13;
conciliacion entre las partes; (iv) el establecimiento de criterios&#13;
que permitan el rechazo de los incidentes de defensas que&#13;
arguyan las partes con animo dilatorio&#13;
o de mala fe; y (v) la utilizaci6n de audiencias orales part al&#13;
conocimiento de las causas en los tribunales colegiados. Tales&#13;
prop6sitos s6lo seran posibles con la modificaci6n de los C6digos&#13;
procesales en una activa labor de transformaci6n que compromete&#13;
una permanente labor legislativa, compatible con los principios&#13;
sustentados de la Constituci6n.&#13;
*    desarrollar medios de caracter judicial o administrativo que&#13;
otorguen protecci6n efectiva y expedita contra abusos en&#13;
las decisiones judiciales.&#13;

12.  Los medios a ser consideradios comprenden: (i) el desarrollo de&#13;
sistemas de informaci6n eficientes que permitan conocer a nivel&#13;
de cada tribunal la eficiencia administrativa en el manejo de los&#13;
procesos; y (ii) el desarrollo o perfeccionamiento de recursos&#13;
procesales que permitan corregir en forma expedita las decisiones&#13;
judiciales que generen retardaci6n indebida o abuso manifiesto en&#13;
la interpretaci6n de la legislaci6n, en cuyo caso se buscard&#13;
dinanmizar la difuci6n de la jurisdisprudencia de la Corte Suprema&#13;
para uniformar criterios de magistrados y jueces en la&#13;
interpretaci6n de la ley.&#13;
*    desarrollar metodos modernos para el procesamiento y&#13;
documentaci6n de la informaci6n relativa al proceso. Dichos&#13;
metodos deberan garantizar la integridad y fidelidad de la&#13;
informaci6n y reducir los costos de producci6n,&#13;
reproducci6n y conservaci6n que plantea el actual sistema&#13;
de expediertes.&#13;
:    desarrollar normas y m6todos de notificaci6n de los actos&#13;
procesales y comunicaci6n del tribunal con agentes&#13;
externos (oficios, exhortos, etc.) mas expeditos y menos&#13;
vulnerables al abuso dilatorio.&#13;
13   La implementacion de este componente se llevara a cabo en dos&#13;
etapas. La primelt± etapa comprende poner en vigencia aquellas&#13;
politicas que son consistentes con el marco legislativo y&#13;
administrativo vigente e iniciar el andlisis de las reformas&#13;
requeridas para la implantaci6n de la totalidad del programa. La&#13;
segunda etapa se emprenderd una vez se hubieran completado los&#13;
cambios legislativos o administrativos identificados en la etapa&#13;
preliminar.&#13;
14   Los Poderes Ejecutivo y Legislativo en estricto cumplimiento del&#13;
articulo 119 de la Constituci6n Politica del Estado haran cuanto&#13;
este a su alcance para asegurar efectivamente la autonomia&#13;
econ6mica del Poder Judicial en el marco de la ley, la&#13;
independencia y coordinaci6n de los tres Poderes del Estado a&#13;
que se refiere el articulo 2o. de la carta fundamental dela&#13;
Naci6n. .&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall goal of the Judicial Reform
            Project is to create a judicial system that contributes to
            economic growth by facilitating private sector activity, and
            to social welfare by guaranteeing the basic rights of all
            citizens. The project will support two main sets of
            activities. Those directly related to the daily operations
            of the courts will be managed by the Judiciary and will
            include: 1) judicial process reforms, designed to improve
            the quality an swiftness of civil dispute resolution within
            the current legislative framework; 2) human resource
            management reforms, aimed at restructuring the incentives
            under which judges and clerical personnel operate in order
            to promote professional excellence and administrative
            efficiency; and 3) institutional strengthening programs.
            Activities not directly related to day-to-day court
            functions will be managed by the Ministry of Justice and
            focus on: 1) implementation of constitutional reforms, to
            establish the new institutions of the modern Bolivian
            judiciary; 2) alternative dispute resolution to improve
            access to dispute-resolution services; 3) legislative
            reforms designed to improve the legal environment for
            private sector activity, and 4) institutional strengthening,
            in support of the Ministry.
