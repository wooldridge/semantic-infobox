                Labor Redundancies and Privatization&#13;
                What should governments do?&#13;
&#13;
Sunita Kikeri   When state-owned enterprises preparing for privatization have very high levels of redundant&#13;
&#13;
                workers and when social safety nets and redundancy provisions in labor laws are inadequate or&#13;
&#13;
                lacking, the political and social implications of layoffs mean that the government should be&#13;
&#13;
                involved in the design and funding of special programs to deal with unemployment and labor&#13;
&#13;
                unrest. This Note reviews the main elements of such programs--severance and retirement&#13;
&#13;
                benefits, retraining and redeployment support, employee share ownership schemes, and,&#13;
&#13;
                importantly, mechanisms to ensure labor consultation and participation. (Many of these&#13;
&#13;
                components are supported in World Bank operations--see box 1.) In many countries these&#13;
&#13;
                programs need to go hand-in-hand with reforms to expand private labor markets: removing&#13;
&#13;
                obstacles to job creation, ending restrictions on hiring and firing, and eliminating taxes that raise&#13;
&#13;
                the cost of labor.&#13;

            Labor redundancies and privatization
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            When state-owned enterprises preparing
            for privatization have very high levels of redundant workers
            and when social safety nets and redundancy provisions in
            labor laws are inadequate or lacking, the political and
            social implications of layoffs mean that the government
            should be involved in the design and funding of special
            programs to deal with unemployment and labor unrest. This
            note reviews the main elements of such programs severance
            and retirement benefits, retraining and redeployment
            support, employee share ownership schemes, and importantly,
            mechanisms to ensure labor consultation and participation.
            In many countries these programs need to go hand-in-hand
            with reforms to expand private labor markets: removing
            obstacles to job creation, ending restrictions on hiring and
            firing, and eliminating taxes that raise the cost of labor.
