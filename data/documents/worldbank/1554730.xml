ABSTRACT&#13;
Increasing poverty and landlessness in Bangladesh are compelling&#13;
socio-economic change. Traditional social organization has confined women&#13;
to the household sphere. Despite this constraint, women have made a&#13;
substantial contribution to agricultural production, mainly through&#13;
post-harvest and food processing activities within their households. This&#13;
contribution is undervalued, if at all counted, because it is considered&#13;
domestic labor. Modernization and the introduction of technology is&#13;
displacing many of these opportunities, especially in rice processing.&#13;
Many rural women need to work outside their households in order to survive,&#13;
but the rural wage economy is not prepared for them.&#13;
Part I provides background on the social, cultural, and economic&#13;
issues relevant to the concern for increasing women's opportunities for&#13;
employment and income generation in rural Bangladesh. It describes the&#13;
full range of women's economic contribution and importance to the rural&#13;
economy and to the consumption and welfare of their families. Some of the&#13;
Government and nongovernmental programs to improve the status and skills of&#13;
women in Bangladesh are described, and approaches are suggested for&#13;
increasing income-earning opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Part II discusses the capital and labor intensiveness of various&#13;
crop-processing technologies and their impact on the employment of women.&#13;
After direct crop production, post-harvest activities are the most&#13;
significant source of rural employment for women, especially among landless&#13;
and marginal families, those most affected by the loss of opportunity due&#13;
to technological changes. The paper examines the extent, causes, and&#13;
effects of technological changes in food processing (especially rice, oil&#13;
seeds, and sugar) and small-scale and cottage industries (jute and silk).&#13;
It suggests measures and an institutional framework to identify, develop,&#13;
and disseminate appropriate technologies that would create employment&#13;
opportunities, especially for women. Conclusions and recommendations are&#13;
in Part III.&#13;

SUMKARY&#13;
Socio-economic Context&#13;
The social and economic position of the nearly 39 million women&#13;
(about 92% of the total female population) in the rural society of&#13;
Bangladesh is weak. They bear a considerable work load, often working&#13;
extremely long hours (17 per day), that involves productive activities, as&#13;
well as household maintenance and reproduction. Since many of these&#13;
activities are complementary to those of men, integrated within the family&#13;
and homestead-based production unit, and performed in seclusion&#13;
(in observance of purdah), they are not recognized as economic activities.&#13;
Yet, female labor is critical to post-harvest food processing and has a&#13;
great impact on total production in the agriculture sector. It is&#13;
estimated that female labor accounts for at least 25 percent of value added&#13;
in the production of rice, Bangladesh's staple grain. Women are equally&#13;
significant in the post-harvest processing of jute, the second most&#13;
important crop. Within the homestead, women also cultivate vegetables,&#13;
spices, and oil seeds to supply additional nutrients to their families'&#13;
predominantly rice diet.&#13;
Among the landless or nearly landless, who comprise 52 percent of&#13;
the country's population and 48 percent of its households, an increasing&#13;
number of rural women require wage labor outside the confines of the&#13;
homestead. Households headed by women are particularly disadvantaged, and&#13;
the absence of working males in a household is a factor in its&#13;
impoverishment. Even so, there are significant constraints to women's&#13;
access to better nutrition, health services, and nonformal and formal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
education that would enhance their opportunities for wage labor. (The&#13;
level of female literacy, for example, is only 14 percent, and maternal&#13;
mortality accounts for 27 percent of deaths among women 10-49 years old.)&#13;
Some women are able to earn income by making handicrafts, raising&#13;
livestock, buying and processing paddy for sale as rice, and selling&#13;
surplus vegetables at their households. The more common alternative is for&#13;
women to seek work in the househo§ds of others, processing rice or doing&#13;
household chores and menial tasks. Women also participate in the&#13;
Government's various labor-intensive rural works programs. But, many&#13;
women, however great their need, are unable to find work that provides for&#13;
their families' subsistence, and, for all types of income-generating work,&#13;
women find fewer work opportunities than men. Women earn more from field&#13;
work than other types of wage work, but in terms of earnings and number of&#13;
days worked, the best employment opportunities for women are in rice&#13;
processing. Due to uncertainties and irregularity about terms and method&#13;
of payment, it is difficult to compare male and female wage rates, although&#13;
calculations indicate that the highest female wages are lower than the&#13;
lowest male wages. However, when prices are rising rapidly, the real value&#13;
of payment to women, who generally receive payment in kind plus meals, also&#13;
increases.&#13;
Government and NGO Programs&#13;
In Bangladesh, as women's earnings become increasing more&#13;
important for the survival of impoverished families, special&#13;
income-generating programs for women are necessary. Female employment&#13;
should not be considered separately from an overall employment strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
wherein women contribute to purchasing power and welfare of individual&#13;
families. The Government, in recognition of this need, has initiated&#13;
policies and programs for women, mainly from a welfare perspective. Its&#13;
Second Five-Year Plan (1980-85) calls for programs aimed at the&#13;
socio-economic emancipation and skill development of women (para. 8.46).&#13;
The Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs is viewed as a catalytic&#13;
agency in this process.&#13;
Also, women's programs are run by a number of voluntary&#13;
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which operate independently of each&#13;
other and vary widely in their objectives. NGO experiences suggest that&#13;
realistic approaches to expand the prospects for income-generating&#13;
activities among rural women take into account the cultural constraints&#13;
imposed on women, the capacities of illiterate women, and the limited&#13;
market for their products and services. Successful NGO income-generating&#13;
programs have focused on women of the same economic background and have&#13;
enabled women to contribute savings to a fund from which credit is made&#13;
available in small amounts without collateral. Literacy, numeracy, and&#13;
nutrition training are important complements. Three types of activities,&#13;
in combination, could be promoted to expand income opportunities for rural&#13;
women: (a) loans for individual or group projects; (b) scaling-up of&#13;
successful pilot projects; and (c) new approaches. Group investment has&#13;
special merit, for it makes it possible for women to own or gain access to&#13;
more productive technologies, such as pedal threshers, shallow tube wells,&#13;
and back-pack rice hullers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Employment and Technology in Agroprocessing&#13;
In FY81, the volume of employment generated in the crop&#13;
processing subsector, dominated by rice (406 million man-days) but&#13;
including jute, wheat, sugarcane, oil seeds, silk, fruits, and vegetables,&#13;
was about 478 million man-days. The majority of work in crop processing is&#13;
carried out by women, using traditional techniques that are low-cost and&#13;
efficient in terms of use of capital, but characterized by very low labor&#13;
productivities and returns to labor. The subsector is a crucial source of&#13;
employment for landless and marginal families. However, since the 1960s,&#13;
there has been a massive increase in the proportion of paddy that is milled&#13;
(dehusked and polished) by capital-intensive techniques. An estimated 40&#13;
percent of output is currently milled in small rural or larger commercial&#13;
mills. The major factors in diffusion of this capital-intensive technology&#13;
are (a) cost reduction, basically by displacing hired labor, mainly&#13;
landless women; and (b) a response to greater quantities of paddy coming&#13;
onto the market, both privately and through government procurement schemes.&#13;
Proposals for further subsectoral development are often framed in&#13;
terms of large-scale processing plants that incur heavy foreign exchange&#13;
costs and create scant employment. Only dehusking and polishing are being&#13;
done outside the household, since the cost differential between the&#13;
household (using a foot-operated mortar and pestle, the dheki) and the&#13;
commercial mill is about 12:1. For other processes, the cost differential&#13;
is less than 2:1. Even including the lower output of rice from mechanized&#13;
steel hullers, transportation costs, and other hidden costs, it would still&#13;
be profitable for a large number of farmers to switch from the dheki to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
mill. In 1980/81, the amount of rice lost due to the use of steel hullers&#13;
rather than the traditional dheki, was valued at more than Tk 746 million.&#13;
With the establishment of some 10,000 steel hullers in rural areas, between&#13;
1.4 million and 2.0 million women have lost a traditional source of&#13;
productive part-time employment. With 700 new mills being set up annually,&#13;
another 100,000-140,000 women are being displaced each year. For landless&#13;
women, the loss represents about 55 percent of annual income and 15 percent&#13;
of family income. These displaced women, due to economic necessity, are&#13;
also the most likely to go the the mill site to seek employment, but the&#13;
number of jobs being created by the mills is about 20,000 permanent and&#13;
40,000 part-time positions. For those employed by the mills, the wages are&#13;
not commensurate to the increase in productivity per worker.&#13;
Employment Alternatives&#13;
In the face of this substantial displacement of female workers,&#13;
due to mechanization in rice processing, it is important to find&#13;
alternative productive activities. With increased crop diversification in&#13;
the agriculture sector, the processing of crops other than paddy represents&#13;
a significant source of employment for landless women. As with rice&#13;
processing, improved technologies will obviously play an important part in&#13;
handling higher levels of agricultural output, but experience with rice&#13;
processing suggests the low capacity utilization of large-scale plants for&#13;
processing crops grown on scattered small holdings. The possibility of&#13;
processing fruits, vegetables, and nuts with a view to import substitution&#13;
and possible export is also largely unexplored to date and merits&#13;
investigation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Identifying, developing, and disseminating appropriate&#13;
technological options are just as important in other industries as in&#13;
agroprocessing. If appropriate technology, with training and credit, were&#13;
made available to rural women, productive ventures at the village-level&#13;
would be stimulated. For landless women, the small-scale manufacture of a&#13;
wide range of goods, provided this opportunity is not preempted by&#13;
capital-intensive technology, could provide new opportunities for jobs.&#13;
Potential products are agricultural tools and accessories; silk and silk&#13;
by-products; building materials for housing and storage, and everyday&#13;
goods, such as rope, soaps, pencils, and umbrellas. Beyond the support of&#13;
Government policy, assistance in identifying investments, organizing&#13;
production groups, and access to financial support and training are&#13;
required.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
In Bangladesh, the landless or functionally landless and&#13;
households headed by women most need employment. Projects should aim at&#13;
creating alternative employment by upgrading traditional technologies.&#13;
Some 3.5 million-5.0 million man-days of employment need to be created&#13;
annually to compensate for displacement due to mechanization, particularly&#13;
in rice processing. Specific recommendations for the rice processing&#13;
industry are:&#13;
(a) Rural hullers should be neither encouraged nor&#13;
discouraged, but improving their performance and&#13;
converting them to renewable energy sources (rice&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
husks) should be considered. Extending credit to&#13;
women, enabling them to purchase and benefit from the&#13;
hullers' mechanical efficiency as owner-operators&#13;
should be encouraged;&#13;
(b) further investment in large-scale automatic commercial&#13;
mills with high foreign exchange costs cannot be&#13;
recommended. Expected efficiencies in production have&#13;
not been substantiated. Higher returns to investment&#13;
can be expected from incremental improvement in the&#13;
rural mills; and&#13;
(c) efforts to increase the mechanical efficiency of the&#13;
traditional dheki, so that the labor productivity of&#13;
women would increase, should be explored.&#13;
With increased agricultural production and crop diversification,&#13;
possibilities for employment and capital formation in rural Bangladesh&#13;
exist. To maximize the potential gains from forward and backward linkages&#13;
in the production-marketing process, the choice of technology should be&#13;
rationalized. Imported capital-intensive technology can be counter-&#13;
productive, as the experience of large-scale rice mills in Bangladesh&#13;
indicates, and similar mistakes should not be made in other industries. It&#13;
is strongly recommended that Government adapt to local conditions and&#13;
promote the use of small- and medium-scale technologies that are&#13;
economically viable on a small scale decentralized basis, with maximum&#13;
employment prospects and limited use of capital and scarce foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;

WOMEN IN RURAL BANGLADESH: POLICIES FOR THEIR EMPLOYMENT AND&#13;
OPPORTUNITIES IN CROP PROCESSING&#13;
PART I: DATA BASE ON WOMEN&#13;
A. Situation and Status of Women&#13;
Socio-cultural Context for Rural Women&#13;
1.        Many rural women in Bangladesh need to work in order to survive&#13;
but the rural wage economy is not prepared for them. According to the Gov-&#13;
ernment's 1981 Population Census, the total population is 89.9 million.&#13;
The rural population numbers 80.4 million and of these, nearly 39 million&#13;
women or 92 percent of the total female population live in rural areas&#13;
(Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 1981).     Data from the Bangladesh 1976&#13;
Fertility Survey indicate that while the overall male:female ratio is&#13;
108:100, the ratio in urban areas rises to 129:100. Many men working in&#13;
urban areas leave their families in rural areas. Bangladesh is a Muslim&#13;
society and the Islamic ideal of female dependence, derived from a man's&#13;
full responsibility to provide adequately for all the needs of the family&#13;
he heads, prevails. Thus, it is unusual for the birth of a girl to be&#13;
welcomed by the Islamic call to prayer as is the case of the birth of a&#13;
boy, and as a girl grows, this lack of recognition is perpetuated. Girls&#13;
are conditioned to accept inferior status and to feel that they are family&#13;
liabilities, not assets like their brothers. "Care of a daughter is&#13;
regarded as watering a neighbor's tree; you take all the trouble to&#13;
nurture the plant, but the fruit goes to some one else" (Mahmuda Islam,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1979, p. 245). Thus, when food supplies and other resources are scarce,&#13;
the best goes to the son and what is left, to the daughter. Poorer&#13;
nutrition among girls is reflected in mortality rates up to 50 percent&#13;
higher for girls under five years old, than those for boys. This is true&#13;
not only among the poor, but across all socio-economic classes.&#13;
2.        The socially acceptable role for a woman is that of wife and&#13;
mother, and from childhood, girls are trained for this role. At present,&#13;
the legal age of marriage for girls is 16 years, but this restriction is&#13;
largely ignored, and village girls are usually married at puberty, and by&#13;
age 17, 96 percent of females are or have been married. One consequence of&#13;
rural poverty is that poor nutrition, delaying as it does the start of&#13;
menstruation, may be contributing to a rising trend in mean female age at&#13;
marriage, which has been noted in the 1978 Bangladesh Fertility Survey.&#13;
The average age differential between a woman and her husband is nine&#13;
years. Because of age difference (not higher male mortality), widows&#13;
outnumber widowers in every age group. Widowed men frequently remarry&#13;
younger women. Widowed women seldom are able to remarry, and they and&#13;
their children often suffer economically and socially. Only women with&#13;
grown-up working sons have any hope of security upon a husband's death.&#13;
3.        The society is patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal.    After&#13;
marriage a girl moves to her husband's household, and as she is transferred&#13;
to her husband's family, her own kin identity is changed from father to&#13;
husband. In the first few years of marriage, strict seclusion is usually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
enforced. Often the household comprises an extended family, and the young&#13;
bride is expected to show deference and obedience, not only to her husband,&#13;
but also to his mother. The newest wife in a household has the most inferior&#13;
status, a situation that can change only if she bears sons. As long as the&#13;
distribution of land remains uneven and economic welfare is so closely&#13;
related to land ownership, those with little or no land need sons to work to&#13;
make up for it. The household and child-rearing are controlled by the&#13;
mother-in-law.&#13;
4.        A significant economic problem for families with daughters is the&#13;
cost of the bridal dowry required in most marriages, and brides tend to be&#13;
valued in relation to the amount of dowry they bring to their husband's&#13;
family. Many peasants are forced to sell or mortgage their land to pay the&#13;
dowry and with increased economic hardship, parents often renege on their&#13;
promise, causing great hardship to the bride who may be abused consequently.&#13;
It is customary for the husband to promise to give the bride an agreed sum of&#13;
money (or goods) as part of the marriage contract. When the agreement is not&#13;
honored, seldom is the bride in a secure enough position to claim it.&#13;
Further, the payment often is made to her father. Thus, a new bride is&#13;
totally dependent on her husband and his family.&#13;
5.        Many of the social prescriptions on women are rooted in and are&#13;
reinforced by the institution of purdah. Maintaining that sexual desire and&#13;
aggression are ever present and difficult to control, purdah is meant to&#13;
institutionalize restraint through social controls, by limiting contacts&#13;
between men and women and by creating social space for women (Papanek, 1973,&#13;
pp. 289-325).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
6.        Most discussions about the situation of women in Bangladesh note&#13;
that status and prestige are the critical variables in any aspiration to&#13;
change, and that&#13;
"The social ideology of status, set by the powerful,&#13;
controls the behavior of almost all women in the&#13;
village. If one is seeking to extend resources to poor&#13;
women to enable them to improve their economic&#13;
condition, one must understand how the ideology of&#13;
status limits the ways in which they can afford to&#13;
respond when new opportunities are offered" (Abdullah&#13;
and Zeidenstein, 1979, pp. 344-5).&#13;
7.        Traditionally, the work done by the women in a family indicates&#13;
its status. Relative idleness and freedom from menial work by women,&#13;
separation from men for all their activities, and strict observance of&#13;
purdah are symbols of high status, and thus reflect a family's influence&#13;
and power. Purdah is both an economic asset and a liability, and is costly&#13;
to maintain. Most rural women practice purdah in a manner that strives to&#13;
emmulate the ideal, yet allows for the economic realities of the family&#13;
situation. Restrictions of purdah tend to be relaxed among the very poor&#13;
out of econmic necessity or among the less poor when the trade-off is&#13;
economically advantageous. Almost all village women aspire to purdah and&#13;
the families in villages that can maintain it are highly regarded by all.&#13;
They control village values. Only economically secure families can afford&#13;
to support such behavior. Social status is not necessarily equated with&#13;
economic position, although the two often coincide. Low-status families&#13;
that are well-off seek to marry a son to a daughter from a higher-status&#13;
family.&#13;
"Status is a viable socio-economic asset in that it is&#13;
a basis for making good marriage alliances that will&#13;
sustain or improve a family's position and for main-&#13;
taining power, influence and control over&#13;
resources"(Abdullah and Zeidenstein, 1979, pp. 344-5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
8.       Many women in economic need will hide their deprivation, rather&#13;
than lower their status (and that of their children) by violating purdah&#13;
and doing work usually associated with lower-status women. Some do such&#13;
work in secret and earn some money without violating purdah. Their&#13;
dependence on others, because of limited mobility, exposes them to&#13;
exploitation by their families and middlemen.&#13;
9.        Economic class in Bangladesh is usually defined in reference to&#13;
ownership or control over land, and usually four classes are distinguish-&#13;
ed. Large landowners--the top 6-7 percent of rural households owning 45&#13;
percent of all cultivable land, with an average farm size of 5 acres; 15&#13;
percent of rural households cultivating farms of 2-5 acres, owning 25-30&#13;
percent of the land; small farmers--30 percent of rural households owning&#13;
20 percent of the land; and the lowest group--the landless or near landless&#13;
who, according to the Bangladesh 1977 Land Occupancy Survey, represents 48&#13;
percent of all rural households with 52 percent of the population. Of&#13;
of all households, 33 percent own homestead land but no cultivable land,&#13;
and 15 percent claim ownership or some land other than a homestead but no&#13;
more than 0.5 acre. Thus, they are functionally landless and depend on&#13;
wage employment for their livelihood. It is among the landless families&#13;
that women are most pressured to earn income. With a population that is&#13;
increasing rapidly, an already high population density (1,975 persons per&#13;
square mile), the number of landless households will continue to increase.&#13;
10.       Under Muslim law, a woman has the right to inherit a share (half&#13;
that of a brother) of her father's property. A married woman with children&#13;
inherits one-eighth of her husband's property. These rights, however, are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
seldom exercised, or if they are, the benefit is shortlived. Since as a&#13;
rule women do not do agricultural field work, a widow must depend on a male&#13;
to cultivate land, and this dependence puts her in a weak bargaining&#13;
position. The absence of male labor is a factor contributing to the low&#13;
income of households headed by females. Widows frequently lease out their&#13;
land at terms unfavorable to them, and often below their normal share-&#13;
cropping rates. They are prey to unscrupulous and powerful villagers who&#13;
find pretexts to gain control of their land. Further, a woman often does&#13;
not take her share of her fathers' land since doing so would reduce the&#13;
share for her brother, from whom she expects protection in the male&#13;
environment. Rather she prefers not to put at a risk her relations with&#13;
him and his support to her.&#13;
11.       Within a village, there are three tiers of household groupings&#13;
which define women's mobility. The smallest is the group of huts around a&#13;
courtyard. In the courtyard, paddy is dried, chickens and small household&#13;
animals are kept, and cooking and other domestic activities take place.&#13;
This settlement is called a chor and the residents are close relatives,&#13;
members of a patrilineal family: father, mother, sons and their wives and&#13;
unmarried children. Groups of chor form a bari, and several bari form a&#13;
neighborhood or para, several of which comprise a village.     Up to the para&#13;
level, frequently, residents are related through the males, and this is the&#13;
boundary for women's mobility. Women can move within the courtyard, or the&#13;
bari, and can visit from one bari to another, moving along sheltered paths&#13;
keeping out of sight of males, and they can do this most freely at times&#13;
when men are in the fields. During the monsoon, the bari often are cut off&#13;
from each other, and while men can move around by boat or on foot, this is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
not appropriate for women. Thus, women are isolated and have to depend on&#13;
men, children, older women whose seclusion is not a status requirement, or&#13;
a male servant for information, securing services, or selling their&#13;
products outside the para and beyond the village.&#13;
Health, Nutrition, and Fertility&#13;
12.       The general inferior station of women also affects their health&#13;
and has implications for their productivity. Their own health needs and&#13;
access to health care are subordinate to their status and are dictated by&#13;
their husbands and more important family members. Maternal mortality&#13;
accounts for some 27 percent of deaths of females aged 10-49 years. The&#13;
highest rates are related to first pregnancies due to childbearing at a&#13;
relatively immature age, to a series of five or more pregnancies (related&#13;
to the pressure to bear sons), and to infection from repeated childbearing&#13;
under unhygienic conditions compounded by malnutrition. Severe maternal&#13;
malnutrition also limits neonatal immunity and predisposes infants to&#13;
contracting communicable diseases. Nine percent of newborns die in their&#13;
first month, and twelve percent by the twelfth month. It is estimated that&#13;
more than five percent of the population suffers from protein calorie&#13;
malnutrition, which is most severe among young children and childbearing&#13;
women. A high incidence of other infectious diseases is attributable to&#13;
inadequate sanitation, contaminated water and serious overcrowding, and&#13;
two-thirds of the child population suffers from intestinal parasites, which&#13;
further aggravates malnutrition.&#13;
13.       Nutrition studies establish that pregnant and lactating women are&#13;
seriously deficient in protein, calories, vitamins A and C, and iron.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
Rural women breast-feed up to two to three years, frequently with very&#13;
little supplementary food. In addition to normal requirements, a full-term&#13;
pregnancy and lactation require, respectively, about 300 and 800 additional&#13;
calories per day. While prolonged lactation tends to depress fertility,&#13;
which is favorable in Bangladesh's situation of high population growth and&#13;
fertility rates (2.36 percent per annum, and 6.2 respectively, 1981), it is&#13;
deleterious to the health both of the child and mother.&#13;
14.       At health and medical centers, females represent 30 percent of&#13;
users, males 48 percent, and children 22 percent. At family planning&#13;
centers, female attendance is 65 percent, while that of males falls to 28&#13;
percent. Because the majority of doctors nationwide and at the centers are&#13;
male, many men refuse to let their wives be attended by them and many women&#13;
avoid them. There is great reliance on traditional health practitioners,&#13;
and modern doctors are seen only in extremis, often when it is too late,&#13;
and modern medicine is then judged as ineffective. Illegal abortions are&#13;
performed by traditional practitioners, and one study estimates 7.7&#13;
maternal deaths per 1,000 live births were due to abortion. Data checked&#13;
for 663 rural health clinics showed 1,590 cases of complications from&#13;
abortions treated, of which 31 percent had died (Shamima Islam, 1981, p.&#13;
13).&#13;
15.       As a whole, the population is poorly informed on basic health&#13;
care practices and nutrition. The shortage of food is compounded by a lack&#13;
of knowledge of nutritional requirements, the content of available food&#13;
supplies, or ways of using food for maximum dietary efficiency. Despite&#13;
experience in helping to care for younger siblings, young mothers know&#13;
little about basic child care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
16.       The 1981 Population Census shows an annual population growth rate&#13;
of 2.36 percent for the period 1974-81. In 1980, the total fertility rate&#13;
(the average number of children born to a woman who survives through- out&#13;
her reproductive period) had declined to 6.2, compared with 6.7 for&#13;
1974-81. For a large segment of the life of a woman in Bangladesh, she is&#13;
either pregnant or nursing, on average, having 11-12 pregnancies resulting&#13;
in five to six surviving children. Bangladesh has one of the highest&#13;
dependency ratios in the world. In 1980, 31 percent of the population was&#13;
under 10 years of age and another 12 percent between 10 and 14 years of&#13;
age. Forty-four percent of all males and 42 percent of females were&#13;
under 15. With such a young population, each year higher numbers of&#13;
females enter the reproductive age. Thus, even if by 1985 the net&#13;
reproduction rate could be controlled at one (i.e., each generation of&#13;
mothers having only enough daughters to replace themselves), the population&#13;
would still grow to 117 million by the end of the century.&#13;
17.       The Government, through foreign assistance projects, including&#13;
those financed with IDA credits, has been making serious efforts to&#13;
introduce family planning and control population growth. The challenges&#13;
posed by the sociocultural context described earlier to the success of&#13;
family planning programs should be obvious. Fertility remains highest&#13;
among the agricultural population, except among the landless laborers who&#13;
have the lowest fertility, partly due to their very poor nutrition.&#13;
18.       Family planning methods that are being advocated are directed to&#13;
women. Some 14,000 family planning workers, 48 percent of the employees in&#13;
the Population Divison of the Ministry of Population and Family Planning,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
are women. There are, however, very few women at the highest levels of&#13;
plan- ning or administration.&#13;
Education&#13;
19.       It is generally accepted that in addition to its inherent value,&#13;
education of girls has wide ramifications for a country's economic and&#13;
social progress. Literacy rates in Bangladesh are low, and lowest among&#13;
rural women over 25 years old. Only 14 percent of Bangladeshi women are&#13;
literate, compared to 29 percent of men. Of the few village girls who go&#13;
to school, most drop out at the fifth or sixth grade, at puberty. Since a&#13;
minimum of five years of schooling and some follow-up is necessary to&#13;
maintain literacy, there are many villages in Bangladesh where not a single&#13;
woman is literate. Apart from the requirement to observe purdah from the&#13;
onset of menses, many parents consider that what girls have learned by that&#13;
age is adequate for their future life. Studies of several communities have&#13;
found that there is a positive correlation between the amount of land&#13;
owned, the level of family income, and parent's educational level and the&#13;
enrollment of their children in school.&#13;
20.       Especially among landless families, children cannot enroll in&#13;
school, even when their parents would favor schooling, because the&#13;
children's labor is essential for the family economy. Where resources are&#13;
limited, investment in girls, who are expected to marry and leave the&#13;
family, is regarded as a waste of resources, and fewer girls are likely to&#13;
go to school. Even though schooling is free, the opportunity costs to&#13;
parents are high. Apparently, the most significant deterrent to educating&#13;
girls is the need for their services in large families. From&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
age 5 onward, girls are required to help their mothers with household&#13;
chores and mind siblings, and progressively, they must take on more&#13;
productive tasks. By the time they are about 10 years old, they are&#13;
husking grain or other such work.&#13;
21.        Only in the mosque schools, where they are taught mainly&#13;
religion, do girls predominate over boys. In these pre-primary age groups&#13;
students are taught mainly religion. At the mosque school, the teacher is&#13;
the male religious leader. There are also female religious instructors who&#13;
teach girls and boys in their homes. Many poor families "aspire to this&#13;
form of education for their girls, which raises their status in the&#13;
marriage market, but does not increase the potential cost of marriage which&#13;
to their perception is enhanced by the formal education" (Shamima Islam,&#13;
1979a, p. 94).&#13;
22.       The more education a girl has, the higher will be the dowry her&#13;
family must pay to get a suitable husband. If a family fails to pay all&#13;
the dowry, the girl is returned to her family and becomes a burden. In the&#13;
absence of suitable marriage offers for daughters, a family may prefer the&#13;
expense of keeping daughters in school beyond the fifth grade to the social&#13;
stigma of having unmarried daughters.&#13;
23.       The Government of Bangladesh has been making efforts to increase&#13;
female school enrollment, especially at the primary level. Its first Five-&#13;
Year Plan, 1973-78, set a target of 55 percent enrollment for girls, com-&#13;
pared to 90 percent for boys. Also, the Second Five-Year Plan, 1980-85,&#13;
set ambitious targets for reducing illiteracy through nonformal education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
programs as part of integrated income-generating and of integrated develop-&#13;
ment programs. Its targets include setting up community schools and learn-&#13;
ing centers, and free school uniforms (making of which would provide&#13;
considerable employment for rural women) for some 5 million girls.&#13;
24.       Girls represent 40 percent of the enrollment at primary level&#13;
(1983). Given these low enrollment rates and the high drop-out of girls at&#13;
this level, an extremely small proportion of girls is educated at secondary&#13;
and tertiary levels, respectively 20 and 16 percent of enrollment. Most of&#13;
the facilities for secondary and higher education are in urban areas. As&#13;
secondary education is not free, those enrolled are mainly daughters of the&#13;
more affluent. Girls have fewer curricular options than boys, and few&#13;
girls' schools offer science, and none offers agriculture or industrial&#13;
arts.&#13;
"While the country's development Plans focus on the&#13;
need for thousands of female middle-level workers with&#13;
certificates of matriculation, the course offerings are&#13;
not planned in a way as to enable schools to produce&#13;
girls who can be absorbed in these positions as soon as&#13;
they come out of school" (Shamima Islam, 1979a, p.111).&#13;
Limited education, of course, affects the availability of nurses,&#13;
nutritionists, paramedics, health visitors, and agricultural extension&#13;
workers. It also affects the numbers available to be trained as teachers,&#13;
without whom it will be difficult to make advances in providing primary&#13;
education for girls. Having more female teachers (only 8 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
teachers are female) has had a positive influence on female participation&#13;
in the labor force.&#13;
25.       The number of females studying at higher levels doubled from 1963&#13;
to 1973, but in 1983 still represented only 16 percent of enrollment.&#13;
While boys can contribute from their earnings to the costs of education,&#13;
girls, because cultural norms limit their opportunities to earn income,&#13;
must depend on their parents. Lack of residential accommodation for female&#13;
students is a further disadvantage. Most of the females in universities&#13;
come from urban families, and a trend of increasing enrollment of married&#13;
females has been noted at Dhaka University.&#13;
26.       Nonformal education programs for women are relatively new, and&#13;
apart from a few pilot efforts set up to reach rural women, most are&#13;
located in urban areas. These programs usually provide literacy and/or&#13;
skill training, and few specifically aim at improving the level of&#13;
knowledge and competence of rural women in the context of their daily&#13;
lives.&#13;
B. Women's Work&#13;
27.       Despite official statistics that indicate that only 12 percent of&#13;
Bangladeshi women are "economically active", various studies on rural&#13;
women's work in Bangladesh document that most females in Bangladesh over&#13;
ten years old work hard for long hours and that less than half their effort&#13;
is on "housework". In economically viable households, even at subsistence&#13;
level, women sometimes work 17 hours per day, while men work 11 hours.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Women often start work at 4:30 a.m. and finish between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m.&#13;
and their normal work load increases dramatically at harvest time (UNICEF,&#13;
1977).&#13;
28.       Studies in three villages of what production activities women&#13;
actually perform, rather than according to labor force definitions, showed&#13;
that 40 percent of rural females over 10 years old were active. Thirty&#13;
percent of these women engage in productive activities within the&#13;
household. TJnless they are too poor to afford segregation, they opt for&#13;
productive work that can be done in segregated surroundings (Rizwanul&#13;
Islam, 1979). They perform the usual female domestic, family reproduction,&#13;
and maintenance activities, the economic value of which has not been&#13;
measured. They also contribute significantly to both agricultural and&#13;
nonagricultural production, but since many of the activities performed are&#13;
complementary to those of men, integrated within the family and homestead-&#13;
based production unit and performed in seclusion, they are not recognized&#13;
as economic activities. Certainly, among the landless and families with&#13;
small holdings, horticulture and the entire post-harvest food processing,&#13;
preservation, and related processes are performed by women. These&#13;
activities have a great impact on the total production of the agriculture&#13;
sector. To demonstrate the importance of work done by women, time&#13;
allocation studies cited by Begum and Greeley compare an area where 47&#13;
percent of families own land and 40 percent of household income was earned&#13;
by women with an area where 76 percent of families own land and women&#13;
contribute only 20 percent of household income (Begum and Greeley, 1980a).&#13;
In the Comilla area village women spent 43 percent of their time on work&#13;
related to agricultural production,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
29.       While the villages of Bangladesh are not homogeneous and women's&#13;
work varies by region and its agricultural base and further by class and&#13;
status considerations, an attempt will be made to generalize the types of&#13;
tasks that the division of labor accords to women, drawing information from&#13;
microstudies of various areas of Bangladesh. These studies, which did not&#13;
all use a similar methodology, indicate the substantial economic contribu-&#13;
tion that women are making and suggest the need for a better accounting of&#13;
that contribution in the labor force. In view of the interdependence&#13;
between male and female work, there is need for a redefinition of "work" to&#13;
include what women do.&#13;
Crop Production&#13;
30.       Rice is the staple grain in Bangladesh and 60-80 percent of the&#13;
annual harvest is produced for home consumption. The field work is done by&#13;
men, and the tasks that are done after cutting and prior to consumption,&#13;
that is those done at the homestead, are done by women. Also, by cooking&#13;
one or two meals daily for hired labor, women contribute significantly to&#13;
laborers' wages. Each meal may take two hours to prepare, in addition to&#13;
the time previously spent husking and pounding the rice used for the meal.&#13;
Women help to select and they dry and store the rice to be used as seeds&#13;
and prepare them for sowing. Given the importance of rice to the family's&#13;
economy, this task is critical and requires repeated attention from the&#13;
women. It has been estimated that women's labor accounts for at least 25&#13;
percent of the value added from sowing onward in the production process of&#13;
rice. Except in the case of automatic rice mills, used mainly for the&#13;
government stockpile, mills only do husking and require women's input for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

the pre- and post-husking tasks. Since these tasks are done at the mill&#13;
site, away from the household, only women who are not status-bound do them.&#13;
31.       Most rice husking is still done by family labor, including some&#13;
reciprocal labor and a small proportion by hired women. It has been&#13;
estimated that if only 10 percent of the total rice production were husked&#13;
by hired women, it would produce 18 million man-daysl/ of employment.&#13;
About one month of employment for the poorest 5 percent of rural women&#13;
would result (Greeley, 1981).&#13;
32.       The sequence of rice-processing activities done by women are:&#13;
preparing the courtyard on which the paddy is dried by plastering it with a&#13;
fresh layer of mud and dung, helping with threshing to separate the grains&#13;
from the stalk, drying stalks to be used as cattle feed, winnowing and&#13;
sifting several times, parboiling and soaking, drying (often repeated&#13;
processes of spreading and sweeping), husking (if it is not sent to the&#13;
mill), winnowing to separate the bran from the chaff, and storage,&#13;
including periodic redrying. Grains that are not properly dried break in&#13;
husking or milling and spoil in storage, so women's judgment on its&#13;
moisture content before and during storage is critical, as is proper&#13;
preparation of the storage containers. Parboiled rice retains more&#13;
nutrients when husked and stores better and, again, women's judgment is&#13;
important. A courtyard's size limits the amount of rice that can be dried&#13;
at any one time, and if small, adds to women's work load. Women may&#13;

actually perform different processes on several lots of rice simultaneous-&#13;
ly. It has been noted that rice dries two to three times faster on paved&#13;
roadways than in a courtyard, and this technique is becoming popular.&#13;
High-yielding varieties of rice take longer to dry because their husks are&#13;
thicker and they yield larger amounts for processing. Also, women fetch&#13;
fuel for the fire and the water for parboiling and soaking. The contribu-&#13;
tion of this effort is, however, seldom considered, since gathering fuel&#13;
and fetching water are regarded as part of women's domestic responsibil-&#13;
ities. Women also contribute much of the labor to the post-harvest&#13;
processing of wheat and other food grains that are less important than rice&#13;
in Bangladesh.&#13;
33.       Women are involved in the post-harvest processing of jute, the&#13;
second major crop in Bangladesh. After cutting, the stalks are allowed to&#13;
rot in water, then the stripping of the jute fiber from the stalks is done&#13;
by both men and women, as is the drying and storing of the fiber. Jute&#13;
stalks are used for fencing, which is also done by men and women. The&#13;
making of jute rope and other articles from jute fibers is done by&#13;
women 2/&#13;
34.       Most families have homestead plots, and even on those that are&#13;
extremely small, they try to grow some other crops such as vegetables,&#13;
2/   The Bangladesh Jute Research Institute is developing a machine to&#13;
strip the fibers from the stalk. BJRI shows photographs of its&#13;
extension agents demonstrating the prototype only to men, although&#13;
surveys show clearly that this is a female task.&#13;

spices, and oil seeds to supplement their rice diet. This cultivation is&#13;
done entirely by women who prepare the land, sometimes digging and&#13;
transporting earth with which to level the land or make the beds. They&#13;
plant seeds, tend the plants, and bring water for them. Women with access&#13;
to irrigation water work the pumps at night. They use ashes as insecticide&#13;
and manure as fertilizer, if it can be spared from fuel requirements.&#13;
Fencing the plots is their responsibility, and they pick, process, and&#13;
preserve the crop. They sell or trade any surplus, usually through males.&#13;
Women also plant fruit trees and process and preserve the fruit. As with&#13;
rice, women are responsible for selecting and storing the seeds for most&#13;
crops. During the monsoon, the homestead gardens provide essential&#13;
nutrition, but unfortunately, half of such production is derived from three&#13;
vegetables (radishes, eggplant, and bottle gourd) with little nutritious&#13;
value. Women's work fluctuates with major crop cycles; the two heaviest&#13;
demands on them coinciding with the two rice harvests. In Bangladesh there&#13;
are basically two crop seasons, the monsoon season (June-September) and the&#13;
winter season (October-February), with a dry summer period for March-May.&#13;
During slack periods, women work on repairing storage facilities,&#13;
preserving food, making oil, flour and flour products, and puffed or&#13;
flattened rice.&#13;
Animals&#13;
35.       Care of all animals is the responsibility of women.    Bullocks&#13;
are, after land, a farmer's most valuable asset. Women maintain them,&#13;
collecting fodder to feed them three times a day, taking care of their&#13;
health, seeing that they are bathed, securing them at night. Women clean&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
their stalls and store the manure to use as fuel and fertilizer. For cows,&#13;
they do the same and also milk them to provide milk for the household and&#13;
for sale. Women raise goats which are kept in a shed with the bullocks or&#13;
in the house. If possible, a child grazes them; if not, women feed them&#13;
leaves. Women use and sell goat's milk and also sell the goats. More&#13;
women are also raising chickens, and one study noted that "a small family&#13;
with no additional income can live on the profits of a poultry farm of 150&#13;
birds" (Shireen Rahman, 1977, p. 3). Ducks are raised, but they require&#13;
more care, especially to keep them from eating the rice crop. Chickens and&#13;
ducks and their eggs are also a source of cash. Not infrequently animals&#13;
are raised on a share-cropping basis.&#13;
Other Work&#13;
36.       Nothing is wasted, and all agricultural and kitchen residues have&#13;
their use: rice husks and stalks and dung are used for fuel; straw, bran,&#13;
and peelings are fed to cattle, and food scraps to chickens and ducks;&#13;
water used to wash rice and pulses is fed to cattle or used to water&#13;
plants; banana leaves are used when rice must be covered temporarily; ashes&#13;
from stoves are used for washing and as fertilizer and insecticide; leaves&#13;
and stalks are used to make nets for hanging, baskets for winnowing, drying&#13;
nets, fish traps, and brooms; threads from worn-out saris are used to make&#13;
quilts for bedding. Women also make mud stoves for cooking. Women in the&#13;
families of potters do some of the work in pitching and drying pots; and&#13;
those in the families of weavers do a share of the weaving. In these and&#13;
other such activities performed traditionally by families, women have&#13;
clearly demarcated tasks, which they perform as unpaid labor and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
conjunction with their household responsibilities. Many traditional&#13;
implements for the household are made by women.&#13;
37.       It is clear that all of these tasks require both skill and&#13;
judgment. However, the earnings of women, e.g., from the sale of surplus&#13;
vegetables, chickens, or baskets, are diluted because of women's dependence&#13;
on men to market them. Because of isolation, women have little information&#13;
about market values and accept what is offered to them. As often is the&#13;
case with women's income-earning activities, marketing is poorly arranged,&#13;
and in Bangladesh, women are further disadvantaged by their seclusion.&#13;
38.       It is clear, too, that these activities of women receive very&#13;
little attention in government programs. Given the low status and the&#13;
constraints which the culture accords women, they have not been in a&#13;
position to make claims on the system for services to upgrade their skills&#13;
and increase their productivity. This perpetuates their low status. The&#13;
lack of information about women furthermore impedes efforts to develop such&#13;
programs. Women's lack of access to information limits their participa-&#13;
tion, even when programs exist.&#13;
Household Maintenance&#13;
39.       Women in Bangladesh do the child care, cooking, and cleaning&#13;
activities typical of women in the developing world. Women aged 15-64&#13;
years spend some six hours per day on household maintenance, compared with&#13;
50 minutes for men. Firewood is very scarce and much time and energy are&#13;
required to collect fuel, including dung which women dry and store for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
burning. A 1980 energy survey showed that dung and jute sticks represented&#13;
35 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of domestic fuel, and that 80&#13;
percent of crop residues were so used. The Energy Sector review, 1984,&#13;
shows that 60 percent of total energy used in Bangladesh is supplied from&#13;
traditional sources, crop residues, and animal wastes, but end-use&#13;
efficiency is low--10-15 percent. In Bangladesh, women also repair their&#13;
houses, which men construct. The monsoon rains often damage them and they&#13;
have to be replastered. Customarily large family size and extended demands&#13;
of breast feeding must be factored into the work required of rural women.&#13;
Women in the Labor Force&#13;
40.       An increasing number of rural women require wage labor, because&#13;
their families are either below or at subsistence level. Also increasing&#13;
is the number of such households that are headed by women. Estimates of de&#13;
jure female-headed households (households headed by widowed or unmarried&#13;
women) range from 6.4 percent to 16 percent of rural households. The&#13;
number of defacto female-headed households will range higher. Many of&#13;
these rural women are landless and are seeking wage employment in a labor&#13;
market that has, to date, restricted female access (Chen, 198i, pp. 6-7).&#13;
The poorest households depend on wage employment for a living and are found&#13;
to mDbilize their entire workforce, regardless of sex, to ensure bare&#13;
subsistence. A survey (March-June 1979) of 238 households whose women&#13;
worked as wage laborers showed that 64 percent were still married; 87&#13;
percent had a daily laborer as husband; 69 percent owned no crop land; and&#13;
36 percent had 4-6 living children. And 62 percent of them gave&#13;
insufficient income as the reason for starting to work; other reasons were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
a husband's illness or death or divorce (Begum and Greeley, 1979). As&#13;
shown by the following table, the proportion of women entering the labor&#13;
market varies inversely with level of household income:&#13;

41.       Some women are able to earn income through work that does not&#13;
seriously compromise their status, that is, by income-generating activities&#13;
such as making handicrafts for sale, raising livestock, buying and&#13;
processing paddy for sale as rice, and selling surplus vegetables and&#13;
cooked articles at their households. The majority, however, must break&#13;
purdah to find wage labor. The most common activity is to work in the&#13;
households of others, processing rice or doing household chores and menial&#13;
tasks, including taking meals to field laborers. Women also work as&#13;
agricultural laborers. A survey in the Comilla Upazilla found that female&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
laborers were employed on farms larger than 1.5 acres and the number&#13;
increased with farm size. Only 23 percent of land holding families had&#13;
never engaged women for payment (Martius von Harder, 1975, p. 74).&#13;
42.       In rural areas, there are very few nonagricultural employment&#13;
opportunities available to women. One is the spinning and weaving of silk&#13;
which is being encouraged as a cottage industry. Information from one silk&#13;
factory indicates a 6:5 ratio of male to female workers. A survey of rural&#13;
industries sponsored by the Bangladesh Small Scale and Cottage Industries&#13;
Corporation (BSCIC) in 11 Upazilla, showed 34.5 percent of 217,000 workers&#13;
to be women; however, women were paid less than the men (Salahaudin,&#13;
1982). Since the early 1970s, the Government has operated various labor-&#13;
intensive rural work programs. Workers in some of these employment schemes&#13;
receive cash wages, in others they receive food as payment. Women partici-&#13;
pate in the food-for-work programs (FFW).   Many of the FFW projects involve&#13;
activities such as canal and pond digging, road building, rehabilitation of&#13;
derelict tanks and earthworks which can be done only in the drier months&#13;
(January to May), and so they are a very temporary source of income. When&#13;
men have done the amount of work to qualify for their payment, they can go&#13;
elsewhere and work as agricultural laborers. For women, this is not&#13;
possible, in part, because there are fewer opportunities, and also, because&#13;
they must do their household maintenance work as well. Ninety percent of&#13;
the families of women working on FFW projects are landless, and the need&#13;
for food for their families is their reason for working. Many spend 3-4&#13;
hours per day travelling to and from projects, and nearly one-quarter bring&#13;
children to the work site, because they have no other child care. Half of&#13;
the women working on FFW projects had work experience in rice processing,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
including the mechanical rice mills. The majority of families, conscious&#13;
of the women's contribution to the family's welfare, endorsed their&#13;
efforts (Marum, 1981).&#13;
43.       In some cases, family and social criticism is so persistent that&#13;
women, trapped between the contradicting and conflicting demands of social&#13;
status and economic desperation, are persuaded to give up work on the&#13;
projects (and the income they earn).&#13;
44.       Conversely, however great their need, many women are unable to&#13;
find work that provides sufficiently for their families' subsistence. One&#13;
study shows that female heads of households find wage labor for 17 percent&#13;
of total man-days, compared to 41 percent for male heads of households.&#13;
For all types of income-generating work, women find work for 63 percent of&#13;
man-days and men for 83 percent (Cain, Khanam and Naha, 1979). Not only do&#13;
women have fewer opportunities to work for wages than men, but for each&#13;
task they also earn appreciably less than men. In the Comilla area, women&#13;
earned a maxi*um of 1.4 kg. of rice as two meals a day, plus Tk 2--compared&#13;
with a male wage of Tk 8-10 daily. Wage rates are higher during the&#13;
harvest periods than at other times, and seasonal variations in wages are&#13;
higher for women than for men. In some areas, opportunities for urban&#13;
factory employment have attracted rural males away from the land, leaving&#13;
women to do field work at Tk 8 per day, compared to Tk 20 per day for men.&#13;
Women earn more from field work than from other types of wage work, but in&#13;
terms of earnings and numbers of days worked, the best employment opportun-&#13;
ities for rural women are in rice processing. "During non-processing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
periods, employment is even more irregular and earnings decline to one meal&#13;
for a half-day's work, and two meals for a full day's work, with no in-kind&#13;
payment of rice" (McCarthy, 1980, p. 6).&#13;
45.       There is much uncertainty and irregularity about the terms and&#13;
methods of payment to women which makes it difficult to compare male and&#13;
female rates. Calculations converting in-kind wages to a cash equivalent&#13;
give a mean daily wage of Tk 4.27 for women and Tk 6.63 for men, and show&#13;
that the highest female wages are lower than the lowest male wage (Rizwanul&#13;
Islam, 1979). Among, the few advantages in the wage system for women is&#13;
that in a period of rapidly rising prices, the real value of payment in&#13;
kind plus meals--which women generally receive--increases.&#13;
46.       Women's access to information is limited by their seclusion, and&#13;
on FFW projects, for example, it was found that the rates paid to women&#13;
varied (to their disadvantage) frequently, because they did not know the&#13;
market rates, nor could they measure the amount of work they had done and&#13;
so compute their correct earnings. On one project, a simple innovation--a&#13;
pole marked with appropriate work lengths--gave the women an easy check&#13;
(Marum, 1981).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
47.       Because of deteriorating socio-economic conditions in rural&#13;
areas, unemployment will increase during the next plan period and&#13;
technological changes, such as the increased introduction of rice mills,&#13;
may displace many women without generating additional employment. A survey&#13;
of mill use (July 1980) revealed "that 73 percent of the farmers who have&#13;
now started to use the rice mill were employers of female wage labor and&#13;
since these users accounted for 66 percent of all employers of female wage&#13;
labor, there will be a massive reduction in female wage labor demand"&#13;
(Begum and Greeley, 1980a, p. 14).&#13;
C. Women and Change&#13;
48.       The social and economic position of women in the rural society of&#13;
Bangladesh is weak, and they bear a considerable work load in productive&#13;
activities, as well as in household maintenance and reproduction. The&#13;
households headed by women are particularly disadvantaged and the absence&#13;
of working males in a household is a factor in its impoverishment. There&#13;
are constraints to the access of women to education and health services and&#13;
women have limited opportunities for nonformal education and wage labor.&#13;
Women and others who are poor are often unable to talke advantage of&#13;
programs, even those targeted at them. In the rural works program, their&#13;
poverty prevents them from owning or renting the necessary tools. Women's&#13;
domestic work load and efforts to earn income leave little time for other&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
49.       There is increasing destabilization of the economy at the local&#13;
level evidenced by "more wage-based rather that independent forms of&#13;
production, increasing indebtedness, land fragmentation, and growing&#13;
insecurity and impoverishment. At the family level, problems are similar;&#13;
changing social relations among family members, new demands on people's&#13;
time, changes in decision-making among family members, increasing&#13;
dependence on the wage labor of the husband and wife as well as&#13;
children ... and a general erosion of once relatively stable living&#13;
conditions" (Feldman, 1982, p. 2).&#13;
50.       The Second Five-Year Plan (1980-85) recognized women and youth as&#13;
the most disadvantaged element of the population for whom it would provide&#13;
"programs aiming at their socio-economic emancipation and skill development&#13;
for effective participation in nation-building." The objectives included&#13;
generation of employment opportunities, particularly for women (Second&#13;
Five-Year Plan, 1980-85, para. 8.46). Among the steps taken by the&#13;
Government were the earmarking of 10 percent of all employment in&#13;
Government and para-statal organizations for the appointment of women and&#13;
establishment of a National Women's Association. A Women's Ministry&#13;
created in 1978 was merged with the Ministry of Social Welfare to become&#13;
the Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
51.       The Government has established or sponsored several organizations&#13;
that bane programs for women. Also women's programs are run by a number of&#13;
voluntary nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) required to register with&#13;
various ministries and government departments. These programs operate&#13;
independently of each other and vary widely in their primary objectives.&#13;
Most share the common purpose of organizing women and raising their social&#13;
status. Many emphasize training and income-generating activities. Several&#13;
inventories of these programs have been made, giving various estimates of&#13;
their number. A 1981 inventory by UNICEF lists 326 registered organiza-&#13;
tions, for which information was available on 214 of them. About 13&#13;
percent of these organizations were sponsored by the Government, less than&#13;
2 percent by international organizations, and the remainder was privately&#13;
sponsored. They were concentrated unevenly thoughout the country, with&#13;
most, 99, in Dhaka.&#13;
52.       In general, Government has initiated policies and programs for&#13;
women from a welfare perspective. Thus, few of these programs address the&#13;
real needs of women, and further they reach relatively few of those in&#13;
need. "The larger part of planning for women having been done by men, and&#13;
for rural women having been done by urban based male bureaucracies, have&#13;
suffered the heavy load of unrealism" (Ahmad and Mahtab, 1978, p. 172).&#13;
Few Government programs offered training for agriculture and livestock, and&#13;
a particularly neglected area is agricultural extension. The extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
service with more than 16,000 village extension workers, "overlooks the key&#13;
role rural women play in the economy. This may be ascribed to deeply&#13;
rooted beliefs .... towards women's participation in economic activities"&#13;
(Shamima Islam, 1978, pp. 129-30). In general, programs for women make&#13;
inadequate provision for training, and for the selection of the most&#13;
critical fields for training. Pretominant attention has been given to&#13;
fertility control in conjunction with income generation, based on the&#13;
understanding that raising women's status might contribute to reducing the&#13;
birth rate in Bangladesh.&#13;
53.       Village studies show that "... rural women employed in paid work&#13;
cause significant changes in the socio-economic living pattern of the&#13;
village" (Ahmad, 1980, p. 60). In recognizing that women's income is&#13;
essential to maintaining or improving the family's standard of living,&#13;
males and other family members are changing their opinions on women's&#13;
status. Women themselves are able to buy things for their children and see&#13;
them better fed and consider their own status improved. In 1978, when the&#13;
Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) started in one village to&#13;
organize production groups of women (they started with house to house&#13;
visits through their medical programs), "the women were at first not able&#13;
to leave their homes on their own. When they formed their group, local&#13;
religious leaders opposed, threatening to expel the women from society.&#13;
The threat, however, could not be carried out, said field workers, as other&#13;
women in the village supported the group. It was with the help of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
women's group that a 12-member men's group was later formed" (Fuller, 1980,&#13;
p. 22). The women's group used the economic support from BRAC for paddy&#13;
husking, and the men's group organized cooperative paddy cultivation.&#13;
54.       Experience has shown that the most economically disadvantaged&#13;
groups respond slowly to programs that do not offer possibilities for&#13;
generating income. Because of their illiteracy, lower standing in the&#13;
social hierarchy, inadequate access to institutional services such as&#13;
credit, and their perception about their income earning potential, these&#13;
groups--the small farmers, landless laborers, and share croppers--have&#13;
benefitted little from various rural development programs (Hye, 1981, p.&#13;
27).&#13;
55.        Among the socioeconomic schemes inducing change by providing&#13;
opportunities for increasing family income are those of the International&#13;
Union of Child Welfare (IUCW) and the Rural Social Service (RSS). For the&#13;
poorest families in selected villages, these schemes provided training and&#13;
financial and technical assistance to help them set up income-generating&#13;
activities; other activities included functional education and family&#13;
planning. Most of the women were trained in handicraft production. A 1981&#13;
evaluation noted that 35 percent of those involved were women and in&#13;
addition to economic benefits to the villages and individual families,&#13;
social awareness developed among village women, and there was less&#13;
dependence on the family head and greater participation in the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Families were spending some of their increased earnings on educating their&#13;
children and more children of both sexes over 10 years were enrolled in&#13;
school than the national average (Alauddin and Sorcar, 1981).&#13;
56.       One objective of an evaluation of the women's development program&#13;
of the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (BARD) was to identify&#13;
problems faced by women participating in development activities. In&#13;
keeping with the guiding principles of the Academy the program encouraged&#13;
self-reliance, cooperation, and group pressure as important forces for&#13;
production and to protect the rural poor from exploitation. Problems&#13;
identified included: the preference of educated village women for wage-&#13;
earning jobs outside the village created a leadership vacuum among women in&#13;
villages; women's involvement in project activities required female mobil-&#13;
ity which men resisted; two types of cooperative societies were operating,&#13;
joint and women's, and in the former, women were being deprived of their&#13;
benefits and unable to withdraw their savings; women accumulated savings in&#13;
the cooperative societies slowly and needed interim financial and other&#13;
assistance to initiate projects; and the lack of support for women in the&#13;
existing social and power structure in the village created barriers for&#13;
women (Qadir, 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
57.       In 1982, OXFAM evaluated the experience of the Saptagram Nari&#13;
Swanirvar Parishad, an NGO working with poor women in three regions of&#13;
Bangladesh and whose income-generating activities were utilized both for&#13;
group formation and for raising women's consciousness. It was found that&#13;
the relationship between the groups and the project workers, who were&#13;
alternately functioning as organizers and money lenders, bore too close a&#13;
resemblance to the rural elite of the area who indulge in money lending and&#13;
usury; most of the members benefitting from the program's training in&#13;
tailoring and embroidery were middle-class women; and the spinners trained&#13;
under the sericulture project were without work because growers failed to&#13;
supply the raw materials. The literacy program was particularly valued by&#13;
the women, because due to their inability to read and write, women said&#13;
that they were previously cheated by others and were not in a position to&#13;
encourage their children to acquire literacy skills.&#13;
58.       Among the agencies offering women nontraditional training are:&#13;
(a) UNICEF, which has trained women as bank workers and for pump&#13;
maintenance; (b) CARE, which has trained women to vaccinate poultry; and&#13;
(c) Gonashasthya Kendra (GK), which includes women in wood and mechanical&#13;
workshop training. While the numbers are small, GK trains both girls and&#13;
boys 15-20 years old, with at least a fifth grade education. They are&#13;
trained to make metal and wood articles for local use and also in&#13;
shoemaking, and receive a monthly allowance, out of which they pay for food&#13;
and boarding while training and the costs of continuing formal education.&#13;
They also work on the center's farm which provides the bulk of its food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
However, the usefulness of such training is limited because of the&#13;
inability of graduates to acquire the tools and necessary machinery for&#13;
productive employment. On the positive side, the trained females are&#13;
considered desirable marriage partners, and this reflects an important&#13;
social change.&#13;
59.        Raising poultry has become very popular for generating income&#13;
among village women, but is a very risky endeavor because birds often&#13;
contract diseases and die, a loss which the poor cannot afford. To help in&#13;
solving the problem, the CARE Women's Program selected older, poor, married&#13;
women, who showed an interest, and trained them to vaccinate poultry as a&#13;
way of earning income. They do immunizations twice monthly, covering&#13;
250-350 birds each time in some 90 villages. Literacy is not a basis for&#13;
selection, and record keeping has been made very simple. The program is&#13;
run in conjunction with CARE's poultry farm which supplies improved breeds&#13;
of birds to the women and has had very good results. Its main difficulty&#13;
is ensuting the supply of vaccine which must be refrigerated. CARE's head&#13;
office in Dhaka receives supplies from the Government livestock service,&#13;
and CARE extension workers transport the vaccine to villages in insulated&#13;
flasks, and from there the "village vet" carries these vaccines in banana&#13;
stalks.&#13;
60.       UNICEF introduced a successful scheme to train women to maintain&#13;
water pumps being installed in Bangladesh. Even though women often have&#13;
the greatest incentive to ensure that pumps are in working order, they are&#13;
rarely taught how to operate, maintain, and repair them. The pumps were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
originally intended to provide domestic water, but are now being used&#13;
widely for irrigation, although they are not efficient for that purpose,&#13;
and require a substantial amount of energy to draw water. Many groups&#13;
among the poor, including women, are borrowing money under affordable&#13;
credit schemes to purchase pumps in order to sell water. Maintenance&#13;
demands will increase, and the UNICEF project may have opened new earning&#13;
opportunities for rural women in maintenance and selling water. UNICEF has&#13;
also assisted a rural banking project under which female bank workers are&#13;
being trained to offer door-to-door banking services to rural women, thus&#13;
providing banking facilities to them for the first time.&#13;
D. Lessons of Project Experience and Proposals for Action&#13;
61.       It would be impossible to discuss in detail the multitude of&#13;
women's projects being conducted by the numerous NGOs in Bangladesh. Some&#13;
have succeeded in meeting objectives, some have failed, and still others&#13;
have only been able to function because of heavy external support, a high&#13;
staffing ratio, and the commitment of the program organizer. Although&#13;
numerous, these programs have reached a relatively small proportion of the&#13;
disadvantaged population. However, their experiences suggest features that&#13;
would be important for programs developed to expand the scope of opportun-&#13;
ities for income-generating employment among rural women (Alauddin, 1982).&#13;
A realistic approach takes into account the cultural constraints, the&#13;
capacities of illiterate women, and the limited markets for their services&#13;
and products. It appears that the more successful programs have assisted&#13;
women to work in groups from the same economic class and to contribute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
savings to a fund from which they can borrow and have credit available in&#13;
small amounts without collateral. To take account of the women's limited&#13;
mobility and extreme poverty, programs have usually been organized in&#13;
keeping with the women's capacities; in addition to skill development, the&#13;
programs have provided literacy, numeracy, and health and nutrition train-&#13;
ing. Some of the women's programs were integrated into rural development&#13;
projects, and many untraditional activities for earning income were&#13;
encouraged among women.&#13;
62.       To be successful in reaching rural women, projects must be based&#13;
on "an awareness that particular manifestations of rural women's behaviour,&#13;
such as ... desired number of children, food consumption patterns,&#13;
education of daughters, are responses to their total socio-economic&#13;
situation. Project approaches based on a partial view are not likely to&#13;
succeed ... women like men act out of self-interest ... seeking to the best&#13;
of their abilities, in society as it exists, to satisfy their needs ....&#13;
However, we must recognize that the cultural or socio-economic pressures&#13;
experienced by women as a sex (varying with, but not negated by class) as&#13;
they pursue security and survival are different from those facing men"&#13;
(Abdullah and Zeidenstein, 1979).&#13;
63.       Regarding program content, education and training are&#13;
imperatives. What women do currently demands considerable skill and&#13;
judgment (e.g., in rice drying), but these activities are traditional,&#13;
characterized by low productivity, thus low earnings. Many income-&#13;
generating activities being fostered build on these skills or require other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
relatively low-level skills, for which a woman's educational level is not&#13;
significant. To gain command of information and awareness that are&#13;
prerequisites for women to take advantage of new opportunities, more&#13;
efforts in nonformal education must be made to reach women, especially&#13;
younger adult women, who were by-passed by the formal system. The pre- and&#13;
in-service training of trainers merits attention so that they become&#13;
resource persons in the teaching-learning situation. "Teachers working&#13;
together with the women they train help them to understand their own needs,&#13;
and reach their own solutions" (Shamima Islam, 1979b). Also important is&#13;
gearing the content of programs to women's roles, responsibilities, and&#13;
functions, and ensuring functional links between the training and skills&#13;
developed with concrete benefits to the participants in satisfying their&#13;
needs.&#13;
64.       Three types of activities together could be promoted to provide&#13;
income opportunities for rural women: (a) loans for individual or group&#13;
projects; (b) scaling-up of successful projects; and (c) new approaches.&#13;
(a) With small individual loans, women can achieve little more than&#13;
raising a few poultry or goats, developing small trade in&#13;
preserves, puffed rice, or rice cakes, or hoarding paddy, rice,&#13;
and mustard seed to sell when prices rise. Low risk, quick&#13;
return, and familiarity make the paddy-rice business a very&#13;
popular investment. Several of the NGO programs that made credit&#13;
available to women claim great success in increasing income and a&#13;
very low level of default. Women as a group can make large&#13;
investments in such activities as weaving fish nets for sale or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
rent, fish farming in ponds, or cultivating leased land. Group&#13;
investment also makes it possible for women to own more&#13;
productive technologies, e.g., the custom-operated pedal&#13;
thresher, shallow tube well, and back-pack huller (Begum and&#13;
Greeley, 1980b, p. 11). Groups of landless women in Chittagong&#13;
are taking loans for purchasing hand pumps and getting seeds from&#13;
UNICEF for vegetable gardens. The profitability and repayment&#13;
experience of these ventures has been positive. At present,&#13;
there is little risk of the women's efforts competing with each&#13;
other, but as programs expand, competition could become a&#13;
problem. Any new activity should be based on economic cost and&#13;
return estimates, rather than relying on the support or&#13;
enthusiasm of the project officer.&#13;
(b) Small numbers of women are employed for wages in the labor-inten-&#13;
sive rural works program mentioned previously, in small-scale and&#13;
cottage industries promoted by the Bangladesh Small-Scale and&#13;
Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), and in various jute&#13;
handicraft training and production centers run by NGOs. Some&#13;
programs could be expanded or replicated. There is, however, the&#13;
ever-present problem of marketing. Jute is very dependent on an&#13;
external fashion market, and the market for silk is also extern-&#13;
ally oriented. For products produced for local consumption, the&#13;
market is extremely small because of poverty (GNP per capita of&#13;
US$120 in 1981). One of the more successful local ventures is&#13;
dessicated coconut produced by the Mennonite Central Committee&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(MCC), and a search for other products that could be competitive&#13;
on the local market might be rewarding.&#13;
(c) Finding new avenues of employment is not easy since numerous&#13;
schemes (usually directed to men) have been tried in Bangladesh.&#13;
Suggestions for new outlets for female wage labor have in common&#13;
that they would be for the local market, run and managed by&#13;
women, and would employ women. They might include manufacture of&#13;
pottery such as clay stoves, jars, irrigation pipes and tiles;&#13;
also products that women make for local consumption, such as flat&#13;
rice, could be commercialized. For landless women, beekeeping&#13;
for honey, using low-cost hives, and expansion of silkworm-&#13;
rearing have been suggested.&#13;
65.       As noted, rural women really have no "spare time." To earn&#13;
income and be able to take training, they can find time either by placing&#13;
greater household burdens on their children, who in the poorest households&#13;
are already doing a lot so that mothers can gain wage employment, or by&#13;
working on tasks which can be done conjointly with household work, and&#13;
these are likely to be very low-productivity activities.&#13;
66.       The development of simple and inexpensive improvements in&#13;
household technologies (e.g., more efficient stoves) could remove some of&#13;
the drudgery and release time from household work, and their manufacture by&#13;
local artisans would also provide employment opportunities. Another&#13;
benefit from these improvements would be less demand for the labor of&#13;
children, especially girls, enabling them to go to school which would yield&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
long-term benefits to the society. And further, fertility is likely to&#13;
decline as the economic value of children diminishes.&#13;
67.       Combined with efforts to advance household technology and the&#13;
productivity of food processing with relatively simple and inexpensive&#13;
improvements, efforts should be made to improve dietary practices. The&#13;
least effort has been expended on nutritional education among the poor who&#13;
can least afford waste. The nutritional quality of the limited quantities&#13;
of food available to the poor could be improved. This could be an aspect&#13;
of a two-part program to encourage production and consumption of vitamin-&#13;
rich foods, and also better preventive health. Women would be the primary&#13;
targets for such a program, since they have the main responsibility for&#13;
health and nutrition in the family. However, it is important that men and&#13;
also children in the primary school system be involved.&#13;
68.       The project experiences suggest that, when directed at poor&#13;
women, poverty-focused programs do not benefit the poorest, especially&#13;
when women of different economic classes are grouped together. The less&#13;
needy and more economically powerful usually take advantage of the&#13;
resources being made available, except where programs require a self-help&#13;
component requiring public labor. "By emphasizing self-help, specifically&#13;
the active labor inputs of the members themselves, a 'self-selection'&#13;
mechanism has worked on a number of occasions to remove richer and&#13;
therefore more status-conscious women ... where the group made a decision&#13;
to dig a pond or work on land they leased-in, the less poor members left&#13;
the group for reasons of prestige" (Begum and Greeley, 1980a, p. 17).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Self-help has encouraged more careful use of the fruits of the group&#13;
members' own labor as well as group cohesiveness. Efforts should be made&#13;
to encourage some programs organized specifically for groups of the poorest&#13;
women, to be based on self-help and collective activity. The programs of&#13;
BRAC3/ and Grameen Bank,4/ which also included use of group members'&#13;
savings for a risk fund from which individuals could borrow, have been&#13;
useful pilot experiences suitable for replication.&#13;
69.       Although in recent years a great deal has been written about&#13;
women in Bangladesh, much of the hard data required for policy and planning&#13;
are not available. "The lack of accurate and extensive data on the range&#13;
of rural women's productive activities hampers a clear evaluation of their&#13;
present employment situation, and more importantly, hampers an overall&#13;
understanding of employment demands related to crop processing, storage,&#13;
seed selection and preservation" (McCarthy, 1980, p. 3). It is clear that&#13;
women's work adds economic value; it also saves expenditure, and this too&#13;
is not counted. Better documentation and valuation of this work is needed,&#13;
as is information on working conditions and productivity, seasonality, and&#13;
earnings. The number of women seeking wage labor will increase with the&#13;
rising cost of living and growing landlessness and impoverishment in rural&#13;
areas, but better data on the likely patterns of increase and regional&#13;
characteristics are needed for targeting programs. Therefore, efforts&#13;
should be made in future censuses and relevant surveys to include such&#13;
3/   Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, an NGO set up in 1972 as a&#13;
small relief agency, is now the premier NGO engaged in extensive rural&#13;
development activities.&#13;
4/   Grameen Bank, financed by the Bangladesh Bank, functions independently&#13;
as an NGO on the principle that access to financial resources is the&#13;
principal constraint to self-employment for millions of poor people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
information on women. In view of the importance of the agriculture sector&#13;
for rural employment opportunities, the women's section of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Forests has a unique role in collecting information.&#13;
70.       The Ministry of Social Welfare and Women's Affairs has an&#13;
important function as a catalyst for focusing attention on the situation of&#13;
rural women in Bangladesh. Among its priorities, it might attempt to&#13;
institutionalize a specific reference to women in a review of the&#13;
employment implications of Government policy and programs. It is important&#13;
that this review be in the early stages of policy formulation and planning.&#13;
It is also important that this ministry participate in discussions related&#13;
to external assistance in order to ensure that implications for women are&#13;
taken into account in designing projects. The Ministry should also&#13;
disseminate information about women; a start might be made by synthesizing&#13;
the existing literature on women in Bangladesh and drawing policy and&#13;
program implications from it. Further, the Ministry should promote better&#13;
coordination among programs to avoid overlap and duplication, and also&#13;
assist in identifying the most appropriate NGO programs for scaling up and&#13;
replication to meet the needs that the Government with its own resources is&#13;
unlikely to satisfy.&#13;
71.       As an example of a specific program intervention that the&#13;
Ministry could undertake, it might encourage in the rural works and food-&#13;
for-work programs special provisions for female workers, such as separate&#13;
work sites, employment of child care attendants, schemes enabling women to&#13;
acquire tools, female representation on project implementation committees,&#13;
and protection of their rights as workers. "The employment of female labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
is as yet not easily acceptable to recruiting officials, and perhaps would&#13;
need promotional support being placed under government recruitment quota&#13;
orders" (Ahmad, 1980, p. 383). It is often assumed that in economies with&#13;
high unemployment, priority should be given to providing employment for men&#13;
in order to secure subsistence for a family. In the case of the rural poor&#13;
in Bangladesh, the earnings of women are often critical to a family's&#13;
survival. Thus, special income-generating programs for women are&#13;
necessary. The issue of women's employment should not be considered in&#13;
isolation, however. Rather, it should be regarded as part of a total&#13;
employment strategy where women contribute to overall purchasing power and&#13;
to the welfare of individual families.&#13;
72.       The introduction of 700 rice mills in Bangladesh each year dis-&#13;
places 3.6-5 million man-days of employment for landless females, a very&#13;
serious issue. A discussion of possibilites for creating employment&#13;
opportunities for women through the introduction of appropriate&#13;
technologies in agro-processing follows.&#13;
PART II: CROP PROCESSING&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
73.       Crop-processing activities are the biggest source of rural&#13;
employment in Bangladesh. Recent studies estimate that the labor in rice&#13;
processing represents at least 25 percent of labor in rice production and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
that in jute production approximately 35 percent of man-days involved are&#13;
used in processing activities (Greeley, 1981). Thus, in FY81, the volume&#13;
of employment generated in processing these two major crops is estimated at&#13;
406 million man-days for rice5/ and 52 million man-days for jute.6/ The&#13;
volume of rural employment created through the processing of other crops,&#13;
such as wheat, sugarcane, oil seeds, silk, fruits and vegetables, is lower&#13;
but still significant (wheat processing 3.3-4.0 million man-days; gur&#13;
(sugar cane) production 3.5 million man-days; oil pressing 3.3-5.4 million&#13;
man-days; and silk 3-4 million man-days.7/&#13;
74.        Several characteristics of the crop-processing sub-sector in&#13;
Bangladesh need to be highlighted. First, the majority of the work is&#13;
carried out by women: indeed, crop processing (which can be carried out&#13;
within the homestead) is one of the few opportunities for productive&#13;
employment open to rural women in Bangladesh. Second, the sub-sector&#13;
provides a valuable source of employment and income for landless and&#13;
marginal families whose members earn a significant proportion of household&#13;
income through working as casual laborers for farmers with surplus crops or&#13;
through processing crops purchased from the market. Third, crop processing&#13;
is still predominantly carried out using traditional techniques which,&#13;
although low-cost and efficient in their use of capital, are also&#13;
5/   Based on acreage of 25 million acres at 65 man-days per acre.&#13;
6/   Based on acreage of 1.4 million acres at 105 man-days per acre.&#13;
7/   Wheat estimate based on acreage of 1.0 million acres at 20 man-hours&#13;
per acre (6 hours per day) for threshing plus nominal employment for&#13;
milling; sugar estimate based on 63,665 persons employed and 55 days&#13;
of employment per worker per year. Bangladesh Institute of Develop-&#13;
ment Studies (BIDS), 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
characterized by very low labor productivities and low returns to labor.8/&#13;
Fourth, when new technologies have been introduced successfully, the major&#13;
factor in diffusion appears to be cost reduction rather than reduction of&#13;
food loss; and since the cost saved is that of labor, there has inevitably&#13;
been a significant displacement of hired (landless) workers, especially&#13;
women. Fifth, although larger quantities of surplus crops coming onto the&#13;
market in recent years have focused more attention on this previously&#13;
neglected sub-sector, proposals for its development increasingly are framed&#13;
in terms of the introduction of large-scale processing plants that involve&#13;
heavy foreign exchange costs and create little new employment either&#13;
directly or indirectly through the local manufacture of processing&#13;
equipment.&#13;
75.       The Second Five-Year Plan (1980-85) estimates that employment in&#13;
crop processing will increase in proportion to growth of 3.2 percent per&#13;
annum in agricultural output. The trends noted above suggest that this&#13;
assumption is probably unrealistic and given the actual and potential&#13;
8/   Estimates for capital and labor productivities and cost per workplace&#13;
in various crop processing activities using traditional techniques,&#13;
and in grain milling using an improved moderately capital-intensive&#13;
technology   are as follows:&#13;
Output/            Output/          Capital/&#13;

importance of crop processing in terms of providing employment for landle-ss&#13;
women, the following sections attempt to examine the extent to which the&#13;
rational and appropriate choice of technologies and their diffusion to&#13;
landless women can help them and their families to contribute to and&#13;
benefit from the development process.&#13;
B. Demand for Labor in Rice Processing&#13;
Nature and Extent of Mechanization&#13;
76.       After paddy harvesting, the sequence of operations necessary to&#13;
convert it into rice is: field stacking, transportation, farmyard&#13;
stacking, threshing, winnowing, drying, dehusking, polishing, and storage.&#13;
When carried out with traditional techniques, these operations place a&#13;
heavy burden on farm family labor (especially women who perform all&#13;
operations from threshing onwards) and create a high demand for casual&#13;
female labor, especially for threshing, dehusking, and polishing.&#13;
77.        Increases in production due to changes in cropping patterns and&#13;
the introduction of high-yielding varieties have led to increased pressure&#13;
upon post-harvest facilities. The impact on the demand for farm family and&#13;
hired labor has, in turn, been affected by the extent to which increased&#13;
paddy yields have been sold in unprocessed form and more mechanized tech-&#13;
niques are used. If output can no longer be processed by family members&#13;
with existing techniques, alternatives, separately or in combination must&#13;
be pursued: more labor must be hired, more paddy sold in unprocessed form,&#13;
or the productivity of family labor must be increased through capital&#13;
inputs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
78.       Of the post-harvest operations, only dehusking and polishing have&#13;
been mechanized significantly. Until the late 1960s, these operations (the&#13;
most time-consuming of all post-harvest activities) were undertaken almost&#13;
entirely at the farm level, using manual techniques, the most common of&#13;
which is the dheki (a foot-operated mortar and pestle).9/ Since then,&#13;
there has been a massive increase in the proportion of paddy milled&#13;
(dehusked and polished) by more capital-intensive techniques, with an&#13;
estimated 40 percent of output now being milled in small rural or larger&#13;
commercial mills. The rate and extent of mechanization of milling is shown&#13;
in Table 2.&#13;

9/   About 2 pounds of paddy can be placed in the mortar at one time.&#13;
Generally, rice is processed in three passes through the dheki with&#13;
separation of husk and bran after each pass. The by-product separated&#13;
from the first pass is mainly husk. That from the second pass is a&#13;
mix of husk and bran and that from the third pass is mainly bran. In&#13;
some cases where hulling is done by a different method, the dheki is&#13;
used for polishing only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
79.       The most commonly used rural mill is the steel (Engleberg)&#13;
huller, using either electric motors or diesel engines (15-25 HP). These&#13;
use mainly a single pass, but double-pass hulling is also practiced. In&#13;
most cases, the rice, bran and husk must be winnowed and separated later by&#13;
women. Facilities for soaking and parboiling are sometimes offered. The&#13;
mills are normally owned by small entrepreneurs and primarily perform&#13;
custom services for neighboring farmers and small traders. Consignments of&#13;
paddy vary between 5 seers (4.67 kg.) and 4 maunds (149.60 kg.) with the&#13;
average being 0.25-0.50 maund (9.33-18.66 kg.).10/&#13;
80.       Commercial mills are primarily "non-modernized" and use batteries&#13;
of four or five steel hullers milling with single or double passes. These&#13;
are driven by flat belts from a line shaft powered by steam engines (using&#13;
husk as fuel) or by diesel or electric motors. These mills also offer&#13;
soaking and parboiling facilities (the latter sometimes using steam&#13;
generated from a simple boiler). Female labor is hired to carry out&#13;
drying, pre-cleaning and winnowing operations using scaled-up traditional&#13;
techniques. Mill owners may operate a wholesale business and/or may work&#13;
on contract to the Ministry of Food milling paddy procured by the&#13;
Government. Customers are normally bulking traders and most of the rice&#13;
processed is aimed at urban markets.&#13;
81.       Also, in the commercial sector are a number of modern integrated&#13;
mills using rubber roll hullers and offering a full range of services.&#13;

handled automatically and rice, bran, and husk are produced already&#13;
separated. There are also a few semi-automated mills that differ only in&#13;
their use of sundrying rather than mechanical drying. Since these&#13;
processing plants are imported in entirety, foreign exchange costs are&#13;
high, being typically 30-50 percent of total capital investment. All&#13;
equipment, including dryers, are run by electricity. Since batches of&#13;
1,000 maunds of paddy are typically required for economic efficiency, the&#13;
Government is the mills' main customer, since this amount of paddy is&#13;
beyond the means of most private traders. Owners of these mills are&#13;
private companies, cooperatives, or Government.&#13;
82.       The capacity and capital costs of mills vary enormously.     Rural&#13;
hullers present especially difficult estimation problems, since their&#13;
capacity varies from 15 maunds to over 35 maunds per hour, depending on&#13;
their size. Capital costs of rural mills also vary according to the size&#13;
and type of structure in which they are housed, ranging from a bamboo and&#13;
thatch hut costing Tk 1,000 to a brick and corrugated iron building costing&#13;
Tk 40,000 (Ministry of Agriculture, 1978). A general estimate of the&#13;
capital cost and capacity of the various types of mills and of the dheki is&#13;
presented in Table 3. Estimates of the number of employees and the capital&#13;
cost per workplace are also given.&#13;

Compiled from estimates given in the Ministry of Agriculture's Task Force&#13;
Report, 1978; Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Rural&#13;
Industries Studies Project, 1981; Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee&#13;
(BRAC) Annual Report, 1981. Other characteristics of Dheki and Rural Mill&#13;
are given in Annex I.&#13;
83.       Annual capacities for mills are worked out of the basis of a&#13;
250-day working year at 8 hours per day.1l/    On this basis, installed&#13;
capacity in 1981 was just over 10 million tons of rice per annum, of which&#13;
approximately 9 million tons were accounted for by rural hullers and the&#13;
remainder by commercial mills. Given earlier estimates of 40 percent of&#13;
production being husked in mills, a high degree of under-utilization of&#13;
installed capacity (40 percent of production in 1980-1981 was slightly more&#13;
than 8 million tons) is indicated.&#13;
11/  This is what is known as "efficient" capacity and takes into account&#13;
factors in the productive environment such as the seasonality of&#13;
agro-processing. Engineering capacity, which is often used in&#13;
prefeasibilty studies, is based on a 300-day working year at 20 hours&#13;
per day. It is generally accepted that this is an unrealistic&#13;
estimate and that, in any case, the level of operating and maintenance&#13;
costs rises sharply as it is approached. Most prefeasibility studies&#13;
for modern rice mills in Bangladesh seem to be worked out on the basis&#13;
of a 300-day working year at 16 hours per day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
84.       Available evidence supports the fact that mills are not used to&#13;
full capacity. In the case of rural mills, this shortfall can be partly&#13;
explained by the pauses necessary between the small consignments of&#13;
customers. Double hulling also lowers capacity and this practice is&#13;
necessary with some varieties of paddy (especially HYVs). Old machines and&#13;
poor management have also been cited as reasons for low capacity&#13;
utilization. More recently, power failures and competition from newly&#13;
established mills have been given as explanations. In 1977, the average&#13;
capacity utilization of rural rice mills was estimated at 57 percent, but&#13;
is estimated to have declined since (Ministry of Agriculture, 1978, pp.&#13;
19-21).&#13;
85.       Commercial rice mills (both non-modernized and modern) also have&#13;
a poor record of capacity utilization with estimates varying from 9 percent&#13;
to 50 percent. In 1978, the Ministry of Agriculture's Rice Task Force&#13;
found 50 percent of commercial mills not operating at all and the other 50&#13;
percent working at 20-30 percent capacity. More recent estimates from&#13;
Bangladesh Shipla Bank show that almost one-third of commercial mills are&#13;
not operating and that capacity utilization of installed modern mills has&#13;
never exceeded 50 percent. Explanations relate to poor management, power&#13;
failures, lack of sufficient consignments of paddy and, in the case of&#13;
fully automated plants, an inability to use mechanical dryers because of&#13;
high cost, thus limiting processing capacity to the amount which can be&#13;
sundried. The main problem here is obviously one of space which is&#13;
especially problematic if the mills are located in urban areas.&#13;
86.       Some mechanization of other post-harvest processes has also&#13;
occurred. The introduction of pedal threshers has been ongoing in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Bangladesh for more than 20 years, but their use has spread very slowly&#13;
outside Comilla district. Diffusion is increasing, particularly in areas&#13;
where short, stiff-strawed varieties are grown. The threshers are locally&#13;
manufactured in large cooperative workshops (for example, the Comilla&#13;
Cooperative Karkhana produces 2,000 per annum) and in small workshops which&#13;
produce two to three a year. The threshers now cost about Tk 1,000 each,&#13;
are operated by one man or woman, and have an output of 80-100 kg/hour,&#13;
roughly five times the output obtained using manual techniques.&#13;
87.        Improved dryers (using a variety of- fuels including solar energy)&#13;
are being introduced at the small farmer, cooperative, and large storage&#13;
unit/mill levels. Capacities vary from 20 maunds to 2,000 maunds of paddy&#13;
per day and capital costs from Tk-l,000 to Tk 900,000. As yet, no&#13;
acceptable small farm-level dryer has been developed; experiments at the&#13;
cooperative level have failed for a variety of reasons and tests on&#13;
large-capacity dryers installed in government storage areas in northern&#13;
Bangladesh have yet to be carried out.12/ As mentioned above, fully&#13;
automatic rice mills incorporate sophisticated mechanical.dryers, which are&#13;
used rarely because of the high cost of operation. In short, practically&#13;
all paddy produced in Bangladesh is still sundried in the traditional way,&#13;
either on mud floors/mats at the household level or on concrete/brick paved&#13;
yards at the large mill level.&#13;
12/ One reason given by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI)&#13;
engineers for the failure to develop an appropriate household-level&#13;
crop dryer is that male engineers have been unable to communicate&#13;
adequately with the women who traditionally carry out the process of&#13;
crop drying. Similarly, one of the reasons given for the failure of&#13;
cooperative drying schemes is that the process is being transferred to&#13;
men who do not have the traditional skills of women in this task.&#13;
(See Harris, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
88.       Mechanization of other processes such as pre-cleaning, soaking,&#13;
and parboiling is restricted to automatic and semi-automatic mills. There&#13;
have been a few laboratory experiments to develop improved technologies for&#13;
use at the small-farm level. In some cases, soaking and parboiling&#13;
equipment on a scaled-up level is used in larger rural mills and in&#13;
non-modernized commercial mills, but an estimated 90 percent of these&#13;
processes are still carried out by women at the bari (household) level&#13;
using traditional techniques.&#13;
Cause and Impact of Mechanized Milling&#13;
Factors in the Spread of Rural Hullers&#13;
89.       The major factor influencing the spread of rural rice mills is&#13;
cost reduction. The comparative costs for milling and total processing at&#13;
the ba   level and in rural mills in 1977 is shown in Table 4.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
90.       The cost differential in milling between the household and&#13;
commercial mill is about 12:1, enabling mill owners to charge very low&#13;
rates for milling (rates vary between TK1.2 and TK 3.0 per maund) while&#13;
making very high profits. Investment in a mill is thus a very profitable&#13;
proposition. For other processing the cost differential is less than 2:1&#13;
and explains why this activity is still largely carried out at the&#13;
household level, with only the husking/polishing operation being an&#13;
attractive proposition outside the household. The proportion of family&#13;
labor involved in other processing is greater than in husking/polishing.&#13;
Also, the cost of female labor used for other processing is less than the&#13;
cost for dheki work; in addition, when other processing is carried o'ut at&#13;
the mill, more or less traditional techniques are used and apart from some&#13;
lowering of costs due to economies of scale, significant cost reduction is&#13;
not achieved.   -&#13;
91.       The demand for milling services comes predominantly from surplus&#13;
farmers who can dispense with the relatively more expensive dheki method&#13;
using hired female labor. These differential costs do not reflect the&#13;
transportation costs involved in using a mill or the relatively lower&#13;
output of rice for a steel huller versus the dheki.13/ The difference in&#13;
output of rice is approximately one seer (0.93 kg) per maund (37.33 kg),&#13;
costing Tk 3.46 in 1977. Small loads (0.25 to 0.50 maund) are generally&#13;
head-carried to the mill by a male family member and in some instances&#13;
involve an opportunity cost to the family. For larger loads, boats or&#13;
13/ Recent estimates based on field work give a milling yield of 72.02&#13;
percent from dheki and 69.94 percent from a rural mill. (Greeley,&#13;
1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
carts are used, with significant economies of scale in transportation. As&#13;
seen in Table 5, with "hidden" costs taken into account, it is still&#13;
profitable for a large number of farmers to switch from the dheki to the&#13;
mill.&#13;

1977 = Tk 9.39 x 0.50 x 0.75 = Tk 3.52.&#13;
92.       On the supply side, investment in mills has increased with the&#13;
spread of cheap, subsidized electricity that allows even greater profits to&#13;
be made. In one area of the Tangail district, for instance, within a year&#13;
of connection to the electricity grid, the number of mills increased from&#13;
four (diesel) to 18 (electric). (Greeley, 1981).&#13;
93.       The marked increase in energy costs, both diesel and electricity&#13;
which account for a high proportion of total milling costs, has obviously&#13;
had an impact on milling charges and/or profits. The costs of energy in&#13;
1977, 1980, and 1982 are given in Table 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Electricity (Tk per Kwh)            0.60        1.25        1.75&#13;
94.       In the case of an electric mill, variable costs are estimated at&#13;
72 percent of total costs of milling, and energy costs are 84 percent of&#13;
variable costs. In 1977 when the average cost of commercial milling was&#13;
Tk 1.00 per maund,14/ energy costs at this time were Tk 0.61 per maund.&#13;
In 1980, electricity charges rose to Tk 1.25 per maund and, holding&#13;
everything else equal, the cost of milling rose to Tk 1.64 per maund.&#13;
Surveys of rice mills conducted before the 1982 price increases show the&#13;
average charge for milling in electric mills to be Tk 3.0 per maund;15/&#13;
mill owners passed on 83 percent of the rise in energy costs to their&#13;
customers. Charges for milling in diesel mills in 1981 ranged from Tk 5-&#13;
Tk 7 per maund. Energy costs increased again in 1982, but the effect on&#13;
milling charges is not yet analyzed. There is evidence that numerous mills&#13;
(presumably the less profitable ones) are being forced to close due to&#13;
rising energy costs, but this phenomenon is not widespread. However, in&#13;
anticipation of even higher energy costs, now is a good time to start&#13;
thinking in terms of finding alternative renewable and locally available&#13;
14/ This is the average cost from the 14 mills surveyed in the 1978&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture Task Force Report, most of which were electric&#13;
mills.&#13;
15/ This is the average cost from the 50 mills surveyed by the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture (1981)--again the majority of mills were electric.&#13;

- 56 -&#13;
sources of energy for operating rice mills.16/    Rising energy costs may&#13;
also make it worthwhile to investigate further the possiblity of improving&#13;
the mechanical efficiency of the dheki so as to make it more cost-&#13;
competitive with the rural mill.&#13;
Factors in the Spread of Automatic Rice Mills&#13;
95.       Commercial processing facilities have spread in response to&#13;
greater quantities of paddy coming onto the market, both privately and&#13;
through government procurement schemes. Non-modernized commercial mills&#13;
were established in marketing and urban centers, which handled large&#13;
quantities of bulk traded Government-procured paddy. Operating with&#13;
batteries of steel hullers, many mills expanded to meet demand simply by&#13;
adding more hullers to the production line. On average, such mills have&#13;
about four to five hullers working, handling a capacity of up to 900 maunds&#13;
per day.&#13;
96.       More recently, individuals in the private sector have put forward&#13;
several proposals for loans to invest in modern rice-processing plants.&#13;
Fully automatic mills typically have a capacity of 9,600 tons per year (55&#13;
maunds per hour, 16 hours per day, 300 days a year) but, unlike the older&#13;
non-modernized mills, they involve a high content of foreign exchange in&#13;
total capital investment. Further, the older commercial mills utilize&#13;
predominantly locally manufactured equipment, as well as a significant&#13;
amount of female labor to carry out pre-milling operations using scaled-up&#13;
16/ Some experimentation is already going on with Sterling Engines using&#13;
riceshusks but there would also seem to be great potential in&#13;
nve t gating the technological and economic possibilities of using&#13;
improved small-scale steam engines utilizing rice husks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
household technology, while the modern plants use imported equipment for&#13;
pre-cleaning, soaking, parboiling, and drying operations.&#13;
97.       In 1977, although half the existing commercial mills were non-&#13;
operational and many others were operating below capacity, 25 proposals for&#13;
large-scale processing plants had been submitted, and only two were imple-&#13;
mented. By 1981, some of these additional proposals were approved and&#13;
implemented. The situation in 1981 is shown in Table 7.&#13;

98.       Private sector interest in investment in modern rice mills is&#13;
prompted by anticipation of high rates of return, and Government encourages&#13;

such investment because of concern to have access to adequate processing&#13;
facilities for increasing volumes of procured paddy.&#13;

than 1,000 maunds of paddy, and since very few traders in the private&#13;
sector have sufficient capital to invest in this amount of paddy, most&#13;
prefer to take their trade to non-modernized mills. The modern rice mills,&#13;
then, are almost totally dependent on securing contracts from government&#13;
for processing procured paddy. Although the commission paid by government&#13;
for milling paddy is only Tk 5.1 per maund, profits can still be made,&#13;
given the "hidden" subsidies involved in government contract work.18/&#13;
Indeed, rates of return on capital are generally calculated in&#13;
prefeasibility studies as 25-30 percent per annum.&#13;
100.      In practice, however, problems have arisen and the performance of&#13;
modern mills has been far from satisfactory. In combination, a shortage of&#13;
power, lack of sufficient quantities of government and privately procured&#13;
17/  This is the cost figure given by BSB on the basis of a 300 day year&#13;
working two shifts of eight hours each day. When working at lower&#13;
capacities, the average cost of milling rises. For instance, the Task&#13;
Force investigation in 1977 estimated that one modern mill which had&#13;
never operated at more than 9 percent of capacity had operating costs&#13;
of Rs. 20.83 per maund. With recent rises in energy costs, this would&#13;
now be Rs. 26.00 per maund.&#13;
18/ Hidden subsidies consist of the right to retain and sell any rice&#13;
recovered over and above the agreed rate of 64.2 percent, plus all&#13;
by-products such as broken rice, bran and husk. For project&#13;
proposals, the sale of such products per maund of paddy milled is&#13;
estimated at Tk 11.47. This adequately compensates for the difference&#13;
between the milling rate and the theoretical cost of milling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
paddy, the high operating costs of mechanical dryers, and poor management&#13;
have resulted in low capacity utilization, which raises the costs and&#13;
reduces profits. In some cases, special measures have been necessary to&#13;
enable a mill to operate. For instance, the modern rice mill in Comilla&#13;
(installed in 1973) now operates through a special dispensation of the Food&#13;
Ministry which permits a milling commission of 150 percent of the normal&#13;
Tk 5.1 per maund. Given current and planned capacity of commercial mills&#13;
(1,902,000 tons annually) in relation to current and anticipated volumes of&#13;
government-procured paddy (1,270,000 tons annually), it seems unlikely that&#13;
commercial capacity utilization would improve significantly.&#13;
101.      Under the circumstances, further investment in modern rice mills&#13;
would appear unwise, especially since many of the reasons given by&#13;
Government for favoring them (higher milling efficiency, lower percentage&#13;
of broken grains, superiority of drying techniques) have not been&#13;
substantiated in practice.&#13;
102.      The large and increasing volume of government-procured paddy&#13;
necessitates modernized, high-volume mills, but if ready-processed rice&#13;
(having already been milled in various parts of the country in non-modern-&#13;
ized commercial mills, rural hullers and by dheki) were procured by&#13;
Government, then the need for automated processing facilities would be&#13;
correspondingly lessened.&#13;
103.      The spread of modern rice mills is encouraged by the "milling&#13;
cost compensation" element in official procurement prices for paddy and&#13;
rice. Based on the paddy/rice conversion ratio of 3 to 2, a "rice&#13;
equivalency price" of paddy per maund of milled rice can be estimated. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
difference between the rice equivalency price of paddy and the official&#13;
procurement price for milled rice is the "milling cost compensation"&#13;
element in the procurement price for rice. Depending on the actual cost of&#13;
milling, this compensation may be a disincentive, or a sizeable incentive&#13;
to milling. For example, using 1979/80 prices of Tk 96 per maund, the&#13;
"rice equivalency price" of paddy was Tk 144 (= 96 x 3/2) per maund of&#13;
milled rice. Thus, at a price of Tk 154 per maund for rice, the "milling&#13;
cost compensation" was Tk 10 per maund which, with milling costs at Tk 3&#13;
per maund and total processing costs at Tk 6 to 7 per maund, represented a&#13;
substantial incentive towards providing ready-milled rice. Notably, the&#13;
volume of paddy procured in its unprocessed form in that year was at a low&#13;
level (295,000 tons).&#13;
104.      An analysis of changes in official procurement prices for paddy&#13;
and rice reveals that milling cost compensation has declined, thus&#13;
increasing the incentive to dispose of unprocessed paddy through the&#13;
government procurement scheme. Table 8 shows these changes along with&#13;
levels of paddy procured by government.&#13;

105.     As a policy matter, it is important to rationalize differentials&#13;
between paddy and rice procurement prices and to increase the rice&#13;
procurement price relative to paddy so as to restore and enhance the&#13;
incentive for grain sellers to offer milled/husked rice to the government&#13;
for procurement. Storing milled rice requires significantly less storage&#13;
space than storing unmilled paddy; the unit cost incurred by Government for&#13;
commercial milling, including the indirect costs of repeated hauling and&#13;
rebagging of paddy, is significantly higher than the price differential&#13;
between milled rice and paddy; the large majority of sharecroppers and&#13;
small farmers mill their own paddy and sell it as rice (and thus, returns&#13;
to small-scale processing and women's groups running husking businesses&#13;
would increase with a higher rice price); and many landless laborers&#13;
(predominantly women) are deprived of employment and income if farmers sell&#13;
their output to the government as paddy.&#13;
Impact of Mechanization on Output and Employment&#13;
106.      A frequent argument favoring mechanized post-harvest operations&#13;
cites reduction of food losses as an advantage, but the spread of steel&#13;
hullers and automatic rice mills has had a limited (even negative) impact&#13;
on such efficiency. At the same time, the steel hullers in rural areas&#13;
have resulted in significant displacement of female workers, while the&#13;
automatic rice mills have, in addition, used up substantial amounts of&#13;
scarce capital and foreign exchange.&#13;
107.      Output of rice from the steel huller is actually lower than from&#13;
the dheki (69.94 percent compared to 72.02 percent).     In addition, fewer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
grains are broken with the use of the dheki (28-30 percent compared to&#13;
30-54 percent) and it gives a less polished rice.19/ Also, when using the&#13;
dheki, it is easier to separate the bran and husk than when a steel huller&#13;
is used. With 30 percent of the country's paddy production milled in steel&#13;
hullers (rather than dheki), 3.5 millon maunds of rice valued in 1980/81&#13;
prices at more than Tk 746 million are lost.&#13;
108.      Other effects of the steel huller are less easy to quantify.    The&#13;
higher proportion of broken grains results in a lower price. However, the&#13;
better polished rice, even though less nutritious, has a higher market&#13;
price. Broken grains sell for Tk 90 per maund, compared to Tk 170 for&#13;
rice. Although bran and husk are rarely sold, a certain amount of wastage&#13;
occurs in that the entire mixture is used either as fuel (thus wasting the&#13;
protein value of the bran) or as animal feed. In other countries, simple&#13;
screens are fitted to steel hullers to help with the separation of&#13;
by-products, but this procedure has not been tried in Bangladesh.&#13;
109.      In general, solutions to the problems associated with steel&#13;
hullers have been sought not in promoting a return to the dheki or in&#13;
improving the efficiency of the huller, but in promoting the use of large&#13;
automatic rice mills. In theory, these mills should provide a higher&#13;
recovery of rice, lower percentage of brokens, higher quality rice, lower&#13;
moisture content, and better quality by-products than steel hullers.&#13;
However, in practice, the automatic mills have not been as efficient as&#13;
planned. For example, the percentage of brokens is not as low as specified&#13;
19/ Less polished rice is more nutritious than highly polished rice which&#13;
has had all of the germ/bran removed and although it fetches a lower&#13;
price In urban markets, it is widely preferred in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
by makers, due to differences in rice varieties; breakage levels are also&#13;
affected by the high moisture content of the paddy when mechanical dryers&#13;
are not used. The quality of rice is not as high as expected because&#13;
farmers tend to offload their poorest quality paddy to the government&#13;
procurement systems and low-quality paddy yields low-quality rice. In any&#13;
case, there is no evidence of premium prices for high-quality rice in&#13;
Bangladesh, and the price difference between the top and coarsest varieties&#13;
is only 20-25 percent, thus, expenditure on equipment to improve quality is&#13;
not easy to justify.&#13;
110.      The most significant impact of the spread of steel hullers in&#13;
rural areas has been on the employment of rural women. As seen in Table 3,&#13;
the rural huller, on average, has-a capacity of 160 maunds per eight-hour&#13;
day, compared to the dheki's capacity of 1.3 maunds. Each mill (if working&#13;
at capacity) displaces 123 dhekis, each of which provides part-time&#13;
employment to two or three female operators. In theory, each mill could&#13;
displace between 250 and 370 women, although, in practice, assuming&#13;
capacity utilization of 57 percent, the number would be 142-200 women.&#13;
With an estimated 10,000 steel hullers in rural areas, between 1.4&#13;
million-2.0 million women have lost a traditional source of productive&#13;
part-time employment.   With approximately 700 mills per annum established,&#13;
an estimated 100,000-140,000 women are being displaced each year. On the&#13;
assumption that each woman works 50 days per annum, this means the loss is&#13;
5 million-7 million man-days of productive employment per annum, compared&#13;
to the estimated total employment in rice processing of 406 million man-&#13;
days.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
111.      In order to estimate the impact and implications of this labor&#13;
displacement, it is necessary to differentiate among three categories of&#13;
women involved. First, female members of large surplus farms, in general,&#13;
have benefitted from the change in technology. Although they did not&#13;
operate the dheki themselves, they had to supervise hired female labor who&#13;
did; in using the mill, they have more leisure time and their families have&#13;
benefitted economically by displacing dheki wage labor with cheaper milling&#13;
costs. Second, female members of subsistence farms who previously operated&#13;
the dheki benefit from the rice mill in the relief from time-consuming and&#13;
physically demanding labor. Their use of the mill, however, is restricted&#13;
by their ability to pay cash for milling costs and in some cases transpor-&#13;
tation costs. Third, wage-labor women from landless families who do dheki&#13;
work to augment family income and their families have suffered as a result&#13;
of technological change in the absence of alternative remunerative employ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
112.       In Bangladesh, most post-harvest operations, including dheki&#13;
work, are undertaken by family labor. But at least 10 percent of total&#13;
rice production is husked by hired landless women using the dheki, the&#13;
equivalent of approximately 20 million man-days of employment for the&#13;
poorest 5 percent of rural women. Recent studies indicate that this&#13;
employment accounts for about 55 percent of their annual income and&#13;
contributes as much as 15 percent to family income (Greeley, 1981, p. 26).&#13;
113.      A recent survey of farm families in the Tangail district found&#13;
that 33 percent had started to use rice mills and that 73 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
mill users had previously hired women using the dheki. Apparently, the&#13;
farmers most likely to use commercial mills are those who have been&#13;
employing labor for dheki work rather than those who have been relying on&#13;
"free" family labor. If this pattern is replicated on a country-wide&#13;
basis, employment opportunities in husking for landless women are being&#13;
eliminated annually at the rate of 3.6 million-5.1 million man-days.&#13;
114.      Rural hullers do create some jobs, although in mills providing&#13;
only husking/polishing services opportunity per mill is limited to two or&#13;
three permanent male employees who are paid a monthly salary. Many mills&#13;
also provide work for landless women who winnow the rice after husking.&#13;
These women are paid by the mill's customers for their work and a recent&#13;
study estimated that one woman could earn an average of Tk 3.5 per day (7&#13;
maunds per day at 50 paise per maund) (Ministry of Food, 1980). Some mills&#13;
with boiler attachments also create work for women in soaking, parboiling,&#13;
and drying activities. Recent surveys indicate that the poorest and most&#13;
destitute women, i.e., the ones most likely to be displaced from dheki&#13;
work, are also most likely to go to mill locations and seek other options&#13;
since, through necessity, they are less constrained by purdah than less&#13;
poverty-stricken females. However, the number of mill jobs created (about&#13;
20,000 permanent plus 40,000 part-time jobs) by no means compensates for&#13;
the jobs displaced. Although the productivity of women's,labor increases&#13;
almost two-fold in commercial processing, they do not receive extra income&#13;
commensurately. Thus, they are exploited to an even greater extent than in&#13;
traditional processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
115.      Another interesting phenomenon is that poor working women in many&#13;
parts of Tangail, Dhaka, Jamalpur, and Comilla districts are using the&#13;
mills to their benefit. The poorest women rarely own a dheki, since they&#13;
have neither the capital to invest in the equipment (now costing Tk&#13;
250-400) or the land on which to locate and operate it. If living near a&#13;
mill, however, they are now able to enter into the paddy-husking business&#13;
by buying paddy if they have the capital, parboiling and drying it, and&#13;
having it hulled at the local rice mill. In this way, they can process&#13;
three to four maunds of paddy a day, compared to only one maund a day with&#13;
a dheki. At current milling rates, and given the larger possible output,&#13;
the women are able to earn more per day than would be possible performing&#13;
dheki work for other people. They are also able to earn higher profits&#13;
than if setting up their own husking business with a dheki. The recent&#13;
Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies rural industry study found that&#13;
if labor costs are taken into account, husking businesses using only the&#13;
dheki are not profitable.20/ Under the circumstances, the trend towards&#13;
establishment of husking businesses using mills should be encouraged, since&#13;
it obviously results in landless women being able to take advantage of the&#13;
mechanical efficiency of the mills rather than being exploited by them.&#13;
Their ability to participate will, however, be dependent on their access to&#13;
credit to allow them to buy paddy. Many agencies such as Grameen Bank have&#13;
20/ The Ministry of Agriculture Task Force investigation also revealed&#13;
very low returns to women's paddy husking business using dheki (Tk 1.5&#13;
per day per woman). This was lower than their earnings on food-for-&#13;
work projects and one-third the average wage for unskilled male&#13;
laborers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
started providing credit facilities specifically to the landless, and&#13;
possibilities of expansion need to be explored.21/&#13;
116.      The Grameen Bank has also experimented with giving credit to a&#13;
group of 30 landless women to facilitate their joint ownership of a small&#13;
rice mill. These women all previously worked for other people in dheki&#13;
work and in other post-harvest activities. Obviously a more difficult&#13;
scheme than that of lending small amounts of credit to women for a paddy&#13;
husking business, it entails considerable training and monitoring as well&#13;
as organizational skill. This experiment is, however, very important.&#13;
First, if successful, it will prove that women are capable of operating a&#13;
mill themselves: normally, the milling process, although a woman's task&#13;
traditionally, is taken over by men when machines are introduced. Second,&#13;
the availability of a small female-owned and operated mill within a village&#13;
is likely to be of benefit to many women who will use it, rather than&#13;
having to wait for male members of the family to take grain to a mill&#13;
outside the village. Third, it will offer the maximum opportunity for&#13;
landless women to increase their earnings from a traditional occupation and&#13;
to retain processing incomes within the village economy. Preliminary&#13;
impressions are favorable and loans have, in fact, been given to three&#13;
other women's groups to purchase a rice husking mill. If these schemes&#13;
21/  Grameen Bank and other voluntary agencies have credit schemes which&#13;
are restricted to the poorest sections of society. In the case of&#13;
Grameen Bank, these are the landless--defined in terms of owning less&#13;
than 0.40 acres of land. Since this is the group most likely to have&#13;
been displaced by the introduction of mills and other mechanization in&#13;
rural areas, this is a useful way of developing alternative remunera-&#13;
tive employment opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
work successfully, they will obviously pave the way for similar schemes&#13;
(M. Rahman, 1980).&#13;
117.      The importance of such schemes that enable members of landless&#13;
families to benefit from technical change rather than be displaced by it&#13;
cannot be overemphasized. Without access to credit or productive&#13;
resources, the majority of displaced women has been unable to find equally&#13;
remunerative employment elsewhere; in most localities, alternatives for&#13;
displaced women are general domestic work at half the dheki rate,&#13;
unemployment, or begging. The organization of credit schemes to help women&#13;
to earn from paddy husking in conjunction with the mills or owning a rice&#13;
mill will obviously alleviate the situation. But given the scale of&#13;
displacement, there is a need to identify and promote even more ways of&#13;
creating new sources of employment and income.&#13;
118.      Automatic rice mills have a greater effect on the employment of&#13;
landless women than rural hullers do. Since these mills have a milling&#13;
capacity 345 times greater than that of the dheki and since they displace&#13;
labor not only in milling, but also in pre-milling activities, each mill&#13;
can theoretically eliminate over 1,000 part-time jobs for women. In&#13;
return, only approximately 30 jobs for skilled/semi-skilled male workers&#13;
are created at a capital cost of Tk 250,000 per job.&#13;
119.      Besides their negative impact on the employment of rural women,&#13;
automatic mills using scarce capital and foreign exchange resources have a&#13;
heavy cost to society. The same input of paddy could be handled by rural&#13;
hullers at 6-7 percent of the investment cost for an automatic rice mill&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
(see Table 9). Much of this additional spending on automatic mills is&#13;
moreover wasted on idle capacity. Breakdowns are frequent, and a plant can&#13;
be put out of action when spare parts are not available.&#13;
120.      Machinery for automatic mills is imported, whereas that for rural&#13;
processing (e.g. hullers, belts, soaking, parboiling and winnowing&#13;
equipment) is made locally, thus creating employment and income for local&#13;
firms and artisans (including landless women). Paddy has to be transported&#13;
over long distances to supply large automatic mills and facilities must be&#13;
constructed for storage. Automatic mills completely remove by-products as&#13;
a valuable source of fuel and animal feed; with rural processing, the&#13;
by-products are retained at the village level.&#13;
121.      The more easily quantifiable characteristics of the rural mill&#13;
and the automatic mill are compared in Table 9.&#13;

b/ This calculation does not allow for the effect of differences in prices&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Although the automatic mill can be expected to give a higher recovery of&#13;
rice, the rural huller has a much higher productivity of capital (measured&#13;
in terms of value added per unit of capital invested), has a lower cost per&#13;
workplace, and uses far less capital and foreign exchange. Also, storage&#13;
and transportation costs involved with the rural huller and susceptibility&#13;
to breakdowns are lower and ease of operation, maintenance, and repair is&#13;
greater. In addition, the rural huller has the advantage of being able to&#13;
handle large numbers of small batches of paddy and, being small-scale, can&#13;
provide services close to where people live.&#13;
122.      Due to these advantages of the rural huller over the automatic&#13;
rice mills and its advantage over dheki milling, it would seem imperative&#13;
to devote resources to overcoming the huller's existing defects with&#13;
respect to quantity and quality of output. As yet, no one has taken a&#13;
serious look at the possibilities of reducing the apparent food losses&#13;
involved in using a steel huller or at ways of decreasing breakages and&#13;
separating out good quality bran. Yet such research could be carried out&#13;
at a fraction of the cost of the resources invested in automatic rice&#13;
mills.&#13;
123.      The benefits of technological research on rural hullers would be:&#13;
food losses resulting from the use of 10,000 rural hullers would be&#13;
reduced; possibilities would exist for creating employment and import&#13;
substitution through small-scale processing of oil from rice bran; and the&#13;
need to import costly automated plants would be reduced.&#13;

Other Rice Processing Operations&#13;
124.      Food losses can occur in any of the 11 post-harvest activities,&#13;
not only in husking/polishing. Without the use of improved technology,&#13;
food losses during processing can be quite high in the market surplus/&#13;
commercial sector; at farm level, they are much lower. The technology&#13;
used in activities such as threshing and drying will affect milling&#13;
efficiency (irrespective of the milling technology used). For example,&#13;
inadequately dried paddy increases the amount of rice broken during&#13;
milling.&#13;
125.      Proposals for more capital-intensive technologies in post-harvest&#13;
operations are typically based on the argument that food losses from&#13;
existing technologies are as high as 40 percent. Published estimates of&#13;
farm-level losses vary by source: 20-25 percent cited by voluntary&#13;
organizations, 35 percent by leading manufacturers of modern rice&#13;
processing equipment; and 20-40 percent by scientists in international&#13;
donor agencies. Losses of 20 percent in the commercial sector are not&#13;
uncommon. Figures commonly quoted for farm-level losses are estimates&#13;
rather than based on physical measurement. By contrast, recent research&#13;
aimed specifically at providing reliable estimation of food loss in&#13;
village-level processing of grain retained for home consumption indicates&#13;
that average physical weight loss is less than 7 percent. The loss&#13;
estimated in each operation is shown in Table 10.&#13;

126.      The absence of drying from this table is of some interest, given&#13;
the resources that have been allocated by several institutes in Bangladesh&#13;
towards developing an improved crop dryer for use by small farmers. Such&#13;
work has been prompted by the assumption that losses occur as a result of&#13;
reliance on sun-drying and that small farmers would therefore find it&#13;
economically worthwhile to invest in a dryer or pay for custom drying&#13;
services. An analysis carried out to assess the cost effectiveness of a&#13;
small paddy dryer provides a cost-benefit ratio of 1:1.7, based on an&#13;
assumed (not estimated) loss of 3 maunds for every 40 maunds of paddy sun&#13;
dried (i.e., a loss of 7.5 percent) (M. Rahman, 1980). Obviously, if&#13;
losses are negligible, there would be little incentive for a farmer to&#13;
substitute essentially free family labor with an expensive dryer. Indeed,&#13;
small farmers in Bangladesh have shown very little interest in improved&#13;
drying techniques.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
127.      Given the low and diverse nature of food losses on small farms,&#13;
based on experience with small paddy dryers, there would seem to be little&#13;
future in or justification for devoting resources to developing&#13;
technologies aimed specifically at reducing them, especially if this&#13;
diverts attention and resources from more realistic ways of reducing&#13;
hunger.&#13;
128.      As seen in the case of rice milling, technological change also&#13;
occurred in threshing for reasons of reducing cost rather than food&#13;
losses. At a cost of Tk 1,000, a pedal thresher allows a farmer to thresh&#13;
his crop with one operator instead of five casual laborers.     This results&#13;
in a saving of approximately Tk 70 per ton of paddy threshed. For a 3-acre&#13;
farm with an assumed yield of 14.6 maunds per acre and two crops per annum,&#13;
the resultant saving is Tk 210 per annum. As seen is Table 11, however,&#13;
the thresher, like the rural mill, can increase rather than reduce food&#13;
losses; even so, it is a worthwhile investment for medium-size and large&#13;
farms. But as with the mills, the technological change is occurring at the&#13;
expense of the workers displaced, usually casual laborers from landless&#13;
families.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
129.      The implications seem clear.   Resources currently devoted to&#13;
researching ways of improving small-farm crop-processing technologies are&#13;
unlikely to yield significant reduction in food losses, and would be better&#13;
used to assist those who are being displaced by technological changes.&#13;
They might assist groups of landless women to gain access to mills and&#13;
threshers so that they can benefit from, rather than be displaced by, such&#13;
changes; they might also be used to promote research and development of&#13;
technologies that create new rural employment opportunities for women&#13;
through the processing of underutilized resources, such as processing oil&#13;
from rice bran in the village.&#13;
130.      In Bangladesh, where market surpluses come from millions of&#13;
relatively small holdings and where government is committed to a&#13;
procurement scheme which handles increasing quantities of grain, the&#13;
problems of collection, transportation, storage, and processing are&#13;
enormous.&#13;
131.      Alternative solutions, some institutional and some technical, to&#13;
dealing with marketed surpluses do exist. On the institutional side, the&#13;
problem of drying large quantities of centrally collected wet paddy could&#13;
be averted if incentives were increased to provide ready-processed rice&#13;
through the government procurement system. Smaller quantities of paddy&#13;
could be dried using less capital-intensive techniques and also provide&#13;
more work in rural areas. Technical measures to help non-modernized mills&#13;
cope more efficiently with large batches of paddy are needed. Improved&#13;
technologies for increased efficiency of soaking and parboiling operations&#13;
could also be investigated; for example, the technology developed at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Karikpur Rice Processing Center in India combines the soaking and parboil-&#13;
ing system in one process and reduces the time taken from 48 hours to 5&#13;
hours.&#13;
132.      Technical improvements and institutional incentives to use&#13;
existing processing facilities make better sense than spending large&#13;
amounts of foreign exchange on imported plants. Resources used on the&#13;
importation of high-cost technology would in the long term be more cost-&#13;
effective if spent on improving technologies or developing new ones more&#13;
suited to prevailing conditions in Bangladesh.&#13;
C. Technology and Employment in the Processing&#13;
of Other Crops and Other Rural Activities&#13;
133.      Substantial displacement of landless women, due to mechanization&#13;
in rice processing will continue to take place in the near future. In&#13;
order to maintain the level of rural incomes and thus the level of demand&#13;
for food (poor households spend 80 percent of their income on food,&#13;
compared to 62 percent in richer households), it is important to find ways&#13;
and means of productively reabsorbing those being displaced by mechaniza-&#13;
tion (Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), 1981, p. 337).&#13;
Through the organization of credit schemes that enable landless women to&#13;
take advantage of those technologies which are already being diffused&#13;
(mainly rice mills and paddy threshers), the problem could be partially&#13;
solved. There is need to expand the outreach of these schemes. However,&#13;
increased employment opportunities for women outside of rice processing are&#13;
also needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Processing of Crops Other than Paddy&#13;
134.      The processing of crops other than paddy--jute, wheat, sugarcane,&#13;
oilseeds, silk, fruits, vegetables and nuts--represents a significant&#13;
actual and potential source of employment for landless women in rural&#13;
areas. It is an important area in which to seek alternative employment for&#13;
those women displaced by rice-processing technology as well as a potential&#13;
expansion in rural employment opportunities. The Second Five-Year Plan&#13;
proposed that acreage and output of many crops should be expanded because&#13;
of their importance in terms of import substitution, export earnings, high&#13;
demand for labor, and provision of inputs to important labor-intensive&#13;
cottage industries such as food processing.&#13;
135.      As with paddy, the processing of most other crops in Bangladesh&#13;
is undertaken with the use of low-cost traditional technologies that are&#13;
characterized by high levels of labor input and low levels of return to&#13;
labor. Improved technologies will obviously play an important part in&#13;
overcoming constraints on processing higher levels of output; however, this&#13;
in no way implies that large-scale imported technologies will be required:&#13;
Indeed, the experience with rice processing suggests that large-scale&#13;
technologies for processing crops grown predominantly on scattered small&#13;
holdings can be counterproductive and can waste resources.&#13;
Jute&#13;
136.      After rice, jute is the most important crop in terms of providing&#13;
employment in processing activities. Of an estimated 105 man-days per acre&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
involved in jute production, approximately 30-40 percent are used in&#13;
processing activities (retting, stripping, washing, drying and bundling).&#13;
Most of this work is done by female family members with the help of hired&#13;
female workers. In FY81, this provided an estimated 45-55 million days of&#13;
work for women, of which 15-18 million days were for hired female labor&#13;
(mainly from landless families).&#13;
137.      About 40 percent of the annual jute crop tends to be of low&#13;
quality due, according to studies by the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute&#13;
(BJRI), to inadequate retting and washing facilities and improper retting&#13;
practices, prompting a search for improved technological solutions&#13;
(Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, 1980/81). A commercial decorticating&#13;
or ribboning machine was located and imported to test technical feasibility&#13;
and economic viability, but was found to be unsuitable because of the cost&#13;
in relation to jute farmers' income. Its use also resulted in broken jute&#13;
sticks, thus eliminating the sale of whole sticks for fencing and building&#13;
purposes as an important source of income22!. The Institute attempted to&#13;
identify a technology more appropriate to local needs, means, and&#13;
circumstances, and developed a low-cost "intermediate" technology that&#13;
reduces retting time from 12 days to 8 days, allows double the quantity of&#13;
fiber to be retted in a given quantity of water, and improves the quality&#13;
22/ Jute sticks are available at the rate of 2 maunds for each maund of&#13;
fiber. The sticks are also an important source of fuel, often&#13;
fetching a price similar to low-grade firewood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
of fiber extracted from the hard base of the jute plant.23/ This new&#13;
technique is now being demonstrated in 500 locations in Bangladesh with a&#13;
view to proving its technical and economic feasibility. If adopted by&#13;
farming families on a widespread basis, it provides the opportunity for&#13;
increasing employment and incomes and eliminates the need for imports.24/&#13;
The new technique is being demonstrated by men, whereas it is women (to&#13;
whom they have no direct access) who are responsible for the retting/&#13;
washing processes. This could well impede adoption of a process/device&#13;
which is seen as being women's work. Thought should be given to the&#13;
possibilities of utilizing more female extension workers. A recent&#13;
estimate suggests that some 10 million work-days of employment could be&#13;
created by the universal adoption of the ribboner. Much of this would be&#13;
family labor, but a sizeable portion could be for hired female laborers if&#13;
they are given appropriate training related to the new technology.&#13;
Wheat&#13;
138.      The introduction of a new crop can often result in the need for&#13;
new technologies in the processing sector. One example in Bangladesh is&#13;
the introduction of wheat which, because it is harder to thresh than paddy,&#13;
has resulted in post-harvest bottleneck on 2-3 acre farms and stimulated a&#13;
demand for an improved threshing technology.&#13;
23/ With traditional techniques, this low-quality fiber fetches only 33&#13;
percent of normal price. The ribboning process consists of the&#13;
removal of the hard base and core of the plant and the splitting of&#13;
the remaining, usable fibrous mass into slender ribbons in order to&#13;
aid rapid water penetration during the retting process. The&#13;
"intermediate" technology ribboner involves the use of a few simple&#13;
bamboo hooks, each costing a few taka. Although the ribboning&#13;
operation has been claimed to reduce fiber quality, the consequent&#13;
gains at the retting stage almost certainly offset these effects.&#13;
24/ See footnote 2, page 17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
139.      A review of existing technologies by the Bangladesh Rural&#13;
Advancement Committee revealed that the smallest available commercial&#13;
thresher, imported, with an output of 250 kg/hr, was too expensive and too&#13;
big for the farmers requesting assistance and that the locally manufactured&#13;
paddy thresher was no more efficient in threshing wheat than the&#13;
traditional beating technique. Attempts are underway to develop a small&#13;
manually operated machine which, however, would probably be out of the&#13;
price range of small farmers and would be used mainly by larger farmers to&#13;
overcome labor bottlenecks and save labor costs. Any employment created&#13;
for groups of landless women would be in performing custom services.&#13;
Sugar/Gur&#13;
140.      According to BSCIC's 1981 survey on cottage industries, there are&#13;
17,881 units for making gur (unrefined sugar) in Bangladesh, employing&#13;
63,665 persons of which 25 percent are hired laborers (Kanwal, 1982). Gur&#13;
technology, as used throughout Bangladesh, has remained unchanged for many&#13;
years. The juice is extracted by three-roller vertical traditional&#13;
crushers driven by bullock power; it is then boiled in open pans using&#13;
bagasse and paddy straw as fuel; and finally, the thick juice is poured&#13;
into earthenware pots and allowed to form gur. Women are predominant in&#13;
the latter two activities. Crushers, pans, and accessories (Tk 35,000&#13;
total cost) are rented by farmers for the season at a cost of Tk 75 per&#13;
month (Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), 1981).&#13;
141.      This relatively labor-intensive cottage industry exists side by&#13;
side with a modern capital-intensive sugar industry that produces white&#13;
plantation sugar in 15 factories. Although they produce two different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
products (catering to different markets), the two industries compete with&#13;
each other for raw material (at least for the 35 percent of sugarcane&#13;
acreage that is within the so-called "mill" zones).&#13;
142.      From the standpoint of employment and nutrition, the gur industry&#13;
is preferable to the modern sugar industry. However, as seen in Table 12,&#13;
it is less efficient in productive terms.&#13;

143.      Both the Institute of Appropriate Technology (on behalf of the&#13;
Government's Planning Commission) and BSCIC are investigating ways of&#13;
improving gur-making technology. Planned improvements in the BSCIC program&#13;
include: cutting and shredding of cane prior to crushing, necessitating&#13;
the use of a horizontal roller rather than a vertical roller, but&#13;
increasing yield by 10 percent; introduction of flat bottom pans;&#13;
demonstration of and training in the use of improved furnaces; use of&#13;
better clarifying agents derived from local plants; and introduction of&#13;
airtight storage bins and cellophane wrapping. BSCIC's extension channels&#13;
would be used to deliver credit to producers for purchase of equipment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
to demonstrate new techniques. Most BSCIC extension agents are men who may&#13;
not have direct access to the women who are largely responsible for the&#13;
boiling and storing operations.&#13;
144.       Several landless groups (some of them women's groups) are engaged&#13;
in gur manufacture with the help of loans from agencies such as BRAC. The&#13;
BRAC groups typically consist of 30 women or 30 men who farm a total of 16&#13;
acres on a 50:50 basis with a local farmer. The sharecropper group&#13;
provides all labor and the farmer pays them 50 percent of the labor cost,&#13;
that is, the labor in his half of the field. In addition, the farmer pays&#13;
for half the cost of plants, fertilizer, and other inputs. Production in&#13;
the form of gur is divided equally between the group and the farmer. In&#13;
addition, the wages earned by the group in preparing half of the field for&#13;
the farmer are charged at normal agricultural rates (Tk 15-20 per day for&#13;
men; Tk 8-10 per day for women).&#13;
145.      Important intermediate technologies for consideration are evident&#13;
in the "mini" sugar plants now widely used in India providing a great deal&#13;
of employment for unskilled women who sun-dry the bagasse which is then&#13;
used for fuel. Khandsari, the sugar produced, costs more per unit than&#13;
gur, but unlike gur, it is an acceptable substitute for white plantation&#13;
sugar since it contains 94-98 percent sucrose. The advantages of "mini"&#13;
plants versus large-scale plants can be seen in Table 13, using data from&#13;
India.&#13;

146.      Mini sugar units now crush 10 percent of total sugarcane grown in&#13;
India and the technology has been successfully transferred to other&#13;
countries, such as Kenya. They should be considered as an alternative to&#13;
large mills in any planned expansion of milling capacity in Bangladesh,&#13;
especially since the large mills are reportedly facing problems in terms of&#13;
organization/management and transport of raw materials. Transporting&#13;
sugarcane over long distances to a centralized mill is not only expensive&#13;
in terms of fuel costs, but also incurs losses in production due to sucrose&#13;
depletion if the time between cutting and crushing exceeds 48 hours. Mini&#13;
mills serving a smaller radius overcome these problems.&#13;
Oilseeds&#13;
147.      Many landless families in rural areas derive employment and&#13;
income from purchasing oil seeds (normally rape and mustard) and selling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
the oil, which they extract with a traditional ghani driven by a bullock or&#13;
in some cases by female labor. They also perform custom services for small&#13;
farmers. Oil pressing is estimated to provide employment for some&#13;
21,000-27,000 people of whom approximately 35 percent are women.&#13;
148.      In a situation where 3 percent of rural incomes are spent on&#13;
edible oil and where only 28 percent of demand is met by domestic produc-&#13;
tion, there is enormous scope for expansion in oil pressing as a cottage&#13;
industry, thus saving on imports of oil and oilseeds and creating rural&#13;
employment. Here, too, choice of technology will have a bearing on output,&#13;
employment, income distribution, and foreign exchange costs. Opting for&#13;
large oil mill complexes and solvent extraction plants involves large&#13;
amounts of foreign exchange (such plants cost several million Taka, of&#13;
which 50-60 percent are foreign exchange). Also, supplying these large&#13;
capacity plants with raw materials from widely dispersed small holdings&#13;
presents enormous administrative problems and involves high transportation&#13;
costs for collection of seeds and distribution of oil. A large plant&#13;
utilizing imported seeds might be feasible to supply a large urban market&#13;
such as Dhaka, but small-scale, village-level processing facilities using&#13;
locally available raw materials should be more cost-effective in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;

149.      The milling efficiency of traditional techniques is low and an&#13;
expanded decentralized oil processing industry will need to be based on&#13;
some improvement in technology. According to recent reports, it is&#13;
doubtful whether much can be done technically to increase the efficiency&#13;
of the bullock ghani, due to the mechanical limitations of its design and&#13;
construction. However, as seen in Table 14, an "intermediate" technology,&#13;
the rural oil mill, increases labor productivity and decreases processing&#13;
costs, while maintaining a relatively low cost per workplace.&#13;
150.      Mechanized rural oil mills have been spreading fairly rapidly in&#13;
the past 10 years, especially in areas benefitting from local electrifica-&#13;
tion schemes. They are used in cottage and small-scale industry settings,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
and are generally owned by local entrepreneurs. Two types of technology&#13;
are used. One consists of a mechanized version of the traditional ghani,&#13;
embodying pestle-and-mortar units, usually arranged in contra-rotating&#13;
pairs, in which (unlike the bullock ghani) the pestles are held stationary&#13;
while the mortars are rotated around them, normally by means of a belt&#13;
drive powered by an electricity-driven line shaft. The number of pairs of&#13;
mechanical ghani installed in a typical plant averages around 7-8, but the&#13;
range is large (2-15 pairs), although in exceptional cases, more are&#13;
installed. The pestle and mortar units are of a more efficient design that&#13;
those used in the bullock ghani. However, their efficiency (about 35&#13;
percent) is still not equal to the more modern screw expeller.&#13;
151.      This second technology consists basically of an enclosed&#13;
horizontal rotating metal screw that causes the oilseeds to be subjected to&#13;
great pressure, thereby causing the oil cells to be ruptured and the oil&#13;
separated from the oilcake. It forms the basis of the majority of modern&#13;
oilseed processing plants. Screw expellers exist in a wide range of&#13;
capacities, from a few kilograms to several tons per hour. In the rural&#13;
mechanized mills of Bangladesh, the screw expellers used are generally of&#13;
small, or very small, capacity. An increasing number of rural mills are&#13;
based solely on expeller technology, but the majority of rural mills&#13;
consist of a battery of mechanical ghani supplemented by screw expellers.&#13;
The usual practice is for the raw materials to be processed in the ghani,&#13;
the resulting oilcake then being conveyed to the expeller unit or units,&#13;
through which it is generally passed several times. Some pungency is&#13;
maintained through using the ghani, but oil yield is increased by about 38&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
152.      Mechanical ghani yield oil of lower pungency than that obtainable&#13;
from bullock ghani, but higher than that obtainable from a screw expeller.&#13;
Although the importance of the pungency in mustard oil is a declining&#13;
factor in rural tastes, its continuing influence is a major reason for the&#13;
continuing popularity of the mechanical ghani technology vis-a-vis&#13;
expellers.&#13;
153.      The number of mechanized rural mills of all types, whether&#13;
combining ghani and expeller technology or operating on expeller technology&#13;
alone, is estimated to be currently between 750 and 1,200 and to be&#13;
increasing with the spread of rural electrification.&#13;
154.      As power supplies reach villages, the powered ghani has tended to&#13;
replace the bullock ghani. According to recent estimates, the number of&#13;
bullock ghani decreased from 25,060 in 1961 to 7,989 in 1980, with a&#13;
corresponding fall in numbers employed in oil processing from 65,280 to&#13;
21,130. Of these jobs, approximately 35 percent were held by women, of&#13;
whom three-quarters belong to households which are officially classified as&#13;
landless (Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS)). Some new&#13;
jobs, mainly for men, have been created in the mechanized rural oil mills,&#13;
thus, doing little to counteract the displacement of landless women through&#13;
mechanization.&#13;
155.      The situation regarding mechanization of oil processing is&#13;
similar to rice milling and undoubtedly deserves comparable examination.&#13;
In particular, there seems to be a case for supporting rural mechanized&#13;
mills versus large modern factories. Upon further assessment of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
employment impact of various oil milling technologies in Bangladesh, there&#13;
may be employment potential for rural women to extract oil from seeds that&#13;
are not being processed. Women's hold on the oil milling industry might be&#13;
maintained through provision of loans to women's groups to establish rural&#13;
oil mills.&#13;
Sericulture and Ericulture&#13;
156.      Silk production (breeding, reeling, spinning and weaving) is&#13;
still minor in its contribution to domestic product in Bangladesh, but it&#13;
provides employment to large numbers of rural women (many of them&#13;
landless), and income to their families. Two kinds of silk are produced:&#13;
mulberry silk (sericulture) and endi (ericulture), the latter being fed the&#13;
leaves of castor or cassava which grow easily all over Bangladesh. Silk&#13;
production is highly labor-intensive, and requires little capital outlay.&#13;
The Second Five-Year Plan had ambitious targets for the expansion of both&#13;
in order to provide income opportunities for the families of marginal&#13;
farmers and the landless.&#13;
157.      Available statistics indicate that the number of persons employed&#13;
in sericulture, in all processes, rose from 18,000 in 1977/8 to 60,000 in&#13;
1981/2, and that the number should increase to 350,000 by the end of the&#13;
Plan period. The allocation of employment is 77 percent for cultivation&#13;
and rearing, 4 percent for reeling, and 13 percent for weaving. The&#13;
participation of women in sericulture has been well recognized. Similar&#13;
figures are not available for ericulture which is being promoted as a bari-&#13;
based cottage industry, especially for women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
158.      Unfortunately, although more labor-intensive, employment&#13;
opportunities for villages in the endi-silk industry are limited, since an&#13;
appreciable amount of the spinning and weaving is done outside the&#13;
village. As raw material it is difficult to weave and frequently has to be&#13;
combined with cotton, the silk providing the weft while the stronger cotton&#13;
constitutes the warp. Technical means of overcoming this constraint are&#13;
urgently needed if the potential of the industry in creating jobs for&#13;
landless women is to be realized.&#13;
159.      If the full employment potential of the industry is to be&#13;
realized, more study of the alternatives for its development is needed.&#13;
For example, sericulture entails the development of small industry, as&#13;
opposed to bari-based or cottage-based industries, and requires more&#13;
capital investment. Ericulture emphasizes bari-based production, builds on&#13;
existing skill and expertise, and can employ women in any of the production&#13;
stages. With mulberry silk, there are limited possibilities for developing&#13;
associated industries. With ericulture, however, cottage industries can be&#13;
developed to utilize the cassava and castor plants on which the cocoons are&#13;
reared. Starch can be manufactured from cassava tubers (or they can be&#13;
used as a substitute for rice) and oil can be extracted from the castor&#13;
seeds for use as an industrial lubricant. Research is also being conducted&#13;
on the possibility of extracting oil from the cocoon wastes for use as a&#13;
lubricating oil or as an input to soap making. All of these processing&#13;
activities which could provide much needed jobs for rural women with&#13;
appropriate small-scale technologies should obviously be encouraged, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
should schemes to provide rural women with the credit and training needed&#13;
to take advantage of them.25/&#13;
Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts&#13;
160.      Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are grown in small holdings&#13;
throughout Bangladesh, but the potential of processing them with a view to&#13;
substituting for imports, expanding exports, and generating employment in&#13;
rural areas is largely unexplored.&#13;
161.      Generally, it is assumed that the high quality of foodstuffs&#13;
needed for import substitution and/or export dictates the use of high-cost&#13;
capital-intensive equipment. The Second Five-Year Plan recommends the&#13;
establishment of two large fruit and vegetable processing and canning&#13;
units. However, due to the need to create rural employment, the use of&#13;
more labor-intensive technologies requiring less foreign exchange and lower&#13;
energy costs should also be investigated. Evidence from several countries&#13;
indicates that small-scale food-processing technologies can provide very&#13;
high standard products.26/&#13;
162.      In Bangladesh, a Mennonite Central Committee pilot project has&#13;
demonstrated that dessicated coconut produced by rural women with a minimum&#13;
25/ For details see S. Feldman, 1982.&#13;
26/ For example, highly labor intensive methods of production are&#13;
successfully used in the processing of export crops such as cashew&#13;
nuts in India; in parts of East Africa mangoes are processed using&#13;
solar energy for commercial markets. UNIDO, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
of capital equipment can attract markets in Dhaka and replace imported&#13;
Malaysian coconut powder. Experiments carried out by other agencies have&#13;
shown that spices ground manually by women's groups can compete quality-&#13;
wise with commercially produced spices. Investigations are underway to&#13;
locate a hand-operated grinding machine that would increase capacity, lower&#13;
costs, and increase profits. Again, if resources were available by way of&#13;
credit for landless women, the replication of these schemes, based on&#13;
improved technologies, could create many needed jobs.&#13;
163.      Another possibility is a small, mobile, fruit juice and&#13;
concentrate manufacturing unit that could be moved from village to&#13;
village. Fruit would be purchased and processed on the spot with the&#13;
assistance of locally-hired female labor. The pulp could then be&#13;
transported (by country boat) to collection centers and stored (with the&#13;
help of preservatives) for eventual further processing into juices or&#13;
concentrates for canning and sale locally or overseas. A similar scheme&#13;
involving the processing of oranges worked well in St. Vincent. Obviously&#13;
more employment could be created in areas growing several fruits, each&#13;
ripening at different times.&#13;
164.      A constraint on the development of a fruit and vegetable&#13;
processing industry in many countries is the scarcity and cost of glass&#13;
containers. In the case of dehydrated coconuts, for example, polythene&#13;
bags can be used. Rigid plastic containers are now replacing glass&#13;
containers in many countries and their efficient small-scale rural&#13;
production has proved possible in neighboring South Asian countries. In&#13;
Sri Lanka, for example, plastic containers are produced for the equivalent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
of 0.6 Tk each, whereas comparable glass jars cost six to seven times as&#13;
much. Possibilities of creating employment for rural landless women&#13;
producing similar plastic containers in Bangladesh should be investigated.&#13;
Technology and Employment in Other Rural Activities&#13;
165.      Identifying, developing, and disseminating appropriate&#13;
technological options are just as important in other industries as in&#13;
agroprocessing. The socio-economic costs and employment implications of&#13;
imported production processes for centralized, capital-intensive production&#13;
needs to be examined carefully. In parallel, resources should be invested&#13;
in locating or developing economically viable, intermediate alternatives.&#13;
166.      Research aimed at developing appropriate agroprocessing&#13;
technologies is, as seen, far from adequate. In sectors other than&#13;
agriculture, such research is scant. As in agroprocessing, the amount of&#13;
resources devoted to importing capital-intensive plants and equipment is&#13;
vast, while the amount devoted to developing and producing technologies&#13;
aimed specifically at increasing employment (or minimizing labor&#13;
displacement) as well as increasing output, improving quality, and saving&#13;
foreign exchange is negligible.&#13;
167.      There are many products other than food that are needed and used&#13;
regularly by local communities and purchased from urban manufacturing&#13;
centers or from abroad. If appropriate technologies (along with training&#13;
and credit) were made available to landless women, they could find&#13;
productive employment in the village-level production of many of these&#13;
commodities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
168.      A major category of products is the tools and accessories needed&#13;
in agricultural/agroprocessing activities (e.g., baskets for winnowing,&#13;
earthenware pots for parboiling paddy and processing gur, floors for drying&#13;
paddy), that traditionally are made by women. Women should continue to&#13;
find employment in the production of new and improved agricultural&#13;
implements and household equipment, including stoves, jute ribboners,&#13;
various types of packaging, and fishing nets.&#13;
169.      A second major category worthy of investigation is textiles.    As&#13;
mentioned, village-level employment for landless women in silk production&#13;
has potential. Technological improvements in the weaving of cotton&#13;
(largely imported) and jute would assist women to produce competitively.&#13;
Several agencies, such as HEED, BRAC, Save the Children, and Micro&#13;
Industries Development Assistance Society (MIDAS), are involved in projects&#13;
aimed at increasing the earnings of village women from textile production&#13;
by making credit available for equipment and supplies, training, and&#13;
technical assistance with design and marketing. Successful projects need&#13;
to be identified with a view to widespread replication.&#13;
170.      A third category of product demanded in rural communities is&#13;
building materials for housing and storage. The Bangladesh-Swiss&#13;
agricultural project involved a new technology requiring minimal capital&#13;
for labor-intensive production of low-cost, jute-fiber reinforced roofing&#13;
sheets, as a locally made alternative to expensive, imported galvanized&#13;
iron roofing sheets. The project produces roofing sheets for the agency's&#13;
warehouses and provides full-time employment for four workers who were&#13;
trained on the job. Gonashasthya Kendra (GK) is training production teams&#13;
of men and women to make vending boxes and other articles from similar&#13;
material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
171.      Finally, there are many everyday goods which, given the&#13;
appropriate technology, lend themselves to village-level production--&#13;
handmade paper, ropes, soap, pencils, chalk, and umbrellas. Several&#13;
agencies including the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) and BRAC are&#13;
experimenting with the introduction of improved technologies and necessary&#13;
support packages to enable groups of landless women to produce these and&#13;
other goods.&#13;
172.      For example, MCC has a pilot project involving a group of&#13;
landless women in the production of reem soap, which is being marketed in&#13;
local health centers for treatment of skin ailments. BRAC is exploring&#13;
the possible franchising of rural production of commodities such as soap,&#13;
umbrellas, and pencils. The system would be advantageous where raw&#13;
materials are scarce, where some parts of the product need to be&#13;
manufactured in capital-intensive plants, or where quality control/brand&#13;
name is essential to marketing. For soap, BRAC would be able to obtain&#13;
access to imported raw materials and obtain discounts on bulk purchase. In&#13;
the case of umbrellas and pencils, it could bulk purchase those parts&#13;
(spokes and lead) not manufactured at the village level and distribute&#13;
them to franchise-holders for finishing.&#13;
173.      The backward linkages (agro-inputs) and forward linkages (crop&#13;
and food processing equipment, consumer goods) to rising agricultural&#13;
production and farm incomes provide new opportunities in the rural areas&#13;
for job creation. For landless women these could include small-scale&#13;
manufacture of a wide range of goods, provided that this opportunity is not&#13;
preempted by the import of capital-intensive technology. Landless women's&#13;
groups would need assistance by way of training, credit, and improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
technologies to meet increased demand. The implementation for such rural&#13;
employment and income-generating programs for women requires, in addition&#13;
to policy commitment from the Government, direct assistance, such as&#13;
idet.tifying investment opportunities, organizing production groups, and&#13;
ensuring their access to technical and financial support.&#13;
PART III: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
174.      In Bangladesh, as in many other countries, the process of&#13;
modernization has had an adverse impact on the employment opportunities of&#13;
rural women, especially those from the poorest sections of society. In&#13;
particular, the spread of mechanization in the crop and food processing&#13;
subsector is displacing off-farm employment opportunities that provide much&#13;
needed income to landless women and their families. Although newer crop&#13;
processing businesses have replaced the old, they employ fewer people,&#13;
labor productivity and thus wages are higher, but the beneficiaries are&#13;
inevitably men. Experiments are being made to involve women in alternative&#13;
productive ventures based on new techniques, but they are a handful of&#13;
scattered projects. As yet, there are no new women's industries to provide&#13;
alternative employment opportunities on the scale required.&#13;
175.      Although difficult to argue against the introduction of some&#13;
degree of mechanization, the Bangladesh case demonstrates how to go about&#13;
planning a strategy for technological change that allows the best possible&#13;
end result in terms of women's employment. In particular, it shows how&#13;
sound economic arguments can be made against unnecessarily labor-displacing&#13;
technologies (automatic rice mills); how schemes can be devised to enable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
women to benefit from, rather than be exploited by, new technologies (rural&#13;
rice mills); how the need to upgrade traditional technologies utilized by&#13;
women can be identified and highlighted; and how projects aimed at creating&#13;
alternative employment opportunities for displaced women can be planned and&#13;
implemented. It also shows how difficult it is to get beyond the pilot&#13;
project and to diffuse widely the ideas, techniques, and technologies that&#13;
can form the basis of thousands rather than tens of jobs.&#13;
A. Data Base&#13;
176.      Various elements of information about women are required for&#13;
developing policies and planning effectively both to promote new oppor-&#13;
tunities for women's employment, and also to avoid displacing existing&#13;
ones. An important part of this data base is definition of the socio-&#13;
economic environment in which those policies and plans operate. In&#13;
Bangladesh, women's socialization and attitudes, their health, nutrition&#13;
and capacity to work, their knowledge and skill base, and their spatial&#13;
mobility are affected by the limitations which society and the prevailing&#13;
ideology of status place on women. These limitations affect the produc-&#13;
tivity of women's ongoing economic activities and the supply of female&#13;
labor for new ones. Since they will influence the ability of women to&#13;
utilize new opportunities, these limitations must be accommodated in&#13;
designing employment and income-generating activities.&#13;
177.      In Bangladesh, the groups identified as most in need of employ-&#13;
ment are women among the growing class of landless or functionally landless&#13;
households, and households headed by women. As landlessness increases,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
more and more families become dependent on nonfarm employment and, to&#13;
survive, need the earnings of several family members, including women.&#13;
Since the problem of increasing poverty and unemployment is widespread&#13;
throughout the country, a carefully designed stategy implemented over&#13;
different time horizons is needed to address it. The data on women would&#13;
suggest areas of the country to be given priority in allocating resources&#13;
for projects. Selectivity in the timing and location of projects would&#13;
also depend on various linkages in the economy, and regional development&#13;
strategies, as well as on institutional framework, availability of female&#13;
development agents and/or facilities for training them, and the experience&#13;
relevant to location and activity gained from previous pilot efforts.&#13;
178.      The data base would need to describe the work that women do.    In&#13;
this context, work would include those activities usually regarded as&#13;
domestic work and accorded no economic value, even though as in the case of&#13;
rice processing at the household level, it clearly adds value. Women will&#13;
be expected to continue performing these tasks whether or not income-&#13;
earning possibilities are created, but it is necessary to include them in&#13;
the analysis, since they preempt a certain amount of women's time and&#13;
energy; the efficiency of the tasks might be improved, and they may suggest&#13;
some income-earning trade-off. Another element of women's work would be&#13;
their own-account efforts to earn income through agriculture-related&#13;
activities such as raising small animals, vegetable growing, making spices&#13;
and vegetable-based handicrafts. For these, the employment strategy would&#13;
propose ways to improve their technical efficiency and organization,&#13;
marketing, availability of tools and credit, as well as proposing new&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
179.      The third element of women's work would be those activities for&#13;
which wages (cash and/or in-kind) are paid. The major off-farm sources&#13;
with potential for expansion and/or better conditions for women appear to&#13;
be in small factories, processing agricultural products and manufacturing&#13;
articles for local consumption, including those linked to agro-processing,&#13;
and the food-for-work schemes. Recent innovations in the food-for-work&#13;
schemes, such as to provide year-round employment for women for a cash wage&#13;
to do road maintenance, suggest that there may be options in this program&#13;
that have not yet been explored. Further, there would be opportunities for&#13;
wage employment for female development agents of different levels,&#13;
including trainers, extension workers, and group promoters who would be&#13;
needed to implement the employment strategy.&#13;
B. Current Employment Situation/Trends&#13;
180.      In the data base, the major sources of off-farm employment for&#13;
landless women are identified as food processing, rural works, domestic&#13;
employment, textiles, handicrafts. Industries in which rapidly declining&#13;
employment rates are being experienced due to technological change include&#13;
rice processing, gur, jute, textiles. For each industry, investigations&#13;
covered:&#13;
--   the nature and extent of mechanization including&#13;
technical and economic parameters of technologies used;&#13;
--   the causes of spreading mechanization including private&#13;
profitability and government policies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
--   the impact of technological change on output,&#13;
employment, foreign exchange, income distribution,&#13;
development of local industry, and technological&#13;
capacity; and&#13;
--   attempts to assist women to take advantage of new&#13;
technology within the industry.&#13;
181.      From the detailed investigation of mechanization in existing&#13;
industries, it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the problem in&#13;
terms of displacement of landless women. In the Bangladesh case, for&#13;
example, it was found that alternative workplaces providing between 3.5-5&#13;
million work days per annum are needed to compensate for jobs displaced by&#13;
mechanization in rice processing. Planning for alternatives involves three&#13;
major types of options:&#13;
assistance to women to maintain a hold on rice&#13;
processing through provision of credit and training to&#13;
buy a rice mill or through attempts to improve the&#13;
efficiency of the traditional dheki technology;&#13;
--   assistance to women to maintain a hold on other&#13;
production structures such as oil pressing and gur&#13;
making, through the introduction of improved&#13;
technologies (complete with training and credit);&#13;
--   assistance to women to gain access to a wider range of&#13;
off-farm activities through identification of needs and&#13;
markets and implementation of pilot projects aimed at&#13;
testing the economic viability of involving women's&#13;
groups in production to meet such needs and markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 _&#13;
182.      The Bangladesh case shows how headway has been made in all three&#13;
areas. Evidence of replication of successful projects is very limited, but&#13;
the implementation of projects in the first place is an essential step in&#13;
proving to policy makers and program directors that women contribute to&#13;
national development through their involvement in productive activities.&#13;
C. Policy Implications&#13;
183.      Research and results of pilot projects are of little value if&#13;
ways cannot be found of translating them into action on the part of&#13;
government and other agencies involved in rural development. The&#13;
Bangladesh case shows how account can be taken of the audience for which an&#13;
employment strategy is being written. In particular, policy makers are&#13;
unlikely to repond to requests to create women's employment opportunities&#13;
just for the sake of it. They will respond, however, if sound economic&#13;
reasons can be put forward to show that the policies that are displacing&#13;
women from employment result in a waste of scarce resources and are&#13;
detrimental in terms of achieving national development objectives.&#13;
Similarly, more thought will be given to establishing new activities for&#13;
landless women if proof can be offered of how such activities can make a&#13;
contribution to the national economy.&#13;
184.      In the Bangladesh case, the information reviewed herein can be&#13;
presented as policy recommendations as follows.&#13;
185.      Bangladesh has a chronic unemployment problem, yet proposals for&#13;
rice processing technologies have become increasingly capital-intensive:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
(a) Rural hullers displace much female labor and also&#13;
result in a slightly lower output of rice per maund of&#13;
paddy than other technologies. However, they use less&#13;
capital as well as less labor and are profitable even&#13;
without subsidies. Under the circumstances, they&#13;
should be neither encouraged nor discouraged; in the&#13;
latter respect, it should be remembered that even&#13;
legislation to ban steel hullers in India (so as to&#13;
encourage supposedly more efficient milling equipment)&#13;
could not prevent their spread. Since they will&#13;
continue to be utilized, it would be to society's&#13;
benefit to investigate ways and means of improving&#13;
performance. Also, given the increasing cost to&#13;
society of imported fuel, possibilities of converting&#13;
rural mills to the use of renewable energy&#13;
(particularly improved steam engines utilizing rice&#13;
husks) should be considered. Given that landless&#13;
women are one of the Government's target groups for&#13;
development, every effort should be made to extend&#13;
credit and other assistance to enable them to benefit&#13;
from, rather than be disadvantaged by, the mechanical&#13;
efficiency of the mills and/or to enable them to&#13;
become self-employed in other activities.&#13;
(b) Commercial mills. In the commercial sector, the&#13;
number of non-modernized major mills has increased.&#13;
Automatic mills represent a high cost to society in&#13;
terms of scarce capital and foreign exchange (for&#13;
machinery, spares and fuel). They also pose obvious&#13;
large-scale transport and storage problems which add&#13;
to their cost to society. Operating costs are much&#13;
higher than assumed in project proposals because of&#13;
low capacity utilization. Given the current and&#13;
sanctioned capacity in the commercial sector,&#13;
utilization rates of automatic mills is unlikely to&#13;
rise and their operation will continue to depend on&#13;
subsidies. Benefits to society in terms of quantity&#13;
and quality of rice have been much lower than&#13;
anticipated for a variety of technical and&#13;
institutional reasons. High quality is in any case,&#13;
significant when aiming at international markets; and&#13;
note should be made that the highly priced rice&#13;
exported from Thailand is milled in traditional rural&#13;
hullers. Under the circumstances, further investment&#13;
in automatic mills cannot be recommended. Higher&#13;
returns can be expected from a strategy of incremental&#13;
improvement of technology in non-modernized commercial&#13;
mills. The problem of drying the increasing volumes&#13;
of wet paddy coming onto the market also needs&#13;
solution. Investment on improvement to milling and&#13;
storage facilities in the commercial sector will be&#13;
wasted if paddy continues to be inadequately dried.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Since large-scale mechanical dryers have not proved&#13;
cost-effective, the implications of altering the price&#13;
differential between procured paddy and procured rice&#13;
should be explored. This would increase the incentive&#13;
to provide ready-milled rice; drying would then be&#13;
handled by surplus farmers and/or small mills, thus&#13;
increasing the demand for and economic viability of&#13;
"intermediate" level paddy dryers.&#13;
(c) Dkeki. Since 60 percent of paddy is husked by women&#13;
using the dheki, and given the likelihood of its&#13;
continued use, especially in remote areas, efforts&#13;
should be made to increase its mechanical efficiency&#13;
so as to increase the labor productivity of the women&#13;
using it.&#13;
186.      Increased agricultural production and plans for crop diversifica-&#13;
tion offer possibilities for employment and capital formation in rural&#13;
areas through forward and backward linkages. To maximize these potentially&#13;
beneficial changes, it is essential that policy towards the choice of&#13;
technology be rationalized. The purposes of development are unlikely to be&#13;
served if the demand for improved equipment to overcome bottlenecks in&#13;
production is met only by imported machinery; or if the demand for more and&#13;
improved processing facilities is met only by the establishment of&#13;
large-scale processing plants. The experience with automatic rice mills&#13;
demonstrates that attempts to promote development through reliance on&#13;
capital-intensive imported technology can be counter-productive and it is&#13;
vitally important that similar mistakes are not made in other sectors of&#13;
the economy. A large range of technologies now exist for most processes&#13;
and many increase output and improve quality without the disadvantages of&#13;
large-scale technology in terms of labor displacement and utilization of&#13;
scarce capital and foreign exchange. Such small/medium-scale technologies&#13;
are already in widespread use in many countries of the developing world and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
given their proven economic viability, it is strongly recommended that the&#13;
Government promote their use (after any necessary adaptation to local&#13;
conditions) in Bangladesh. It is of utmost importance that priority be&#13;
given to those machines/products that are capital-saving in both use and&#13;
production and to those technologies which enable economically viable&#13;
production on a small-scale, decentralized basis.&#13;

            The impact of technology choice on rural
            women in Bangladesh : problems and opportunities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Increasing poverty and landlessness in
            Bangladesh are compelling socio-economic change. Part I of
            this paper provides background on the social, cultural, and
            economic issues relevant to the concern for increasing
            women's opportunities for employment and income
            generation in rural Bangladesh. It describes the full range
            of women's economic contribution and importance to the
            rural economy and to the consumption and welfare of their
            families. Some of the Government and nongovernmental
            programs to improve the status and skill of women in
            Bangladesh are described, and approaches are suggested for
            increasing income-earning opportunities. Part II discusses
            the capital and labor intensiveness of various
            crop-processing technologies and their impact on the
            employment of women. After direct crop production,
            post-harvest activities are the most significant source of
            rural employment for women, especially among landless and
            marginal families, those most affected by the loss of
            opportunity due to technological changes. The paper examines
            the extent, causes, and effects of technological changes in
            food processing (especially rice, oil seeds, and sugar) and
            small-scale and cottage industries (jute and silk).
