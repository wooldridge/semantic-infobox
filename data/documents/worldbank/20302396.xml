&#13;
&#13;
Overview	&#13;
&#13;
Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s	economic	growth	moderated	to	6.7	percent	in	the	first	half	of	2014	from	7.5	percent	&#13;
a	 year	 earlier	 as	 activity	 slowed	 in	 almost	 all	 sectors. Weaker	 world economic growth and lower&#13;
prices for cotton and aluminum adversely affected the major export-oriented industries, pushing total&#13;
industrial growth below 3 percent from nearly 7 percent a year earlier. Lower inflows of remittances&#13;
due to the slowdown in Russia have translated into lower domestic demand and slower growth in&#13;
services and housing construction. Though growth in agricultural output also moderated due to heavy&#13;
rains and low temperatures, it was still a healthy 6 percent. Inflation began to pick up as food prices&#13;
rose and tariffs for utilities were adjusted, reaching 4.7 percent for the first half of 2014 compared to&#13;
1.6 percent a year earlier.	 However, fixed investment grew swiftly as the public investment program&#13;
got underway.&#13;
&#13;
GDP	growth	is	projected	to	ease	to	6.5	percent	in	2014	because	of	the	spillover	effect	from	the	&#13;
slowdown	in	Russia	and	in	export	sales. A Russian slowdown affects Tajikistan largely through the&#13;
remittances channel. A slackening in remittances weighs heavily on household demand, notably&#13;
demand for services and housing construction. Inflation pressures are expected to increase but stable&#13;
global food prices should help to keep growth in inflation within a single digit. Despite slower economic&#13;
growth the fiscal deficit is projected to remain unchanged in 2014 because of higher than expected&#13;
revenues from foreign trade, reforms in revenue collection, and spending restraint. The current account&#13;
deficit is projected to widen to 3.7 percent of GDP because of sluggish export growth and the&#13;
remittance slowdown. Tajikistan could perhaps benefit from the Russian ban on import of food from&#13;
the West but fragile market links, limited economies of scale, poor access to credit, and barriers to entry&#13;
and expansion limit Tajik ability to benefit from increased Russian demand.&#13;
&#13;
There	 are	 both	 domestic	 and	 external	 risks.	 The	 main risks to the near-term outlook relate to&#13;
serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the financial sector, fiscal risks from state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SOEs), a slower recovery in the prices of aluminum and cotton, and a further slowdown in&#13;
activity in Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s main trading partners. The pace and financing of large infrastructure projects are&#13;
also very uncertain. The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could&#13;
impact the Tajikistan economy are remittances (partly because migrants may return) and external&#13;
trade. Reinforcing fiscal and external buffers will be critical to mitigate the impact of external shocks,&#13;
particularly in light of the Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s strong links with Russia and such other trading partners as&#13;
Kazakhstan, Turkey, and China. In the near term, prudent macroeconomic policies, such as greater&#13;
exchange rate flexibility, could help the country absorb any shocks.&#13;
&#13;
Because	the	risks	are	intensifying,	Tajikistan	needs	to	put	in	place	a	comprehensive	structural	&#13;
reform	program	 to	 bolster	growth,	job	creation,	and	poverty	reduction.	 Reforms to improve the&#13;
business-enabling environment need to go hand in hand with comprehensive public sector reform.&#13;
High priorities are to address financial sector vulnerabilities and assure proper SOE governance to&#13;
minimize fiscal risks and deliver services to consumers cost-efficiently. Beyond the general reform task,&#13;
many sectors where SOEs operate, such as energy, infrastructure, and delivery of other services, have&#13;
specific challenges to be addressed. Policies to facilitate absorption of returning migrants into the local&#13;
labor market will also be important. Over the medium term, prudent macroeconomic management and&#13;
structural reforms directed to diversification and better integration into global and regional markets&#13;
would create more economic opportunities and reduce Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s vulnerability to shocks. Investing in&#13;
human and institutional capital would support productivity improvements and job creation and speed&#13;
the transition to a more sustainable growth model.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.        Recent	Economic	Developments	&#13;
&#13;
Economic	Growth	and	Domestic	Demand	&#13;
Tajikistan	 has	 felt	 the	 impact	 of	 Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s	 slowdown	 through	 the	 decline	 in	 remittances.	&#13;
In 2013 remittances equaling almost 50 percent of GDP made Tajikistan the most remittance-&#13;
dependent country in the world. Over 90 percent of those remittances originate in Russia, so that&#13;
remittances are bound to be an important channel through which the Russian slowdown spills over&#13;
onto the Tajik economy.1 According to the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), the impact has so far been&#13;
moderate: after 19 percent growth in 2013, in the first six months of 2014 the inflow of remittances to&#13;
Tajikistan dropped by about 2 percent year-on-year (Figure 1).&#13;
&#13;
Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s	economic	growth	moderated	from	7.5	percent	a	year	earlier	to	6.7	percent	for	the	&#13;
first	half	of	2014	due	to	weaker	activity	in	almost	all	sectors. Weaker world economic growth and&#13;
lower prices for cotton and aluminum dampened Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s exports. A contraction in the production&#13;
of the major export-oriented industries, aluminum and textiles, dragged down total industrial output&#13;
growth from 6.6 percent a year earlier to less than 3 percent y/y (Figure 2). Slowing remittances have&#13;
been translated into lower domestic demand and slower growth in services and housing construction.&#13;
Fixed investment, by contrast, expanded by 28.4 percent from 9.3 percent a year earlier as the public&#13;
investment program got underway. Heavy rains and low temperatures slowed growth in agricultural&#13;
production to 6 percent from 12.1 percent a year earlier. Services and â&#128;&#156;other sectorsâ&#128;&#157; continue to&#13;
contribute 65.3 percent of total economic growth, followed by agriculture at 13.2 percent.&#13;

&#13;
Poverty	and	the	Labor	Market		&#13;
In	 June	 2014	 major	 job	 creation	 in	 services	 pushed	 up	 wage	 employment	 by	 1.6	 percent	 y/y.&#13;
Employment in services increased by 4.6 percent, largely due to more jobs in health and education.&#13;
Employment in agriculture has been declining on average by 1 percent a year for the past three years,&#13;
reflecting a move toward urbanization (migration of rural residents abroad or to cities in Tajikistan) as&#13;
well as the response to shocks to input or output prices and livestock diseases. According to a recent&#13;
World Bank study, international migration is the main strategy households adopt to cope with climate-&#13;
related shocks: more than a third of drought events triggered migration by at least one household&#13;
member.2&#13;

Despite	a	stable	official	unemployment	rate,	there	are	signs	of	increasing	pressure	on	the	labor	&#13;
market.	 Registered	 unemployment was 2.5 percent in June of both 2013 and 2014.	 Hidden&#13;
unemploymentâ&#128;&#148;those on forced leave or working shorter hoursâ&#128;&#148;was up marginally to 0.7 percent in&#13;
June 2014 from 0.6 percent a year earlier. Furthermore, the ratio of registered unemployed per vacancy&#13;
rose to 6.9 in June 2014 from 6.1 in June 2013. A big chunk of the officially unemployed have no&#13;
professional qualifications or have lost skills due to lengthy lay-offs; and more than 63 percent of them&#13;
have at most only a general secondary education. All these factors make them less employable.&#13;
According to the latest Labor Force Survey, conducted in 2009, the unemployment rate in Tajikistan&#13;
was 11.5 percentâ&#128;&#148;nearly four times greater than the official unemployment rate for the same year.&#13;
The latest ILO modeled estimates (10.8 percent in 2013) suggest that the gap between official&#13;
(registered) and true unemployment has widened since 2009. High wage growth also suggests that the&#13;
labor market is tightening. Real wages grew by almost 17 percent on average y/y in June 2014, with the&#13;
highest growth (25.1 percent on average) recorded in financial intermediation, trade, transport and&#13;
communication, education, and health (Figure 3). The growth in education and health wages was due to&#13;
a 20 percent average increase in public sector wages that went into effect September 1, 2013.3&#13;

&#13;
The	minimum	wage	grew	faster	than	the	national	average	and	rose	above	the	poverty	line.	 The	&#13;
minimum wage tripled between 2009 and 2014 in both nominal and real terms to the current TJS 250&#13;
per month, US$50 (Figure 4). However, it is comparable only to the average wage in agriculture;&#13;
average wages in other sectors are far higher. Until 2012, the minimum wage was constantly below the&#13;
poverty line. It has since risen above that line, which is a positive sign.&#13;
&#13;
To	date	Tajikistan	has	done	a	remarkable	job	of	reducing	poverty.	 The national poverty rate fell&#13;
from 96 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 2009 and an estimated 36 percent in 2013.4 Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s pace&#13;
of poverty reduction in the past 15 years has been among the top 10 percent in the world.5 If the same&#13;
pace can be sustained, by 2025 Tajikistan could reduce poverty to 14 percent and before then should&#13;
meet President Rahmonâ&#128;&#153;s target of bringing poverty down to 20 percent by 2020.&#13;
&#13;
Box	1.	Council	for	poverty	and	middle	class	measurement	in	Tajikistan	&#13;
The need for a national methodology for measuring poverty became acute when the Government shifted focus&#13;
from Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) to Household Budget Surveys (HBS) to assess and monitor&#13;
poverty. To help the government and TajStat design a sound poverty measurement methodology, the World Bank&#13;
advocated establishment of an advisory committee , where experts from government, the statistical office, the&#13;
private sector, academia, and civil society could together discuss and recommend a methodology suitable for&#13;
Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s needs.&#13;
In May 2014, the Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office created and appointed members to the Council for Poverty and Middle&#13;
Class Measurement. The Council is an advisory body operating under the Ministry of Economic Development and&#13;
Trade of the Republic of Tajikistan (MoEDT). It ensures interaction between public authorities and institutions,&#13;
representatives of academia, and donor communities in designing and putting in place the national methodology&#13;
for measuring the poverty level and the middle class in Tajikistan. Represented on the Council are the MoEDT,&#13;
TajStat, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, State Investment Committee, and State Property Management and&#13;
Strategic Research Center under the President. The Council has two tiers, with the upper tier (responsible for&#13;
policy) led by MoEDT and the lower tier (technical) led by TajStat. The plan is for the upper tier to meet quarterly&#13;
and the lower tier to meet more often. The first meeting of the Council took place on August 6, 2014. The&#13;
objectives of the Council are to:&#13;
â&#128;¢ discuss poverty and the middle class indicators and make recommendations for their adjustment and&#13;
  transparency;&#13;
â&#128;¢ discuss program on implementing the National Development Strategy and medium-term strategies;&#13;
â&#128;¢ justify the poverty and middle-class indicators from an economic development perspective;&#13;
â&#128;¢ discuss and formulate recommendations for adjustment of poverty and middle-class indicators; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ ensure that poverty indicators are transparent based on international best practices.&#13;

  Since 1999, monetary poverty has been measured using the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS)&#13;
primarily prepared and financed by the World Bank with help from TajStat. A new but preliminary poverty rate of&#13;
36 percent is based on 2012/2013 data from the national Household Budget Survey (HBS). Due to differences in&#13;
methodology, this number is not strictly comparable with poverty numbers reported in the past, and represents a&#13;
structural break of the reported series (see Box 1).&#13;

&#13;
The	 country	 has	 done	 less	 well	 in	 reducing	 nonmonetary	 than	 monetary	 poverty. While&#13;
methodologies have changed and hence the poverty rates obtained should not be compared, it is still&#13;
clear that in the past 15 years monetary poverty has gone down substantially. However, to understand&#13;
the full picture in terms of living standards it is necessary to look beyond monetary poverty. To analyze&#13;
aspects of poverty other than monetary, the Tajikistan team used the multidimensional poverty index&#13;
(MPI) methodology developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative.6 The analysis&#13;
found that 32 percent of the Tajik population was multidimensionally poor in 2007 and 34 percent&#13;
in 2013, with marked differences in the different dimensions of nonmonetary poverty. Between 2007&#13;
and 2013, the number of people who reported dissatisfaction with life, reported health to be a key&#13;
concern, and reported not having enough money to buy food went down, but there was a significant&#13;
worsening of access to heating and sewerage infrastructure (Figure 5). Decomposition of the MPI&#13;
dimensions shows that Education, Sewerage, and Poor heating are the main contributors to&#13;
multidimensional poverty in Tajikistan (Figure 6). By region, only Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous&#13;
Oblast (GBAO) shows a steep drop in multidimensional poverty (from 42 percent in 2007 to 25 percent&#13;
in 2013), the MPI rate was unchanged in Khatlon, and in all other regions multidimensional poverty&#13;
went up. 7&#13;

6 Data from LSMS 2007 and a separate household survey were used for this analysis and the results show some&#13;
inconsistencies with the results of monetary poverty assessments. The MPI dimensions used for Tajikistan were&#13;
Single-female-headed household, Age dependency, Secondary education, Tertiary education, Health, Employment,&#13;
Sewage, Electricity, and Poverty. These dimensions were chosen because that they are mentioned as priority areas&#13;
in the strategic development documents of the Government and the World Bank. For an explanation of the&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The	 findings	 of	 the	 MPI	 analysis	 of	 Tajikistan	 suggest	 that	 different	 policy	 measures	 may	 be	&#13;
needed	 to	 tackle	 the	 incidence	 of	 poverty	 when	 nonmonetary	 poverty	 is	 stubbornly	 high. The&#13;
main conclusions of the MPI analysis are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Lack of sewerage, poor heating, and lack of access to secondary and tertiary education are the main&#13;
    contributors to multidimensional poverty.	&#13;
â&#128;¢   The same dimensions seem to be those most unequally distributed among the population:&#13;
    o Heating and sewerage problems differ by region and by urban or rural residence. 	&#13;
    o Education is also associated with poverty&#13;
â&#128;¢   Improvement was recorded in terms of both coverage and inequality between 2007 and 2013 in&#13;
    terms of both monetary poverty and self-assessment of health.&#13;
â&#128;¢   However, both coverage and inequality worsened in such areas as demography, electricity&#13;
    interruptions, and employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
External	Accounts		&#13;
The	 trade	 deficit	 widened	 to	 $1.85	 billion	 in	 January-June	 2014	 because	 of	 lower	 exports	 and	&#13;
continued	growth	in	imports. Less external demand and lower prices for major export commodities&#13;
caused the value of exports to contract by almost 15 percent y/y in the first two quarters of 2014. The&#13;
decline was recorded for all major export categories, not just cotton and aluminum, though they are the&#13;
most important. Import of goods shot up by about 24 percent driven by soaring imports of capital&#13;
goods. However, the Tajik somoni depreciated only moderately compared to the currencies of major&#13;
trade partners (see more in the monetary and exchange rate policy section), so to date the impact of the&#13;
depreciation on the external position has been negligible.&#13;
&#13;
Given	its	high	product	and	export	market	concentration,	the	economy	is	vulnerable	to	external	&#13;
shocks. Despite some product diversification, Tajikistan continues to export very few products: about&#13;
160 out of a possible 5,000, the second lowest among Central Asia countries after Turkmenistan. Export&#13;
markets have not been very dynamic either, with Tajik products reaching only 45 markets, the fewest&#13;
in the region.8 Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s top six export markets in the first half of 2014â&#128;&#148;Switzerland, Turkey,&#13;
Kazakhstan, Iran, Russia, and Afghanistanâ&#128;&#148;accounted for over 88 percent of its total exports.9 Imports&#13;
were even more concentrated, with Russia, China, and Kazakhstan accounting for over 57 percent of&#13;
the total. Relatively low growth rates in the economies of its major trading partners, especially Turkey&#13;
and Russia, have depressed demand for Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s aluminum and cotton. As a result, aluminum&#13;
exports plunged by almost 50 percent and cotton exports by 46 percent y/y. Notwithstanding the drop&#13;
in exports of these two strategically important commodities, aluminum and cotton still accounted for&#13;
about one-third of total export value (Figure 8).&#13;

&#13;
diversification of agriculture creates incentives for more productive private farms. The expected&#13;
moderate recovery of cotton prices could be met by exporting more cotton fiber.&#13;
&#13;
Because	 of	 less	 demand	 and	 lower	 international	 prices,	 the	 aluminum	 smelter,	 TALCO,	 cut	 its	&#13;
production	in	the	first	half	of	2014. According to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade&#13;
(MEDT), aluminum production amounted to almost 64,000 tons in the first half of 2014â&#128;&#148;45.7 percent&#13;
less than in the same period of 2013. However, because global aluminum prices began to rise in July (13&#13;
percent higher than at the beginning of 2014), the outlook is moderately optimistic. TALCO has&#13;
designed an action plan to attract more foreign investment to modernize and increase the efficiency of&#13;
its production and has requested government support in the form of guarantees. However, a thorough&#13;
review of TALCO operations and all ownership and management options is needed to ensure that the&#13;
companyâ&#128;&#153;s export-driven production path is viable.&#13;
&#13;
Export	 of	 agriculture	 products,	 processed	 as	 well	 as	 fresh,	 is	 growing,	 with	 Russia	 and	&#13;
Kazakhstan	the	largest	markets. Tajikistan represents only 3 percent of Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s fruit and vegetable&#13;
imports. In the first two quarters of 2014 exports to Russia, primarily agricultural produce, increased&#13;
by 15.2 percent y/y and the GoT plans to increase export of fruits and vegetables in response to the&#13;
Russian ban on import of those goods from the West. However, fragile market links, limited economies&#13;
of scale, poor access to credit, and barriers to entry and expansion constrain the potential for a quick&#13;
supply response. Resolution of these problems will require a shift in the priorities for sector&#13;
development, with more emphasis on private sector development. Measures to increase the&#13;
commercialization of agriculture will be integral to the new priorities.&#13;

Tajikistan	is	working	to	reduce	logistics	costs	in	response	to	the	problems	caused	by	its	location	&#13;
and	 the	 lack	 of	 transportation	 infrastructure. The only railway that can be used to export goods&#13;
passes through Uzbekistan, and higher tariffs there have raised transportation costs. Moreover,&#13;
according to the MEDT, the average distance to reach the end buyers of Tajik aluminum is 4,156 km and&#13;
the average distance to reach the final consumers of Tajik cotton is 3,241 km. This makes aluminum&#13;
and cotton prices less competitive, so local producers have to reduce their margins. The only way for&#13;
them to become sustainably competitive is to raise production efficiency and reduce the logistics costs.&#13;
Tajikistan ranked 114th out of 160 countries in the 2014 Logistics Performance Index10 (LPI). The LPI&#13;
score show that Tajik trade facilitation is below the regional average but higher than averages for other&#13;
countries in its income group (Figure 10). Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s total LPI score was higher in 2014 than in 2012,&#13;
but much more needs to be done to create an environment conducive to international trade.&#13;
&#13;
Though	inflows	of	remittances	were	declining,	imports	continued	to	grow	at	a	high	rate,	driven	&#13;
by	imports	of	capital	goods	and	minerals. High investment growth fuelled imports of capital goods&#13;
and minerals, but the contraction in aluminum production led to the decline in imports of alumina&#13;
(Figure 9 and 10). Imports of machines and equipment surged by 51.1 percent y/y in the first two&#13;
quarters of 2014 compared to a 2.8 percent contraction a year earlier. Import of optical, medical, and&#13;
electrical tools, which had declined by 14.6 percent in 2013, soared by 227 percent. The value&#13;
of imported transport vehicles, the lionâ&#128;&#153;s share of which are passenger cars, went up by only a&#13;
meager 0.4 percent y/y in the first half of 2014 after a 36.3 percent rise in 2013. The change&#13;

Efficiency of the clearance process (i.e., speed, simplicity and predictability of formalities) by border control&#13;
agencies, including customs; (2) quality of trade and transport-related infrastructure (e.g., ports, railroads, roads,&#13;
information technology); (3) ease of arranging competitively priced shipments; (4) competence and quality of&#13;
logistics services (e.g., transport operators, customs brokers); (5) ability to track and trace consignments; (6)&#13;
timeliness of shipments in reaching destination within the scheduled or expected delivery time. The scorecards&#13;

contracted by 10.8 percent y/y; how lower remittances are affecting imports of other consumer goods&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;

B.                     Economic	and	Structural	Policies	&#13;
&#13;
Monetary	and	Exchange	Rate	Policies	&#13;
As	 inflation	 began	 to	 head	 up,	 monetary	 policy	 was	 gradually	 tightened. After two cuts&#13;
in 2013 and one in January 2014, the NBT raised the refinancing rate by 110 basis points to 5.9 percent&#13;
in May because of inflation dynamics. The impact of monetary tightening on domestic demand and&#13;
inflation has been limited, however, because the share of NBT funding at the refinancing rate in the&#13;
banking sector is very low. Accordingly, there is a significant gap between the refinancing and the&#13;
interbank loan rates, which stood at 14.14 percent as of July 2014 (Figure 12).&#13;
&#13;
Supported	 by	 the	 NBT	 interventions,	 Tajik	 somoni	 depreciated	 less	 than	 other	 regional	&#13;
currencies,	but	the	scope	for	interventions	is	limited	because	reserves	are	low.	 The somoni had&#13;
depreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 4.6 percent by mid-September 2014 (y/y), significantly less&#13;
than the Russian ruble (18.1 percent) and the Kazakhstani tenge (18.6 percent). Continued weakening&#13;
of regional currencies will heighten the pressure on somoni, but at the beginning of July Tajik reserves&#13;
stood at just below US$600 million, or about 1.2 months of imports of goods and services. To replenish&#13;
international reserves, the NBT has converted its stock of nonmonetary gold into monetary goldâ&#128;&#148;a&#13;
long-awaited measure, recommended by the IMF. 	&#13;

Financial	Sector		&#13;
The	 banking	 sector	 in	 Tajikistan	 worsened	 in	 2013â&#128;&#147;14,	 with	 governance	 issues	 and	&#13;
enforcement	 of	 prudential	 regulations	 continuing	 to	 be	 of	 concern. Banking system indicators&#13;
show a continuing deterioration in asset quality as nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose from 18 percent&#13;
at yearend-2012 to 23 percent at end-2013 and 25 percent by mid-2014 (Figure 13). Moreover, actual&#13;
NPLs are probably higher because loans continue to be seriously misclassified. The reported aggregate&#13;
capital adequacy ratio for the banking system dropped from 25.9 percent in December 2012 to&#13;
19.5 percent in June 2014. The reported return on assets (ROA) was a dismal 1.4 percent at mid-&#13;
2014â&#128;&#148;although still up from 0.7 percent at yearend-2013. Similarly, the reported return on equity&#13;
(ROE) went from 0.7 percent at the end of 2012 to 8.8 percent at mid-2014. However, misclassification&#13;

&#13;
of some loans and under-provisioning of NPLs suggests that capital, ROA, and ROE are all overstated.&#13;
Moreover, the aggregate numbers disguise severe stress in individual banks. Many banks that face&#13;
liquidity pressures due to maturity mismatches have been increasingly dependent on the NBT for loans&#13;
to meet their funding needs. The financial system is at risk of future shocks.&#13;
&#13;
It	 is	 urgent	 that	 the	 government	 cease	 inappropriate	 interventions	 and	 that	 the	 NBT	 cease	 its	&#13;
forbearance	 for	 problem	 banks. Among factors exacerbating the deterioration in asset quality are&#13;
weaknesses in bank risk management systems; inadequate regulatory and supervisory framework and&#13;
enforcement by the NBT; and weaknesses in financial infrastructure. Most troubling, however, is&#13;
government interference in commercial bank decisions related to lending, branches, and&#13;
mergers, and in NBTâ&#128;&#153;s ability to intervene in problem banks. Directed lending in 2009â&#128;&#147;11 and again&#13;
in 2013 undermined the quality of the loan portfolio by adversely impacting bank risk management&#13;
systems and financial positions, undermining the NBTâ&#128;&#153;s independence as bank regulator and&#13;
supervisor and also the credit culture. The case of Agroinvestbank (AIB) is the most serious example of&#13;
default on directed loans, followed by new directed loans to some of the same parties. Repeated use of&#13;
the budget to recapitalize AIB, purchase bad loans, or repay AIB on behalf of delinquent borrowers&#13;
represents transfers from taxpayers to delinquent borrowers and undermines development of a strong&#13;
credit culture. While the government has again replaced the management of AIB, NBTâ&#128;&#153;s interventions&#13;
are still few and feeble, and only a small fraction of NPLs has been collected.&#13;
&#13;
Not	only	is	financial	intermediation	limited	in	Tajikistan,	so	is	its	support	for	economic	growth.	&#13;
Tajikistan ranks lower in credit and deposit penetration than other countries in the&#13;
region. Deposits as a share of GDP were 13.6 percent in June 2014, only slightly up from 13.1 at&#13;
yearend-2013 and 13.3 percent at yearend-2012. Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP jumped&#13;
from 13.9 percent in 2012 to 19 percent in 2013 and stayed there in the first half of 2014, as credit&#13;
grew at a worrying 53 percent, undeterred by poor financial sector governance and high&#13;
NPLs. In the latest Doing Business rankings, on the Getting Credit indicator Tajikistan is ranked 159th&#13;
out of 189 countries.11 From one hand, the percentage of Tajik firms considering access to finance not to&#13;
be an obstacle to current operations increased from 29.7 percent in the 2008 Business Environment&#13;
and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) to 44.9 percent in 2013; from the other hand, the&#13;
percentage considering access to finance to be a major or severe obstacle rose from 25 to 26 percent&#13;
(for a more detailed discussion of the 2013 BEEPS findings see section 4). Improving access to credit,&#13;
particularly for small and medium-sized entities, requires, among other things, that Tajikistan enforces&#13;
its regulations, builds up the credit culture, reinforces the financial infrastructure, modernizes the&#13;
secured transactions system, and strengthens risk management.&#13;
&#13;
Microfinance	organizations	(MFOs)	continue	to	grow,	are	typically	well-governed,	and	are	filling	&#13;
many	 gaps	 left	 by	 the	 banking	 sector,	 but	 insurance	 is	 still	 embryonic. MFOs are having an&#13;
impact in rural areas; their loans as a percentage of national GDP grew from 3.4 percent at&#13;
yearend 2013 to 3.7 percent by mid-2014. Their NPLs fell from an already-low 1.2 percent in 2013 to&#13;
1.0 percent by July 2014. Unlike banks, MFOs have adopted a code of consumer protection. In contrast,&#13;
consumer confidence in the insurance sector is extremely low. In 2013, the ratio of insurance payouts&#13;
to premiums was only 11.3 percent, compared to 80â&#128;&#147;90 percent in more developed economies,&#13;
suggesting little benefit to policy holders in Tajikistan. This raises the risk for public safety as well as&#13;
allocating resources inefficiently.&#13;

Fiscal	Policy	&#13;
The	 budget	 deficit	 narrowed	 to	 0.6	 percent	 of	 GDP	 in	 the	 first	 six	 months	&#13;
of	2014	from	1.3	percent	in	2013	due	to	buoyant	revenue	performance	and	spending	restraint.&#13;
Because of improved collection and higher proceeds from foreign economic activities,&#13;
revenue grew by 15.4 percent in nominal terms y/y in the first two quarters, exceeding budgeted&#13;
revenues by 2.4 percent; and expenditures were less than 90 percent of their target. Excluding the&#13;
externally financed public investment program (PIP), the budget was in surplus of 2.7 percent of GDP in&#13;
the first half of 2014 (Figure 14). However, the true fiscal picture is likely to be less positive because of&#13;
the elaborate quasifiscal activities of SOEs.12&#13;

calculations.&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
In	 the	 first	 half	 of	 2014,	 revenue	 collection	 amounted	 to	 33.7	 percent	 of	 GDP,	 above	 the	 six-&#13;
month	target	by	2.4	percent. However, performance was uneven. Several large taxes brought in much&#13;
more than projected, primarily excises (26.3 percent more), income tax (3.5 percent more), and value-&#13;
added tax (VAT; 3.3 percent more). Non-tax proceeds exceeded the target by 12.9 percent. Installation&#13;
of special software programs to ensure better control over medium-sized and large&#13;
taxpayers heightened revenue collection. But proceeds from the sales tax on aluminum plummeted to&#13;
just 1.6 percent of the target because TALCOâ&#128;&#153;s production and sales fell. Similarly, lower sales of cotton&#13;
brought in less than 55 percent of what was expected.&#13;
&#13;
Government	spending	 hit	30.7	 percent	of	GDP	 in	 the	first	 half	 of	 2014,	up	from	 28.2	percent	a	&#13;
year	 earlier,	 and	 its	 composition	 shifted	 toward	 social	 sectors. In the first half of 2014, social&#13;
spending accounted for almost 52.8 percent of total expenditures, equivalent of 16.2 percent of GDP&#13;
(Figure 15). Social protection and education benefited the most from higher outlays, but spending on&#13;
health in relation to GDP, already the lowest in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), decreased slightly.&#13;
Pressure for more social outlays is growing. As argued in the World Bank Programmatic Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, the largest source of fiscal space for social sectors is expected to come from sound&#13;
macroeconomic policies and accelerated structural reforms that would support economic growth,&#13;
increase government revenues, and thus make affordable more social investment in response to&#13;

projected demographic trends and the need for better quality. Given the limited fiscal space, the&#13;
government needs to give high priority to greater spending efficiency and better public investment and&#13;
management of public finances.13&#13;
&#13;
Government	 debtâ&#128;&#148;of	 which	 three-quarters	 is	 owed	 to	 external	 creditorsâ&#128;&#148;fell	 further	 in	 the	&#13;
second	 quarter	 of	 2014,	 largely	 because	 of	 loan	 repayments. Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s public and publicly&#13;
guaranteed external debt-to-GDP ratio went down from 25.4 percent of GDP in 2013 to 21.9 percent as&#13;
of July 1, 2014 (Figure 16). The major contribution to this decline was repayments on Chinese, Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB), and European Union loans. At the same time, a new loan agreement for&#13;
$13.07 million was signed with the Islamic Development Bank for reconstruction of substation&#13;
Ravshan. The Chinese Export-Import Bank remained Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s largest creditor; as of July 1, 2014, its&#13;
loans represented about 41.3 percent of total external public debt. The other large lenders are the&#13;
World Bank with a 16.4 percent share and the ADB with a 14.3 percent share.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
Structural	Reforms	&#13;
Financial	Sector	Reform	&#13;
&#13;
Legal Prudential Norms and Supervision&#13;
 To address the numerous challenges emerging from the domestic banking system, Parliament has&#13;
passed new laws and regulations directed to improving banking supervision and registration of&#13;
collateral. Among them are laws on secured transactions and Islamic banking; draft insurance and&#13;
consumer protection laws; and a number of NBT regulations to enhance commercial bank compliance&#13;
with prudential norms to prevent the risks of bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the secured transaction law&#13;
underplayed the role of the NBT, giving more authority to the Ministry of Justice. Continued efforts are&#13;
needed to draft regulations that empower the NBT in its supervisory role for the secured transaction&#13;
registry.&#13;
&#13;
AIB Resolution&#13;
Despite a bailout in April 2012 that, among other things, transferred 37 directed loans from AIB to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in return for TJS 500 million in bonds to AIB, and an MoF injection of&#13;
TJS 200 million in capital and twice replacement of AIB executive management (in 2012 and again in&#13;
2013), the financial condition of AIB has deteriorated steeply.&#13;
&#13;
The AIB is a key Tajik intermediary, and its effective resolution could help transform the financial&#13;
sector and the economy at large. Through its extensive branch network, a well-functioning AIB could be&#13;
a major source of credit and help unleash the potential of SMEs and the agricultural sector. A robust&#13;
AIB might also attract long-term financing from foreign banks and international financial institutions&#13;
(IFIs) to support long-term investment and growth. A joint World Bank-IMF technical assistance&#13;
mission was in Tajikistan in May 2014 to advise the authorities on options for a lasting AIB resolution&#13;
based on both the best international experience and the country-specific circumstances.	 The Bank and&#13;
the IMF stand ready to provide support should the authorities decide to resolve AIB using one of the&#13;
proposed options. An acceptable resolution package for the AIB is a requirement for the new budget&#13;
support	series for Tajikistan.&#13;
&#13;
Energy	Sector	Restructuring	&#13;
&#13;
Continuing deterioration of the power sector poses increasing risks to (1) proper system provision of&#13;
energy to the economy and population as a core public good; (2) macrofiscal stability; and (3) the&#13;
prospects for and viability of any potential large investments in hydropower projects. Barki Tojik (BT),&#13;
the national power company, has been facing a significant revenue-expenditure gap, a quasifiscal deficit&#13;
(QFD), because of chronic loss-making tariffs, insufficient cash collections on electricity invoices, and&#13;
high technical electricity losses. If short-term recovery costs alone are taken into account, the QFD in&#13;
the power sector of about 2 percent of GDP in 2013 is large enough to create serious fiscal risks.	 The&#13;
estimated true economic subsidy cost in 2013 based on long-run average incremental costs could be&#13;
as large as 15 percent of Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s GDP. BTâ&#128;&#153;s tax arrears soared in 2011â&#128;&#147;13 to the equivalent of&#13;
almost 5 percent of total tax revenues. The company also delayed repaying loans from the MoF and&#13;
paying independent power producers and other creditors. BT is not able to either properly rehabilitate&#13;
and maintain its current assets nor invest in new energy infrastructure. Transparency and&#13;
accountability are minimal, and BT also lacks commercial and financial management skills, which&#13;
undermines not only its performance but also its credibility. What is needed is systemic intervention to&#13;
both contain losses and improve BT operational and management efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
In 2014 the government moved as follows to improve BTâ&#128;&#153;s the financial situation:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14 Economic and Structural Policies&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GoT Resolution #302 (May 2014) stipulated an offset scheme between enterprises of the Agency&#13;
    for Melioration and Irrigation, BT, and the budget that is equivalent to about TJS 243 million and&#13;
    deferred BT tax payments of TJS 170 million for three years. The resolution, however, does not&#13;
    provide any concrete measures or a schedule for improving the companyâ&#128;&#153;s financial viability; nor&#13;
    does it prevent the use of nontransparent and costly schemes to temporarily relieve future&#13;
    pressures.&#13;
â&#128;¢   BT approved an internal action plan for improving its operational efficiency and financial viability.&#13;
â&#128;¢   As of July 1st, electricity and heat tariffs were raised by about 15 percent, except for TALCO, whose&#13;
    annual average tariff was increased by about 56 percent. Higher tariffs should be accompanied by&#13;
    measures to improve cash collection and reduce technical losses. The new targeted social&#13;
    assistance program, launched by the GoT in 2011 as a pilot and gradually expanded since then to&#13;
    reach the national scale by 2016, could help responding to the energy tariff increases and any&#13;
    future economic shocks by enabling a quick and effective mechanism of outreach to the poorest.&#13;
â&#128;¢   BT, supported by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
    (EBRD), has been scaling up installation of modern electricity meters and billing systems in the&#13;
    Dushanbe and Sughd regions.&#13;
&#13;
Regulation	of	Business		&#13;
&#13;
Progress in regulatory reforms was slow in 2012â&#128;&#147;13. In the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business 2014 report,&#13;
Tajikistan ranked 143rd globally and 25th regionally on ease of doing business.&#13;
&#13;
In 2014 with support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), work has continued on drafting&#13;
a new law to introduce a risk-based inspection system that will be legally binding for all types of&#13;
business inspections (sanitary, tax, etc.). Another new law will set out an evaluation checklist to assess&#13;
an inspectorâ&#128;&#153;s performance in terms of preventive and consulting services (rather than the prevailing&#13;
violation and punishment approach).&#13;
&#13;
The government introduced the following improvements in the business-enabling environment in&#13;
2013â&#128;&#147;14; they are expected to be reflected in the 2015 Doing Business report:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   TajStat was given the power to issue the statistics code for the new business at the time of&#13;
    registration. This is expected to make starting a business easier.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The fee to obtain the architectural planning assignment was reduced. This is expected to&#13;
    make dealing with construction permits less costly.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Credit bureaus have established two years of historical data since 2010, including retroactive data&#13;
    on loan agreements for most borrowers, and have begun to provide credit scores. This is expected&#13;
    to improve access to credit information.&#13;
â&#128;¢   An electronic system for filing and paying corporate income tax, VAT, and labor taxes was&#13;
    introduced. This is expected to make paying taxes easier.&#13;
&#13;
Reform	of	Tax	Administration		&#13;
&#13;
A public awareness campaign is continuing to inform entrepreneurs and SMEs about the benefits of&#13;
using electronic tools to file and submit tax declarations. As for tax committee (TC) modernization and&#13;
administration, the number of taxpayers who file electronically more than quadrupled between June&#13;
2013 and June 2014 (to 4,700) and continues to grow quickly. As recommended by the Bank team, the&#13;
TC now provides an electronic token free of charge to taxpayers who register for e-filing. In addition to&#13;
making filing easier for taxpayers, e-filing also reduces TC administrative costs. Almost 90 percent of&#13;
large taxpayers file electronically and their doing so will soon be mandatory. The TC continues to&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        Economic and Structural Policies |15&#13;
&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
introduce interim IT services to meet immediate TC needs until the new IT system (Integrated Tax&#13;
Management Software â&#128;&#147; ITMS) is up and running.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, the TC, with support from the World Bank Tax Administration Reform Project (TARP),&#13;
continues to modernize the information system, build the capacity of both central and local office staffs,&#13;
and promote e-filing platforms in order to reduce corruption-prone physical interactions between tax&#13;
inspectors and entrepreneurs. So far, the TC reports, 6,000 taxpayers submitted tax declarations&#13;
electronically for 2013â&#128;&#147;14, and 2,200 calls to the new TC hotline were answered.&#13;
&#13;
The real challenge is to secure the right balance between tax administration and tax policy to ensure&#13;
equity and efficiency. This should help to avoid overtaxing the private sector and prevent possible&#13;
shrinkage of the tax base.&#13;
&#13;
Public	Financial	Management	&#13;
&#13;
The government is also moving to implement the new accounting policy and a unified chart of accounts&#13;
(UCOA) consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001 and the&#13;
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) adapted to local accounting capacity and&#13;
systems. Of the 32 IPSAS, 10 have been approved and are expected to go into effect on January 1, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The new UCOA and the revised budget classification, which incorporates GFSM 2001-based economic&#13;
and functional categories, have been applied to budget execution since January 1, 2014.&#13;
&#13;
As approved last year, work is now underway on a new organizational structure for both central and&#13;
regional Treasury offices. The new structure will add functional units responsible for commitment&#13;
control, cash management, and accounting.&#13;
&#13;
With regard to modernizing public financial management (PFM), all data for the 2014 budget were&#13;
introduced into the new SGB.NET budget preparation module. A new PFM information system SGB.NET&#13;
went into operation in January 2014; it is expected that the government will ultimately have a Financial&#13;
Management Information System operational that covers Treasury functions across the whole of&#13;
Tajikistan. Automated data exchange and submission will include, in addition to the core Treasury&#13;
functions, modules for managing assets, payroll, and revenue administration.&#13;
&#13;
Work on extending the Treasury Single Account is underway.&#13;
&#13;
So far, medium-term expenditure frameworks have been drafted for six pilot sectors. The pilot&#13;
ministries identified sector-related programs and subprograms to be used as the basis for formulating&#13;
baseline budgets. At present, there are 10 to 20 programs, developed by the lead line ministries for&#13;
each pilot sector. The budget submissions presented to the MoF cover a three-year period. The MoF is&#13;
currently designing a program classification as a constituent of a complete budget classification.&#13;
&#13;
Social	Protection	&#13;
&#13;
The major reforms in the social protection system were related to institutional changes, with transfer&#13;
of the social protection function from the former Ministry of Labor and Social Protection to the Ministry&#13;
of Health and Social Protection (MHSP) as part of the roll-out of the registry and the targeted social&#13;
assistance (TSA) program. The intent is to make social cash transfers more targeted and thus more&#13;
efficient. The World Bank	 is now providing additional support to the new State Agency for Social&#13;
Protection under the MHSP, which will manage the TSA program.&#13;
&#13;
The government launched the pilot of the TSA program in two districts in 2011, applying a proxy-&#13;
means test to identify needy households. New targeted poverty benefits will replace the former flat-&#13;
&#13;
16 Economic and Structural Policies&#13;

&#13;
rate universal benefits. Evaluation of the pilot found significant improvements in targeting: the new&#13;
mechanism was approximately twice as accurate in directing social assistance to poor households as&#13;
the legacy programs. Moreover, though transfer amounts were small, beneficiary households reported&#13;
significantly higher satisfaction. However, the evaluation also identified areas for improvement. In&#13;
2013 the government introduced the revised pilot in eight additional districts. Further expansion has&#13;
been on hold due to recent institutional changes in the government and required project restructuring,&#13;
although preparations are underway to add 25 more districts by the end of 2014.&#13;

Farm restructuring activity has again speeded up, with noteworthy progress achieved in Sughd Oblast&#13;
in the first six months of 2014. The total number of land certificates issued has reached 79,735; about&#13;
8,000 certificates were issued in Sughd alone in the last six months.&#13;
&#13;
The State Unitary Enterprise for the Registration of Immovable Property (SUERIP) has moved forward&#13;
in its development by clarifying that it is institutionally situated under the State Land Committee. It has&#13;
begun to appoint officials and has initiated transfer of the Bureau of Technical Inventory and Markaz&#13;
Zamin resources to SUERIP ownership. This is a major step toward a unified Tajikistan land and&#13;
property registration system.&#13;
&#13;
Pilot SUERIP registration has commenced in the districts of Kulob and Khujand. Registration offices&#13;
have been opened, technology installed, and staff engaged and trained on the registration system. Work&#13;
is now commencing in these two sites on merging the data from the Markaz Zamin and the Bureau of&#13;
Technical Inventory and confirming them in the field to launch the integrated immovable property&#13;
registration system database.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
C.       Outlook	&#13;
&#13;
GDP	 growth	 is	 projected	 to	 ease	 to	 6.5	 percent	 in	 2014	 due	 to	 the	 spillover	 effect	 from	 the	&#13;
Russian	slowdown	and	the	feeble	performance	of	key	exports. A further slowdown in Russia would&#13;
affect Tajikistan largely through the remittances and trade channels. 15 Lower remittances would&#13;
heavily depress household demand and thus services and housing construction. Total investment&#13;
growth, however, is expected to be strong, buoyed by public spending and the launch of private&#13;
investment projects. As aluminum and cotton prices are expected to remain low in 2014, exports are&#13;
projected to decline further in dollar terms. An expected increase in global prices for aluminum and&#13;
cotton in 2015â&#128;&#147;16 along with measures to modernize and improve the energy efficiency of TALCO&#13;
would result in a modest recovery for these two exports, though from a very low 2014 base. Inflation is&#13;
projected to end the period at 7 percent as a result of the pass-through effect from somoni depreciation&#13;
and the rise in electricity tariffs as of July 1, 2014, but stable global food prices would help to limit&#13;
inflation to a single digit in the near term (Table 1).&#13;

Notes: a Estimates. b Projections.&#13;
&#13;
	&#13;
Even	with	economic	growth	slowing,	the	overall	budget	deficit	is	projected	to	be	unchanged	in	&#13;
2014	 before	 widening	 to	 1.5	 percent	 in	 2015. Improved revenue collection and a moderate&#13;
devaluation would help to prevent a slowing in growth from causing a substantial revenue shortfall.&#13;
Budget spending, however, is expected to grow faster in 2015â&#128;&#147;16 due to higher public investment and&#13;
projected increases in wages and pensions. The projections are based on government spending plans&#13;
for 2015â&#128;&#147;17. Some rationalization of expenditures is assumed as a result of better management of&#13;
public spending and financing reforms in key social sectors. In addition, a gradual reduction in&#13;
quasifiscal deficits (especially in the energy sector) is expected as a result of reforms in the SOE sector&#13;
supported by the World Bank Group and other development partners.&#13;
&#13;
The	current	account	deficit	is	projected	to	widen	to	3.7	percent	of	GDP	in	2014	because	of	muted	&#13;
external	 demand,	 low	 prices	 for	 aluminum,	 and	 the	 slowdown	 in	 remittances. In the medium&#13;
term, lower remittances may help to improve the trade balance by reducing imports of consumer&#13;
goods. This stabilizing impact, however, is expected to be largely offset by increased imports of capital&#13;
goods for public infrastructure projects. Export of aluminum and cotton will rebound very slowly due&#13;
to slack recovery in both prices and external demand. Most export growth is expected to come from&#13;
â&#128;&#156;other exportsâ&#128;&#157; (e.g., agriculture produce, precious metals, electricity). In the medium term, a solid&#13;
increase in the export of services (e.g., tourism) is projected as a result of improved infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
  The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s latest baseline scenario for Russia projects growth of 0.5 percent in 2014 and 0.3 percent in&#13;
both 2015 and 2016.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                  Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
(commissioning of a number of new hotels, a new airport terminal in Dushanbe, road improvements).&#13;
Overall, the current account deficit will hover around 3.8 percent of GDP for the medium term. Despite&#13;
a projected increase in foreign direct investment, remittances will continue to have the major role in&#13;
financing the large trade gap.&#13;
&#13;
There	 are	both	domestic	and	external	risks.	 The main risks to the near-term outlook relate to the&#13;
serious financial sector vulnerabilities and governance issues, fiscal risks caused by SOEs, a slower&#13;
recovery in the prices of aluminum and cotton, and a further slowdown in activity in Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s main&#13;
trading partners. There is also major uncertainty about the pace and financing of large infrastructure&#13;
projects, especially the Rogun HPP. The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous&#13;
shocks could impact the Tajikistan economy are remittances (some migrants may well return) and&#13;
external trade. The possible spillover effect from the Russian slowdown onto the Tajikistan economy is&#13;
estimated to be one of the largest in the ECA region: a 1 percentage point reduction in the growth of&#13;
Russiaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP would reduce growth in Tajikistan by the same amount.16 Strengthening fiscal and&#13;
external buffers will be critical for mitigating the impact of external shocks, particularly given&#13;
Tajikistanâ&#128;&#153;s close links with Russia and such other trading partners as Kazakhstan, Turkey, and China.&#13;
In the near term, prudent macroeconomic policies could help the country absorb the shocks, especially&#13;
allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility.&#13;

17 The EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) has been carried&#13;
out in five rounds: in 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2012/13 and covers virtually all the countries of Central and&#13;
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, as well as Turkey. The survey covers a broad range of business-&#13;
related issues. This section is based on the latest draft of 2013 BEEPS at a glance (BAAG) for Tajikistan (July 2014)&#13;
and additional contributions from the BEEPS ECA team.&#13;
18 The BEEPS team in ECA asked, â&#128;&#156;Using the response options on the card (from â&#128;&#152;no obstacleâ&#128;&#153; to â&#128;&#152;very severe&#13;
&#13;
obstacleâ&#128;&#153;), to what degree is XYZ an obstacle to the current operations of this establishment?â&#128;&#157; The team then&#13;
estimated an average score (â&#128;&#156;no obstacleâ&#128;&#157; = 0 to â&#128;&#156;very severeâ&#128;&#157; = 4) and used the average to rank countries. The&#13;
IFC team used a different approach, e.g. question M1 â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#156;By looking at the card can you tell me which of the&#13;
elements of the business environment in the list, currently represents the biggest obstacle faced by this&#13;
establishment?â&#128;&#157; and then took the percentage of firms that checked any of the obstacles on the list.&#13;

The	 percentage	 of	 firms	 reporting	 that	 access	 to	 finance	 is	 not	 an	 obstacle	 went	&#13;
up	4.4		percentage	points	and	of	firms	perceiving	financing	as	a	major	or	severe	obstacle	went	&#13;
up	1	percentage	point.	 Perceptions, however, vary by sector: the percentage of manufacturing firms&#13;
reporting â&#128;&#156;no obstacleâ&#128;&#157; has not changed, but the percentage perceiving financing as a major or very&#13;
severe obstacle went up trend from 25 to 28 percent. Similarly, in 2008 13.6 percent of&#13;
large companies (annual sales over $1 million) perceived access to finance as a major obstacle but in&#13;
2013 the percentage had shot up to 19.7 percent. Furthermore, in 2008 only 5 percent of firms&#13;
reported the complexity of the application process as the main reason for not applying for a loan, but in&#13;
2013 9 percent did so. Firms using bank credit for financing went from 11 percent in 2008 to 5 percent&#13;
in 2013. The percentage of firms reporting high interest rates as a reason for not applying for a loan&#13;
went down between 2008 and 2013 but was still higher in Tajikistan than in Kazakhstan and&#13;
Uzbekistan (Figure 21).&#13;

&amp;#12;Tajikistan: Moderated Growth, Heightened Risks&#13;
&#13;
While	firm	views	on	foreign	trade	continue	to	be	relatively	favorable,	Tajikistan	needs	to	make	&#13;
its	exports	more	competitive.	Customs and trade regulations are not a serious issue for the firms and&#13;
some reported bribes at customs were less frequent. While dealing with customs is easier, only a&#13;
minuscule share of Tajikistan firms are engaged in direct export, and the number went down between&#13;
surveys from 4 to 3 percent of the sample. For a small open economy other worrisome trends that point&#13;
to a stagnation of export sectors and increasing concentration of exports are that (1) there was a&#13;
substantial drop in firms that export (from 45 in 2008 to 28 in 2013); (2) economy-wide export sales&#13;
are virtually unchanged, but mainly because one large company increased its exports; and (3)&#13;
countrywide, a smaller percentage of sales are coming from exports even though exporting firms report&#13;
that a larger portion of their own sales come from exports.&#13;
&#13;
Other	observations	from	the	first	round	of	analysis	of	2013	BEEPs	for	Tajikistan	are	these:	&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The perceived frequency of unofficial payments has gone down in all three major areas of&#13;
        business-government interactions (taxes and tax collections; customs and imports; and courts).&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Participation in government procurement went up but kick-backs held steady at the same level.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   â&#128;&#152;Time taxâ&#128;&#153; is on rise (as in other Central Asian economies) and the percentage of firms that&#13;
        spent more than 25 percent of management time dealing with public officials or public services&#13;
        in Tajikistan went up from 14 percent in 2008 to 25 percent in 2013. The percentage of&#13;
        senior management time spent dealing with public officials or public services went up from 16&#13;
        to 27 percent.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   There have been noticeable improvements in specific government-business interaction: firms&#13;
        spend less time waiting and fewer of them pay bribes to secure licenses, utility connections, and&#13;
        construction permits.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The quality of most services has improved; it now takes less time to obtain a service in&#13;
        Tajikistanâ&#128;&#148;with the single exception of import licenses.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Although 59 percent of respondents still experienced electricity outages in the 12 months&#13;
        leading to the survey, sales losses due to outages went down.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Labor skills and quality are also becoming less of an obstacle to current operations. The&#13;
        percentage of employees with a university degree reached 41 percent (compared to 9 percent&#13;
        in Slovenia and 27 percent in Latvia). Also, 67 percent of production employees participated in&#13;
        training, more than double the percentage in 2008.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Development of new products and R&amp;D spending are down, as they are in the rest of Central&#13;
        Asia.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Significantly more firms perceive that state capture has moderate or higher impact on&#13;
        businesses at all levels.&#13;
Further analysis of the new data should provide important insights into the business environment in&#13;
Tajikistan and analytical underpinnings for the continuing dialogue on structural reform and for the&#13;
future budget support	series. 	&#13;

            Tajikistan : Moderated growth, heightened risks
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Tajikistan&#146;s economic growth moderated
            to 6.7 percent in the first half of 2014 from 7.5 percent a
            year earlier as activity slowed in almost all sectors.
            Weaker world economic growth and lower prices for cotton and
            aluminum adversely affected the major export-oriented
            industries, pushing total industrial growth below 3 percent
            from nearly 7 percent a year earlier. Lower inflows of
            remittances due to the slowdown in Russia have translated
            into lower domestic demand and slower growth in services and
            housing construction. Though growth in agricultural output
            also moderated due to heavy rains and low temperatures, it
            was still a healthy 6 percent. Inflation began to pick up as
            food prices rose and tariffs for utilities were adjusted,
            reaching 4.7 percent for the first half of 2014 compared to
            1.6 percent a year earlier. However, fixed investment grew
            swiftly as the public investment program got underway. GDP
            growth is projected to ease to 6.5 percent in 2014 because
            of the spillover effect from the slowdown in Russia and in
            export sales. A Russian slowdown affects Tajikistan largely
            through the remittances channel. A slackening in remittances
            weighs heavily on household demand, notably demand for
            services and housing construction. Inflation pressures are
            expected to increase but stable global food prices should
            help to keep growth in inflation within a single digit.
            Despite slower economic growth the fiscal deficit is
            projected to remain unchanged in 2014 because of higher than
            expected revenues from foreign trade, reforms in revenue
            collection, and spending restraint. The current account
            deficit is projected to widen to 3.7 percent of GDP because
            of sluggish export growth and the remittance slowdown.
            Tajikistan could perhaps benefit from the Russian ban on
            import of food from the West but fragile market links,
            limited economies of scale, poor access to credit, and
            barriers to entry and expansion limit Tajik ability to
            benefit from increased Russian demand.
