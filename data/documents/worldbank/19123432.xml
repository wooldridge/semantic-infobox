&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of 16&#13;
countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted countries&#13;
to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in CSO1. The&#13;
â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis to develop the&#13;
CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance into services through&#13;
government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary assessments have been&#13;
drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever possible, the assessments&#13;
have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country sector stakeholders, including&#13;
donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund&#13;
(UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

with steady investments in water supply infrastructure over    with these dual demands of expansion and replacement.&#13;
the last 30 years, has led to a remarkable improvement in      The considerable finance gap that exists for water and&#13;
access to safe water supplies in rural and urban areas. The    sanitation means that the positive gains of the past may&#13;
use of improved sanitation has also increased, although        plateau.&#13;
at a lower rate. The Government of Uganda recognizes&#13;
that these improvements in access have not been uniform.       Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in Uganda have&#13;

The challenge to more equitable service delivery is that       performance report, has helped link decision making in&#13;
many of the poorly served areas are also difficult to          the sector to a balanced set of indicators including access&#13;

The comparatively slow rate of increase of urban and           sustaining service delivery, coupled with low anticipated&#13;
rural sanitation coverage is a reflection of the continuing    public investment that provides the genesis for the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed priority actions to tackle these challenges, and ensure finance is effectively&#13;
turned into services, are:&#13;
&#13;
 Sectorwide&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Increase the level of public finance for water service delivery and sanitation.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Further explore mechanisms to raise private finance for water supply facilities through self-supply and output-based&#13;
      aid.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Improve joint planning, implementation, and monitoring of water and environment activities.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Increase the emphasis on regulation of urban and rural water supplies.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Improve the analysis of the socioeconomic impact of particular technologies and management options in rural and&#13;
      urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Rural water supply&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Examine the extent to which replacement costs are covered in the Strategic Sector Investment Plan (SSIP).&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Revisit the viability of the relatively high-cost technology mix as set out in the SSIP.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Explore a range of management and maintenance options for small piped water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Urban water supply&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Analyze the reasons for the differences between Uganda Bureau of Statistics and Ministry of Water and Environment&#13;
    access data.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Examine the financial viability of piped water supplies in small towns.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Report fully on the performance of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation and the Water Authorities in the&#13;
    Annual Sector Performance Measurement Report.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Ensure that the need for safe water for the poor is balanced with the need to recover costs, or publicly support the&#13;
    operation and maintenance of piped water supplies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Rural sanitation and hygiene&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Report on sanitation activities, outputs, and outcomes in line with the Integrated Sanitation and Hygiene strategy.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Show the extent to which sanitation initiatives (promotion, enforcement of by-laws, capacity-building of the private&#13;
    sector) lead to outcomes.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Report more fully on the activities and outcomes of activities undertaken by the other stakeholders in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Urban sanitation and hygiene&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Report on sanitation activities, outputs, and outcomes in line with the Integrated Sanitation and Hygiene strategy.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Increase emphasis on the improvement of existing facilities, not just on the construction of new facilities.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Explore additional ways of encouraging urban councils and town boards to enforce by-laws.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	   Develop a framework for collaboration between Kampala City Council, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation,&#13;
      private cesspool emptiers, and consumers under the auspices of those who govern sanitation in Uganda (Ministry of&#13;
      Water and Environment and Ministry of Health).&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what its member&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This CSO2 report has&#13;
been produced in collaboration with the Government of Uganda (GoU) and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

A 10-year ISH Promotion Financing Strategy was launched          in the way financial resources are obtained, allocated, and&#13;
in 2006; 2009 witnessed the release of the consolidated          disbursed.&#13;
SSIP for water supply and sanitation. In the case of urban&#13;

water and all sanitation targets are in line with national       stronger institutions, the GoU and its donors have sought&#13;
targets. The SSIP is accompanied by a detailed Strategic         to align and harmonize their modalities of cooperation. In&#13;
Sector Investment Model which provides estimates of              the water and sanitation sector, there is a strong drive to&#13;

to the GoU consolidated fund and then remitted to                MoH are not published. It is thus not possible to relate&#13;
the district local governments as the District Water and         public expenditure on sanitation to outcomes. Details of&#13;

In the case of rural sanitation, however, planning, funding,     spending.&#13;

fragmented with activities undertaken under various              rural context transparent allocation criteria are used to&#13;

Rural water coverage in Uganda stood at 64 percent in                   existing facilities is also an aspect that needs to be taken&#13;

MDG target, of 70 percent (based on JMP coverage data),                 is not clear.&#13;
and the national government target of 77 percent, based&#13;
on MoWE coverage data, the reality is that future funding               Figure 9 shows that anticipated investments of US$27&#13;
is grossly inadequate. The expected future technology                   million per year for rural water supply are nowhere&#13;

that the per capita investment requirement (based on SSIP&#13;

per year) is not particularly high for the region. Thus it is&#13;
the technology mix rather than the individual technologies&#13;

            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in
            over 30 countries across SSA. This CSO2 report has been
            produced in collaboration with the Government of Uganda and
            other stakeholders during 2009-10. The analysis aims to help
            countries assess their own service delivery pathways for
            turning finance into water supply and sanitation services in
            each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and
            rural and urban sanitation and hygiene. The CSO2 analysis
            has three main components: a review of past coverage; a
            costing model to assess the adequacy of future investments;
            and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular
            bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway. The
            CSO2's contribution is to answer not only whether past
            trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector
            targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to
            ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated
            coverage in water supply and sanitation. In this spirit,
            specific priority actions have been identified through
            consultation. A synthesis report, available separately,
            presents best practice and shared learning to help realize
            these priority actions.
