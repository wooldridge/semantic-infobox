INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND POVERTY IN MEXICO&#13;
The recent publication of results from a household budget survey for the&#13;
first six months of 1977 sheds new light on income distribution in Mexico.&#13;
This paper reports on analysis of four such surveys, for 1963, 1968, 1975, as&#13;
well as 1977, with adjustments for consistency and comparability. According&#13;
to the results, the distribution of income has not changed much since 1963.&#13;
Thus, although incomes are distributed very unequally in Mexico and poverty&#13;
is widespread, the absolute income levels of the poorer households have risen&#13;
more or less apace with those of their richer countrymen, at an annual rate&#13;
of about 4% per year in real terms. The paper also touches on three important&#13;
sources of poverty in Mexico, (a) rapid population growth, which has resulted&#13;
in a high dependency ratio and explosive growth of the labor force; (b) neglect&#13;
of productivity in a considerable portion of agriculture and the people who&#13;
live from it; and (c) policies that biased Mexico's economic growth in ways&#13;
that reduced demand for labor. Analysis of these data continues, both in&#13;
Mexico and at the World Bank.&#13;
Special thanks are due to Gabriel Vera, without whose expert guidance and&#13;

INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND POVERTY IN MEXICO, 1963-1977&#13;
Joel Bergsman&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Mexico's problems of rapid population growth, low productivity&#13;
workers and poverty are serious, and there are no quick solutions to them.&#13;
The relevant data, which come from many different sources, are not always&#13;
in agreement, and some estimates are difficult to accept. Given more time&#13;
and access to the original data, it should be possible to put together a&#13;
more accurate and complete pizture of trends in productivity and income&#13;
distribution. Researchers at the World Bank and in Mexico are now engaged&#13;
in this task. But even without the results of such work, the broad outlines&#13;
of great inequality in productivity and in incomes, and little or no change&#13;
in distribution over the last 15 years, are unmistakable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME&#13;
Data and Sources&#13;
The main sources of data are four generally comparable household&#13;
budget surveys-,-done in-1963, 1968,_1975 and 1977. These surveys attempted&#13;
to measure total household income after direct taxes, including income&#13;
in kind, imputed income from owner-occupied dwellings, income from capital,&#13;
and transfers, as well as normal monetary income. They are all national&#13;
sample surveys. Although the concepts, methods, and reliability vary&#13;
somewhat from one survey to another, they are much more comparable than&#13;
sets of such surveys in most other LDCs, and at least three of the four&#13;
appear to be at least as reliable. Moreover, they give direct estimates of&#13;
the variables that are central to our concern, household income (rather than&#13;
individual income), and they estimate total after-tax household income,&#13;
including income in kind and various imputed components such as rent from&#13;
owner-occupied dwellings.&#13;
The reported estimates of the size distribution of income and&#13;
expenditures are shown in Table 1. A comparison between the national total&#13;
of disposable personal income (DPI) reported in the studies, and the same&#13;
variable estimated from national income accounts data, is shown in Table 2.&#13;
Among the interesting charateristics of these data are the following:&#13;
(i) At lower income levels, reported expenditure is often much&#13;
greater than reported income. In many cases the differences&#13;
seem too large to be accepted as true and due to dis-saving by&#13;
families whose income has fallen below their "permanent" income&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
(ii) The national totals for DPI implied by the household budget&#13;
studies are considerably less than that implied by national&#13;
accounts data. Moreover, the difference increases with time--i.e.&#13;
is smaller in 1963 and 1968 than in 1975 and 1977.&#13;
These characteristics suggest that income may be underestimated&#13;
by the studies, and that the degree of underestimation increased in the two&#13;
more recent studies. If this is so, then neither the situation as of one&#13;
year nor trends during the period are accurately reflected by the reported&#13;
data. Under-reporting of income seems to occur in almost all household&#13;
budget studies in all countries. It is generally thought to be mainly a&#13;
reflection of two problems: income in kind and informal transfers are thought&#13;
to be accidentally underestimated, and informants are thought to deliberately&#13;
under-report. The first problem is presumably concentrated in the lower por-&#13;
tion of the income spectrum; the second may well occur among informants at&#13;
all income levels although many scholars believe it to be concentrated (in&#13;
amount if not in percentage of informants) among those with higher income.&#13;
Three different sets of adjustments to the reported data for&#13;
various years are known to the author. Their results are shown in Table 3.&#13;
Navarrete worked with data for 1950, 1958 and 1963. (Earlier work by the&#13;
same author is not discussed here, on the assumption that her later publica-&#13;
tion supercedes the earlier one.) Felix made estimates going back to the&#13;
nineteenth century, relied on Navarrete for 1950 and 1957, and made his own&#13;
adjustments for 1963, 1968, and 1975; only the three latest years are dis-&#13;
cussed here. Altimir made adjustments for 1963 and 1968.&#13;

All three scholars relied on estimates from the national accounts&#13;
for the total amount of household income in each year (Altimir not completely,&#13;
as explained below), and hence for estimates of changes over time in the&#13;
totals. Even here, however, they differ to some extent because disposable&#13;
household income is not reported in the national income accounts and was&#13;
estimated differently by each author. But their major differences lie in&#13;
how the shortfalls were distributed across income classes.&#13;
Navarrete made a two-step adjustment. (See Navarrete, 1970, and&#13;
Altimir, 1979, for full explanations.) She first increased the reported&#13;
income of those classes that reported net dis-saving-by the class as a whole,&#13;
to take into account presumed under-reporting of income in kind, gifts,&#13;
transfers, and sporadic income. She then increased the reported income of&#13;
those classes that reported net saving. The total of this second increase&#13;
was such as to equate the total over all households with her estimate from&#13;
the national income accounts, and it was distributed proportionally to the&#13;
average income of each class so adjusted. As Felix and Altimir have pointed&#13;
out, this distribution is not only arbitrary in concept, but also depends&#13;
on the structure of disaggregation in the reported data. Given the way in&#13;
which the results were originally reported, the adjustment distributes very&#13;
large shares of the total discrepancy to the highest income classes because,&#13;
since they covered only a small part of the very top of the distribution,&#13;
they had very high average incomes.&#13;
Felix also made a two-step adjustment, conceptually similar to&#13;
Navarrete's. First he raised the income of the lowest 20% to 90% of its&#13;
reported consumption and that of the second 20% to 92% of its reported&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

consumption. The second step was to allocate the remaining gap between&#13;
the (partly adjusted) survey totals and the national income accounts totals&#13;
to the upper 60% of all households. Felix followed Navarrete in distribut-&#13;
ing the total proportionately to the average income of each income bracket.&#13;
Felix notes that this adjustment is arbitrary, and that it implies an in-&#13;
come elasticity of under-reporting greater than one (because the number of&#13;
households in each bracket decreases as the average income increases).l/&#13;
Altimir takes a different approach. After detailed and careful&#13;
analysis of what the various causes of the gaps may be, and of how Navarrete&#13;
and Felix approached the problem, he concludes that the best method is to&#13;
adjust separately each component of income: wages and salaries, business&#13;
income, income from capital, and transfers. But because he did not have&#13;
access to all the necessary data, he disaggregates families by socio-economic&#13;
class and income size class. The correction factor for each group is a&#13;
weighted average of ratios of income as estimated by the national accounts&#13;
to income as estimated in the survey, and the weights are the incomes of&#13;
the given type for that group, as estimated in the survey. For income&#13;
from property, the discrepancy was distributed only to the top 20% of&#13;
all households. For income from wages and salaries, the survey estimates&#13;
exceeded the national account estimates and no adjustment was made. For&#13;
other types of incomes, the discrepancy was distributed proportionally&#13;
to income as estimated by the surveys.&#13;
In the judgment of the present author, the methods of Navarrete&#13;
and Felix (which conceptually are the same and in practice are rather&#13;
similar) are not acceptable. Their more serious weakness is the totally&#13;
1/   "Income elasticity of under-reporting" is the slope of a log-linear&#13;
regression of adjusted income on reported income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
arbitrary nature of the adjustment at the upper end. This adjustment depends&#13;
not only on arbitrary assumptions about under-reporting (which are unavoid-&#13;
able) but also on the particular grouping by income size class (which is&#13;
not unavoidable and which, as used, assigns almost all the discrepancy to&#13;
the highest classes). Another aspect that seems hard to justify is the assump-&#13;
tion that only low-income and high-income households under-report, while&#13;
middle-income households report accurately and honestly. I see no reason&#13;
to assume that middle-income families are especially accurate in their&#13;
estimates of their income or especially honest in their reporting of it.&#13;
Comparisons of reported income and reported consumption in the micro data,&#13;
reported by Altimir, suggest under-reporting at all income levels. Altimir's&#13;
logic and method seem far superior; however, his results seem dubious in&#13;
two respects: for the lowest decile in 1968 his adjustments seem to have&#13;
reduced the average income,l/ and in general the overall income elas-&#13;
ticity of under-reporting implied by his results is rather high, especially&#13;
in 1968 (see Table 3).&#13;
In deciding how to deal with the adjustment question, I was guided&#13;
by the following ideas:&#13;
(i) Some adjustment seems to be required. Inter-year comparisons&#13;
based on unadjusted survey results would be strongly biased&#13;
(showing more of a downward trend in incomes than is likely&#13;
to have occurred); even in one year it seems clear that the&#13;
reported survey results miss a lot of income.&#13;
l/   This result is, I think, logically impossible.   It may be caused by a&#13;
mistake in Altimir's calculations, in the typing of his paper, or in&#13;
my calculations based on his work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(ii) In the absence of new information about under-reporting,&#13;
any adjustment is arbitrary. Navarrete, Felix and Altimir&#13;
agree.&#13;
(iii)  I have access only to the published results, plus a few&#13;
special tabulations for 1975. Hence I could not hope to do&#13;
as well as Altimir has done for 1963 and 1968, nor anything&#13;
as good for 1975 and 1977.&#13;
In this quandary I have opted for simplicity and conservatism. I&#13;
do not even attempt to estimate "the" distributions, but rather make two&#13;
sets of estimates for each year, one tending to overestimate inequality and&#13;
the other tending to underestimate it, with the idea that the truth is pro-&#13;
bably somewhere in between. Each estimate adjusts total income to the level&#13;
implied by the national accounts; the "low inequality" estimate, called&#13;
method 1, assumes an income elasticity of under-reporting equal to 0.95&#13;
while the "high inequality" estimate, called method 2, uses a value of 1.20.&#13;
The two elasticities more or less span the range of those implied in the&#13;
Navarrete, Felix, and Altimir adjustments. (In method 2, straightforward&#13;
application of the elasticity of 1.20 results in reducing the average incomes&#13;
of the lower-income groups; in such cases the added restriction that adjusted&#13;
income be at least as great as reported income for each class was applied;&#13;
therefore, in the final results the overall elasticity of under-reporting&#13;
turns out to be less than 1.20.)&#13;
In my estimates, reported in Table 4, the first step was to esti-&#13;
mate decile distributions from the reported data for 1963, 1968, and 1975.&#13;
(For 1977 the decile distribution was reported.) This was done by inter-&#13;
polating log-linearly, for each decile point on the cumulative distributions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
between the two reported points on either side of the decile point.       (For&#13;
1963, the first reported point is above the first decile, and hence a rough&#13;
approximation was made by freehand drawing of a graph.)        The piece-wise&#13;
log-linear interpolation seems to match the shape of the theoretical Pareto&#13;
curve fairly well, while also being simple to do and giving minimal diver-&#13;
gence from actual observations.-' (We had two different groupings from the&#13;
1975 survey.    We used log-linear interpolation from one to estimate the&#13;
other, and the results were very close to the actuals.)&#13;
The second step was to apply the two different assumed elasticities&#13;
of under-reporting to the estimated decile distributions.     The results are&#13;
presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6.&#13;
The results of the 1975 survey--both before and after adjustments--&#13;
seem strange.    They imply sharp drops in the shares of the lower income&#13;
classes, even in their absolute income levels (see Tables 4 and 6).        All&#13;
three measures of inequality jump sharply from the 1968 levels. Then, the&#13;
1977 results imply a rapid restoration to a distribution similar to that of&#13;
1968. Under adjustment method 2 the real income of the lowest 40% drops 15%&#13;
from the 1968 level, then rises 49% in the two years to 1977. The share of&#13;
the lowest 20%, a less reliable measure, shows even more drastic and unlikely&#13;
behavior under both adjustment methods, dropping between 27% and 46% from&#13;
1968 to 1975 and then rising between 82% and 97% from 1975 to 1977.      These&#13;
1/     Note that in Kalifa's estimates, reported in Kalifa (1977) and in&#13;
Hernandez and Cordoba (1979) a linear interpolation was used.         Not&#13;
only does this method give a less smooth Lorenz curve, in a few cases&#13;
it results in identical estimates for average household income in two&#13;
adjacent deciles, which is nonsense.&#13;

reported changes may in part reflect the truth; 1975 was a year of high in-&#13;
flation and a slight drop (0.7%) in crop production. The shares of low in-&#13;
come households may well have dropped, and even their absolute incomes may&#13;
have fallen. But the magnitude of the reported changes is very hard to&#13;
accept. The 1975 survey was somewhat lower quality than those of 1968 and&#13;
1977, in terms of sample size and training of enumerators, and there was&#13;
also some greater imprecision in the definition of the concepts of income.&#13;
For all these reasons, we conclude that the drastic changes implied by the&#13;
1975 results were probably in small part actual but short-run, and in large&#13;
part due to errors in the survey. Therefore, most of our subsequent analysis&#13;
is based on the (adjusted) results of the other three surveys.&#13;
Inequality&#13;
Income in Mexico is distributed very unequally. The share of the&#13;
poorest 40% of households is between 8 and 12% of the total. This is&#13;
probably lower than the 11.5% "expected" on the basis of cross-country&#13;
patterns (see Chart 1).!/ It is lower than in at least 9 (or at most 13)&#13;
of 16 other less-developed countries for which data are presented in the&#13;
World Development Report for 1979; only in Honduras, Peru, and Brazil is the&#13;
share clearly lower than in Mexico.!/ The ratio of the share of the highest&#13;
20% to the share of the lowest 20% is similarly higher than in most other&#13;
countries.&#13;
Changes in inequality in Mexico since 1963 have been small or nil.&#13;
Disregarding the questionable data for 1975, the three different measures&#13;
of inequality shown in Table 6 show no significant trend or changes when&#13;
considered together. The decile structure has changed but little, although&#13;
1/   "Expected" values calculated by the author from results reported in&#13;
Ahluwalia (1976), Table 3.&#13;
2/   More recent estimates for Brazil suggest slightly less inequality&#13;
there, but still more than the present estimates for Mexico. I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
there has probably been some increase in the share of middle income groups&#13;
at the expense of the upper and lower income groups (see Table 4).&#13;
This conclusion about no significant change in the d1istribution&#13;
does not appear to be subject to the problem of under-reporting and how&#13;
to distribute the unreported income (discussed earlier). There is no&#13;
significant change in distribution in any of our three sets of estimates--&#13;
the unadjusted and the two differently adjusted ones. Thus, the conclusion&#13;
stands regardless of *how the unreported income was distributed, as long&#13;
as that distribution was more or less similar in each of the three surveys.&#13;
This last assumption seems very likely to be true; whatever the reasons&#13;
for under-reporting were, there is no reason to think that they changed from&#13;
1963 to 1977.&#13;
Poverty&#13;
Many Mexicans still live in dire poverty, as anyone who knows&#13;
the country can attest. However, the rise in per capita incomes in the&#13;
nation as a whole, combined with the more or less unchanged share of the&#13;
lowest 40% increased the real income of that stratum considerably--perhaps&#13;
70 or 80% from 1963 to 1977, an annual rate of around 4% per year (see&#13;
Table 6).&#13;
This estimate of 4% per year is considerably higher than the&#13;
growth in GDP per capita, estimated by the Banco de Mexico to have risen&#13;
at 2.7% per year over the same period. The 4% is derived from unofficial&#13;
estimates by Banco de Mexico staff of disposable personal income at current&#13;
prices, deflated by the consumer price index since 1968 and a linked whole-&#13;
sale price index from 1963 to 1968, and divided by World Bank staff esti-&#13;
mates of population. The difference between the 4 and the 2.7 is due to two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
factors: (a) the GDP deflator rose more rapidly than the consumer price index&#13;
and (b) World Bank population estimates are lower than official Mexican&#13;
estimates for years since 1970 (the last census), because the official&#13;
Mexican figures apparently make no allowance for emigration. The difference&#13;
in price deflators accounts for about four-fifths of the total discrepancy&#13;
and the difference in population estimates accounts for about one-fifth.&#13;
The greater rise in the GDP deflator is reasonable; many consumer prices&#13;
were controlled in 1977 and hence probably rose much less than the general&#13;
price level did in the mid-1970's; moreover the import substitution in inter-&#13;
mediate goods probably meant that prices of all goods rose more than prices&#13;
of consumer goods over the last 15 or 20 years. However, if the consumer&#13;
price index errs, it is probably in the direction of under-estimation&#13;
of inflation; moreover, the controlled prices of 1977 conceal inflationary&#13;
pressures that will probably make themselves felt in the future. Therefore,&#13;
the estimates of real income growth presented here may err on the high&#13;
side.&#13;
Taking the 1977 minimum wage as a poverty line, the percentage&#13;
and even the absolute number of households whose incomes fell below the&#13;
line have been decreasing (see table 6). As of 1977, only 20 to 30% of&#13;
all households earned less than the minimum wage.&#13;
The World Bank conventionally considers an income equal to one-&#13;
third the national average as a "relative poverty" line. It turns out&#13;
that such an income, in 1977, was close to the minimum wage. The percentage&#13;
of households with income less than one-third the national average was&#13;
between 23 and 34% in 1977.&#13;

II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POOR&#13;
Unfortunately, disaggregated information relating to total dispos-&#13;
able household income from the 1977 survey only became available after this&#13;
paper was substantially completed; analyzing the data will take some addi-&#13;
tional time. We did have some descriptions based on the 1975 survey, and&#13;
present them here. Even though the 1975 survey seems less accurate than the&#13;
others, we may learn something from what it tells us about poor families.&#13;
In 1975 the largest number of "poor" Mexican families--52%-were&#13;
in the agricultural sector (see Table 7).l/ Of these, 33% are listed as&#13;
self-employed--presumably ejidatarios and other small proprietors--while&#13;
18.5% are listed as salaried--presumably landless agricultural workers.&#13;
Thus the most important single group of the poor are land-owning peasants--&#13;
1.5 million families--and the second most important are the even less&#13;
fortunate landless rural workers--850,000 families. These 2.4 million&#13;
families are the core of Mexican poverty. They include 76% of all families&#13;
in agriculture in Mexico.&#13;
1/   "Poor" families were defined in this source as those households with&#13;
incomes less than half of the estimated national mean-Mex$1,621 per&#13;
month, equivalent in purchasing power to approximately US$1,315 per&#13;
year per family. This cut-off point classified some 4.6 million&#13;
Mexican families--45% of total--as "Poor". This is a rather larger&#13;
number than we would choose; both the higher cut-off criterion and the&#13;
apparently exaggerated extent of poverty in the 1975 survey contribute&#13;
to the difference. Characteristics such as sector, occupation, and&#13;
education refer to the head of the household.&#13;

The sectoral structure of Mexican poverty has not changed much&#13;
since 1963. The percentage distribution by sector of "poor" families in&#13;
1963 was virtually identical to that in 1975; in 1963 agriculture accounted&#13;
for 54.5%. In 1963 there were proportionally more landless workers and&#13;
fewer of those who owned land (see Table 8). If these data are correct, they&#13;
reflect a failure of Mexico's land redistributions during the period to&#13;
improve the incomes of its beneficiaries.&#13;
Families whose head is not working account for only 12% of the&#13;
"poor"--about 5% of all families--and their average incomes, while low,&#13;
are one-fourth again as much as those of the poor employed in agriculture.&#13;
This confirms the often-repeated idea that the poorest Mexicans cannot&#13;
afford to be unemployed. Other important sectoral-occupational&#13;
concentrations of the poor are both self-employed and salaried workers in&#13;
manufacturing and construction.&#13;
Tables 9 through 11 give more details on characteristics of poor&#13;
families in Mexico, as estimated by the 1975 survey. Among the urban poor&#13;
about two-thirds of income is from wages and salaries, and about 20% from&#13;
their own business; for the rural poor self-employment is just as important&#13;
as wages and salaries; each accounts for about 45% of income (Table 9).&#13;
Heads of poor families have very little formal education, especially in&#13;
rural areas where 55% had no school at all and another 30% more had less&#13;
than 4 years. Overall, more than three-quarters of the heads of poor&#13;
families had less than 4 years of schooling (Table 10).1/&#13;
1/   These percentages are probably over-estimates, because some households&#13;
without any adult male name the oldest male as head of household. Thus,&#13;
for example, a 2 year old boy, obviously without any schooling, could&#13;
be named as head of household.&#13;

Over half of all poor families are headed by agricultural workers.&#13;
15% are in industries or handicrafts, only 10% are service workers, and 12%&#13;
describe themselves as without occupation. Thus, according to the 1975&#13;
survey, the service sector does not account for a large share of poverty&#13;
in Mexico; even among the urban poor only about one-fourth are in services&#13;
(Table 11).&#13;
Studies based on the 1968 and the 1975 surveys have identified&#13;
education of the head of household as the variable most closely associated&#13;
with income differences. For 1968, van Ginnekin (n.d.) performed a decom-&#13;
position analysis of the Theil index of inequality. He found that of five&#13;
possible variables, the one accounting for the largest share of observed&#13;
inequality in incomes was inequality in education.   Urban/rural location&#13;
was second in importance, occupation and sector were about tied for third&#13;
place, and age was a distant last. For 1975, Vargas and Vera (n.d.) used&#13;
a very different technique, the "automatic interaction detector," and also&#13;
found education the dominant variable associated with income differences.&#13;
Urban-rural location and number of workers per household were also important;&#13;
neither age, sex, sector, or occupational status of the head of household&#13;
was significant.&#13;
The statistical importance of the education variable is common to&#13;
such data in most countries; it does not tell us to what degree more school-."&#13;
ing is a cause of higher income, or simply a concommitant. More interesting&#13;
is the lack of importance of the age variable; this is consistent with&#13;
Felix's (1979) conclusions that mobility of workers is low in Mexico, and&#13;
that therefore comparisons of different point-in-time distributions of&#13;

income may not seriously understate actual increases in income of the&#13;
particular families whose income was low in the initial year. Finally, the&#13;
relatively small effects of both sector and occupation reflect the duality--&#13;
or better, the dispersion of incomes within broad occupational and sectoral&#13;
categories. There are rich farmers and poor farmers, middle-income salaried&#13;
workers and poor salaried workers, etc.&#13;
Table 12 shows the expenditures of poor families. Not sur-&#13;
prisingly, about half are on food and the lion's share of the rest are on&#13;
housing and clothing. However, all other items than these three account for&#13;
about 20% of expenditures; not a very small amount for what are largely&#13;
discretionary expenditures.&#13;

III. SOME CAUSES OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY&#13;
Even though a fully satisfactory analysis of the causes of the&#13;
situation just described is beyond our reach, we want to explore some of the&#13;
more obvious factors that lie behind Mexican poverty and inequality. These&#13;
are to be found in three related processes: (a) rapid population growth,&#13;
especially since about 1950, with a resulting high dependency ratio and a&#13;
rapid growth of the labor force; (b) neglect of the productive capacity&#13;
of many agricultural laborers and owners of poor land, (including many&#13;
ejiditarios) who now comprise over 2 million of Mexico's 11 million families&#13;
and some three-fourths of all Mexicans engaged in agriculture; (c) policies&#13;
that made capital equipment cheaper and labor more expensive than would&#13;
otherwise have been the case.&#13;
Rapid Population Growth 1/&#13;
Since 1950, Mexico has experienced remarkable demographic growth.&#13;
Life expectancy increased from about 51 years in 1950 to 64 years in 1975.&#13;
The decline in mortality was not offset by any fall in fertility until the&#13;
mid-1970s, and consequently the population grew by about 3.4X per year&#13;
during the 1960s and about 3.3% in the early 1970s. Although crude birth&#13;
rates and total fertility rates remained high through the mid-1970s, re-&#13;
cently released data indicate that the crude birth rate has declined from 45&#13;
per thousand in 1970 to about 40.6 per thousand by mid-1976,2/ and may have&#13;
declined still further since then.&#13;
1/   This section is mostly taken from Pierce (1978).&#13;
2/   Estimates by El Colegio de Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
The decline in mortality and the persistence of high fertility&#13;
through the mid-1970s produced a markedly young population. Between 1950&#13;
and 1970, the median age declined by almost two years to 16.6 years; by 1970&#13;
about 47% of the population was below 15 years of age. These changes in age&#13;
structure have brought about a sharp increase in the dependent population.&#13;
The age dependency ratio rose from 85.6 in 1950 to 100.0 in 1970. The large&#13;
proportion of the population under age 15 poses serious problems for the&#13;
country's capacity to educate these young people and to absorb them into the&#13;
labor force.&#13;
The population of working age (12 years and over) expanded at a&#13;
much slower pace than total population in the period 1950-1970, but somewhat&#13;
more rapidly than it since 1970, because the large cohorts born during the&#13;
earlier decades are now reaching working age. The labor force itself grew&#13;
more slowly than the population of working age (and hence even more slowly&#13;
than total population) from 1950 to 1969, as participation rates dropped&#13;
sharply during these two decades. The labor force expanded at an annual&#13;
rate of 2.0% from 1950 to 1960, 2.7% from 1960 to 1969, and currently&#13;
seems to be expanding at a rate of over 3% even after deducting rough&#13;
"guesstimates" for emigration.&#13;
Rural Poverty&#13;
Land reform in Mexico dates from the revolution of 1910, but&#13;
proceeded fastest in the Cardenas period (1935-41), when massive land&#13;
redistributions were made, input and credit needs of ejidatarios were&#13;
recognized, and ejidos were organized. After Cardenas, land distribution&#13;
continued at a reduced pace, and most of its beneficiaries were given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
little in the way of credit and other inputs. Rather, emphasis shifted to&#13;
large-scale irrigated farming, and to industrialization. From 1942 to 1969,&#13;
government investment in the rural sector was concentrated on roads and on&#13;
regional river basin and other irrigation programs which focused on building&#13;
large dams and other infrastructure. Agricultural research and extension&#13;
were devoted (very successfully) to large-scale irrigated agriculture, while&#13;
better seeds and techniques for rainfed agriculture were never attempted.&#13;
Nevertheless, from 1940 through the mid-1960s the demand for&#13;
labor in agriculture grew fairly rapidly. Using a technical labor/output&#13;
coefficient approach, Rendon (1976) estimates that the demand for labor in&#13;
agriculture grew 3.1% a year during 1940-1960. This growth was due to two&#13;
basic trends: a massive increase in irrigation, both on new land and on&#13;
already cultivated land, increased both the need for labor per acre and the&#13;
number of acres under cultivation, and land redistribution also resulted&#13;
both in bringing previously fallow acreage under cultivation and in greater&#13;
labor use per acre. A rate of increase of labor requirements of 3.1% per&#13;
year would have been about equal to the rate of natural increase of the&#13;
rural population (for the nation as a whole, population grew at 2.9% per&#13;
year over the period); meanwhile employment in non-agriculture activities&#13;
was increasing at 4.8% per year, providing considerable employment for&#13;
emigrants from rural areas. So while there was almost certainly some rural&#13;
under-employment in 1940, and many peasants had little or no land, the&#13;
pressures of population on the land at least did not increase in the 1940-&#13;
1960 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
This picture changed around the mid-1960s. Rendon's estimate of&#13;
growth in labor required in agriculture falls to 1.4% per year during&#13;
1960-1973, and even this period included a few years of faster growth at the&#13;
start of the period. Meanwhile population growth accelerated (3.3% per year&#13;
nationwide, between 1960 and 1975). In agriculture, the great land redis-&#13;
tributions were all in the past, neither total acreage nor acreage under&#13;
irrigation increased as rapidly, and hence the pressure of population on the&#13;
land increased. The average number of days worked by agricultural laborers&#13;
decreased, as did average annual incomes, in the 1950s and the 1960s.&#13;
Landless workers worked an average of 190 days per year in 1950 and 100 days&#13;
per year in 1960 (CIDA, 1970). Comparable figures are not available for&#13;
1970 but another study estimated that 84% of agricultural workers worked&#13;
less than half of the available days, which suggests that the 1970 average&#13;
was still lower than that of 1960. (Hewitt de Alcantara, 1976, p. 133.)&#13;
The average real income from agriculture of landless agricultural laborers&#13;
was estimated at 850 pesos per month in 1950, 700 in 1960-62, and 499 in&#13;
1969 (at 1950 prices).l/ We may speculate that many rural families compen-&#13;
sated (in unknown degree) for the declining opportunities in agriculture by&#13;
part-time work in other sectors, including Mexican service and industrial&#13;
jobs as well as temporary migration to the United States.&#13;
We are not in a position to evaluate how easy or how difficult&#13;
a task it would have been to increase the productivity, and the incomes,&#13;
of Mexico's rural poor. We don't know what would have been necessary, how&#13;
1/   The last number is roughly consistent with the results of the 1968&#13;
household budget study, which estimated the total family income for&#13;
rural families headed by "jornaleros" at 774 pesos per month (at 1968&#13;
prices); this amounts to about US$200 per year per capita at 1977&#13;
prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

much it would have cost, or how efficient it would have been in financial&#13;
terms. We observe only that Mexico's rural population grew very fast, that&#13;
the productivity of much of it was neglected, and that widespread poverty&#13;
was the result.&#13;
In the early 1970s, the Mexican government began to reassess&#13;
strategies for fostering growth and development in rural areas and&#13;
increased efforts to improve the lot of the rural poor. The year 1977,&#13;
which is the latest for which income distribution data are available,&#13;
probably comes too soon after the start of these programs for their eventual&#13;
full effects to be reflected in the data.&#13;
Anti-Employment Biases&#13;
The rate of creation of productive jobs was further hindered,&#13;
especially in the manufacturing sector, by economic policies that biased&#13;
production towards more capital-intensive products and processes. Promoting&#13;
import substitution of manufactures through protection against imports and&#13;
other special investment incentives, and the negative effects on exports of&#13;
manufactures, primary products and services that are inherent in such a&#13;
strategy, biased the structure of production away from more labor-intensive&#13;
products. Investment subsidies tied to capital equipment purchases, as well&#13;
as taxes and other charges related to wages, increased the bias. Inadequate&#13;
education, especially for children of poor families, held down the quality&#13;
of a large part of Mexico's labor force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Mexico achieved much of its promotion of industrial expansion by&#13;
measures that made capital equipment cheaper, while it used measures that&#13;
increase the cost of labor to achieve part of its income distribution and&#13;
other social goals. Import duties on capital goods were low, and often&#13;
waived completely. The overvalued exchange rate of the mid-1970s further&#13;
lowered the peso price of machinery and equipment. Loans for the purchase&#13;
of fixed plant and equipment were more readily available than for working&#13;
capital. These measures lowered the cost of equipment by 25 to 50%, com-&#13;
pared to what it would have been in their absence. On the wage side, the 5%&#13;
housing fund contribution, the 1% education tax and the 9 to 12% social&#13;
security tax may raise the cost of labor; the minimum wage itself raises&#13;
labor costs above a free market level in the sectors where the minimum wage&#13;
regulations are enforced. A part of these charges may be reflected in&#13;
lower nominal wages, and thus be borne by the workers. However, the net&#13;
result of the increased labor charges and the subsidies of equipment pur-&#13;
chasing is that the cost of labor, relative to the cost of equipment, was&#13;
probably about 50% greater than what it would have been in the absence of&#13;
these measures. Such a large distortion must have affected the relative&#13;
amounts of the two factors used, and was especially inappropriate in view of&#13;
the explosive growth of Mexico's labor force. (This bias has decreased&#13;
since 1977.)&#13;
Results: Productivity Differentials and Inequality of Incomes I,&#13;
The results of these three processes (rapid population growth,&#13;
neglect of the productivity of a large part of the agricultural labor force,&#13;
and a bias in favor of capital-intensive production) was to maintain or&#13;

enlarge wide differences in labor productivity among different parts of the&#13;
Mexican economy. The picture here is somewhat clouded by lack of compara-&#13;
bility among the population censuses for different years, and conflicting&#13;
information as between the population censuses and the economic (i.e.&#13;
industrial and agricultural) censuses. However, the view that emerges is&#13;
as follows.&#13;
Both in 1950 and 1969, value added per worker in Mexico's agri-&#13;
culture was less than one-third the national average.l/ The ratio between&#13;
industry and agriculture was over five to one, one of the highest for any&#13;
semi-industrialized country (Bergsman, 1979).&#13;
Sectoral figures are averages, however, and do not show the&#13;
differences in productivity within sectors. These differences are recorded&#13;
for the manufacturing and agricultural sector3 in the economic censuses.&#13;
According to the 1970 Industrial Census, value added per worker in Mexico's&#13;
manufacturing industry varied within a very wide range, from 15,290 pesos&#13;
per year in establishments with gross production below 1.5 million pesos&#13;
per year, to 124,000 pesos per year in establishments producing more than&#13;
150 million pesos annually, for an average of 52,108 pesos per year iTi all&#13;
industries. Workers' earnings also vary widely in Mexico, from an average&#13;
of 7,510 pesos per year in small establishments to an average of 39,338&#13;
pesos per year in the 200 largest ones.&#13;
The same duality exists in agriculture. As shown in Table 13, in&#13;
1968 the 7.1% of farms classified as modern produced over 4 tiaes as much&#13;
output (by value) per hectare, and 20 times as much per capita income as the&#13;
1/   If the number of workers engaged in agriculture in 1969 was seriously&#13;
underestimated, as many believe, then value added per worker in agri-&#13;
culture was even less in 1969.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
52% of farms classified as subsistence. The production per farm in the&#13;
"subsistence' sector was about US$275 per year; this was the average&#13;
income from farming for about 1.5 million families. In 1960, the largest&#13;
one-half of 1% of all farms produced one-third the output and accounted&#13;
for almost half of the increase in production since 1950. The largest 3.3%&#13;
of all holdings produced over 55% of output and accounted for 80% of the&#13;
increase in production since 1950 (Table 14). From 1960 to 1970, virtually&#13;
the nntire increase in output occurred in the largest 5% of parcels, while&#13;
the smallest 90% reported a decline in value of production in real terms&#13;
(Table 15).&#13;
In these data the intra-sectoral duality of Mexico emerges, again,&#13;
very clearly. An economist may ask whether or not Mexican workers, for the&#13;
most part, are paid their marginal productivity. Policy prescriptions may&#13;
depend in part on the answer to that question. But whether or not the&#13;
Mexican labor market is working efficiently (in economic terms), given the&#13;
present distribution of factor endowments, does not alter the fact that&#13;
worker's incomes and productivities do vary widely in Mexico--more widely&#13;
than in most other semi-industrial countries--and that in an obvious and not&#13;
very subtle way the low productivities and incomes are poverty in Mexico.&#13;
Any serious program to ameliorate poverty in Mexico must come to grips with&#13;
raising this low productivity; by what combination of increasing human&#13;
capital of the poor, their physical or financial capital, or changing the&#13;
kind -of work they do or the relative prices of what they produce--this is&#13;
the next question, which we do not go into here.&#13;

IV. MEXICAN POVERTY IN PERSPECTIVE&#13;
We have already noted that Mexico has one of the most unequal dis-&#13;
tributions of income of all LDCs -- of those 16 other countries for which&#13;
recent and roughly comparable results are available, only Brazil, Peru, and&#13;
Honduras are clearly worse (see Chart 1) -- and that Mexico's distribution&#13;
has not changed much from 1963 to 1977 (while real per capita -GDP increased&#13;
by 45%). In this brief section we touch on longer-term trends in Mexico,&#13;
the nature of poverty in Mexico as compared to other LDCs, and implications&#13;
of these facts for what might be termed the policy-determined vs. the&#13;
God-given views of inequality.&#13;
For our purposes Mexican history can be described as follows:&#13;
(i) Late nineteenth century-1910: The "Porfiriato" -- no&#13;
numerical estimates but clearly was a time of increasing&#13;
inequality.&#13;
(ii) 1910-1917: The Revolution: A great leveling, reducing&#13;
high incomes and, after its end, raising at least some&#13;
low incomes--but still no numerical estimates.&#13;
(iii) 1917-1940: Mixed policies, culminating in large-scale&#13;
redistribution under Cardenas.&#13;
(iv) 1940-present: Less redistribution; more capitalistic&#13;
growth.&#13;
Felix (1979) estimates the Gini in 1910 to have been between 0.37&#13;
and 0.55, and tends to prefer the lower value.   But even if the higher value&#13;
were correct, the implication is that inequality increased both before and&#13;
after the 1910 Revolution; the only period for which there is any reason to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
believe that inequality decreased is the Revolution itself. Incorporating&#13;
Navarrete's analysis of years since 1950, it seems that the post-Revolution&#13;
increase in inequality happened at least partly before 1950 and, at least&#13;
partly afterwards; our own work presented here suggests it leveled off by&#13;
the early 1960s.&#13;
Inequality increasing with GDP per capita, and (perhaps) levelling&#13;
off as income levels of US$750 to US$1,000 per capita were reached, fits very&#13;
nicely with the many cross-country, time-series, and other views of dis-&#13;
tribution's interactions with development. Hirschman, Kuznets, and scores&#13;
of others have noted that development does not happen everywhere at the same&#13;
time and pace.  In a country as big and as differentiated as Mexico, there-&#13;
fore, in' the early stages at least inequality will increase as development&#13;
proceeds. The latest cross-section work, by Ahluwalia (1976), reveals&#13;
essentially the same cross-country pattern, with which Mexico's apparent&#13;
experience is broadly consistent. Ironically the likely but not absolutely&#13;
clear recent levelling off of inequality in Mexico also accords with the&#13;
likely but not absolutely clear peaking of inequality shown in the Ahluwalia&#13;
results. (For a dissent on the peaking see Bacha, 1977.)&#13;
Does Mexico's apparent similarity to international patterns mean&#13;
that her highly unequal distribution was inevitable? Before we accept&#13;
such a conclusion, we must confront the facts of Taiwan and Korea, where&#13;
inequality is low and has not increased with growth. (Perhaps Korea has&#13;
just started to experience increasing inequality, in the 1970s; see Bhalla,&#13;
1979.) We must confront the results reported by Adelman and Morris (1973)&#13;
who found that a few structural and policy variables explained most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
inter-country differences in inequality in LDCs. And we must ask whether&#13;
our own preceding discussion of the effects of rapid population growth,&#13;
neglect of rainfed agriculture, and anti-labor-using biases in Mexico is&#13;
completely in error or irrelevant.&#13;
Poverty in Mexico turns out to look pretty much like poverty&#13;
in virtually every other middle-income country that has much of it. (The&#13;
very widespread poverty in low-income countries is irrelevant to this&#13;
analysis.) It is mostly in rural areas, and mostly among people who are&#13;
not only economically but also socially and usually culturally different&#13;
from their more affluent compatriots. It appears in countries that&#13;
exploited agriculture to finance industrialization, by lowering the price&#13;
of agriculture's products relative to the price of manufactures.   It appears&#13;
in "depressed areas". Brazil, Peru, Turkey and the Philippines all share&#13;
these characteristics. The few capitalist or mixed-economy middle-income&#13;
countries that have much more equal distributions, such as Korea and Taiwan,&#13;
have profited from a combination of circumstances and policies--they are&#13;
small, homogenous both culturally and geographically, have achieved vir-&#13;
tually universal literacy, have promoted agriculture as well as manufac-&#13;
turing, and not just a part of agriculture but all of it. They experienced&#13;
some sort of cataclysm (war, massive migration) and change of government&#13;
that caused or at least permitted an equalization of asset holdings before a&#13;
period of rapid growth. They held down wages in the modern urban sector, and&#13;
adopted foreign trade policies that also led to absorption of very large&#13;
portions of labor force growth in that sector. (See Bergsman, 1979 for more&#13;
details.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Mexico was not so fortunate as these few countries where incomes&#13;
are much more equally distributed. Her heterogenous society, large expanses&#13;
of farmland without access to adequate and reliable water supply, rapid&#13;
population growth, and other conditions made more equality difficult to&#13;
achieve. But neither was Mexican policy so equalizing as those other coun-&#13;
tries that, whether concerned about equality or not, educated all their&#13;
people, distributed their land equally, supported small farmers with&#13;
research, technical assistance, credit, and favorable terms of trade, and&#13;
set relative prices that induced rapid absorption of labor in manufacturing.&#13;
Development indeed does not occur everywhere at the same time and at the&#13;
same pace; Mexico could hardly have hoped to achieve the degree of equality&#13;
in Taiwan but neither was inequality on the Mexican scale inevitable.&#13;

            Income distribution and poverty in Mexico
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The recent publication of results from a
            household budget survey for the first six months of 1977
            sheds new light on income distribution in Mexico. This paper
            reports on analysis of four such surveys, for 1963, 1968,
            1975, as well as 1977, with adjustments for consistency and
            comparability. According to the results, the distribution of
            income has not changed much since 1963. Thus, although
            incomes are distributed very unequally in Mexico and poverty
            is widespread, the absolute income levels of the poorer
            households have risen more or less apace with those of their
            richer countrymen, at an annual rate of about 4% per year in
            real terms. The paper also touches on three important
            sources of poverty in Mexico: (a) rapid population growth,
            which has resulted in a high dependency ratio and explosive
            growth of the labor force; (b) neglect of productivity in a
            considerable portion of agriculture and the people who live
            from it; and (c) policies that biased Mexico's economic
            growth in ways that reduced demand for labor. Analysis of
            these data continues, both in Mexico and at the World Bank.
