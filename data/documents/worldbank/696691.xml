A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
1 .    Prior to the civil war, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) had a population of about 4.4 million people,&#13;
of whom some 68 percent or 3.0 million were of employable age (15-64). Of these about 2 percent were&#13;
employed by the organized agricultural sector while a further 16 percent were private sector farmers or&#13;
farm workers. Per capita income for BH which had grown at over 5 percent p.a. in the 1970s and 2&#13;
percent p.a. in the first half of the 1980s has declined since 1986 and in 1991 was of the order of&#13;
US$1,900. Agriculture's performance was much less impressive than that of the economy as a whole&#13;
in the 1970s (annual growth of 0.6 percent compared with 5.2 percent), but it grew at 3.6 percent p.a.&#13;
in the first half of the 1980s compared with 1.9 percent p.a. for the whole economy and only fell&#13;
moderately (by an average of 1.1 percent p.a.) between 1986 and 1990. Forestry, which had grown by&#13;
about 2 percent p.a. from 1971 to 1986 has fallen sharply over the 1986-1990 period. In 1990,&#13;
agriculture's share of GSP' comprised 14 percent and that of forestry, 2 percent (see table below).&#13;
Overall, BH was a net 'importer' of temperate agricultural products. The net 'export' of livestock&#13;
products, particularly milk to the Dalmatian coast, would have been outweighed by 'imports' of grains,&#13;
and protein meals, as well as products for human consumption.&#13;

2.    Because BH is essentially rural, with only 20 percent of the population living in the 10 largest&#13;
towns prior to the war, agriculture impacts on a large proportion of households. The 1981 census&#13;
indicated that there were some 540,000 farm households. Thus, at that time, over half of all households&#13;
were agricultural. It is likely that until 1991, the situation was broadly similar.&#13;
3.    Unlike some other former Yugoslav republics, only a relatively small part of BH's agricultural&#13;
resources were in the 'social sector' - 6.1 percent of agricultural land, negligible numbers of ruminant&#13;
Within the former Yugoslavia, the measure of national income was Gross Social Product (GSP), a measure&#13;
which excludes services, except those involved in the transport and distribution of goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Paae 3 of 34&#13;
livestock, and about a quarter of the intensive livestock. Forestry, on the other hand is largely socially&#13;
owned. Over three quarters of the forest area, 88 percent of the timber stocks, 88 percent of the annual&#13;
growth increment and about 90 percent of the offtake are within the social sector. Until the late 1980s,&#13;
agro-industry of any significant scale was entirely a social sector business. Only on-farm processing such&#13;
as kitchen-scale production of meat and milk products, or local slaughtering could have been categorized&#13;
as private.&#13;
4.     Largely as a result of the war, BH's overall GSP and agriculture and forestry sector performance&#13;
have all deteriorated sharply. No reliable measures of sectoral output are available; however, since&#13;
industrial GSP fell more precipitously, agriculture's importance within the economy as a whole may have&#13;
increased. Shortly prior to the war, measures were taken to liberalize the economy by removing&#13;
restrictions on land ownership and on the number of persons which could be employed by private firms.&#13;
Additionally, some measures had also been taken to privatize the social sector units. Because of the war&#13;
situation, these measures have not yet had a significant effect on private sector expansion in agriculture&#13;
and agro-industries.&#13;
Agricultural Resources and Performance&#13;
5.     Land. BH comprises some 20 percent of the land area of former Yugoslavia. About half (2.5&#13;
million ha) of its total area of 5.11 million ha is agricultural land and a further 45 percent (2.3 million&#13;
ha) is forest. Of the agricultural land, just over 1 million ha are arable fields and gardens, about 100,000&#13;
ha are orchards and vineyards, some 470,000 ha are meadows and 930,000 ha are pastures, mainly in&#13;
mountain regions. The quality of land in BH is varied. Although some of it, around Banja Luka and&#13;
along the Sava River is relatively flat, good quality arable land, most is in hilly areas where there is&#13;
cultivation in the valley bottoms and grazing on the hillsides. Much of BH is mountainous with peaks&#13;
rising to nearly 2,400 m. However, a significant part of this mountainous land is classified as forest&#13;
rather than agricultural area. In general, the better quality arable land is in regions of the Republika&#13;
Srpska.&#13;
6.     Climate. BH is between 42 and 45 degrees North, roughly at the same latitude as Central Italy.&#13;
Mostly, its climate can be classified as continental and is affected by altitude, being particularly harsh in&#13;
the iniand mountain areas where the topography is rugged. Annual average rainfall in BH varies&#13;
depend-ng on altitude, and proximity to the coast. In central Bosnia, it is typically between 800 mm and&#13;
1,000 mm per year and distributed fairly evenly; in winter, much of the precipitation is as snow.&#13;
Towards the coast, however, the climate is more mediterranean with very limited summer rainfall, but&#13;
wet winters - Mostar has annual rainfall of about 1,500 mm, but less than 200 mm from June through&#13;
September. Temperatures in the center of Bosnia typically average 22C in July and around OC in&#13;
January; in Mostar however, they are higher at about 25C degrees in July and 5C in January. The hot&#13;
continental summers mean that parts of the country, particularly the south west, would benefit from&#13;
irrigation, although overall the amount of irrigation currently used is small. Drainage and flood&#13;
protection are important issues along the Sava River.&#13;
7.     Land ownership in BH had previously been largely private with about 94 percent of agricultural&#13;
land belonging to individuals2. As a result of the war and considerable movement of refugees, the issue&#13;
of land ownership is critical within an agricultural development strategy in the short- and medium-term.&#13;
2  The pasture area which accounts for some 37 percent of private land is thought not to be generally owned&#13;
by individual farmers but rather to belong to farmers communally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Pa,ee 4 of 34&#13;
With an average size of 3 - 5 ha, the average fann is small and largely inappropriate for modern&#13;
mechanized fanning. This is exacerbated by land fragmentation. While no direct evidence on&#13;
fragmentation in BH is available from the literature, surveys in former Yugoslavia as a whole and&#13;
observations in the neighboring Macedonia and Serbia suggest that the average farm may well have about&#13;
10 disparate parcels of land. This fragmentation is particularly constraining in the flatter areas where&#13;
mechanization would otherwise be possible. In the hill areas, farm size is typically larger than in the&#13;
plains and units are more often consolidated. The substantial movement of population which has taken&#13;
place during mnore than three years of war has caused that in many areas, people who are occupying land&#13;
are not those with legal title to it. Estimates indicate that, for the time being, up to one third of the&#13;
farmers with land title no longer occupy their own land.&#13;
8.     Private farming systems in BH are largely mixed. In 1981, there were 370,000 full time workers&#13;
on the 233,000 private farms with workers - about one worker per three hectares of cropped land.&#13;
Generally, low output mixed farming systems are followed; small areas of cereals and other crops are&#13;
produced as well as vegetables and fruit (principally plums and apples) for the household. Most farms&#13;
tend to have some livestock also, cattle being the most widely held type. Indeed, in 1981 more than&#13;
seventy percent of all private farms had at least one cow. Additionally, over half of all farms exceeding&#13;
3 ha in size, kept pigs. Sheep were less widely owned with only 20 percent of farmers owning any&#13;
sheep at all, but among these, some 24,000 farmers (about 5 percent of all farms) had at least 20 head.&#13;
SubFtantial sheep flocks are most common in areas with access to communal mountain pasture.&#13;

9.     Cropping. The agricultural land use, and the areas under different crops is summarized below.&#13;
Over the twenty years 1981-1991, the cropping pattern had changed slightly with the cereal area&#13;
decreasing but the area of forage crops increasing (see table above). Overall, about 45 percent of arable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 5 of 34&#13;
land was in cereals in 1991, with a large figure of 22 percent of the area either fallow or uncultivated&#13;
(up from 18 percent in 1971).&#13;
10.   Crop yields are typically good indicators of technical performance. The table below shows&#13;
development of BH's crop yields over time and in 1988 compares BH figures to those of Yugoslavia as&#13;
a whole. Technical performance for crop production, compared with Yugoslavia is generally poor.&#13;
Yields of cereals, which cover some 45 percent of the cropped area in BH, averaged nearly 20 percent&#13;
below those for Yugoslavia as a whole. Performance of potatoes and vegetables was relatively worse,&#13;
while clover (hay) yields were 13 percent below the national average. Only with tobacco did BH achieve&#13;
a higher average yield than Yugoslavia as a whole. Compared with western Europe, BH average yields&#13;
are only about half for cereals, potatoes and vegetables, and less than half for clover. Although BH&#13;
conditions are not ideal for the crops grown, yield levels reported on some of the more efficient units in&#13;
the past suggest there is substantial room for technical improvement.&#13;

11.   As would be expected, production of crops fell considerably as a result of the war and the&#13;
consequent reductions in available inputs. A well-organized seed distribution program which was&#13;
implemented by humanitarian relief organizations and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)&#13;
during the 1994 fall and 1995 spring planting seasons, was able to stop the continuous decline in wheat&#13;
production in Federation territory. However, 1995 production of wheat and maize continued to drop&#13;
considerably in the Republika Srpska, where the FAO program was not available, causing total 1995&#13;
grain production in BH to fall by one quarter from 1994 harvest levels.&#13;
12.   A comparison between FAO/WFP estimated production of wheat and maize in 1994 and 1995&#13;
and the official statistics for 1990 is set out in the table below. Estimates covering BH as a whole for&#13;
wheat, maize, pulses and potatoes indicate production falls of between 1991 and 1995 of 43 percent, 47&#13;
percent and 40 percent respectively. Fruit production is also estimated to be down by about 50 percent,&#13;
with 5-10 percent of trees destroyed. There has also been considerable damage to commercial vineyards&#13;
and wine production facilities in the south, particularly in the Mostar area.&#13;

13.    Aericultural services. The organization of agricultural services at the central, Federation, canton&#13;
and municipal levels is in a state of transition. The former structure, with agriculture as part of the&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Industry, changed as of February 1, 1996, when a new Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
Water Management and Forestry at the Federation was created. The intention is to also form departments&#13;
with the same sector responsibilities at the Canton level.&#13;
14.    Before the war there were some 1,200 professional agriculturalists (including animal husbandry)&#13;
in BH; details of the present situation are not yet available. The available professional agricultural staff&#13;
is estimated at only about 250. Of these only a few are at the central and Canton levels, with the bulk&#13;
of the agricultural staff employed at the municipal level. Municipal agricultural staff, typically consisting&#13;
of about 3-5 specialists in agriculture and livestock development, are working in the office of the Mayor.&#13;
In view of the difficult employment situation in the industrial sector, agriculture is given high priority&#13;
in the work program  of the municipalities.  Agricultural extension to private farmers is not yet&#13;
operational. The Municipal agricultural staff is providing advice to farmers, but not in a planned and&#13;
structured manner. Agricultural research is to be carried out in Agricultural Institutes, but due to staff&#13;
and funding shortage and destruction of facilities, little research is presently being undertaken.&#13;
Farm Mechanization&#13;
15.    No recent data is available on the current level of mechanization on private farms in BH, since&#13;
statistics had been published on tractors held on private farms but ceased being collected in 1991. Based&#13;
on 1991 fligures of about 60,000 two-axle tractors and some 32,000 motor-cultivators and single-axle&#13;
tractois (or about one tractor per 17 ha of cultivated land), it is likely that in the aggregate the degree&#13;
of tractorization in BH was adequate prior to the war. For a 40 hp standard tractor, an area of 12 to 15&#13;
ha in hilly areas and up to 30 ha in flat land was considered appropriate. The major part of the farmland&#13;
in BH is on slopes, only about 20 percent of the farmland is on flat areas.&#13;
16.    More than 97 percent of tractors were on private farms (see table below). Because of the small&#13;
farm size structure, however, there were still likely to be many farmers who did not have access to&#13;
mechanical equipment; this could account for the high horse population then (1 horse per 9 ha of cropped&#13;
arable land). The main aggregate mechanization problem previously observed within Former Yugoslavia&#13;
was the shortage of specialist equipment at the farm level.&#13;
17.    The other main problem was the very small farm size and the difficulty farmers have in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;

establishing sound commercial arrangements for tractor sharing/hire, particularly on mixed farms where&#13;
daily (but limited) use of tractors is the norm. Effective systems of contracting agricultural services or&#13;
hiring equipment need to be developed to allow individual farmers access to suitable seeders, planters,&#13;
mowers, sprayers, harvesting equipment etc., without having to invest themselves. As a positive step&#13;
towards more efficient agricultural production, the previous restriction on the maximum farm size of 15&#13;
ha has been lifted. Hence, it can be expected that more suitable, larger farm structures would emerge&#13;
in the medium term, especially as soon as alternative sources of household income become available and&#13;
part-time farmers would decide to lease or sell their land to others.&#13;

18.    The war has affected the major part of the existing farm equipment. An estimated 70-80 percent&#13;
of the tractors and implements including single-axle tractors and combine harvesters has been destroyed&#13;
or stolen. Of the remaining equipment, only about 50-70 percent is in working condition due to&#13;
maintenance problems and lack of spare parts in the war situation. The equipment is mostly aged and&#13;
in many cases major rehabilitation work will not solve the mechanization problem in the medium term.&#13;
The reliability and quality of work of this equipment is not adequate.&#13;
19.   It is estimated that in many areas up to 30 percent of the arable land is not cultivated. The main&#13;
reason given by farmers for that circumstance is the shortage of farm equipment, ranking ahead of other&#13;
factors such as the presence of land mines, or issues of disputed land ownership. Lack of combine&#13;
harvesters has led to delayed harvests and low crop yields, and the provision of combine harvesters is&#13;
therefore considered as high priority. Lack of farm equipment is also responsible for insufficient land&#13;
preparation and planting, especially for cereal crops and potatoes. The remaining farmers are generally&#13;
cultivating those areas where they presently live, provided they have the inputs and equipment to do so.&#13;
With the few remaining farm machines, a system of private contracting of machinery service appears to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 8 of 34&#13;
be developing gradually, which will make possible the economic use of machines even with BH's small&#13;
farm sizes.&#13;
20.   A high percentage of the rural population, which was formerly employed in industrial enterprises&#13;
and was running srnall farms of 0.1 - 3 ha as a part-time business, are now left to survive from the&#13;
returns of their farm land. These farmers are heavily affected by the loss or destruction of their farm&#13;
equipment, which in most cases were motor-cultivators or single-axle tractors. The horse population has&#13;
also been heavily reduced since January 1992, by an estimated 36 percent, from 90,000 to 58,000. The&#13;
remaining horses are mainly used for transport.&#13;
21.   A high percentage of the agricultural land is dedicated to forage production for livestock. In&#13;
some areas, over 50 percent of the arable land is used for artificial meadows, maize or rape production&#13;
for forage purposes. The productivity in forage production is extremely low. Of 5 to 7 possible cuts&#13;
on the artificial meadows, only 2 cuts are actually performed. This not only translates into lower yields&#13;
but also results in poor quality of the hay. Most of the hay harvest is done by hand, with an output of&#13;
no more than 0.3 ha/day. This compares to an output with a motorized single-axle mower of about 2.7&#13;
ha/day. Most of the maize and rape as well as the grass grown at present cannot be used for the&#13;
production of silage because of lack of shredders. Better quality forage for animals is urgently required&#13;
to enable the rehabilitation of the livestock. This bottleneck towards animal feeding requires urgent&#13;
addressing.  There are indications that the reproduction rate of cattle suffers due to insufficient&#13;
alimentation.&#13;
22.   While the availability of spare parts and workshop services is in general not satisfying, there are&#13;
regional differences. For the present stock of machinery, no inventory or listing of required spare parts&#13;
exists. There is also uncertainty whether some of the required parts are still in production because much&#13;
of the existing equipment is outdated. Spare parts were formerly distributed on a centralized basis, and&#13;
new channels of distribution have to be developed. Dealers for agricultural equipment and spare parts&#13;
are already emerging, and they will require training for new machines and technology, to be provided&#13;
by the respective machinery suppliers. As an alternative to commercial farm equipment dealers, farmer&#13;
cooperatives, base on the initiative of private individual farmers, are also emerging. These cooperatives&#13;
are mainly input supply and output marketing associations, and they represent an excellent potential to&#13;
develop as a dealer network for farm equipment.&#13;
Livestock Production&#13;
23.   Livestock are important in BH, particularly cattle and sheep. While the area of main crops grown&#13;
in BH only represented 12 percent of that in the former Yugoslavia, its herd of breeding cows and of&#13;
breeding sheep amounted to 25 percent and 18 percent respectively of the former national totals. The&#13;
table below indicates the numbers of livestock in BH and the proportion held in the private and socialist&#13;
sectors. The vast majority are in the private sector (see table below). Only with intensive livestock,&#13;
especially poultry (37 percent) and pigs (19 percent) did the socialist sector control a significant&#13;
proportion of the herd.&#13;
24.   Technical performance from livestock is quite poor and was generally below that in other parts&#13;
of the former Yugoslavia except in the case of sheep meat production. For example, the milk produced&#13;
per cow per year, which is a key dairying performance indicator, is under 1,500 liters in BH and only&#13;
83 percent of the average for the former Yugoslavia. This is only about one third of that achieved by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 9 of 34&#13;
average dairy farms in western Europe. Similarly, with one of the key indicators for pigs - number&#13;
slaughtered per sow per year, the BH performance of 10.4 is 93 percent of that of the former Yugoslavia&#13;
and only about 50 percent of that achieved on successful western European farms. Poor livestock&#13;
performance is due to limited availability of feed as well as the almost complete lack of extension service&#13;
to private farmers; professional agricultural services were devoted to large-scale farms in the socially-&#13;
owned sector on which extensive management systems were practiced and where reasonable yields,&#13;
regardless of economic considerations, were obtained.&#13;

25.   Livestock numbers are estimated by FAO/WFP to have fallen sharply by August 1994 at which&#13;
time, the total populations had fallen, compared with the January 1992 levels as shown in the table below.&#13;
Estimates as of end-1995 indicate a possible reduction of livestock to only 30 percent of pre-war levels.&#13;
Import requirements suggested by the Government equal 60,000 pregnant heifers, 70-100,000 sheep, and&#13;
45-50,000 goats. The potential for sustained livestock production, in the absence of livestock imports,&#13;
is now likely to be well below that in 1991 as a result of the considerably diminished herds.&#13;

26.   Cattle husbandrv. The pre-war cattle population of BH of some 950,000 head were largely&#13;
maintained by private farmers. These were kept on small-holdings and individual herd sizes were small,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 10 of 34&#13;
frequently of less than six heads. Sinimental and Brown Swiss dual purpose type cattle were kept for the&#13;
production of meat and milk. During the summer months, cattle graze on natural and in some cases&#13;
improved sown pastures, but the long winter requires their housing for six months of the year. Winter&#13;
feeding is on locally conserved hay which is harvested late and, as a result, of poor digestibility and&#13;
quality. Due to the necessity to keep as many productive cattle on the premises as possible, calves are&#13;
sold at a young age for veal, only the minimal number of female calves being kept as replacements.&#13;
Some 4 percent of the cattle population were maintained on State farms. These institutions kept Holstein-&#13;
Friesian type cows, largely on intensive zero grazing systems, typically making corn silage as the&#13;
maintenance ration and feeding concentrates for production. A limited number of Holstein-Friesian cattle&#13;
are also kept by the private sector.&#13;
27.   Milk is mostly sold privately, also to milk factories at Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica which are&#13;
operating at low levels of capacity at the present time. Thriving peri-urban dairy industry is reported&#13;
surrounding Sarajevo, including a State farm. Simmental cattle are considered very suitable for the areas&#13;
around Tuzla, Zenica and north towards Tesanj, with Brown Swiss being more popular in the areas of&#13;
Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres. The husbandry standards to achieve good performance from Holstein-&#13;
Friesian cows and the demand for a dual purpose breed suggest that importation of this breed in large&#13;
numbers is inadvisable at the present time.&#13;
28.    Sheep husbandry. Prior to the war, the sheep population of BH is estimated at 1.3 million.&#13;
Sheep fulfil a triple purpose role producing milk for cheese making, a light yield of coarse wool, and&#13;
meat. Production systems are typified by the system adopted for the Pramnenka breed in the areas of&#13;
Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres. During the winter months flocks are maintained on the lowland pasture&#13;
of valley bottoms with limited additional feeding of poor quality hay. Multiple births are rare and the&#13;
occasional twins that are born are usually fostered on to ewes that have lost their lamb. However,&#13;
Pramenka breeders in the Herzegovina region report that strains of the breed may lamb twice a year.&#13;
In this area, limited selection, controlled breeding and hormonal treatments are under investigation aiming&#13;
to produce up to six lambs in a two year period. Milk production is approximately 150 kg per lactation,&#13;
yielding 15 kg of cheese. Flocks, which are entirely in the hands of private owners, range in size from&#13;
20, to as large as 1,000 head. The breed is extremely hardy and uniquely adapted to the demanding&#13;
production environment. The replacement or dilution of this breed type could be detrimental to the use&#13;
of this harsh production environment.&#13;
29.   For example, information from authorities in Travnik details a 1992 population of 50,000&#13;
Vlasicka Pramenka3 which now equals about 20,000 only. Prior to the immediate past, this decline is&#13;
attributed to the nationalization of winter valley grazing land for industrial development, housing and for&#13;
cultivation. To combat this, transport of sheep flocks to winter grazing areas as far away as Slovenia by&#13;
rail and road transport, had been practiced in the past. This opportunity has now been lost by recent&#13;
political events. An Association of Private Farmers in Travnik represents 158 members, primarily sheep&#13;
farmers who own flocks ranging from 40 - 1,000 heads. The Association provides credit, advice and a&#13;
limited range of inputs. It is also marketing wool, cheese and milk. Over the war, members' flocks have&#13;
been reduced from 50,000 to 10,000 and many of the grazing areas are known to be heavily mined.&#13;
30.   The Association of Private Farmers in Travnik represents a potential focus for both the expansion&#13;
and improvement of the Pramenka breed. Due to the limited income available from the sale of wool and&#13;
3  Vlasicka Pramenka are a local sub type located in Travnik and grazing the Vlasic mountain pasture in the&#13;
summer. Other local types are the Privorska and Kupreska Pramenka located at Bugojno and Kupres,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 11 of 34&#13;
cheese, farmers are obliged to also sell male and female lambs for income, limiting their opportunity to&#13;
increase flock size. To allow breed expansion, the Association is prepared to buy better quality female&#13;
lambs and superior ram lambs, to distribute to small flock owners and to new farmers. Beneficiaries&#13;
would need to become members of the Association and would need a sufficient loan grace period before&#13;
production and hence debt repayment could be expected. Shepherding is essentially a family occupation,&#13;
with younger men taking the flock to the mountains for summer grazing and older family members&#13;
tending the lowl'and holding. The areas of Travnik, Bugojno and Kupres have suffered heavy war&#13;
damage and are target areas for assistance of this kind.&#13;
31.   Goat husbandry. The pre-war goat population is estimated at 95,000. In 1951, the goat&#13;
populations in various regions were, however, considerably larger; 250,000 has been cited as the&#13;
population for the Travnik region alone. In 1951, an edict was issued by the Government of the former&#13;
Yugoslavia prohibiting the keeping of goats. At the time this was probably considered a conservation&#13;
measure to conserve forestry stocks. It is now more widely accepted that the potential of correctly&#13;
managed goat flocks is substantial. There seems no prejudice about the consumption of goat meat and&#13;
the recognition of the value of goat milk is increasing. Private farmers have expressed interest in goat&#13;
production and the re-establishment of goat flocks is occurring. Individual flocks of up to 200 goats are&#13;
managed commercially in the Herzegovina region.&#13;
32.   Goat husbandry would be complementary to cattle and sheep husbandry. Goats may utilize much&#13;
of the waste vegetable fodder from the horticultural industry, crop stovers, hillside and wayside browse&#13;
which is not readily used by alternative ruminant livestock, providing the opportunity to expand both milk&#13;
and meat production. The reproductive capability of goats, being unrestricted by seasonal influences&#13;
would also allow the more rapid expansion of population numbers in selected areas. Provided&#13;
beneficiaries can be identified with a willingness to adopt satisfactory goat husbandry methods, the&#13;
importation of goats should be strongly supported. The population of indigenous goats has been so&#13;
reduced that the risks of breed degeneration is of less significance than in the case for sheep.&#13;
33.   Pig and poultry husbandry. Pigs were kept on a fairly large scale in BH by State farms, more&#13;
commonly in the north of the country. Most farms fattened two or three pigs, slaughtered their own pigs&#13;
and produced smoked meat and sausages for the winter period. Pigs are mostly of large white and&#13;
landrace breeds or hybrids of these types. Poultry were also produced on State farms both for eggs and&#13;
broiler production. Poultry keeping is common throughout the country in backyard systems, but also in&#13;
larger numbers in cages and in deep litter houses. Poultry and rabbit keeping have received noteworthy&#13;
assistance from humanitarian agencies, to the extent that some producers are now finding that it is&#13;
difficult to market eggs. Individual farmers have small incubators, as does the State farm at Visoko.&#13;
With the rapid reproductive capabilities of pigs and poultry, importations of these species appear not be&#13;
of priority.&#13;
34.   Feed Balances. An examination of livestock numbers in January 1992 compared with the feed&#13;
availability for them indicates that BH was in significant livestock feed deficit. As to protein meals,&#13;
annual needs were about 300,000 tons but with no significant domestic production. Assuming that most&#13;
of the wheat was used for domestic consumption, the availability of cereals for livestock feed was only&#13;
about 61 percent of the level needed. On the bulk feed front, calculations indicated availability of about&#13;
81 percent of the amount needed, although if straw and vegetable waste were included, the bulk feed&#13;
requirements would be met, albeit with low quality products. The apparent shortage of feed is consistent&#13;
with the poor livestock performance achieved. Clearly the development focus within the livestock sector&#13;
should be to equate numbers with feed availability, specialize and concentrate on improving technical&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 12 of 34&#13;
35.   Destruction of livestock during the war period has largely corrected the livestock food imbalance.&#13;
With the new livestock numbers (assuming similar herd structure), but 1991 crop production levels, there&#13;
would be adequate availability of cereals and roughage (on aggregate, 120 percent and 143 percent of&#13;
estimated needs) and the protein meal deficit would have halved.&#13;
Animal Health and Veterinary Services&#13;
36.   The animal health situation in BH used to be comparable with western Europe and disease control&#13;
measures have been implemented for many years. Bovine tuberculosis is at a low level and prior to the&#13;
war cattle were tested annually. Testing and eradication programs also existed for brucellosis and bovine&#13;
leucosis. Trichinosis (Trichinella spiralis) occurs in pigs and is the subject of porcine meat inspection.&#13;
Canine rabies is controlled by regular vaccination and the main rabies vector is the red fox. Recently&#13;
a number of positive cases have been recorded in Herzegovina in this species. Where war has disrupted&#13;
vaccination programs there is concern about the re-emergence of rabies; response to calls for vaccination,&#13;
which has to be paid for, is low. In Herzegovina, when rabies has been diagnosed in a locality, free&#13;
vaccination in the vicinity has been provided. An outbreak of classical swine fever was recently recorded&#13;
in Herzegovina, originating from an importation of pigs from Poland. The disease has been rapidly&#13;
controlled by a policy of slaughter on infected premises and ring vaccination. Helminthiasis and&#13;
fascioliasis are important production limiting diseases. This disease status does not, however, allow for&#13;
complacency as illustrated by the aforementioned outbreak of swine fever. With the unsettled situation&#13;
in the area, with refugee movements with livestock continuing, and with the prevailing disease situation&#13;
in countries to the east, FMD and possibly rinderpest are potential threats.&#13;
37.   The administrative structure of the veterinary services in BH is currently represented by two&#13;
offices in Sarajevo and Mostar. The administrations have regulatory and supervisory responsibilities.&#13;
Field veterinarians are engaged at the municipality (district) level; there may be one or more veterinary&#13;
stations within a municipality depending on size of the town, with ancillary field stations in smaller&#13;
townships. A variable number of veterinarians work from these stations providing clinical services, food&#13;
hygiene inspection, artificial inseminations, sale of animal health requisites and in some areas pest control&#13;
particularly for rodents. Due to the population movements that have recently occurred no accurate&#13;
estimate of the number of veterinarians in BH is available. There are known to be 86 in the Herzegovina&#13;
region. But no single figure is available for the total number of veterinary stations or sub-stations for&#13;
BH as a whole.&#13;
38.   The condition of veterinary stations varies from complete destruction or severe damage, to&#13;
adequate and, in a limited number of cases, elaborate. A number of stations have suffered from long lack&#13;
of maintenance or care, but in some cases, even in war damaged areas the premises are more generous&#13;
than a private practice providing the same services would expect to work from in other countries. This&#13;
is undoubtedly a legacy from the former system of government, where more wealthy administrations were&#13;
prepared to provide superior facilities. The group of veterinarians operating from a station enjoy&#13;
considerable financial autonomy. A work plan for the year is prepared and fees for the full range of&#13;
services are specified subject to approval of the municipality. The fees are economic and the income&#13;
accruing from the services delivered is used to pay professional and ancillary staff, purchase drugs and&#13;
requirements, operate vehicles and maintain premises. This also attributes to the disparity of premises&#13;
and equipment; vets in war-torn areas have lost their source of income as livestock numbers have declined&#13;
and clients have been unable to pay for their services. In general the availability of curative drugs is&#13;
rather adequate and veterinarians have shown great initiative in obtaining supplies from medical sources,&#13;
NGOs and other channels, but preventative vaccines for farm animals are limited. This reflects the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 13 of 34&#13;
demand for treatment in emergency, but a reluctance on behalf of farmers to pay for preventative&#13;
medicine when resources are scarce.&#13;
39.   In the past the main diagnostic support has been provided by the Veterinary Institute attached to&#13;
the Faculty of Veterinary Science in Sarajevo which is reported to have suffered light war damage.&#13;
Regional Veterinary Institutes are located in Mostar, Tuzla and Zenica. The Mostar institute had been&#13;
previously located on the east side of town and is entirely destroyed without any equipment left. These&#13;
regional veterinary institutes were historically conceived to provide food hygiene services and provide&#13;
bacteriological culture, heavy metal determination, parasitological examinations and limited serology (at&#13;
Mostar and Tuzla only). All institutes are severely limited for want of diagnostic reagents, chemicals,&#13;
antigens and equipment. There are no facilities for immuno-fluorescent microscopy, ELISA testing or&#13;
blood analyses for metabolic profiles at the regional stations, although staff are familiar with the&#13;
techniques and appreciate the value that would be provided. A reliable and rapid diagnostic capability&#13;
will be essential within BH and although reference may be made to outside international services, a much&#13;
improved domestic service appears essential. The institutes again are reliant on fees raised for their&#13;
remuneration and operation of their institute.&#13;
20.    Throughout BH artificial insemination services are provided by the field veterinary stations.&#13;
Prior to the war 170,000 bovine inseminations were performed annually. This service is important to&#13;
small scale farmers who cannot maintain a bull, for breed improvement and disease control. Under war&#13;
conditions the Al service has been maintained by local initiative, with the help of NGOs and other donor&#13;
agencies. Communications and lack of vehicles for response to calls will undoubtedly have reduced&#13;
achievements with Al and poor fertility suspected to be associated with poor nutrition and timing of&#13;
insemination are problems. Liquid nitrogen supply is currently the major problem in the center of the&#13;
country. There is no central Al service structure as yet and semen is purchased by stations, most&#13;
commonly from Zagreb. Limited numbers of sheep and pig inseminations are also performed. All&#13;
services are paid for by the beneficiary.&#13;
21.   The system of delivery of veterinary services indicates that a private service is already being&#13;
provided, constrained only by the prescription of standardized charges and the inability of poor and&#13;
deprived clients to pay for the services provided. Under these circumstances providing free or subsidized&#13;
drugs to veterinarians or to farmers in war-damaged areas is likely to distort the emerging market. As&#13;
such areas are frequently localized and drugs are readily transportable, they are likely to circulate quickly&#13;
into other areas that have no need for such benefits. Established importers such as Bosna Vet, an&#13;
association of veterinarians at Zenica, could find their business threatened by unfair competition from&#13;
concessional aid. There will be other unidentified groups or individuals also dependent on such trade for&#13;
their livelihood. (There is no veterinary drug or vaccine production in BH, supplies commonly originate&#13;
from the company Plivu, Zagreb; medical drug manufacture in Sarajevo has the capability of formulating&#13;
and manufacturing some antibiotics that could be used for veterinary treatments).&#13;
Bank Pre-war Involvement in Agriculture&#13;
40.   BH has been involved in some 28 World Bank funded projects since the early 1970s. Five of&#13;
these were agriculturally related. A sixth loan, which was for forestry, was appraised, approved by the&#13;
Bank's Board but not signed by the Government. In each case, the participating BH agency was Privedna&#13;
Banka Sarajevo. Total Bank lending to BH's agriculture has been about US$96 million, some 15 percent&#13;
of total Bank lending to BH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Pg 14 of 34&#13;
41.   A review of the completion reports of BH agricultural projects indicates that, as with other&#13;
projects in Yugoslavia, most were financed in an unstable macroeconomic environment involving a&#13;
distorted incentive system and weak intermediary financial institutions. Most of the funding under these&#13;
World Bank projects was to the socially-owned farm and enterprise sector. The limited amount of&#13;
financing available under the second and third agricultural credit projects, which were targeted to private&#13;
farmers, was normally only available to farmers having long-term contracts with social sector units. To&#13;
date, therefore, the Bank has had little experience in lending to the truly private agricultural sector within&#13;
BH. The proposed project would be the Bank's first operation in BH specifically aiming at this sector.&#13;

management advice, as well as agricultural aid coordination, to help with medium term programs and&#13;
establish the economic basis for agriculture in the future. Projects with a medium term perspective would&#13;
deal with rehabilitation and development of the forestry sector, vineyard and orchard replanting, the&#13;
creation of agricultural extension and other farmer support services, and would address specific issues&#13;
of agricultural and rural finance as well as those of agro-industries.&#13;

IBRD/ IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
46.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-funded&#13;
reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the World Bank, IMF, EU, EBRD, and USAID in&#13;
late 1995 resulted in the preparation, with the Government, of a priority reconstruction program which&#13;
was presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels on December 20-&#13;
21, 1995. This program identified some US$5.1 billion of external financing needed to meet BH's urgent&#13;
reconstruction needs, of which US$1.8 billion would be needed in the first year, 1996. This first donor&#13;
meeting led to new donor conmmitments of some US$500 million for priority reconstruction activities for&#13;
the first quarter of 1996. Another conference is scheduled for spring of 1996 to seek financing pledges&#13;
from donors for the remainder of 1996 as well as to present needs for the entire reconstruction program.&#13;
47.   The Bank's own assistance strategy for BH consists of a two-track approach: First, prior to&#13;
financial normalization and membership in the World Bank Group, the Bank will support selected&#13;
immediate assistance programs through the special World Bank Trust Fund for BH (TFBH) in the amount&#13;
of US$150 million. Of these Trust Fund resources, US$125 million is to be extended at concessional&#13;
terms identical to those offered by IDA and US$25 million is to be provided as a grant. Second, once&#13;
the country becomes a World Bank Group member, a program of lending and technical assistance would&#13;
be initiated to support reconstruction and development, as well as economic transformation. The current&#13;
pipeline of operations in CY 1996-1997, to be financed both from the TFBH as well as subsequently from&#13;
regular World Bank Group resources, comprises a number of emergency-type projects, including this&#13;
proposed FRP, the above-mentioned Emergency Recovery Project, and prospective operations in gas,&#13;
district heating, transport, war victims rehabilitation, and water supply, followed by additional projects&#13;
in education, health, housing, employment generation, de-mining, electric power supply, forestry and&#13;
agricultural services, and a structural adjustment operation.&#13;

C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
48.   The urgent need to rebuild war-damaged private farms and to replace lost farm assets, in an&#13;
economic and social environment overburdened by the presence of displaced persons and refugees where&#13;
rural employment opportunities are scarce and food security is at stake, constitute the circumstances that&#13;
this Bank operation is designed to address. The objectives of the project are to jump-start agricultural&#13;
production, improve food security, and create employment and income for the war-affected rural&#13;
population including returning displaced persons. The project will primarily aim at the private farm&#13;
sector, with a priority for full-time farmers. The current emergency reconstruction phase calls for&#13;
projects with fast, direct impact on the ground; hence project design has been kept straightforward such&#13;
as to allow for speedy implementation.&#13;
49.   To achieve the above objectives, the project includes four components: (i) import of farm&#13;
mechanization equipment; (ii) import and domestic transfer of livestock; (iii) rebuilding and strengthening&#13;
of animai health services; and (iv) support to implement the project. Details of these components are&#13;
given below. Bank-financed project cost are estimated based on implementation in the Bosniac-Croat&#13;
Federation. An inclusion of the Republika Srpska under Bank-financing would require a revision of&#13;
project costs. Detailed cost tables are included in Appendix 1.&#13;
Farm Mechanization Component&#13;
50.   The project would provide an initial emergency supply of critically needed farm mechanization&#13;
equipment, including motor-cultivators, small- and medium-size tractors, tractor spare parts associated&#13;
with new machinery, tractor implements, and grain-combine harvesters, in order to replace lost farm&#13;
assets in war-affected areas of BH. Spare parts for existing machinery are not considered at the moment&#13;
because (i) the machinery is rather aged and does not merit major repairs; (ii) the project would aim to&#13;
provide farmers with only major equipment that they cannot afford from their own financial resources&#13;
at the present time; (iii) the cost of logistics required to provide the needed spare parts through the project&#13;
would probably not justify the expected benefits since, even after repair, most of the remaining farm&#13;
equipment is likely not to deliver satisfactory performance.&#13;
51.   The total base cost of this project component is US$ 31.4 million equivalent (see table below).&#13;
All equipment would be provided on the basis of in-kind supply and credit arrangements. A description&#13;
of the sub-components is provided below. Through the project, only a small fraction of the destroyed&#13;
and needed machinery (about 1.5 percent of two-axle-tractors and 14 percent of single-axle tractors) will&#13;
be covered. Hence, it will be possible to select among the target group full-time farmers with prior&#13;
experience in farming, such as to aim at maximum benefits from the equipment. A priority was given&#13;
to small-size, single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators, which are very popular in BH and most suitable for&#13;
the small plot sizes in the country, and also in order to maximize the number of private farmer-&#13;
beneficiaries under the project. Summary technical specifications are provided in Appendix 5.&#13;
52.   The supply of machines and implements through the project would involve, where appropriate,&#13;
existing dealers or workshops for agricultural machinery in order to promote private sector initiatives in&#13;
this sector. Suppliers of machines would be obliged to provide training for dealers and workshops&#13;
regarding repair, maintenance and handling of the new machines. They would also ensure that the future&#13;
supply of spare and replacement parts is guaranteed through commercial channels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 18 of 34&#13;
53.    Two-axle tractors (US$ 9.25 million equivalent base cost). Lack of farm power is one of the&#13;
major constraints to increase agricultural production in BH. As a result, large areas of arable land are&#13;
not cultivated at present. In view of the difficult topography of BH and the small farm structure, large&#13;
tractors cannot be used. Under the project, a total of about 750 two-axle tractors would be provided in&#13;
three ranges of tractors: 250 units of small standard tractors in the range of 18-26 kW with four-wheel&#13;
drive especially suited for farmers in hilly areas; and standard tractors in the range of 27-37 kW, both&#13;
with (200 units) and without (300 units) four-wheel drive, for larger farms in flat and slightly hilly areas.&#13;
54.    Accessory tools for two-axle tractors (US$ 1.5 million equivalent base cost). Along with the&#13;
tractors, a similar percentage of tractor implements has been destroyed or stolen. However, to simplify&#13;
project implementation, the rnumber of different implements for two-axle tractors, to be purchased under&#13;
the project, has been minimized and reduced to tractor trailers only. If additional cofinancing becomes&#13;
available during project implementation, more implements, such as tools for soil tillage and seed-bed&#13;
preparation, planting seeding and harvest would be purchased as well. The project would finance the&#13;
import of transport trailers, provided as a package together with the two-axle tractors. Since all trailers&#13;
are standardized and of rather simple technical nature, and as the power range of the provided tractors&#13;
is similar to those remaining operational at present, the imported implements would also fit to existing&#13;
tractors. Hence, farmers who only lack implements could obtain those under the project as well.&#13;

55.    Single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators (US$ 11.98 million equivalent base cost).  For the&#13;
provision of single-axle tractors, the same rationale applies as for the two-axle tractors. The main&#13;
objective is to increase availability of farm power, especially for very small farms or in extremely hilly&#13;
areas. As the use of these single-axle tractors is mainly for agriculture, and in view of the heavy soils&#13;
that are predominant in some parts of BH, a total of 3,700 medium and large size single-axle tractors will&#13;
be provided under the project, as follows: a total of 1,400 units each in the ranges 5-7 kW and 7-9 kW,&#13;
and 900 units in the 10 kW range.&#13;
56.    Accessory tools for single-axle tractors/ motor-cultivators (US$ 4.93 million equivalent base cost).&#13;
Since single-axle tractors of the above size tend to lack standardization, each tractor will be delivered as&#13;
a package with a basic implement set comprising wheel ballast, plow, rotavator, ridger and a trailer.&#13;
Regarding the trailer, farmers will have a choice between free wheel trailers for flat areas and trailers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 19 of 34&#13;
with wheels driven by the tractor for hilly areas. The total cost of these accessory tools provided in&#13;
packages would be US$ 3.73 million. Apart from these sets of standard implements, the project would&#13;
offer for about 50 percent of the single-axle tractors imported a pesticide sprayer attached with a 10 m&#13;
spray boom, at a combined cost of US$ 1.2 million. This would enable those farmers operating with&#13;
single-axle tractors on fairly flat land to properly apply pesticides on their field crops.&#13;
57.   Combine harvesters and grass mowers (US$ 1.81 million equivalent base cost). Grass and hay&#13;
harvest in hilly areas is at present done mostly by hand. The use of walking type self propelled grass&#13;
mowers would increase the output from 0.3 ha/day up to an estimated 2.7 ha/day. This technology is&#13;
known in BH and used on a limited basis so far. As forage harvest is considered a major bottleneck in&#13;
livestock areas, those machines provide a very useful input to increase harvest capacity, and the project&#13;
would finance 200 units at a combined cost of US$ 0.3 million. Untimely harvest, caused by a severe&#13;
lack of combine harvester capacity, has led to low crop yields, specifically in wheat combine harvesters.&#13;
Due to the difficult topographic situation and limited plot sizes, the smallest standard combines available&#13;
with working widths of about 2.5 m are envisaged for financing under the project. Only for flat areas,&#13;
larger combines of 3-4 m width will be provided. For the combines under the project, maize headers&#13;
for grain maize harvest will be included. The total cost of 10 combines with implements under the&#13;
project would be US$ 1.51 million.&#13;
58.   To assist in the review of specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the procurement&#13;
of equipment and spare parts, the project would finance expatriate (6 man/months) and domestic (12 m/ni)&#13;
mechanization experts, at a total cost of US$ 96,000. Farmer training and education (12 m/m) would&#13;
be provided at a cost of US$ 180,000, focussing on the most productive use of the supplied equipment&#13;
in the soil conditions of BH. The project would also finance fees of the procurement agent (2 percent&#13;
of the import cost of goods), the cost of domestic transport (2 percent), handling and storage (0.5&#13;
percent), and local distribution to farmers (1 percent), at a combined estimated cost of US$ 1.62 million.&#13;
Livestock Production Component&#13;
59.   To assist in the initial rebuilding of the national herds for milk and meat production, the project&#13;
would finance the purchase of livestock such as cattle, goat, and sheep, to be kept by private individual&#13;
small-scale farmers. The total base cost of the component would be US$ 14.0 million equivalent (see&#13;
table below). To the extent available and suitable, livestock would be procured from regional or domestic&#13;
sources, such as for Pramenka sheep. All livestock would be distributed to farmers on the basis of in-&#13;
kind supply and credit arrangements, described in sections further below. The livestock production&#13;
component has the below-described four sub-components.&#13;
60.   Importation of cattle (US$ 8.8 million equivalent base cost). A total of about 5,000 pregnant&#13;
heifers of the Simmental, Brown Swiss and Grey Tyrol breeds at an estimated average unit cost of US$&#13;
1,760 would be imported for distribution to farmers who have lost cattle and have the experience and&#13;
capability of caring for them. These breeds are well accepted in the respective areas and being dual&#13;
purpose breeds have both meat and milk potential. Additional costs would arise from cattle procurement,&#13;
transport and international travel for specialists from BH to approve selection of the appropriate type of&#13;
animals, feed costs whilst in reception and quarantine, and for veterinary attention at the same time.&#13;
Provisional technical specifications and required sanitary conditions for the importation have been&#13;
prepared and are provided in Appendix 5. The number of imported cattle for this emergency project is&#13;
substantial, but nevertheless modest enough to take into account the considerable logistic problems of the&#13;
transport of large numbers of animals to war-torn areas in the first year of recovery, the recent&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

experiences of cattle imports by international donors, and the problems of animal quarantine in the first&#13;
year. This component would be implemented in two stages of about equal financial value, with the&#13;
second stage depending on successful implementation of the first stage.&#13;

61.   Goat importation (US$ 0.99 million equivalent base cost). A total of 3,000 goats of the Alpsko-&#13;
Srnaste, Sanksa and Toggenburg breeds would be imported at an average cost of US$ 330 each. These&#13;
animals would be young does and bucks of breeding age, in a ratio of 10 females to one male. The high&#13;
ratio of dows is advised as goats will be distributed to small scattered households and a lower ratio may&#13;
limit breeding success. Technical specifications are provided in Appendix 5. Pregnant females are not&#13;
categorically specified; with the shorter duration of pregnancy in this species, in contra-distinction to&#13;
cattle, it may be difficult to assemble pregnant goats at suitable times for shipment. Although goats have&#13;
a wider breeding stason than sheep, many goats kid in the spring months at which time the main&#13;
shipments will be made. For health reasons, the transport of heavily pregnant does is to be avoided.&#13;
62.   Sheep importation (US$ 2.1 million equivalent base cost). While, in some cases, importation of&#13;
sheep has proven unsuccessful in the past, technical experts in the Government point out that sheep of&#13;
the Wuerttemberg type is most suitable for the climatic conditions in BH. Under the project, it is&#13;
envisaged to import up to 3,000 sheep of this type, at a unit cost of US$ 700.&#13;
63.   Pramenka sheep breed conservation and expansion (US$ 0.48 million equivalent base cost). As&#13;
set out further above, the various types of Pramenka sheep are uniquely adapted to the production&#13;
environment of the interior of BH. Under the project, a scheme would be established to conserve and&#13;
expand the Pramenka breed. Existing sheep farmers with surplus female lambs of good quality would&#13;
be encouraged to sell these lambs for onward distribution to beneficiaries with small flocks to build up&#13;
head numbers. A purchase price of US$ 120 equivalent is envisaged for weaned lambs which would&#13;
allow the conservation of some 4,000 breeding females. A comparable scheme already operates in the&#13;
Herzegovina region, and advice on the implementation and full consistency with this scheme will be&#13;
essential. The Association of Private Farmer in Travnik, given adequate accountability, would be a focus&#13;
for participation and implementation of this scheme.&#13;
64.   To assist in the review of specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the procurement&#13;
of animals, including inspection of suitable animals and suppliers abroad, the project would finance&#13;
expatriate (6 man/months) and domestic (12 m/m) livestock experts, at a total cost of US$ 96,000. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 21 of 34&#13;
project would also finance fees of the procurement agent (2 percent), the cost of domestic transport (5&#13;
percent), handling/ storage/ quarantine (5 percent), as well as local distribution to farmers (1 percent),&#13;
at a combined estimated cost of some US$ 1.53 million.&#13;
Animal Health Services Component&#13;
65.    To quickly restore vital animal health services in areas of wide-spread destruction, the project&#13;
would finance the equipment, drugs, as well as basic building repairs for veterinary stations, veterinary&#13;
institutes, and artificial insemination (AI) services. The total base cost of this component would be US$&#13;
2.1 million equivalent (see table below). Drugs and vaccines would be provided to private, damaged&#13;
veterinary stations against nearly commercial credit arrangements, such as not to interfere with competing&#13;
private veterinarians that have not suffered war damage. Investment goods such as equipment for&#13;
veterinarians, including equipment for Al services, would be provided at concessional credit terms, while&#13;
building repairs for veterinary stations would be grants. Assistance to veterinary institutes would also&#13;
be grants. This project component has the below-described five sub-components.&#13;

66.    Eguipment for veterinary stations (US$ 0.51 million equivalent base cost). The project would&#13;
support the supply of 40 damaged veterinary field stations with essential animal health instruments and&#13;
equipment, at a package cost of US$ 12,750 (see Appendix 5 for a detailed listing). The equipment&#13;
would be shared by groups of about 4 veterinarians working from one field station, hence a total of 160&#13;
veterinarians would benefit from this sub-component. The equipment would cover clinical diagnosis, as&#13;
well as medical and surgical treatments of both farm and companion animals.&#13;
67.    Drugs and vaccines for veterinarv stations (US$ 0.39 million equivalent base cost). The project&#13;
would finance the import of selected, critical drugs for bovine fertility (US$ 41,000), sera (US$ 7,000),&#13;
as well as vaccines (US$ 190,000). A contingency provision of US$ 150,000 is included to meet&#13;
emergencies and re-order vaccines for endemic diseases as initial supplies are used up.&#13;
68.    While comprehensive lists of vaccine requirements have been provided by the Government, these&#13;
represent the complete range of diseases known to occur in the country. However, BH is not isolated&#13;
from commercial traffic and emergency supplies of vaccines may be ordered to specific requirements and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 22 of 34&#13;
delivered rapidly by air in the face of epidemic disease. Furthermore, due to the non-intensive livestock&#13;
husbandry methods adopted, infectious diseases are not a primary issue. The list of vaccines presented&#13;
for immediate procurement in Appendix 5 reflects this evaluation and the capability of the veterinary&#13;
services to deliver the vaccinations. The therapeutic drugs selected address problems of bovine post&#13;
partum infertility, for use by veterinarians in the war damaged areas.&#13;
69.   Building repairs of veterinary stations (US$ 0.4 million equivalent base cost). War damage to&#13;
veterinary stations ranges from complete destruction to only minor damage. The project would finance&#13;
building repairs to 40 selected stations with light to medium damage to put them back to work. A lump&#13;
sum of US$ 10,000 per station is budgeted. The exact amount to be spent on each station would be&#13;
subject to structural and quantitative surveys. Implementation would be carried out by local contractors.&#13;
70.   Equipment for veterinary institutes (US$ 0.35 million equivalent base cost). The restoration of&#13;
sufficient veterinary diagnostic within BH capability is of priority. Detailed study of the specific&#13;
requirements of the Veterinary Faculty in Sarajevo and the regional veterinary institutes will be carried&#13;
out under the project to determine their specific diagnostic requirements and range of equipment to be&#13;
provided in order to restart their diagnostic activities. This would include an emergency budget of US$&#13;
50,000 for the immediate purchase of diagnostic reagents, chemicals, antigens, etc. to restore diagnostics&#13;
with the limited equipment currently available. A budget of US$ 300,000 under the project would&#13;
subsequently finance required veterinary diagnostic equipment.&#13;
71.   Eguipment and supplies for Al services (US$ 0.35 million equivalent base cost). While Al field&#13;
equipment is generally available with veterinary stations, there is a severe lack of liquid nitrogen. On&#13;
the basis of a further field survey of the precise needs of Al service providers in BH, the project would&#13;
finance emergency supplies and equipment for Al services up to a budget limited of US$ 0.35 million.&#13;
72.   To assist in the review of veterinary specifications, selection of pre-qualified suppliers, and the&#13;
procurement of equipment and drugs, the project would finance expatriate (3 man/months) and domestic&#13;
(6 m/m) veterinary experts, at a total cost of US$ 48,000. The project would also finance fees of the&#13;
procurement agent (2 percent), the cost of domestic transport (2 percent), handling and storage (0.5&#13;
percent), as well as local distribution (1 percent), at a combined estimated cost of some US$ 88,000.&#13;
Project Implementation Support&#13;
73.    Given the tight fiscal position of BH during the initial period of recovery from the war, the&#13;
project would finance all required incremental foreign and local cost of implementing this operation, as&#13;
set out in the table below. At a total base cost of US$ 1.55 million equivalent, this will include office&#13;
equipment and vehicles (US$ 0.49 million), technical assistance, training and studies (US$ 0.9 million),&#13;
as well incremental local staff cost and incremental office operating cost (US$ 0.16 million). This would&#13;
cover, for the first project year, the operations of the central PIU in Sarajevo and of the regional&#13;
implementation units, after which the project is expected to be substantially implemented. Government&#13;
resources would be used to extend implementation support activities beyond the first year, if required.&#13;

74.   Project Cost. The total estimated cost of the project equals US$ 70.4 million equivalent,&#13;
including physical contingencies of 3 percent on goods and 7 percent on works. No price contingencies&#13;
have been included given the expected short disbursement period of this emergency project. Project costs&#13;
are summarized in the table below and presented in more detail in Appendix 1.&#13;

75.   Financing Plan. The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be the Recipient of the funds to be&#13;
provided by various donors. Of the total project cost, the Bank would finance US$ 20.0 million&#13;
equivalent at IDA terms. Donor financing (US$ 15.6 million) has been secured from the following&#13;
sources: European Commission (expected contribution of about ECU 4.0 million, to be disbursed in two&#13;
tranches, equivalent to some US$ 5.2 million); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 24 of 34&#13;
US$ 7.3 million equivalent); German Government (US$ 2.2 million equivalent); and Dutch Government&#13;
(US$ 0.9 million equivalent). Additional financing of US$ 14.8 million equivalent is being sought from&#13;
other donors (see financing plan table below). In the event such additional financing could not be&#13;
mobilized by the time of effectiveness of the Bank Credit, the project scope would be adjusted through&#13;
a reduction of imported farm mechanization equipment and imported livestock. A respective project&#13;
module has been identified for exclusion from the project.&#13;

76.   Taxes. The Trust Fund resources provided by the World Bank cannot be used to finance local&#13;
taxes (such as customs duties, sales tax, income tax, etc.). For this purpose, the BH government will&#13;
set up a special fund with contributions from donors, including support from those of balance of payment&#13;
lending or grants. This donor-financed fund would allow the financing of tax payments for those&#13;
beneficiaries who cannot afford this payment.&#13;
77.   Retroactive Financing. Since the project is expected to be considered by the Board of Directors&#13;
in March 1996, with effectiveness not before April 1996, retroactive financing in an amount equivalent&#13;
to 10 percent of the Bank Credit will be included for urgent purchases of priority farm machinery as well&#13;
as selected office equipment. In particular, retroactive financing is necessary for the purchase of selected&#13;
farm equipment such as accessory tools for those motor-cultivators and tractors that are existing in the&#13;
country, which would be put to use during the late spring of 1996 even before other machinery under&#13;
the project would be financed and imported. Retroactive financing will also be used for office equipment&#13;
and key technical assistance required to set up the project implementation infrastructure. Procurement&#13;
for retroactive financing will follow the overall procurement guidelines agreed under the project,&#13;
described further below. To advance delivery/ completion further, advance contracting will be used to&#13;
the maximum extent possible, subject to approval and effectiveness of financing.&#13;
Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
78.   The project is designed to meet about 10 percent of the urgent needs to re-install farm power and&#13;
provide livestock breeding material and veterinary support to make up for war damage. The resulting&#13;
benefits of these activities refer both to a return to productive use of land currently not in production, and&#13;
to increased output on land already in production. In addition to incremental farm and food output, the&#13;
project would generate employment and income for the rural population. This would also and particularly&#13;
benefit demobilized soldiers and former industrial, now unemployed workers, through increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 25 of 34&#13;
opportunities for full-time work and farming on lands formerly farmed on a part-time basis only.&#13;
79.   The expected production increase from farm mechanization is being supported by the supply of&#13;
donor-financed urgent farm inputs for the 1996 spring and autumn planting seasons within the framework&#13;
of the above-mentioned ERP. The machinery provided under the proposed project would typically be&#13;
used to cultivate land not planted during the previous year. The 750 two-axle tractors and 3,700 motor-&#13;
cultivators are likely to result in incremental cultivation of some 35,000 ha (20 ha per tractor and 5 ha&#13;
per motor-cultivator). The increase in food crops (mainly cereals and potatoes) is estimated at some 100-&#13;
120,000 tons of grains and some 20,000 tons of potatoes. With benefits valued at current international&#13;
prices, the farm mechanization component is expected to yield high rates of return. Incremental&#13;
production as a result of the livestock component would consist of additional milk, cheese, meat, and,&#13;
to a lesser extent, wool. Rates of return on the livestock component would also be high. Additional&#13;
substantial benefits would arise from the reduction and eventual phase-out of donor-financed food aid&#13;
deliveries into BH through substitution of the incremental domestic agricultural production for imported&#13;
food.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
80.   The project has been placed in environmental category B. Any project components which present&#13;
an opportunity for environmental enhancement will be designed accordingly, and all components will be&#13;
monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no degradation to the environment.&#13;

D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
81.   MOF/ MAWF. Under the overall guidance and supervision by State-level Ministry of Finance&#13;
as the Recipient of the Bank Credit, the newly created Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and&#13;
Forestry (MAWF) at the Federation level will be responsible for implementation of the project, with&#13;
respect to project beneficiaries situated within the Federation. The new MAWF has been established as&#13;
of February 1, 1996 and will draw on staff and expertise from the previous Department of Agriculture&#13;
and Food Production in the Ministry of Energy and Industry, as well as from the Ministry of&#13;
Construction and Natural Resources. An agricultural ministry with the same name and functions existed&#13;
before the war; however, given the tight budgetary situation and the reduced number of sector specialists&#13;
available in the Government, strong initial support from external experts is required to assist MAWF in&#13;
timely project start-up and implementation.&#13;
82.   The PIU. A central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in Sarajevo is to be operated jointly by&#13;
the State-level Ministry of Finance and the new MAWF and is scheduled to continue operations for an&#13;
initial period of 12 months, to be extended using Government resources if required for project&#13;
completion. The PIU is headed by a Director (12 m/m) and would include two Logistics officers (12&#13;
m/m each). The PIU would also have four Staff Assistants, including a project accountant (total of 48&#13;
m/m). During the initial procurement phase, the PIU would engage two domestic Farm Mechanization&#13;
experts (6 m/m each), two Livestock specialists (6 in/m each), and two Veterinary advisors (3 m/m each).&#13;
The PIU would be supported by internationally recruited staff including a Farm Mechanization Adviser&#13;
(6 m/m), a Livestock Procurement Adviser (6 m/m), an Animal Health Expert (3 m/m), a Financial&#13;
Controller (6 m/m), and a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist (6 m/m).&#13;
83.   Procurement Agents. Procurement of project items would be initiated at the earliest possible&#13;
time. The farm mechanization advisor to the PIU will be recruited by April 1996, using Dutch grant&#13;
funds. Based on the existing technical specifications for farm equipment to be imported under the project,&#13;
bidding documents are being developed by domestic procurement advisors that are already in place under&#13;
the above-mentioned ERP which is in implementation since early March 1996. Arrangements will be&#13;
made to engage an experienced domestic or international trade firm as Procurement Agents (PAs), or a&#13;
respective joint-venture, by about May 1, 1996. The PAs would work in close collaboration with the&#13;
PIU, as well as with technical staff at MAWF and project. implementation staff at the Canton level.&#13;
84.   RIUs. In the Federation of BH, project implementation in the regions will be under the&#13;
responsibility of the (to-be-created) Canton departments of agriculture, water resources and forestry,&#13;
coordinated through four Regional Implementation Units (RlUs) at the Canton level in Bihac, Mostar,&#13;
Tuzla and Zenica. Two additional regional units at the District level would be established in the&#13;
Republika Srpska, following very close coordination with the international donor community and in&#13;
consultation with key institutions of the peace process, including the Office of the High Representative;&#13;
RIU-related funds have been budgeted for this purpose under the project to allow for quick start-up of&#13;
these 2 additional RIUs. RIUs will each be headed by a Director (8 m/m) and would be supported by&#13;
one professional Technical Expert (8 m/m), two Staff Assistants (8 m/m each), and an internationally&#13;
recruited Regional Project Officer (8 m/m). The RIUs would cover project activities in those neighboring&#13;
Cantons which do not have an RIU. RIUs are scheduled to operate for an initial period of about 8&#13;
months, to be extended using Government resources if required to complete project implementation.&#13;

85.    Municipalities. Final distribution of imported farm equipment and livestock will be carried out&#13;
through and by the municipalities. A two-stage selection process will be followed to select ultimate&#13;
beneficiaries under the project, as follows:  Based on farm  damage and needs surveys in each&#13;
municipality, a group of municipalities with heavy war damage to agricultural production will be selected&#13;
by the PIU to participate in the project. The imported items will be allocated by the PIU to specific&#13;
municipalities within this group. Subsequently, each of the selected municipalities will be in charge to&#13;
identify interested and eligible private farmers within their community to obtain the goods and livestock&#13;
provided under the project (the agreed farmer eligibility criteria are described further below).  In&#13;
coordination with and under supervision by the RIUs, municipalities will select these farmers, and&#13;
organize the final delivery of goods and livestock against signature of supply and credit agreements.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
86.    Project Implementation Schedule. To allow for swift implementation of this emergency-type&#13;
operation, procedures for project implementation have to be kept highly straightforward. The two main&#13;
project activities are procurement and distribution of farm machinery and livestock. In order to secure&#13;
early arrival and expedient distribution of procured items, a detailed Project Implementation Schedule has&#13;
been developed and is attached as Appendix 2. The early start of project activities will ensure that many&#13;
project items can already be utilized for the 1996 summer harvest and fall planting season. The project&#13;
is designed to allow for comp!etion of all activities relating to procurement and distribution within a 12-15&#13;
month time frame.&#13;
87.    Recruitment of local project staff and the setting up of the PIU and the RIUs has already started,&#13;
and would be finalized as soon as the new MAWF is fully operational. In order to ensure an early start&#13;
of activities, some of the international staff positions may be filled through alternative interim funding&#13;
(such as donor trust fund arrangements, if available) until the project is approved and the Bank Credit&#13;
as well as donor funding becomes available. Some grant resources of the Dutch Government have&#13;
already been made available. Identification of potential beneficiaries, following an agreed set of criteria,&#13;
has also been initiated. This will start through an overall damage assessment in all 60+ municipalities&#13;
of the Federation, which would be the basis for an emergency needs assessment and for the selection of&#13;
municipalities to be included under the project. In parallel, RIUs will initiate the identification of dealers&#13;
for farm machinery distribution, and of farmers as mechanization and livestock recipients.&#13;
88.    Farm machinery. For farm machinery, preparation of tender documents is underway through a&#13;
team of domestic procurement advisors (in place under the ERP), based on the list of equipment and&#13;
technical specifications already established. International Competitive Bidding, Limited International&#13;
Bidding, and International Shopping will be used. Tender documents will include provision for delivery&#13;
of equipment through transport agents to delivery depots at the four RIU locations. From there,&#13;
machinery will be delivered, via the selected local dealers, to recipient farmers through in-kind credit&#13;
arrangements at concessional terms (10 year maturity, 2 years grace, up to 2 percent interest, based on&#13;
DEM import value of items). RIUs would develop and provide standardized, simple supply and credit&#13;
agreements. Credit repayment would be through local credit institutions, selected based on their fees and&#13;
quality of service in handling accounts for the PIU/RIUs. No equipment would be distributed to State-&#13;
owned farms or enterprises (more than 50 percent of capital in State ownership).&#13;
89.    Supply and credit agreements. Disbursements under the Bank Credit for farm equipment will&#13;
start once the PIU will have entered into supply and credit agreements with eligible farmers representing&#13;
at least 10 percent of the value of farm equipment to be financed by the Bank Credit. The specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 28 of 34&#13;
eligibility criteria for farmers mentioned further below will apply. The supply and credit agreements will&#13;
set out: (i) the value of the goods supplied, based on the import value, expressed in convertible currency;&#13;
(ii) the total value of the supply and credit agreement, not to exceed US$ 250,000 equivalent per&#13;
agreement; (iii) the fact that the in-kind credit carries low interest (up to 2 percent) and no other charges;&#13;
(iv) the need for the borrower to obtain adequate guarantees and collateral; (v) the credit term (for farm&#13;
equipment: 10 years maturity, 2 years of grace); (vi) credit repayment arrangements through local credit&#13;
institutions; and (vii) requirements for adequate servicing and storage of items, including the need to&#13;
maintain service and performance records.&#13;
90.    Livestock importation. Detailed specifications for imported livestock (cattle, goats and sheep)&#13;
have been established. Tender documents will be prepared by the PIU/PA with assistance of the&#13;
international livestock expert. Selected pre-qualified livestock agents will carry out a market survey to&#13;
identify suitable international suppliers of livestock. The selected livestock would be inspected on-site&#13;
by a team including representatives of the PA and MAWF, including the expatriate Livestock&#13;
Procurement Advisor to the PIU. Tender documents would specify delivery in two groups in May/June&#13;
and in September/October of 1996, to ensure that livestock is arriving during suitable weather conditions;&#13;
international delivery would be to specified at quarantine stations in the four RIU locations. By end-April&#13;
1996, quarantine stations will need to have been identified and prepared for this delivery up-front by&#13;
MAWF and PIU staff. Final delivery of livestock to eligible farmers would be arranged through local&#13;
veterinarians, with RIU staff finalizing the in-kind credit arrangements (repayment to RIUs through the&#13;
first female off-spring of equal quality; no interest). Local veterinarians will provide subsequent&#13;
extension to recipient farmers, to be paid for by the farmers themselves.&#13;
91.    Pramenka sheep. The local production and delivery of Pramenka sheep will be arranged in close&#13;
cooperation with local farmers associations such as the Association of Private Farmers in Travnik. They&#13;
will identify suitable producers of lambs and inform them of the possibility to rear lambs for sale for&#13;
breeding rather than slaughter. Procurement of lambs will be arranged through pre-arranged market days&#13;
for this purpose, where inspection of lambs by veterinarians and procurement by staff from RIUs and PAs&#13;
would take place. The procured lambs will be delivered to eligible farmers through the farmers&#13;
associations in close cooperation with the RIUs and local veterinarians. The latter will provide required&#13;
extension advice. Lambs would be distributed to farmers in the same vicinity as they were produced&#13;
since Pramenka sheep are sensitive to changes in locality. The same in-kind credit arrangements would&#13;
be used as for imported livestock.&#13;
92.    Veterinary drugs and equipment. civil works.  The procurement of veterinary drugs and&#13;
equipment, including for Al services, would be based on an established list of items. Preparation of&#13;
tender documents will be carried out by PIU/PA, with assistance by the expatriate Veterinary Expert to&#13;
the PIU. Veterinary equipment will be delivered to RIU depots for further delivery to relevant veterinary&#13;
stations. Drugs and vaccines will be delivered from RIU depots to veterinary stations against in-kind&#13;
credit arrangements at 3 months maturity, with no interest, while equipment for veterinary stations will&#13;
have concessional terms (2 year maturity, no interest). The rehabilitation of veterinary stations through&#13;
building repairs would be based on a simplified survey of required civil works for each station. RIUs&#13;
would pay directly to the contractors. These works are grants for veterinary stations. Equipment&#13;
supplied to veterinary institutes would be grants as well.&#13;

Procurement&#13;
94.    The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below and are in line with&#13;
the agreed procedures for "Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Procurement under Emergency&#13;
Projects", as issued by the Bosnia Ad-hoc Advisory Committee on January 4, 1996. The proposed&#13;
project procurement plan is attached in Appendix 3. In case of parallel financing (such as funding by the&#13;
European Commission, IFAD, or by bilateral donors), the applicable procurement procedures of the&#13;
respective financiers would be applied. To respond in a timely fashion to the post-war emergency&#13;
situation in BH, the below-described procurement methods would be used.&#13;

See Appendix 3 for more details on procurement packages.&#13;
c   Consultant services consist of a number of individual consultants. Their services would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines&#13;
which shall include both competition and sole sourcing. The sole sourcing would be justified in each case.&#13;
d   Commercial services would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both competition and sole sourcing. The&#13;
sole sourcing would be justified in each case. Given the emergency nature of the project, services of procurement agents may be procured&#13;
through direct, separate negotiations with a few qualified agents.&#13;
e   Incremental operating cost include office rent, utilities, and incremental local staff cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 31 of 34&#13;
95.   Goods. For goods, the following procurement procedures will be followed:&#13;
(a) ICB.  For procurement packages estimated to cost more than US$ 5 million each, simplified&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used. Regarding advertisement, a General&#13;
Procurement Notice (GPN) has been published in the Development Business in March 1996&#13;
(the GPN is attached in Appendix 4). This notice includes information about the nature of&#13;
goods and services to be procured and invites interested and eligible suppliers to send their&#13;
expression of interest to the PIU. The GPN will also be published in the local press. The&#13;
GPN will be followed by specific advertisements for individual contracts in the local press.&#13;
Bidding documents will be sent to suppliers who respond to the GPN. For ICB packages,&#13;
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used, to be customized by the PIU and&#13;
approved by the Bank prior to bidding. The period allowed for submission of bids may be&#13;
reduced to four weeks. Bid and payment currency will be limited to one currency widely&#13;
used in international trade.&#13;
(b) LIB.  Limited International Bidding (LIB), tendering by invitation, will be used for procurement&#13;
packages estimated to cost over US$ 2 million and up to US$ 5 million each. Exceptions to&#13;
this threshold will be applied in cases where there will be only a limited number of suppliers.&#13;
The List of LIB bidders will be based on the expressions of interest received in response to&#13;
the GPN as well as other sources, such as PAs' own experience, etc. The list will be as&#13;
broad as possible. Geographical distribution will be considered to the maximum extent&#13;
possible. For LIB packages, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will be used. In order&#13;
to gain speed, LIB bidding documents will be sent by fax and bidders will be allowed to send&#13;
their bids by fax as well. However, the PIU and the PAs will be required to put in place a&#13;
mechanism, satisfactory to the Bank, to ensure transparency and fairness and to avoid any&#13;
manipulation of bids received by fax. LIB contracts will require prior approval of the Bank&#13;
relating to the list of suppliers and technical specifications.&#13;
(c) IS/NS. International Shopping (IS) will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard&#13;
specification commodities, estimated to cost between US$ 200,000 and US$ 2 million per&#13;
contract. IS procedures are based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three suppliers in two countries. An IS document, including contract conditions, has been&#13;
prepared and will be used for IS contracts. National Shopping (NS) will be used for goods&#13;
available within BH, such as office furniture and supplies, up to an estimated cost of US$&#13;
200,000 per contract with at least three quotations from national suppliers.&#13;
96.   Consultant and commercial services, incremental operating cost. Consultant and commercial&#13;
services will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both cotnpetition and&#13;
sole sourcing. Given the emergency nature of the project, services of procurement agents may be&#13;
procured through direct, separate negotiations with a few qualified agents, as there are only a limited&#13;
number of contracts that could be handled at minimum cost. Sole sourcing of services should be justified&#13;
in each case. Such justification may be the timing constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and lack of&#13;
candidates given the situation in BH. No assignments have been pre-identified for sole sourcing. Any&#13;
sole sourcing during implementation will be subject to the Bank's approval. Follow-up assignments will&#13;
be permissible to the extent that this will be indicated in the initial Terms of Reference for assignments.&#13;
Incremental operating cost, such office rent, utilities, and incremental local staff cost, would be procured&#13;
in accordance with local practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 32 of 34&#13;
97.   Use of specialized agencies of the United Nations. The services of the United Nations specialized&#13;
agencies can be engaged on a sole-source basis for those items which are in their programs. For the&#13;
proposed project, this may apply to expert consultant services in the agriculture sector offered by FAO.&#13;
Speed and reasonableness of price should be considered when contracting these agencies.&#13;
98.   Procurement implementation capacity. As the Recipient of the funds is likely to be short of the&#13;
capacity essential for carrying out procurement of goods and services in the timely manner required, the&#13;
services of procurement agents (PAs) would be engaged to assist the PIU in this task. The PAs would&#13;
be responsible for carrying out all procurement of goods in accordance with the agreed procedures. The&#13;
PAs would also be responsible for carrying out inspections of delivered goods and for certifying payments&#13;
in accordance with contract conditions. The individual procurement advisors in the PIU would be&#13;
responsible for day-to-day coordination of procurement work. They would be responsible for contract&#13;
management and supervision, and for cooperation with the World Bank and PAs. Procurement training&#13;
of PIU staff is included under the project.&#13;
99.   Prior and post Bank review of procurement documents. Bank Standard Bidding Documents will&#13;
be used for ICB and LIB procurement packages. The Bank has also prepared the invitation to quote and&#13;
contract document for IS. These documents will be used for procurement under the project. For LIB&#13;
below US$ 5 million and IS, the documents and awards would not require any further prior reviews by&#13;
the Bank. Technical specifications and data sheets of ICB documents, and documents for LIB above US$&#13;
5 million, will require prior Bank review and approval. For consultants' contracts, the Bank's standard&#13;
form of consultant contracts would be used. Consultant contracts exceeding US$ 100,000 per contract&#13;
for firms and US$ 50,000 per contract for individuals will require prior Bank review of budgets, short-&#13;
lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals received, evaluation reports and contracts. Sole&#13;
source contracts not included in the procurement plan would be subject to the Bank's prior approval.&#13;
100.  Post reviews of procurement actions will be carried out on a quarterly basis by Bank supervision&#13;
missions. Furthermore, post review monitoring of procurement will be facilitated through quarterly&#13;
reporting, which will be part of the regular quarterly progress reports described further below. These&#13;
reports would include, inter alia, the type of items and value of procurement packages, the kind of&#13;
procurement method followed, the numbers and values of bids received, the name of the winning&#13;
supplier, as well as the key dates of the bidding, award and contract completion process.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
101.  The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Appendix 1. Disbursements are expected&#13;
to be completed within a period of two years from the date of effectiveness. The project and the Bank&#13;
Credit would finance the categories of expenditures outlined in the table below.&#13;
102.  Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Recipient would establish a&#13;
Special Account in the central bank or a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. The Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be US$ 4.0 million, representing about&#13;
three to four months (average) of the Bank's share of estimated expenditures expected to be paid from&#13;
the Special Account. Therefore, for this emergency operation, the standard limit for the Authorized&#13;
Allocation of 10 percent of the Credit amount would be exceeded, to take account of the expected rapid&#13;
pace of disbursement. Under the same rationale, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be&#13;
equal to the Authorized Allocation of US$ 4.0 million. Replenishment applications would be forwarded&#13;
to the Bank monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 33 of 34&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described&#13;
in the Bank's Disbursement Handbook, Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account&#13;
which have been reconciled by the Recipient would accompany all replenishment requests. For large&#13;
contracts of farm equipment, the Bank would make direct payments to suppliers. The minimum size of&#13;
application for direct withdrawal from the Credit account, or for issuance of a Special Commitment, will&#13;
be 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation to the Special Account.&#13;

103.  Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) for goods-related contracts of up to US$ 5.0 million equivalent, for which detailed documents&#13;
evidencing expenditures will be reviewed by the PIU and made available for the required audit as well&#13;
as to Bank supervision missions. Disbursements for contracts exceeding US$ 5.0 million equivalent&#13;
would be made against presentation to the Bank of full contract documentation. In the case of contracts&#13;
for consultant services, the SOE contract limit will be US$ 100,000 equivalent for firms and US$ 50,000&#13;
equivalent for individual experts.  The SOE limit for contracts for commercial services and for&#13;
expenditures relating to incremental operating cost will be US$ 100,000. The project completion date&#13;
would be December 31, 1997.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
104.  Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established with the PIU within MAWF/&#13;
the State Ministry of Finance. These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the Bank&#13;
Credit with copies of all disbursement requests and underlying documentation; (ii) a record of transactions&#13;
on the Special Account and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical assistance to&#13;
the PIU has been included under the project to establish proper accounts and financial controlling&#13;
procedures.&#13;
105.  Audits. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors and under terms&#13;
of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account&#13;
and for Statement of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 34 of 34&#13;
six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year after they&#13;
have been audited.&#13;
106.  Reporting. The PIU will prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly progress report showing&#13;
the status of implementation of the project, including summary information on procurement contracts,&#13;
as well as a financial report in a format acceptable to the Bank. The detailed outline of the quarterly&#13;
progress reports has been agreed during Credit Negotiations.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
107.  Project implementation would incorporate a large degree of flexibility in view of the fact that it&#13;
will need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances in the country. Implementation progress would be&#13;
formally evaluated at mid-term, i.e. approximately 6 months after effectiveness. In addition, during the&#13;
first 6 months of implementation, the Bank's new Resident Mission in Sarajevo would continuously&#13;
supervise all initial project implementation steps, and would assist closely on matters requiring advice and&#13;
rapid decisions by the Bank. In particular, procurement and disbursements would require intensive&#13;
supervision, given the flexibilities built in implementation. The PIU would collect data from the RIUs&#13;
which would compile short monthly activity and progress reports.&#13;
Agreements Reached&#13;
108.  During negotiations, the following agreements have been reached: The State Ministry of Finance,&#13;
as Recipient, represented through the PIU, will allocate project funds for the purchase of goods, works&#13;
and services, according to the project design. The Recipient will maintain the PIU and regional&#13;
implementation units with adequate staffing to ensure timely and orderly project implementation. Farm&#13;
mechanized equipment financed under the Credit will be supplied to farmers selected in accordance with&#13;
the agreed priority and eligibility criteria for project beneficiaries. Supply and credit agreements between&#13;
the PIU and beneficiaries will be used. These agreements will be limited to US$250,000 each and will&#13;
specify: the value of the equipment, expressed in convertible currency; the interest charge of up to 2&#13;
percent per annum; the term of the credits of up to ten years maturity and two years of grace; credit&#13;
guarantees or collateral provided by the beneficiary; credit repayment arrangements through local credit&#13;
institutions; and requirements for adequate servicing and storage facilities as well as for maintenance of&#13;
service and performance records. Project accounting, audits and reporting will be carried out in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Emergency Farm
            Reconstruction Project are to jump-start agricultural
            production, improve food security, and create employment and
            income for the war-affected rural population including
            returning displaced persons. The project comprises the
            following components: (a) farm mechanization will provide
            motor-cultivators and tractors, replacement of lost
            tractors, replacement of selected combine harvesters, and
            provision of related technical assistance and training; (b)
            livestock production will assist in rebuilding the national
            herds for milk and meat production, through the import of
            cattle, goats and sheep; (c) animal health services will
            help strengthen veterinary services by equipping and
            rebuilding private veterinary stations, and provide
            equipment; and (d) project implementation will assist with
            start-up and will implement the project through provision of
            equipment, technical assistance, training and studies, and
            through financing of incremental recurrent expenditures.
