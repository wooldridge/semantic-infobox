EL SALVADOR&#13;
PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN (PSM-TAL)&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1. El Salvador's recent history has been characterized by civil war, economic and political instability&#13;
and cumulative problems in the social sectors. Since the 1992 Peace Accord the overall situation of the&#13;
country is improving. The Government of El Salvador has managed stabilization and transition effectively&#13;
and economic growth has been reactivated. Consolidation of peace and democratic decision making, as&#13;
well as fostering private sector-led growth, will now require continuous deepening of the reform process.&#13;
It will also require attacking the economic and political roots of the conflict in an orderly, participatory&#13;
and consensus-based manner.&#13;
2. Such pressing needs for consolidating reforms and building up new confidence, however, will impose&#13;
a heavy burden on traditional public sector institutions which are presently unprepared to manage such&#13;
change (see Box I for an overview of the public sector). Despite considerable political and economic&#13;
progress in the past years, El Salvador's public sector still suffers from major structural weaknesses and&#13;
deficiencies: (i) high functional inefficiencies caused by overdimension and centralization of the state; (ii)&#13;
low economy and efficiency caused by its current organizational structure, its extremely weak financial&#13;
and human resources management, and the low professionalization of its civil service; (iii) poor service&#13;
delivery; and (iv) outdated and inadequate administrative infrastructure and equipment.&#13;
3. These weak inherited structures which resulted from the non-market interactions and oligopolistic&#13;
competition that dominated the economy in the past decades, are obstacles to fostering a more competi-&#13;
tive export oriented economy led by the private sector and attractive to foreign investment, and reducing&#13;
widespread poverty. As currently structured, public sector institutions are likely to hinder these goals:&#13;
directly, through overregulation and protection of monopolistic public enterprises, the public sector&#13;
generates prohibitively high costs for market entry and crowds out private, innovative competitors; and&#13;
indirectly, through bureaucratic inefficiency and overly complex administrative procedures. The sector's&#13;
inability to deliver adequate services, notably in the social sectors, increases political insecurity and&#13;
instability. In short, the public sector's institutional deficiencies pose the risk of major setbacks in both&#13;
policy making and implementation of public sector reforms before broader private sector participation in&#13;
development can gain sufficient momentum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Reforms are needed to&#13;
Box I. The Public Sector in El Salvador is divided into the non-&#13;
*  tailor the structure of Government to   financial public sector (NFPS) and nine financial institutions. The&#13;
the evolving fanctions of the State;     NFPS encompasses: (a) the Central Government including the&#13;
strengthen                               Eathe financial management   Legislative, the Judiciary, the Electoral Organism; as well as the&#13;
*  stregthenthe fnancla  manaement Executive with the Presidency (Presidencia), its S secretariats, a&#13;
and accountability  of public sector   Ministerial Council, and 14 ministries; (b) a group of institutions&#13;
agencies;                                consisting of 35 autonomous entities, the public hospitals, and the&#13;
.  realign   public   sector   incentive    municipalities in 14 administrative departments;  and (c)  6&#13;
structures;                              public enterprises. The autonomous entities and public enterprises&#13;
. avoid  overap o misiare within ministerial portfolios of responsibility. Three of the&#13;
*  avoid  overlap   of  missions  and    autonomous institutions and one public enterprise (ANTEL, the&#13;
functions of Government entities;        telecommunications company) fall under the authority of the&#13;
*  reduce redundant staff and increase    Presidency (see organization chart of the Executive in Annex D).&#13;
the ratio of professional/technical to        Public expenditures related to GDP are within the average&#13;
support staff,                           for low- and middle-income countries. Together with Guatemala&#13;
*  strengthen  and  provide  alternative   they are the lowest in Central America.  In 1994, public&#13;
expenditures including net lending amounted to 14.2% of GDP&#13;
means of delivering public services.     for the Central Government and 17.5% for the NFPS, compared&#13;
with 16.2% and 20.1% in 1992. The projections for 1995 are&#13;
4.  The new  Government, which took    13.8% and 17.7%, respectively. 1996 Budget plans are 14.1% and&#13;
office on June  1, 1994, has therefore    18.2% respectively.&#13;
declared  public  sector  modernization          Of the public expenditures, current expenditures on wages&#13;
(PSM) to be one of its key development   and salaries and goods and services account for more than half of&#13;
policy objectives. Several public speeches    NFPS spending (55% in 1994, a projected 53.2 % for 1995, and a&#13;
of the President of the Republic reaf-   budgeted 56.5 % for 1996). Outlays on wages in the NFPS&#13;
amounted to 7.1% of GDP in 1994 (projected 7.0% for 1995 and&#13;
firmed the need to accelerate PSM during    1996). Central Government wages accounts for 5.3% and 5.6% of&#13;
1996 in key areas like privatization, de-   GDP (projected for 1995 and 1996, respectively).&#13;
and re-regulation, institutional reform and      Despite the fact that, at first sight, El Salvador's NFPS does&#13;
human and financial resources develop-   not appear particularly oversized, there are some worrying&#13;
ment.                                       features related to its performance. The Government anticipates&#13;
that the complex structure of its public sector will not allow it to&#13;
5.  Under  the  Government's  Public   respond in an adequate and timely manner to the country's&#13;
economic and social priorities.  Distortions, overlaps, and&#13;
Sector Modermization Program, the State   inefficiencies exist in the definition of responsibilities; the&#13;
will withdraw  from  intervention in and    functions and size of the entities; and the quantity and&#13;
direct production of goods and services   Tcomposition of staff needed to deliver public services. A number&#13;
which can be produced more efficiently   of activities undertaken by the Government are now obsolete or&#13;
by the private sector. Of necessity, it will   better served by the private sector. Others could be carried out&#13;
bmore efficiently by decentralized levels of Government.&#13;
be much leaner, yet stronger In ItS&#13;
Some 140,000 people work in the public sector (some 10%&#13;
capacity  to  formulate, Implement and   C0of total non-agricultural employment): 90,000 in the Central&#13;
oversee  economic  policies, and  much    Government, 51,000 in the Autonomous Institutions (see Annex&#13;
more efficient and effective in delivering    F). The composition of employment indicates a combination of&#13;
services.  Above  all  the  State  will   overstaffimg - particularly in the lower ranks - and understaffing&#13;
concentrate on facilitating private sector   at the same time, particularly at professional level. With the sharp&#13;
led  development. Central Government   drop in real wages (1993 real monthly wages had dropped to&#13;
about 34% of their 1980 level), public sector incomes have&#13;
functions will be pared down to a set of   deteriorated. Yet, paradoxically, public wages at the lower end are&#13;
strategic economic and social manage-   still competitive compared to those in the private sector, while&#13;
ment tasks, including: (a) managing the    professional salariesare not.&#13;
country's financial and human resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
more effectively and efficiently, achieving greater transparency and responsiveness, and strengthening&#13;
capacities to formulate and implement public policies, with specific focus on poverty reduction and&#13;
environmental protection; (b) designing, implementing, and overseeing a legal and regulatory framework&#13;
that assures free and open competition and efficiency in markets, and the rule of law in civil society; (c)&#13;
leading and fostering the country's integration with the world economy; and (d) delivering or contracting&#13;
for delivery of only those services with "public good" attributes that the private sector cannot alone&#13;
provide in sufficient quantity and with sufficient quality and access.&#13;
6. Most of the ministries participating in the PSMP have set up Reform Groups responsible for&#13;
implementing ministry-wide modernization policies. These Reform Groups are closely coordinated with&#13;
the PSMP in the CPMSP. Strengthening these groups will allow for carrying out gradually and ade-&#13;
quately modernization efforts in each ministry.&#13;
Ongoing Public Sector Reform&#13;
7. In November 1995, the President appointed a minister-ranked 'Comisionado Presidencial para la&#13;
Modernizaci6n del Sector PuTblico' to lead and coordinate the Governments' public sector modernization&#13;
activities in different Government entities. Politically, inter-ministerial cooperation and coordination are&#13;
achieved by the Commissioner through the 'Comisi6n Presidencial para la Modernizaci6n del Sector&#13;
Publico (CPMSP), which includes the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economy. Technically,&#13;
modernization activities are coordinated and guided by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Each&#13;
ministry, in turn, has its own reform groups ('Grupos de Reforma') that are responsible for implementing&#13;
and micro-managing modernization activities (see also Section B, Project Administration and Implemen-&#13;
tation).&#13;
8. There is evidence of broad support both in the private sector as in the National Assembly for such&#13;
reforms. Although still fragmented and with different connotations, most parties agree on the need to&#13;
carry out PSM in order to sustain and broaden achieved progress, and implement sound policies that&#13;
reduce poverty. The CPMSP will play a key role in providing a coherent framework for PSM and&#13;
enabling consensus building on essential features of the reform process.&#13;
9. PSM efforts can build upon previous and in-debt discussions with the Government particularly in the&#13;
context of 1995 Country Economic Memorandum ('El Salvador: Meeting the Challenge of Globaliza-&#13;
tion', Report No.: 14109-ES) and the Bank's newly approved Competitiveness Enhancement Technical&#13;
Assistance Project (Ln. 3946-ES). PSM and PSD efforts are thus well coordinated and most likely to lead&#13;
to synergy during implementation.&#13;
10. The Government has expressed strong interest in advancing rapidly with the implementation of a&#13;
Public Sector Modernization Program (PSMP) to be supported by the proposed Public Sector Moderni-&#13;
zation Technical Assistance Loan (PSM-TAL), and provide the necessary institutional setting and staff to&#13;
carry out reforms in Central Government agencies. Prepared under an ongoing Bank supported TAL (Ln.&#13;
3648-ES), a Government approved Modernization Plan would guide implementation. The proposed&#13;
PSM-TAL is scheduled to be fully co-financed with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The&#13;
IDB would, additionally, provide special contributions to hire professional staff, and an additional quick&#13;
disbursing loan that would allow to cover short-term financial needs during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
11. The Government's new vision of the State is reflected in a detailed Modernization Plan (Programa&#13;
de Modernizaci6n del Sector Puiblico, May 1996). The Plan includes (a) the institutional structure of the&#13;
executive branch of the public sector for the next five years, (b) a redefinition of the role of the State and&#13;
its functions, (c) the role and functions of each sectoral ministry, (d) macro-institutional and micro-&#13;
institutional restructuring priorities, including definition of restructuring goals (with efficiency-enhancing&#13;
measures), and identification of those areas that will be decentralized or privatized, (e) general require-&#13;
ments of human and financial resources, and fiscal impact, and (f) a timetable for developing and&#13;
implementing institutional restructuring plans at the entity level.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
12. The objective of the PSM-TAL is to strengthen the Government's capacities to implement its Public&#13;
Sector Modernization Program (PSMP), i.e. defining a more subsidiary role for the public sector;&#13;
gradually improving its performance, accountability and transparency; and enhancing private sector&#13;
development. For this purpose, the proposed project seeks to assist the Government in three interrelated&#13;
areas: (a) define the new roles of the public sector; (b) strengthen operations for those entities that remain&#13;
in the public sector; and (c) involve the private sector in the provision of public services. A PPF advance&#13;
of US$1.9 million (P279-ES) is supporting start-up activities.'&#13;
Project Description&#13;
13. The proposed PSM-TAL has the following four components: Institutional Restructuring and&#13;
Debureaucratization; Human Resource Management; Financial Resource Management; and Privatization&#13;
and Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Public Services.&#13;
14. The project would complement: (i) other Bank projects that support sectoral organizational and&#13;
institutional strengthening (e.g. in the Ministries of Education and Health where it would provide some of&#13;
the necessary administrative/normative frameworks), as well as ongoing efforts to improving private&#13;
sector development (e.g. through the Competitiveness Enhancement Technical Assistance Project, Ln.&#13;
3946-ES, FY96); (ii) USAID and IDB support in the areas of integrated financial management and&#13;
tax/customs administration; and (iii) efforts by other donors, e.g. GTZ, UNDP and USAID, in related&#13;
areas of modernization, particularly in decentralization and municipal strengthening.&#13;
The IDB is processing in parallel an adjustment operation for public sector modernization in support of the Govern-&#13;
ment's PSMP.&#13;

Institutional Restructuring and Debureaucratization&#13;
(estimated US$ 5.3 million, 11% of project costs)2&#13;
Issues&#13;
15. The present structure of the public sector is outdated and a major obstacle to the effective&#13;
implementation of economic and social policies. The public sector continues to monopolize the delivery&#13;
of the bulk of the country's infrastructure services as well as a large number of functions that could be&#13;
performed more efficiently by the private sector. Ministries and their dependent agencies do not have a&#13;
clear definition of mission, and have yet to shed unnecessary functions, and to reorganize others, to&#13;
deliver high-priority services more efficiently. Some functions are overstaffed while others are under-&#13;
resourced and bereft of essential skills. There are no established norms to govern the organizational&#13;
structure of the different areas within ministries, and no single entity is responsible for rationalizing&#13;
structures. It is a common practice in some ministries to modify their internal organization ad hoc and&#13;
assign new functions that, eventually, overlap with those of other public sector entities. Managers are not&#13;
held accountable for the allocation of human and financial resources, nor for the results obtained with&#13;
these resources. The current civil service legislation has distorted the labor market by making staff&#13;
mobility difficult and facilitating bad workers to remain in the public sector. As a result of all these weak-&#13;
nesses, the public sector is excessively bureaucratic, and this constitutes a barrier to private sector develop-&#13;
ment.&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
16. With assistance from consultants financed by the TAL and UNDP, the Government prepared a draft&#13;
Public Sector Modernization Program (PSMP), in which institutional restructuring is given prime&#13;
importance. In addition, institutional restructuring studies for pilot ministries (Public Works, Agriculture,&#13;
and Finance) were carried out. With the exception of the Public Works study (see Box 1I), however, the&#13;
recommendations of the studies were not clear nor detailed enough in the new objectives and functional&#13;
roles of the entities to be able to draw from them the next steps needed to implement the program. The&#13;
Government made explicit its commitment to a subsidiary role of the State in its draft 1994-1999&#13;
Economic and Social Plan which sets the stage for decentralizing or privatizing certain activities that are&#13;
now being carried out by central ministries. With assistance from the Bank, the Government prepared&#13;
institutional restructuring guidelines and terms of reference for consultancies that will (a) develop an&#13;
overall assessment and 'fiapping" of the public sector, (b) propose a new macroinstitutional structure&#13;
that will eliminate functional inconsistencies and overlaps, and (c) formulate proposals for the restructur-&#13;
ing and modernization of selected Ministries and decentralized institutions. It is envisaged that activities&#13;
(a) and (b) will be completed within the next month and a half, with assistance from consultants to be&#13;
financed with remaining funds of the TAL.&#13;

17. In dialogue with different Ministers, the   Box I: A  Case for Institutional Restructuring: the&#13;
CPMSP, and, eventually, the President have   Minist  of Public Works. A  good example for the&#13;
selected the followig . e fr il   institutional restructuring exercises currently needed in El&#13;
selected the following Ministries for institutional   Salvador's PSM is the Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio&#13;
restructuring: Presidency, Economy, External   de Obras Publicas, MOP). At present, MOP, which consists&#13;
Affairs, Public Works, Transport and Housing,   of three Vice-ministries (Public Works, Housing and Urban&#13;
Education, Health, Agriculture, and Finance.   Development, and Transport), is heavily involved in&#13;
Moreover, the  Government foresees institu-   executing road construction and maintenance, including&#13;
rural roads. Previous studies indicate that the missions and&#13;
fimctions within MOP are vaguely defined and that overlap&#13;
three decentralized institutions to be identified.   between the different units has increased considerably. MOP&#13;
Each  of the  selected  entities  selected  for   employs some 13,700 staff, out of which 3,000 are&#13;
institutional   restructuring    will   produce   administrative  and  professional  staff.  Some  10,100&#13;
institutional restructuring  plans (IRPs) with   employees are daily wage laborers (Jornaleros) with&#13;
specific actions and timetables for increasing the   temporary  contracts, yet with  de facto  permanent&#13;
entities' efficiency, reducing their size and fiscal   employment status despite irregular work load. Some 2-3&#13;
percent of the Jornaleros are beyond the maximum age&#13;
burden, rationalizing their organizational and   allowed by law to remain in the public sector (70 years).&#13;

19. Measures to  reduce  overstaffing  began&#13;
under the previous Government with voluntary retirement programs in 1991-93 (at the national level) and&#13;
in 1993 (in the Ministry of Agriculture and through the law that created the National Agricultural&#13;
Technology Center). However, these early measures did not discriminate between essential and non-&#13;
essential positions, and the Government lacked the technical and political capacity to control recruitment&#13;
and the creation of new posts. Moreover, the employment reductions did not proceed from an overall&#13;
vision of the role of the State and a clear definition of its functions. In a new effort to reduce overstaffing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
the Government established a new law on October 12, 1995, 'Decreto 471" (see Box III) that had a&#13;
much broader impact.&#13;
20. With assistance from the Bank, the Government prepared institutional restructuring guidelines and&#13;
terms of reference for consultancies that (a) developed an overall assessment and 'inapping" of the public&#13;
sector, (b) proposed a new macroinstitutional structure that will eliminate functional inconsistencies and&#13;
overlaps, and (c) formulated proposals for the restructuring and modernization of selected Ministries and&#13;
decentralized institutions. Activities were completed in May 1996 with assistance from consultants&#13;
financed with remaining funds of the TAL. A presentation of these proposals was given to the President&#13;
of the Republic.&#13;
21. The institutional restructuring plans at the entity level will be carried out with assistance from a&#13;
consulting firm to be financed under the proposed project. The starting point of the institutional&#13;
restructuring plans will be the approved Modernization Plan of the PSMP and the outlines for institu-&#13;
tional modernization prepared by each ministry. The institutional restructuring plans for Education,&#13;
Health, and Agriculture will be financed by the respective sectoral project but will be coordinated with&#13;
the PSMP to ensure consistency. It was agreed with the Government that until the institutional restructur-&#13;
ing plans of ministries are approved by the Interministerial Commission, no modification of the internal&#13;
institutional structures will be made until instructed by the Commission. The Government intends to&#13;
embark on modernization in a sequential manner: It would start with a first set of ministries (MINHAC,&#13;
MINEC, MRREE) in late CY 1996, and then set the stage for another group of ministries (MOP,&#13;
MIPRES and three decentralized institutions)3 that would join in early CY 1997.&#13;
22. As a result of institutional restructuring at the macro and microinstitutional levels, the Government&#13;
expects that further, more targeted, employment cuts will be required to enhance overall institutional&#13;
performance. These cuts would result from qualitative 'tight-sizing;" i.e., eliminating or transferring&#13;
functions to the private sector, and avoiding overlaps. It is expected that the contracting out of road&#13;
construction and maintenance services in the Ministry of Public Works alone, would reduce employment&#13;
in that ministry by about 5,000. Moreover, further private sector participation in the provision of public&#13;
services is expected to lead to reductions in employment by another about 2,000 staff. Such further&#13;
institutional restructuring would require an adequate incentive package to ensure acceptance by displaced&#13;
workers. Elements of this package would include:&#13;
* fair and transparent selection process for staff reduction and cancelation of non-essential vacancies;&#13;
* adequate compensation packages;&#13;
additional safeguards to assure that displaced workers would be able to regain their standards of&#13;
living, such as training and/or availability of micro-enterprise credits for displaced workers;&#13;
* open communication channels with interest groups;&#13;
monitoring mechanisms in place to make sure workers who have received severance packages are not&#13;
rehired.&#13;

tor in the PSMP's Technical and Coordination Unit, staff in the Chamber of Commerce, and short-term&#13;
process redesign consultancies. This subcomponent takes into account citizen participation. As a&#13;
strategy of citizen participation - within the Debureaucratization Component - the Project 'El Salvador&#13;
Eficiente" has been developed. It is a joint effort between the public and private sector which hopes to&#13;
identify and simplify, from the users point of view, transactions that affect the development of the private&#13;
firm and of the civil society in general, in order to facilitate the insertion of the country in the globaliza-&#13;
tion process. To facilitate the coordination of the project, the 'Comision El Salvador Eficiente" has been&#13;
formed, made up of high level representatives of the public and private sector, in which the Comisio-&#13;
nado Presidencial will preside. The debureaucratization group has developed a work program and plans&#13;
to undertake rapid diagnostic surveys to pinpoint the nature and magnitude of the problems detected,&#13;
prioritize actions to be taken, and develop implementation plans. In the diagnostic and implementation&#13;
phases, the group will work closely with members of the reform groups in the ministries to ensure strong&#13;
ownership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
26. Most of the ministries participating in the PSMP have set up Reform Groups responsible for&#13;
implementing ministry-wide modernization policies. Each entity under the program will develop an IRP&#13;
with the help of the consultants, and present it to the CPMSP for approval. The specific technical&#13;
assistance that will be required for implementing each IRP will be determined by the Reform Groups in&#13;
each entity, assisted by the IR Component Coordinator. The Institutional Restructuring Component&#13;
Coordinator, assisted by short-term international advisers and long-term local consultants, guide the&#13;
process and regularly discuss progress with the Coordinator of the PCU. The 1R Component Coordinator&#13;
will also coordinate closely with the Privatization Coordinator.&#13;
Human Resources Management&#13;
(estimated US$6.3 million, or 13% of total project costs)&#13;
Issues&#13;
27. Achieving the Government's objective of creating an efficient and productive public sector will&#13;
depend greatly on how it selects, manages, develops and deploys its human resources. Yet after more&#13;
than a decade of neglect during the civil war, human resource management in the public sector is in&#13;
disarray. At the present time, central management of the civil service is a part-time occupation, entrusted&#13;
to an understaffed office in the MINHAC, headed by a director whose primary task is the administration&#13;
of the ministry's own personnel. Low-priority functions and sectors are seriously overstaffed, especially at&#13;
lower levels, while high-priority ones are short of skilled staff. Antiquated regulations prevent managers&#13;
from efficiently redeploying labor. Career development, including plans for upgrading staff skills simply&#13;
do not exist. The pay and grading system - marked by ad-hoc decisions on pay awards, wage&#13;
compression, and large disparities in pay across ministries for posts of very similar content - lowers&#13;
morale and undermines the state's ability to compete with the private sector for skilled people.&#13;
28. Productivity is also low due to uncontrolled growth in the wage bill, which has been crowding out&#13;
spending on essential operations and maintenance inputs - at present, expenditures for wages and salaries&#13;
are consuming close to 70% of recurrent expenditure. Procedures for creating and eliminating posts are&#13;
not well-defined, and the annual budget exercise is not buttressed by a central register of approved posts&#13;
and a system of monthly reporting by ministries of staff in post. As a sign of the magnitude of these&#13;
problems, MINHAC could not until very recently determine with any degree of accuracy how many&#13;
employees were on the payroll, where they were working and what functions they were carrying out.&#13;
TAL assistance provided first assessments in this area (cf para. 33, and Box V).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
29. Recognizing that isolated actions cannot turn around a collapsed civil service system, there is now&#13;
widespread agreement within the Government and outside of it on the need for a comprehensive civil&#13;
service reform program. With the support of the TAL, the Government prepared a plan for such a&#13;
program which has been incorporated into the PSMP. Specifically, that plan focuses on (a) creating the&#13;
Central Government's institutional capacity for administering, monitoring and controlling human&#13;
resources, (b) gradually developing a public service that is adequate in terms of size and quality, and (c)&#13;
establishing the conditions for staff motivation, incentive, and development.&#13;
30. Specifically, the plan calls for (a) implementing an integrated human resource management informa-&#13;
tion system in all central ministries and those 'decentralized institutions' that receive transfers from the&#13;
Central Government, (b) creating a central human resource management entity for the Executive, (c)&#13;
strengthening the human resource management capabilities in operational units within ministries and&#13;
decentralized institutions, (d) reducing public employment to eliminate redundant staff, defining the&#13;
adequate benefits packages needed to retire staff, and developing support programs for affected staff, and&#13;
(e) developing a new legal framework for the civil service.&#13;
31. Human Resources Information System    Box V. The Human Resources hiformaion Sys*em (UM): This&#13;
(HRIS).  To  lay  the  foundation  for   system, developed by the Ministry of Finance, under the assistance&#13;

central office. Budgetary data on approved&#13;
posts has also been loaded onto the system. At the same time, to begin the process of restoring a&#13;
functioning system of manpower controls, HRISs linked to the central system were installed in two pilot&#13;
ministries, Finance and Agriculture.&#13;
32. Nonetheless, the HIRIS still needs to be integrated in permanent fashion with the large number of&#13;
dispersed payroll systems, some of which are still maintained manually. Despite its importance as a critical&#13;
tool for planning and implementing the reform of the State, the HRIS remains in a precarious position,&#13;
and functions of the HRIS office have not been formalized or given legal standing within the structure of&#13;
Government. Senior managers in the ministries, as well as finance and personnel chiefs, are not yet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
familiar with the potential of the system as a management tool. At less senior levels, further development&#13;
of norms and procedures, together with training, is required to integrate the ERIS into the everyday&#13;
business of personnel offices, and thus in the process ensuring the integrity of data transferred to the&#13;
central system.&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL&#13;
33. To support the Government's reform program, the human resources management component of the&#13;
PSM-TAL will finance the following activities: (a) completion and implementation of the HRIS; (b)&#13;
design and development of a grading and remuneration system; (c) design and development of a modem&#13;
human resource policy; (d) support for the establishment of a central human resource management unit;&#13;
(e) institutional strengthening of the ministries' capabilities for human resource management; (f)&#13;
development of a new legal framework for the civil service; and (g) training. Moreover, the PSM-TAL&#13;
will finance TA support to the PSMP Human Resources Management Reform Group. These issues will&#13;
be addressed and financed as follows:&#13;
*  TA Supportfor the Establishment/Improvement of a Central HRM Unit. The PSM-TAL will finance&#13;
high-caliber international experts to help set up a central human resources management modernization&#13;
unit and provide it with expert advice.&#13;
*  Support to the HRM Reform Group. The PSM-TAL will finance long-term expert advice and short-&#13;
term local experts to support the HRM Reform Group Coordinator. Local experts are being financed&#13;
under the PPF.&#13;
*  Human Resources Management Information System. The PSM-TAL will finance consulting services,&#13;
equipment and training to complete the work started under the TAL. The HRIS will be implemented&#13;
in all ministries and decentralized institutions, and the system will be permanently linked with payroll&#13;
and integrated with SAFI. With financing under the PPF, the HRIS currently used by the ministries of&#13;
Finance and Agriculture will be extended to additional ministries, and additional human resource&#13;
management modules will be designed.&#13;
*  Human Resources Management Policy System. This subcomponent would: (i) design and develop a&#13;
grading and remuneration system. This activity will provide consulting services and training to de-&#13;
velop a unified grading and remuneration system for the civil service. A study of salary scale criteria&#13;
for administrative staff is underway, and it is envisaged that under the PPF a diagnostic review of the&#13;
remuneration systems currently in place would be carried out; and (ii) design and develop a modern&#13;
human resource policy. The PSM-TAL will finance consulting services to develop a transparent,&#13;
consistent, and equitable personnel system, consisting of procedures for recruitment, selection, pro-&#13;
motion and dismissal.&#13;
*  Institutional Strengthening of the Ministries' Capabilities in Human Resource Management.&#13;
Institutional strengthening support will be provided to personnel management units in the core minis-&#13;
tries. These units have to be set up and staffed adequately to, eventually, manage human resources at&#13;
ministry level.&#13;
*  Development of a new Legal Frameworkfor the Civil Service. Consultant services for the completion&#13;
of the legal framework (Ley de la Funci6n Publica) is being financed with PPF funds. Since new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
legislation in this area will need to be based on broad political support, special emphasis will be given&#13;
to consensus building measures throughout revision and drafting of the law.&#13;
Training.4 The PSM-TAL will finance extensive training programs to upgrade staff qualifications and&#13;
capabilities during implementation and establish such programs as part of career development within&#13;
the civil service. Initially, special focus in training will be given for (a) human resource management&#13;
staff of ministries and decentralized institutions, on the HRIS to enable them to take full advantage of&#13;
the system, (b) middle-level office staff, to learn basic office technology, (c) high-level managers, to&#13;
acquire change management techniques, (c) key ministry staff, to be trained in specialized topics and&#13;
become trainers to other staff, and (d) middle-level managers/technicians to receive management&#13;
development and technical training. Activities envisaged under the PPF would include carrying out a&#13;
training needs assessment within the scope of the project, and providing training to human resource&#13;
management staff of ministries to enable them to take full advantage of the HRIS being extended to&#13;
them. Given the overall importance of upgrading the quality of human resources for achieving sus-&#13;
tainability of PSM efforts, the Bank and the IDB would assist the Government to receive substantial&#13;
bilateral and multilateral grants for staff training and instruction (see section B, and Annex E (1 and&#13;
2)). The German Foundation for International Development (DSE) has indicated interest already to&#13;
broaden training assistance for the Government's public sector modernization program, particularly in&#13;
the areas of financial management, public procurement and auditing techniques.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
34. The Human Resources Component Coordinator, assisted by long-term international advisers and&#13;
short-term local consultants, will provide guidance and will monitor the work of the human resource&#13;
management groups in each ministry, and will receive from them feedback on the operational application&#13;
requirements of each sector. The coordinator will work closely with the Institutional Restructuring&#13;
Component Coordinator.&#13;
Financial Resource Management&#13;
(estimated USS 16.9 million, or 34% of total project costs)&#13;
Issues&#13;
35. Financial resources management in the public sector comprises four different systems: (a) budget, (b)&#13;
accounting, (c) treasury, and (d) public debt. These systems are centrally operated but are independent of&#13;
each other. This leads to obstacles in the management of financial resources, which in turn results in a&#13;
disarray and negative impact on social and economic development strategies and policies.&#13;
36. In November 1995, the Government approved a new law (Ley de Administraci6n Financiera&#13;
Integrada, AFI) (see Box VI), establishing the basic norms and procedures for an integrated financial&#13;
4 Refers only to training for staff remaining in the public sector. It is proposed to provide additional funds for safeguards&#13;
to assure that displaced workers would be able to regain their standards of living, such as training and/or development of&#13;
a micro-enterprise credits scheme.&#13;
&#13;

resources management. Under the principle of centralized regulation and decentralized operation, the&#13;
Government plans to establish accounting standards and procedures, as well as implement one single&#13;
integrated financial system to be used throughout the administration. Financial responsibility and&#13;
accountability, including the related data processing functions, will be transferred to the ministries and&#13;
other decentralized agencies. For this purpose, Financial Administration Units following the new&#13;
integrated financial resources management guidelines established by the law, have been created in each&#13;
ministry/agency.&#13;
37. To improve tax administration and strengthen compliance, since 1989 the Government has advanced&#13;
in the implementation of a tax and customs admninistration reform program (see also Box VII for achieved&#13;
progress in tax reform policies), including: (a) enactment of a new law (Ley del Delito Fiscal) prescribing&#13;
stiffer penalties for tax evasion, including imprisonment; (b) creation of a Large Taxpayers' Unit now&#13;
covering the largest 1,000 taxpayers accounting for over 80% of tax obligations; and (c) increase in the&#13;
efficiency of collection, administration, and control of taxes through the restructuring of audit units in the&#13;
internal revenue service, a new integrated tax reporting system, and a vehicle registration system.&#13;
The Governments Reform Program&#13;
38. The Ministry of Finance will function as the "lead" institution, regulating and guiding the whole&#13;
administration and consolidating the information flowing from the Financial Administration Units. The&#13;
integrated financial management system will include the following modules:&#13;
* Budget. Improve both the preparation of the yearly estimates of Government revenues (by source),&#13;
and investments and expenditures (by program) and the comparison of actual revenues/expenditures&#13;
against the budget during the year. In addition, physical targets such as number and types of employ-&#13;
ees per unit (to be compared against the Human Resources Information System, HRIS, database),&#13;
service delivery indicators (number and type of students in the Education programs, number of pa-&#13;
tients served by hospitals in the Health sector, etc.) will also be forecasted and controlled;&#13;
* Procurement of Goods and Services. To keep track of all Government purchases and related&#13;
statistical information;&#13;
* Human Resources Information System (HRIS). To know the number and type of employees working&#13;
in each governmental unit, payroll calculations and associated costs for salaries, benefits, etc. The&#13;
current HRIS would be used as the starting point for this module;&#13;
* Public Debt. To provide information of Government obligations from both external and internal&#13;
sources and their due dates, exchange rates and interest fluctuations, etc.;&#13;
&#149;  Treasury Cashflow. To provide information about the determination of the Government's daily&#13;
position in terms of funds availability, and the allocation of funds to ministries/agencies for the pay-&#13;
ment of their obligations. This entails receiving data from the banking system, the tax/customs sys-&#13;
tems, the public debt module, the SECOBYS, etc.;&#13;
* Government Accounting. Establish essentially the consolidation of all the Government accounting&#13;
transactions; and&#13;
* Auditing tools. To facilitate the supervision of the decentralized operation of ministries/agencies.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Budget: In 1995 and as a transition year, the Ministry of Finance (Ministerio de Hacienda,&#13;
MINHAC) has been working with a new budget system called "Budget by Management Areas",&#13;
which reflects priority areas identified by the present administration (social development, administra-&#13;
tion management, justice and security, economic development, public debt, general Government&#13;
commitments, decentralized institutions). The new budget will be fully implemented in 1996.&#13;
Concerns about the system are that it does not appear to constitute a fundamental budgetary reform:&#13;
resources are still allocated the traditional way (i.e.originating, in general, from previous budget&#13;
allocations and programs), and the budget process does not promote improvements in performance,&#13;
nor does it create performance incentives.&#13;
Although a conceptual design for the integration of sub-systems has been developed, there is still a&#13;
lack of integration of the budget with the accounting and treasury/cash management systems. Finally,&#13;
although there seems to be delegation of authority in budget preparation to individual ministries, pro-&#13;
vided they stay within established quarterly ceilings, an alternative control model at the detailed level&#13;
has not been developed. In the absence of clear policy goals and commitments on output, a single&#13;
delegation of input controls may have negative fiscal and broader policy consequences. In order to&#13;
improve the quality of the budget document and provide elements to meaningfully analyze budgetary&#13;
data, the project will assist in: (i) the revision of the tools developed for budgetary preparation,&#13;
approval, and execution by previous efforts; (ii) improving the techniques for programming budgetary&#13;
execution in coordination with the Treasury area, ensuring operational decentralization without the&#13;
loss of overall financial control; and (iii) providing tools to do substantive budgetary evaluations&#13;
based on real output data.&#13;
* Treasury/Cash Management: Progress has been achieved in this area as well. Treasury currently has&#13;
a single account at the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) to better control revenues and expenses at the&#13;
central level. Payment authorization procedures, as well as revenues receipt procedures, have been&#13;
streamlined, thus increasing efficiency and cutting administrative costs. Nevertheless, some areas need&#13;
to be strengthened and improved. Decentralization of payment and banking systems needs to be&#13;
integrated with the reforms of the budgetary and accounting systems to ensure adequate control&#13;
mechanisms are in place. Similarly, a link between cash management and debt management should be&#13;
established. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure that idle cash in departmental bank accounts is&#13;
effectively eliminated. The project will assist the Government in: (i) the definition of procedures with&#13;
the 'Direcci6n de Presupuesto' in budget execution and resource management; (ii) the design and&#13;
implementation of the expenditure decentralization process; (iii) the establishment of a unified account&#13;
for expenditures from which agency transfers are managed; and (iv) promote efficient information&#13;
exchange with the revenue-generating agencies.&#13;
* Debt Management: An effective and efficient computerized and integrated debt management system&#13;
should be developed. This is a prerequisite for efficient debt management. Furthermore, a link with&#13;
the IFM database and with financial simulation modules should be established. Likewise, because&#13;
ministries (other than MINHAC) account for approximately 20% of public debt, the debt manage-&#13;
ment system must be able to account for alternative sources of financing. Debt raising should be&#13;
centralized at MINHAC. The project will support the Government in: (i) the review of the existing&#13;
database and its development in accordance to IFM requirements; (ii) provide training and technical&#13;
assistance to establish guidelines for accessing capital markets and develop skills in debt negotiation&#13;
and contracting.&#13;

to an institutional strengthening of customs, through (i) revising of normative guidelines, as well as the&#13;
design and adoption of new norms and procedures, and (ii) establishing an informatics system integrated&#13;
in SAFI.&#13;
45. Tax Administration: The Government has been working in this sector for a number of years with&#13;
USAID and IDB support. Progress has been made, resulting in an increase of revenue and tax collection.&#13;
Nevertheless, some areas need improvement or expansion: (i) tax evasion needs to be minimized; (ii)&#13;
geographical coverage of tax administration needs to be widened; (iii) fiscalization procedures and&#13;
methods have to be strengthened through the use of sectoral econometric studies to measure tax evasion,&#13;
which could then be used as guides for fiscalization programs; and through the development and support&#13;
of new techniques and procedures for tax compliance control of informal sector institutions and for those&#13;
performing activities in the capital markets; and (iv) the tax administration direction (DGII) should be&#13;
trained and a plan developed to (a) revise its structure and develop a proposal to establish the Orient and&#13;
Occident Regional Subdivisions; (b) implement the Auditing and Systems Unit and the Programming and&#13;
Tax Evaluation Unit; and (c) develop a proposal to consolidate the organizational structure of the DGII's&#13;
Management Information System Unit.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
46. The Financial Resources Component Coordinator, assisted by long-term international advisers and&#13;
short-term local consultants, will provide guidance and monitor activities of the financial resources&#13;
management reform groups in each ministry.&#13;
Privatization and Private Sector Participation in the Provision of Public Services&#13;
(estimated US$12.1 million; 25% of total project costs)&#13;
Issues&#13;
47. The privatization process, and the introduction of private sector participation (PSP) into the&#13;
provision of public sector services in El Salvador began in 1991 as part of the Government's efforts to&#13;
free markets and promote private sector growth. The 1992-1994 Plan for Economic Development called&#13;
for a restructuring of the public finances, the reduction in nonproductive public spending and the&#13;
elimination of the parastatal sector through the sale of state enterprises and through the transfer of certain&#13;
public services to the private sector. Since the announcement of the Plan, the Government achieved a&#13;
number of successes in an effort to reduce the parastatal sector. Among these, has been the privatization&#13;
of most of the financial sector, inclusive of five commercial banks and four savings and loans agencies. In&#13;
addition, other enterprises have now been privatized such as, the free zone in San Bartolo, the Industrial&#13;
Fishing Complex, the President Hotel, Cemento Maya, INCAFE and several other enterprises, as well as&#13;
assets and land.&#13;
48. In 1993, the Government engaged consultants to assist in reviewing the status of the reforms and to&#13;
recommend a strategy and action plan for the reform of the public sector. An important component of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
this work was the development of a strategy and institutional framework for advancing privatization and&#13;
PSP of the remaining enterprises, including some in key sectors such as the 'Administraci6n Nacional de&#13;
Telecomunicaciones' (ANTEL) and the 'Comisi6n Ejecutiva Hidroelkctrica del Rio Lempa' (CEL), the&#13;
telecommunication and power monopolies, ANDA, the water authority, and most of the transport sector,&#13;
including the Acajutla port and national railroad (see Annex G for background information). Since 1991&#13;
this work was also complemented by efforts to reform the country's obsolete and low-performing public&#13;
pension system. Financed by the IDB, USAID, and supported by the Central Bank, a team with&#13;
representatives from different governmental entities had started with diagnostic work, and outlined first&#13;
proposals for a comprehensive modernization of the system.&#13;
49. The Government incorporated previous work in its 'Plan de Acci6n de Modernizaci6n del Sector&#13;
Publico'. The plan seeks, inter alia, renewed momentum in:&#13;
* privatization and private sector participation in public service provision by staging a centralized and&#13;
coordinated program for divesting most of the remaining enterprises under Government's control; and&#13;
* thoroughly reforming the country's pension system&#13;
The Government's Reform Program&#13;
Privatization/Private Sector Participation in Public Service Provision&#13;
50. During preparation of the PSM-TAL, the Government has taken first steps towards implementing its&#13;
new privatization strategy that shifts the fundamental purpose of the program from relieving budgetary&#13;
pressures to privatization as a policy instrument for sustained growth. Priority has therefore been given to&#13;
key infrastructure sectors. The program seeks to: (i) promote competitive markets for the provision of&#13;
infrastructure services; (ii) minimize the role of regulatory agencies through legislation to facilitate entry&#13;
and access to existing networks; and (iii) enhance capital market development and widen ownership by&#13;
staging transactions through public offerings. A clear indication of the Government's strong committment&#13;
towards improving overall competion in the economy is its recently launched Competitiveness Enhance-&#13;
ment Program supported by the Bank (Ln. 3946-ES, FY96). This aims to reduce impediments to private&#13;
sector investment, improve competition and enhance the efficiency of the country's productive enter-&#13;
prises.&#13;
51. During 1995, the Government established technical working groups for each sector to direct reform&#13;
efforts and prepare enterprises for privatization. The Government also took action to establish a more&#13;
appropriate regulatory and business environment for private sector investment in key infrastructure&#13;
sectors. Late in the year, the program accelerated after the appointment of the Comisionado for the&#13;
Modernization of the Public Sector and other Cabinet changes. New legislation is under preparation for&#13;
the electricity sector which places greater emphasis on creating a competitive environment, and similar&#13;
laws for telecommunications and other infrastructure sectors are also being drafted.&#13;
52. Further specific achievements since December 1995 include: (i) empowerment of the Modernization&#13;
Commission to lead the privatization effort; (ii) recruitment of regulatory specialists to design the legal&#13;
and regulatory frameworks for both the electricity and telecommunications sectors; (iii) executive&#13;
approval for restructuring the state-owned electricity entity into four autonomous enterprises; (iv)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
commencement of the transfer of assets to these enterprises and of the preparatory work for their&#13;
privatization; (v) executive approval of the privatization schedule for the first of the four enterprises to be&#13;
privatized and of the appointment of financial advisors; and (vi) executive approval to begin the&#13;
privatization of the state telephone company, ANTEL, plus the appointment of financial advisers and the&#13;
beginning of preparatory work in the enterprise. Advance funding under a Project Preparation Facility&#13;
PPF has been allocated to support the orderly continuation of these early achievements.&#13;
Reform of the Pension System&#13;
53. Since 1991, a 'Grupo de Reforma' - consisting of ex-MICDES, Central Bank, and Ministry of&#13;
Finance staff that ensured continuity - has been working on the reform under guidance of the INPEP&#13;
president in a very focused manner. During the preparation of the PSM-TAL, steady progress was made&#13;
in the design of the new private social security system, inclusive of the design of the required laws and&#13;
regulatory changes. The drafts are prepared with the support of Chilean consultants which have also&#13;
assisted the Government and the Grupo de Reforma in the overall design of the reform strategy.&#13;
54. The pension reform plan of GOES envisages the transition to a new pension system which is similar&#13;
to the Chilean pension system. Draft legislation has been prepared for a system with the following&#13;
features: The new system will consist of fully funded individual accounts managed by competing private&#13;
pension funds. Participation in the new system will be mandatory for all new labor market entrants and&#13;
optional for workers who are affiliates of the current institutions, the Instituto Salvadoreno de Seguridad&#13;
Social, ISSS (for private sector employees) and the Insitituto Nacional de Pensiones para Empleados del&#13;
Sector Puiblico, INPEP (for public sector employees). In order to rationalize the existing system, it is&#13;
planned to increase retirement ages, unify and gradually increase contribution rates, and adjust the benefit&#13;
formulae. The draft legislation for the pension reform has been presented to the Bank for comments and&#13;
is currently in the process of revision.&#13;
55. Based on these advances, the Government would like continued assistance in both the technical&#13;
aspects of privatization, private sector participation in service delivery, and pension reform as well the&#13;
management aspects of the program. The PPF would assist the Government in revising and further&#13;
finetuning initial proposals, and in implementing first key steps in the areas mentioned.&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL&#13;
56. This component seeks to support the Government in privatizing the remaining enterprises and&#13;
selected public services that are constraining private sector growth and development. The component&#13;
will focus on&#13;
* key sectors and public services including telecommunications, power generation and distribution, port&#13;
activities, customs administration, and water and sewerage;&#13;
* the reform of the pension system, that will provide new options for private sector participation.&#13;
Despite the focus on key sectors, assistance will also be included for privatizing the remaining smaller&#13;
enterprises as well as assets and land in order to reduce substantially Government's holdings of commer-&#13;
cial activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
57. The component will also build on regulatory work that is being initiated by other Bank and IDB&#13;
projects in these key sectors and public services. The Energy Sector Modernization Loan and the&#13;
Competitiveness Enhancement Project will provide assistance in establishing regulatory frameworks and&#13;
regulatory agencies in the telecommunication and energy sectors, while IDB's Multilateral Investment&#13;
Fund will provide assistance for similar work in the telecommunications sector as well as additional&#13;
resources for the power sector. This component will primarily focus on areas which have not been&#13;
adequately covered, such as the water/ sewage, ports, and road maintenace services, but nevertheless&#13;
need an adequate framework for regulation in order to promote competition.&#13;
Privatization and Private Sector Participation in Public Service Provision&#13;
58. This subcomponent will finance technical assistance, consulting and advisory services and equipment&#13;
subdivided in the following categories: (i) strengthening the privatization group for managing and&#13;
coordinating the program; (ii) TA and equipment for the establishment of the regulatory agencies for the&#13;
water/ sewage and transport sectors; (iii) direct transaction assistance to selected public enterprises in&#13;
power and telecommunications as well as technical assistance for increasing public sector participation in&#13;
ports, water/sewage, and road maintenance services; and (iv) other studies for improving private sector&#13;
participation in service delivery.&#13;
&#149; Strengthen the Privatization Group to Coordinate and Manage the Component. While it is the intent&#13;
of Government to delegate a significant number of tasks to private consultants and advisers for the&#13;
implementation of the program, the privatization group within the PCU will still be required to coor-&#13;
dinate many of the activities crossing various entities of the Government apparatus and oversee the&#13;
work of consultants and enterprises involves and report on progress. For these functions the privati-&#13;
zation group is severely understaffed. Accordingly, the component will finance two specialists in&#13;
transactions and regulatory mechanisms.&#13;
*  Strengthen Regulatory Environment in the Transport and Water Sectors. This sub-component will&#13;
complete work that has been already started through the assistance of the other sectoral loans of the&#13;
World Bank and the IDB in establishing a pro-private sector regulatory environment and for establish-&#13;
ing and strengthen regulatory mechanisms and agencies that will be entrusted to oversee activity in&#13;
each sector. Specifically focus of this program will be given to establishing the proper regulatory&#13;
framework for private participation in the water and sewage sector as well as the transport sector. In&#13;
the context of implementing privatization activities, and based on a study of the exiting legal and&#13;
institutional framework for environmental protection, this subcomponent will, furthermore, finance&#13;
environmental studies identifying potential weaknesses and recommending institutional and legal&#13;
corrective measures to ensure environmentally sound privatization policies and actions.&#13;
*  Direct Transaction Assistance to Selected Enterprises andfor Private Sector Participation in Public&#13;
Services. This major subcomponent will finance the services of accountants, lawyers, investment&#13;
bankers and other financial advisors, environmental specialists and other technical and management&#13;
specialists for preparing, marketing and selling the enterprises slated for privatization, including&#13;
ANTEL, CEL distribution and possibly thermal power generation. In addition, the sub-component&#13;
will also finance similar services for preparing and bidding concessions in the water, ports and road&#13;
maintenance sectors. The activities will involve such tasks as due diligence and audits by financial&#13;
accountants, preparations of sales or concession memoranda's, investor search and promotion activi-&#13;
ties, marketing assistance, preparation of legal documents, advisory assistance to the Government in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
deal structure, staging of transaction, negotiations and closing and post-closing activities. For enter-&#13;
prises or services that will be contracted out but not necessarily sold to private investors, this sub-&#13;
component will finance technical specialists for identifying and packaging concessionary contracts and&#13;
for drawing up the legal agreements, for soliciting operators and for making awards.&#13;
Special Studies to Support Privatization Program. While most of the privatization options and&#13;
strategies in each key infrastructure sector will be funded under separate projects, this component will&#13;
include funds for studies and privatization plans for road and highway maintenance and for facilitating&#13;
the issuance of shares of privatized enterprises in the capital markets.&#13;
Reform of Pension System&#13;
59. In order to ensure successful implementation of the proposed pension reformn, the circumstances of&#13;
pension reform in a small country like El Salvador will have to be taken into account, especially since the&#13;
proposed model has so far only been tested in larger countries. In the design of the new system, particular&#13;
consideration must therefore be given to issues such as i) institutional capacity, ii) economies of scale and&#13;
scope in the provision of member services, iii) the availability of adequate instruments for the investment&#13;
of pension funds as well as iv) the risks of concentration and the resulting regulatory and supervisory&#13;
difficulties. The institutional capacity of supervising the private pension funds is crucial. To ensure proper&#13;
functioning of the new system, extensive training is required for the staff that will regulate and supervise&#13;
the new private pension system.&#13;
60. In the organization of member services, the options and advantages of unbundling the services&#13;
provided by the pension fund management companies should be studied in more detail with the objective&#13;
of maximizing competition between fund managers. Further, the legislation for the new scheme should&#13;
allow for pension fund investment abroad as well as for foreign investment in the pension fund manage-&#13;
ment companies&#13;
61. In addition, substantial rationalization and improvement in the efficiency of administration of the&#13;
existing institutions is necessary. The contribution records of members switching over to the new system&#13;
will have to be systematized to calculate the transfer certificates in recognition of members' past&#13;
contributions. Further, it will be necessary to modernize the existing system, since it will continue to&#13;
collect contributions (supplemented by budgetary transfers) and pay out benefits to members who remain&#13;
as affiliates.&#13;
62. To support the Government's pension reform program, this subcomponent would, more specifically,&#13;
finance the following activities:&#13;
*  compilation, verification and registration of individual contribution records in INPEP and ISSS;&#13;
*  design of methodology and operational procedures for calculating and issuing the certificate of&#13;
transfer;&#13;
*  design of an social security identification number integrated into the personal identification system;&#13;
&#149;  financial assessment of the public pension system with the objective of separating the health and&#13;
pension programs of ISSS and the pension and loan programs of INPEP;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
*  elaboration and implementation of financial and organizational plan for the public system during the&#13;
transitional phase;&#13;
*  study of the market for private pension fund management companies with respect to the special&#13;
conditions of pension reform in a small country;&#13;
*  study of options for organizing the collection of contributions;&#13;
*  data processing and office equipment as well as staff training for the agency supervising private&#13;
pension fund management companies;&#13;
*  communication and dissemination of pension reform activities, including study tours for members of&#13;
the Assembly, opinion leaders and managers of the public pension system.&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
63. The component will be implemented by the privatization group within the PCU. The group will be&#13;
staffed by several high caliber professionals in the area of financial transactions, legal, public information&#13;
and legislative and regulatory frameworks. The privatization group will direct and supervise work that&#13;
will be carried out by a number of enterprise teams (consisting of sector ministries, enterprises and the&#13;
staff of the privatization group) for the privatization of the specific enterprises. In addition, the group will&#13;
report to the 'ComiW de Modernizaci6n' and act as its adviser for approving specific strategies and&#13;
transactions.&#13;
64. In the area of Pension Reform, project assistance would be provided through the 'Grupo de&#13;
Reforma' (see para. 54). Given the scope and importance of the reform, the Government has given&#13;
particular attention to consensus building and participation of key stakeholders, as well as to public&#13;
information prior to implementation. This component intends to support such efforts strongly during&#13;
implementation and supervision, and provide ample opportunities for exchanging ('best practice')&#13;
experiences from implementing pension reform in other countries, with focus on similar efforts in Central&#13;
America.&#13;
Environmental Protection during Privatization&#13;
65. In April 1996, a study on the institutional and legal aspects of environmental protection was carried&#13;
out. In the absence of clear-cut environmental policies and responsible institutions, the study recom-&#13;
mended the project to assist the Government in initial key steps towards environmental protection, and,&#13;
incrementally, contribute to respective environmental policy formulation. Furthermore, the study&#13;
recommended more targeted environmental audits of selected entities, particularly in power generation,&#13;
water/sewage and ports sectors.&#13;
66. The project will ensure that privatizations and private sector participation in service delivery financed&#13;
under this component will be carried out in a manner that adequately protects the environment. While&#13;
broader environmental issues are outside the project's scope, this component will make resources&#13;
available in case the Government decides to extend its privatization efforts to environmentally sensitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
sectors. In this case, the project provides funds up to US$500,000 to: (i) define the environmental&#13;
requirements and issue guidelines satisfactory to the Bank for each sector concerned (i.e. in power&#13;
generation, water/sewage, ports); (ii) strengthen the capacities of the environmental units within these&#13;
sectors until such time that one single entity is established and given the full authority to handle the&#13;
monitoring enforcement for the entire country; (iii) carry out environmental audits of the enterprises&#13;
being privatized fully or through concessions as part of their standard work program required to prepare&#13;
them for bid. The findings of such audits would be summarized and disclosed in the information&#13;
prospectus and bidding documents provided to prospective bidders.&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
(estimated US$8.6 million, or 18% of total project costs)&#13;
Proposed Assistance under the PSM-TAL&#13;
67. The PSM-TAL will finance a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) within the Presidential Commission&#13;
for the Modernization of the Public Sector (CPMSP) that is responsible for coordinating the project and&#13;
providing support and orientation to all entities involved in the reform. The project will also support the&#13;
carrying out of Government activities associated with the incremental operating costs of the PSM-TAL.&#13;
The PCU was set up in 1995 during project preparation. It is headed by a National Director -&#13;
'Comisionado Presidencial para la Modernizacion del Sector Pziblico' - and is staffed with a Technical&#13;
Coordinator and six Component/Sub-Component Coordinators in charge of the different areas covered&#13;
under the project. Moreover, the PSM-TAL will support the existing project administrative unit,&#13;
established in 1991 under the Bank's ongoing Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3348-ES), in&#13;
carrying out the procurement of goods and services under the project. This unit will report to the PCU&#13;
for the purposes of the PSM-TAL. The PCU will have a budget to finance long- and short-term&#13;
consultant services, training and office technology equipment (see Figure 1: Organization Chart).&#13;
68. To facilitate overall project coordination and implementation, special emphasis would be given to&#13;
starting with effective public relations policies and launching public information campaigns on PSM. The&#13;
PPF is providing initial financing for the PCU, as well as for selected modernization efforts and the&#13;
launching of the PR campaign. Before effectiveness of the PSM-TAL, IDB would provide ample&#13;
cofinancing for this unit under specific TA under its loan.&#13;
69. The project will also assist the Government to coordinate effectively different sources of funds&#13;
provided by the donor community to carry out PSM efforts in different areas5. Joint seminars and&#13;
workshops would ensure exchange of information and complementarity between different project&#13;
approaches, and contribute to better synergy of project objectives. Coordination with the Bank's ongoing&#13;
modernization efforts in sector ministries (in health, education and agriculture) and with the Competitive-&#13;
5 While one specific area of PSM - decentralization of state institutions - is outside the scope of this project, a local&#13;
coordinator for decentralization (within the PCU) will be financed under the IDB loan to contribute to coherent policy&#13;
making in this area. Such arrangement would help ensure effective communication between PSM activities at central&#13;
government level and efforts towards modernization in municipalities (cf. example in Box IV). Decentralization and&#13;
municipal development policies are currently being assisted by GTZ.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
ness Enhancement Loan would be given particular importance. The same holds for IDB assistance&#13;
projects in related areas.&#13;
Project Costs and Financing&#13;
70. Total base cost of the project is estimated at US$49.2 million equivalent. Overall project costs&#13;
(including contingencies and IDB's inspection and supervision fees) is estimated at US$51.5 million (see&#13;
Box VIII). The IBRD loan will finance US$24.0 million, and the IDB will finance US$19.7 million. Of&#13;
the IDB portion, US$15.9 million will be used to finance the Financial Resource Management Compo-&#13;
nent and US$3.8 million will finance professional staff of the PCU. The Government contribution will be&#13;
US$7.8 million equivalent, primarily to finance counterpart staff, training support costs, office space,&#13;
supplies, secretarial services, and vehicle operation. A PPF (P279-ES) advance of US$1.9 million will be&#13;
refinanced under the loan. Retroactive financing will be allowed for expenditures not exceeding US$2.4&#13;
million (10% of the loan amount) after 1 September, 1996. Given the country's focus in international&#13;
financial transactions, and its positive experiences with floating interest rates for its international loans,&#13;
the Government has chosen a LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan (SCL). The IDB intends, at a&#13;
later stage, to provide an additional quick-disbursing loan (estimated at US$50 million) to assist the&#13;
Government's overall public sector modernization program.&#13;

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Organization and Implementation&#13;
71. The Borrower will be the Republic of El Salvador. Overall project coordination of the PSM-TAL is&#13;
the responsibility of the Presidential Commission for the Modernization of the Public Sector (CPMSP).&#13;
The CPMSP is composed of a minister-ranked President-appointed Presidential Commissioner for the&#13;
Modernization of the Public Sector (the Commissioner) who is the CPMSP coordinator and head of the&#13;
PSMP, and the Ministers of Finance and Economy.6&#13;
72. Success of the project will depend crucially on sustained political backing at the highest level and on&#13;
appropriate organizational mechanisms within government. The political direction of the reform is&#13;
provided by the Commissioner who is, for the purpose of the PSM-TAL, the National Director of the&#13;
Project. Political coordination of reform efforts is achieved through interministerial coordination via the&#13;
CPMSP. Privatization efforts are accompanied and monitored by a politically independent, highly&#13;
respected and experienced 'Comisi6n de Notables." The Comisi6n de Notables, which is made up of&#13;
well-respected citizens from different sectors of society, oversees the privatization processes to ensure&#13;
that they are carried out in a transparent manner within the law.&#13;
73. The technical direction of the PSMP is carried out by the Commissioner with the support of a&#13;
technical coordinating unit. This unit is the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) for the purpose of the PSM-&#13;
TAL. The PCU provides technical leadership and is responsible for project execution in the respective&#13;
areas. The PCU has been building a track record by successfully managing activities under the PPF and&#13;
the TAL (Ln. 3648-ES). It depends directly from the National Director of the Project and is supported by&#13;
a Project Coordinator, seven component coordinators, and staff in charge of procurement and account-&#13;
ing/financial administration. The component coordinators and the administrative staff report to the&#13;
Project Coordinator.&#13;
74. Beneficiary entities are responsible for project implementation, while the PCU maintains the technical&#13;
and administrative coordination functions for all components. In the case of the Human and Financial&#13;
Resource Management Components, the Ministry of Finance as the normative entity in charge for&#13;
implementing the macro-systems of human and financial management, will ensure that activities are&#13;
executed in accordance with the overall plan agreed with the PCU.&#13;
75. Each of the main beneficiary ministries and decentralized institutions have either set up or are setting&#13;
up reform groups responsible for promoting, planning, coordinating and monitoring their agency's efforts&#13;
in institutional restructuring and human resource and financial management. Each reform group is headed&#13;
by a coordinator appointed by the minister or head of institution involved. The agency coordinators&#13;
maintain permanent communication with the component coordinators of the PCU, and report to the&#13;
National Director. To facilitate overall project coordination and implementation, special emphasis would&#13;
6 As part of the Government's institutional restructuring, the ex Ministry of Coordination (MICDES) that had previously&#13;
coordinated PSM efforts was dissolved on December 31, 1995. Now, PSM efforts are being fully coordinated by the&#13;
COM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
be given to starting with effective public relations policies and launching public information campaigns on&#13;
PSM.&#13;
76. In order to ensure coordination with the Reform Groups within individual sector ministries special&#13;
working groups would be established. They would be related to specific PSM issues, and being guided&#13;
and supervised by the PCU.&#13;
77. The project has been designed flexibly in order to respond to changing needs during implementation&#13;
and potential outcomes resulting out of the participatory approach of the project. Due to the nature of a&#13;
public sector modernization project, initial and ongoing participation of the major stakeholders within the&#13;
project design and its main activities was encouraged and will be ensured during project implementation&#13;
through special built-in participatory-mechanisms such as consultation, reform groups, workshops, and&#13;
joint committees. Further, targeted service delivery surveys would allow for selective participation of&#13;
user groups and citizens in PSM efforts and accompany implementation. Such surveys would also sustain&#13;
effective monitoring. Some of these activities will be financed under the PPF. Additional periodic reviews&#13;
would be carried out (initially on a quarterly basis) and disbursements would be synchronized with&#13;
progress achieved.&#13;
Training Plan&#13;
78. Given current levels of qualifications of public servants, the introduction of new management tools as&#13;
well as new human resources and information-systems through PSM will require major training efforts.&#13;
The project would provide training according to groups of staff and education levels. As a condition for&#13;
Board presentation, the Government proposed a training needs assessment that will serve as a basis for a&#13;
detailed plan of training activities under the project. This would allow for assessing the overall funds&#13;
needed, and to seek bilateral and multilateral donor contributions to assist the Government's efforts. A&#13;
preliminary training estimate and a diagnosis of training needs in its original Spanish version appears in&#13;
Annex E (I and 2).&#13;
79. Given the overall importance of upgrading the quality of human resources for achieving sustainability&#13;
of PSM, the Bank and the IDB would assist the Government to receive substantial multilateral and&#13;
bilateral grants for staff training and instruction.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
80. Procurement will consist primarily of consultants' services for training, including transportation and&#13;
per diem, technical assistance, and studies. It would also include computing and communications&#13;
equipment and software, five vehicles, and some office refurbishing and furniture.&#13;
81. All project components to be financed under the proposed Loan would be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement of January 1995. Procurement would be conducted by&#13;
administrative staff of the PCU. This staff has acquired substantial experience in handling national and&#13;
international public procedures during the implementation of the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project (Ln.&#13;
3348-ES) and the TAL (Ln. 3648-ES). In addition, specific technical assistance would be provided under&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
the project to strengthen the PCU to provide additional training to enable staff to handle a substantial&#13;
number of consultants' contracts that would be required in the project. Detailed procurement and&#13;
disbursement procedures to manage procurement and ensure acceptable procedures would be included in&#13;
a comprehensive Project Implementation Plan (PIP) that will be used by all relevant project executing&#13;
entities. The Government has selected a consulting firm satisfactory to the Bank that will, inter alia, help&#13;
prepare the PIP. During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on a first draft of&#13;
the PIP. The PIP will define (i) for each component: objectives, key project activities, outputs, institu-&#13;
tional arrangements, performance indicators and timing targets (Annex A of Technical Annex); (ii) for&#13;
each component: work program, budget, and procurement plans for the first year of implementation; (iii)&#13;
responsibilities of the Government's agencies associated with project implementation; (iv) monitoring and&#13;
evaluation indicators and targets; and (v) an informatics strategy for information and communication&#13;
systems to be applied by the agencies involved in the project. Completition, and adoption by presidential&#13;
resolution (acuerdo ejecutivo), of the Project Implementation Plan was agreed to be a condition for loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
82. Procurement arrangements under the project are summarized in Annex C. Although not foreseen,&#13;
contracts for goods valued at US$250,000 equivalent or more, would be procured through ICB&#13;
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts for systems development, computing&#13;
equipment and software for the Human Resource Information System (HRIS), valued at US$100,000&#13;
equivalent or more per contract, would be procured through ICB two-stage procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Contracts for other goods valued at US$100,000 or more but less than US$250,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, would be purchased through LIB, among suppliers with maintenance and service facilities in El&#13;
Salvador, up to an aggregate of US$1.5 million equivalent. For ICB and LIB procedures, the PCU would&#13;
use the standard bidding documents (SBDs) issued by the Bank, with such modifications as agreed by the&#13;
Bank to be necessary for the purpose of the project. For negotiations, the PCU submitted satisfactory&#13;
drafts of the SBDs and agreed to put them into effect by loan effectiveness. Contracts for goods valued at&#13;
less than US$100,000 but more than or equal to US$50,000 will be procured through international&#13;
shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000. When estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per&#13;
package, goods would be procured under national shopping procedures, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$300,000. Both international and national shopping will require quotations from at least three eligible&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
83. Individual consultants and consultant firms for training, including transportation and per diems,&#13;
technical assistance, including auditing services, and studies, would be contracted following the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency (August 1981). For complex consulting assignments, Bank-issued standard forms of contract&#13;
would be used. For other assignments, standard forms of contract, issued by the Borrower and acceptable&#13;
to the Bank will be employed. Standard letter of invitation (LOI) agreed with Bank would be used&#13;
whenever appropriate.&#13;
84. During appraisal, technical assistance required to support the components and the PCU were&#13;
reviewed and agreed with the CPMSP. During negotiations, the Government presented evidence of&#13;
procurement plans for the first year of activities. Finetuning and further programming will be done within&#13;
the PIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
85. Prior Review by the Bank. Prior review by the Bank would be required for procurement proce-&#13;
dures and documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB and LIB, regardless of its value.&#13;
It is expected that these procurement arrangements would result in about 85 percent of Bank-financed&#13;
contracts by value. All terms of reference for training, technical assistance and studies, all contracting&#13;
documents, including short lists, of technical assistance and studies of critical nature, and single source&#13;
contracting would be subject to prior review. Documentation for contracts with consultant firms, valued&#13;
above US$100,000 and for individual consultants, valued above US$50,000, would also be subject to&#13;
prior review. The thresholds for prior review are justified, based on a careful review of estimated costs&#13;
and nature of consultants services which would be required under the project. All other documentation&#13;
would be subject to ex-post review during auditing and by Bank supervision missions on a random basis.&#13;
86. No recent Country Procurement Assessment on El Salvador is available. However, El Salvador's&#13;
procurement regulations clearly authorize, as a special provision, application of procurement procedures&#13;
of international financial institutions in the procurement of goods and services, where financing of such&#13;
procurement comes from an international financial institution.&#13;
Disbursements and Financing&#13;
87. The proposed loan would be disbursed over a four-year period, with a completion date of February&#13;
28, 2001. The project closing date will be August 31, 2001. Disbursements would be made on the basis&#13;
of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts valued below US$100,000 for goods, below&#13;
US$50,000 for individual consultants, and below US$100,000 for consultant firms. For every contract&#13;
equal to or above these amounts, disbursements would be fully documented. For disbursements made&#13;
through SOEs, detailed documentation providing evidence of expenditures would be retained by the&#13;
PCU, and made available for the required audit and also for supervision by IBRD. A special account in&#13;
U.S. Dollars with an authorized allocation of US$2.1 million would be established in the Central Reserve&#13;
Bank of El Salvador to facilitate Government's execution of the project. The first advance to the special&#13;
account, however, will be limited to US$0.7 million to avoid overfunding or having an inactive account&#13;
during the first few months of the project. The special account would be replenished on a monthly basis.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
88. The project administration unit will maintain records and accounts of all transactions related to the&#13;
PSM-TAL. The PCU would hire independent auditing services satisfactory to IBRD to prepare annual&#13;
audits at the end of each government fiscal year. The audit reports would include separate opinions on the&#13;
use of SOEs and the special account. The PCU would submit the audit reports to IBRD within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;

Annex E (2)&#13;
Diagn6stico Profesiografico del Perfil Actual de los Empleados Puiblicos&#13;
Para la realizaci6n del diagn6stico de la demanda de capacitaci6n requerida para poder&#13;
ejecutar con exito el Programa de Modernizaci6n del Sector Puiblico, se ha estimado&#13;
conveniente hacer primero un estudio de la situaci6n actual de los funcionarios y&#13;
empleados puiblicos, con el fin de pronosticar el grado de aprovechamiento o de dificultad&#13;
que tendran estas personas para asimilar los contenidos planteados en el plan de&#13;
capacitaci6n resultante; en segundo lugar se realizara el levantatniento de necesidades de&#13;
capacitaci6n con representantes de los diferentes componentes del Programa de&#13;
Modernizaci6n.&#13;
Comprendi6 el anAlisis de la situaci6n actual de los Empleados y Funcionarios del Sector&#13;
Publico, para lo cual se han revisado las siguientes variables:&#13;
*  Nivel academico&#13;
*  PirAmide de edades&#13;
*  Tiempo de servicio&#13;
*  Sexo&#13;
Se utiliz6 este metodo ya que en la actualidad no se cuenta con un Sistema de&#13;
Clasificaci6n y Valoraci6n de puestos central para todo el Sector PuIblico, por lo tanto no&#13;
existen perfiles de contrataci6n para los ocupantes de los cargos en el Gobierno, tampoco&#13;
se cuenta con un Sistema de Evaluaci6n del Desempefio estandar para el mismo grupo de&#13;
Empleados que permita evaluar si las deficiencias en el rendimiento son producto de un&#13;
perfil inadecuado de las personas en cada puesto de trabajo, o a otro tipo de problemas,&#13;
como falta de capacitaci6n o ausencia de motivaci6n.&#13;
Para la realizaci6n de este estudio se utiliz6 la base de datos del Sistema de Informaci6n&#13;
de Recursos Humanos SIRH, el cual recopila informaci6n de mas de ciento treinta mil&#13;
empleados del Sector Puiblico (no se encuentran registrados en esta base los miembros de&#13;
la defensa nacional, ni de la Conision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa).&#13;
La informaci6n fue segmentada de la siguiente manera:&#13;
* Nivel Gerencial&#13;
* Nivel Tecnico Administrativo&#13;
* Personal de la Unidades de recursos Humanos&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E (2)&#13;
Presentaci6n y Analisis de Resultados&#13;
1. Nivel gerencial&#13;
1.1 Nivel Academico&#13;
Para este analisis y el de todos los que se haran dentro del nivel Gerencial, se tomaron en&#13;
cuenta todas las personas que ocupan cargos de direcci6n dentro de las Instituciones en&#13;
estudio, desde Directores Simples hasta Jefes de Secci6n, totalizando 1153&#13;
Al realizar la separaci6n por niveles educativos se encuentra que el 6% de los&#13;
Funcionarios han alcanzado unicamente el nivel basico (hasta noveno grado); el 22% ha&#13;
alcanzado el Bachillerato, mientras que un 9%  posee niveles tecnicos;  el 1%  se&#13;
encuentran cursando carreras universitarias; el 61% corresponde a profesionales&#13;
universitarios y menos del 1% han completado estudios de post-grado.&#13;
Dos datos llaman poderosamente la atenci6n: el primero es que al sumar los niveles basico&#13;
y bachillerato (28%) nos encontramos con una cantidad grande de personas que en la&#13;
actualidad ostentan cargos de direcci6n con niveles educativos bajos (307 Funcionarios);&#13;
el segundo es que solo se encontr6 a siete personas con post-grado, lo que, como se&#13;
mencion6 en el pArrafo anterior representa menos del uno por ciento de los funcionarios;&#13;
ambos datos plantean una debilidad educativa para el Estado.&#13;
Dentro de este segmento es alentador encontrar una 'franja ancha" de profesionales&#13;
universitarios (61%) que equivalen a 664 Funcionarios, lo que se convierte en una&#13;
forlaleza educativa para el Estado.&#13;
1.2 Pircmide de edades&#13;
La pirramide de edades para el nivel gerencial se comporta de la siguiente manera: en la&#13;
clase de 20-30 afios se encuentra el 9% de los Funcionarios; de 31-40 anos, el 38%; en la&#13;
clase de 41-50 anios, se encuentra el 35%; arriba de 61 anios se encuentra el 4% de los&#13;
Empleados.&#13;
Para fines estrictamente de capacitaci6n, pueden ser considerados todos los Funcionarios,&#13;
sin importar su edad, particularmente en lo que se relaciona a cambio Actitudinal y en el&#13;
conocimiento del los nuevos sistemas de trabajo; sin embargo, para fines de desarrollo y&#13;
formaci6n de Cartas de Reemplazo, se debe pensar principalmente en las dos primeras&#13;
clases, que van de los 20 a los 40 a-nos, ya que cualquier inversi6n que se realice en este&#13;
segmento, le proporcionara al Estado una plusvalia laboral de 15 a 30 afios de vida iutil,&#13;
principalmente si se piensa en un programa de becas para estudios de Post-grado.&#13;
En relaci6n con las dos clases ultimas, que van de 61 a mas de 70 afios, y que representa el&#13;
4%, se podria pensar en dos tipos de acci6n para e futuro inmediato de estas personas:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E (2)&#13;
*  Seleccionar un banco de candidatos elegibles para formnaci6n de Asesores para las&#13;
distintas Instituciones del Estado, ya que se pueden encontrar personas con un historial&#13;
laboral 'Vico" en experiencias, las cuales pueden ser aprovechadas en diferentes&#13;
situaciones.&#13;
*  Aprovechar los programas que poseen las instituciones de seguridad social en acciones&#13;
preparatorias para el retiro.&#13;
1.3 Tiempo de servicio&#13;
Los resultados de esta clasificaci6n se encuentran de la siguiente manera: de 0 a 5 afios de&#13;
antiguedad, se encuentra el 40%; de 6 a 10 afios, el 19%; de 11 a 15, el 12%, de 16 a&#13;
20%, el 14%; el restante 15% se encuentra oscilando en tiempos de servicio que van de&#13;
los 21 a mas de 41 afios.&#13;
Resulta interesante observar la concentraci6n existente en las tres primeras clases, es decir&#13;
de 0 a 15 anios de tiempo de servicio, las cuales agrupan al 71% de los Empleados; si se&#13;
cruzan estos datos con las edades de los Funcionarios en cuesti6n y su nivel educativo, se&#13;
tendra mayores argumentos para iniciar un plan 'Vida-Carrera" a largo plazo orientado&#13;
hacia el rumbo que el Gobiemo necesite marcar de acuerdo a sus planes estrategicos.&#13;
1. 4 Sexo&#13;
Para esta variable se ha analizado la diferencia que existe entre sexos y por niveles&#13;
educativos, encontrando datos curiosos como el hecho de que al comparar el nivel de&#13;
educaci6n basica, no se encontr6 a ninguna mujer, es decir las 62 personas que ocupan&#13;
cargos de direcci6n son hombres. En ese mismo orden, al relacionar los niveles educativos&#13;
de las mujeres comparadas con ellas mismas, podemos observar que porcentualmente&#13;
hablando se encuentran mejor preparadas que los hombres.&#13;
2. Nivel Thcnico&#13;
2.1 Nivel academico&#13;
Para el analisis de esta variable como para las demas del nivel tecnico, se ha tomado a la&#13;
totalidad de las Personas que han sido clasificados de acuerdo a su ocupaci6n, en&#13;
posiciones de caracter estrictamente tecnicas (arriba de actividades administrativas&#13;
rutinarias y abajo de cargos de direcci6n), ascendiendo a 6655 personas.&#13;
En este apartado encontramos que, en el nivel basico se ubica al 8% de los Empleados; en&#13;
el nivel de Bachillerato, el 37%; nivel Tecnico, el 12%; estudiantes universitarios, el 5%;&#13;
Profesionales Universitarios graduados, el 38% y finalmente se encontraron uinicamente 3&#13;
personas con estudios de Post-grado.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E (2)&#13;
El enfasis en este nivel ocupacional deberia estar orientado a disminuir los niveles basico y&#13;
de Bachillerato y aumentar los niveles de Tecnico y de Profesionales Universitarios, de tal&#13;
manera que tambien pueda ser considerado este personal dentro de los planes de&#13;
desarrollo y formaci6n de Cartas de Reemplazo.&#13;
Por otra parte, este grupo de Empleados es el que ejecuta operativamente los planes de&#13;
trabajo del Estado, por lo tanto mientras mas elevado sea el nivel academico, se esperaria&#13;
una mayor capacidad de ejecuci6n, y una mayor flexibilidad en la introducci6n de procesos&#13;
de modernizaci6n.&#13;
2.2 Piramide de edades&#13;
El comportamiento de las edades en el segmento del Personal Tecnico se encuentra de la&#13;
siguiente manera; en la clase de 20 a 30 ainos, se encuentra el 27%; en la clase de 31 a 40&#13;
anios, el 38%; en la de 41 a 50, el 27% y en el segmento de 51 a mas de 70, encontramos&#13;
el 8% de los Empleados.&#13;
Llama la atenci6n en el analisis de esta variable, la franja ancha que resulta al unir las dos&#13;
primeras clases, ya que arroja un resultado del 65% de los empleados en edades que van&#13;
de los 20 a los 40 anios, por lo que se puede considerar a la mayor cantidad en este&#13;
segmento como una poblaci6n 'joven" y con la posibilidad de una Plusvalia Laboral alta&#13;
para el estado.&#13;
2.3 Tiempo de servicio&#13;
La distribuci6n de datos en esta variable se encuentra de la siguiente manera; en el rango&#13;
de 0 a 5 anios, se encuentra el 49%; en el rango de 6 a 10, se encuentra el 17%; en el rango&#13;
de 11 a 15 afios se ubica el 11%; en el de 16 a 20 anios encontramos al 13%; el restante&#13;
10% agrupa a personas que tienen entre 21 a mas de 41 afios de servicio.&#13;
En esta variable, impresiona el alto porcentaje de Empleados en las dos primera clases, es&#13;
decir, en el rango de 0 a 10 afios se encuentra el 66% de los Empleados considerados en&#13;
este estudio.&#13;
Si el dato anterior es congruente con la piramide de edades, tendriamos una situaci6n ideal&#13;
para un programa de desarrollo a largo plazo; de no ser asi, se tendria que revisar las&#13;
politicas actuales de selecci6n y contrataci6n de los Empleados del Sector Puiblico, de tal&#13;
manera que a la hora de la escogitaci6n de nuevos Servidores del Estado, se prevea el&#13;
tiempo de vida uitil (laboralmente hablando) de estas personas.&#13;
2.4 Sexo&#13;
Para esta variable se ha analizado la diferencia que existe entre sexos y por niveles&#13;
educativos, encontrando una tendencia similar a la del nivel Gerencial, pero con el dato&#13;
curioso de que al comparar las Personas graduadas universitarias, existe una mayor&#13;
cantidad de mujeres que de hombres.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E (2)&#13;
3. Unidades de Recursos Humanos&#13;
Al efectuar un analisis de la posici6n que actualmente ocupan las unidades de de Recursos&#13;
Humanos en la Instituciones incluidas en el presente estudio, se puede observar que menos&#13;
del 30% de dichas unidades se encuentran en niveles de Direcci6n, ni reportando a la&#13;
maxima autoridad de la Instituci6n, es decir la mayor cantidad de unidades se encuentran&#13;
subordinadas a divisiones administrativas, en el mejor de los casos con niveles&#13;
organizativos de departamentos y en peor a nivel de secciones.&#13;
Los niveles educativos del Personal que integra las unidades de recursos humanos, se&#13;
podria decir que es adecuado al rol que en la actualidad se les ha asignado en la mayoria&#13;
de las Instituciones: 'idministradores de expedientes y tramitadores de acuerdos"&#13;
De acuerdo a este tipo de actividad, definitivamente las unidades de recursos humanos no&#13;
podran tener un papel protag6nico en la investigaci6n y modificaci6n de la cultura&#13;
organizacional, en el desarrollo de los cuadros gerencialaes, tecnicos y administrativo, ni&#13;
mucho menos, en la planeaci6n estrategica de los recursos humanos.&#13;
Por otra parte, pensar en una nivelaci6n de la jerarquia de las unidades, implica la&#13;
escogitaci6n de las Personas adecuadas a un nuevo perfil del Gerente de Recursos&#13;
Humanos, que responda al avance cientifico y tecnol6gico en esta rama del saver&#13;
adminsitrativo, y por otra parte a un entrenamiento intensivo para el personal tecnico y&#13;
administrativo que conforme las unidades, de cara a las nuevas exigencias de los usuarios&#13;
de los servicios publicos.&#13;
Finalmente, al analizar las plazas que actualmente conforman las unidadaes de recursos&#13;
humanos, se observa que en algunas Instituciones, existen personas asignadas, cuyas&#13;
actividades no tienen ninguna relaci6n con el rol principal de la Administraci6n de&#13;
Recursos Humanos.&#13;

Annex G&#13;
Modernization of Infrastructure'&#13;
Overview&#13;
1.     Mounting problem.  El Salvador entered the 1990s with under-developed and under-&#13;
maintained infrastructure, poorly adapted to the demands of a dynamic, export-led market&#13;
economy.   Telecommunications, power, transport, water and waste services deteriorated&#13;
during the civil war. Security expenditures crowded out spending on basic maintenance and&#13;
investment, and acts of war heavily damaged the power and transport networks. The wartime&#13;
economy was also marked by strong state intervention in the pricing and delivery of services.&#13;
Energy, telecommunications and water were merged into vertically-integrated, state-owned&#13;
monopolies. Regulatory and executive functions were not clearly separated, and worse, the&#13;
companies performed both but were not responsible for either.  Rate-setting, investment&#13;
decisions, procurement, financial oversight, and other key responsibilities were diffused across&#13;
many institutions. Large numbers of surplus employees were hired. Competition in service&#13;
provision was minimal, with little private participation. Prices were not adjusted for two&#13;
decades, and then only for inflation or devaluation.  With the exception of the lucrative&#13;
telecommunications monopoly, the utility companies became dependent on ever larger&#13;
government bail-outs. By the war's end, the Government was saddled with a daunting backlog&#13;
of maintenance and investment, which translated into large unmet demand and frequent&#13;
interruptions of service (Table 111. 1).&#13;
2.     The view from  the private sector.   Deficiencies in the quality and quantity  of&#13;
infrastructure continue to hamper private sector growth, according to the survey, particularly&#13;
the relative severity of telecommunications, highway and power problems. Not only did they&#13;
top the list of infrastructure-related concerns for the sample as a whole, but they were the&#13;
uppermost infrastructure concerns of important groups of firms: industrial and commerce,&#13;
large and medium-sized, export-oriented and non-exporting, and those in San Salvador where&#13;
one quarter of the country's population resides. Exporting firms are bothered most by the&#13;
poor condition of the highways. Moreover, developers of Free Trade Zones reported serious&#13;
delays in obtaining sites, telephone, power and water services.&#13;

Annex G&#13;
Infrastructure Provision: Approaches And Lessons Of Experience&#13;
3.    The Government recognizes that poor performance of state-owned enterprises is largely&#13;
responsible for infrastructure bottlenecks, lagging investment and unmet demand, and the lack&#13;
of access of the poor; that technological change and advances in applied economics have&#13;
stripped some infrastructure monopolies of their "naturalness," lowering barriers to entry and&#13;
subjecting sectors to competition, if not in the market, then for the market; and that good&#13;
economic regulation of natural monopolies can promote economic welfare and afford investors&#13;
and consumers sufficient protection against potential abuses. The Government also recognizes&#13;
practical constraints. The scale of investment required to satisfy pent-up demand, let alone&#13;
support an export-led growth strategy, is far beyond its financial capacity. Significant private&#13;
investment, foreign and domestic, will have to be mobilized to close the infrastructure gap.&#13;
The success of the export-led growth strategy will hinge partly on closing this gap. Surveys of&#13;
multinationals often cite infrastructure quality as one of the most critical factors in influencing&#13;
decisions on the location of investments in manufacturing and high-technology sectors.&#13;
4.    As the Government reassesses its role in each infrastructure sector, it is useful to frame&#13;
the analysis with four broad considerations:&#13;
whether a service is publicly or privately owned and managed, it should be run on a&#13;
commercial basis with prices covering costs, and any subsidies, provided directly and&#13;
transparently;&#13;
* creating a market structure that maximizes opportunities for competition is critical;&#13;
* as non-competitive elements are unbundled from competitive or potentially-competitive&#13;
ones, as a rule, the former will require continuing oversight or regulation to protect&#13;
investors and consumers from abuses. While the form of regulation will depend on a&#13;
country's institutional endowment, it should ideally be organized at arm's length from the&#13;
Government, and operate under rules that are clear, expeditious, credible, and stable; and&#13;
* a growing body of research and recent Latin American experience suggest that private&#13;
ownership and management are most effective in locking in gains from commercialization&#13;
and competition.&#13;
Seizing Opportunities: General Recommendations&#13;
5.    The legacy of the 1980s has been highly negative for infrastructure. The Government&#13;
must overcome the huge backlog of maintenance and investment in order to improve the&#13;
quantity and quality of infrastructure while, at the same time, transforming the role of the state&#13;
and inviting the private sector to become a new partner in these activities. This change in the&#13;
relationship between the state and the private sector is, indeed, the only way to address the&#13;
needs for increased management skills and finance. The foundation for this transformation has&#13;
been established and some steps, e.g., in power, have been taken. The agenda of policy and&#13;
institutional change in each infrastructure sector involves:&#13;
revising the basic legal framework of governance, to separate the policy-making and&#13;
regulatory functions of government (national, subnational, or municipal) from the&#13;
operational functions, and clearly define responsibilities for all public and private entities&#13;
involved in the sector;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
*  reforming market structures within sectors (breaking down the vertically integrated&#13;
entities), to unbundle truly natural monopoly components from competitive or potentially&#13;
competitive activities-thereby permitting competition both in and for market segments;&#13;
* articulating in detail the new government role in regulation, which involves: (i) for&#13;
natural monopolies defining regulatory policies to protect investors and the public interest,&#13;
stipulated in statutes or contracts between public and private entities; and (ii) creating&#13;
institutional mechanisms and implementation capacity to carry out this regulatory function.&#13;
A key will be to ensure a politically independent approach for tariff policy based on sound&#13;
economic and financial criteria;&#13;
*  specifying the financial role of government: (i) the subsidy policy, if any, that is justified&#13;
to compensate operators for non-remunerative but essential services; any subsidies&#13;
transferred directly to target groups need to be identified and financed; (ii) in activities&#13;
where the State will retain a significant role, (e.g., non-toll roads) a secure institutional&#13;
framework is needed to ensure financing of maintenance and accountability to users (e.g.,&#13;
a road board funded by road user charges);&#13;
*  promoting private sector participation in the reformed system, which may require&#13;
proactive support for at least a transitional period. At a minimum, there is a need to create&#13;
a transparent, streamlined process of contract design, competitive bidding, and&#13;
screening/approval of transactions; ensuring that new entrants compete fairly with&#13;
incumbent operators; and removing constraints to competition, such as limited access to&#13;
market information.&#13;
D  in those activities which remain, transitionally or for the longer term, under public&#13;
ownership and operation - such as (in most countries) the transmission of power and the&#13;
main road network - restructuring of the responsible entity is needed to create incentives&#13;
for efficient, commercial operation and to permit even limited private sector involvement,&#13;
such as through contracting-out services or management. This restructuring may require&#13;
corporatization, downsizing, decentralization, and improvement of financial and&#13;
management information systems.&#13;
6.    These six broad categories of policy and institutional reforms are not a chronological&#13;
sequence, although most countries begin with the first and the last; each step is mutually&#13;
reinforcing and needs to progress in concert.  However, the full agenda is enormously&#13;
demanding to countries with limited institutional capacity and each country has to find its own&#13;
pace and sequence.   Moreover, there is a range of choices regarding strategies and&#13;
organizations to meet reform objectives. International experience suggests two clear lessons,&#13;
with special significance for countries with limited institutional capacity such as El Salvador:&#13;
(i) choices which allow greater scope for competition provide stronger incentives for good&#13;
performance, while reducing regulatory requirements; and (ii) allowing extensive private&#13;
participation (in management, financing, and ownership) - in ways that permit it to absorb&#13;
risks as well as the rewards of good performance - improve the prospects for successful&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
Telecommunications&#13;
7.    Structure.   Since 1963, the state-owned company, Administraci6n Nacional de&#13;
Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL), has been the sole provider of basic telephone service, with the&#13;
power to license or grant concessions for value-added services. In recent years, ANTEL has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
allowed private operators to offer value-added services, although competition remains weak.&#13;
A cellular operator was granted a five-year concession and by 1994 had 1,500 subscribers. Its&#13;
charges are high by international standards: firms paid US$1,000 for a connection and 35 cents&#13;
a minute in 1993, compared, for example, with only US$100 and 16 cents a minute in Sri&#13;
Lanka, where there are four licensed operators. Data transmission facilities have been leased&#13;
to a private operator, with three to four more leases to be negotiated soon. A paging service&#13;
has also been licensed.&#13;
8.    Performnance. El Salvador's telecommunications sector has been among the weakest in&#13;
Latin America. In 1989 there were just 2.9 lines per 100 inhabitants, which compared&#13;
favorably only with the poorer neighboring countries of Nicaragua (1.2), Honduras (1.9) and&#13;
Guatemala (2.2). Network expansion, though, lagged even these neighbors. In 1981-91, the&#13;
network grew 5.9 percent annually compared with 11.4 percent in Honduras and 7.5 percent&#13;
in Guatemala. As a result, El Salvador had by 1992 the longest waiting list for telephone lines&#13;
in Central America. Many of the sector's weaknesses are due to the inefficiency of ANTEL.&#13;
In 1989, it operated with fewer lines per employee (22) than all Central American carriers,&#13;
except Nicaragua (16). Unrelated activities have yet to be contracted out or sold off, including&#13;
a hospital, and furniture and construction companies. About 10 percent of ANTEL's 7,052&#13;
employees in 1992 were employed in health and security, and over 17 percent were working in&#13;
non-economic rural offices, some of which generate only 20 colones (US$2.3) a month in&#13;
revenue.&#13;
9.    Like many monopoly carriers, ANTEL generates large revenues for the general budget.&#13;
It posted earnings of 500 million colones (US$57.8 million) in 1993. But 87 percent of its&#13;
revenues come from expensive international calls, which in 1991 were 22 to 34 percent more&#13;
expensive than in other countries in the region. Were the company subjected to greater&#13;
competition, its sterling financial record would tarnish quickly. Basic telephone rates were not&#13;
increased for 20 years, and adjustments are made ad hoc to meet cash needs and political&#13;
objectives.  The under-investment that has plagued the sector owes much to recurring&#13;
government interference. On the strength of its profits the company could have borrowed on&#13;
capital markets, but it was not permitted to do so. Since 1989, the company has managed with&#13;
donor support, to upgrade and expand the network. The number of lines doubled to 302,492,&#13;
or 5.5 lines per 100 inhabitants. About two-thirds of the lines are now digital, and San&#13;
Salvador has a fiber optic network. But demand for services is racing ahead of supply: the&#13;
waiting list for lines increased from 162,000 in 1992 to 200,000. ANTEL estimates that by&#13;
the year 2000 the number of lines would have to rise by 90 percent to catch up on the backlog&#13;
of orders and accommodate private sector needs.&#13;
10.   Reform. Besides stepping up investment, ANTEL's management and the Government&#13;
have introduced measures since 1989 to increase efficiency. One-time improvements in&#13;
productivity were achieved partly by cutting staff by about 14 percent over the past three&#13;
years. Repair response time similarly improved: 90 percent of down lines are now repaired&#13;
within four days.  In addition, ANTEL recently developed a restructuring plan that would&#13;
divest many non-core activities and public works contracts are increasingly bid out to the&#13;
private sector. The implementation of turn-key projects by the private sector has helped&#13;
reduce the project cycle. Time needed for feasibility studies has fallen from 36 to 18 months,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
and construction from 24 to 18 months. Finally, with IDB support, a review of the legal and&#13;
institutional framework was completed in February 1994, and with World Bank technical&#13;
assistance, an action plan was completed in July 1994 for the reform of key public enterprises&#13;
including ANTEL.&#13;
11.   Deepening reform. Modernizing the communications system is critical to the country's&#13;
export-led growth strategy.  It will require large investments in expansion of the basic&#13;
network; sufficient supply of high-quality fax, data transfer, packet switching, cellular, and&#13;
other services essential to modern commerce; competition in service delivery to keep prices&#13;
down; and a regulatory function - clearly separated from telecommunications operations - with&#13;
responsibility for protecting investors and consumers. These investment requirements can only&#13;
be met by attracting significant private participation which will require that a clear and credible&#13;
regulatory regime for entry and prices be established.&#13;
Power&#13;
12.   Structure. All planning, regulatory and executive functions are vested in the Comisi6n&#13;
Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (CEL), a state monopoly. Almost all electric power for public&#13;
services is generated by CEL (there is a very small amount of self generation), which sells the&#13;
bulk of its electricity to distribution companies and the remainder to large end-users. In the&#13;
past, the distribution of electricity (except for rural areas) was in the hands of the private&#13;
sector through concessions. These expired in 1986, however, and since then four of the seven&#13;
distribution companies have been under the administration of CEL.  The Electric Power&#13;
Company of El Salvador, formerly one of the private distributors but now controlled by CEL,&#13;
distributes electricity in the capital area.&#13;
13.   Performance. The degree of electrification in El Salvador is low compared to that of&#13;
other Latin American countries, although access to electricity has increased from 33 percent in&#13;
1980 to 61 percent in 1993. Power interruption and voltage irregularities were among the&#13;
most severe constraints cited in the survey. Although outages have subsided in the past two&#13;
years, one-third of the survey firms had their own generating capacity, most likely in response&#13;
to the uncertain power supply. Among large enterprises, 55 percent had their own capacity.&#13;
During the 1980s CEL entered into a period of prolonged decline. During the civil war there&#13;
were over 2,000 attacks on substations and 3,800 on the transmission system costing CEL&#13;
about US$200 million. Moreover, during the last decade there was significant government&#13;
intervention in setting tariffs. Rates were not based on economic criteria, and CEL was not&#13;
allowed to make automatic adjustments for inflation, devaluation or other cost increases. By&#13;
the end of the decade the average tariff was 33 percent of long run marginal cost (LRMC). In&#13;
the early 1990s a prolonged drought required CEL to purchase energy from Guatemala and to&#13;
increase fuel purchases to substitute for hydro power.  These events strained the already&#13;
weakened capacity of CEL, and as a consequence power interruptions and voltage fluctuations&#13;
became frequent. Although, the situation is improving, the capacity of CEL to meet demand&#13;
is inadequate. Demand grew by about 10 percent p.a. during 1991-93 immediately following&#13;
the peace accord, and is expected to grow at 9 percent p. a. through the end of the decade. The&#13;
power sector now faces an enormous backlog of investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
14.   Reform.  The power sector has been a high Government priority and significant&#13;
progress has been achieved. In May 1991 the Government adopted an Energy Sector Policy&#13;
consistent with an open, market-based economy. It set four objectives: (i) an appropriate legal&#13;
and institutional framework; (ii) adoption of pricing policies based on economic costs; (iii)&#13;
significant private sector participation; and (iv) establishment of an institutional and policy&#13;
framework to address environmental issues. A package of energy legislation establishing&#13;
planning and regulatory agencies, a framework for power tariffs and a corporatized CEL has&#13;
been submitted to the Assembly. The first independent power generation project (80 MW)&#13;
was announced in October 1993. The Government has also decided to re-privatize power&#13;
distribution.  CEL's efficiency has been high in spite of the events of the last decade.&#13;
Compared to other Central American countries, CEL has the highest number of customers per&#13;
employee and ranks second in energy sales per employee. A tariff increase of 32 percent was&#13;
applied in late 1992, and the Government has further committed to reach 85 percent of LRMC&#13;
by 1996 and 100 percent by 1999.&#13;
15.   Deepening reform.   The critical next step is to establish a track record of&#13;
implementation of the necessary policy and institutional reforms. Significant additional tariff&#13;
increases are required to reach the 85 percent of LRMC goal in 1996. New concessions need&#13;
to be granted for private power distributors.  Additional independent power projects are&#13;
planned for 1995 (80 MW) and 1997 (50 MW). Implicit in the new structure of the sector is a&#13;
re-shaped role for CEL, partitioned between generation and transmission, with each organized&#13;
as an independent commercial enterprise.  In the future CEL-Generation would generate&#13;
power, buy it from independent power producers through power purchase arrangements, or&#13;
compete directly with them to supply energy to large consumers or distribution companies.&#13;
CEL-Transmission would retain its central role in power transmission but would be established&#13;
as an independent company and guarantee open access to generators. CEL's current activities&#13;
in urban power distribution would effectively cease with the sale of its current franchises to&#13;
private operators.&#13;
Roads&#13;
16.   Structure.  The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for the transport&#13;
sector.  The Vice Ministry of Public Works is responsible for highway maintenance,&#13;
rehabilitation and construction, through the Direcci6n General de Caminos (national roads) and&#13;
Direcci6n de Urbanismo y Arquitectura (urban roads). Municipalities have responsibility for&#13;
portions of the urban road network.&#13;
17.   Performance. El Salvador has approximately 12,400 kms of roads: (i) 1,936 kms&#13;
paved with 38 percent in bad condition, 30 percent in fair condition, and 32 percent in good&#13;
conditions; (ii) 7,890 kms unpaved with 57 percent in bad condition, 31 percent in fair&#13;
condition, 12 percent in good condition (iii) 112 kms in San Salvador (fair to good condition);&#13;
and (iv) other municipalities, 2,474 kms in generally bad condition. The primary road&#13;
network consists of two East-West axes, the Panamerican Highway and the Coastal Highway,&#13;
and four North-South axes. Supply of roads and highways is sufficient, except for rural&#13;
penetration roads in the ex-conflict areas. However, deficiencies in the transport sector were&#13;
the most severe infrastructure constraint noted in the survey. Maintenance suffers from under-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
execution and inefficiencies and salaries and benefits comprise about 80 percent of the road&#13;
maintenance budget.&#13;
18.   Reformn. A Vice Ministry of Transport has recently been established to direct and&#13;
coordinate policy. It will assume functions that were previously handled by other ministries&#13;
(transport regulation, user fees and tolls), eventually becoming the transport regulatory&#13;
authority. In parallel a number of regulatory actions have been taken (establishing weight&#13;
limits and facilitating border crossings), and a number of institutional changes in MOP have&#13;
been initiated. Staff levels in the MOP have been reduced significantly, particularly in the&#13;
Direcci6n General de Caminos.&#13;
19.   Deepening reform.  Improving the quality of existing roads through increased&#13;
maintenance, rehabilitation and modernization is the principal challenge. MOP has prepared a&#13;
five year rehabilitation and maintenance plan but it must secure budget allocations for road&#13;
maintenance over the long term.  Funds are assigned to MOP as part of the central&#13;
government's budget process, based on last year's level of expenditures with no analysis or&#13;
evaluation of programs. Moreover, there is a bias toward external funds which, however, are&#13;
for discrete programs with defined time frames. Ideally they can supplement but not substitute&#13;
for long term road maintenance funds.&#13;
Ports and Rail&#13;
20.   Structure. The Comisi6n Ejecutiva Portuaria Aut6noma (CEPA) has responsibility for&#13;
the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco, the state owned railroad and the airport. CEPA was created&#13;
in 1952 to manage Acajutla, and added responsibilities during the 1970s. Planning, regulatory&#13;
and executive functions are vested in CEPA, although with significant intervention from line&#13;
ministries.&#13;
21.   Performance.  Acajutla is an open access port on the Pacific Coast about 85 kms&#13;
southwest of San Salvador. It has capacity for about 1,500 million metric tons, and is close to&#13;
reaching that level, with total traffic of about 1,300 million metric tons in 1993. Cutuco, also&#13;
on the Pacific coast about 185 kms from San Salvador, handled 50,00 tons in 1991, one-fifth&#13;
of its 1978 traffic level. The railroad is severely deteriorated with 50 percent of its sleepers&#13;
damaged. Rolling stock is in a similarly deteriorated state. CEPA estimates that only 2&#13;
percent of the nation's cargo traffic moves by rail. The airport dates from 1978, has a small&#13;
role in exporting (about 1 percent of all exports), but is increasingly important in non-&#13;
traditional exports. CEPA is relatively stable financially. It earns a modest profit due to&#13;
airport operations, while the railroad loses money and the ports break even. Acajutla suffers&#13;
from labor and operational problems, which leads to a lack of competitiveness with some other&#13;
Central American ports. Labor concessions in the 1980s have led to a salary structure and&#13;
work rules that are increasingly constraining CEPA's competitiveness. The most important&#13;
competition is from Puerto Queztal in Guatemala. Additionally the lack of maintenance and&#13;
investment during the 1980s created a backlog at Acajutla that is slowly being addressed by&#13;
CEPA. Cutuco has limited installations, is only accessible by railroad, and must compete with&#13;
the nearby privately owned port of Punta Gorda.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
22.   Reform. The Government has initiated a number of changes and is actively exploring&#13;
privatization options, including granting operating concessions, divesting storage facilities and&#13;
contracting out maintenance.  CEPA  has improved its financial situation through tariff&#13;
increases and has taken steps to reduce personnel at Acajutla by about half (650 out of 1,400&#13;
workers).&#13;
23.   Deepening reform. Although CEPA has achieved financial stability and is improving&#13;
efficiency, it faces a number of strategic issues. It must recover traffic lost during the civil&#13;
war and compete, in price and services, with Central American ports. This will require greater&#13;
private sector participation, and the transformation of CEPA into a regulatory authority.&#13;
Water and Sanitation&#13;
24.   Structure. The Administraci6n Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (ANDA) is&#13;
the principal water and sanitation institution, but responsibilities are spread across many&#13;
institutions. Water/sanitation production and distribution is split between ANDA for most&#13;
urban systems, some municipalities, and the Ministry of Health for rural systems. The Social&#13;
Investment Fund (FIS) also participates in the construction of rural systems.&#13;
25.   Performnance. All water produced in El Salvador is sub-surface. For the most part&#13;
rivers and lakes are too contaminated for use. Water coverage was 55 percent in 1992, of&#13;
which 78 percent was urban and 16 percent rural. Sanitation coverage was 69 percent, of&#13;
which 87 percent was urban and 52 percent latrines. There are ten waste water treatment&#13;
plants but these handle only 3 percent of production. Demand is projected to grow at 4&#13;
percent p.a. through the end of the decade.  To reach 100 percent coverage in the&#13;
municipalities covered by ANDA, investments on the order of US$150 million p.a. would be&#13;
needed over the next five years. Losses are estimated at 40 percent and service is intermittent.&#13;
In San Salvador it was estimated in 1993 that users received water about 16-18 hours per day.&#13;
Of the 350,000 connections, about two-thirds have working meters.  ANDA's financial&#13;
problems are largely the result of the tariff structure, as well as weaknesses in its billing and&#13;
collection systems.&#13;
26.   Reforn. Some initial steps have been taken toward sectoral reform. A draft diagnostic&#13;
study of the water/sanitation sector has been prepared and new draft legislation is currently&#13;
under review. In the last five years ANDA has been able to improve its financial situation.&#13;
Operating losses have been reduced by about two-thirds, and the overall deficit by about one-&#13;
third. Tariff increases in 1990 and 1992 contributed to the improved financial performance.&#13;
27.   Deepening reform.  The Government must implement tariff reform, and address&#13;
simultaneously the rehabilitation and expansion of production and distribution systems.&#13;
Establishment of planning and regulatory agencies is essential. The Government lacks a water&#13;
resources strategy and policies for conservation and usage. Too little attention is given to&#13;
environmental issues, especially in view of the decline in aquifers and the low coverage of&#13;
waste water.  The institutional framework is disjointed, and there is a multiplicity of&#13;
institutions operating in an uncoordinated and ineffective fashion.&#13;
