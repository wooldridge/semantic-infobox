commitments and disbursements and any other adjustments that may be necessary; and&#13;
(d)    consider the Annual Programmes (APs) prepared by the Bank for enhanced supervision,&#13;
including missions plans, additional independent technical studies or consultancies that may&#13;
be required to clarify issues among donors or better advise on Project implementation&#13;
options.&#13;
2. The MDTF Administrator and partners may request TFMC meetings but the Committee will meet no&#13;
less than semi-annually to:&#13;
(a)    review AWPBs submitted no later than April 30 each year by the MoAFS to the World Bank&#13;
for no objection. The TFMC will review and provide recommendations on AWPBs which&#13;
will be submitted by the ASWAp secretariat and appraised by the Bank during the&#13;
implementation of the MDTF. The submission and approval process will follow existing&#13;
procedures specified in more detail in the Project Implementation Manual. TF contributors&#13;
will be invited to comment and provide recommendations on the overall AWPB or on part of&#13;
it according to their topics of interest. The TFMC retains the right to withhold approval of&#13;
components of the AWPB;&#13;
(b)    review APs shared no later than April 30 each year by the World Bank. TF contributors will&#13;
be invited to comment and provide recommendations on the AP; and&#13;
(c)    monitor implementation progress with the objective of ensuring smooth implementation of&#13;
the funded sub-projects and the overall effectiveness of the program. The WB will organize&#13;
at least once a year an implementation support mission where TF contributors will be invited&#13;
to participate and/or contribute according to their topics of interest. Field trips will be&#13;
organized on regular and ad hoc basis. TF contributors will be invited to contribute to&#13;
discussion on technical issues based on their respective topics of interest.&#13;
3. Decisions will be by consensus of all members present at a decision meeting. Documents may be&#13;
circulated electronically for decisions, failure to respond within a reasonable review period will&#13;
signify consent. Final decision and no objection related to MDTF activities and funding will rest&#13;
with the Bank as the TF administrator.&#13;
