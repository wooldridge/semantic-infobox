I. URBAN TRANSPORT IN THE BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN REGION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1          This project has its origins in two major developments at the Federal and State level:&#13;
(a) the decision of the Government of Brazil (GOB) to decentralize and transfer several subdivisions of&#13;
the Brazilian Urban Train Company (Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos, CBTU) from the Federal&#13;
to the State/Municipal Governments as mandated by the 1 988 Constitution; (b) the willingness of the&#13;
State of Minas Gerais (SMG) and the Municipality of Belo Horizonte (MBH) to takeover the Belo&#13;
Horizonte subdivision of the CBTU (STU-BH) and better integrate it with the privately-owned bus&#13;
transport system. GOB started by decentralizing the two largest CBTU subdivisions (S3o Paulo and Rio&#13;
de Janeiro) and once that was successfully accomplished, it decided to proceed with the&#13;
decentralization of the Belo Horizonte and Recife subdivisions.&#13;
1.2          As in the case of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the GOB requested assistance from the&#13;
Bank to help in completing the STU-BH network and effectively integrating it with the other modes.&#13;
The SMG and MBH agreed to takeover the system as long as the GOB would extend the system to&#13;
Vilarinho and Sao Paulo stations (see map) and build the accesses to facilitate integration at the&#13;
system's main stations. The identification mission took place in early 1 994, and based on its findings,&#13;
the Bank agreed to proceed with the evaluation of the project provided the SMG and MBH would&#13;
incorporate in its urban transport strategy the following two elements: (a) an effective coordination&#13;
between the state and municipal governments of the BHMR; and (b) a formal financing mechanisms&#13;
considered crucial to create an enabling environment for the long-term financial sustainability of the&#13;
Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region's urban transport systems. SMG and MBH moved swiftly and&#13;
diligently to include these elements in its strategy.&#13;
B. Urban Transport in the BHMR: An Overview&#13;
1.3          Background: The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region (BHMR), with 5,850 sq. km, has&#13;
3.5 million inhabitants spread unevenly over 18 municipalities which are dominated by the Municipality&#13;
of Belo Horizonte with 2.1 million inhabitants. Annual population growth of the BHMR and MBH&#13;
averaged 2.6 percent and 1.3 percent respectively in the last five years. The BHMR generates roughly&#13;
51 percent of the GDP of the State of Minas Gerais and is considered the third most important&#13;
economic region of the country. Each day, 3.2 million person trips take place in the BHMR of which&#13;
68.0 percent are by bus (all privately operated), 25.0 percent by private automobile, 1 .7 percent by&#13;
rail (CBTU's Belo Horizonte subdivision popularly known as DEMETRO) and the remaining 5.3 percent&#13;
by other modes (mainly bicycle and walking).&#13;
1.4          The road network is radial and all its main corridors intersect the beltway around the&#13;
BHMR. Bus routes penetrate to the BH neighborhoods and adjoining municipalities through ten main&#13;
corridors of which the most heavily travelled are Amazonas Avenue (9 km), Ant6nio Carlos Avenue&#13;
(7.2 km), and Cristiano Machado Avenue (12.5 km). Only the latter has a reserved bus lane. The&#13;
commercial speed of the buses in the segregated busways is around 25 km/hr but drops to 9 km/hr&#13;
in the central business district. At peak period, most highway corridors are clogged with bumper to&#13;
bumper buses. Bus services are generally of low speed, unreliable and infrequent at peak hours due&#13;
to the congestion. Although they are privately operated, the municipal bus routes are allocated on the&#13;
basis of competitive bidding and regulated by the Empresa de Transporte e Transito de Belo Horizonte&#13;
(BHTRANS), a municipal agency; the intermunicipal bus services, also privately operated, are managed&#13;
by the Minas Gerais State Roads Directorate (DER-MG). Tariffs are set by those agencies and there are&#13;
no subsidies paid to bus operators.&#13;
1.5          The STU-BH (DEMETRO) system consists of a single line of 16.1 km, inaugurated in&#13;
1 986, which parallels the main east-west highway and presently serves about 50,000 passengers/day,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
instead of the 250,000 originally planned. One of the main reasons for this very low ridership is its&#13;
short length since the originally planned network was never completed due to budget problems.&#13;
Despite the fact that most of the systems, rolling stock, and equipment for the completion of the line&#13;
were already acquired through bilateral funding, the permanent way and the stations were not&#13;
completed because the Federal Government ran out of funds. As it stands today, the DEMETRO line&#13;
is not useful to alleviate the heavy traffic congestion in the BHMR and, instead, it is a financial burden&#13;
to the GOB which must contribute US$15 million/year to keep it afloat, since its revenues cover only&#13;
23 percent of the operating costs without depreciation.&#13;
1.6          At present, the DEMETRO is integrated with 74 bus lines in only one terminal (Eldorado)&#13;
which generates about 60 percent of its demand at an integrated tariff. CBTU estimates that with an&#13;
additional extension of only 6.5 km (S5o Paulo to Vilarinho), more frequent services, construction of&#13;
four stations, two intermodal integration terminals and a number of pedestrian crosswalks, demand&#13;
would increase substantially. For passengers who have their origins and destinations within walking&#13;
distance of the stations, the DEMETRO offers the most comfortable and reliable mode of transport.&#13;
However, if the origins and destinations are beyond a reasonable walking distance, the lack of good&#13;
integration, and the lack of stations at important demand generation centers, makes the use of the&#13;
system awkward and more expensive. This lack of integration between DEMETRO and buses&#13;
discourages more rail trips and encourages bus and automobile usage, thereby increasing the heavy&#13;
congestion during peak hours and significantly increasing home-to-work trip time. In its program to&#13;
decentralize the responsibility of operation of its metropolitan systems from the Federal Government&#13;
to the State and Municipal Governments, CBTU is proposing to extend the line by 6.5 km and provide&#13;
the most important stations with the appropriate transfer terminals and access, which would allow&#13;
effective modal integration, decrease the number of bus trips per day, and improve personal mobility&#13;
in the BHMR. Finally, since traffic congestion is growing at 20 percent per year and the number of&#13;
accidents grew by 30 percent from 1991 to 1994 (with 8.2 deaths/10,000 vehicles), BHMR needs&#13;
to modernize its traffic engineering and control equipment and introduce traffic safety measures to&#13;
cope with the growing number of road-based vehicles.&#13;
1.7          The low-income households (56 percent earn less than four minimum salaries, i.e., less&#13;
than US$400/month) are the main users of public transport and bear the brunt of its problems: (a)&#13;
shortage of capacity at peak hours resulting in overcrowded (&gt; 1 2 pass/m2), often unsafe conditions;&#13;
(b) long work journeys (2.5 hours/day) from the metropolitan periphery to the urban centers, often with&#13;
more than two modal transfers; and (c) paying over a fifth of their income in fares. Until recently the&#13;
lack of coordination among the three levels of government responsible for urban transport, particularly&#13;
between the SMG and the MBH, has led to poor tariff and modal integration, lack of prioritization in&#13;
urban transport investments, and no common policy on pricing and subsidies. Fortunately, the recent&#13;
establishment of a Metropolitan Council (Assembleia Metropolitana) which has a Transport&#13;
Commission, is a major step towards ensuring coordination between the several agencies and modal&#13;
policies.&#13;
C. Institutional Responsibilities for Urban Transport in the BHMR&#13;
1.8          There are four government bodies responsible for overseeing the urban transport sector&#13;
in the BHMR: (a) the State Roads Directorate (Direcao de Estradas de Rodagem do Estado de Minas&#13;
Gerais, DER-MG), which regulates all the intermunicipal bus services and road network of the region;&#13;
(b) the Belo Horizonte Transport and Transit Company (Empresa de Transporte e Transito de Belo&#13;
Horizonte, BHTRANS) which is the agency that regulates municipal bus services and is also responsible&#13;
for traffic management and control in the MBH; and (c) the Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos&#13;
(CBTU) which through its Belo Horizonte subdivision (STU-BH), known as DEMETRO, operates the&#13;
metropolitan train, presently under Federal Government jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
1.9         In 1993 the State established the BHMR Metropolitan Council (Assembleia&#13;
Metropolitana da RegiIo Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte, AMBEL). AMBEL's functions are, among&#13;
others, to foster the integration of metropolitan services, to oversee the metropolitan bodies, to&#13;
approve the Metropolitan Master Plan and supervise its implementation, to approve the multi-year&#13;
investment plans for the BHMR and its budget guidelines, to establish the guidelines for the tariff&#13;
policies on metropolitan public services including transport, and to administer the Metropolitan&#13;
Development Fund. AMBEL has a number of Sectoral Technical Committees, amongst which there are&#13;
the Intermunicipal Transport and Road Committee, the Land Use Committee, and Water Resources and&#13;
Environment Committee. Unfortunately, so far the only task performed by the Intermunicipal Transport&#13;
Committee is to discuss the increases in metropolitan bus tariffs. Nevertheless, AMBEL provides the&#13;
basic institutional framework required to create a Regional Transport Coordination Commission.&#13;
1.10         Both BHTRANS and DER-MG have a clearing house (Camara de Compensaciao) for bus&#13;
tariffs, and they pay bus services according to a standard cost formula which they approve. This way,&#13;
they compensate bus companies which operate with tariffs below the estimated cost of the formula.&#13;
BHTRANS' clearing house had a surplus of US$12 million in 1 994. Of these funds, BHTRANS transfers&#13;
1 0 percent to DER-MG whose clearing house has a deficit.&#13;
1.11         Since three levels of government have been formulating policies and regulating urban&#13;
transport without a formal coordinating arrangement, there has been a lack of consistency in the fares&#13;
charged by similar or competing modes, duplication of investments, absence of criteria to prioritize&#13;
investments, and only an embryonic modal integration system. This has led to bus services continuing&#13;
to operate in corridors where the DEMETRO operates, expensive and time-consuming disagreements&#13;
on whether to build a light rail transport, the lack of promotion of hub and spoke services, disparate&#13;
subsidy policies which are often based on non-economic considerations, and the absence of user&#13;
representation in the urban transport decision-making process. Recently, there has been a very fruitful&#13;
cooperation between BHTRANS, DER-MG and STU-BH. The creation of a Regional Transportation&#13;
Coordination Commission (RTCC) would ensure that this cooperation would not depend on the political&#13;
parties in power.&#13;
1.1 2        In summary, although the extent and quality of urban transport coordination and&#13;
planning vary among the different regions, all are faced with a similar problem: how to plan and&#13;
manage a transport system in a metropolitan region consisting of many municipalities, each with its&#13;
own administrative powers, when the necessary inputs for, and effects of, this transport system&#13;
extend well beyond the administrative boundaries of any one municipality. One solution would be to&#13;
create a region-wide transport coordinating and regulatory agency, which sometimes requires a state&#13;
law. In some Brazilian metropolitan regions, adaptations of this type of institution already exist and,&#13;
in others, plans (or, in some cases, draft laws) exist to create them. The examples provided by the&#13;
Madrid, Toronto, San Francisco and Washington metropolitan regions, which have some type of&#13;
coordinating entity, should be studied and adapted for the specific institutional constraints of the&#13;
BHMR. It is clear that one of the most urgent issues to be addressed in Brazilian urban transport is its&#13;
sector organization at the three levels of government.&#13;
1.13         The lack of a coordinating entity with a unified approach to cost-recovery policies and&#13;
the lack of effective oversight by the State and the Municipality, have resulted in the poor definition&#13;
of priorities in the BHMR, limited modal and tariff integration, and operating agencies which have no&#13;
pre-set operational and financial targets. As required by the proposed project, SMG, MBH, the&#13;
Municipality of Betim and the Municipality of Contagem signed a convenio to create a Permanent&#13;
Integrated Planning Group (GPPI) which will function as a precursor of the RTCC. A formal RTCC will&#13;
be established prior to the transfer of STU-BH to the state.&#13;
&#13;

D. Key Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.14         A number of key issues must be addressed to in order to improve the supply of urban&#13;
transport services in the BHMR and to guarantee their orderly development and sustainability in the&#13;
long term. They are: la) capacity and safety issues; (b) institutional issues; (c) cost recovery and&#13;
financial management issues; (d) targeting of subsidies; (e) environmental issues; and (f) transport&#13;
planning issues.&#13;
1.1 5        Capacity and Safety Issues. The most important concern is the need to increase the&#13;
supply of adequate cost-efficient peak-hour capacity in order to guarantee an acceptable level of&#13;
service to the average commuter under reasonable safety conditions. This can be done by: (a)&#13;
rehabilitating and restructuring existing systems and by building new ones which are justified from a&#13;
technical, economic and, especially, financial standpoint. Rail and bus rapid transit offer the best&#13;
alternatives in this respect; (b) improving traffic management through appropriate traffic engineering&#13;
equipment in order to better manage available road space and reduce congestion; and (c) reducing&#13;
accidents through transit safety education campaigns, law enforcement, and traffic engineering. The&#13;
STU-BH extension to Vilarinho and the traffic management and control program address these issues.&#13;
1.16         Institutional Issues. The most critical institutional issues are: (a) the fine-tuning of&#13;
relations between state and municipal governments and a clear definition of their respective roles in&#13;
the financing, planning and operation of urban transport services in accordance with the 1988&#13;
Constitution; (b) the creation of a regional coordination entity empowered by the BHMR for planning,&#13;
coordinating and setting priorities for new investments and modal integration; and (c) the appropriate&#13;
modification of regulations, including the elimination of regulatory barriers which might prevent free&#13;
entry and/or competition in the market for provision of public transport services. The project addresses&#13;
these issues by requiring the establishment of a RTCC for the BHMR.&#13;
1.17         Cost Recovery and Financial Management Issues. The need to address cost recovery&#13;
from a more commercially oriented standpoint by: (a) setting tariffs which, when added to subsidies,&#13;
cover at least the long-run variable costs (defined as out-of-pocket costs plus depreciation of&#13;
equipment and cost of capital) of the service provided; (b) controlling fare evasion; (c) setting&#13;
appropriate peak and off-peak pricing; (d) improving the financial management of the systems through&#13;
wide-ranging cost cutting measures, staff rationalization policies, and by appointing more financial&#13;
managers to run the mass transit systems; and Ce) revamping funding mechanisms in order to&#13;
guarantee adequate financing for the implementation of new mass transit systems and the&#13;
sustainability of the existing systems. The proposed project addresses these issues by the Institutional&#13;
Development and Policy component.&#13;
1.18         Targeting of Subsidies. Any remaining blanket subsidies paid to operators ought to be&#13;
eliminated. Urban households have been devoting increasingly large proportions of their incomes to&#13;
transport. Further, transport-related expenditures have become a considerable burden on local&#13;
government budgets. The appropriate targeting of urban transport subsidies and their extension to the&#13;
informal sector which is not presently covered by mechanisms such as the vale-transporte is a major&#13;
issue which must be addressed in the short term. C'Vale-transporte' is a mechanism by which&#13;
employers are required to provide their employees with a wage subsidy that covers any amount above&#13;
6 percent whenever the total costs of monthly "home to work' trips exceed 6 percent of their&#13;
salaries.) Appropriate mechanisms for financing such subsidies (tariff differentiation, contractual&#13;
budgetary transfers, etc.) and channelling them to target groups through tokens, multi-modal passes,&#13;
and differential tariffs need to be designed. The financing mechanisms and the cost and tariff studies&#13;
proposed in the Institutional Development component address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
1.19         Environmental Issues. Air pollution, noise, traffic congestion, and road accidents are&#13;
major environmental issues to be addressed in the BHMR. The reduction of the environmental impacts&#13;
of urban transport, traffic congestion, and noise pollution in the urban area could be done through:&#13;
(a) the allocation of responsibilities across government levels for the enforcement of existing laws and&#13;
definition of tougher standards; (b) the use of cleaner and quieter transport systems; (c) where&#13;
appropriate, the use of non-motorized transport; (d) the improvement of traffic management and&#13;
control; and (e) the strengthening of traffic safety education and the enforcement of the traffic&#13;
regulations. In the long run, assessment of the potential role of market-based incentives to address&#13;
pollution and the implementation of the polluter pay principle to minimize the fiscal burden implied by&#13;
de facto government subsidies to polluters ought to be considered. The proposed project starts&#13;
addressing these issues by requiring the design of an inspection/maintenance program for motor&#13;
vehicles.&#13;
1.20         Transport Planning Issues. The need to strengthen BHMR's transportation planning,&#13;
traffic data base, traffic management, and evaluation of new investments could be met if there is a&#13;
formal coordinating agency for urban transport in the metropolitan region. This agency should be&#13;
equipped with a battery of sketch planning, demand and supply models that would test different land&#13;
use, air quality, and urban transport scenarios. Furthermore, an integrated land use, urban transport,&#13;
and air quality strategy should be designed and periodically revised. As part of the proposed project,&#13;
the Institutional Development component includes provisions for the preparation of an Integrated Land&#13;
Use, Urban Transport and Air Quality strategy and the updating of BHMR's Master Plan.&#13;
1.21         In the future, urban transport policies in the BHMR would be geared toward the efficient&#13;
and equitable provision of urban transport services, in particular for low-income groups which have&#13;
traditionally received less attention. Policies would be consistent with broad transport sector objectives,&#13;
as well as with the objectives of the urban subsector. In accordance with the 1 988 Constitution, the&#13;
policies would support the decentralization of urban transport services from the Federal Government&#13;
to the States to facilitate modal and tariff integration and respond quickly to local needs. The policies&#13;
would simultaneously address the need for institutional coordination and an integrated urban transport,&#13;
land use, and environmental strategy. The general approach is to restore the incentives which exist&#13;
when privately-owned systems operate under competitive conditions. Re-designed regulations and&#13;
concessionary agreements, and improved bidding processes will promote competition in the provision&#13;
of bus services. Rates would be liberalized in the corridors where there is effective competition. Urban&#13;
and metropolitan train operations would be decentralized through the reorganization of CBTU and the&#13;
gradual transfer of the operation and ownership of the systems to newly-created commuter train&#13;
companies, managed either directly by the state and/or local governments or by private interests&#13;
operating under concessionary arrangements. Appropriate tariffs and financing mechanisms would&#13;
enable the efficient operation and development of the systems. Local governments would continue to&#13;
be responsible for traffic regulation and management but would improve their capacity to manage the&#13;
demand for road use, improve traffic management and street maintenance, protect the environment,&#13;
monitor the effects of regulations and taxation, promote integration of the various transport systems,&#13;
and coordination with land-use development.&#13;
E. Lessons from Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.22         Initial Bank support for the urban transport sector in Brazil was provided through four&#13;
urban transport projects totalling US$540 million, of which the First, Second and Third Urban Transport&#13;
Projects (Loans 1563-BR, 1839-BR, 1965-BR) have been completed. The Fourth Urban Transport&#13;
Project which continued the work started in the Third project was canceled because the government&#13;
abolished the federal agency in charge of urban transport (EBTU). Additional urban transport projects&#13;
financed by the Bank (Loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR for US$126 million and US$128 million&#13;
respectively) support the rehabilitation and decentralization of the CBTU from the federal to the state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
government in S3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Loan 3457-BR (Sao Paulo) became effective on February&#13;
3, 1993. This loan includes an institutional and policy development component which was utilized in&#13;
the preparation of the presently proposed project. Loan 3633-BR (Rio de Janeiro) was signed on&#13;
October 14, 1993 and became effective on March 14, 1994.&#13;
1.23         To build upon the experience of past urban transport projects for the design of the&#13;
proposed project, an analysis of "lessons learned" was undertaken (Annex 1). The review was based&#13;
on Project Completion Reports and Performance Audit Reports (PCR/PAR) in urban transport and urban&#13;
development worldwide. Recognition was made of trends and changes in project design since the&#13;
PCRs/PARs were completed. The main lessons identified and incorporated in the design of the&#13;
proposed project are:&#13;
(a)   Institutional Strengthening. The organizations dealing with urban transport at&#13;
the federal, state and municipal levels should be reorganized and strengthened.&#13;
Studies included in the institutional component must be carefully monitored&#13;
and translated in action plans which the Borrower must implement;&#13;
(b)   Lack of counterpart funding has greatly influenced the pace of project&#13;
implementation and in some cases has led to cancellation of components. An&#13;
effort must be made to ensure that adequate provision of counterpart funds are&#13;
included in the annual budgets of federal and state enterprises;&#13;
(c)   Slow implementation has been a frequently occurring theme. The reasons have&#13;
included: lack of familiarity with Bank procedures, over-optimistic scheduling&#13;
at appraisal, lack of final engineering designs at appraisal, changes in political&#13;
commitment, and lack of counterpart funds. These problems would be&#13;
mitigated in the proposed project by such measures as: strengthening capacity&#13;
of operating agencies for financial management and application of Bank&#13;
procedures; and requiring final engineering design of the first year's works, for&#13;
which technical assistance should be contracted if need be with retroactive&#13;
financing; and&#13;
(d)   Weak institutional capacity for the planning, design and implementation of&#13;
traffic and highway projects has been a common feature of many projects. In&#13;
the proposed project, all agencies have demonstrated adequate capacity to&#13;
carry out the required planning, design and implementation functions.&#13;
F. The Bank's Strategy for the BHMR&#13;
1.24         Subsector strategy. In view of the issues stated above, the Bank's strategy will be&#13;
aimed at: In the short term: (a) assisting the state and municipal governments in formulating and&#13;
implementing an urban transport policy consistent with the above goals; (b) strengthening the&#13;
institutional framework and the decision-making process in the sector through adequate coordination&#13;
between the two levels of government and proper technical, economic and especially, financial&#13;
evaluation of projects and their prioritization by a regional coordination agency; (c) supporting a&#13;
program to decentralize, rehabilitate and extend existing services such as metro lines and busways,&#13;
which can more readily increase their efficiency and peak-hour capacity; (d) managing the demand for&#13;
road use through improved traffic management and road-user taxes, in order to reduce existing&#13;
congestion and the demand for travel by private single-occupancy automobiles; (e) decreasing the&#13;
number of fatalities and accidents due to urban transport; (f) introducing better cost-recovery&#13;
mechanisms including adequate cost-based peak-hour tariffs and fare evasion control in order to&#13;
strengthen their financial base; and (g) improving the targeting of subsidies to those who need them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
In the medium term, the Bank's strategy will focus on promoting a more efficient and financially&#13;
sustainable market-oriented supply of public transport services, through: (a) an appropriate reform of&#13;
regulations which will facilitate market entry, fare deregulation and public bidding in route allocation;&#13;
(b) promoting service differentiation especially in the bus systems; (c) defining eligibility requirements&#13;
and strengthening funding mechanisms for urban transport to cover operating deficits (based on pre-&#13;
agreed targets in contract-plans) and finance major investments; (d) supporting the evaluation and, if&#13;
justified, the introduction of new investments such as reserved busways and light rail transport; (e)&#13;
reducing the environmental impacts of urban transport by setting standards for air quality, noise&#13;
pollution, and visual intrusion along with indicating who would pay for them and how; (f) assisting in&#13;
projects which improve the data base required for appropriate planning such as origin/destination&#13;
surveys and preparation of master plans which study land use and urban transport alternatives; and&#13;
(g) creating an enabling environment to increase private sector participation in the investment and&#13;
operations of urban transport systems. In the long term, the Bank's strategy will aim at reducing the&#13;
travel demand and increasing the effectiveness of transport facilities by integrating land use and&#13;
transport planning based on significant input or management by locally affected parties.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Background&#13;
2.1          As mentioned in section 1, this project has its origins in two major developments at the&#13;
Federal and State level: (a) the decision of the Government of Brazil to decentralize and transfer the&#13;
several subdivisions of the Brazilian Urban Train Company (Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos,&#13;
CBTU) from the Federal to the State/Municipal Governments as mandated by the 1 988 Constitution;&#13;
(b) the willingness of the State of Minas Gerais and the municipality of Belo Horizonte to takeover the&#13;
Belo Horizonte subdivision of the CBTU (STU-BH) to better integrate it with the predominantly public&#13;
bus transport system. The GOB started by decentralizing the two largest CBTU subdivisions (S3o Paulo&#13;
and Rio de Janeiro), and once that was successfully accomplished, it decided to proceed with the&#13;
decentralization of the Belo Horizonte and Recife subdivisions.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.2          The Bank's country assistance strategy for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 29,&#13;
1 993, is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and social&#13;
development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation,&#13;
increased efficiency in the public sector and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems&#13;
to the poor. The proposed project is fully consistent with this assistance strategy since it is designed&#13;
to: (a) promote reforms and financial viability of public enterprises, including decentralization from&#13;
federal to state and municipal levels; (b) foster private sector participation in the development of new&#13;
infrastructure and its operation; (c) increase the efficiency of infrastructure investments; (d) contribute&#13;
to poverty alleviation; and (e) reduce Government subsidies through improved tariff policies and&#13;
financial management. The proposed project is also a follow-up to the efforts started with the Sao&#13;
Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR) and the Rio de Janeiro&#13;
Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR) which are decentralizing the federally-&#13;
owned CBTU to the States of S3o Paulo and Rio to allow for more effective modal and tariff&#13;
integration.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
2.3          The objectives of the proposed project are: (a) the development of an integrated urban&#13;
transport system for the BHMR under a Regional Transportation Coordination Commission (RTCC)&#13;
established to coordinate and recommend common policies on pricing, regulation, financing, project&#13;
evaluation and selection; (b) the completion and decentralization of the STU-BH from the federal to the&#13;
state and municipal levels; (c) the reduction of the environmental (mainly air quality and noise) impacts&#13;
on the BHMR due to motor vehicles and the promotion of non-motorized transport modes; and (d) the&#13;
development of special strategies and actions to improve the accessibility of the low-income population&#13;
to employment centers, health and education facilities.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
2.4          The project would consist of three inter-related components: (a) an Infrastructure and&#13;
Equipment component (98 percent of total project cost) to help build: (i) the rail extension of the STU-&#13;
BH and the additional stations required to enhance modal integration; (ii) the transfer terminals and&#13;
physical accesses required for the actual integration between buses, rail, pedestrians, automobiles and&#13;
bicycles; and (iii) a centralized road traffic signal control system to improve traffic control at some 250&#13;
intersections; (b) an Environmental and Traffic Safety component (0.2 percent of total project cost)&#13;
to support: (i) the design of an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for vehicle emissions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
noise; and (ii) a traffic management and safety program; and (c) an Institutional and Policy&#13;
Development component (1.8 percent of total project cost) to help in: (i) creating the RTCC for the&#13;
BHMR; (ii) preparing an integrated Transport Policy, Land Use, and Air Quality Management strategy&#13;
for the BHMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and to introduce sound cost-recovery,&#13;
tariff, regulatory and subsidy policies; (iii) implementing a cost-based financial management system in&#13;
the STU-BH; (iv) developing an enabling environment and financial instruments for more substantial&#13;
participation of the private sector in the investment and operation of the operating agencies; and (v)&#13;
strengthening air-quality planning and monitoring of vehicle-based emissions.&#13;
Part A - Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
2.5   This component is designed to improve the infrastructure and equipment of STU-BH to a level&#13;
which will allow it to meet the operational and financial targets set for the proposed project (Annex&#13;
11) and are summarized below.&#13;
2.6          The Civil Works Program would consist of: (a) intermodal integration works which&#13;
would include: (i) construction of three integrated bus-to-rail terminals; (ii) improvements to road&#13;
accesses to STU-BH stations; (iii) construction of sidewalks and pedestrian over/underpasses; and (iv)&#13;
provision of a centralized traffic signal control system and bus locator; (b) passenger stations works&#13;
for the construction of nine new stations and enlargement/improvements of S3o Paulo station; (c)&#13;
bridges, road viaducts, and pedestrian over/underpasses, which would include the construction of four&#13;
bridges, two road viaducts, and six over/underpasses for pedestrians; and (d} the construction of a&#13;
building for STU-BH administration.&#13;
2.7          The Permanent Way Program would include: (a) provision of track materials for a 5 km&#13;
line from Santa Ines to Sao Paulo; and (b) construction of a 6.5-km line extension from Sao Paulo to&#13;
Vilarinho (Map IBRD 26914), including the construction of a 225 m tunnel for which detailed geological&#13;
studies have already been completed.&#13;
2.8          The Systems Program would consist of: (a) electrification, including the installation of&#13;
7 km of overhead catenary, 7 km of transmission cables, one sub-station and one sectionalizing cabin;&#13;
(b) signaling, consisting of: (i) the replacement of the existing Central Traffic Control (CTC) from&#13;
Eldorado to Sao Paulo; lii) the installation of vital interlocking relay circuits in the 5-km section from&#13;
Santa Ines to Sao Paulo with materials and equipment in stock; and (iii) supply and installation of a new&#13;
signaling system in the 6.5-km extension; and (c) telecommunications, including the provision of a&#13;
central station, an integrated telecommunication system on the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho extension, and&#13;
ticketing control equipment in all 20 stations.&#13;
2.9          The Workshop Program includes the provision of miscellaneous equipment for the new&#13;
Matadouro workshop, and of equipment for general maintenance of the permanent way and systems.&#13;
The Rolling Stock program would consist of: (a) the general overhaul of five existing electrical multiple&#13;
units (EMUs); and (b) the acquisition of ten new EMUs.&#13;
Part B - Environmental and Traffic Safety Program&#13;
2.10         The environmental and traffic safety program will consist of: (a) the design of an&#13;
inspection and maintenance (Il/M) program for vehicle emissions and noise; and (b) the development&#13;
of a traffic management and safety program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Part C - Institutional Development and Policy&#13;
2.1 1        CBTU's decentralization is not by itself a guarantee that the individual subdivisions will&#13;
be better managed than its predecessors. A package of institutional and policy reforms are needed to&#13;
induce modernization changes and motivate management and staff. The financial management and&#13;
administration, especially in regard to cost-recovery mechanisms must also be reformed. Otherwise,&#13;
the cycle for another emergency program of rehabilitation will repeat itself with negative impacts on&#13;
the ridership and on the metropolitan region as a whole. Furthermore, actions are needed to change&#13;
the environment in which CBTU operates in order to facilitate the modal integration and sustainability&#13;
desired in the long term. The basic sub-components of the institutional and policy package proposed&#13;
are described in detail in Annex 7 and are summarized below:&#13;
(a)    Decentralization. The first set of Actions Plans concerns the actual&#13;
decentralization process: (i) institutional and organizational arrangements; (ii)&#13;
patrimonial agreement on the valuation and assets to transferred; (iii) aspects&#13;
relating to transfer of personnel, pension benefits, and miscellaneous human&#13;
resource-related issues; and (iv) legal and administrative aspects for&#13;
decentralization;&#13;
(b)   Management. The second set of Action Plans are designed to improve the&#13;
management of the STU-BH subdivision: (i) preparation and implementation of&#13;
a manpower development plan to streamline the management and operations&#13;
staff of the STU-BH that would propose concise job descriptions and staff it&#13;
accordingly; (ii) study and implementing of cost accounting, management&#13;
information systems, and financial management so that timely and adequate&#13;
cost management is possible; (iii) preparation of an action plan to improve&#13;
inventory management since lack of spares is one of the main causes for the&#13;
low rolling stock availability rates; (iv) preparation of an action plan to&#13;
subcontract maintenance and other operations to the private sector;&#13;
(v) preparation of an action plan to increase non-operating revenues by renting&#13;
station space, advertising, and development of the STU-BH's real estate; and&#13;
(vi) technical assistance and training for staff at all levels as proposed in the&#13;
manpower development plan.&#13;
(c)   Modal Integration. The objective of the third set of Action Plans is to support&#13;
the policy framework and provide practical recommendations for implementing&#13;
modal integration. This will include studies of existing transport agencies with&#13;
a view to reducing intermodal inefficiencies, namely: (i) a financing mechanism&#13;
study focused on achieving formal sources of funds for the urban transport&#13;
sector, including a tariff study focused on achieving multi-modal tariff&#13;
integration and its operationalization; (ii) updating of the Transport, Land Use,&#13;
and Air Quality portion of the Master Plans of the BHMR with emphasis on&#13;
route rationalization and modal and tariff integration; and (iii) a BHTRANS/DER-&#13;
MG route management and rationalization study.&#13;
E. Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.12         The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$197.3 million including physical&#13;
and price contingencies, with an estimated foreign component of US$98.8 million or about 50 percent&#13;
of total cost. Taxes and duties are expected to account for about 13.5 percent of total costs or&#13;
US$26.7 million equivalent. Physical contingencies add up to US$16.6 million, or 10 percent of the&#13;
base cost, and price contingencies are estimated at US$15.0 million or 8.2 percent of the base cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
plus physical contingencies. The contingencies were estimated on the basis of the disbursement&#13;
schedule (an estimated implementation period of six years), and on the following forecast of price&#13;
escalation for both local and foreign expenditures expressed in US dollars: 1.5 percent in 1 995, 1.8&#13;
percent in 1996, 2.6 percent in 1997, 2.5 percent in 1998, 2.5 percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000&#13;
and 2.5 percent in 2001. Base costs correspond to March 1995 prices. The costs of goods are based&#13;
upon supplier quotations for similar Brazilian-made items and recent prices of imported items. The cost&#13;
of several components of the works program such as, permanent way, two new stations, and the&#13;
administrative building are based upon detailed engineer designs and prevailing unit prices; the cost&#13;
of other components of the works program are based upon preliminary engineering designs and&#13;
prevailing unit prices from recent tenders under loans 3457-BR and 3633-BR. Final engineering designs&#13;
for the remaining components under the project are underway. Cost estimates for consultant services&#13;
are based upon prevailing local and foreign staff-months rate; they provide for the cost of local&#13;
transportation, office equipment and other minor items and, where appropriate, international travel and&#13;
per diem.&#13;
2.13         The project would be financed from the proposed Bank loan of US$99.0 million (50&#13;
percent of the project cost) and GOB contributions of about US$98.4 million equivalent, including&#13;
US$26.69 million in taxes and duties (50 percent of the project cost). During loan negotiations,&#13;
agreement was be reached on: (a) the project financing plan; and (b) the guarantee of the GOB&#13;
regarding all necessary counterpart funds for the project.&#13;
F. Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
2.14         Project Benefits. Quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are expected from the&#13;
provision of an integrated rail and bus network including cost savings, time savings for the users, fewer&#13;
accidents and fatalities and employment generation through better spatial integration of markets.&#13;
Important effects on the urban structure are expected if the STU-BH network becomes an axis fed by&#13;
the major bus routes. In addition, there will be a positive environmental impact through the reduction&#13;
of fossil fuel consumption, reduction of motor-vehicle related emissions, and a reduction in road&#13;
congestion, with a consequent improvement in air quality and noise pollution. The project will facilitate&#13;
access to employment and services, particularly for the poor. Development of an integrated public&#13;
transport system under a regional coordination body in charge of combining state and municipal pricing&#13;
and subsidy policies, prioritizing major investments and proposing common demand management&#13;
measures in the BHMR, are also important non-quantifiable benefits. Finally, by encouraging greater&#13;
private sector participation in the development of aerial and ground station space, the proposed project&#13;
will be a first step towards decreasing the investment burden on the state.&#13;
2.15         Project Risks. The main risks involved are the delays in the dialogue between the two&#13;
levels of government for the actual start of operations of the RTCC, the political reluctance to&#13;
introduce regulatory and air quality related policies which are politically unpopular, the possible delays&#13;
in the procurement process, the delays in the actual transfer of STU-BH to the local authorities, and&#13;
the timely availability of counterpart funds. Negotiations among the Federal, State and Municipal&#13;
Governments have progressed very well for modal and tariff coordination and a forerunner of the RTCC&#13;
has already been established. All parties have agreed on the need for an integrated project and the risks&#13;
are more associated with their reluctance to relinquish some of the powers they have to the RTCC. At&#13;
this stage, there is strong commitment to the environmental and safety program from the governments&#13;
involved. The delays in the procurement process were minimized by starting at pre-appraisal the pre-&#13;
qualification for lots in the critical path of project implementation, by the use of standard bidding&#13;
documents, and by requiring the borrower to produce the major tender documents by negotiations. The&#13;
timely availability of counterpart funds will be addressed by seeking assurances that they are included&#13;
in GOB's CY95 budget and future budgets projections.&#13;

G. Tariff Setting and Affordability by Low-income Users&#13;
2.16                Poverty, Affordability and Subsidies. The growing crisis in urban transportation&#13;
in Brazil, especially in the MRs, demands a close look at alternatives for financing services in a more&#13;
predictable and sustainable way while, at the same time, targeting subsidies more directly to low-&#13;
income ridership. The various initiatives already underway within CBTU to improve efficiency through&#13;
tariff increases, service improvements, and trip reliability, as well as efforts focused on reducing&#13;
operating costs, are planned to continue.&#13;
2.1 7        Approximately 56 percent of the urban population earns less than four minimum salaries&#13;
(US$400/month). If successfully implemented, the project will primarily benefit the poor in the&#13;
participating cities, since they depend mainly on bus, metro and suburban rail services to commute to&#13;
and from work, especially those living in the favelas for whom access to the areas of employment is&#13;
a daily ordeal.&#13;
2.18         To make urban transport affordable to the poor, it is necessary to strengthen and&#13;
expand the eligibility of the vale-transporte program to low-income residents which are not formally&#13;
employed, to substantially promote integrated (bus-rail) fares, which should be always lower than the&#13;
sum of individual modal fares, and to increase the overall level of service provided to the users. This&#13;
will result in lower travel times due to higher frequencies and operating speeds, reduction of waiting&#13;
time, much higher reliability and safety, bringing down therefore, the overall generalized (tariff, time&#13;
and safety) transport cost to the user and thus alleviating the burden that urban transportation imposes&#13;
on low-income households. It is noteworthy that annual bus and train passenger surveys indicate even&#13;
low-income riders are willing to pay higher tariffs if the service provided is faster, waiting times are&#13;
less, and the system is more reliable.&#13;
2.19          Review of Financing Mechanisms. In conclusion, it was agreed that efforts should be&#13;
focused on seeking a solution(s) that would: (a) generate sufficient resources to maintain stable and&#13;
predictable funding for urban transport investments; (b) establish mechanisms to generate adequate&#13;
operating cross-subsidies from within transport related taxes, user charges, etc., to provide adequate&#13;
support for normalization (operating deficits) transfers; and (c) contract with an independent consultant&#13;
to provide a structured leadership to a Tariff and Financial Policy study, to conduct discussions at the&#13;
federal, state and local levels, and to help in drafting the appropriate legislation to implement such&#13;
policy reforms at the national level.&#13;
2.20         In the meantime, agreement was reached at negotiations so that: (a) prior to the&#13;
transfer of STU-BH to the State, the GOB will meet the cost of capital investments plus debt service&#13;
(interest and amortization) of the STU-BH, incurred before the transfer; (b) during the period prior to&#13;
the transfer, the GOB will cover the difference between the working costs and operating revenues of&#13;
STU-BH; (c) and that after the transfer is effected, the GOB operating subsidy (shortfall between&#13;
operating revenues and working expenses) will be discontinued.&#13;
H. Project Economic Evaluation&#13;
2.21         A standard cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact of the&#13;
implementation of the proposed Investment and Equipment program, which together represent 98&#13;
percent of the total proposed project. Direct user benefits include travel time and operating costs&#13;
savings; indirect benefits arise from the reduction of negative externalities such as accident and air&#13;
pollution costs. Investments which will be avoided due to the implementation of the proposed project&#13;
are also considered as benefits. Investment costs comprise civil works, land expropriation, operational&#13;
systems, rolling stock and project studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.22         Substantial direct benefits are expected to arise from travel time savings, operating cost&#13;
savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings. Travel time savings result&#13;
mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the modernized system and from existing STU-BH&#13;
passengers who can save time in their trips by taking advantage of the new transport facility. Travel&#13;
time savings also result from the increased operating speeds and shorter trips of the buses and cars&#13;
which will be feeding the rail system. Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive principally&#13;
from the improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and cars,&#13;
respectively. In addition, indirect benefits will arise from the reduction in negative externalities, such&#13;
as accidents and air pollution.&#13;
2.23   The IERRs obtained in the economic evaluation are summarized in the Table 2.2. The&#13;
sensitivity analysis on traffic forecasts, increased investment costs, deferral of benefits, etc., produced&#13;
acceptable results which ranged from 14.2 percent (case in which the incremental traffic was 50&#13;
percent lower than estimated) to 32.3 percent (case in which the value of time savings is 10 percent&#13;
higher). A more detailed description of the economic evaluation is given in Annex 9.&#13;

I. Project Financial Evaluation&#13;
2.24         STU-BH. STU-BH's sources and uses of funds for operations shows that internally&#13;
generated funds are low and fixed personnel costs are high. During 1 990-94, the cost recovery from&#13;
internally generated funds varied between 6-1 5 percent. Besides low tariffs, the main reason for low&#13;
revenues is a lack of ridership due to the short length of the network. In 1 994, the actual ridership was&#13;
one-fifth of what the system was designed to carry had it been fully completed; the length of the&#13;
system is less than one-third of the original network used for that forecast. It is no surprise, therefore,&#13;
that the personnel cost accounted for three-forth of the total working costs!' in that year and the&#13;
resulting working ratio"' was a humble 6.87.&#13;
2.25          Upon completion of the new capital projects, the length of the network would be&#13;
expanded by 67 percent and the traffic is expected to grow seven-fold during 1 994-2001. This&#13;
increase in traffic is expected to result from a longer network, shorter headways, more intensive&#13;
operations, and a higher number of integrated stations which will be fed by redesigned bus routes. A&#13;
combination of higher demand, increases and changes in the tariff structure, and less than proportional&#13;
increase in costs is expected to result in a revenue cost coverage of 100 percent (a working ratio of&#13;
1.05) in 2001. In addition to the measures outlined above, about 5 percent of the operating income&#13;
is expected to come from advertisement and rental of properties. Consequently, the system is expected&#13;
to be free from public subsidy for its normal operations starting in 2001. Performance targets to&#13;
monitor STU-BH's financial situation during the project are given below.&#13;

2.26         State of Minas Gerais. Sound fiscal and financial management over the last several&#13;
years places the State of Minas Gerais in a relatively stable financial condition, despite recession and&#13;
macroeconomic difficulties at the national level. The State relies on own sources (ICMS and other&#13;
taxes) for about 71 percent of its total current receipts. As of the end of 1 993, current revenues were&#13;
US$3.4 billion, comprised of: US$2.4 billion own-source tax revenues and US$790 million (23&#13;
percent) from federal government transfers. On the expenditure side, 1993 current expenses were&#13;
about 66 percent of all expenditures (current and capital including amortization), with personnel costs&#13;
accounting for 36 percent. The remaining 37 percent went towards capital expenditures including&#13;
amortization payments of US$514 million (11 percent). In 1993, personnel expenditures amounted to&#13;
63 percent of the net current revenue (current revenue less contractual transfers) compared to a&#13;
constitutional limit of 65 percent.&#13;
2.27         In response to increasing amortization and interest payments which in 1992 topped&#13;
US$1.1 billion, the State has severely curtailed new borrowing. Net borrowing which became negative&#13;
in 1991 continued being so for three straight year and the 1993 debt service of US$767 million was&#13;
about 31 percent lower than that of 1992. The state successfully rescheduled its long-term contractual&#13;
debt obligations in 1 994 (contractual debt is about 65 percent of total debt) in order to lower the&#13;
annual debt service burden.&#13;
2.28         Current low cost recovery of STU-BH will oblige the State to make operational subsidies&#13;
of an average US$19 million between 1996-2000 with the maximum subsidy of US$26 million in&#13;
2000. With the extended network operational in 2001, STU-BH is not expected to rely on any public&#13;
subsidy for its normal operations except for the replacement of assets. Nonetheless, even with the&#13;
expected level of subsidy until 2000, the total State transfers will increase only by 2.5 percent. In&#13;
comparison to the current surplus, the increase in transfers would account to about 6 percent of the&#13;
current account surplus (US$432 million) in 1993. The State is also expected to compensate STU-BH&#13;
US$3-4 million for carrying gratuitos (free riders). This compensation should, however, not be&#13;
considered a subsidy as it is sales of services by STU-BH to the government.&#13;
J. Environmental Impact of the Project&#13;
2.29         Since the main objective of the proposed project is to increase the capacity offered by&#13;
the BHMR rail system, it is expected that a substantial percentage of the passengers now carried by&#13;
bus will return to their original mode of transportation, that is, rail. This is especially true for&#13;
passengers who live within walking distance from the stations, who switched to bus because in the&#13;
last five years the capacity and safety offered by the trains decreased considerably. However, it is not&#13;
so obvious for those passengers who are not within walking distance. Nevertheless, theoretically it is&#13;
estimated that by project completion about 316 fewer buses/day will be required in the streets of the&#13;
BHMR, because integration with the metro system will shorten bus trips. The main expected positive&#13;
environmental impacts stem from this reduction in bus services, given their present negative impact&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
on the air quality, noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents. As discussed below, other&#13;
positive impacts include the effect of the rail system rehabilitation on passenger safety at the stations,&#13;
on the land use around the right-of-way, and the decrease of fatal accidents resulting from lack of&#13;
fencing along the right-of-way.&#13;
2.30         The impact on air quality is due to a reduction of emission by the buses which will be&#13;
removed from circulation or which will have their route-kms shortened because they will be operating&#13;
feeder services for the rail system rather than duplicating their routes. The impact on air quality was&#13;
conservatively estimated at US$1.2 million per year in BHMR. A positive impact on noise levels is also&#13;
due to the removal of buses, especially in Belo Horizonte, where the older vehicles predominantly&#13;
owned by the private sector are noisy and when bunched together, cause very high decibel (dB) levels,&#13;
which hardly allow people to speak at normal voice levels on the street. The impact on traffic&#13;
congestion was estimated at US$37.0 million per year in Belo Horizonte and is mainly due to the&#13;
shorter waiting time for commuters using their automobiles and buses. The effect on road accidents&#13;
is based on statistics which suggest that, in the metropolitan region, the number of bus accidents is&#13;
a function of the number of buses on the road. It is conservatively estimated that the savings due to&#13;
fewer accidents are US$0.7 million per year in Belo Horizonte. In addition, the fencing of the right-of-&#13;
way is expected to decrease the number of fatal accidents due to people crossing the tracks. Even if&#13;
the benefits estimated were cut in half because the bus operators would, in some cases, continue to&#13;
run the buses at lower load factors, the project would contribute positively to the environment.&#13;
Benefits which were not quantified are those related to the improved living environment which will&#13;
result from safer and cleaner stations, crossovers from the sidewalks to the stations, space for queuing&#13;
up at the wickets, ramps for the handicapped, and in some cases, modal integration with taxis, buses&#13;
and private automobiles. Other non-quantified benefits are those related to the structuring effect of&#13;
a revamped rail system which will attract housing in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, real estate&#13;
development on the air space above the stations and on land owned by CBTU is also expected.&#13;
Additional non-quantified benefits relate to the diminished stress which the road system and congestion&#13;
will impart on the road users and the better ambience expected in trains. Shorter trip times and faster&#13;
home-to-work trips will also have a positive effect on the rail users' welfare.&#13;
Jl. Environmental Impact of the Construction&#13;
2.31         The proposed extension of the system would have only limited negative environmental&#13;
impacts. Most materials used will not affect the environment; the contractors will be responsible for&#13;
proper disposal of old materials; the earthworks are mainly in CBTU's existing right-of-way. Concrete&#13;
ties will be used. The visual impact of the stations will be enhanced with appropriate architectural&#13;
designs which will blend with the environment, and the same will be done with the overhead catenary,&#13;
wherever possible. Assurances will be sought that the project will be executed, and the system&#13;
subsequently operated in accordance with Bank guidelines and good environmental practices.&#13;
2.32         An environmental impact assessment of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link undertaken by&#13;
independent consultants is required by Brazilian law. A preliminary analysis following Bank guidelines&#13;
was provided during the Bank mission in March 1 995 and has subsequently been reviewed and&#13;
approved by the Bank. During pre-appraisal, the following were made available: (a) a typology of the&#13;
affected population and of proposed solutions; (b) the institutional matrix, which supports the&#13;
expropriation process, specifying for each activity the responsibilities of CBTU's various units as well&#13;
as those of other agencies and the relationship of social and environmental management within the&#13;
overall project coordination arrangements; (c) a chronogram of all activities pertaining to expropriation&#13;
and related activities to be carried out by CBTU or other agencies, including consultations with the&#13;
affected population and the possibilities of delays in beginning of construction if compensation offered&#13;
to the affected population were to be rejected; and (d) a budget estimate and sources of funds required&#13;
for expropriation and other related activities.&#13;
&#13;

2.33         The terms of reference for preparing the final engineering designs for future stations&#13;
and proposed terminals require that existing environmental (noise and visual intrusion) conditions be&#13;
reviewed and that the final designs include specific measures for alleviating conditions where they fail&#13;
to meet existing or proposed standards. In addition, an environmental assessment will be required on&#13;
all proposals for new works, indicating any adverse environmental consequences and proposing&#13;
measures to eliminate them or at least reduce their impact to acceptable levels. These assessments&#13;
and proposals will relate principally to vehicle emissions, vehicle noise, and visual intrusion.&#13;
2.34         To ensure that environmental impacts are properly evaluated and adequate mitigating&#13;
measures are proposed, CBTU's Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would hire a firm of experienced&#13;
professionals in resettlement as well as have environmental specialists in charge of reviewing and&#13;
monitoring all phases of project preparation and implementation. CBTU has accumulated considerable&#13;
experience with land expropriation during the construction of the existing line. More specifically, these&#13;
divisions would: (a) ensure that terms of reference (TOR) for feasibility studies include a preliminary&#13;
environmental impact evaluation or screening of the proposed solutions; (b) review the feasibility&#13;
studies and determine, according to good environmental practices, whether a specific and detailed&#13;
environmental impact assessment and development of mitigation measures, such as a relocation plan,&#13;
are required; (c) hire consultants to carry out appropriate analyses and propose mitigation measures;&#13;
(d) in the latter case, seek the Bank's approval for the proposed measures; (e) include the proposed&#13;
measures in the TOR for final engineering design, review the final engineering design from an&#13;
environmental standpoint, and clear the project for implementation; and (f) supervise the&#13;
implementation of the project to ensure that the participating operating agencies carry it out in&#13;
accordance with the design approved by CBTU. Since all the project designs will be financed and&#13;
approved by CBTU, it is expected that this arrangement will ensure that subcomponents are carried&#13;
out according to environmental practices acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
J2. Population Relocation&#13;
2.35         This project has been rated "B" by the Bank for environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
purposes. As such, only selective evaluation and proposals for mitigation of environmentally or socially&#13;
relevant impacts are required by the Bank for appraisal. However, in accordance with Brazilian&#13;
legislation, a full EA was prepared. TORs were developed by CBTU in consultation with the municipal&#13;
licensing agency (Secretaria Municipal do Meio Ambiente, SMMA). In fact, in Belo Horizonte the state&#13;
licensing agency (Fundacao Estadual do Meio Ambiente, FEAM) delegates the approval of&#13;
environmental impact statement to SMMA. The full extension of Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link (6.5 km, 8&#13;
stations) was analyzed by an independent consulting firm. CBTU has also hired an independent&#13;
resettlement and environmental assessment specialist to assist in project preparation.&#13;
2.36         CBTU is an experienced company and engineering designs are well advanced.&#13;
Preparation of assessments and the design of programs addressing environmental and social impacts&#13;
have only recently begun due to the requirements of the project cycle, which calls for these activities&#13;
to be carried out only after an expropriation decree is issued. This decree in turn depends on a precise&#13;
definition of the location and area requirements of all facilities.&#13;
2.37         At-grade or elevated structures will be used along the full extent of the line except for&#13;
approximately 225 meters of NATM tunnel, significantly reducing expropriation requirements and&#13;
environmental impacts as compared to traditional cut-and-cover methods. Stations have similarly been&#13;
designed with special attention to reducing expropriation requirements and to blend them with the&#13;
surrounding environment. Locations (i.e., buildings and plots) which need to be acquired to implement&#13;
the Bank-financed segment are at this point clearly identified. Table 2.4 summarizes their distribution&#13;
by site and use.&#13;

2.38         Whereas the initial layout at-grade called for acquisition of more buildings and plots,&#13;
alternative sites, designs and a tunnel of 225 meters were sought in an attempt to minimize public&#13;
acquisition. The current proposal has clearly managed to minimize project impact. Of the 406 locations&#13;
to be expropriated, 84 are middle-to-low income houses, 292 are favela houses, 30 are small shops,&#13;
and 12 are vacant lots. The total affected population is estimated to be under 1,880 people.&#13;
2.39         CBTU's usual practice in the case of middle-income residences is to expropriate at&#13;
market value, which is established according to criteria defined by ABNT (Associapao Brasileira de&#13;
Normas Tdcnicas) in accordance with local real estate transactions. The CBTU's Civil Works&#13;
Department follows a standard set of internal procedures, comprising preparation of a physical&#13;
cadastre, calculation of the asset's value, and presentation of CBTU's purchase proposal to the&#13;
proprietor. The Legal Department carries out the purchase if the stipulated price is accepted by the&#13;
proprietor, or takes the case to court if an agreement is not reached. Over the past 20 years, CBTU&#13;
has carried out over 5,000 expropriations. In roughly 70 percent of these, the proposed buying price&#13;
was accepted. The adequacy of compensation at market value is not difficult to establish since&#13;
monitoring and evaluation studies to verify how the affected population relocated were carried out for&#13;
the line which is in operation. In case of 'favela' houses, the practice adopted is either to resettle the&#13;
affected population to houses which are equal or better than the ones expropriated-preferably to sites&#13;
which are close to the ones being affected-or to offer a financial compensation for those families&#13;
which prefer to receive money instead of being relocated. The company also provides, in the case of&#13;
low-income families, assistance in finding replacement housing, logistical support for moving, legal&#13;
support to regularize property titles, relocation grants and other services. The total amount for&#13;
resettlement and expropriation was estimated at US$5.1 million. This amount was included in the&#13;
project costs and will be fully financed by the GOB.&#13;
2.40         An Environmental Assessment Report was prepared in April 1995 according to Bank&#13;
Guidelines, including a detailed relocation plan wherever it is applicable, and has been approved by the&#13;
Bank. To prepare the report: (a) a meeting with residents was held to present and discuss project&#13;
characteristics, expropriation requirements and other relevant impacts, expropriation procedures and&#13;
timing, proposed valuation criteria and other forms of compensation and assistance (see para. (d)&#13;
below); (b) minutes of the meeting were sent to the Bank; (c) the exact number and socio-economic&#13;
profile of affected families was determined; (d) a clear policy statement pertaining to the concession&#13;
of other grants and services which CBTU will make available to the affected population was completed;&#13;
(e) the final version of the expropriation program, including compensation and mitigation actions,&#13;
institutional matrix, chronogram, budget, funding arrangements, reflecting agreements reached with&#13;
the affected population, was made available prior to negotiations; and (f) a monitoring and evaluation&#13;
program was also presented prior to negotiations, to be carried out until the conclusion of the&#13;
relocation process of all households. Evidence that the State licensing agency has approved the&#13;
environmental impact statement and has issued the license to build the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link is a&#13;
condition of loan disbursement.&#13;

K. Private Sector Participation&#13;
2.41         To examine the financial instruments which can encourage private participation in the&#13;
construction and operation of selected parts of the mass transit systems, CBTU has created a high-&#13;
level working group of entrepreneurs and financiers. Many aspects of this program appear to be&#13;
appropriate for private or joint public/private development, which could result in considerable savings.&#13;
Station development is the most obvious, but consideration should also be given to leasing of some&#13;
existing stations and transfer points for private sector development and operation. Disposition of&#13;
excess railway land, and air rights would also be explored. CBTU has invited a high-level group&#13;
including respected outsiders such as elected officials, investment bankers, prominent developers, civil&#13;
works contractors and Chamber of Commerce representatives, to explore this as well as other ways&#13;
to 'capture" some of the added value of railway real estate development and prepare proposals for&#13;
inclusion in the program.&#13;
2.42         It was agreed between CBTU and the Bank that to foster the participation of the private&#13;
sector in the system, the Shareholders' Agreements will contain a clause which will require that the&#13;
State shall cause the MG Entity to offer to the private sector through at least four invitations to bid,&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, the exploitation of trains, station space, aerial space, parking areas, automatic&#13;
ticket collection, and other areas. The first bid should be launched not later than one year after the&#13;
transfer of STU-BH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
3.1          The Government of Brazil will be the Borrower. CBTU will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the project, in accordance with: (a) contractual arrangements; (b) the implementation&#13;
schedule; (c) implementation arrangements; (d) the decentralization implementation process; (e)&#13;
procurement arrangements; (f) disbursement arrangements; (g) auditing arrangements; and (h)&#13;
monitoring and reporting arrangements. These arrangements were confirmed during negotiations, and&#13;
detailed guidelines, satisfactory to the Bank, were prepared by CBTU. The Bank will monitor the&#13;
implementation of the project in accordance with a monitoring and supervision plan (Annex 1 1).&#13;
3.2          The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project will rest with the CBTU&#13;
which has established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) supported by consultants. CBTU and the&#13;
State agreed that the PIU will continue to manage the execution of the project after the transfer of the&#13;
STU-BH system to the State. This will ensure the continuity of project management experience&#13;
acquired with the ongoing CBTU-SP and CBTU-RJ projects and will prevent delays which could occur&#13;
due a change of the project implementation team before the conclusion of the project. To manage and&#13;
guide the "non-hardware" aspects (political, legal, administrative, institutional, and so forth) through&#13;
the transition and until December 1 996, an intergovernmental General Coordination Committee will&#13;
coordinate the work of a number of task forces, which will carry out strategic studies on terms of&#13;
reference agreed with the Bank during negotiations.&#13;
B. Contractual Arrangements&#13;
3.3         In order to ensure a smooth transition to decentralization, (the formal legal transfer and&#13;
start of operations by the SMG Operating Corporation), and to support its subsequent consolidation,&#13;
the following legal arrangements will apply:&#13;
With the Bank:&#13;
Bank and GOB        (Borrower)                        Loan Agreement&#13;
Bank and CBTU       (Executing Agency)                Project Agreement&#13;
Bank and SMG/MBH    (State of SMG &amp; Municipality of BH)  Shareholders' Agreements&#13;
Between Governments and agencies:&#13;
GOB and SMG        (Convenio Basico and Termos Aditivos)&#13;
CBTU and MG Entity (Decentralization Contract)&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
3.4          The implementation of this project has been tentatively scheduled over a six-year period&#13;
(1995-2001). The project would start on July 1, 1995 and be completed by June 30, 2001, with a&#13;
closing date of December 31, 2001. The Bank has recommended that STU-BH should take special care&#13;
in finalizing the project implementation schedule, which is directly linked to the procurement process,&#13;
and indicated that according to the Bank's experience, the bidding process for each bid may take from&#13;
7 to 1 2 months, including the approval of bidding documents, advertisement in Development Business&#13;
and local press, bid evaluation, recommendations for award, contract signature, and contract&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
D. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.5          Project Implementation Unit. CBTU will establish and maintain a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU) headed by a Project Coordinator to manage the implementation of the several components&#13;
of the Bank project. The Project Coordinator would report directly to CBTU's President. Project&#13;
Management and implementation consultants financed under Part A of the project would act as full-&#13;
time advisers to the Project Coordinator to provide the technical support and cross-country experience&#13;
required for managing the project. These consultants should be hired immediately after pre-appraisal.&#13;
In addition to the Project Coordinator who will be responsible for the overall financial management of&#13;
the project, the PIU will include: (a) a transport economist and policy studies coordinator responsible&#13;
for overseeing the execution of all the studies and transport economics aspects of Parts B and C of&#13;
the project; (b) an engineer, with experience in procurement, to coordinate Part A of the project; (c)&#13;
a management information systems specialist responsible for the reporting and supervision of the&#13;
project; and (d) a resettlement specialist. The PIU will be supported by a small secretariat which will&#13;
include an accountant responsible for project accounts and disbursements.&#13;
3.6          MG Entity's Project Management Unit. This Project Management Unit (MGE/PMU) will&#13;
be the counterpart of the PIU in STU-BH, and will follow closely the procurement, implementation and&#13;
supervision of the STU-BH's related works and acquisition of goods and coordinate system operation.&#13;
E. Decentralization Process&#13;
3.7          The transfer of the STU-BH subdivision from the GOB to the State of Minas Gerais and&#13;
the Municipality of Belo Horizonte has been agreed through the execution of an Agreement of Intent&#13;
(Convenio Basico) on June 1, 1995.&#13;
3.8          Transitional Phase to Decentralization. As the successful decentralization transfer will&#13;
be subject to detailed negotiations, and will involve some political considerations in addition to financial&#13;
and technical issues, the detailed steps and transition to decentralization are viewed as a dynamic&#13;
process involving the full and transparent participation of all levels of government. In order to support&#13;
this process, joint and parallel strategic studies, administrative and legal actions, organizational&#13;
changes, and key political decisions will have to be undertaken in a logical and sequential manner, and&#13;
synchronized with the timetable for processing and executing the proposed Bank Loan and eventually&#13;
for transfer of the system to SMG and MBH not later than the target date of December 31, 1996. The&#13;
following steps should be included:&#13;
(a)   General Coordination and Completion of Strategic Studies. Immediately&#13;
following the signing of the Convenio Basico, the General Coordination&#13;
Committee (CG) will manage and guide the decentralization process. The CG&#13;
will incorporate a number of task forces. The CG, with representatives from the&#13;
CBTU, SMG and MBH, will report to the Conselho Director through the&#13;
Representantes Executivos. The task forces will work on the strategic studies&#13;
and Actions Plans outlined in the Convenio Basico.&#13;
(b)   Transfer to Public Corporation. In accordance with the Federal Government's&#13;
policy for modernization of the economy, and SMG and MBH's long-standing&#13;
tradition for efficiency, the STU-BH will be transferred to a Public Corporation&#13;
(Sociedade Anonima de Economia Mista) called the MG Entity. Assurances&#13;
were sought at negotiations that not later than June 30, 1 996 SMG and MBH&#13;
would set up such Public Corporation, under an independent Board and&#13;
management autonomy, and thereafter, not later than December 31, 1996, the&#13;
STU-BH will be fully transferred to the Corporation. The articles of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
incorporation would include, among other things, that: (i) the Corporation will&#13;
be managed by professionally-trained Chief Executive Officers; (ii) the&#13;
management will adhere to specific operating financial and performance targets&#13;
set forth in annual contract plans; (iii) management will abide by agreed&#13;
personnel and administrative policies; and (iv) the Corporation will follow sound&#13;
commercial practices. Draft Articles of the Corporation will be reviewed by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
3.9          Timetable and Phasing for Decentralization. The project has been prepared to take into&#13;
account the Federal Government's objective to complete the legal and institutional transfer&#13;
(Decentralization) of the STU-BH by the target date of December 31, 1996, or when 60 percent of the&#13;
loan funds have been disbursed, whichever date is earlier, although the proposed project is expected&#13;
to continue until 2001. The term "transfer" means the transfer of ownership and operational&#13;
responsibilities of the STU-BH System to the MG Entity including the enactment and execution of all&#13;
legal, contractual and administrative acts and documents required under the legislation of the Borrower&#13;
and the State for these purposes.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.10         All project components financed under the proposed Bank loan would be procured in&#13;
accordance with Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995).&#13;
3.11         Procurement procedures would be as follows:&#13;
(a)   contracts for goods estimated to cost more than US$350,000 equivalent, and&#13;
contracts for works including civil works, systems, permanent way and rolling&#13;
stock, estimated to cost more than US$5.0 million equivalent, would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. In ICB&#13;
procurement of goods, domestic manufacturers may be granted a margin of&#13;
preference by adding 1 5 percent (or the applicable custom duties, whichever&#13;
is lower) to the CIF value of the foreign bids.2' The procurement of some&#13;
goods valued below US$350,000 could be through National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$0.5 million;&#13;
(b)   works of US$5.0 million equivalent or less, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$17.6 million (Table 3.1) would be awarded through NCB procedures and&#13;
foreign bidders would have the opportunity to compete. In addition: (i) project&#13;
components such as, civil works and systems, permanent way, and rolling&#13;
stock have been packaged and would be procured under supply and installation&#13;
procedures; and (ii) pre-qualification procedures would be followed for the&#13;
procurement of the signaling component; and&#13;
(c)   consultants, which are expected to aggregate to about US$14.7 million&#13;
(including supervision of investment under the project), would be selected and&#13;
engaged following the Bank's Guidelines for the use of Consultants (August&#13;
1981) and using the Bank's standard contract form for complex assignments.&#13;
3/    A local bidder is a Brazilian firm (or a consortium) offering goods containing components manufactured in Brazil that&#13;
represent at least 50 percent of the value of the goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.12           All procurement aspects were confirmed during negotiations, in particular the use of:&#13;
(a) standard bidding documents for NCB procedures for the procurement of goods or civil works&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) standard contract forms for consulting services issued by the Bank&#13;
for complex, time-based consulting assignments. The procurement schedule for major contracts is&#13;
shown in Annex 8, Table 8.5.&#13;
3.1 3          Procurement Review. All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$350,000 or more, and all contracts for works estimated to cost US$5.0 million or more, would&#13;
be subject to the Bank's prior review of the procurement documentation (advertising, bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation and contract award). The total value of these contracts would be US$136.7&#13;
million or about 83 percent of all Bank-financed goods and civil works. The procurement thresholds&#13;
are summarized in Table 3.2. CBTU's management has the capabilities to handle adequately the&#13;
procurement processes required for this project. Procurement information would be recorded as&#13;
follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award by the borrower; and (b) comprehensive biannual&#13;
reports to the Bank by the borrowers, indicating: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and&#13;
the total project, including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies; (ii)&#13;
revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract awards, and completion&#13;
time for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of&#13;
procurement.&#13;

G. Disbursement and Special Account&#13;
3.14         All disbursements under contracts of less than US$5.0 million equivalent for works,&#13;
such as systems, permanent way and assembly of rolling stock, and of less than US$350,000&#13;
equivalent for goods would be made on the basis of certified statements of expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
prepared by CBTU. SOE limits for consultant service contracts will be US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals. Supporting documentation for the SOEs would be retained by CBTU and&#13;
made available for examination by Bank staff during supervision missions. To expedite project&#13;
execution, a Special Account would be opened in a commercial bank under terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank with an authorized allocation of up to US$6.0 million equivalent. This account&#13;
will be replenished for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures. Authorization&#13;
is sought for retroactive financing of up to US$9.9 million equivalent (10 percent of loan funds) in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's standard guidelines. This retroactive financing would be for expenditures&#13;
made after March 31, 1995, but no later than three months after loan effectiveness and cover items&#13;
such as the preparation of final engineering designs which must be carried out to complete the project&#13;
preparation (Annex 5). Claims for retroactive financing would have to be made no later three months&#13;
after loan effectiveness. The disbursement arrangements were discussed and agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations. Table 3.3 presents the percentage to be disbursed by loan category.&#13;

H. Auditing&#13;
3.15         CBTU would prepare financial statements, the Special Account audits, and SOEs audits&#13;
using external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would review the external auditors' terms&#13;
of reference. CBTU in turn, would require the MG Entity to engage external auditors satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank to audit their subproject accounts, which should be maintained separately. CBTU would review&#13;
the audits of the subprojects and report to the Bank on the status and any remedial actions taken, if&#13;
required. CBTU's and the SMG Entity's audit reports would be presented to the Bank no later than April&#13;
30 of each year. The project auditing arrangements were discussed and agreed during negotiations.&#13;
I. Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.1 6        Annual Review and Project Plan of Action. In November of each year, the Bank and the&#13;
SMG would conduct a formal joint review of the progress made in reaching the objectives and in the&#13;
implementation of the proposed project. The annual review would provide an opportunity to discuss&#13;
project issues, in particular:  compliance with covenants; technical assistance; institutional&#13;
development advancements and performance of CBTU; execution and analysis of further needs of the&#13;
training program; the quality of subproject implementation, including environmental analyses;&#13;
implementation of studies, sector policies and actions; and the implementation of a monitoring program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(proposed monitoring indicators are presented in Annex 11). The discussion and analysis of the issues&#13;
addressed during the year under review would lead to the formulation of adjustments and, if necessary,&#13;
remedial actions satisfactory to the Bank. The timing and scope of the annual review were confirmed&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;
3.17         The project places great emphasis on institutional development in the sector and as&#13;
such, implementation must be closely monitored and evaluated. It is proposed that a Mid-term Review&#13;
of the project be held 24 months after loan effectiveness. At the review, the performance of the&#13;
project would be assessed and the second period implementation program would be amended as&#13;
necessary based on the results of that evaluation.&#13;
3.18         Reporting. It was agreed during appraisal, and was confirmed at negotiations, that&#13;
CBTU with the assistance of participating operating agencies, would prepare biannual progress reports&#13;
on June 30 and December 31 of each year and submit them within 60 days. The reports would cover&#13;
past institutional development and project execution achievements and compare them with the&#13;
appraisal projections and goals set forth in the Action Plan (Annex 11). They would present a critical&#13;
assessment of problems and issues arising during project execution. The reports would also discuss&#13;
compliance with dated covenants and other conditions by each agency and actions taken to enforce&#13;
compliance. In cases of unsatisfactory progress, the reports would also describe proposals for&#13;
adjustments and remedial actions. The case for more periodic (quarterly) reporting would be reviewed&#13;
at the Mid-term Review. To facilitate adequate monitoring of the project, CBTU has agreed to install&#13;
no later than 90 days after loan signing a management information system to track the physical,&#13;
financial and environmental status of each component of the project.&#13;
J. Project Supervision&#13;
3.19         The responsibilities for supervising project implementation and a supervision plan are&#13;
shown in Annex 11. It is expected that at least three supervision missions per year staffed by an urban&#13;
transport engineer/planner, a railway engineer, a metro infrastructure engineer, and a financial&#13;
analyst/transport economist will be required to supervise the proposed project during the first three&#13;
years of execution. In addition, specialists in resettlement, traffic engineering, air quality and&#13;
procurement would accompany the supervision missions as required. Supervision requirements are&#13;
expected to be intensive, particularly in the initial years, as Bank missions would aim to visit every&#13;
operating agency at least once a year. For the first three years, the supervision requirements are&#13;
estimated at about 1 5 staff weeks, reducing to 13 staff weeks in the fourth year, and 1 2 staff weeks&#13;
in the fifth, sixth and seventh years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. PROJECT AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
4.1   The following Project Management assurances were obtained at appraisal and confirmed at&#13;
negotiations:&#13;
(a)   that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be structured and adequately staffed and&#13;
otherwise supported in the implementation of its responsibility under the project. CBTU&#13;
provided the Bank with the names and curricula vitae of the staff assigned to the PIU&#13;
(para. 3.5);&#13;
(b)   that procurement will be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines, including: (i)&#13;
the use of standard bidding documents for the procurement of goods and works, under&#13;
NCB and ICB procedures; (ii) use of Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants;&#13;
and (iii) the procurement limits (para. 3.11);&#13;
(c)   that a Special Account in a commercial bank will be opened and maintained (para.&#13;
3.14);&#13;
(d)   that the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures (SOEs): (a) will be audited&#13;

with good environmental practices (para. 2.31); and&#13;
(g)   that the Environmental Assessment for the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link be submitted to&#13;
the Bank and State and Municipal Authorities (para. 2.35).&#13;
4.2    The Conv&amp;nio Basico satisfactory to the Bank and completion of final engineering and technical&#13;
specifications of works and goods for the first year of the program were submitted to the Bank for&#13;
review during negotiations.&#13;
4.3   The following is a Condition of Loan Effectiveness: the registration of the Loan Agreement by&#13;
the Central Bank.&#13;
4.4    The following is a Condition of Disbursement for the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link: the approval&#13;
by the State and Municipal environmental authorities of the Environmental Assessment of the Sao&#13;
Paulo - Vilarinho link and the granting of the necessary licenses for the works (para. 2.40);&#13;
4.5    Dated covenants to be included in the Legal Agreements are:&#13;
(a)   Decentralization and Operational Efficiency:&#13;
(i)   that the transfer of STU-BH will be completed by the target date of December&#13;
31, 1996 or when 60 percent of the loan funds have been disbursed,&#13;
whichever date is earlier, in accordance with a phased program previously&#13;
agreed with the Bank (para. 3.9);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
lii)  that not later than June 30, 1996 SMG and MBH establish or designate a&#13;
juridically independent public corporation (the MG Entity) with sufficient powers&#13;
and authority to accept the transfer of STU-BH and to own and operate all&#13;
assets included therein. That SMG and MBH not later than December 1 5 each&#13;
year after the transfer and until December 1 5, 2001 execute agreements with&#13;
the MG Entity, satisfactory to the Bank (the Contract Plans), including specific&#13;
performance targets for the following fiscal year and the financial contributions&#13;
and other actions required from the State to enable the MG Entity to attain&#13;
such targets (para. 3.8); and&#13;
(iii)  that CBTU will actively pursue actions to meet the agreed basic performance&#13;
targets until the transfer of STU-BH and cooperate with the MG Entity&#13;
thereafter to achieve the targets agreed until the end of the project by ensuring&#13;
that implementation of the project is on schedule (para. 3.18).&#13;
(b)   Financial Policy and Modal Integration:&#13;
(i}   that prior to the transfer of STU-BH to the State, the GOB will be responsible&#13;
for the cost of capital investments plus debt service (interest and amortization)&#13;
of the STU-BH incurred before the transfer and the costs of the proposed loan&#13;
(para. 2.20);&#13;
(ii)  that during the period up to December 31, 1996, the GOB: (i) will cover the&#13;
difference between the working costs and operating revenues of the STU-BH;&#13;
and (ii) that after the transfer is effected, the GOB operating subsidy (shortfall&#13;
between operating revenues and working expenses) to the MG Entity will be&#13;
discontinued (para. 2.20);&#13;
(iii)  that the CBTU, SMG and MBH undertake to ensure completion of the financing&#13;
mechanisms study (under terms of reference approved by the Bank) at least&#13;
one month before the Mid-term Project Review, so that an Action Plan on the&#13;
agreed recommendations can be prepared (para. 2.19);&#13;
(iv)  that not later than 1 2 months from the date of signing of the Loan Agreement,&#13;
SMG and MBH will present a plan (financial, technical and institutional) and a&#13;
timetable, satisfactory to the Bank, for the transfer, integration and&#13;
consolidation of the municipal and metropolitan bus system with the STU-BH&#13;
(para. 2.1 1); and that SMG and MBH will be responsible for implementing this&#13;
integration plan not later than 30 days after the entry in operation of each link&#13;
of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho line; and&#13;
(v)   that SMG and MBH will create a Regional Transport Coordination Commission&#13;
not later than one year after loan effectiveness (para. 1.13).&#13;
(c)   that a Mid-term Project Review will take place 24 months after project effectiveness&#13;
to review pre-agreed institutional, operational and financial performance indicators, and&#13;
compliance with covenants (including tariffs, subsidies, and progress on studies) of the&#13;
Loan and Project Agreements to assess project performance and progress on&#13;
decentralization, and as necessary, agree on remedial actions. Particular importance will&#13;
be given, during the Mid-term Review, to the agreed working ratios and the status of&#13;
the studies and action plans required to ensure a smooth transfer of STU-BH (para.&#13;
3.17); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
(d)    Private Sector Participation: the State shall cause the MG Entity to offer to the private&#13;
sector, through at least four invitations to bid, satisfactory to the Bank, the exploitation&#13;
of trains, station space, aerial space above stations, parking terminals, automatic fare&#13;
collection and other investments. The first bid should be launched not later than one&#13;
year after the transfer of STU-BH (para. 2.42).&#13;
4.6    Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing of up to US$9.9 million equivalent (10 percent of&#13;
loan funds) for expenditures made after March 31, 1995 (but no later than three months after loan&#13;
effectiveness) is recommended because certain project activities, such as preparation of final&#13;
engineering designs, will have to be undertaken immediately.&#13;
4.7    Recommendation. With the above Agreements and Conditions, the proposed project would be&#13;
suitable for a Bank loan of US$99 million equivalent, to be repaid in 1 5 years, at the Bank's standard&#13;
variable rate, with a grace period of five years and loan amortization based on level repayments of&#13;
principal.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR IN BRAZIL&#13;
AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.           This Annex outlines the Bank's past support for the Brazilian urban transport sector and&#13;
the experience gained. The lessons learned can be summarized as: (a) the coordination between the&#13;
three levels of government in urban transport should be dealt with very carefully at the project&#13;
preparation level and reviewed in detail during the Mid-term Project Review; (b) policy for the sector&#13;
should be strengthened to minimize distortions resulting from inefficient physical and financial&#13;
coordination between modes and to promote multi-modal integration; (c) the tariff levels should allow&#13;
for significant cost recovery of working costs and should be complemented by financing mechanisms&#13;
which cover the shortfall; (d) demand levels are often overestimated and should therefore be carefully&#13;
scrutinized; and (e) more attention should be given to the management of infrastructure maintenance.&#13;
A. First Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1563-BR. US$88 million, May 1978)&#13;
2.           Project Objectives. The objectives were to: (a) finance investments that would improve&#13;
urban transport services, with emphasis on the provision of public transport, especially to the poor;&#13;
(b) promote and support the development and implementation of appropriate urban transport policies;&#13;
and (c) strengthen municipal, state, and federal capacity to prepare, appraise, and execute sound urban&#13;
transport projects.&#13;
3.           Project Content. The project was broad in scope and included traffic engineering and&#13;
management measures in central urban areas and at critical points, the introduction of exclusive bus&#13;
lanes and segregated busways, widening of critical links, or construction of missing links in the road&#13;
network, reorganization or construction of bus terminals, paving of bus routes in low-income areas,&#13;
and training, technical assistance and institutional strengthening to improve the delivery of transport&#13;
services. Project beneficiaries included five metropolitan regions (Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre,&#13;
Belo Horizonte and Salvador). Nine different agencies were involved in implementation and overall&#13;
coordination was the responsibility of the Brazilian Urban Transport Company (EBTU).&#13;
4.          Implementation Experience. The project experienced various delays due to: (a) lack of&#13;
institutional support to the cities from EBTU, and Government changes in 1 979 which led to staff&#13;
changes in the various implementing agencies; (b) the preparation of final engineering designs and&#13;
tendering; (c) land acquisition; (d) availability of counterpart funds; (e) local level coordination; and (f)&#13;
quality control of the works. The closing date for the project was extended twice, resulting in the&#13;
implementation period changing from three years to five years and nine months. This suggests that the&#13;
appraisal schedule estimate was overly optimistic. Even so, the implementation period was still&#13;
substantially shorter than both worldwide and LAC region profiles which were above eight years. The&#13;
only specific covenant not met was the one requiring the five municipalities to take the necessary steps&#13;
to revise the valuation for tax purposes of properties whose values had been affected by the project.&#13;
In the early stages of the project, EBTU staff were less forceful than expected in solving local problems&#13;
and bringing difficulties to the attention of decision-makers. It must be recognized, however, that EBTU&#13;
was in its formative stages. This was a first project for them and there was a learning process&#13;
involved. As part of this process, and in order to achieve institutional improvement, EBTU prepared&#13;
several operational manuals to assist in the appraisal and supervision processes. These manuals and&#13;
the experience gained by EBTU (and the Bank) provided the basis for the development procedures&#13;
applied in the Third Urban Transport Project (1981), which did much to improve the quality and&#13;
efficiency of EBTU's operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
5.           Results. The project was timely and helped to focus the Government's growing concern&#13;
about urban transport problems. The support given to the institutional development of EBTU, following&#13;
its creation in 1976, improved federal-level urban transport planning. The project was successful in&#13;
providing improved urban transport services, particularly public transport to serve the poor. The OED&#13;
concluded that "the project was successful in implementing some of the most imaginative and radical&#13;
bus priority measures carried out anywhere in the world. These experiences have relevance for Bank-&#13;
financed urban transport projects worldwide." The bus priority measures included the development of&#13;
the bus corridor concept. Bus corridors were designed to accommodate passenger demand levels which&#13;
were difficult to satisfy by conventional bus services. Schemes involved segregated busways&#13;
introduced into the existing road system, facilities for passengers and pedestrians, bus system&#13;
reorganization (usually trunk/feeder), traffic management measures and integrated bus fare systems.&#13;
The project was also generally successful in providing institutional support at the metropolitan region&#13;
(MR) level where there has been a significant improvement in the capacity of the agencies to tackle&#13;
urban transport issues. The success was most particularly noted in those cities in which plans for&#13;
future urban transport investments existed, not necessarily financed by the Bank, which provided the&#13;
scope for continued institutional support. Finally, the studies and institutional strengthening financed&#13;
under the project, coupled with the successful implementation of the physical components, have led&#13;
to policy changes affecting urban transport in Brazil as whole and, in particular, have resulted in&#13;
increased emphasis on public bus transport and greater attention to cost-effective policies of traffic&#13;
management.&#13;
6.           Sustainability. Institutional, technical and financial resources are required to sustain the&#13;
types of investments included in the First Urban Transport Project. Although there were some&#13;
institutional and technical weaknesses, the project clearly provided support to strengthen EBTU and&#13;
the local agencies. In the case of EBTU, this support was continued in the Third Urban Transport&#13;
Project. The major constraint with respect to sustainability has been the lack of provision for cost&#13;
recovery, or other funds to cover maintenance of the physical schemes implemented under the project.&#13;
The failure to make provision for maintenance of the investments is seen in practically all the city&#13;
projects.&#13;
7.           However, the project had a substantial institutional impact overall. It assisted EBTU at&#13;
a critical and formative stage of its development, by providing strong technical and financial support,&#13;
which enabled it to play a catalytic role in transport improvements in urban areas. EBTU subsequently&#13;
took increasing responsibility in the appraisal and supervision of Bank-financed urban transport projects,&#13;
a process which began with the five metropolitan regions included in the First Urban Transport Project,&#13;
and which culminated with full responsibility for appraisal and supervision of eleven of the fourteen&#13;
urban centers included in the Third Urban Transport Project.&#13;
8.           The institutional support resulting from the technical assistance and studies, coupled&#13;
with the experience gained generally from the successful implementation of the physical components&#13;
included in the First Urban Transport Project, have led to urban transport policy changes which affect&#13;
Brazil as a whole. These include more emphasis on traffic management, on the provision of public bus&#13;
transport, and on the functioning of coordinating bodies at the local level to implement urban transport&#13;
policy.&#13;
B. Second Urban Transport (Porto Alegre) Project (Ln. 1839-BR, US$159 million, June 1980)&#13;
9.           Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to establish a new company to own,&#13;
manage, and operate a suburban rail mass transit system on a commercial basis without operating&#13;
subsidies; (b) to achieve a significantly more efficient modal distribution of traffic and use of all&#13;
transport facilities in the metropolitan region's North-South corridor; and Ic) to promote the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
development of selected employment growth poles in the North-South corridor near urban railway&#13;
stations.&#13;
10.          Project Content. The project consisted of the construction of a surface suburban rail&#13;
mass transit system using electric unit trains between the central business area in Porto Alegre and&#13;
the municipality of Sapucaia, 26.7 km to the north, the establishment of a new company to own,&#13;
manage and operate this service, and a complementary program of policies and studies.&#13;
11.          Implementation Experience. Despite some serious problems of procurement, passenger&#13;
services started in March 1 985, one year after the originally planned starting date. The railway&#13;
company, TRENSURB, was successfully established and during the course of project implementation&#13;
changed its nature from a construction organization to a railway operating company. The project&#13;
closing date was extended once by one year to December 31, 1986.&#13;
12.          Results. The Project Completion Report sums up well the principal lessons:&#13;
(a)   It is not sufficient that the railway service has been successfully implemented.&#13;
The success of the project depends upon the service attracting sufficient&#13;
passengers to make the investments economically viable and the railway profit-&#13;
able. This will be highly contingent upon the resumption of economic growth&#13;
in Porto Alegre and in the evolution of the fares for the users of alternative&#13;
transport modes. In addition, the attractiveness of the system would be&#13;
enhanced by the implementation of the recommendations of the studies carried&#13;
out under the project (bus integration, car parking restrictions, etc.).&#13;
(b}   One major lesson to be learned from this project is that, in cases in which there&#13;
is a need for substantial policy decisions and the implementation of measures&#13;
involving different Government agencies subject to conflicting pressures, their&#13;
commitment should be realistically assessed during project preparation. The&#13;
steps to ensure that these policies are implemented on time should be carefully&#13;
identified at the same time. In the particular case of the Second Urban&#13;
Transport Project, a more detailed action program including specific policy&#13;
implementation targets and appropriate measures for its enforcement should&#13;
have been agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
(cl   Regarding the original objective of TRENSURB covering its working costs, the&#13;
appraisal was unrealistic to expect that this would take place during the initial&#13;
operation period. Only after the system has demonstrated its reliability to the&#13;
users, will the application of a revenue maximizing policy be feasible. In the&#13;
meantime, TRENSURB should review its staff needs in order to streamline costs&#13;
and carry out a tariff study to determine the optimal user charges. The Bank&#13;
should closely follow-up the implementation of these tasks in the context of its&#13;
ongoing and future involvement in the sector and continue to impress upon the&#13;
Government the benefits to be gained from a financially healthy public enter-&#13;
prise as well as the existence of tools much more effective than transport&#13;
subsidies to achieve income distribution objectives."&#13;
C. Third Urban Transport Project (Ln. 1965-BR, US$90 million, March 1981)&#13;
13.          Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) to improve the quality and efficiency of&#13;
EBTU's operations through changes in its structure, procedures, and staff allocation; (b) to improve&#13;
transport infrastructure and operations in 14 medium-sized cities and conurbations (AGLURB); and (c)&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -                              ANNEX 1&#13;
to pave bus routes in low-income areas in medium-sized cities, state capitals, and metropolitan regions&#13;
(termed PROPAV).&#13;
14.          Project Content. The project consisted of three subprojects: (a) the institutional&#13;
subproject included EBTU's reorganization, training, technical assistance and studies; (b) the AGLURB&#13;
subproject consisted of the establishment and operation of an urban transport management unit in each&#13;
of the 14 cities and various components in low-cost improvements to existing urban transport&#13;
infrastructure, with emphasis on public transport operations and improvements of planning and&#13;
operation of urban transport infrastructure and services at the local level; and (c) the PROPAV&#13;
subproject included the paving of about 850 km of bus routes in low-income areas.&#13;
1 5.        Implementation Experience. Project implementation delays were experienced as a result&#13;
of numerous political changes, limited counterpart funds, the transfer of EBTU to the Minist6rio de&#13;
Desenvolvimento Urbano (MDU) from the Ministerio dos Transportes (MT) and, soon thereafter, the&#13;
Federal Government's Economic Package, which delayed the signing of the 1 986 Convenios by about&#13;
six months. The project was amended twice, which included the addition of four cities to the AGLURB&#13;
subproject and of 350 km of bus routes in low-income areas to the PROPAV subproject, and resulted&#13;
also in an extension in the implementation period from four years and three months to five years and&#13;
nine months. EBTU was in compliance with all loan covenants.&#13;
1 6.         Results. The AGLURB subproject has done much to create a realistic and effective&#13;
transport planning environment in Brazilian medium-sized conurbations. The design of the physical&#13;
components drew heavily on the successful experience of the First Urban Transport Project. Emphasis&#13;
of the project was placed on cost-effective, traffic management-based schemes in which assistance&#13;
to public transport (buses) has been the primary objective in the majority of components. The&#13;
institutional development of the AGLURB areas was achieved through the establishment of&#13;
management units specifically to coordinate project implementation. Transport companies were formed&#13;
to coordinate transport planning and operation. Retention of the management units would depend on&#13;
decisions by individual cities, but selected personnel would be transferred from the management units&#13;
to the transport companies. At the time of project completion, the implementation delays arising from&#13;
the political, financial, and organizational factors meant that comprehensive ex-post evaluations were&#13;
not yet available. As with the First Urban Transport Project, there is a risk that the institutional gains&#13;
may not be sustained unless a flow of funds is made available to AGLURB cities to continue purposeful&#13;
transport planning.&#13;
1 7.         The PROPAV program   was innovative and was a significant step in EBTU's&#13;
development. PROPAV was essentially a subsectoral component and EBTU was responsible for all&#13;
aspects of the program. The program utilized local materials and labor-intensive construction methods&#13;
to the maximum practical extent, with the result that the costs were initially overestimated. This&#13;
permitted a greater than targeted program to be undertaken, and to date all 850 km of paving have&#13;
been implemented. The PROPAV program is regarded as a highly successful program. To an extent,&#13;
the success of the program is demonstrated by the fact that similar paving programs have been&#13;
undertaken in other countries in Latin America.&#13;
1 8.         The institutional strengthening comprised two main aspects: (a) EBTU reorganization;&#13;
and (b) training and studies. The reorganization of EBTU proposed under the Third Project was&#13;
completed in 1 984. In general, the reorganization was judged to have increased EBTU's effectiveness.&#13;
However, with the changing demands arising from federal government policy on decentralization and&#13;
from the needs of the Fourth Urban Transport Project, additional changes were considered necessary.&#13;
1 9.         The training program comprised a conventional approach (of courses, seminars, etc.)&#13;
to transport planners and an imaginative training program for bus operators and personnel. The latter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -                              ANNEX 1&#13;
program has been successful in lowering bus operating costs, reducing accidents, and improving public&#13;
acceptability for bus services.&#13;
20.          The general delays in project implementation affected the commencement of the studies&#13;
proposed for inclusion in the project. Furthermore, EBTU did not initially give high priority to the&#13;
studies. However, in the last year of the project, the study program was revised and additionally&#13;
provided inputs to the preparation of the Fourth Urban Transport project. In particular, the Financial&#13;
Study enabled EBTU to form a policy for on-lending, the vehicle operating cost study (carried out by&#13;
GEIPOT) provided data for incorporation in the EBTU Operations Manual (OM), and the bus information&#13;
system program (SITURB) furnished an initial data base for evaluating bus operating costs.&#13;
D. Fourth Urban Transport Project (Ln. 2822-BR, US$200 million, May 1987)&#13;
21.          Project Objectives. The objectives were: (a) improve the operating efficiency of the&#13;
urban transport systems in the nine metropolitan regions (MRs) through savings in transport costs and&#13;
time; (b) seek to pass savings from improvements in the urban transport systems on to users, many&#13;
of whom were among the urban poor, in the form of lower tariffs and/or improved levels of service;&#13;
(c} conserve energy and encourage substitution of diesel fuel by promotion of domestic energy sources,&#13;
wherever economically justified; (d) strengthen the role of financial aspects in urban transport policy;&#13;
(e) strengthen the major institutions, in particular for coordinated investment planning for the sector&#13;
as a whole; and (f) increase the responsiveness of transport planning to local needs.&#13;
22.          Project Content. The proposed project would have financed components selected from&#13;
EBTU's rolling urban transport investment plan (1986-1 990) in Brazil's nine MRs (Belo Horizonte,&#13;
Belem, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Sao Paulo). Components&#13;
would include a Corridor Program, comprising investments, including design and supervision, to&#13;
improve public transportation (mainly bus systems, but also some trolley bus and ferry systems) and&#13;
to correct weaknesses in road networks. The Corridor Program would include infrastructure (including&#13;
extensive rehabilitation and reconstruction), traffic management measures and supporting&#13;
organizational improvements; and a system-wide Maintenance Program, including civil works,&#13;
equipment, the establishment of maintenance management systems, and institutional strengthening.&#13;
The project would also finance a sector-wide Institutional Program which would involve EBTU, MRs,&#13;
MDU, and CBTU. This component would include technical assistance and training for improved&#13;
planning and operational practices, studies and organizational measures to strengthen and improve&#13;
sector coordination, financial planning and urban transport policy development and pilot technological&#13;
development programs.&#13;
23.          Results. There was a considerable delay in declaring the project effective. Institutional&#13;
problems at the level of the Federal Government resulted in a very poor environment for the project's&#13;
implementation. The Fourth Urban Transport Project was canceled when the EBTU was abolished by&#13;
the Government in 1989.&#13;
E. S3o Paulo Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3457-BR, US$126 million,&#13;
September 1992)&#13;
24.          This project was signed in September 1 992, became effective in February 1 993, and&#13;
its closing date is June 30, 1 996. The project is underway and several major institutional hurdles, such&#13;
as a federal law to transfer the assets of the railway from the Federal to the State, have been&#13;
overcome. The rehabilitation of CBTU-SP, the Sao Paulo subdivision of the CBTU, is underway. Sao&#13;
Paulo established a new company (CPTM) to take over the decentralized CBTU-SP and also the&#13;
FEPASA metropolitan train. So far, the main problems of the project have been associated with&#13;
problems at the Federal level, including delays in the opening of special accounts, and several changes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -                               ANNEX 1&#13;
in ministers and their immediate advisors. These constant changes delayed the signing of 'conv6nios'&#13;
which regulate the transfer of operations and assets. The actual takeover of CBTU by CPTM took place&#13;
on May 27, 1994. The project is now disbursing very well and some of the infrastructure and&#13;
equipment components have been completed. As of February 21, 1995, 68 percent of the total project&#13;
cost had been committed.&#13;
F. Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization Project (Ln. 3633-BR, US$128.5 million,&#13;
October 1993)&#13;
25.          This project was signed in October 1993 and became effective on March 14, 1993.&#13;
Most of the bids for track work and rolling stock rehabilitation are underway. The actual&#13;
decentralization which involves the takeover of CBTU-Rio de Janeiro by the State and of the Metro by&#13;
the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro took place on January 1, 1 995.&#13;
G. Conclusions and Lessons Learned&#13;
26.          Despite the considerable achievements of the First Urban Transport Project and the&#13;
success of the Third Urban Transport Project, the projects have led to the conclusion that several&#13;
specific issues in the urban transport sector require attention and should be addressed within the&#13;
context of overall sector reform. The main issues are discussed below.&#13;
27.          Cost Recovery. Direct cost recovery is difficult in the urban transport sector, other than&#13;
for self-financing infrastructure and passenger vehicles and vessels. Therefore, transportation&#13;
infrastructure investments (urban and interurban) conventionally recover costs indirectly through&#13;
transport-related taxes. In the First Urban Transport Project, it was envisaged that partial cost recovery&#13;
would take place by the revaluation of properties whose values were affected by the project. No such&#13;
revision in valuation, however, has apparently taken place in any of the five MRs, partly because of&#13;
the difficulties in assessing an increase in property values through the low-cost improvement schemes&#13;
provided under the project, when alternative policies or conditions encourage the provision of essential&#13;
municipal infrastructure, at little or no cost to the beneficiaries. In retrospect, the project should have&#13;
also addressed the indirect cost recovery mechanisms.&#13;
28.          Maintenance. Lack of maintenance is clearly a problem in each of the five MRs in the&#13;
First Project, and is now apparent in the components implemented early in the Third Urban Transport&#13;
Project. Problems apply to a wide range of components. Maintenance covenants were included in the&#13;
agreements for both projects, but this has proved an ineffective mechanism for ensuring adequate&#13;
maintenance levels. While there is increasing awareness of the problem and while improved&#13;
maintenance standards are an objective of the Federal Government, there is a need to develop an&#13;
institutional and financial framework and capability to provide the necessary funding and to carry out&#13;
the appropriate maintenance. In hindsight, this problem probably reflects the limitation of addressing&#13;
narrow sectoral issues, in isolation of a broader policy framework for the urban sector as a whole.&#13;
29.          Bus Regulation. There has been a trend in some cities toward the creation of integrated&#13;
bus systems, controlled and regulated by a central, public authority. The central authority plans the&#13;
system and contracts with operators to provide services according to standard cost schedules. "Excess&#13;
revenue" is taken from operators on profitable routes to cross subsidize those operating unprofitable&#13;
routes. The feeder/trunk concept may make this increased regulation easier to achieve. There are&#13;
several areas of concern. First, there are signs that the determination by the central authority of all&#13;
operating parameters is tending to lead to standardized solutions which may stifle innovation and&#13;
reduce passenger choice. Secondly, the contribution of the private sector is limited. Thirdly, the needs&#13;
of the passenger do not always receive adequate attention; for example, feeder/trunk systems force&#13;
passengers to change buses and in cases where full integration has not been achieved, passengers can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-                                  ANNEX 1&#13;
be worse off since they have to pay twice and are further inconvenienced by the change. A thorough&#13;
review of the regulatory framework is urgently required, to ensure improved accessibility, greater&#13;
equity and efficiency, and a stronger role for private sector operators of public transport.&#13;
H. Lessons Learned and the Proposed Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Transport Decentralization&#13;
Project&#13;
30.          The proposed urban transport project is the seventh to be considered in Brazil. Thus,&#13;
there is considerable "in-country" experience to draw upon. In addition, the design of the proposed&#13;
project has attempted to recognize the findings and experience from similar projects outlined in this&#13;
Annex. The main features of the proposed project which respond to the lessons learned are described&#13;
in the following paragraphs.&#13;
31.           Institutions. A successful institutional arrangement will be the key to project success&#13;
and project sustainability. In the past in Brazil, there has been little incentive for cities/municipalities&#13;
to undertake cost-effective transport planning and investment. Cities have been starved of resources&#13;
for transport investment. The creation of the Belo Horizonte Regional Transport Coordination&#13;
Commission (RTCC) will be a major advance. In addition to insuring that major projects are in line with&#13;
an approved integrated air quality, land use and urban transport strategy, RTCC's key role will be to&#13;
facilitate service and tariff integration between the several modes. It is expected that no urban&#13;
transport project in the BHMR will be considered in the future by the Bank without prior approval by&#13;
the RTCC.&#13;
32.          To further support the long-term development of traffic and transport planning, the&#13;
project will include funding for the preparation of an Integrated Air Quality, Land Use and Urban&#13;
Transport strategy and the updating of the metropolitan data base. Staff from participating&#13;
implementing agencies will benefit from this work.&#13;
33.           Counterpart Funding. In Brazil, lack of timely counterpart funding is often the main&#13;
cause of delays in project implementation. Several steps were taken to mitigate this problem. The&#13;
Governor, as a condition of negotiations, will indicate in writing that in case of scarcity of counterpart&#13;
funds the proposed project will have priority over other transport projects. Although an analysis of the&#13;
State finances reveals that the sources of funds exist, the challenge will be to ensure that they are&#13;
available when the system is decentralized.&#13;
34.           Implementation Schedule. Long implementation, and thus slow disbursements, have&#13;
been problems in previous projects. This may be traced to:&#13;
(a)    Lack of familiarity of local staff with Bank procedures. A training program is proposed&#13;
but training programs take time for benefits to be realized and, even then, there is no&#13;
substitute for practical application. CBTU's PIU has gained considerable experience&#13;
with the ongoing Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Transport Decentralization&#13;
loans (Lns. 3457-BR and 3633-BR).&#13;
(b)    Uncertain political commitment. The establishment of the RTCC gives grounds for&#13;
confidence that all levels of government of the metropolitan region are committed to&#13;
the project. During preparation the level of support was excellent.&#13;
(c)    Lack of final engineering designs for physical works. It is proposed that participating&#13;
agencies should have the first year of final engineering designs (including bidding&#13;
documents) available at negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

35.          Environment. In the past, urban transport projects with the exception of the Mexico&#13;
Transport Air Quality Management Project (Ln. 3543-ME) and the Teheran Transport Emissions&#13;
Reduction Project (TF 028642-GET) have had few or no specific measures to improve air quality&#13;
project. The proposed project contains an Air Quality and Traffic Safety component which together&#13;
with the infrastructure components is expected to set the foundation for further development in these&#13;
areas in the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region.&#13;

PROJECT COORDINATION AND EXECUTING AGENCIES&#13;
1.           The overall coordination and supervision of the proposed project rests with the CBTU&#13;
which has established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). To assist CBTU to carry out its obligations,&#13;
the PIU will be supported by a Project Management and Implementation Consultant (PMIC). CBTU will&#13;
be the implementing agency for all components but will be helped in some cases by the State/Municipal&#13;
Agency in charge of the specific area addressed by the component.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
REGIONAL TRANSPORT COORDINATION COMMISSION&#13;
A. The Establishment and Role of a Regional Transport Coordination Commission (RTCC)&#13;
1.           To facilitate coordination of investment and operation among the major providers of&#13;
urban transport services, the proposal to create a regional coordinating body is being given priority.&#13;
This would not be a new level of government and would not usurp the powers of the State or the&#13;
Municipality. It would provide a forum, however, to formally review all proposals with respect to their&#13;
compliance with an agreed-upon transport strategy, evaluate alternatives, and make recommendations&#13;
based on a regional, intermodal point of view. The RTCC will include representatives of the Governor&#13;
of the State and Mayors of the BHMR, in particular the Mayor of the Belo Horizonte Municipality, as&#13;
well as DEMETR6, BHTRANS, DER-MG, DETRAN and bus operator associations and those agencies&#13;
responsible for municipal and regional planning. An Executive Secretariat in charge of actually&#13;
developing and/or evaluating proposals and carrying out day-to-day activities would be established.&#13;
RTCC would be responsible for developing an integrated urban transport and air quality strategy for&#13;
the BHMR that is compatible with the land use policies jointly developed with the land use agencies&#13;
of the BHMR.&#13;
2.           The following questions must be asked when defining the functions of the RTCC: (a)&#13;
How are transport plans prepared, and how often are they updated? Is a single entity responsible for&#13;
their preparation across all modes (highways, metro, suburban rail, bus/busways) and the entire region,&#13;
or are separate plans prepared by the respective municipalities, building and operating companies and&#13;
then put together by a coordinating agency? (b) Who monitors the condition and performance of the&#13;
transport systems, and how do the results of the monitoring feed into the planning process? (c) What&#13;
is the relationship between the transport plan(s) and the respective land use plans developed by the&#13;
municipalities? (d) What is the relationship between the plan(s) developed under question (a) above,&#13;
and the multi-year capital program developed by the various implementing authorities? Is the project&#13;
flow top-down (i.e., emanates from the plan), bottom-up (generated by the implementers/operators),&#13;
or both? and (e) Do the various operating companies have direct access to funding or should their&#13;
capital budgets be approved either by the SMG or the new RTCC?&#13;
3.           At the suggestion of the Bank, SMG, MBH, MB and MC have created a forerunner of&#13;
the RTCC, the Grupo Permanente de Planejamento Integrado (GPPI), and with the support of the MBH,&#13;
it has launched studies to define the role, responsibilities, composition and funding of the RTCC. As&#13;
a condition of negotiations, the GPPI should be established by an implementation agreement&#13;
"convenio" signed by the SMG and MBH.&#13;
B. RTCC's Proposed Structure, Composition and Role&#13;
4.           The general structure of an entity in charge of coordinating transport policy, prioritizing&#13;
major investments, and defining air quality and traffic safety objectives and policies pertaining to urban&#13;
transport in the 1 8 municipalities that make up the BHMR is outlined below. This report highlights the&#13;
basic features of a proposed solution which attempts to comply with the objectives described above.&#13;
Institutional Background&#13;
5.           The BHMR comprises 18 independent municipalities, each with its own Mayor and&#13;
Municipal Council (Camara de Vereadores), of which the Municipality of Belo Horizonte (Prefeitura),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -                               ANNEX 3&#13;
also the State Capital, is by far the largest and most important from the economic and political&#13;
standpoints. The State Constitution indicates that public transport of regional interest is to be planned&#13;
and coordinated by the State Government together with the Municipalities involved. Such is the case&#13;
with many transport routes in the BHMR. In fact, even some transport services within the boundaries&#13;
of a specific Municipality can be of regional interest and, as such, should be planned jointly. The DER-&#13;
MG has been entrusted with the task of fostering joint transport planning efforts within the BHMR,&#13;
with assistance from a local strategic transport planning body which would include representatives&#13;
from the State and from municipal governments.&#13;
6.           Metropolitan Regions in Brazil have been defined but have not been legally established.&#13;
For that reason, a level of government hierarchically superior to city governments but below the State&#13;
level does not exist in practice. In parallel, the 1 988 Federal Constitution has strongly enhanced the&#13;
independence of Municipal authorities in many functions, one of them being transport policy and&#13;
regulation. Therefore, discussions towards metropolitan transport coordination must be accompanied&#13;
by the provision of an adequate State-level institutional framework, which should be simple but should&#13;
also have the leverage to elicit effective interest from Municipalities, as benefits from joining the&#13;
common planning effort become more clearly outlined.&#13;
Basic Concepts&#13;
7.     In light of the aforementioned legal constraints, local (BHMR and elsewhere in Brazil)&#13;
experiments in metropolitan transport coordination have continued, some with a reasonable degree of&#13;
success. These indicate that the key elements for the sustainability of the proposed coordination are&#13;
as follows: (a) it should be conceived as a permanent structure, designed to outlive executive or&#13;
legislative mandate periods; (b) it should be accepted by the parties as an additional asset and not as&#13;
a threat to their autonomy or decision-making powers (even though the power balance may, and&#13;
probably will, shift at its inception); (c) it will not interfere with jurisdictions which belong to those&#13;
parties, notwithstanding the fact that it will be granted a specific political status, and its own specific&#13;
powers; and (d) it should not assume the functions of a Public Company (Empresa), nor should it be&#13;
in charge of operations of any kind. These conditions for long-term sustainability of an entity of this&#13;
type may restrict the scope of work to only a few basic functions, which will, however, constitute the&#13;
basis upon which to develop further coordinating responsibilities. The proposed coordinating body will&#13;
hereafter be referred to as the Regional Transport Coordination Commission (RTCC). Experience in&#13;
other countries, such as that of the United States, indicates that the planning function is the best&#13;
support for actions aimed at transport coordination. Such planning aims at the establishment of a fully&#13;
integrated public transport system, and this concept should always be present as a basic guideline for&#13;
coordination proposals and for the implementation of the related institutional framework.&#13;
8.           Within the planning function, priorities should be appropriately defined. Actions might&#13;
begin, for example, with investment policy and fare policy coordination, and later encompass physical&#13;
planning, traffic management, and system operations. Such phasing-in would be supported by a&#13;
common strategic vision of the metropolitan transport system. RTCC would have an important role in&#13;
the decision-making process regarding the transfer of transport-related funds from the State and&#13;
Federal levels to the municipalities. Projects submitted to the World Bank and other multilateral&#13;
agencies should first be prioritized by the RTCC. It should be noted that granting such powers may be&#13;
one of the most difficult points to be agreed upon. If, however, the final investment decisions are left&#13;
out from RTCC attributes, RTCC would become little more than a forum for discussions (and eventual&#13;
decisions) on metropolitan transport matters, with little or no coordinating role. Budget control by&#13;
RTCC would be more naturally accepted by the parties involved, given a set of political mechanisms,&#13;
such as: (a) assuring an adequate balance between state and municipal points of view concerning&#13;
planning decisions; (b) active involvement of the Federal government, considering that good transport&#13;
performance in large urban areas is to be viewed as a matter of national interest, and not only as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -                              ANNEX 3&#13;
concern of local government entities; and (c) implementation of a permanent planning process,&#13;
continuously incorporating relevant new information as it is made available, with emphasis on socio-&#13;
economic and environmental changes and proposed improvements to the transport system, always&#13;
from a strategic point of view.&#13;
9.           DER-MG and BHTRANS's role will be crucial for a successful RTCC. The Metropolitan&#13;
Transport Secretary would represent the State Government and preside over the Executive Secretariat.&#13;
Also, BHTRANS would provide RTCC with the necessary technical and administrative support. In the&#13;
event that BHMR becomes a legally recognized entity, RTCC would naturally be absorbed into a fuller&#13;
metropolitan planning structure, and this possibility should be taken into account from the earliest&#13;
phases of its conception by MBH. The establishment of the RTCC as a permanent body, as mentioned&#13;
before, will require a search for the most suitable legal framework. Also, RTCC components would be&#13;
designed with that in mind, giving priority to stable relations with all government levels, while&#13;
maintaining sound political and technical supporting structures. When the RTCC is established, existing&#13;
bodies with related functions would be terminated or absorbed into it. Based on the above discussion,&#13;
the CBTU has proposed an implementation agreement or "convAnio' to establish the RTCC. Highlights&#13;
of the "convenio" are given below.&#13;
General Description of RTCC&#13;
10.          Objective. As stated in the draft convenio to establishes the RTCC, its overall objectives&#13;
are to carry out transport planning of the BHMR, in order to ensure that transport plans and programs&#13;
by the State and related Municipalities are compatible with metropolitan plans, to define transport&#13;
policy and standards, to prioritize investments and to coordinate transport investment expenditures.&#13;
11.          Composition. RTCC will be chaired by a State Secretary, and will include the Secretary&#13;
of Transport of the Municipality of BH and the Mayors of the BHMR who will adhere to the "conv6nio".&#13;
The convenio includes a specific clause to be signed by the mayor of each of the participating BHMR&#13;
municipalities. Adherence to the convenio will facilitate future State funding in the municipalities.&#13;
12.          Organization. RTCC's structure will include two bodies: (a) an Executive Committee&#13;
(EC) composed of the State Secretary of Metropolitan Transport who will act as the Chairman or&#13;
President, the Secretary of Transport of the Municipality of BH who will act as secretary of the EC,&#13;
the State Coordinator for Assistance to the Municipalities for Public Transport, and the State&#13;
Coordinator for Planning and Management, the mayors representing the municipalities in each of the&#13;
six sub-regions defined in the convenio, and the presidents of the operating agencies STU-BH,&#13;
BHTRANS, DER-MG and bus operator associations; and (b) the Grupo Permanente de Planejamento&#13;
Integrado (GPPI) which will act as the technical secretariat for the RTCC. GPPI would be headed by&#13;
a permanent Executive Secretary. It will be the responsibility of the president to convene the EC's&#13;
meetings. GPPI would organize the meeting and prepare their agenda based on suggestions received&#13;
from EC's members.&#13;
13.          Municipal Subregions. As mentioned above, up to six groups of municipalities would&#13;
be formed, consisting of neighboring cities with common transport interests. Each group would&#13;
deliberate about transport and traffic management issues within their respective areas, and would elect&#13;
a mayor to represent it at the EC.&#13;
14.          State/City Permanent Planning Committee. (Grupo Permanente de Planejamento&#13;
Integrado - GPPI). Composed of representatives from CBTU and from the "Prefeitura' of Belo Horizonte&#13;
transport and traffic management agencies, the planning committee would deal with selected items&#13;
affecting City and State. Meetings would be held every two weeks, or more frequently if needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -                               ANNEX 3&#13;
Representatives from other areas or agencies and independent professionals may be invited for&#13;
discussion on specific issues.&#13;
15.          Executive Secretary. The role of the Executive Secretary will be to provide support to&#13;
the RTCC and to see that decisions are properly implemented. This function would be carried out by&#13;
a SMG-appointed representative. Revisions of the Transport Plan, tactical studies concerning specific&#13;
items within the transport system, periodic checking of plans and programs against strategic&#13;
guidelines, promotion of specific events for information interchange with other sectors of the&#13;
metropolitan administration, and execution of surveys and studies to support RTCC decisions, are some&#13;
of the tasks to be managed by the Executive Secretary.&#13;
1 6.         The RTCC structure would be funded through State (50 percent) and Municipal (50&#13;
percent) grants. Total funding requirements would be defined by the Executive Secretary no later than&#13;
August of each year, to be submitted for General Assembly approval or modification at its regular&#13;
meeting in September. Decisions by consensus would be preferred, with decision by voting as&#13;
necessary. Mayors would rotate as Chairpersons of the municipal groups.&#13;
17.         It will be a dated covenant that SMG and MBH establish a formal Regional Transport&#13;
Coordination Commission not later than a year after loan effectiveness. It was agreed that&#13;
BHTRANS/DER-MG will ensure that bus routes will be re-routed to the stations of the system and that&#13;
such re-routing will occur as each new station or segment of the Santa Inds - Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link&#13;
becomes available for operation. It was also agreed that BHTRANS/DER-MG will curb the use of illegal&#13;
bus operations especially if they serve routes parallel to the rail lines. Finally, it was agreed that the&#13;
State should not later than 1 2 months after effectiveness, submit evidence to the Bank that financing&#13;
mechanisms are in place to ensure coverage of the MG Entity's operating subsidy if any.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.          In an effort to increase private sector participation in the project, CBTU has met with&#13;
the Chamber of Commerce, associations of civil works contractors, equipment manufacturers and real&#13;
estate specialists. The latter indicated that they are interested in exploring mechanisms for developing&#13;
real estate in and around the stations, and have initiated a series of meetings with CBTU and STU-BH&#13;
personnel to examine the most suitable sites. In general, the associations indicated that there is need&#13;
for some changes in municipal legislation to capitalize on the additional floor space created by new&#13;
buildings in the aerial space of the right-of-way and surrounding areas. STU-BH already has a few&#13;
tentative programs of rental of station space and advertising but this should be given more attention&#13;
as a revenue source.&#13;
2.           Although there are at least two projects for the development of shopping areas and for&#13;
apartment buildings, the participants indicated that they are reluctant to commit themselves until they&#13;
see some progress in the works of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link. The general consensus was also that&#13;
in view of the very high cost of credit to buy houses, it is unlikely that there would be a substantial&#13;
number of buyers. Participants asked the pre-appraisal mission whether the Bank could help with&#13;
housing credits as it was done in previous urban development loans. The representatives of the&#13;
associations indicated that they are interested in exploring mechanisms to develop real estate in and&#13;
around the stations and asked STU-BH personnel to provide them with more detailed data on the most&#13;
interesting sites. They also indicated that in the past the long delays in the completion of STU-BH&#13;
works make any substantial investments in real estate in the surrounding areas very risky. Bank&#13;
financing of the proposed project changes the picture and will create incentives for private sector&#13;
participation but they want to wait until the project is in progress.&#13;
B. Recommendations&#13;
3.           To examine the financial instruments which can encourage private participation in the&#13;
construction and operation of selected parts of the mass transit systems, CBTU has created a high-&#13;
level working group of entrepreneurs and financiers. Many aspects of this program appear to be&#13;
appropriate for private or joint public/private development, which could result in considerable savings.&#13;
Station development is the most obvious, but consideration should also be given to leasing of some&#13;
existing stations and transfer points for private sector development and operation. Disposition of&#13;
excess railway land and air rights would also be explored. CBTU has invited a high-level group including&#13;
respected outsiders such as elected officials, investment bankers, prominent developers, civil works&#13;
contractors, and Chamber of Commerce representatives, to explore this as well as other ways to&#13;
"capture" some of the added value of railway real estate development and prepare proposals for&#13;
inclusion in the program.&#13;
4.     Since the project involves a decentralization and therefore a change of asset ownership, it was&#13;
agreed that any concessions to the private sector should be made preferably after the transfer of&#13;
ownership. On the basis of the above, it was agreed between CBTU and the Bank that to foster the&#13;
participation of the private sector in the system, the State/municipality shareholder's agreement will&#13;
contain a clause which will require that the State shall cause the MG Entity to offer at least four&#13;
invitations to bid for private sector exploitation of trains, station space, aerial space, parking areas,&#13;
automatic ticket collection and other areas within one year of the transfer.&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
1.           General. The CBTU Belo Horizonte subdivision system (STU-BH) has a network of 18.2&#13;
km of trackage (Map IBRD 26914) organized in one corridor from Eldorado to Santa Ines which was&#13;
inaugurated in stages starting in August 1986. It is electrified, with double, broad gauge 1 .60 m) track&#13;
for exclusive passenger services. The 5.0 km extension from Santa Inds to S3o Paulo is currently under&#13;
construction, infrastructure works are expected to be completed by December 1995. The project has&#13;
been designed to foster intermodal integration of STU-BH system with the bus network. It consists of&#13;
the construction of four new stations in the Eldorado to S3o Paulo section and of a 7.0 km extension&#13;
of the electrified system from S3o Paulo to Vilarinho, with five new stations. It also includes the&#13;
addition of bus transfer facilities and road accesses to stations to enhance intermodal integration in&#13;
the area of influence of STU-BH. A brief description of the investments included in the project is&#13;
presented in the next paragraphs.&#13;
2.           Civil Works. A summary of the main works is shown in Table 5.1 and described below:&#13;
(a)   Intermodal Integration. The works to be implemented under this program&#13;
consist of: (i) the Integrated Terminals program designed to improve the&#13;
intermodal integration of STU-BH system with urban buses serving the&#13;
metropolitan region, and entails the construction of three integrated terminals&#13;
(Jose C. Silveira, S3o Paulo and Vilarinho). The terminals will facilitate and&#13;
speed the transfer of passengers between bus and rail modes thus minimizing&#13;
overall passenger trip times. They consist of bus roadways, parking and&#13;
passenger queuing areas and are an integral part of the rail stations; (ii) the&#13;
Road Accesses program, aimed at improving the road accesses to all STU-BH&#13;
stations, consisting of: (a) traffic engineering measures such as signals, signs&#13;
and revised intersection layouts; and (b) bus access improvements such as&#13;
construction of short road links missing in the existing network, busways, bus&#13;
lanes, and shelters for bus passengers; (iii) the Accesses for Pedestrians&#13;
Program would consist of the construction of sidewalks and pedestrian&#13;
over/underpasses to improve convenience and reduce walking times to and&#13;
from STU-BH stations; and (iv) the Road Traffic Control Program includes: (a)&#13;
an area-wide traffic circulation scheme (a centralized signal control system)&#13;
controlling some 350 signalized intersections; (b) the provision of a radio&#13;
operated bus locator control system; and (c) upgrading of Route 710, providing&#13;
improved road access to the Jose C. Silveira terminal. The proposed works,&#13;
including contingencies, amount to about US$18.6 million or 9 percent of the&#13;
total cost of the project.&#13;
(b)   Passenger Stations. The existing 1 1 passenger stations in the Eldorado-Santa&#13;
Ines section, which were built during the period 1 983-1 994, are functional and&#13;
of modern design, they are well maintained and can cope with the existing and&#13;
projected passenger demand. The passenger stations program calls for the&#13;
construction of nine new stations. This component envisages expenditures,&#13;
including contingencies, of about US$24.0 million or 1 2 percent of total project&#13;
cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -                               ANNEX 5&#13;
(c)   Bridges, Road Viaducts and Pedestrian Over/underpasses. The existing right-of-&#13;
way of the STU-BH is fenced and is not subject to road traffic interferences.&#13;
This program is designed to eliminate road and pedestrian interferences in the&#13;
new section to Vilarinho and entails the construction of four bridges, two road&#13;
viaducts (one in the Horto-Sao Paulo section) and six pedestrian&#13;
over/underpasses (one in Eldorado-Santa Ines section). The cost of these&#13;
works, including contingencies, has been estimated at about US$21.3 million&#13;
or 11 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(d)   Administrative Building. The program includes the construction of a building for&#13;
STU-BH administration. Currently, STU-BH rents office space in various&#13;
buildings for its activities. The cost of these works has been estimated at&#13;
US$2.6 million including contingencies.&#13;
3.           Permanent Way. The double, broad gauge ( 1.60 m) track in the existing Eldorado-Santa&#13;
Inds Line has a minimum radius of 160 m, maximum grades of 3 percent, and is laid with 57 kg/m&#13;
welded rails. Sleepers are monoblock of pre-stressed concrete with elastic rail fastenings laid on&#13;
crushed stone ballast. The track is in good condition and permits speeds up to 90 km/h. The Permanent&#13;
Way program included in the project entails: (a) the provision of track materials for the section from&#13;
Santa Inds to Sao Paulo (5.0 km); and (b) the construction of 7.0 km of electrified, double, broad&#13;
gauge (1.60 m) track extension from Sao Paulo to Vilarinho. The track layout also calls for the&#13;
construction of a 225 m tunnel. The track would have maximum grades of 3 percent, minimum radius&#13;
of 300 m, and the same standards as the existing track in operation. These works also include the&#13;
construction of fences along the new right-of-way. The realization of these works would require land&#13;
expropriation and resettlement to be able to carry out the proposed works in the Sao Paulo, Dona Clara&#13;
and Vilarinho areas. The proposed works, including contingencies, have been estimated to cost about&#13;
US$51.6 million or 26 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
4.           Systems. A summary description of the systems currently operated by STU-BH and&#13;
related components included in the project are presented below:&#13;
(a)   Electrification Program. The electric energy is generated and distributed by&#13;
CEMIG which in turn feeds two sub-stations for the operations of the STU-BH&#13;
system. The network of overhead contact lines with power supplied at 3.0 kV&#13;
DC is well maintained. The two sub-stations are strategically located in the&#13;
Cidade Industrial and Carlos Prates areas. There are section cabins to reduce&#13;
the effects of voltage drops and sectionalize the line. The entire system is&#13;
telecommanded through the operational control center (CCO). The electric&#13;
systems are well maintained. This program includes: (i) the installation of 7.0&#13;
km of overhead catenary (double line) with 3 kV DC and motorized switches;&#13;
(ii) 7.0-km transmission cables of 6.6 kV; and (ii) the construction of one sub-&#13;
station close to Vilarinho station, and one sectionalizing cabin at Sao Paulo.&#13;
These works, including contingencies, have been estimated to cost US$7.1&#13;
million or 4 percent of total project cost.&#13;
(b)   Signaling Program. The existing signaling system in the corridor includes the&#13;
following components: (i) the Centralized Traffic Control (CTC), which allows&#13;
a Central Operator to set routes for trains by controlling eight remote interlocks&#13;
and to monitor headways and train positions; (ii) Relay Interlocks, consisting&#13;
of ten signaling relay rooms located at selected passenger stations that confirm&#13;
the vital interlocking relay circuits for the traffic safety of STU-BH's trains are&#13;
correct and would allow local control of switches in case of failure in the link&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -                               ANNEX 5&#13;
to the CTC; and (iii) the Automatic Train Control (ATC), consisting of special&#13;
equipment such as transmitters along the track and a cab signaling system on&#13;
board of the Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) that controls train speeds within&#13;
safety limits. The existing signaling system is not reliable, however, due to&#13;
problems of old design and equipment with limited capacity. As a result, traffic&#13;
is supplement-controlled via telephone communications. This program includes:&#13;
(i) the replacement of the existing CTC system from Eldorado to Sao Paulo; (ii)&#13;
the installation of vital interlocking relay circuits in the 5.0-km section from&#13;
Santa Ines to S5o Paulo with materials and equipment already in stock and&#13;
specific connections to the new Entroncamento and Vila Oeste stations; and&#13;
(iii) the supply and installation of a new system in the 6.5-km extension Sao&#13;
Paulo - Vilarinho, including CTC, ATC and interlocking relays. The cost of these&#13;
works, including contingencies, have been estimated at US$15.6 million or 8&#13;
percent of total project cost.&#13;
(c)   Telecommunications Program. The telecommunications are carried out by a&#13;
special underground cable along the right-of-way. A radio system links the CCO&#13;
with trains, stations, and maintenance workshops. In addition, the system&#13;
provides telephone communications for general administration and operations,&#13;
CCTV (Closed Circuits TV) at 11 stations, and supports clock and public&#13;
address sub-systems in the stations. All communications are recorded. The&#13;
project includes the installation of: (i) a telephone central station; Jii) a&#13;
telecommunication system for the section Sao Paulo - Vilarinho, with the same&#13;
characteristics of the existing system operating in the corridor; and (iii) a&#13;
ticketing control systems in all 20 stations from Eldorado to Vilarinho. Including&#13;
contingencies, this program has been estimated to cost US$5.3 million or 3&#13;
percent of total project cost.&#13;
5.           Workshop Equipment. The STU-BH network is served by workshops strategically&#13;
located at Eldorado and Carlos Prates terminals and provide light maintenance and one year revisions&#13;
to the EMU fleet. A maintenance facility for heavy overhaul of the EMUs is under construction at&#13;
Matadouro, close to the Sao Paulo terminal. This program includes the provision of miscellaneous&#13;
equipment for this workshop and maintenance equipment for the permanent way and systems (Table&#13;
5.2). Including contingencies, this component is estimated to cost US$8.3 million or 4 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;
6.           Rolling Stock. The existing passenger train fleet of STU-BH's EMUs consists of seven&#13;
broad gauge (1 .60 m) units. There is another new unit being tested, and seven more units are being&#13;
manufactured. These units are expected to be delivered early in 1 997. Each unit is composed of four&#13;
cars (two with motors and two trailers). The units are of stainless steel and have 60 and 71 seats (cars&#13;
with motors and trailer cars respectively) with a maximum capacity of 1,278 passengers per EMU.&#13;
Their main characteristics are: 276 kw per engine (2.2 Megawatts), electric controlled, 3 kv overhead&#13;
feeder, dynamic brakes and designed to run at a maximum speed of 90 km/h. Currently, there are six&#13;
units in service. There is an average fleet availability of 86 percent. Five of these units have an average&#13;
of 1.0 million travelled km, well over the 0.6 million km recommended by the manufacturers. These&#13;
units have never had general overhauls. It has been established that in order to cope with the forecast&#13;
demand of 322,000 passengers per day soon after project opening, and operate with train schedules&#13;
and head-ways of four and eight minutes during rush and non-rush hours, STU-BH would need a fleet&#13;
of 25 EMUs. The rolling stock program has been designed to increase the transport capacity of the&#13;
system. To complement the existing fleet, the program includes: (a) the general overhaul of 5 EMUs;&#13;
and (b) the acquisition of 10 EMUs. This component, including contingencies, is estimated to cost&#13;
US$25.6 million or 1 3 percent of total project cost.&#13;

- 49 -                              ANNEX 5&#13;
7.           Engineering Designs. Final engineering designs for the construction of permanent way&#13;
and the two new stations at Jose Silveira and Minas Shopping in the Santa Ines-Sao Paulo section&#13;
have been completed. Design works for the new stations at Vila Oeste and Entroncamento in the&#13;
Eldorado-Santa Inds section and for the extension from Sao Paulo to Vilarinho, as well as those&#13;
required for the Intermodal Integration Program (under the responsibility of BHTRANS) are underway.&#13;
It is scheduled that by appraisal, STU-BH would have final engineering designs available for all&#13;
components included in the first year of project implementation. Technical specifications for the&#13;
acquisition of rolling stock is already available, and those required for the provision of the&#13;
electrification, signaling, and telecommunications systems, and maintenance equipment are&#13;
programmed to be ready by mid-1995.&#13;
8.           Supervision. The project includes the provision of consultants (2,350 staff/months) for&#13;
the implementation and supervision of each of the project components mentioned above. The cost of&#13;
these services have been estimated at US$5.6 million including contingencies or 3 percent of total&#13;
project cost.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRAFFIC SAFETY COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           This section describes the environmental and traffic safety component of the proposed&#13;
project which includes:&#13;
(a)   the design of a vehicle inspection and maintenance program;&#13;
(b)   the development of a comprehensive traffic management and control program&#13;
for the BHMR with emphasis on the area of influence of the STU-BH; and&#13;
(c)   the installation of a centralized traffic control system.&#13;
In addition, the proposed project includes studies and technical assistance to support improvements&#13;
in motor vehicle emissions control and the development of an integrated transport/environmental&#13;
strategy for the BHMR.&#13;
2.           The electrification of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link would result in direct and indirect&#13;
benefits concerning air quality. Direct benefits would result from the reduction in auto and bus traffic&#13;
due to the new train links; the design of an inspection/maintenance program will set the foundations&#13;
for the implementation of a comprehensive program which will be the first step towards curbing vehicle&#13;
emissions in the BHMR. The development of a traffic management, control, and safety program would&#13;
also have a beneficial effect on vehicle emissions and accidents especially in and around existing at-&#13;
grade crossings which would be grade separated. Indirect air quality benefits would result from the&#13;
development and implementation of an integrated transport and air quality strategy, and from&#13;
strengthening of vehicle emissions planning, regulation and enforcement.&#13;
B. The Environmental Sub-Component&#13;
3.          Inspection and maintenance (l/M) serves two purposes in a vehicle emissions control&#13;
program. First, it helps to identify vehicles in which maladjustments or other mechanical problems are&#13;
causing higher emissions than necessary. Second, it ensures that the emission control equipment on&#13;
vehicles so equipped remains in place and operational, so that the emissions benefits of that equipment&#13;
are realized. The first purpose applies mostly to older vehicles without emission controls; for emission-&#13;
controlled vehicles, the second is much more important. An effective l/M program is essential to ensure&#13;
that the emissions benefits projected for the adoption of new vehicle emissions standards are actually&#13;
attained. The project finances the design of an l/M program and will recommend how the l/M program&#13;
can be implemented through concessions to the private sector.&#13;
C. The Traffic Safety Program&#13;
4.           The objective of the traffic management component is to design and put in place a&#13;
number of traffic management and safety policies and investments which, when coupled with the rail&#13;
and air quality component, will enhance the quality of public transport, reduce congestion, and greatly&#13;
improve safety.&#13;
5.           The Traffic management component of the proposed project would comprise the design&#13;
of: (a) the Traffic Control subcomponent; and (b) the Traffic Safety subcomponent. They are described&#13;
below in detail.&#13;
&#13;

Cl. The Traffic Control Subcomponent&#13;
6.           Semi-actuated Traffic Lights. Electro-mechanical "old style" traffic light controllers make&#13;
coordination among separate locations difficult without interconnections. In some locations the causes&#13;
of accidents have been traced to this limitation. Such is the case, for example, with the intersection&#13;
between a main road with high traffic volume and a very low volume secondary road, which however&#13;
presents significant flows at peak periods. During off-peak hours, long periods of red for the main road,&#13;
without a corresponding traffic flow from the side street, often prompt drivers to "go through" the red&#13;
light, which will eventually lead to an accident. There are about 75 such locations across the city area,&#13;
which require replacement of the existing traffic signal controller by a semi-actuated model, with loop&#13;
detectors, which will be able to adequately handle demand variations throughout the day. Twenty&#13;
other unsignalized intersections require implementation of semi-actuated traffic light systems, some&#13;
with a cycle that will include phases to accommodate pedestrian crossing movements.&#13;
C2. The Traffic Safety Subcomponent&#13;
7.           Traffic Management and Safety. An important objective of the project is to reduce&#13;
congestion and improve safety. A new traffic signal system is proposed. However, a more definitive&#13;
safety program needed to be defined to complement the on-going efforts of the Municipality. As a&#13;
minimum, this program includes:&#13;
(a)   a description of current safety activities;&#13;
(b)   identification of most serious accident locations and their deficiencies, and&#13;
selection of those to be included in the project;&#13;
(c)   definition of a program to specifically address the high rate of pedestrian&#13;
accidents;&#13;
(d)   approximate costs and implementation schedule to correct the deficiencies in&#13;
(b) and implement the program in (c). Identify the agency responsible for&#13;
implementation of the program(s); and&#13;
(e)   prepare designs for any civil work required.&#13;
This program is summarized in documents which were submitted to the Bank and the proposed&#13;
component was based on that program.&#13;
C3. Policy Issues&#13;
8.           The importance of appropriate policy measures to achieve the ultimate objective of&#13;
reducing the rate of motorization in BHMR and consequent delays, pollution, and excessive use of fuel&#13;
was emphasized by the Bank. BHTRANS will develop an action plan and TOR for studies which call&#13;
for (among other issues identified in the appraisal process) the following:&#13;
(a)   a parking policy and implementation plan which correctly charges for the use&#13;
of valuable downtown space for "automobile storage" and provides a&#13;
disincentive for people to drive to the central area rather than use public&#13;
transport. This implies the need for a comprehensive, safe and comfortable&#13;
public transport system into which the public and private sector are currently&#13;
investing hundreds of millions of dollars. The action plan calls for specific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                               ANNEX 6&#13;
implementation of the recommendations of the parking plan by the third or&#13;
fourth year of the project with some measures beginning earlier;&#13;
(b)    pricing mechanisms which will ultimately be the only real deterrent to&#13;
continued automobile traffic growth in the central area. Experience throughout&#13;
the world indicates that the effect of metros is temporary if at all; the metro&#13;
provides the alternative mode which allows appropriate pricing and provides&#13;
some disincentive to drive into the central area. Without the ultimate achieve-&#13;
ment of a reduction in the growth of automobile traffic in the city, the&#13;
investment in the metro is questionable. A pricing policy and plan of imple-&#13;
mentation is to be developed as part of the project, and implementation will&#13;
begin as the metro is nearing completion; and&#13;
(c)   frequently circulating vehicles (taxis, buses, government vehicles) contribute&#13;
to pollution in the city and provide a controllable environment within which to&#13;
test the value of alternative fuels as a measure of reducing harmful emissions.&#13;
A pilot program using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) will be developed and&#13;
initiated, with the objective of testing the proposal of not allowing buses or&#13;
taxis to operate in the city center unless they use clean-burning fuels.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY STUDIES&#13;
1.           This Annex describes the studies and training to be undertaken as a basis for the policy&#13;
and institutional development action plan. The studies will be divided in three categories: (a) studies&#13;
which are only CBTU related; (b) studies to enhance modal integration; and (c) studies which examine&#13;
the decentralization and financing mechanisms aspects. The training component should contribute to&#13;
the skill upgrading of staff at all levels through recycling, as well as training in-house and abroad.&#13;
2.           A list of the proposed studies and training is presented below. Draft Terms of Reference&#13;
for each study were agreed at appraisal and were ready by negotiations.&#13;
A. CBTU Related Studies&#13;
3.           Preparation and implementation of a manpower development and organization plan with&#13;
staff rationalization. This study will review the organization of each of the new systems by functional&#13;
area and as a whole. It will provide job descriptions for each of the main posts and a strategy to&#13;
rationalize the staff. It will review the salary scale and benefits and, based on equivalent positions in&#13;
the private sector, propose a new salary scale and a chronogram for its implementation. It will also&#13;
define the training requirements and recycling to be undertaken under the training component. Finally,&#13;
it will propose a new admissions policy based on the needs of the new companies.&#13;
4.           Preparation of a cost accounting, tariff, management information systems, and financial&#13;
management study. At this stage, it is clear that the existing systems need a good costing group which&#13;
is capable of determining the long-run variable costs of the system and for that purpose separate the&#13;
fixed costs from the variable costs. In addition, the accounting and finance directorate should be&#13;
equipped with the required management information systems to allow a timely analysis of the costs.&#13;
Finally, the Planning Department should be prepared to estimate and operate on a regular basis the&#13;
tariff schedule, integrated tariffs, multi-trip tariffs, etc., using the information from the cost systems,&#13;
information from the competitive modes, and socio-economic constraints.&#13;
5.           Preparation of an action plan (and its implementation) to improve the management of&#13;
stocks. The system should have a computerized inventory management which will allow internal&#13;
control and prevent lack of spares due to poor programming. This action plan should be implemented&#13;
soon and will contribute to better rolling stock availability.&#13;
6.           Preparation of proposals to subcontract maintenance and other operations to the private&#13;
sector. This study should examine the operational activities which could be subcontracted to the&#13;
private sector at competitive prices (at least two competing sources) and indicate the staff reductions&#13;
which can be achieved and potential operating savings if those activities are subcontracted.&#13;
7.           Action and revenue plan through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate&#13;
development on CBTU's real estate and action plan for their implementation. This plan should indicate&#13;
very clearly what are the non-operating revenues which each of the CBTU new systems can earn&#13;
through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate development. The study should provide&#13;
a detailed estimate of income and costs and suggest how the proposed plan should be implemented,&#13;
i.e., in-house or through outside parties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -                               ANNEX 7&#13;
8.           Marketing STU-BH's Image. After the system is decentralized, management must&#13;
undertake a marketing campaign to improve STU-BH's image and attract new ridership. This study will&#13;
discuss proposals to improve STU-BH's image, the marketing plan to implement them, and the&#13;
incentives to attract new ridership.&#13;
B. Modal Integration Studies&#13;
9.           A study to update the Transport portion of the Master Plan for BH with emphasis on&#13;
route rationalization, modal and tariff integration. The BHMR Master Plan should be updated to account&#13;
for the BH Municipality Master Plan and recent changes in land use. Basic guidelines for the&#13;
development of future systems must be prepared.&#13;
10.          Feasibility study and preliminary design of integration terminals in the BHMR, with&#13;
identification of private sector participation. Modal integration is one of the main priorities of this&#13;
project. The lack of integration terminals has not facilitated modal integration. Exploration of integration&#13;
terminals by the private sector may induce rerouting of buses to the railway stations, thereby reducing&#13;
congestion. This study will examine main integration terminals in the BHMR and identify opportunities&#13;
for their management by the private sector.&#13;
C. Financing Mechanisms&#13;
11.          Financing mechanisms study with recommendations on how to cover operating deficits&#13;
and capital investment, action plan and chronogram for implementation. This study will identify the&#13;
financing mechanisms available and those proposed to cover the operating subsidies and capital&#13;
investment requirements of STU-BH. Federal, State and Municipality contributions should be clearly&#13;
identified. The study should make concrete recommendations and prepare a draft of Decrees to be&#13;
discussed by the State legislature to provide the funds required. The study should also discuss how&#13;
these funds should be allocated and the role of the RTCC in assigning these subsidies.&#13;
D. Decentralization Studies&#13;
12.          Preparation and implementation of a plan to hand over the subdivisions, including the&#13;
legal, financial and institutional arrangements. This study will produce a detailed action plan for the&#13;
transfer of the CBTU subdivision to the State. In the action plan, all legal, financial and institutional&#13;
arrangements to be undertaken at each step will be identified. Preparatory work, such as inventory of&#13;
assets of the subdivision, will be done at this stage.&#13;
E. Management Information Systems&#13;
13.          This component is intended to provide the new CBTU system with the basic software&#13;
and hardware required to perform the needed accounting, financial management and planning&#13;
functions.&#13;
F. Training&#13;
14.          Training will take place at all levels of the organization as proposed in the&#13;
recommendations of the Manpower Development studies. The training may consist of in-house, on-the-&#13;
job training, or visits and courses abroad in specific areas.&#13;

G. Implementation Program&#13;
15.          Policy and Institutional Development Action Plan:&#13;
(a)   Decentralization Action Plan of the STU-BH System. In carrying out the&#13;
decentralization of the system, CBTU and the State shall:&#13;
(i)    no later than September 30, 1996 complete a study and an action&#13;
plan for the transfer of the STU-BH system to the State. In the action&#13;
plan, all legal, financial and institutional arrangements to be&#13;
undertaken, as well as the inventory of assets of STU-BH, will be&#13;
included (CBTU, State);&#13;
(ii)   no later than September 30, 1996 complete a study which will&#13;
determine the long-run variable costs of the STU-BH system, using the&#13;
most appropriate methods available, and will propose the creation of&#13;
a data base for more accurate costing and recommend a tariff system&#13;
which is cost-based and takes into account modal integration and&#13;
affordability issues (CBTU, State);&#13;
(iii)  no later than October 31, 1996 complete a study and an action plan&#13;
for the setting up of a cost accounting system and management&#13;

sector. This study should examine the operational activities which&#13;
could be subcontracted to the private sector at competitive prices (at&#13;
least two competing sources) and indicate the staff reductions which&#13;
can be achieved and potential operating savings if those activities are&#13;
subcontracted (State, CBTU);&#13;
(iv)   no later than December 31, 1996 prepare and implement an action&#13;
and revenue plan through promotion of station space, advertising and&#13;
real estate development on the STU-BH. This plan should indicate&#13;
clearly what are the non-operating revenues which STU-BH can earn&#13;
through promotion of station space, advertising and real estate&#13;
development. The study should provide a detailed estimate of income&#13;
and costs and suggest how the proposed plan should be implemented,&#13;
i.e., in-house or through outside parties (State); and&#13;
(v)    no later than December 31, 1 996 prepare an action plan to market the&#13;
STU-BH. After the system is decentralized, management must&#13;

integrate STU-BH and the bus system. CBTU's integration with the&#13;
bus system is an objective already set by the State. This study will&#13;
propose alternatives for the physical, organizational, and financial&#13;
merger of the two systems. It will make recommendations to the State&#13;
on how to proceed with the merger (State. CBTU); and&#13;
(ii)   no later than December 31, 1996 complete a study to update a&#13;
proposed master plan for integration of transport services in the BHMR&#13;
(the Master Plan) with emphasis on route rationalization, modal and&#13;
tariff integration. The Master Plan will be updated to emphasize the&#13;
integration between buses and the rail system. If need be, an origin-&#13;
destination traffic survey will also be included. Basic guidelines for the&#13;
development of new systems and integration terminals must be.&#13;
outlined.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           A standard cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate the economic impact of the&#13;
implementation of the proposed infrastructure and equipment component (Eldorado - Vilarinho link),&#13;
which represents 98 percent of the total proposed project. This Annex describes the demand analysis&#13;
and the set of benefits and costs that have been considered in the economic evaluation, as well as the&#13;
assumptions adopted regarding key inputs, such as the value of time. Direct user benefits include travel&#13;
time, operating cost savings, and the investments avoided due to the proposed project; indirect&#13;
benefits arise from the reduction of negative externalities (accident and air pollution costs). Investment&#13;
costs comprise civil works, land expropriation, operational systems, rolling stock and project studies.&#13;
Both benefits and costs are defined as incremental compared to the situation without the project.&#13;
Throughout the analysis, and for illustrative purposes, the proposed investments were evaluated with&#13;
and without the accident and air pollution externalities. A more detailed description of the data and&#13;
assumptions supporting the economic evaluation summarized in this annex can be found in Reports&#13;
8 and 9 in the Project Files.&#13;
2.           This economic evaluation estimates the discounted expected present value of the&#13;
infrastructure investment's net benefits, the expected internal economic rates of return, as well as the&#13;
expected benefit/cost ratios for a set of discount rates, which includes the 1 0 percent discount rate,&#13;
which has been defined by SEAIN (Secretary of Planning for the Federative Republic of Brazil), as well&#13;
by its Commission of External Financing (COFIEX) for the project appraisal of foreign investments. In&#13;
addition, the sensitivity analysis included in this annex provides an idea of how the economic rates of&#13;
return would change due to deviations from the value of benefits and costs used in the base case. The&#13;
analysis is then complemented by a table of impacts of the project which are evaluated on a qualitative&#13;
basis.&#13;
B. Choice of a Project Base Case&#13;
3.           Mass Transit Options. Following current Bank policy recommendations for the appraisal&#13;
of mass transit investments contained in the Urban Transport Policy Paper IWorld Bank, 1 986) the&#13;
proposed investments were compared against two total segregated busways with regular buses and&#13;
a total segregated busways with articulated buses. In all cases, the analyses showed that the proposed&#13;
investments had a higher internal rate of return.&#13;
C. Demand Analysis&#13;
4.           Current Demand Levels. The peak-hour demand levels in the main avenues in the area&#13;

Demand Modelling&#13;
5.           The demand estimates used in the economic evaluation are the result of a simulation&#13;
of the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region transport network, performed with the Mantra System 4'&#13;
microcomputer program. The urban transport demand model used by this program is a classical&#13;
aggregate four-stage transport planning model, which comprises trip generation, trip distribution, modal&#13;
split, and trip assignment. This model estimates peak (6 hours) and off-peak (10 hours) periods of&#13;
public transport demand, which are assigned to bus and Metro lines.&#13;
6.           The model Mantra is integrated with a Geographic Information System, GisPlus. 6 In&#13;
order to use the model, it was necessary to create a GIS database for Belo Horizonte Metropolitan&#13;
Region, which comprises a Zoning layer and a Transport network layer (made up of line and node&#13;
layers). To develop the databases for the demand study, the team benefitted by the existence of&#13;
existing GIS software (APIC), managed by the municipality of Belo Horizonte.&#13;
7.           The zoning system adopted is based in the BH sub-regions, which were defined in the&#13;
Belo Horizonte Urban Development Plan and are already defined in the BH/APIC.GIS system. This layer&#13;
was exported by APIC and then imported by MANTRA.&#13;
8.           The present demand study used as primary data the 1993 Origin/Destination (ODI&#13;
survey performed by BHTRANS in all the bus lines in the BHMR. With the data, public transport&#13;
demand is available on a daily/hourly basis. Initially the OD survey was processed for each bus line.&#13;
The breakdown into peak and off-peak periods was done using information from BHTRANS. This&#13;
authority also provided information for each bus line on the number of passenger being transported per&#13;
hour of day. Peak hour periods considered were the following: 06:00 a.m. to 09:00 a.m. and 16:00&#13;
p.m. to 19:00 p.m. The number of trips in this period corresponds to 48 percent of the weekday&#13;
ridership.&#13;
9.           The OD matrix breakdown into trip purposes was based in a survey carried out by&#13;
CBTU/Belo Horizonte, showing that 80 percent of trips are commuting and business and 20 percent&#13;
are related to other trip purposes.&#13;
10.          The steps in the demand modelling exercise were:&#13;
(a)   Trip Generation. This step consists of the estimation of the number of trips&#13;
which will be produced by and attracted to the area of influence of the projects&#13;
considered in the study. In the present study it was conservatively assumed&#13;
that the 1 993 OD matrix is a good estimate up to the year 2001. After this&#13;
year, a yearly demand increase of 1 percent per year was considered. Car and&#13;
walking trips were not considered at all.&#13;
(b)   Trip Distribution. This step consists of the determination of the origin zone and&#13;
destination zone for each trip based on the types of trips produced by and&#13;
attracted to each zone and the interzonal "impedance" values (typically travel&#13;
times). Also in this case there is the assumption of using the current matrix as&#13;
an estimate up to the year 2001.&#13;
4/     Mantra Computer System was developed by Logit - Logistica Informatica e Transportes, Brazil, and SDG - Steer Davies&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

(c)   Modal Choice consists of the calculation of which trips will use the bus&#13;
network and the metro system. The Mantra model allows the competition&#13;
between single modes and combined modes. The modal choice model used is&#13;
the multinomial Logit model. It is important to point out that for each zone pair&#13;
of interest, for the area of influence of the Metro line, there will always be&#13;
competition between bus and metro+bus. The model utility functions&#13;
considered the same values of travel time used in the economic evaluation.&#13;
(d)   Trip assignment consists of the "loading" of the passenger trips onto the multi-&#13;
modal public transport network. The method used to assign the trips made&#13;
within each model, is the 'all or nothing' procedure, with no capacity restraint&#13;
iterations. The reason for this is the fact that car trips were not considered in&#13;
the present transport demand modelling exercise.&#13;
11.          The model was applied for the situation "without" and "with" the project, in both cases&#13;
using the Vilarinho - Eldorado link. The outputs obtained from the application of the model are the&#13;
number of trips, passenger-kms and passenger-hours by each individual mode: bus and metro. By&#13;
running the model for the situation "without" and "with," data were obtained on the additional trips&#13;
in the metro mode, and also the decrease in bus trips which result from the construction of the&#13;
proposed projects. The following paragraphs summarize the situation "without" and "with" project for&#13;
the above link and the results in terms of passenger-trips, passenger-kilometers, passenger-hours and&#13;
average speeds are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   Situation "Without Project" (Year 2001). The main traffic characteristics of the&#13;
study area in the situation "without" the project on a daily basis are: average&#13;
peak-hour bus speeds of 16.01 km/hour with a total of 1,565,597 passengers,&#13;
with 16,251,083 passenger-kms generated by bus trips with origins or&#13;
destinations in the BHMR. The corresponding number of passenger hours is&#13;
777,758. The metro trips generated for daily origins/destinations in the study&#13;
area a total of 113,895 passengers with 924,520 passenger-kms,&#13;
corresponding to 21,132 passenger-hours. The transit modal choice in terms&#13;
of trips generated by the study area would be 93.2 percent bus, and 6.8&#13;
percent metro.&#13;
(b)   Situation "With Project" (Year 2001). On a daily basis, the average peak-hour&#13;
bus speeds in the study area would rise to 16.26 km/h and daily demand for&#13;
bus transportation would go down to 1,356,656 passengers with 14,189,262&#13;
passenger-kms and 852,599 passenger-hours. The daily demand for metro trips&#13;
in the study area (with Eldorado - Vilarinho Link) will go up to a total of&#13;
322,832 passengers with 3,102,015 passenger-kms and 70,903 passenger-&#13;
hours. The transit modal choice will then be, in terms of passenger-kms, 80.8&#13;
percent bus, 19.2 percent metro.&#13;
1 2.         The demand estimates for the metro line in the year 2001 indicate: (a) a peak-hour&#13;
inbound volume of about 16,201 passengers; (b) a peak-hour outbound volume of 4,291 passengers;&#13;
(c) a total of about 2,033,841 week-day boardings; and (d) an annual ridership of more than 104&#13;
million passengers.&#13;

D. Benefits&#13;
Value of Time&#13;
13.          Mass transit projects can hardly be economically justified without accounting for the&#13;
real resource savings that economies of time represent. The monetary value of time by which the time&#13;
savings are multiplied to obtain the benefits from time savings is a key input in the economic evaluation&#13;
of the infrastructure components of this project. Individual values of time are traditionally considered&#13;
to be a function of income, in particular a function of the individual wage level. Thus, the value of time&#13;
used in the calculation of time savings is derived from the income distribution of users, disaggregated&#13;
by transport mode and trip purpose, and from information on wage levels. Table 9.2 shows the income&#13;
of public transport users in the zone of influence of the STU-BH and is disaggregated by mode. The&#13;
information was obtained from the Bus and CBTU surveys of their users conducted in 1 993.&#13;
14.          The base minimum wage used was R$70 which at the shadow price of foreign&#13;
exchange of 1 is equivalent to US$70. From this minimum wage base, the value of fringe benefits was&#13;
considered separate from payroll taxes. Fringe benefits in Brazil include vacation and the 1 3th month&#13;
of salary; both entail scaling the base salary by a factor of 1.25. Commuting and other purpose trips&#13;
are valued as a proportion of net wages. This implies subtracting direct taxes paid by the employee&#13;
from the base wage, which includes fringe benefits. The employee is subject to a payroll tax that varies&#13;
between 8 percent and 1 0 percent. In addition, the income tax should be subtracted. By assuming that&#13;
one-third of passengers are not tax-exempt and do not evade taxes, the net wage deflating factor will&#13;
be in the 0.92-0.88 range. An average factor of 0.9 was used. Business trips are valued at gross&#13;
wages, where fringe benefits and payroll taxes are taken into account. Payroll taxes in Brazil vary&#13;
between 38 percent and 45 percent and about 35 percent are paid by the employer. By combining&#13;
fringe benefits and employer contribution on payroll taxes, the base wage must be scaled by a factor&#13;
of 1.60 (1.25 plus 0.35).&#13;
1 5.         Hourly wages for each transport mode users are estimated by multiplying the individual&#13;
wage (in minimum wages) by the value of the minimum wage and dividing the result by 157, the&#13;
assumed average number of hours worked in a given month. Common practice in the appraisal of urban&#13;
transport projects is to use a proportion of the hourly wage rate to approximate the value of time&#13;
saved. This proportion as well as the wage rate base chosen for the calculation-whether gross or net&#13;
wages-depend on the type of trip. Three types of trip can be distinguished for the purposes of the&#13;
analysis: home-to-work trips (or commuting trips), work-related trips (or business trips), and non-work&#13;
related trips (or othertrips), for example shopping or visiting the doctor. Economic theory indicates that&#13;
both commuting trips and other trips should be valued as a proportion of the net wage. Empirical&#13;
evidence suggests that this proportion may vary between 20 and 100 percent. The value adopted in&#13;
the economic evaluation was a value of 1 7.5 percent based on a study undertaken a few years ago&#13;
for a similar city of the northeast with the same type of population. A 20 percent value was tested as&#13;
part of the sensitivity analysis. Economic theory also indicates that business trips during working hours&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

be valued at 100 percent of the gross wage rate.-' The resulting values of time used in the economic&#13;
evaluation are summarized in Table 9.3 and the proportion of passenger-hours spent travelling by type&#13;
of trip is summarized in Table 9.2.&#13;
Direct Benefits&#13;
1 6.          Direct benefits estimated in the economic evaluation are travel time savings, operating&#13;
cost savings, bus system control savings, and road maintenance cost savings:&#13;
(a)    Travel time savings result mainly from the transfer of bus passengers into the&#13;
new lines, and from existing metro and rail passengers who can save time in&#13;
their trips by taking advantage of the new transport facility. Travel time savings&#13;
also result from the increased operating speeds of the buses that continue&#13;
operation and, to a lesser extent, of car traffic. The program used to model the&#13;
demand works with an origin-destination matrix where the number of trips is&#13;
fixed. The number of "legs" comprising those trips may vary. When the new&#13;
link is introduced in the network, the modal split is affected and some trip&#13;
itineraries change. Thus, the demand model estimates the diverted demand, but&#13;
it does not estimate the so-called generated demand, that is, the additional&#13;
trips that will be potentially generated throughout the BHMR, but particularly&#13;
in the corridors directly affected by the investment. Omission of generated&#13;
demand yields a conservative level of demand and, consequently, results in a&#13;
lower rate of return. Travel time savings are measured for each mode by the&#13;
difference between the total number of morning peak passenger-hours spent&#13;
without the project and those spent with the project. These peak-hour&#13;
estimates are converted to annual values and then multiplied by the assumed&#13;
value of time to obtain a monetary value of time savings. The net change in&#13;
travel time across the four modes is considered to be the overall measure of&#13;
the travel time savings;&#13;
{[Pass-hr (w/o) - Pass-hr (w)I x VoT x PHF x ND} -- 1,000, where Pass-hr are&#13;
passenger-hours, VoT is the value of time, PHF is the peak-hour factor, and ND&#13;
is the number of operating days in a year.&#13;
(b)    Operating cost savings for the non-rail modes derive principally from the&#13;
improved commercial and traffic speeds, which can be achieved by buses and&#13;
cars, respectively. Operating cost savings are measured for each mode by the&#13;
difference between the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the&#13;
project and those carried with the project. All trips were considered irrespective&#13;
of their purpose. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual values and&#13;
then multiplied by the assumed values of operating cost per passenger-&#13;
kilometer for each mode to obtain a monetary value of operating cost savings.&#13;
The net change in operating costs across the four modes is considered to be&#13;
the overall measure of operating cost savings. Operating cost savings include&#13;
wages and salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures. An alternative&#13;
method to estimate these savings was to calculate the actual number of buses&#13;
6/    In developed countries, estimates of the value of time for journey to work ranges from 20 to 100 percent of the gross&#13;
wage rate. A recent review of the literature concludes that a reasonable average value of time for journey to work&#13;
is 50 percent of the gross wage rate. See Kenneth Small, Urban Transportation Economics, Harwood Academic&#13;

savings due to the elimination of the buses and reduction in bus kilometers&#13;
produced. Table 9.3 shows the calculations used.&#13;
{[Pass-km (wlo) x OC Iw/o)] - [Pass-km (w) x OC Iw)] x PHF x ND) - 1,000,&#13;
where OC are operating costs per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
(c)   Bus system control cost savings depend critically on the reduction of the bus&#13;
vehicle fleet, which is assumed to follow from the reduction in bus patronage&#13;
after the metro line opens. Bus system control cost savings are measured by&#13;
a given percentage (8 percent) of bus operating costs.&#13;
(d)   Road maintenance cost savings derive from the possibility of delaying periodic&#13;
maintenance mainly because of reduced bus traffic on the corridors under&#13;
consideration. The benefits from reduced vehicle operating costs resulting from&#13;
reduced pavement damage are not considered.&#13;
{[Pass-km (w/o) - Pass-km (w)] x RMC x PHF x ND} - 1,000 where RMC are&#13;
road maintenance cost savings per passenger-kilometer.&#13;
Indirect Benefits&#13;
1 7.         Indirect benefits arise from the reduction in externalities, such as accidents and air&#13;
pollution:&#13;
(a)   Accident cost savings are measured for each mode by the difference between&#13;
the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and those&#13;
carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are converted to annual&#13;
values and then multiplied by the assumed values of accident costs per 1,000&#13;
passenger-kilometer for each mode to obtain a monetary value of accident cost&#13;
savings. The net change in accident costs across the four modes is considered&#13;
to be the overall measure of accident cost savings. Accident costs include&#13;
property damage, injuries and loss of life.&#13;
{[(Pass-km (w/o)) - 1,000 - (Pass-km (w))-1,000] x ACC x PHF x ND}&#13;
1,000, where ACC are accident cost savings per 1000 passenger kilometer.&#13;
(b)   Air pollution cost savings are measured for bus and cars by the difference&#13;
between the morning peak passenger-kilometers carried without the project and&#13;
those carried with the project. These peak-hour estimates are deflated by the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy (to obtain costs per vehicle-kilometer) then&#13;
converted to annual values, and finally multiplied by the assumed values of air&#13;
pollution costs per vehicle-kilometer to obtain a monetary value of air pollution&#13;
cost savings. The air pollution factor (US$/gram) of emission reduction)&#13;
represents the total health and welfare benefits associated with the reduced&#13;
pollution emissions resulting from the proposed investments. Health benefits&#13;
include reduced morbidity and mortality whereas welfare benefits include the&#13;
reductions in soiling and corrosion of buildings and other structures. The net&#13;
change in air pollution costs in the bus and car modes is considered to be the&#13;
overall measure of air pollution cost savings. The set of air pollutants&#13;
considered include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides&#13;
(N0O), sulphur oxides (S0O) and fine particulate matter (PM 10).&#13;

APC are air pollution cost savings per passenger-kilometer and AOF is the&#13;
average vehicle occupancy factor.&#13;
E. Costs&#13;
18.          Investment Costs. Investment cost components were grouped for the economic&#13;
evaluation into land expropriations, civil works, operating systems, rolling stock, and costs of projects&#13;
and studies. Annex 8 contains a detailed breakdown of the capital cost structure. To obtain the&#13;
economic cost stream for both links, taxes were subtracted from the total costs (including physical and&#13;
price contingencies) shown in Annex 8 and multiplied by a shadow value factor of 0.9.&#13;
19.          Operating Costs. The incremental operating costs due to the investments are wages&#13;
and salaries, materials, energy and general expenditures (e.g., auditing, legal costs, transport, and&#13;
cleaning services).&#13;
20.          Discount Rate. In calculating the net present value for the underground and rail&#13;
integration components of the project a discount rate must be selected which represents the&#13;
opportunity cost of capital in Brazil. The discount rate used as "benchmark" by SEAIN (Secretary of&#13;
Planning) for foreign investments, as well as COFIEX (Commission of External Financing) is 10 percent.&#13;
F. Results of Economic Evaluation&#13;
21.          Internal economic rates of return (IERR), net present values (NPV), and Benefit/Cost&#13;
ratios (B/C) were calculated. The assumed project life is 25 years. Residual values were estimated at&#13;
the end of the project life for the civil works, operating systems and rolling stock. These residual values&#13;
were calculated following CBTU accounting procedures that assume a linear depreciation rate, which&#13;
vary according to the expected operational life of the components.&#13;
Distribution of Costs and Benefits&#13;
22.          Table 9.5 shows the annual series of expected benefits and costs for the proposed&#13;
project in the base case scenario.&#13;
Net Present Values&#13;
23.          The discounted expected present value of benefits for both investments net of costs,&#13;
are positive in the relevant range, which includes the discount rate of 10 percent are given in Table&#13;
9.5.&#13;
Internal Economic Rates of Return&#13;
24.          The estimated IERR for the base case is given in Table 9.5.&#13;
First-year Benefit Test&#13;
25.          A "first-year" benefit test was performed to assess whether the investments are&#13;
premature. Tables 9.7 show the results of the test for discount rates of 10 percent and 1 2 percent.&#13;
For both discount rates the proposed investments have benefits larger than the rate of discount&#13;
multiplied by the net present value of total investment costs in the planned year of start-up of&#13;
operations. This suggests that there are no additional net benefits to be gained if the implementation&#13;
of the project is delayed from the schedule assumed in the base case scenario.&#13;

Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
26.          A sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the variance of the IERR in relation&#13;
to the calculated value (base case) if deviations occur in the major benefit and cost components (travel&#13;
time savings, operating cost savings, wages and salaries, general expenditures, investment costs).&#13;
Table 9.6 shows the results.&#13;
Qualitative Analysis of the Infrastructure and Equipment Component&#13;
27.          Table 9.8 is an impact matrix which summarizes the impact of the proposed investment&#13;
on a number of aspects which could not be quantified in the standard benefit cost analysis.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
1.           Past Financial Performance. Since its beginning in 1986, STU-BH has depended upon&#13;
subsidies to meet its operating deficits, to service its debt, and to undertake capital investments. With&#13;
about 13 million trips in 1994, STU-BH received about US$14 million in operational subsidies that year&#13;
to cover its working expenditures of US$18.5 million. The resulting working ratio was thus 6.87 and&#13;
the internally generated revenues were barely enough to cover 1 5 percent of the working costs.&#13;
Personnel expenses were responsible for about 77 percent of the working costs with the parts and&#13;
materials costs equal to 11 percent of the working cost.7' The remainder of the working cost covered&#13;
administrative expense, energy cost, and other miscellaneous expenditures. The financial situation,&#13;
however, has improved compared to previous years when revenue-cost-coverage barely reached 11&#13;
percent during the best years.&#13;
2.           The basic reasons for such weak performance can be traced to: (a) a low tariff&#13;
structure; (b) lack of ridership; and (c) high personnel costs. In 1 994, farebox revenue per trip was only&#13;
US$0.22 compared to US$1.40 needed to cover the working costs. On the other hand, high working&#13;
costs compared to revenues can be blamed on under-utilization of the system since the current traffic&#13;
is only one-sixth of what the system was originally designed to carry. Low volumes of demand can be&#13;
partially explained due to the short length of the network since the originally planned network could&#13;
not be completed due to resource constraints. Had the anticipated demand materialized, working cost&#13;
coverage could have been about 65 percent given the current tariff structure. That would have been&#13;
in line with most of the systems of this type.&#13;
3.           STU-BH's cost structure is dominated by high fixed costs made up of personnel which&#13;
amounted to 77 percent of working cost in 1994. At a level of production of 3 million car/km per year&#13;
in 1994, car-km per employee excluding administration were 7.7 which is on the low side given the&#13;
age and the length of the system. Similarly, working cost per car-km also was high at US$6.2&#13;
compared to less than US$4.0 observed in the case of more efficient systems, and hence points to&#13;
high cost of labor in the total cost structure. However, STU-BH has made extensive efforts to improve&#13;
throughput and the car-km/operational employee have increased every year since 1 989. Likewise cost&#13;
performance has improved during 1 990-1 994 in relation to the total car-km operated.&#13;
4.           On the revenue side, farebox revenues are the main source of internally generated funds&#13;
which have traditionally been insufficient to cover working costs. Reliance on extra operational sources&#13;
such as rental income and revenue from selling advertisement is marginal. STU-BH, however, has&#13;
collaborated with the private sector to develop some of its stations (e.g., Minas Shopping) but these&#13;
joint ventures have been so far restricted to capital investments. These joint-ventures have helped STU-&#13;
BH improve the network without using its own capital budget and should be fostered.&#13;
5.           Financial Projections. Completion of the new capital projects will expand STU-BH's&#13;
operations by almost 67 percent-from 16.8 km to 28.1 km in length. Growth in demand is expected&#13;
to be even higher since besides the increased size of the network, the new system will operate with&#13;
shorter headway and a higher number of integrated stations. The bus routes will be redesigned by&#13;
7/    Actual material cost was some what higher than uss 1,952 thousand in 1994 since under the Brazilian law repairs with&#13;
life expectancy of more than one year are treated as capital expense. Nonetheless, given the age and size of the&#13;
current system a substantially higher number is not likely.&#13;

6.           Projected costs and revenues show a continuing improvement in cost recovery as the&#13;
current investment program of expanding the network is first implemented until the Sao Paulo terminal&#13;
followed by another extension of about 6.5 km to Vilarinho. By 2001, one year after the last of the&#13;
scheduled capital programs is completed, total revenues (operating + non-operating) are projected to&#13;
cover all of working costs. The increase in the cost coverage is achieved by a 1,618 percent&#13;
improvement in operating revenues versus a 1 63 percent increase in working costs. The total revenue&#13;
during this period is projected to increase by about 991 percent.&#13;
7.           Between 1995-2001, STU-BH's operating revenues are expected to increase by 61&#13;
percent annually largely because of new demand resulting from the extension of the network, better&#13;
integration between bus lines and the metro system as well as a 73 percent increase in the value of&#13;
average tariff-from US$0.28 (1995) to US$0.50 (2001). Non-operational income made up from the&#13;
rental of advertisement space and rental of properties is also expected to increase every year from&#13;
1 995 until it is about 5 percent of the operational income by the year 2001. From there on, it is&#13;
expected to maintain similar participation in the total revenue.&#13;
8.           Operating expenses are also expected to increase during 1995-2001 period but at a&#13;
lower rate than revenues. Working costs are expected to increase at about 1 7 percent annually. The&#13;
slower rate of operating expenses is justified on the basis of the current system having very low ratio&#13;
of variable cost to fixed cost: the number of employees is expected to double during 1995-2001&#13;
whereas total traffic is expected to increase eight times during this period. Furthermore, average tariff&#13;
is projected to increase at more than twice the rate of increase in personnel cost. On the other hand,&#13;
spare parts and materials costs are expected to increase by 30 percent every year between 1 994-2001&#13;
in order to replenish current low levels of inventory.&#13;
9.           Financial ForecastAssumptions. The financial forecasts are based on March 1995 US$.&#13;
To develop the financial forecast, the following major assumptions have been considered in addition&#13;
to STU-BH's past financial performance.&#13;
During the period 1994-2001, demand is expected to increase with the&#13;
commencement of operations to the following stations by the end of the respective&#13;
years: (a) Santa Inos in 1995; (b) Minas Shopping in 1996; (c) Sao Paulo in 1997; (d)&#13;
Heli6polis in 1998; (e) Laranjeiras in 1999; and (f) Vilarinho in 2000. Accordingly,&#13;
traffic would increase as these stations open. Starting in 2002, traffic is expected to&#13;
grow at 1 percent per annum;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                              ANNEX 10&#13;
*     Tariffs are expected to increase in real terms during 1 995-2005. Average tariff is&#13;
expected to increase by 73 percent between 1996-2001 and another 11 percent&#13;
during 2001-2005. Since average tariff is derived after discounting for promotional and&#13;
incentive tickets, integrated tickets, and multi-passes, the selling prices of tickets (face-&#13;
value) may be different from the average tariff;&#13;
*      Students are expected to pay half of the full fare ticket. The other half will be&#13;
compensated to STU-BH by the government along with the compensation for gratuitos&#13;
based on the full face-value of one-way tickets;&#13;
*     Non-operational incomes is expected to be about 5 percent of the operational income&#13;
by 2001, including income from advertisement. These results are similar to those&#13;
observed in other rapid transit systems;&#13;
Personnel expenses are expected to rise by 3 percent during the projection period. This&#13;
is in addition to the increase in the personnel cost due to added employment.&#13;
*      Energy cost is assumed to vary in direct proportion to car-km during the projection&#13;
period.&#13;
*      Spare and material cost is expected increase at 20 percent more than the change in&#13;
car-km to enhance their participation in the working costs. The increased expenses&#13;
associated with materials is in response to currently low maintenance expenditure.&#13;
10.          Sensitivity Analysis. The financial forecast is most likely to be affected by changes in&#13;
total revenue due to: (a) STU-BH's inability to raise the average tariff above the level of 1994; (b)&#13;
delays in the construction of new projects, especially the proposed Sao Paulo - Vilarinho line; and (c)&#13;
less-than-expected growth in traffic volume. The financial forecast assumes an increase in the average&#13;
tariff of 54 percent between 1995-2001; however, STU-BH may find it difficult to raise tariffs in real&#13;
term beyond the expected increase to US$0.39 in order to match the prevailing bus tariff. Maintaining&#13;
the average tariff at US$0.36 would cost the state treasury an additional US$73 million in operational&#13;
subsidies (not including depreciation) between 1997-2005 and would increase the working ratio in&#13;
2001 to 1.35 (instead of 1.05).&#13;
11.          Assuming there is a delay of one year in the completion of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho&#13;
section, average annual subsidy during 1995-2005 would increase from US$8.8 million to US$11&#13;
million. Similarly, year 2001 working ratio would worsen to 2.31 but would bounce back to near 1.00&#13;
due largely to new traffic the following year. Similarly, less-than-estimated traffic volumes realized&#13;
during 2001-2005 would adversely effect the profitability of STU-BH. Assuming that the realized traffic&#13;
during 2001-2005 is 20 percent less than the forecast, working ratio in 2001 will worsen to 1.31 and&#13;
will cost the state treasury an additional US$52 million in subsidies.&#13;
12.          Further, to assess a possible decrease in revenue, additional sensitivity tests were&#13;
based on increasing the working costs. An increase of 20 percent in the working costs over those&#13;
projected under the base case show similar results to those observed in the case of a fall in revenue,&#13;
that is, working ratio worsens, in this case to 1.26 in year 2001. However, as the underestimation in&#13;
costs would be uniform over the years, the state will need to put in an additional US$75 million in&#13;
subsidies. In the worst of all cases, if all of the above mentioned scenarios are realized, working ratio&#13;
in 2001 would worsen to 3.45 and the cost coverage would decrease to 29 percent. This&#13;
performance, although very pessimistic, would still be better than the 1994 financial results.&#13;
&#13;

13.          On the other hand, the project could benefit from a reduction in employment due to&#13;
possible outsourcing of services. While no comparisons were made of the cost of outsourcing versus&#13;
in-house provision of services such as maintenance, ticket sales, security, etc., it is assumed that the&#13;
costs realized through outsourcing would be at the most as much as the provision of these service in-&#13;
house. Any savings, therefore, would further improve the financial performance of STU-BH.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
BELO HORIZONTE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONITORING, EVALUATION&#13;
AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
A. Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.           The implementation schedule for individual components are shown in Annex 8. Those&#13;
schedules and the detailed cost tables of Annex 8 provide the basis for project monitoring and for the&#13;
disbursement prc,file.&#13;
2.           The project would consist of three inter-related parts. Part A comprises two main&#13;
works: (a) the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link; and (b) the access works to the stations. Part B comprises&#13;
two studies and one civil work: (a) the inspection/maintenance study; (b) the traffic management,&#13;
safety and control study; and (c) the acquisition and installation of the centralized traffic control. Part&#13;
C comprises a series of studies described in detail in Annex 7.&#13;
3.          Implementation Monitoring. CBTU will monitor compliance with the individual&#13;
implementation schedules by defining target dates for key actions. The target dates for key actions for&#13;
the first two years of the project (to about mid-1997) are shown in the Action Plan in this Annex. In&#13;
November of each year CBTU will prepare, with the agreement of the Bank, a similar action plan for&#13;
the following year of implementation, and so on throughout the life of the project. In the event of&#13;
delays, CBTU will be responsible for identification of the constraints and for devising and executing&#13;
policies to resolve problems.&#13;
4.           Financial progress will be monitored by CBTU in the same manner as implementation&#13;
progress. Estimates of costs of Part A have been made but final costs will be dependent on&#13;
consultants' final engineering designs and on bid prices (for equipment etc.). Thus, it will be the&#13;
responsibility of CBTU to update cost schedules as contracts and bids are finalized and to monitor&#13;
financial progress in relation to the updated schedules.&#13;
5.           CBTU will report on both implementation and financial progress in the biannual progress&#13;
reports.&#13;
6.           Evaluation of Part A of the project will attempt to determine the extent to which original&#13;
construction schedules and costs are respected.&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Components&#13;
7.           Monitoring would identify the physical, institutional and financial status of each&#13;
subproject component, as appropriate, on a periodic basis. The aim would be to identify implementa-&#13;
tion problems and the extent of deviation from the targets proposed at appraisal. The results of the&#13;
monitoring program (the comparison of achieved performance with appraisal targets) will be presented&#13;
in the biannual Progress Reports prepared and coordinated by CBTU. The results of each subcomponent&#13;
monitoring program will provide the basis and information for implementing agencies to prepare&#13;
measures and actions to resolve implementation problems, if any, and at the same time, to update&#13;
project costs, disbursement and implementation schedules if necessary. Monitoring indicators to be&#13;
employed will vary by type of component but the general guidelines are set out in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-                               ANNEX 11&#13;
8.           The general guidelines given below would be followed:&#13;
(a)   each implementing agency would prepare, as part of its component preparation&#13;
report, an implementation schedule which sets out target dates for key actions&#13;
for physical works, equipment supply and institutional components. Where&#13;
components are not fully prepared at appraisal, it would be a condition of their&#13;
subsequent inclusion that an implementation schedule be prepared as an&#13;
integral part of the component;&#13;
(b)   for physical works (and equipment) progress the implementation schedule will&#13;
define target dates (to the nearest quarter) for the start and finish of key&#13;
actions involved in the implementation of physical works (and supply of&#13;
equipment). Thus indicators are likely to include:&#13;
(i)    start/finish dates for final engineering design and documents for works&#13;
(or equipment);&#13;
(ii)   date of issue of bid documents;&#13;
(iii)  date of contract signature; and&#13;
(iv)   start/finish dates for works (or supply of equipment).&#13;
(c)   for financial performance since works (or supply of equipment) are likely to&#13;
extend over some time, the component implementation schedule will also be&#13;
required to give target "percentage completed" by quarter. Thus target&#13;
expenditures can be estimated and will be used to monitor financial&#13;
(disbursement) performance on a quarterly basis;&#13;
(d)   for institutional measures (technical assistance, training and studies), the&#13;
monitoring targets will be the progress reports and the dates of completion&#13;
indicated in the implementation plan of Annex 7; and&#13;
(e)   monitoring of resettlement and property values in the area of influence of the&#13;
STU-BH before, during and after construction.&#13;
9.           Ex-post evaluation would be aimed at determining the effectiveness and efficiency of&#13;
measures in meeting the objectives determined at appraisal. In the event that objectives are not met&#13;
and previously anticipated improvements in performance are not achieved, the data would be used:&#13;
(a) to identify why components had not been fully successful; and (b) to modify future components&#13;
proposed for subsequent implementation which were based on similar premises. Furthermore, the ex-&#13;
post evaluation would be used as a major input to the Project Implementation Report.&#13;
10.          Quantitative performance targets have been established for STU-BH and are shown&#13;
below.&#13;
Table 111.1: Quantitative Performance Targets for STU-BH&#13;

- 94 -                              ANNEX 11&#13;
11.          The qualitative monitoring indicators will be: (a) the date of the establishment of the&#13;
Regional Transport Coordination Commission as compared to the agreed date in Section IV of the main&#13;
text and its effectiveness in meeting the basic objectives described in Annex 3; (b) the completion of&#13;
a financing mechanisms study and an action plan to carry out its recommendations which should take&#13;
place before the Mid-term Project Review; (c) the pace of the implementation of the bus integration&#13;
plan after the entry into operation of each link of the Sao Paulo - Vilarinho link and the completion of&#13;
any of the proposed accesses to the stations of the Eldorado - Sao Paulo link; this should be done no&#13;
later than 30 days after the entry of operation of the link or stations; and (d) the results of a train user&#13;
survey, to be carried out every two years after effectiveness until project completion, by an&#13;
independent firm, to gauge the satisfaction of the users with the level of service offered by the system.&#13;
All the above qualitative monitoring indicators would be rated on a scale of 0 (unsatisfactory) to 5&#13;
(excellent).&#13;
12.          Bank Supervision. The main emphasis during the initial project phase would be to: (a)&#13;
review the development and implementation of the project monitoring system; (b) make certain that&#13;
CBTU's staff is familiar with Bank procurement guidelines, Bank disbursement procedures (i.e., Special&#13;
Account transactions), and Bank independent auditing requirements; (c) ensure that all steps towards&#13;
decentralization of STU-BH to the State are being taken; and (d) help CBTU/RTCC's development of&#13;
a strategy to properly promote the project to the BHMR public. Many of these items would be&#13;
addressed in the first supervision mission scheduled for November 1995. During project&#13;
implementation, the supervision missions would need to conduct the following activities in the field&#13;
on a regular basis in addition to monitoring project progress: (a) review a sampling of contract bids&#13;
and awards; (b) inspect disbursement procedures and record-keeping; (c) inspect adequacy of&#13;
supervision and monitoring of the implementing agencies and respective subprojects; (d) review&#13;
performance and accuracy of the Project Monitoring System; and (e) complete a Mid-term Review 24&#13;
months after project effectiveness to examine the progress made, especially in the Integrated Land&#13;
Use, Urban Transport, and Air Quality Strategy and policies to assess the relevance of project&#13;
objectives and actions, and recommend appropriate revisions (as needed). Supervision missions in the&#13;
field should attempt to visit all the agencies dealing with the project during each trip. A preliminary&#13;
schedule of supervision missions including key activities is indicated in the table on the following page.&#13;
The key activities shown are in addition to the regular supervision needs, which include a review of:&#13;
(a) progress reports; (b) procurement issues; (c) disbursements; (d) Project Implementation Plan; (e)&#13;
project costs; (f) yearly independent audits; (g) correspondence; and (h) unforeseen issues.&#13;
13.          The Bank project team would consist of the Task Manager (Sr. Transport Plan-&#13;
ner/Economist), a Railway Engineer, a Metro Infrastructure Specialist, a Resettlement Specialist and&#13;
a Financial Analyst. Consultants are anticipated to be required on a short-term basis to assist in specific&#13;
areas, such as analysis of monitoring system, and review of institutional development programs.&#13;
Supervision requirements for the project are expected to be high due to: (a) the complexity of the&#13;
institutional arrangements; (b) the anticipated large number of small-scale subprojects; and (c) the&#13;
institutional weakness of CBTU (requiring significant training and technical assistance). Supervision&#13;
requirements are anticipated to be about 20 staff-weeks during the first year and about 12-1 5 staff-&#13;
weeks thereafter. A summary of key inputs is provided on the following page.&#13;
14.          Borrower's Contribution to Supervision. CBTU is expected to: (a) be responsible for&#13;
project monitoring and coordination, to keep the Project Monitoring System accurate, and to follow-up&#13;
and address all issues which are "signaled" by the system; (b) be responsible for properly managing&#13;
all procurement and disbursement considerations, keeping procurement and disbursement records up&#13;
to date; (c) prepare progress reports in June and December of each year; and (d) be responsible for&#13;
coordinating arrangements for the Bank supervision missions.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan
            Transport Decentralization Project will: (a) develop an
            integrated urban transport system for the Belo Horizonte
            Metropolitan Region (BHMR) under a Regional Transportation
            Coordination Commission (RTCC) established to coordinate and
            recommend common policies on pricing, regulation, financing,
            project evaluation and selection; (b) the completion and
            decentralization of the Belo Horizonte Subdivision of the
            Brazilian Urban Train Company (STU-BH) from the federal to
            the state and municipal levels; (c) the reduction of the
            environmental (mainly air quality and noise) impacts on the
            BHMR due to motor vehicles and the promotion of
            non-motorized transport modes; and (d) the development of
            special strategies and actions to improve the accessibility
            of the low-income population to employment centers, health
            and education facilities.
