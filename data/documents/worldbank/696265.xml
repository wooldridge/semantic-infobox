Note No.88   Railway Concessions-Heading Down&#13;
the Right Track in Argentina&#13;
Jose Carbajo and   Argentina privatized many of its railway services by concession contract during the early 1990s.&#13;
Antonio Estache    The reforms have been remarkable for their speed and innovation-despite the complexity of the&#13;
issues and the lack of "off-the-shelf" models to follow at the time. The overall result has been&#13;
positive. Many services have improved. Traffic has grown-up about 180 million passenger trips a&#13;
year. Subsidies have been cut dramatically-down from US$2 billion or so a year to a little more&#13;
than US$100 million. But as with any complex reform, there is an unfinished agenda. And with&#13;
the Argentine approach becoming a model for other countries in Latin America, this review of the&#13;
lessons starting to emerge from the reform experience is a timely one.&#13;
