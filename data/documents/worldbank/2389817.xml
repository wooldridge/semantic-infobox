                     Releaseof the Second Tranche     - Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. The Fiscal Federalism and Regional Fiscal Reform Loan (FF&amp;RFRL) for Russia was&#13;
approved by the World Bank's Board of Directors on January 29, 2002, in the amount of&#13;
US$120 million and the first tranche of US$38 million was disbursed in two installments on&#13;
October 10, 2002 (US$19.4 million) and December 19, 2002 (US$18.6 million); the front-&#13;
end fee (US$1.2 million) was withdrawn on June 5, 2002. The remaining US$80.8 million is&#13;
to be disbursed in two equal tranches with two installments each: (i) a second tranche&#13;
expected to be released in the second and fourth quarters of 2003, and (ii) a third tranche&#13;
expected to be released in the second and fourth quarters of 2004.&#13;
&#13;
2. The conditions for the second tranche (US$40 million) - consisting of full compliance&#13;
with specific tranche conditions, on-track implementation of the reform program, and&#13;
satisfactory macroeconomic performance - have now been fulfilled. The use of the proceeds&#13;
of the first tranche was in conformity with the channeling arrangement set out in the note to&#13;
the Board on "Russia - Controls over Adjustment Loan Disbursements", dated December 9,&#13;
1999; it is expected that the same procedures will be applied to the second and the third&#13;
tranches.&#13;

&#13;
                                     I.        Background&#13;
&#13;
3. The Russian Federation has a population of some 143 million people and covers a vast&#13;
land area of 17,075 thousand square kilometers (almost twice the size of Canada, the next&#13;
largest country in terms of land mass). There are 89 Subjects of the Russian Federation&#13;
(oblasts, republics, krays, autonomous okrugs, and one autonomous oblast, as well as the&#13;
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg) that form the second tier of government. The third tier&#13;
is formed by local governments - urban and rural municipalities (very often rural and urban&#13;
areas are combined in one municipality, also in practice one urban municipality may be a part&#13;
of another) with some degree of fiscal autonomy, and some small towns, settlements, and&#13;
villages with no fiscal autonomy at all. There are large differences among the regions in&#13;
terms of climate, endowments, and economic base that make effective fiscal and economic&#13;
management at the national level quite complex. Although the system inherited after the&#13;
disintegration of the USSR is federative according to the Constitution, in practice, formal&#13;
relations between levels of government have been more like those based on a highly&#13;
centralized, unitary government.&#13;
&#13;
4. In 1998 the Government adopted the Concept of Reform of Inter-Governmental Fiscal&#13;
Relations in the Russian Federation for 1999-2001, which was created and has been&#13;
managed by the Working Group for Improvement of Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations,&#13;
including representation from the Government, the Duma and the Council of the Federation.&#13;
The Concept laid out a three-year strategy for the reform of intergovernmental finance. A key&#13;
feature of this strategy was for the federal government to take an active role in stabilizing and&#13;
to some extent standardizing the system of intergovernmental relations. Since Mr. Putin was&#13;
sworn in as President in May 2000 the political situation has solidified. A more cooperative&#13;
relationship between Duma and the President has developed. To further curtail the powers of&#13;
the 89 regional governors, Mr. Putin initiated (and managed to pass through both chambers&#13;
of Parliament) legislative changes which no longer gave governors automatic representation&#13;
in the upper House of the Federal Parliament (Council of the Federation), and giving him the&#13;
right to dismiss the governors when they violate federal laws. In August 2001, the&#13;
Government approved a new program of reforms for the system of fiscal federalism for&#13;
2002-2005.&#13;
&#13;
5. The objectives of the Government's reform program are stated in the Fiscal Federalism&#13;
Development Program for 2002-2005 (approved by Government Resolution #584 on August&#13;
15th, 2001). The Government's            commitment     to   the objectives of        improving&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal relations and reforming sub-national public finance under the loan&#13;
was confirmed by the First Deputy Finance Minister in a Letter of Development Policy to the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank "On the Main Areas of the Regional Fiscal Reform Process in the Russian Federation&#13;
for the Period up to 2005", dated November 28, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
6. The overall reform program is clearly on track: previously unfunded federal mandates&#13;
have been phased out, a more advanced equalization formula has been adopted, 100 percent&#13;
of the personal income tax was assigned to the regions, regions were provided with the sales&#13;
tax for which they could set a tax rate and with the share of profit tax where they can vary the&#13;
tax rate within the boundaries, tax and expenditure assignments became more transparent and&#13;
amendments to existing legislation on clear division of responsibilities between different&#13;
levels of government (which in general are in line with international practice) were drafted&#13;
by the Presidential Administration and are currently under consideration in the Duma. In&#13;
general, the federal government has chosen a road of a more centralized control over&#13;
subnational budgets with less discretion of subnational authorities over their expenditures.&#13;
Thus, in addition to the equalization fund, several new targeted transfer windows have been&#13;
created within the federal budget. The most important are: Compensation Fund to fund law&#13;
on disabled and child allowances, Social Co-financing Fund to finance part of housing&#13;
subsidies. As a result, equalization transfers in the 2002 federal budget are almost equal to&#13;
non-equalizing transfers.&#13;
&#13;
7. Consistent with the objectives contained in the Government's program, the FF&amp;RFRL&#13;
seeks to strengthen the system of fiscal federalism and to support the regions of the Russian&#13;
Federation in the development and implementation of fiscal reform programs that will&#13;
promote financial transparency, budgetary accountability, and strengthened fiscal&#13;
management policies and practices at the regional level. The FF&amp;RFRL is designed to&#13;
deepen reforms in the following areas: (i) budget process; (ii) tax policy; (iii) expenditure&#13;
management; (iv) the intergovernmental system within region; (v) debt management; and (vi)&#13;
information and audit.&#13;
&#13;
8. The mechanism agreed with the borrower to promote reform at the regional level is the&#13;
Regional Fiscal Reform Fund (RFRF) - a transfer window within the federal budget that&#13;
provides transfers to regions who present competitive reform programs and implement them.&#13;
&#13;
9. The companion technical assistance project - Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (RFTAP, Loan No. 4528-RU) - continues to be available to assist the Government&#13;
and participating regions in implementing their reform programs. This project is being&#13;
implemented satisfactorily.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Government to support their fiscal federalism reform program by funding a E5 million&#13;
10.The U.K. Department for International Development (DflD) responded to a request from&#13;
&#13;
technical assistance facility in April 2002, which assists in the implementation of the&#13;
FF&amp;RFRL. This facility comprises a "resource center" to assist regions to compete for&#13;
resources from the RFRF, support for additional analytical work on fiscal federalism and an&#13;
advisor on regional finance issues to the Ministry of Finance (MoF).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         11.         Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
 11.The main economic indicators continued to exhibit favorable albeit slowing trends in&#13;
 2002. Real GDP has grown by 4.3 percent, bringing the cumulative post-crisis growth over&#13;
 1999-2002 to more than 25 percent; the overall budget surplus amounted to 1.4 percent of&#13;
 GDP on a cash basis; and the trade surplus for the year was equal to US$45.4 billion,&#13;
 pushing up the Central Bank's reserves to US$48 billion. In 2002 Russia's stock and bond&#13;
 markets were, for the second consecutive year, among the best performing in the world.&#13;
 Russia's external debt trades at yields that are lower than those of other countries with&#13;
 similar credit ratings, although rating agencies made a series of upgrades in 2002 (see&#13;
 paragraph 20 below).&#13;
&#13;
 12. An analysis of different scenarios for oil price developments suggests that Russia's fiscal&#13;
 and Balance of Payment (BOP)positions are likely to remain sustainable even if oil prices&#13;
fall substantially below present levels. Russia could ensure a primary budget surplus without&#13;
incurring overall budget deficit even if the price for Urals crude falls to US$18.5/bbl in 2003-&#13;
 2004. Indeed, energy prices would have to fall and remain at US$12/bbl for Urals for the&#13;
next two years (without a change in net capital outflows) to create fiscal and BOPgaps. Only&#13;
a sustained and deep drop in energy prices would likely result in significant financing needs.&#13;
&#13;
 13.However, the medium and long-term prospects for sustaining today's growth rates still&#13;
remain overly dependent on volatile natural resource prices, as productivity growth lags&#13;
behind real exchange rate appreciation and real wage increase, capital outflows remain high&#13;
(although decreasing), and the growth rates of investment have slowed significantly. Overall,&#13;
the economy's assets remain concentrated in the extractive industries, with exports almost&#13;
entirely dependent on natural resources. Despite the increase in overall medium and long-&#13;
term lending to the private sector, domestic bank credit still plays an insignificant role in&#13;
financing capital formation by Russian enterprises and investment remains dominated by the&#13;
natural resource and the budgetary sectors. To overcome all these impediments to sustainable&#13;
growth, the Governmeht embarked on a comprehensive structural reform program:&#13;
restructuring natural monopolies, housing and community services reform, pension reform,&#13;
public administration and civil service reform. The Government has maintained a good&#13;
record in designing and pushing reform enabling legislation through the Duma in 2002. This&#13;
momentum is likely to be maintained and reinforced in 2003 as the Government currently&#13;
discusses approval of a Medium Term Program with special emphasis on diversification of&#13;
the economy.&#13;
&#13;
14.Industrial Growth: Supported by domestic demand, with consumption becoming&#13;
increasingly important, output continued to grow in 2002. Growth in industrial output&#13;
amounted to 3.7 percent for 2002. In 2002 growth accelerated in "export oriented" industries&#13;
(ferrous and non-ferrous metals, fuel and energy, wood and processing)- to 5.5 percent&#13;
(weighted average) from 4.2 percent in 2001, while growth in industries that primarily&#13;
produce for the domestic market (electricity, chemical, machine building, construction&#13;
materials, light and food industry) decelerated to 2.5 percent, down from 6.3 percent the&#13;
previous year. Negative rates of growth were registered in electricity (-0.7 percent) and light&#13;
industry (-3.4 percent).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 15.Inflation and Money: Inflation remained at moderate levels, with a year on year CPI&#13;
increase for the year 2002 of 15.1percent. The Central Bank (CBR) has been continuing its&#13;
rapid accumulation of reserves in 2002, with reserves increasing from US$36 billion at the&#13;
end of 2001 to US$48 billion at the end of 2002, while preventing nominal appreciation at&#13;
the same time. By end April 2003 CBR increased reserves to US$60 billion, while the ruble&#13;
has appreciated in nominal terms against the dollar by about 4 percent in the first four months&#13;
of 2003.&#13;
&#13;
 16.Exchange Rate and Terms of Trade:The sharp appreciation of the Euro against the dollar&#13;
in the second half of 2002 caused Russia's real effective exchange rate (REER) of the ruble&#13;
to depreciate by 0.7 percent, the first real depreciation since 1998. Cumulative appreciation&#13;
of the REER exceeded 46 percent since end 1998 (to approximately 20 percent below pre-98&#13;
level). At the same time, the average monthly trade surplus fell from US$5.1 billion in 2000&#13;
to US$4.2 billion in 2001, and to US$3.8 billion in 2002. While the large trade surplus has&#13;
facilitated CBR's reserve build up and the servicing of foreign debt, net capital outflows have&#13;
continued to be high, although decreased in 2002 to estimated US$11 billion (down from&#13;
US$16 billion in 2001, and US$22 billion in 2000). Russia's foreign investment position&#13;
remained negative in 2002, with total investment to Russia increasing by 38.7 percent to&#13;
US$19.8 billion, while Russian companies invested US$19.9 billion abroad. FDI, however,&#13;
grew by only 0.6 percent, while other investments (portfolio investment and trade credits)&#13;
grew by 56 percent, up to US$15.3 billion- the strongest indicator of an increased willingness&#13;
to finance business in Russia despite continuing problems with corporate governance and the&#13;
business environment.&#13;
&#13;
17.Budget: According to the Ministry of Finance data, the Federal budget reported revenues&#13;
&#13;
percent, and the overall surplus to 1.4percent of GDP on a cash basis. On December 29, the&#13;
of 17.1 percent of GDP in 2002. The primary surplus (IMF definition) amounted to 3.8&#13;
Budget Law for 2003 was signed by the President, after approvals by the Duma (the lower&#13;
chamber of the Parliament) and by the Federation Council (the upper chamber of the&#13;
Parliament). The Federal budget 2003 envisages continuation of the sound macroeconomic&#13;
policy of generating budget surpluses in 2000-2002.&#13;
&#13;
18.Income, Poverty and Labor Market Indicators: Russia's recent economic performance&#13;
has had a beneficial impact on wage incomes and social transfers. According to preliminary&#13;
estimates, real disposable income grew by 8.8 percent in 2002, slightly faster than in 2001.&#13;
For the third year in a row, real income grew faster than the economy, a reflection of the&#13;
favorable balance of trade and continued shift from profit to wage incomes. Real wages grew&#13;
by 16.6 percent, after 19.9 percent increase in 2001, indicating that wage growth outpaces&#13;
other components of real disposable income. In the wake of the substantial real appreciation&#13;
of the ruble in 1999-2001, the average monthly dollar wage increased by 27 percent in 2002&#13;
to almost US$141. In December of 2002, the average monthly dollar wage was US$185,&#13;
approaching the record level of US$205 recorded in December 1997. The share of the&#13;
population with incomes below the subsistence level (R1800, or about US$57, per month for&#13;
2002) fell from 27.3 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2002. The unemployment rate, reported&#13;
by Goskomstat (ILO definition) declined steadily from 10.4 percent at the end-2000 to 8.7&#13;
percent at the end-2001, and 7.1 percent at the end-2002.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 19. Creditworthiness: Russia's positive macroeconomic performance resulted in several&#13;
upgrades by rating agencies. In a series of upgrades Moody's raised Russia's sovereign risk&#13;
from B2 to BA2 (with "stable" outlook), and Standard and Poor's- from B to BB (with&#13;
"stable" outlook). Aside from good fiscal performance and large trade surpluses, rating&#13;
agencies emphasized political stability, progress in macroeconomic management, the&#13;
implementation of tax reform and the level of foreign reserves which should enhance&#13;
Russia's debt service capability. However, Russia's ratings remain below the investment&#13;
grade and consequently will not lead to major portfolio adjustments among investors abroad.&#13;
&#13;
20. In sum, the present macroeconomic framework is satisfactory for disbursement from the&#13;
FF&amp;RFR loan at this time. The IMF concurs with this assessment.&#13;
&#13;
                    111.       Progress Against TrancheRelease Criteria&#13;
&#13;
21. The release of the second tranche is contingent, pursuant to section 2.02 (d) of the Loan&#13;
Agreement, upon progress satisfactory to Bank with respect to: (i) implementation of the&#13;
reform program as set forth in the Letter of Development Policy dated November 28, 2001;&#13;
(ii) maintaining a macroeconomic policy framework that is consistent with the objectives of&#13;
the program; and (iii) the specific conditions described in Schedule 3 and Annex to Schedule&#13;
3 of the Loan Agreement. Progress in terms of the macroeconomic framework is described in&#13;
paras. 11-21 above.&#13;
&#13;
22. Progress in carrying out the program continues to be satisfactory, and there has been no&#13;
reversal of the actions taken in compliance with the first tranche of this Loan. In addition to&#13;
meeting the specific tranche conditions, described below, the participating regions&#13;
demonstrated substantial progress in reforming all core areas as outlined in the Letter of&#13;
Development Policy, including extension of coverage of the budget and improvement of the&#13;
clarity and methods of budget process; systematization of tax policy in regions so that it is&#13;
discourages arrears; improvement of overall use, allocation and mechanics of budget&#13;
expenditure; improvement in clarity and predictability of resource flows between regions and&#13;
local governments; improvement of the information base and management of debt; adoption&#13;
of adequate auditing of the use of public resources. The highlights of recent reform progress&#13;
in the regions are described in the core conditions 4 and 5.&#13;
&#13;
23. In general, the FF&amp;RFR design has proven to provide sufficient incentives for regions to&#13;
prepare and implement high quality reform programs. At this stage, a total of 24 regions have&#13;
presented applications and reform programs to the RFRF under the FF&amp;RFR. There are six&#13;
specific conditions for the second tranche, as specified in the Schedule 3 of the Loan&#13;
Agreement. All six conditions have been met, as described below:&#13;
24. Condition Nd.The RFRF is continuing to operate in accordance with procedures&#13;
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank as provided for under the Annex to this&#13;
Schedule.&#13;
&#13;
        Satisfactory operational principles were agreed and attached as an Annex to Schedule&#13;
        3 in the Loan Agreement. The Methodology for Selection and Evaluation of Cohorts&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       was reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. Amendments to the selection&#13;
       methodology for the third cohort competition were cleared by the Bank in July 2002.&#13;
       Each region is expected to receive two transfers from the RFRF in different years (in&#13;
       order to give it adequate time to implement reforms). RFRF continues to be a transfer&#13;
       window in the federal budget, transfers are allocated to the winning regions of&#13;
       different cohorts on a grant basis as a reward for successful implementation of their&#13;
       respective Regional Reform Programs.&#13;
&#13;
    0  The RFRF has, therefore, been created, in full compliance with the Loan Agreement,&#13;
       as an expenditure line item in the Federal Budget in 2002 and 2003 with annual&#13;
       amount of US$40 million in ruble equivalent each year. RFRF is operating according&#13;
       to the agreed procedures. Calculation of the total pool of potential resources for each&#13;
       cohort is the local currency equivalent of an average of US$8 million per selected&#13;
       region. RFRF resources for each cohort are allocated to selected regions on the basis&#13;
       of 30 percent of the pool divided equally, 30 percent proportional to regional&#13;
       population and 40 percent according to assessment of individual Regional Reform&#13;
       Programs.&#13;
&#13;
    0  Regional governments applied in three cohorts, seven oblasts or krays or republics in&#13;
       the first cohort, seven in the second cohort, and thirteen in the third cohort. Five&#13;
       regions of the first cohort and five regions of the second cohort were selected on a&#13;
       competitive basis and in compliance with agreed transparent procedures upon&#13;
       successful implementation of phase one of their respective regional fiscal reform&#13;
       programs (both phases were successfully implemented in the five regions of the first&#13;
       cohort). The selection of the five regions, the winners of grants in each cohort,&#13;
       occurred in November 2001 and October 2002. These programs were developed&#13;
       within a standard framework for all the regions. However, emphasis differed across&#13;
      regions, given the variations in the initial conditions among regions as determined by&#13;
      the diagnostic work.&#13;
&#13;
      The Ministry of Finance (MoF) evaluated the conformity of the regional fiscal reform&#13;
      programs from first two cohorts to the announced criteria, success in their&#13;
      implementation and compliance with required minimum standards (agreed with the&#13;
      Bank). Selection of five regions, the winners of grants in each cohort, occurred in&#13;
      November 2001 and October 2002 and was cleared by the Bank. Grants from RFRF&#13;
      were provided to five regions of the first cohort (Samarskaya oblast, St Petersburg&#13;
      City, Vologodskaya oblast, Chelyabinskaya oblast, Republic of Chuvashia) in&#13;
      October 2002 and to five regions of the second cohort (Republic of Karelia,&#13;
      Khabarovskiy kray, Krasnodarsluy kray, Astrakhanskaya oblast, Saratovskaya oblast)&#13;
      in December 2002.&#13;
&#13;
25. ConditionN2. The Law on the Federal Budget for the year 2003, as adopted by the&#13;
Borrower, contains a line item for the funding of the RFRF in the amount of US$40.0&#13;
million equivalent or a lesser amount as determined by criteria established for the&#13;
Program and as agreed between the Borrower and the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      RFRF is a line item in the Federal Budget 2003 with RUB 1300.4 million or US$40&#13;
      million equivalent budgeted for this year. Law on Federal Budget for 2003 has been&#13;
      approved by both chambers of parliament and signed by the President at the end of&#13;
      December 2002.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and reform programs to the MOF for evaluation.&#13;
26. Condition Ng3.Regions for second and third cohorts have presented applications&#13;
&#13;
