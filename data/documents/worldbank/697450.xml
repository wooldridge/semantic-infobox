JELGAVA DISTRICT HEATING REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
1. THE ECONOMY &amp; ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. Background and Recent Economic Development&#13;
1.1          Latvia regained its independence in September, 1991 following the collapse of the Former&#13;
Soviet Union (FSU). A country of 2.6 million people, Latvia covers an area of 25,000 square miles&#13;
(64,600 square kilometers) and is situated on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. It is bounded by Estonia&#13;
to the north, Lithuania to the south, Russia and Belarus to the east and has a 500-kilometer coastline on&#13;
the Baltic Sea.&#13;
1.2          Since independence, Latvia has taken major steps to reform its economy and has&#13;
succeeded in transforming its economy from a centrally planned to a market system. An IMF-supported&#13;
stabilization program launched by the Government of Latvia (GOL) in July, 1992 effectively uncoupled&#13;
the Latvian currency from the ruble zone. A permanent Latvian currency, the Lat (Ls), was introduced&#13;
in 1993. Successful implementation of the stabilization program enabled the country to pursue an&#13;
independent monetary policy and reap-the benefits of a prudent fiscal policy. As a result, inflation has&#13;
declined sharply from over 900 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1994. Structural adjustment in key areas&#13;
has progressed significantly: (i) most prices have been liberalized; (ii) an open trade regime has been&#13;
introduced and privatization of small businesses, agricultural land and banking institutions is well&#13;
advanced; and (iii) the Government is reforming the social safety net through better means-testing to focus&#13;
on social benefits specifically aimed at lower income groups. Banking and industrial sector reforms,&#13;
however, have been slower than initially anticipated. Latvia still faces a difficult reform agenda to&#13;
complete the transition to a sustainable and growing market-based economy. Latvia's aspiration to re-&#13;
integrate itself into Europe hinges on further development toward long-term political and exchange rate&#13;
stability, and deepening of structural reforms.&#13;
1.3          The World Bank's overall objective is to support Latvia's efforts to maintain stabilization&#13;
and accelerate growth which will depend to a large extent on the Government's commnitment and ability&#13;
to sustain and accelerate implementation of the reform program. This objective will be pursued through&#13;
a combination of lending operations, economic and sector work and aid coordination. The Bank is&#13;
supporting Latvia's energy infrastructure to overcome the backlog of deferred maintenance and to reorient&#13;
the energy sector to address energy conservation and enviromnent-related issues. Analytical work as well&#13;
as lending operations will support the Government in formulating and implementing a sound public&#13;
investment program and in coordinating assistance from other sources. The energy sector is a high&#13;
priority area in view of the dramatic price changes which have occurred over the past three years, the&#13;
country's dependence on energy imports and the resulting need for energy conservation and efficiency&#13;
improvements of energy facilities. The proposed project would support the objectives of promoting&#13;
energy conservation and efficiency improvements in the district heating (DH) subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                             The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
1.4          As part of the energy sector lending program and to further extend sector and policy&#13;
reform into different energy subsectors, the Government has requested World Bank financing for energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency measures in the district heating (DH) sector and for support in the&#13;
implementation of comprehensive energy sector restructuring, commercialization and privatization,&#13;
introduction of suitable regulatory framework, improvement in energy pricing policies and institutional&#13;
strengthening. The Bank's objective is to assist the Government through a combination of lending&#13;
operations, analytical sector work and coordination of technical assistance for institutional strengthening.&#13;
As part of the assistance strategy, the Bank assisted the Latvian Government with priority setting for&#13;
energy sector capital investment through the Public Expenditure Review (Report No. 12793-LV)1&#13;
exercise which included a technical assistance component for public investment planning funded through&#13;
donor grants. In addition to the current project, the Bank is actively engaged in providing technical&#13;
assistance for sector regulation and policy formulation in Latvia. An energy sector review aimed at&#13;
assisting the Latvian Government in formulating a comprehensive energy strategy consistent with new&#13;
political and economic realities is planned and is expected to be completed in 1997.&#13;
B. Overview of the Energy Sector&#13;
1.5          The energy sector plays a vital role in the Latvian economy through its impact on the&#13;
balance of payments and because energy is a major input to other sectors of the economy, especially&#13;
industry and agriculture. In 1992, Latvia spent the equivalent of 21 percent of its GDP for energy imports&#13;
and the equivalent figure for 1993 is 19 percent of GDP. Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea enables it&#13;
to play a significant role in East-West energy trade and to earn significant revenue from transit activities&#13;
of countries further inland that utilize Latvian ports for exports, especially energy products. Latvia's&#13;
relatively ice-free seaports of Ventspils, Liepaja and Riga are used as export terminals by countries&#13;
fiuther inland, principally Russia. In addition, Latvia has many geological formations that could be&#13;
dpveloped into gas storage facilities.&#13;
1.6          Energy Resources. Latvia's energy sector is heavily dependent on imports since the&#13;
country produces about 10 - 20 percent of its primary energy requirements. About half of all imported&#13;
fuel is used in the production of electricity and heat. As part of the Soviet Union, Latvia had access to&#13;
petroleum products and natural gas from Russia at below world market prices. 'Tis easy access to energy&#13;
resources led to systematic under-pricing of energy that, in turn, led to usage per unit of output&#13;
substantially higher than in market economies. Fortunately, however, it did not saddle Latvia with a lot&#13;
of energy-intensive heavy industry, the structure of Latvian industry being oriented to lighter and&#13;
technologically advanced industries that made use of an educated labor force. Out of date and often&#13;
inappropriate technologies resulted in large amounts of energy wastage. Price distortions and the absence&#13;
of private property rights created a bias against investments in energy efficiency, pollution abatement,&#13;
and adequate maintenance of plants.&#13;
1.7          Latvia imports natural gas from Russia, electricity from Estonia and petroleum products&#13;
from Russia and other FSU countries. Latvia's domestic primary energy resources, which comprise&#13;
hydropower, wood products, and peat, accounted for about 9 percent of its total energy needs in 1990&#13;
and about 19 percent in 1993. The Cascades Hydropower System on the Daugava River supplies about&#13;
1/Public Expenditure Review, July 12, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Economy &amp; Energy Sector                                                              3&#13;
35 percent of Latvia's annual electricity consumption. Latvia purchases most of its electricity from&#13;
neighboring Estonia, about 65 percent in 1992 and 41 percent in 1993. Since about 40 percent of&#13;
Latvia's landmass is covered by forest, it has a large reserve of wood and wood products. About 2.5&#13;
million m3 of wood is harvested annually, and initial estimates indicate that about 4.5 million m3 could&#13;
be harvested without adverse environmental effect. In addition, Latvia has an estimated peat reserve of&#13;
2,000 million tons, but the high extraction and transportation costs, low calorific content, combined with&#13;
a high potential for enviromnental degradation make peat less commercially competitive than other fuels.&#13;
1.8           Energy Consumption. The Latvian economy is very energy-intensive. A cross-country&#13;
analysis of energy consumption in relation to GDP using 1990 figures indicates that Latvia's rate of&#13;
energy use was 35 percent higher than twenty-one countries with similar climatic conditions. Given this&#13;
inefficiency in energy utilization, the rapid increases in fuel prices following the collapse of the FSU led&#13;
to very severe economic shocks and a substantial decline in energy demand. Demand for most energy&#13;
products in Latvia in 1993 was 50 - 65 percent of the 1990 level.&#13;
1.9           Energy consumption was estimated at 5.2 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 1993,&#13;
a 42 percent drop from the 1990 consumption of 9.0 Mtoe. The contraction of the Latvian economy is&#13;
reflected in energy consumption patterns. For example, the industrial sector's share of total energy&#13;
consumption was 26 percent in 1990 - a level comparable to Western Europe. By 1993, industry's share&#13;
of energy consumption declined to 20 percent.&#13;
1.10          Energy Facilities. Latvia's energy infrastructure has sufficient capacity to meet the&#13;
current level of demand, but suffers from low levels of maintenance and efficiency. Fiscal retrenchment&#13;
in Latvia, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, has meant a drastic decrease in public investment. The energy&#13;
sector's infrastructure networks have been among the hardest hit, either because the technology required&#13;
high maintenance, as in the DH sector, or because the facilities are worn down, as in gas storage. Even&#13;
routine maintenance has fallen to inadequate levels due to financial constraints and the difficulty of&#13;
procuring Soviet-made spare parts.2&#13;
1.11          Energy Sector Policy and Strategy.  The Latvian Government has taken steps to&#13;
restructure the sector to respond better to the needs of a market economy by decentralizing district heating&#13;
services, privatizing the oil sub-sector, commercializing the electricity and natural gas monopolies and&#13;
introducing targeted subsidies directed to consumers and not energy enterprises. However, the sector still&#13;
suffers from a number of institutional difficulties and a deep financial weakness. The inability of energy&#13;
consumers to make timely payment for services has led to accumulated arrears to sector enterprises and&#13;
created a rather complicated inter-enterprise debt situation. As at the beginning of April 1994, the&#13;
combined accounts receivable for the electricity and natural gas monopolies, Latvenergo and Latvijas&#13;
Gaze, was estimated at Lats 128 million3 (US$233 million equivalent) down from a peak of about Lats&#13;
2/ Further information on the energy sector can be found in the World Bank publication entitled&#13;
'Latvia - The Transition to a Market Economy", (Report Number ISBN 0-8213-2324-5), published&#13;
in March 1993.&#13;
3/These estimates are provided to emphasize the order of magnitude of the debts of the energy&#13;
sector. Their accuracy is difficult to ascertain due to double counting of both accounts payable and&#13;
accounts receivable as debt, failure to offset corresponding payables and receivables of mutually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                              The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
145 million (US$264 million equivalent) in the third quarter of 1993. Also, sectoral restructuring and&#13;
the ensuing shift in responsibilities between the various institutions in the sector has led to a lack of&#13;
clarity in institutional boundaries. The delay in the emergence of a strong institution to take sector&#13;
leadership has often given a perception of an institutional leadership vacuum in the sector.&#13;
1.12         The energy sector has been identified as one of the priority sectors to be rehabilitated&#13;
during the transition period. The Government is in the process of formulating an energy policy which&#13;
would be based on the strategic objective of providing long-term reliable energy services at the lowest&#13;
economic cost with due regard to environrmental concerns and security of supply. Based on the&#13;
preliminary proposals presented to the donor meeting in Paris in May 1994, the specific objectives of the&#13;
policy are: (i) optimal economic utilization of energy resources; (ii) increased use of renewable indigenous&#13;
energy resources; (iii) efficient performance and maintenance of existing facilities; and (iv) diversification&#13;
of fuel choice and supply.&#13;
1.13         In line with these objectives, the Government has undertaken a number of projects and&#13;
studies, supported by several multilateral and bilateral agencies (EU-PHARE, EBRD, BITS, USAID, etc)&#13;
to: (i) improve efficiency and reliability of existing energy systems through improved operations and&#13;
rehabilitation of existing facilities; (ii) improve the diversity of fuel choice through the development of&#13;
indigenous energy resources - mainly hydropower, wood products, and peat - in order to reduce the high&#13;
cost of fuel import, and (iii) introduce public awareness campaigns to inform and educate citizens on the&#13;
sectoral issues.&#13;
1.14         Given Latvia's dependency on energy imports, security of supply is a major concern of&#13;
the Government. The power sector is especially concerned about the need to increase domestic electricity&#13;
production to ensure that electric power is not a constraint to future economic growth. There is little&#13;
economic justification for building new power plants, given current low electricity import prices and the&#13;
considerable excess power generating capacity in neighboring Estonia and Lithuania. Dependence on&#13;
Russia for natural gas imports is also a major concern, thus the Government's emphasis on fuel&#13;
diversification. However, the Government has adopted the prudent policy of investing in energy&#13;
efficiency and conservation rather than new power generation facilities in the short term when electricity&#13;
imports are relatively cheap.&#13;
1.15         Within the sector strategy, a high priority is accorded to investments in the district heating&#13;
sub-sector which is a major energy user, but provides a basic human need given Latvia's climatic&#13;
conditions. It is estimated that 30 percent of Latvia's energy resources are used for the provision of space&#13;
heating and hot water for households and public buildings. The size of the district heating sub-sector in&#13;
overall fuel use and the proportion of the population subject to district heating systems establish it as a&#13;
priority for rehabilitation.&#13;
1.16         Energy Sector Institutions &amp; Management. The institutional structure of the energy sector&#13;
has undergone major transformation since Latvian Independence and is still evolving. Immediately&#13;
following independence, the overall responsibility for the sector (i.e. policy formulation and&#13;
implementation, regulation, enterprise ownership and management) rested with the Ministry of Industry&#13;
and Energy. Following the reorganization of the Government in July 1993, the Ministry of Industry and&#13;
indebted enterprises, the tendency of enterprises to exaggerate debt positions, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Economy &amp; Energy Sector                                                              5&#13;
Energy was abolished and responsibility for the energy sector was transferred to the Energy Division&#13;
within the newly created Ministry of Economy. At the present time, responsibility for policy formulation&#13;
and facilitation of energy sector development and investments rests with the Energy Division of the&#13;
Ministry of Economy. In line with the recommendations of the EU-PHARE financed "Latvia Energy&#13;
Sector Restructuring Study" completed in August, 1993, responsibility for enterprise management and&#13;
policy implementation were divested from the ministry and given to the newly created joint-stock&#13;
companies: Latvenergo, Latvijas Gaze. The joint-stock companies were given independent legal status&#13;
and a two-tier management structure comprising a board of directors with external representation and a&#13;
management board of key enterprise managers introduced. The Latvian Energy Agency (LEA) was&#13;
established in January 1994 to assist the Energy Division in policy implementation but has been largely&#13;
ineffective due to limited budgetary resources. In line with the Government's policy of transferring&#13;
responsibility for local functions to the municipalities, ownership of district heating systems has been&#13;
transferred to the municipalities.&#13;
1'. 17       Energy sector legislation is currently under preparation. The legislation would define a&#13;
regulatory framework focused on the: (i) definition of the rights and obligations of a regulatory authority&#13;
and sector enterprises; (ii) introduction of an authorization process for effective control of enterprises;&#13;
and (iii) definition of appropriate technical codes and standards. Under the law, an Energy Regulation&#13;
Board is expected to be instituted which would have the responsibility for regulating the energy sector.&#13;

purchases, transmits, distributes and sells 99.9 percent of the electricity consumed in Latvia. Latvenergo,&#13;
through its subsidiary Termofikacijas Parvalde, also produces, transmits and sells heat to three towns -&#13;
Riga, Olaine and Liepaja.&#13;
1.19         Latvijas Gaze, the gas monopoly, handles all operations related to the supply and&#13;
distribution of natural gas and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in Latvia. Gas distribution within Latvia is&#13;
handled through four regional distribution companies which are wholly owned by Latvijas Gaze. Latvijas&#13;
Gaze, which purchases gas mainly from Russia, also operates the Inculkans underground gas storage&#13;
facility.&#13;
1.20         Latvijas Nafta and Latvijas Kurinamas are involved in the supply of oil products and solid&#13;
fuels respectively. Latvijas Nafta, the former oil supply monopoly which accounted for less than 10&#13;
percent of oil sales in 1993, is in the process of being privatized. Though most of Latvijas Nafta's assets&#13;
have been divested to private companies, the company still operates a number of oil product storage&#13;
facilities in Latvia. Latvijas Kurinamas has the responsibility for the supply of solid fuels, especially&#13;
coal.&#13;
1.21         The Association of Heat Producers, an interest group created following the&#13;
recommendation of the EU-PHARE study, is similar to the District Heating Associations found in&#13;
Scandinavian countries that have large district heating systems.&#13;
1.22         Energy Prices. The Latvian Government adopted the principle of full cost recovery in&#13;
energy pricing in October 1993. Prior to the decision, the Government had attempted to control energy&#13;
prices in all sectors through a rather complex system of direct and indirect subsidies that unduly penalized&#13;
industrial consumers and placed a huge burden on the national budget. After the 1992-93 heating season,&#13;
it became obvious that the Government could not afford the huge burden that energy subsidies placed on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                              The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
the budget, especially in view of the IMFf-supported stabilization program that had begun in July 1992.&#13;
Following the Government decision to liberalize energy prices in October 1993, the authority for district&#13;
heating tariff approval was decentralized to the respective municipal councils though approval of natural&#13;
gas and electricity tariffs was retained by the Cabinet of Ministers. Given the liberalization of the oil&#13;
sector and the entrance of private players, it became obvious that the Government could not control prices&#13;
for oil products. Thus, pricing of petroleum products is market determined and is not subject to approvals&#13;
or control by the Government.&#13;
1.23         Between 1990 and 1994, domestic energy prices have increased by an average of 400&#13;
times in real terms. Most notable are the prices of natural gas and heavy fuel oil imports, which increased&#13;
more than 500 and 300-fold, respectively, during this period. Overall, the import price of natural gas&#13;
and oil products are currently at world market levels. Since liberalization, heavy fuel oil import prices&#13;
have fallen by half from a peak of Lats 97.5/ton in 1992 to Lats 45/ton in 1994. Surplus generation&#13;
capacity in neighboring Estonia and Lithuania has enabled Latvia to pay an electricity import price of&#13;
US$0.015/KWh, which is considerably below equivalent world prices.&#13;
1.24         Domestic tariffs for electricity and natural gas are currently at levels sufficient to ensure&#13;
recovery cf operating costs. The Government policy is to move to full cost recovery, including&#13;
appropriate provisions for investments, depreciation, and recovery of arrears. According to Latvenergo&#13;
figures, the 1993 average tariff of Lats 0.020/KWh (US$0.036/KWh) was just sufficient to cover&#13;
recurrent expenditures. For 1993, Latvenergo estimates its average electricity production cost, including&#13;
imports, at US$0.013/KWh. It also estimates the variable cost for domestic electricity production from&#13;
its thermal plants at US$0.032/KWh and from the hydropower plants at US$0.0091KWh for 1993. In&#13;
1993, electricity tariffs for the different consumer categories ranged from US$0.0151KWh for mass&#13;
transportation consumers to US$0.044/KWh for industrial consumers. Residential consumers paid&#13;
US$0.027/KWh. While industrial consumers continue to subsidize residential consumers, the number&#13;
of consumer classifications for tariff purposes is now three compared to thirteen in 1991.&#13;
1.25         The structure of domestic natural gas tariffs is similar to that of electricity with large&#13;
industrial consumers subsidizing residential consumers. In 1993, the average natural gas price was&#13;
US$116 per thousand cubic meters and has fallen to US$l I1 per thousand cubic meters for the 1994/95&#13;
heating season. However, many industrial consumers have switched from gas to cheaper alternative fuels&#13;
thereby leading the Latvian Government to consider lowering gas prices for industrial consumers.&#13;
Adopting a pricing mechanism based on alternative fuels would effectively reduce cross-subsidization of&#13;
residential consumers by industrial consumers.&#13;

1.26         Energy Conservation. The Latvian Government has sought and received assistance from&#13;
various multilateral and bilateral agencies in the area of energy conservation. In 1993, under USAID&#13;
assistance, a team of expatriate and local experts undertook energy audits of various industrial enterprises&#13;
to identify low-cost energy savings measures. Investments for implementing the identified measures, up&#13;
to maximum of US$50,000, for both industrial processes and the premises were also provided. Under&#13;
the EU-PHARE assistance strategy for Latvia, energy conservation has received and continues to receive&#13;
prominent attention. The Energy Savings Strategy Study completed in July 1993 identified a number of&#13;
pilot projects for investments and proposed a draft law on energy conservation for Latvia. An energy&#13;
awareness campaign which began during the summer of 1994 is aimed at acquainting all energy users,&#13;
both industrial and the general public, with energy saving measures and techniques and at raising the&#13;
general awareness level on energy issues. A mass media campaign utilizing both the broadcast and print&#13;
media has made some progress in disseminating infornation about the energy sector in general and also&#13;
providing information on simple cost-effective energy conservation measures which each household can&#13;
implement to reduce its energy bill. The Awareness Campaign Program also includes seminars and&#13;
symposia for top managers in industry with the major objective of gaining their commitment to facilitate&#13;
adoption of energy saving measures at their enterprises. Other EU funded programns, as well as a number&#13;
of other multilateral and bilateral donors are active in providing assistance to the Latvian Government on&#13;
energy conservation issues.&#13;

8                                                             The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
f                            C. District Heating Sub-sector&#13;
1.27         Latvia has an extensive district heating system dating from the early 1950s. Heat&#13;
production facilities supply industries with hot water and steam and households with heating and hot&#13;
water. Overall, about 60 percent of all Latvian households use district heating, primarily in urban areas.&#13;
About 80 percent of all households in Riga are connected to the DH system compared to about 4 percent&#13;
in rural areas. The DH systems are owned and operated primarily by the municipalities though&#13;
Latvenergo, the electricity monopoly, owns parts of the system in Riga, Olaine and Liepaja.&#13;
1.28         The DH systems in Latvia, as in most of the FSU, are recognized as inefficient converters&#13;
of fuel to heat and hot water. The inefficiency stems from several factors: (i) reliance upon heat-only&#13;
boilers (HOB) for heat production as opposed to the more cost effective combined heat and power (CHP)&#13;
boilers; (ii) use of boilers with very low conversion efficiency compared to boilers in use in western&#13;
countries; (iii) transmission and distribution network technology with very short life expectancy and large&#13;
annual maintenance and replacement expenditures, without which heat and water losses would be&#13;
extremely high; and (iv) lack of metering and control devices which prevent optimization of heat supply&#13;
and demand. While low energy prices in the past masked the degree of inefficiency in the system, the&#13;
rapid growth in energy prices over the past few years has increased the incentives for developing a more&#13;
technically efficient DH system in Latvia. Given the high cost of gas and heavy fuel oil, the two major&#13;
fuels used in heat production, both the central and municipal governments in Latvia recognize that&#13;
improvements in the operational efficiency of the DH system are essential to ensure efficient delivery of&#13;
heating services in a cost effective manner. However, it is essential that district heating be assessed as&#13;
one of a number of options for providing heat to consumers.&#13;
1.29         The institutional setup for the DH subsector in Latvia is new and rather fragile. Many&#13;
of the DH enterprises in Latvia have only been in existence since 1992 and were established under the&#13;
Latvian Government's program of decentralizing responsibility for local matters to municipal&#13;
governments. Many of these enterprises are very weak both organizationally and financially. While&#13;
privatization of the DH subsector is currently unfeasible given the weak financial position of the DH&#13;
enterprises, it is imperative to ensure that managerial and organizational efficiency is developed along&#13;
with technical efficiency.&#13;
1.30         District Heating Facilities. Heat is produced either in combined-heat-and-power (CHP)&#13;
or in heat-only-boiler (HOB) plants. Though economically more efficient, the use of CHP is limited to&#13;
two large plants in Riga (Riga TEC-1 and Riga TEC-2) and four plants outside Riga which are all owned&#13;
by large factories. These CHP plants have an imputed efficiency of about 74 percent but their operational&#13;
efficiency is estimated to be lower. The total length of the DH network in Latvia is about 3,500&#13;
kilometers of pipeline, of which the length of transmission lines is 350 kilometers. The average length&#13;
of pipeline over which heat is transported between the heat source and the end-user is about 6 kilometers&#13;
in Riga and 4 kilometers in each of the DH systems in the rest of the country.&#13;
1.31         About 85 percent of the heat networks in Latvia transmit and distribute heat through pipes&#13;
encased in concrete ducts. The pipes are poorly insulated with mineral wool and bitumen board. In a&#13;
number of channels, insulation is made of bitumen perlite, which, when exposed to water through&#13;
leakage, acts as a corrosive agent; this leads to excessive corrosion and premature degradation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Economy &amp; Energy Sector                                                             9&#13;
pipes requiring replacement in about 2 - 5 years, considerably below the design life of 10 - 15 years.&#13;
The remaining 15 percent of pipes, which are mounted above ground, are generally poorly insulated with&#13;
mineral wool and covered with metal sheets, and distribution branches and valves are mostly not&#13;
insulated. As water losses are high (often as high as 34 percent of flow as compared with less than 0.5&#13;
percent in well-designed and operated DH systems), the water treatment systems bave difficulty coping&#13;
with the high volume of make-up water4. The high leakage rate does not allow for proper water&#13;
treatment leading to internal corrosion in the pipes and other equipment. Also, the current shortage of&#13;
chemicals has further aggravated the water treatment situation. Improvements in insulation, water&#13;
treatment and abatement of leakages are needed to reduce energy and water losses in the systems. In&#13;
addition to greater efficiency, this will also lead to environmental improvements in the affected areas.&#13;
1.32         District Heating System Operation. The DH system in Latvia is designed to operate at&#13;
an outgoing water temperature of 150 - 950C and returning water temperature of about 70Â°C. Given the&#13;
rapid growth in fuel prices during 1992 and 1993, most district heating enterprises were unable to pay&#13;
for fuels and consequently were forced to run the DH systems at sub-optimal temperatures; outgoing&#13;
water temperature of 60 - 40Â°C which is inadequate to provide satisfactory service. Temperatures in&#13;
homes during the past few heating seasons have averaged around 10-150C and hot water supplies have&#13;
been rationed. Consumer connections in substations do not have any controls and operate with constant&#13;
flow and pressure conditions, requiring the DH system to operate on the same flow rate throughout the&#13;
beating season. This mode of operation does not allow the flow to vary according to energy demand.&#13;
The present systems also do not have the capability of economic dispatch to allow the operator to use the&#13;
least expensive source of heat at any given time. Maintenance in all parts of the DH system is poor due&#13;
primarily to the limited availability of funds for repairs and spare parts.&#13;
1.33         District Heating Fuels. In 1991, natural gas was the main fuel used in the production of&#13;
heat and accounted for about 52 percent of all fuel consumed in DH; heavy fuel oil accounted for about&#13;
32 percent. Following the rapid increases in energy prices, the proportion of boilers utilizing heavy fuel&#13;
oil, which is currently less expensive than natural gas, has increased and now accounts for about 45&#13;
percent with natural gas accounting for about 25 percent. About 60-90 percent of the cost of production&#13;
of heat in oil or gas-fired boilers is attributable to the fuel cost alone. In 1992, heat production was&#13;
estimated at about 38 TWh. Therefore, investments which would increase the efficiency of these boilers&#13;
or convert boilers from use of high-cost imported fuels to lower-cost imported or domestic fuels, where&#13;
technically possible, are of the highest priority in reducing the cost of heat production.&#13;
1.34         Heat Tariffs. The Government's policy, adopted on October 13, 1993, is aimed at cost&#13;
recovery in the DH subsector and requires municipal governments to make up the difference between the&#13;
approved tariff and actual cost of heat supply, if approved tariffs are set below cost recovery. In&#13;
practice, district heating tariffs are currendy at levels insufficient to meet full production costs in many&#13;
locations and constraints on municipal budgets make payments of the shortfall to district heating&#13;
enterprises extremely difficult.&#13;
1.35         The growth in heat tariffs has been astronomical since the onset of the energy crisis in&#13;
1991 but has not been matched by corresponding growth in household incomes. Between 1991 and 1993,&#13;
A/ Make-up water is the additional water that is pumped into the district heating network to&#13;
compensate for water lost due to leakage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                                                               The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
nominal wages grew by 93 percent while real wages declined about 30 percent. During the. 1992/93&#13;
heating season, heat tariffs were adjusted monthly to keep pace with the escalating fuel costs and inflation&#13;
and it was not uncommon for heat bills to represent 60-90 percent of total monthly household income and&#13;
in some cases even exceed it especially for pensioners and other low-income households. However, real&#13;
wage growth was 1 percent in 1993 and is estimated at 12 percent5 for 1994. This positive trend in real&#13;
wage growth is expected to continue, thus making energy more affordable in the future.&#13;
1.36          Based on unverifiable data obtained for the 1993/94 heating season, it would appear that&#13;
the average district heat tariff for all municipalities in Latvia, excluding Riga, was at 90 percent of actual&#13;
production costs. District heat tariffs ranged from US$9.09/GCal to US$25.29/GCal at different locations&#13;
within the country, and actual production costs varied between US$9.91/GCal and US$34.09/GCal as&#13;
district heating costs and tariffs vary greatly across cities within Latvia based on system specifics.6&#13;
1.37          On the positive side, most municipalities have taken significant steps to reduce cross-&#13;
subsidization by consumer category. Starting with a rather cumbersome tariff structure with several&#13;
consumer categories in 1991, the current tariff structure adopted by most municipalities has only three&#13;
consumer classifications consisting of households, budgetary institutions (e.g. schools, hospitals) and&#13;
industrial enterprises. However, a number of issues remain to be resolved in district heating pricing.&#13;
First, the true level of costs in the subsector is difficult to ascertain due to lack of reliable data. Financial&#13;
projections for tariff approval are often fraught with errors and a major point of contention between&#13;
municipal authorities and heat producers. Second, tariff approval procedures and other regulatory issues&#13;
for the district heating subsector are unclear as many municipalities do not have the capability to truly&#13;
regulate the enterprises. Third, the inefficiency of the district heating systems, resulting from lower&#13;
design standards than used in western systems, the dilapidated state of facilities, and inefficient&#13;
operations, lead to higher tariffs than for more efficient systems. Fourth, political considerations and&#13;
ability of consumers to pay high tariffs often lead to approval of tariffs at levels insufficient to cover&#13;
costs.&#13;
1.38          The current project will provide technical assistance7 and consultant services: (i) to&#13;
improve the financial and accounting systems of JDHC, and (ii) to assist the municipality in exercising&#13;
its regulatory functions over the district heating enterprise. The results from the Jelgava project will&#13;
assist other newly created municipal district heating enterprises which lack basic accounting and econornic&#13;
skills in designing appropriate solutions to similar problems. Technical assistance for institutional&#13;
restructuring of JDHC is currently underway, and a tariff formulation study was completed in January&#13;
1995. The planned investments would help reduce system inefficiencies, thus decreasing the level of&#13;
tariffs needed for full cost recovery. With respect to political concerns about consumers' ability to pay,&#13;
I/ Wage growth estimate is based on salaries in the state sector, comprising budgetary organizations&#13;
and state enterprises.&#13;
Â§/ System specifics include fuel choice, technical condition of the system, and heat source mix -&#13;
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) or Heat Only Boilers (HOB) plants.&#13;
I/ At the request of the Latvian Govermnent, a separate district heating pricing study will be&#13;
undertaken in 1995, with supervision assistance from the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Economy &amp; Energy Sector                                                             11&#13;
the introduction of the low-income household assistance program will reduce the burden of tariff increases&#13;
on the poorest groups.&#13;
1.39         Heat Subsidies and Social Safety Net.  During the 1992/93 heating season, the&#13;
Government introduced an energy survival program for the country. The three main points of the&#13;
program were: (i) introduction of market prices for all fuels and other imported energy inputs; (ii)&#13;
approval of heat and electricity tariffs at less than full production costs; (iii) provision of state subsidies&#13;
to heat and power utilities to cover the difference between tariffs and production costs. The level of&#13;
subsidies was inadequate to cover all costs of production and the delay in payment of subsidies to utilities&#13;
combined with high inflation further exacerbated the situation. In addition, the inability of many&#13;
consumers to pay their heat bills in a timely fashion led to rapid growth in account receivables of all heat&#13;
producers. Direct subsidies to heat producers were eliminated for the 1993/94 heating season.&#13;
1.40         In recognition of the non-affordability of energy resources to sections of the population&#13;
and in line with its decision to discontinue direct subsidies to energy utilities, the Government created a&#13;
program for social assistance to low-income households to meet housing rent and utility bills. The decree&#13;
establishing the program is included as Annex 1. The program is jointly funded from both central and&#13;
municipal budgets on a 51 percent/49 percent basis though the funding mix differs between municipalities.&#13;
In general, the larger urban municipalities with good revenue bases contribute a higher percentage to the&#13;
program. Prior to October 1993, funds from the central budget were released to match municipal&#13;
contributions to the program. As a consequence, the program was grossly under-funded during the&#13;
1993/94 heating season as most municipalities were unable to release funds for the program and thus did&#13;
not receive promised central funds. The Government has taken a number of steps to make the program&#13;
more efficient, These include the release of central funds regularly without waiting for matching&#13;
municipal contributions, greater public awareness through mass media campaigns, and better means-&#13;
testing mechanisms.&#13;
D. Bank Energy Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.41         As part of the energy sector lending program and to further extend sector and policy&#13;
reform into different energy subsectors, the Government has requested World Bank financing for energy&#13;
conservation and efficiency measures in the district heating (DH) sector and for support in the&#13;
implementation of comprehensive energy sector restructuring, commercialization and privatization,&#13;
introduction of a suitable regulatory framework, improvement in energy pricing policies and institutional&#13;
strengthening. The investments to be supported by the Bank would be expected to lower energy import&#13;
requirements and production and operating costs and thus make energy services more affordable and&#13;
reduce the need for Government subsidies. The selected investments would focus on increasing&#13;
operational efficiency and plant rehabilitation, rather than construction of new facilities where existing&#13;
capacity is sufficient, conversion of plant to use domestic fuels, and environmental improvements. High&#13;
priority would be given to investments in the DH and power sectors and the associated institutional and&#13;
financial strengthening of the responsible agencies. For large energy investments, a regional approach&#13;
would be required to prevent duplication of capacity and resource misallocation. Energy investments&#13;
would also address environmental problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                            The Economy &amp; Energy Sector&#13;
1.42         The proposed Loan represents the first Bank investment loan in the energy sector to&#13;
Latvia. The project has been designed as a demonstration project to test solutions for energy savings and&#13;
reduced energy imports (see para. 3.4). A Bank Rehabilitation Loan (LV-3525) of US$ 45 million was&#13;
approved in October 1992 and provided financing for imported goods in priority sectors during a&#13;
transition period of about 18 months in support of Latvia's economic reform program. About US$ 22.8&#13;
million under this Loan was allocated for imports of fuel oil and natural gas. A co-financing arrangement&#13;
for the Rehabilitation loan provided an additional US$35 million from the Japanese Export-Import Bank.&#13;
Of this amount, US$23 million was allocated for natural gas imports. Implementation of the Loan is&#13;
proceeding satisfactorily, and energy imports were procured quickly to improve the availability of energy&#13;
supplies during the past two winters.&#13;
1.43         Past experience in implementation of other Bank-supported DH projects is limited to an&#13;
ongoing project in Poland, a component of an environmental project in China, a project in Estonia&#13;
approved in May 1994, and a second project in Poland approved in November 1994; the latter two have&#13;
recently become effective. Some lessons learned to-date include: (a) decentralized project management&#13;
arrangements work far better than centralized arrangements; and (b) it is important to ensure that future&#13;
investments in expanding the DH systems are properly justified and therefore heat planning for the long-&#13;
term development of major DH systems should be undertaken during the project period. These lessons&#13;
have been considered in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
1.44         The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's overall country assistance strategy in&#13;
Latvia, which assigns emphasis to the energy sector and seeks to support Latvia's efforts to improve&#13;
energy efficiency by replacing or rehabilitating existing production facilities. The strategy also calls for&#13;
greater efforts in energy conservation, pricing and transfer of ownership. The project is also fully&#13;
consistent with the Government's energy policy, which supports energy conservation, improvement of&#13;
the efficiency of energy facilities, reduction of environmental impact, and rehabilitation of existing plants.&#13;
The efficiency gains and reduced import bill would lead to lower costs of heat production and operation&#13;
thereby resulting in more affordable heat tariffs and lower requirements for heat subsidies. Most&#13;
importantly, the quality and reliability of heating services would be improved. At the same time,&#13;
institutional development programs for concerned energy agencies would help strengthen their&#13;
management and operations.&#13;
&#13;

The Project                                                                            13&#13;
II. THE CITY OF JELGAVA AND JDHC&#13;
2.1          The City of Jelgava has a population of approximately 75,000, and is located about 30&#13;
km south of Riga, on the Lielupe River. The surrounding areas are mainly flat land, only some meters&#13;
above sea level, with a mixture of forests and farm land. The soil in the area is often water-logged and&#13;
the ground water level is extremely high.&#13;
2.2          Prior to independence, Jelgava was one of the major industrial cities in Latvia. The four&#13;
largest industrial enterprises being the Riga Autobus Factory (RAF), Sugar Factory, Agricultural&#13;
Machinery Factory, and the Linen Flax Factory. The Agricultural University is also a major employer&#13;
in the City. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting disruption in trade, these four&#13;
industrial concerns suffered severe output decline. The collapse of these industries adversely affected the&#13;
City and its inhabitants. Beginning in 1992, the City of Jelgava began to restructure its economy through&#13;
a program to encourage entrepreneurial activities. With assistance from various bilateral sources, the City&#13;
set up a business center and succeeded in registering 1,300 small businesses by the end of 1994. This&#13;
grassroots economic renewal and the proximity to Riga have enabled Jelgava recover more rapidly from&#13;
economic recession. While the restructuring of the four main industrial concerns is yet to begin, the most&#13;
likely outcome is expected to be privatization with equity participation from foreign firms with western&#13;
technical know-how.&#13;
2.3          The Jelgava District Heating Company (JDHC) is a municipal enterprise in accordance&#13;
with the Latvian Law on Municipal Enterprises. Under the law, municipal enterprises have a high degree&#13;
of autonomy in enterprise management and operations and the municipality retains the right to appoint&#13;
the managing director of the enterprise and to approve tariffs. In practice, district heating enterprises&#13;
enjoy less autonomy than provided by the law due to their weak financial positions which engender a high&#13;
degree of dependence on municipal funds for their daily operations. Under the current setup, the&#13;
Managing Director is appointed for a five-year term and has total responsibility for all administrative and&#13;
personnel matters, and undertakes investment decisions in conjunction with the City Technical Department&#13;
and the City Chief Economist. JDHC currently employs 278 people. The present organization of JDHC&#13;
is shown in Annex 3 of the SAR. As part of the commercialization of JDHC, agreement was obtained&#13;
during negotiations that by March 31, 1996; the City of Jelgava would register JDHC as a joint stock&#13;
company (para 6.1 (i)).&#13;
2.4          Since JDHC's establishment in 1992 as a municipal enterprise, the City of Jelgava has&#13;
been very supportive of JDHC both in terms of approving tariff increases and providing financial&#13;
assistance both for operational and investment needs. The City provided over Lats 200,000 to JDHC in&#13;
interest free short term loans in 1992, and Lats 220,000 borrowed from the Swedish Government through&#13;
the NUTEK program to undertake urgent rehabilitation of the DH system. Another major area of&#13;
cooperation for both the City and JDHC has been in energy conservation. The City of Jelgava has&#13;
initiated a program on public education and awareness in energy conservation and sees the metering of&#13;
residential consumers as essential in influencing consumer behavior. The City has benefited greatly from&#13;
being included as a pilot site under the EU-PHARE financed "Energy Savings Strategy Study'. One of&#13;
its major industrial concerns, the Sugar Factory, was also a pilot site and beneficiary under the USAID&#13;
financed energy audit program. Using the results of the extensive work done on energy efficiency&#13;
improvements during preparation of the current project, the City of Jelgava is seeking financial assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                                          The Project&#13;
from a number of sources, including the Danish concessional loan facility for Latvia, to undertake&#13;
housing improvements in order to improve insulation and reduce specific energy consumption. The City&#13;
of Jelgava had initially hoped to utilize funds provided by the EBRD for building improvements but had&#13;
to abandon the idea due to the difficulty of ensuring cost recovery and the delay in sorting out property&#13;
ownership issues in Latvia. It did, however, borrow from the EBRD to purchase heat meters (see para&#13;
3.3).&#13;

The Project                                                                         15&#13;
m. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1          The project, which would be the first energy sector investment project in Latvia, would&#13;
have the following main objectives:&#13;
(a)   to extend the life, and increase the operating efficiency, of the Jelgava District&#13;
Heating System through rehabilitation and introduction of modem technologies&#13;
and materials;&#13;
(b)   to improve environmental conditions in affected areas by improving the efficiency&#13;
of fuel use, facilitating the elimination of low-stack coal-fired boilers in&#13;
residential areas, reducing wastage of water in DH systems;&#13;
(c)   to support the strengthening and restructuring of the Jelgava District Heating&#13;
Company (JDHC) through consultancy and advisory services, training and&#13;
provision of equipment and software; and&#13;
(d)   to act as a pilot project for DH system rehabilitation, from soviet-type constant&#13;
flow system to western European technology, for other locations within Latvia.&#13;
B. Project Rationale&#13;
3.2         In its energy strategy planning, the Latvian Government has attempted to develop pilot&#13;
projects in order to better understand new technologies before embarking on large scale investments.&#13;
Following this strategy, a number of municipalities were approached as possible sites to be included in&#13;
a DH rehabilitation program under the EU-PHARE financed "Energy Sector Savings Strategy" study. The&#13;
City of Jelgava was one of the sites selected under the study and proposed by the Government to the&#13;
World Bank energy identification mission that visited Latvia in December 1992. The clear institutional&#13;
and ownership structure for the provision of DH services in Jelgava made it a good candidate for a pilot&#13;
project. A pilot project requires, for speed of implementation, that there are no fundamental problems&#13;
of decision-taking and ownership, and Jelgava has been able to satisfy these requirements. Added to this,&#13;
both the municipal government and the DH company have shown themselves willing to cooperate with&#13;
both the Bank and the Government and to pursue an improvement strategy that meets sectoral&#13;
development objectives.&#13;
3.3          In addition, the City of Jelgava had already began a rehabilitation project with funds from&#13;
the Swedish Government under the NUTEK program and EBRD Energy Emergency Loan. Under the&#13;
NUTEK program, about 600 meters of the transmission pipeline from the main boiler plant was&#13;
rehabilitated and some measurement and control equipment installed. This pilot project enabled JDHC&#13;
to test out the introduction of new technology, especially the handling and installation of pre-insulated&#13;
pipes instead of the existing system of steel pipes in concrete channels. The funds from the EBRD loan&#13;
were used to procure heat meters for buildings owned by the City of Jelgava. Implementation of both&#13;
the NUTEK program and the EBRD loan were successfully completed in the summer of 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16                                                                             The Project&#13;
3.4           The Jelgava project will demonstrate possible solutions to a variety of problems that are&#13;
endemic to DH systems in Latvia. These include the need to: (i) rationalize heat generation; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitate existing DH networks; (iii) introduce modern technology in DH systems; (iv) ameliorate water&#13;
loss; (v) improve DH water treatment systems; (vi) introduce production and end-user metering; (vii)&#13;
improve the maintenance function; (viii) modernize enterprise commercial systems; and (ix) improve&#13;
enterprise internal organization. In addition, the project should demonstrate that it can be replicated in&#13;
municipalities whose district heating systems are relatively similar both in size and environmental&#13;
conditions. Finally, the project will be a good testing ground for other aspects such as the exercise of&#13;
the municipalities' regulatory functions over the district heating enterprise; financial discipline in bill&#13;
collection and effective imposition of hard budget constraint for energy; and the targeting of subsidies&#13;
to the lowest income groups.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.5           The proposed project consists of two components:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitation of Jelgava District Heating (DH) system, through a program to&#13;
upgrade the system to a variable flow regime; increase boiler efficiency; abate&#13;
leakage; install heat meters; eliminate environmentally unsound, low-stack coal-&#13;
fired boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function; and&#13;
(b)   institutional support for policy reform, project implementation and enterprise&#13;
restructuring for project agencies.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Jeigava District Heating (DH) System&#13;
3.6           The Jelgava District Heating Company (DHC) operates a heating system consisting of&#13;
approximately 47 km of two-pipe network and 25 km of four-pipe network. The Jelgava DH system is&#13;
divided into two major parts, East and West by the Lielupe River. The DH system on the West consists&#13;
of a major interconnected network which is supplied with heat from JDHC's own boilers. In addition,&#13;
there are six small, isolated island networks which are supplied by small individual boilers. The DH&#13;
system on the East side consists of a network supplying mainly a few large industrial concerns and only&#13;
a small number of residential consumers.&#13;
3.7           The component consists of:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitating the most corroded sections of the two-pipe transmission network&#13;
by replacing the corroded network sections (11.3 km) with plastic-jacketed, pre-&#13;
insulated pipe to seal leaks and reduce internal corrosion.&#13;
(b)   rehabilitating the worst sections (10.5 km) of the four-pipe secondary network&#13;
by converting them to two-pipe systems. The corroded domestic hot water&#13;
carrier pipes would be replaced with domestic hot water heat exchangers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              17&#13;
equipped with automatic temperature controls in individual buildings, and the&#13;
main radiator risers in the buildings would be equipped with automatic&#13;
temperature control sets, consisting of mixing pumps, controllers and balancing&#13;
valves. The main heat sources of the West side network would be equipped with&#13;
variable speed pumps and differential pressure control valves at strategic points&#13;
of the network. These improvements would extend the life expectancy of these&#13;
secondary systems from the current 3-5 years to 30 years. Moreover, the use of&#13;
automatic temperature control for domestic hot water and radiator circulation&#13;
water could reduce heat losses due to overheating by 20 percent;&#13;
(c)    installing new variable speed pumps at the Ganibu and Rupniecibas boilerhouses&#13;
to facilitate the system conversion from constant to variable flow;&#13;
(d)    improving the quality of water in the DH system through the repair of existing&#13;
water treatment facilities and the addition of pre-coated bypass filters;&#13;
(e)    integrating small isolated island networks into the main network and thus&#13;
eliminating a number of polluting, low-efficiency, low-stack, coal-fired small&#13;
boilers by installing necessary transmission lines and substations;&#13;
(f)    isolating two base load boilers at the Ganibu plant from poor quality DH&#13;
circulation water by installing heat exchangers to improve their life expectancy&#13;
in heavy fuel oil use from 3 years to 15 years;&#13;
(g)    installing heat production and fuel meters and inproving the automation systems&#13;
at the main boiler plants;&#13;
(h)    installing oxygen analyzers in all major boiler plants to increase combustion&#13;
efficiency;&#13;
(i)    installing heat meters in about 550 district heated buildings; and&#13;
(j)    providing equipment and tools for the workshop and mobile maintenance units&#13;
in order to upgrade the maintenance function and introduce modem maintenance&#13;
management concepts.&#13;
A detailed description of the component is in Annex 1 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
Given anticipated privatization of the housing stock in Jelgava in the near future; during negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from the City of Jelgava that ownership of all district heating equipment,&#13;
wherever located, would be vested in JDHC (para 6.1 (ii)).&#13;
Institutional Support Program&#13;
3.8          To ensure successful and sustainable implementation of the project and also assist JDHC&#13;
in its conmnercialization efforts, a package of support services has been included in the project. During&#13;
project preparation, substantial technical assistance was provided to both JDHC and the City of Jelgava&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                                                                             The Project&#13;
through the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development (PHRD) fund. The TA included: (i) a&#13;
study tour to two project sites in Poland currently implementing DH rehabilitation programs with&#13;
assistance from the World Bank; (ii) financial audit of JDHC; (iii) organizational and regulatory&#13;
effectiveness; CIv) tariff formulation; and (v) provisions for training and office equipment, computers and&#13;
software. Further institutional support would be provided under the project, including: (a) detailed project&#13;
design and supervision; (b) procurement and disbursement advisory services; (c) efficiency improvements&#13;
in accounting and commercial systems, including the billing and collection system; (d) procurement&#13;
training; and (e) a twinning arrangement with another DH company to assist JDHC in developing&#13;
effective procedures and practices and to better ensure sustainable institutional development.&#13;
D. Cost Estimate and Financing Plan&#13;
3.9           Project Costs. Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies but&#13;
excluding interest during construction and taxes, are estimated at US$ 15.2 million equivalent of which&#13;
US$ 12.3 million, or about 81 percent, is the foreign exchange cost. Cost estimates are based on October&#13;
1994 prices. Physical contingencies were estimated at 15 percent of base cost on all items except&#13;
technical assistance services. Price contingencies were estimated using standard average foreign inflation&#13;
of 2.2 percent per year, and local inflation estimated at 20 percent for 1995, and 6 percent for each year&#13;
thereafter. Average price contingencies are 9 percent of total base costs. Local taxes are estimated at&#13;
about Lat 0.3 million (US$0.6 million equivalent) and represent about 4 percent of the total project costs.&#13;
Interest during construction is estimated at US$2.4 million. Summary project costs are shown in Table&#13;
3.1 and detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 2 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.10          Project Financing. The proposed World Bank loan of US$14.0 million equivalent would&#13;
cover about 79 percent of the total financing requirement, including US$2.2 million of interest during&#13;
construction but excluding taxes and duties. The Government of Sweden, through BITS, would provide&#13;
grants of US$0.5 million equivalent, and the Borrower would finance US$3.7 million equivalent.&#13;
Financing arrangements are shown in Table 3.2. The funds from BITS would finance the provision of&#13;
detailed engineering design and implementation supervision under the institutional support component.&#13;
Local financing would be covered by JDHC internal cash generation, with the City of Jelgava retaining&#13;
the residual obligation for the funds.&#13;
3.11          The relatively high proportion of the Bank's contribution to project financing is justified&#13;
because JDHC has had no opportunity to build up cash reserves given lack of full cost recovery tariffs&#13;
in pre-independent Latvia combined with the energy price shocks during the transition period. In order&#13;
to alleviate the company's weak cash position, the project is designed to gradually phase in full cost&#13;
recovery tariffs, and thus enable JDHC to build up financial reserves. In order to ensure that local funds&#13;
are available to implement the project according to the agreed implementation plan, assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that in the first instance, the City of Jelgava, and in the second, the Borrower&#13;
would undertake the residual obligation for local funding if JDHC is unable to generate needed funds for&#13;
the proposed investment (para 6.1 (iii)).&#13;

3.12          Flow of Funds and On-Lending. The World Bank loan of US$14.0 million equivalent&#13;
would be made to the Republic of Latvia and on-lent to the City of Jelgava to support the financing of&#13;
the rehabilitation of the Jelgava DH system. The loan would be made at the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate with a 17 year maturity and 5 year grace period; and a 0.75 percent commitment charge, less&#13;
any applicable waiver. The proceeds of the proposed loan would be passed on to the City of Jelgava at&#13;
the World Bank variable interest rate plus a 10 percent mark-up to cover cross-currency risk and loan&#13;
administrative costs and would be repaid over 17 years, including 5 years grace. The foreign exchange&#13;
risk is expected to be borne directly by the City of Jelgava. The City of Jelgava would pass on the&#13;
proceeds of the loan to its district heating enterprise. During negotiations, agreement was obtained&#13;
concerning the on-lending arrangement for the project (para 6.1 (iv)). Signature of the subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement between the Borrower and the City of Jelgava and the sub-loan agreement between the City&#13;
of Jelgava and JDHC would be a condition of effectiveness (para 6.2).&#13;
3.13         Retroactive Financing. A provision for retroactive financing up to a total of US$1.17&#13;
million has been made for expenditures incurred after appraisal but before loan signing. The City of&#13;
Jelgava has expressed a very strong interest in utilizing the retroactive financing provision and estimates&#13;
that it currently has provisions in its budget for up to 300,000 Lats (US$550,000 equivalent) to undertake&#13;
rehabilitation works on critical sections of the transmission network beginning early summer 1995.&#13;
3.14         Inflation and Interest Rates. Inflation rates in Latvia, as measured by changes in the&#13;
Consumer Price Index, were about 951 percent in 1992, 109 percent in 1993 and 36 percent in 1994.&#13;
Domestic inflation in Latvia is forecasted at about 20 percent in 1995, and at 6 percent thereafter. Short&#13;
term credit is now available through the conmmercial banking system at interest rates which have kept&#13;
ahead of inflation. Long-term investment loans, however, are currently not available in Latvia through&#13;
the commercial banking system. The interest rate on long-term investment loans provided by the&#13;
multilateral and bilateral Banks are therefore the only proxies for appropriate interest rate. The proposed&#13;
on-lending interest rate of the IBRD interest rate plus a mark-up margin of 10% is considered reasonable,&#13;
and is also in line with on-lending interest rates under the recently approved World Bank Liepaja&#13;
Environment Loan.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
3.15          Procurement will be administered by JDHC with assistance from  international&#13;
procurement consultants, whose responsibilities will include: (a) training of selected staff and developing&#13;
monitoring procedures for their use in managing procurement and disbursement; (b) assisting with&#13;
preparing specific bid documents based on the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for goods, including&#13;
notification of bidding opportunities; c) participating in the evaluation of bids and proposals received and&#13;
in the preparation of evaluation reports; d) advising on contracts with successful bidders and selected&#13;
consultants.&#13;
3.16          Procurement Procedures. Prior to independence, Latvia did not have a tradition of&#13;
competitive bidding for the public procurement of goods and services. Since independence, commercial&#13;
practices for procurement have been introduced. A Country Procurement Assessment Note is planned for&#13;
late 1995. The Government is now in the process of preparing legislation instituting public procurement&#13;
rules and regulations as part of its comprehensive program to transform its economy from a centrally&#13;
planned to a market-oriented system based on the development of a competitive private sector.&#13;
Government expects to present draft legislation for Parliamentary approval in late 1995. For goods,&#13;
works, and services financed under the loan, the Government will follow the World Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          21&#13;
3.17         The General Procurement Notice for the project was issued immediately following&#13;
appraisal. A summary of procurement arrangements is given in Table 3.3. A detailed procurement&#13;
implementation plan is included as Annex 3 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.18         Procurement Methods: Except as noted below, contracts for the supply of goods and&#13;
equipment estimated to cost more than US$300,000, up to an aggregate of US$9.5 million, shall be&#13;
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The number of ICB contracts&#13;
is expected to total eleven, of which seven are expected to include installation and/or supervision.&#13;
3.19         For ICB contracts, local manufacturers may be granted a domestic preference in bid&#13;
evaluation equivalent to 15 percent of the CIF price or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower;&#13;
provided that the local component of the goods exceeds 30 percent of their total value. Given the nature&#13;
of the goods and equipment to be procured, however, participation and competitiveness of local firms is&#13;
expected to be limited. Contracts for the supply of goods and equipment estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$300,000, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$1.8 million, will be awarded through&#13;
International Shopping (IS) on the basis of quotations to be obtained from a minimum of 3 suppliers from&#13;
at least 2 countries, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for the procurement&#13;
of items or groups of items costing less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate of US$200,000, may be&#13;
awarded on the basis of National Shopping (NS),on the basis of at least 3 quotations obtained from three&#13;
different eligible suppliers, depending on the availability of such items in Latvia. Goods and equipment&#13;
which are determined to be proprietary in nature, and acceptable to the Bank, may be procured on the&#13;
basis of direct contracting with suppliers. The aggregate total amount of such contracts, however, is not&#13;
expected to exceed US$1 million.&#13;
3.20         Contracts for installation and civil works, estimated at US$3.0 million equivalent, will&#13;
be financed by JDHC and the City of Jelgava, and undertaken partly through force account and partly&#13;
through local sub-contractual arrangements.&#13;
3.21         Advance Procurement: Advance procurement action for the procurement of a critical&#13;
section of pipe due for installation in summer of 1995 is expected to begin after negotiations. This&#13;
contract, to be procured through International Shopping (IS), would be eligible for retroactive financing&#13;
once the loan becomes effective. Additional procurement actions may also be initiated prior to loan&#13;
effectiveness. (See para 3.13 for retroactive financing provisions.)&#13;
3.22         Consulting Services: Most consulting services for engineering design and supervision, as&#13;
well as the procurement consultant, are expected to be financed through bilateral sources and will be&#13;
contracted according to their respective procedures. A limited amount of consulting services is expected&#13;
to be financed utilizing Bank funds, and shall be procured in accordance with the Bank guidelines on the&#13;
use of consultants.&#13;
3.23         Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank: Bank prior review would be required&#13;
for all ICB packages. The Bank will also require prior review of the invitations to quote and proposed&#13;
contracts for the first three contracts procured through International Shopping. Any contract awarded&#13;
after direct negotiations with suppliers would also be subject to Bank prior review. Prior review by the&#13;
Bank is estimated to cover about 75 percent of the Bank loan.&#13;
3.24         Procurement Monitoring and Reporting: The Borrower will establish procedures for&#13;
monitoring procurement implementation, including monitoring contract modifications, variations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22                                                                            The Project&#13;
extension of completion periods. The borrower will maintain detailed records of procurement activities&#13;
under the loan and keep the Bank inforned about the progress of the procurement actions through&#13;
submitting regular quarterly progress reports.&#13;

F. Disbursemnent&#13;
3.25   The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against the categories summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
The disbursement schedule is given at Annex 5. It is expected that disbursements would be completed&#13;
by June 2000, about 6 months after expected completion of equipment supply and installation. A&#13;
comparison cannot be made to standard disbursement profiles for DH projects, as only three Bank loans&#13;
have been made to-date for projects of this nature and they are still under implementation. The&#13;
disbursement schedule is considered realistic, given that a substantial portion of the design work and&#13;
preparation of technical specifications and tender documents will have already been completed before&#13;
implementation begins in summer 1995.&#13;

3.26         Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, JDHC would establish a&#13;
Special Account (SA) in a major commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the World&#13;
Bank. The authorized initial allocation would be US$500,000. At the request of the Borrower, and&#13;
based on project needs, the World Bank would make an initial deposit or deposits into the SA up to the&#13;
amount of the authorized allocation. Applications for the replenishment of the SA would be submitted&#13;
monthly, or whenever one-third of the amcount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the usual World Bank procedures. In&#13;
addition, monthly bank statements of the SA, which have been reconciled by JDHC, would accompany&#13;
all replenishment applications.&#13;
3.27         Statements of Expenditure (SOE) would be used on goods contracts valued at US$300,000&#13;
or less; and for consultant services valued at US$100,000 or less for firms or US$50,000 for individuals.&#13;
JDHC would retain the supporting documentation and make it available for inspection by World Bank&#13;
supervision missions and by external auditors. The minimum size of the application for Direct Payment&#13;
and Special Commitment procedures is US$50,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.28         The accounting for all SA transactions and for all other project-related accounts will be&#13;
maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual audits of all World Bank-&#13;
financed components prepared by qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and in accordance&#13;
with international auditing guidelines, will be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the&#13;
close of JDHC's fiscal year (para 4.15).&#13;
G. Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
3.29         Project Preparation. All components of the project have been the object of feasibility&#13;
studies which are complete. Lists of equipment and cost estimates have been provided, and reviewed&#13;
fully at appraisal. Detailed design, technical specifications and preparation of bidding documents are&#13;
required for many elements of the project and work on these have already begun.&#13;
3.30         Project Implementation. The project would be implemented by JDHC. Assistance in&#13;
project administration and coordination would be provided by the City of Jelgava. Additional support for&#13;
project management, procurement and disbursement would be provided through the institutional support&#13;
package financed under the project. A Coordinator in the Energy Division, Ministry of Economy has&#13;
been appointed to liaise with the various ministries, donors, the City of Jelgava, and JDHC. A detailed&#13;
project implementation action plan is attached as Annex 4 of the Implementation Volume. A summary&#13;
of the implementation plan is at Annex 4 of this report.&#13;
H. Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
3.31         The monitoring of the project will be accomplished through the milestones shown in the&#13;
implementation charts and key performance indicators. Key project performnance indicators, (Annex 9&#13;
of the Implementation Volume), were agreed at negotiations and reflected in the minutes of negotiations&#13;
(para 6.1 (v)). Given the pilot nature of the project, close monitoring will be essential to ensure that&#13;
lessons learnt are documented and available for application at other locations. Support would be provided&#13;
to the Energy Division, Ministry of Economy to design and implement a monitoring and reporting&#13;
program for the project. Semi-annual progress reports, covering all components of the project, will be&#13;
submitted by the Project Coordinator in the Energy Division, Ministry of Economy to the World Bank.&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtained, and reflected in the minutes of negotiations, that a mid-&#13;
term report will be submitted to the Bank not later than September 30, 1997, to allow time fbr review&#13;
before the mid-term review, planned for November 1997 (para 6.1 (vi)). An Implementation Completion&#13;
Report (ICR) will be submitted to the Bank promptly after the completion of the project but in any event&#13;
not later than six months after the Loan Closing Date. Included in the ICR will be an assessment of: the&#13;
execution and initial operation of the project, its costs and benefits derived or to be derived, the&#13;
performance of the Borrower and the World Bank and other agencies involved on their respective&#13;
obligations and accomplishments, and lessons learned.&#13;
I. Project Supervision&#13;
3.32         In addition to regular supervision for the review of procurement actions during project&#13;
implementation, semi-annual reports, and other documentation, supervision missions will be planned as&#13;
required. Owing to the lack of experience of the borrower with Bank project implementation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                             25&#13;
procurement rules, the project is expected to require a supervision effort from the Bank at an average of&#13;
20 staff-weeks in the first year, about 17 staff-weeks in the second year, and thereafter, 10 staff-weeks&#13;
per fiscal year.  A project launch workshop is scheduled to take place immediately following&#13;
effectiveness. The Supervision Plan is shown in Annex 7.&#13;
J. Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.33         Environmental Review Process.  Preparation of the proposed project has included&#13;
enviromnental studies consistent with the requirements of the Latvian law on "State Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessments" (1990) and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment." In accordance with these procedures an environmental review was prepared, consistent&#13;
with the requirements for a category "B" project for the district heat rehabilitation program in Jelgava.&#13;
The institutional support program was placed in category "C" and did not require environmental analysis.&#13;
The findings of these environmental studies have been used to support design of the specific programs,&#13;
and mitigation and monitoring activities have been identified. The findings of these studies, proposed&#13;
mitigation and monitoring activities, and recommended institutional strengthening actions are presented&#13;
in Annex 8 of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.34         Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures.  Implementation of the&#13;
proposed project is anticipated to have positive envirommental benefits through improved efficiency in the&#13;
use of fuels, by contributing to a reduced level of air pollution in Jelgava, and by reducing the wastage&#13;
of water used in the district heating systems.&#13;
3.35         The project was subject to an environmental review which concluded that the proposed&#13;
program of improvements would have an overall positive environmental impact by improving air quality&#13;
during the heating season and reducing the wastage of water. The program would yield environmental&#13;
improvements through increasing the energy efficiency of the DH system, both by better integration of&#13;
the heating system, and by major rehabilitation activities which would reduce fuel use, and create&#13;
economic incentives for energy conservation. Key interventions include: closing four small coal fired&#13;
boiler plants and replacing them with block substations, which would reduce local air pollution and&#13;
eliminate the requirement for coal and ash storage, as well as ash disposal; and rehabilitation of the&#13;
distribution network which would reduce the wastage of water and increase the energy efficiency of the&#13;
heating system.&#13;
3.36         The environmental review assessed potential impacts associated with fuel combustion,&#13;
system rehabilitation, and waste disposal. In the older parts of the system, especially the boilers and&#13;
distribution network, asbestos has been used as an insulating material; therefore measures need to be&#13;
taken to minimize the risks to workers involved in the removal of this material. In addition, steps need&#13;
to be taken to assure that it is properly and safely disposed of, in consultation with environmental&#13;
authorities. Under the project, technical assistance would be provided to the Ministry of Environment&#13;
and Regional Development for the preparation of asbestos management guidelines, which would be&#13;
developed in coordination with relevant health and occupational safety authorities. These guidelines&#13;
would be complemented by technical assistance to assist the borrower in the preparation of a project-&#13;
specific asbestos removal and disposal plan which would require formal review and approval by&#13;
environmental authorities. Initial contacts with donors indicate interest in bilateral financing of this aspect&#13;
of the project which is expected to begin no sooner than the summer of 1996. These actions have been&#13;
included as elements of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan prepared for this component.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower, acting through the Ministry of Environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26                                                                       The Project&#13;
and Regional Development, would by June 30, 1996; prepare an enviromnental mitigation and monitoring&#13;
plan, including an implementation timetable for the project, satisfactory to the Bank (para 6.1 (vii)).&#13;

Financial Aspects                                                                      27&#13;
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Past and Present Financial Performance&#13;
4.1          The period of economic transition has been one of major change for the energy sector&#13;
in Latvia. The ongoing energy sector restructuring efforts, energy price shocks combined with major&#13;
revisions of the national accounting system have led to structural changes in the financial structure of DH&#13;
enterprises. Historical statements are therefore not readily comparable from year to year. The lack of&#13;
comparability is made more pronounced by distorted asset values resulting from recent high inflation rates&#13;
which have eroded the book value of assets which is only partially countered by periodic indexation of&#13;
whole classes of assets. As a result, past financial statements presented in the report are of limited value&#13;
in making projections or gauging trends.&#13;
4.2          During 1993, the first year for which financial data exists, JDHC sustained an operating&#13;
loss which was only partially covered by Government subsidies. The unexpected harshness of the&#13;
1993/1994 winter led to further deterioration of JDHC's financial position as the company was forced&#13;
to increase heat production considerably to provide a minimum level of comfort for consumers. The&#13;
difference between actual cost of heat supply and approved tariff for 1994 was covered by the City of&#13;
Jelgava as a subsidy to the district heating enterprise. The subsidy is expected to be applied to the&#13;
reduction of JDHC's debt to the gas utility. A plan for resolution of the debt is expected to be finalized&#13;
following the recommendation of the Central Government committee currently working on resolution of&#13;
outstanding arrears of consumers to the gas utility. The expected output from the committee is a realistic&#13;
repayment plan for each consumer category. The past and present financial performance of JDHC is&#13;
presented in Annex 7 of the Implementation Volume. A summary of the financial data is presented in&#13;
Table 4.1.&#13;
B. Heat Tariffs. Collection Performance. and Social Safety Net&#13;
4.3           Tariffs. Heat tariffs for the City of Jelgava are set by the City Council from a proposal&#13;
submitted by the district heating company. In the event that the Municipal Council and the District&#13;
Heating Company cannot reach agreement on a tariff level, the case is referred to the Tariff Arbitration&#13;
Board in the Ministry of Economy. Since taking over the responsibility for tariff approval in 1993, the&#13;
Jelgava City Council has supported the efforts of JDHC to have tariffs at levels that would cover&#13;
operating costs, and no recourse to the Tariff Arbitration Board has been needed.&#13;
4.4          Heat tariffs were revised almost monthly during the 1992/93 heating season to reflect the&#13;
rapid increases in energy input prices and inflation. Between January and October 1992, the tariff for&#13;
industrial consumers increased almost 20-fold. In 1993, the average heat tariff increased by 117 percent,&#13;
by 15 percent in 1994 and is expected to increase by another 16 percent in 1995. Heat tariffs in Jelgava,&#13;
as compared to other locations in Latvia and neighboring Estonia and Lithuania, have tended to be higher&#13;
because of the poor condition of the DH system, JDHC's reliance on natural gas as primary fuel in heat&#13;
production and because there is less subsidization compared to Lithuania. This reliance on natural gas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                                         Financial Aspects&#13;
was engendered by the company's weak cash flow position which made the easy credit terms available&#13;
from the State-owned gas monopoly more attractive than paying up-front for heavy fuel oil purchases.&#13;
JDHC's utilization of natural gas was 75 percent in 1993 decreasing to 52% in 1994, though the natural&#13;
gas cost per unit of heat produced was almost 400 percent higher than heavy fuel oil'. The gradual&#13;
switch from the use of natural gas to less expensive heavy fuel oil, in addition to other efficiency gains,&#13;
will enable JDHC to reduce cost of heat production and thus future tariff increases. Projected tariff&#13;
increases are presented in Table 4.1. During negotiations, a tariff determination formula sufficient to&#13;
allow the JDHC to cover production costs, operations and maintenance, depreciation, interest, and make&#13;
a contribution to reserves was agreed upon. Assurances were also obtained that the City of Jelgava, and&#13;
ultimately the Borrower, would continue to approve regular tariff adjustments based on the agreed&#13;
formula (para 6.1 (viii)). The financial projections and analysis for tariff determination would be carried&#13;
out at the end of each heating season and submitted to the World Bank for review.&#13;
4.5           Collection Performance. The trend in collection performance of JDHC is positive and&#13;
continues to improve. The average collection rate2 in 1992 was 45 percent increasing to 71 percent in&#13;
1993. For the first 9 months of 1994, the collection rate averaged 126 percent indicating that arrears for&#13;
previous years were beginning to be paid off. Of the different consumer categories, municipal agencies&#13;
and institutions had the best payment record. As at October 1, 1994, the City of Jelgava had caused its&#13;
municipal institutions and agencies to clear past arrears for DH services and, in turn paid a total sum of&#13;
Lats 0.73 million (US$1.33 million equivalent). Though many agencies of the central Government have&#13;
made efforts to pay their heating bills and reduce past debts, collection from central Government&#13;
budgetary institutions remains a major problem. However, JDHC has begun disconnection of large&#13;
debtors on a pilot basis. In February 1995, one of the debtor central budgetary institutions was&#13;
disconnected for the remainder of the 1994/95 heating season.&#13;
4.6           The payment performance of industrial consumers has also improved significantly and&#13;
the collection rate for the first nine months of 1994 averaged 122 percent indicating that arrears for&#13;
previous years were being paid off. Beginning in 1994, JDHC began to sue delinquent industrial&#13;
consumers in court and has been successful in a number of cases. In addition, the economic upturn in&#13;
the Jelgava area has meant that industrial enterprises are beginning to make profits and are thus able to&#13;
pay their heat bills. Further evidence of the economic upturn is reflected in the dramatic increase in 1994&#13;
tax revenues collected by the City of Jelgava which greatly exceeded projections thus enhancing the City's&#13;
financial position.&#13;
4.7           The payment performance of residential consumers has also improved significantly. For&#13;
the first 9 months of 1994, the collection rate for residential consumers averaged 75 percent of 1994&#13;
billings, a significant increase from the 43 percent rate of the previous year. Based on preliminary&#13;
figures, actual receivables for 1994 was about 140 days which is lower than the estimate in the financial&#13;
forecast. The improvement in collection performance can be attributed to the economic upturn and the&#13;
introduction of a targeted social safety net assistance program for the neediest section of the population.&#13;
I/ Based on average prices, equivalent energy prices were Lats 2.06/Gcal for heavy fuel oil and Lats&#13;
8.19/Gcal for natural gas for 1993; and Lats 4.85/Gcal for heavy fuel oil and Lats 7.71/Gcal for gas&#13;
in 1994.&#13;
2/ Collection rate is the ratio of actual revenues collected to actual billing for a given period.&#13;

Financial Aspects                                                                      29&#13;
4.8          Social Safety Net. The low-income household assistance program which is jointly funded&#13;
by the municipal and central governments has made district heating services more affordable for the&#13;
lowest income section of the population. A total of Lats 297,000 (US$0.54 million equivalent) was&#13;
provided for this in the municipal budget for 1994. However, the program has not been wholly successful&#13;
due to social resistance and unwillingness of many potential recipients to be stigmatized as receiving hand-&#13;
outs. Social awareness campaigns at both the national and municipal levels are expected to help reduce&#13;
social resistance and encourage more potential recipients to come forward. Also, the decision by the&#13;
central Government to discontinue the practice of matching funds should enhance effectiveness of the&#13;
program.&#13;
4.9           Future Trends. The improvement in the financial position of the City of Jelgava as well&#13;
as JDHC is expected to continue in the future. The City of Jelgava, along with other large cities in&#13;
Latvia, are experiencing renewed economic growth after years of contraction. The economic turnaround&#13;
in Latvia is supported by IMF economic data which estimates Latvia's real GDP growth at 1 percent in&#13;
1994 following a period of 35 percent and 15 percent contraction in GDP for 1992 and 1993 respectively.&#13;
Projected real growth in GDP for 1995 is estimated at 5 percent. Inflation is forecasted at 20 percent in&#13;
1995, a marked decrease from inflation rates of 951 percent in 1992, 109 percent in 1993, and 36 percent&#13;
in 1994. In addition, household incomes are expected to rise faster than inflation and heat tariffs to&#13;
decrease in real terms over the project implementation period. Real wage growth is estimated at 12&#13;
percent for 1994 after years of decline. The cost of space heating would decrease as a proportion of&#13;
household income thus ensuring affordability and increasing the ability of residential consumers to pay&#13;
their heat bills. Based on 1994 average heat tariff and estimated average monthly wage, district heating&#13;
accounted for about 10 percent of household income in Jelgava.3 The introduction of targeted social&#13;
safety net for low-income households should enable this section of the population to pay their heat bills.&#13;
C. BillinE and Collection&#13;
4.10         The billing system used by JDHC is manual, time consuming and archaic; and is&#13;
described in Annex 5 of the Project Implementation Volume. The JDHC utilizes two billing procedures -&#13;
one for industrial/social institutional consumers and one for household consumers. Billing for&#13;
industrial/social institutions consumers is based on annual contracted consumption in the absence of a heat&#13;
meter. For metered industrial consumers, meter reading is undertaken once a year by the JDHC unless&#13;
discrepancies are observed. Using the predetermined level of consumption, bills are manually prepared&#13;
at the beginning of each month and delivered to the consumers by the middle of the month. According&#13;
to contractual arrangements, the bill is expected to be paid in full by the 20th of the month.&#13;
4.11         The procedure for household consumers is different and relies on consumers to calculate&#13;
the payment due and make deposits at one of eight banks approved by JDHC. Due to limited metering&#13;
of residential buildings, heating bills for household consumers are calculated based on the size of the&#13;
apartment and the number of occupants. Payments received from all consumers are manually recorded&#13;
and transcribed from month to month. This system is extremely time consuming and results in frequent&#13;
errors. Metering of residential heat consumption at the apartment building level is included in the project&#13;
3/ IMF average monthly wage estimate for the state sector for 1994 is Lats 78. Each household is&#13;
estimated to have 1.4 wages earners and heat consumption is estimated at about 8Gcal (equivalent to&#13;
Lats 111.2/year at the 1994 average heat tariff of Lat 13.9/Gcal) per household per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30                                                                         Financial Aspects&#13;
and would greatly enhance billing of DH services. Billing at the appropriate level, the apartment building,&#13;
is essential in enforcing payment through disconnection of delinquent consumers. Trial disconnection of&#13;
delinquent consumers on a substantial scale, during project implementation period may not be feasible&#13;
as current technology makes such efforts practically impossible.&#13;
4.12          As part of the financial audit performed by Price Waterhouse, suggestions for&#13;
improvement of the billing and collection procedure were made. During the transitional period before&#13;
consumer metering is possible accurate billing will remain difficult. JDHC has already taken steps to&#13;
automate billing and consumer accounts. Further technical assistance for the improvement of the billing&#13;
and collection system is provided under the project and is expected to be undertaken within the first year&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.13         Under the Soviet system, Latvian enterprises prepared limited financial statements on a&#13;
cash accounting basis which were used largely as tools for budget allocation under the five-year plans.&#13;
Following independence, Latvia began the transformation of accounting practices to a system more in line&#13;
with the needs of a market economy. The country is now in the process of implementing a new&#13;
accounting system on an accruals basis. Financial statements for all enterprises are expected to be&#13;
produced according to the new system beginning in 1994, although understanding of the new accounting&#13;
system is rather limited. As part of EU-PHARE assistance in Latvia, some training has been provided&#13;
to JDHC in the new accounting system. Further enhancement of JDHC's accounting system is included&#13;
in the project's institutional support package.&#13;
4.14         While assets of DH enterprises are still thought to be undervalued, the current assessment&#13;
is that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a full asset revaluation at this stage, since existing heat&#13;
production facilities have excess capacity due to the large drop in demand over the past several years.&#13;
In addition, poor operational efficiency and outdated technology make an accurate valuation difficult.&#13;
However, once project investments, which are large relative to current asset levels, are commissioned,&#13;
the value of assets would be greatly increased and the cost of heat services would reflect a larger&#13;
depreciation charge and return on investment as the operational efficiency of assets is improved.&#13;
4.15         Project Accounting and Auditing Requirements. A separate project account would be&#13;
required to ensure properly maintained records of all expenditures related to the project. The project&#13;
account would identify all sources and uses of funds in carrying out the project, including a detailed&#13;
accounting of the use of the proceeds of the World Bank loan. An annual audit of the project accounts&#13;
undertaken by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank would be required. The audit report would&#13;
be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The audit report would also&#13;
contain a separate opinion on the statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure, when utilized, and on the&#13;
operation of the Special Account.&#13;
4.16         In order to monitor the financial performance of JDHC, an audit of its financial&#13;
statements by auditors acceptable to the Bank would be required. The audit reports, which would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year, would contain a separate opinion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Financial Aspects                                                                    31&#13;
on compliance with all financial covenants under the Bank Loan. During negotiations agreement was&#13;
reached regarding the auditing requirements of the project.&#13;
E. Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.17         Projections of financial performance of the JDHC for the period 1994-2000 are presented&#13;
in Annex 7 of the Implementation Volume, and summarized in Table 4.1. The projections have been&#13;
prepared on a conservative basis assuming that: (a) heat demand achieved in 2000 is only 80 percent of&#13;
the 1989 demand; (b) JDHC will increase heavy fuel oil utilization from 45 percent in 1994 to 70 percent&#13;
in 2000 with corresponding reduction in natural gas utilization; and (c) fuel prices are at world market&#13;
levels. The detailed demand forecast is presented in Annex 6 of the Implementation Volume. Though&#13;
interest during the project implementation period is to be financed from the World Bank loan, the annual&#13;
amount is charged to operations and is reflected in the calculated tariff. Counterpart funds for the project&#13;
are expected to come from the internal cash generation of JDHC with the City of Jelgava retaining the&#13;
residual obligation for counterpart funds if the JDHC is unable to generate sufficient funds to meet the&#13;
yearly requirements for the project.&#13;
4.18         The financial projections consist of income statements, sources and applications of funds&#13;
statements and balance sheets along with financial performance indicators. The financial analysis indicates&#13;
that the proposed investment will greatly enhance the financial performance of JDHC and enable it to reduce&#13;
operating costs and tariffs. Over the period covered by the financial projections, average heat tariffs would&#13;
decrease in real terms as the effect of fuel substitution reduces the proportion of fuel cost in the cost structure&#13;
from about 60 percent in 1993 to about 40 percent in 2000, and the efficiency gains from the project are&#13;
reaized. JDHC's operating ratio is expected to decrease from over 100 percent in 1994 to about 79 percent&#13;
by the year 2000. Average tariffs are calculated to ensure sufficient funds availability for local cost&#13;
contribution and adequate working capital, and minimum debt service coverage of 1.3. Though JDHC has&#13;
only one outstanding loan, its high accounts receivable and payable positions could have adverse effects on&#13;
the company's finances. In order to protect JDHC's financial position, agreement was obtained at negotiations&#13;
from the City of Jelgava, that it would continue to approve DH tariffs at levels sufficient to and/or otherwise&#13;
cause JDHC to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 during the project period (para 6.1 (ix)).&#13;
To properly monitor financial performance, agreement was also obtained that the City of Jelgava would&#13;
require its DH Company to prepare rolling 5-year financial projections, beginning FY96 to be reviewed by&#13;
the Bank on an annual basis (para 6.1 (x)).&#13;

V. PROJICT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Justification&#13;
5.1           Heat is a basic human need in northern climates. Although district heating is not the only&#13;
means of meeting the need, it has been the preferred option for densely populated areas throughout the&#13;
FSU. Individual building unit boilers burning natural gas and/or light fuel oil are also used in smaller&#13;
towns and for buildings too far from district heating heat sources. In the project design, alternative ways&#13;
of providing heat to the residents of Jelgava City were examined to determine whether rehabilitation of&#13;
the district heating system was the least cost solution. The analysis confirms that, for reasons of both&#13;
cost and practicality, rehabilitation of the district heating system is the optimal solution for the time being.&#13;
5.2           A number of options were considered. First, installation of individual boilers in each&#13;
apartment: this is considered unsafe because the present buildings have not been designed to permit&#13;
removal of flue gas. Individual chimneys for each boiler would need to be provided, which would prove&#13;
either prohibitively expensive and/or practically impossible as most apartment buildings in Jelgava do not&#13;
have chimneys in each apartment unit. Second, installation of large gas-fired boilers for groups of&#13;
apartment buildings: this alternative proved substantially more expensive than the proposed rehabilitation&#13;
as it would require extensive rehabilitation of the highly-corroded four pipe network of the existing DH&#13;
system.&#13;
5.3           The option examined in greatest detail was installation of individual gas-fired boilers for&#13;
each apartment building. This alternative would be more expensive than rehabilitation of the DH network&#13;
for Jelgava for several reasons. First, the base cost of installing a gas-fired system in Jelgava would be&#13;
a minimum of US$20 million and at least US$5 million for extension of the natural gas network under&#13;
this option, since additional capital costs would have to be incurred, on the one hand to connect the 43&#13;
percent of households served by the district heating network who do not currently have a natural gas&#13;
connection, and on the other to modify buildings to accept gas boilers. This base cost is 69 percent&#13;
higher than the base cost of US$11.8 million' for the district heating rehabilitation alternative. Second,&#13;
other costs, which are difficult to quantify, would be incurred to keep the existing district heating system&#13;
running during the period before all homes currently supplied with district heating are equipped with gas&#13;
boilers. Given the practical difficulties related to unclear property rights, which may take a lengthy&#13;
period to resolve, these additional costs could become large. Third, the switch to a space heating system&#13;
solely dependent on natural gas would be politically unacceptable to both the City of Jelgava and the&#13;
Latvian Government for security of supply reasons as long it relies on a single supplier of natural gas.&#13;
Dual-fired (gas and light fuel oil) boilers could be installed to reduce this political risk, but it is estimated&#13;
that they would cost at least 20 percent more, raising the base cost to US$24 million, twice the base cost&#13;
of the district heating system rehabilitation.2&#13;
1/ This base cost figure excludes technical assistance .&#13;
2/ In addition to higher capital costs, such an option would generate higher fuel costs, since light fuel&#13;
oil is about 30 percent more expensive than natural gas. Based on average 1994 prices in Latvia, the&#13;
equivalent energy prices are: Heavy Fuel oil @ US$8.97/Gcal, Light Fuel Oil (Diesel) @&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                                                                 Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
5.4          In addition, analysis was also carried out of the relative economic costs of fuels that&#13;
would be used in the various options; these are heavy fuel oil, gas and light fuel oil. The analysis,&#13;
tentative though it has to be in the current situation, confirms that the district heating rehabilitation is the&#13;
optimal solution. nhe economic cost of heat to consumers from individual gas boilers is closely linked&#13;
to the long run marginal cost of gas. The long run marginal cost depends to a significant extent on&#13;
additional investment needs of the rehabilitation of the existing gas storage, transnission, and distribution&#13;
system; introduction of seasonality in gas pricing by Russia, the current gas supplier to Latvia; and any&#13;
additional investments the Latvian Government may decide to make to ensure security of supply. The&#13;
economic cost of gas supply to residential consumers would include the higher fixed cost of additional&#13;
equipment required to supply gas at low pressure, and the relatively labor-intensive nature of residential&#13;
gas distribution. Given the uncertainty in many of the above factors, it is difficult to provide a firm&#13;
estimate of the long rmu economic cost of gas supply for residential heating in Latvia. However, it is&#13;
unlikely to be lower than the current cost of US$S18/tcm and depending on rehabilitation and new&#13;
investment costs, could be 30-70 percent higher. On this basis, it can be concluded that a gas-based&#13;
system would be relatively unattractive, on the basis of both capital costs and fuel costs.&#13;
5.5          The results of the above analyses are to be expected, since the sizing of the Jelgava&#13;
district heating system corresponds very closely to optimal sizing and heat load density according to&#13;
Scandinavian design norms. The load density of the Jelgava DH system of 2.1MW/km of network lies&#13;
at the upper end of the Scandinavian design norm of 1.0 - 2.5 MW/km.&#13;
B. PrEoect Beneflts&#13;
5.6          The proposed project would have significant economic benefits related to: (a) extension&#13;
of the usefUl life of the district heating system; (b) reductions in fuel costs and other operational costs;&#13;
(c) improvements in environmental conditions through saved fuel and a cleaner fuel base; and (d) various&#13;
non-quantifiable benefits related to institutional and management improvements. Details of the benefits&#13;
are provided below and summarized in Annex 6.&#13;
5.7          Economic Benefits The economic benefits for the project are based on estimates for the&#13;
following categories.&#13;
(a)    Energy SayiW   Energy savings would come from four sources: first, reduced&#13;
network heat losses through installation of plastic-jacketed, pre-insulated pipes and&#13;
use of automatic temperature control for domestic hot water and radiator circulation&#13;
water; second, better dispatching and lower water supply temperatures through the&#13;
introduction of variable flow and heat metering; third, boiler automation and&#13;
installation of oxygen analyzers for improved combustion efficiency; and fourth,&#13;
elimination of low-efficiency small boilers.&#13;
(b)    System life extension Because of the high ground water conditions in Jelgava,&#13;
replacement of highly corroded sections of the existing network, which have been&#13;
assessed as having a remaining life of less than six years, with pre-insulated pipes&#13;
US$18.05/Gcal, Gas @ US$13.92/Gcal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Benefits and Risks                                                                  35&#13;
will increase the average lifetime of the replaced network sections to at least 30&#13;
years. Lifetime of the rest of the network will also improve due to improved water&#13;
quality and maintenance. Installation of hydraulic separation heat exchangers and&#13;
improvement in water quality are expected to extend the average life of the boilers&#13;
from the current 5 years to at least 10 years. These benefits will translate into&#13;
lower annual replacement costs and maintenance expenditures. (See Annex 6 for&#13;
details of the methodology used to calculate the incremental benefits.)&#13;
(c)     Reduction in water losses  Replacement of old pipes and other leaky network&#13;
components would reduce water losses from the present level of 2 percent of the&#13;
total water outflow from the main heat sources to 1 percent.&#13;
(d)     Air Pollution Abatement Elimination of four small coal-fired boilers would help&#13;
reduce emissions of particulates and SO2 in the City of Jelgava.&#13;
5.8           Economic Analysis An economic evaluation, based on incremental costs and benefits,&#13;
was undertaken for the project. Details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 6, together with&#13;
key assumptions. All costs are expressed in 1994 constant economic prices, net of taxes and subsidies;&#13;
and the evaluation period is 1995-2015. The economic evaluation yields an economic rate of return of&#13;
24 percent.&#13;
5.9           Sensitivity Analysis Calculations were carried out to test the robustness of the project&#13;
and to analyze the sensitivity of the economic rate of return to: (i) a 10 percent investment cost overrun;&#13;
(ii) a 10 percent decrease in benefits; (iii) removal of the quantified air pollution benefits; and (iv) all of&#13;
the above. Switching values (values at which the economic rate of return is reduced to 12 percent) were&#13;
calculated for overall project costs and benefits. Further sensitivity analyses were undertaken for reduction&#13;
in duration of benefit streams to 15 years (1995 - 2009) and 10 years (1995 - 2004). The results are&#13;
presented in table 5.1. Project economic returns are very robust relative to the indicated variations in&#13;
key project parameters. T he switching value analysis suggests that project costs do not pose a significant&#13;
risk because the project remains economically viable, short of almost a doubling of investment costs; and&#13;
benefits would have to almost halve for the project to become non-viable.&#13;

Include: (i) improved operational and managerial performance that will arise out of the organizational and&#13;

Project Benefits and Risks                                                            37&#13;
company; and (v) improvements in technical and commercial performance stemming from training of the&#13;
company's staff and management.&#13;
C. Project Risks&#13;
5.11         Being the first project of its kind for Latvia and Jelgava District Heating Company, the&#13;
project has a number of risks. The implementation capacity of the Company to carry out an investment&#13;
project of this order of magnitude is untested, and may result in a longer implementation period than&#13;
expected. To reduce this risk, detailed implementation arrangements have been fully identified and&#13;
agreed with both the Jelgava District Heating Company (JDHC) and the City of Jelgava. Provisions for&#13;
adequate staffing and implementation support arrangements would be in place prior to project start-up.&#13;
In addition, international and local engineering consultants would assist JDHC with technical&#13;
implementation of the project.&#13;
5.12         There is a risk of heat tariff increases not being implemented for political or other&#13;
reasons. Given the strong demonstration of commitment by the Government, the City of Jelgava and its&#13;
DH Enterprise to adjusting heat tariffs frequently during the recent period of energy price shocks, this&#13;
risk is expected to be relatively small. Monitoring performance in this area would be a major focus of&#13;
attention during Bank supervision.&#13;
5.13         Further uncertainty exists concerning the collection of revenues from consumers. The&#13;
rapid improvement in collection rates of all consumer categories, the upward trend in real wage growth,&#13;
and the introduction of social safety net assistance for low income households all indicate that the risk&#13;
of a renewed build-up of consumer receivables is relatively small.&#13;
&#13;

Jelgava District Heating Rehabilitation Project&#13;
Detailed Economic Analysis&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
1.1          The proposed project would have significant economic benefits related to (a)&#13;
enhancement of district heating system life; (b) reduction of fuel and other operation costs; (c) and&#13;
improvement of environmental conditions through fuel savings and use of cleaner fuel. Details of the&#13;
economic analysis are described in the following paragraphs.&#13;
1.2          Energy Savini  Energy savings will come from three sources:&#13;
(a)    Reduced network heat losses Network heat losses result mainly from the use&#13;
of old and corroded pipes of traditional technology and from water losses.&#13;
The engineering consultants performed field measurements to estimate the&#13;
network heat and leakage losses. Extrapolated to the nominal (i.e. rated&#13;
output) service level, heat losses were estimated at 17% of heat production&#13;
(11 % heat dissipation loss plus 6% heat loss from leaking water). At rated&#13;
output levels in constant flow mode, the average system temperature would be&#13;
some 90-95 IC, (annual average temperature of all supply and return pipes).&#13;
Because of the reduction in consumption and rationing in recent years, the&#13;
network has actually been operating at lower temperatures. The annual&#13;
average system temperature in 1994 was estimated at 65 OC. As a result,&#13;
actual losses were about 65,000 Gcal/annum.&#13;
In the 'without project' case, the average annual system temperature would&#13;
need to be raised to 80 Â°C to achieve the desired service level for the&#13;
estimated annual consumption in 2000. This increase in operating temperature&#13;
would result in annual losses of approximately 74,000 Gcal.&#13;
In the 'with project' case, the improved hydraulic balance of the system&#13;
would enable full service level at lower temperatures (annual average system&#13;
temperature 65Â°C), bringing the losses down to 65,000 Gcal/annum. In&#13;
addition, the elimination of 15 group heat exchanger stations (which would&#13;
save 1000 Gcallannum), 10.5 km of domestic hot water network (which&#13;
would save 5000 Gcal/aznum), half of heat loss from leaking water (wbich&#13;
would save 6000 Gcal/annum) and better thermal insulation in the 31% of the&#13;
network replaced under the project (which would save at least 3000&#13;
Gcal/annum) would reduce losses further to 50,000 Gcal/annum.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
Annual savings of 24,000 Gcal/annum attributable to the above changes would&#13;
amount to US$ 0.25 million.&#13;
(b)   Introduction of variable flow and heat metering Conversion of the system to a&#13;
variable flow regime and introduction of consumer metering would&#13;
substantially increase the efficiency of energy utilization through improved&#13;
dispatching and reduction in specific consumption of consumers. Provision of&#13;
heat meters and automatic control systems is expected to reduce the buildings'&#13;
overheating losses by 43 Tcal per annum (16% of year 2000 estimated&#13;
consumption), representing savings of US$ 0.43 million per annum.&#13;
Improved flow balance achieved by automatic controls and variable speed&#13;
drives is estimated to reduce pumping electricity consumption from the present&#13;
7800 MWh per annum to 2600 MWh per annum (from 3% to 1% of annual&#13;
heat supply expressed in MWh), resulting in annual savings of US$ 0.10&#13;
million.&#13;
(c)    Boiler automation Better load dispatch between boiler units (operation closer&#13;
to optimal efficiency range) due to new automation systems, better combustion&#13;
efficiency due to oxygen analyzers, metering of fuel purchases and heat&#13;
production are estimated to improve overall heat generation efficiency by 5&#13;
percent, resulting in annual savings of US$ 0.20 million.&#13;
1.3           System life extension There are two components of benefits under this heading: first,&#13;
savings in network replacement and maintenance; and second, savings in boiler maintenance and&#13;
replacement. The benefits attributable to the project for both components have been estimated from a&#13;
comparison of expected costs of maintenance and replacement in the "without project" and "with&#13;
project' cases. The estimates have been based on the results of investigations by the engineering&#13;
consultants into the current status of the network and boilers, the extent and nature of maintenance&#13;
and repair works carried out in the past few years, and the life-cycle characteristics of the pipe&#13;
investments to be made under the project.&#13;
1.4          Repair and replacement of pipe sections within the network depend upon the rate at&#13;
which they deteriorate and corrode. The rate of corrosion depends on a number of factors. In a&#13;
modern two-pipe system, such as those where typically pre-insulated pipe is used, the main factor is&#13;
the quality of circulation water; water purification plants ensure low rates of corrosion within the&#13;
pipes. However, in a network like Jelgava's, where non-pre-insulated pipes are installed in non-&#13;
ventilated and poorly-drained concrete channels, the important factors are the extent and duration of&#13;
ground water infiltration into the channels and the quality of circulation water in the network, as well&#13;
as the quality of steel used for the pipes and the quality of installation work. In Jelgava, parts of the&#13;
network are exposed to high ground water levels for various periods of the year, so that pipes corrode&#13;
from outside as well as inside. The rate of corrosion inside the pipes tends to be high not only&#13;
because of deficiencies in the water purification system but also because 30 percent of the network is&#13;
four-pipe and the domestic hot water supplied to end-users is highly corrosive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.5          In a mature network with a stable technology and regular maintenance, requirements&#13;
for maintenance and pipe replacement can be expressed either in terms of system and component life&#13;
cycles or in terms of kilometers of pipe to be replaced annually.! In the case of the Jelgava&#13;
network, estimates of replacement requirements in both 'without project' and 'with project' cases are&#13;
summarized in table 6. 1.&#13;

a/ this part of the network is to Be replaced under the propose prect.&#13;
1/    Thus, a system with a lifecycle of 20 years would normally have 5 percent of its pipes&#13;
replaced annually. Typical values of life cycles are:&#13;
- preinsulated pipe networks with good quality circulation water: 30 years&#13;
- non-pre-insulated pipes in dry, ventilated concrete casings with good quality circulation&#13;
water: 15-30 years&#13;
- non-pre-insulated pipes in concrete casings without proper ventilation and drainage, with&#13;
quality of circulation water of the typical Eastern European or FSU network: 12-15 years&#13;
- non-pre-insulated pipes in concrete casings without proper ventilation and drainage, and&#13;
surrounded by ground water for extended periods: 4-12 years&#13;
- domestic hot water pipes of ferritic steel and corrosive water quality: 5-12 years.&#13;
The above values represent averages for typical systems. In reality, actual life of any&#13;
particular stretch of piping will vary; within a system with an average lifetime of 30 years, therefore,&#13;
some pipe will have a life of as little as 10 years while some will last 50 years or more before&#13;
requiring replacement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1.6          The engineering consultants evaluated the Jelgava network and classified the network&#13;
into four categories. On this basis the kIlometers of pipeline that would need to be replaced annually&#13;
were estimated for both "without project" and "with project' cases. Thus, for the 32 kilometers of&#13;
pipe rated as in "poor" condition, it was estimated that 4 kilometers would have to be replaced&#13;
annually in the "without project" case; in the "with project' case it is assumed that 3.7 kilometers of&#13;
the pipe would require replacement annually because the improvement in the quality of circulation&#13;
water brought about by the project would reduce the rate of corrosion inside the pipes and thereby&#13;
extend the average life of the pipe. In the case of the 22.5 kilometers of pipe that are in most urgent&#13;
need of replacement, categorized as "very poor", and are included within the proposed project, the&#13;
replacement rate in the "with project' case is greatly reduced because a new pipe technology is being&#13;
introduced. Thus, the introduction of pre-insulated pipe will mean that the average lifetime of the&#13;
22.5 kilometers will be 30 years, rather than the current life-span which is well below 10 years, and&#13;
the annual replacement rate declines from 3.8 to 0.75 kilometers.&#13;
1.7          As the table shows, this methodology results in the amount of network to be replaced&#13;
annually, measured in terms of kilometers, declining from 9.5 kilometers per annum in the "without&#13;
project" case to 5.75 kilometers in the 'with project" case. The reduction of 3.75 kilometers per&#13;
annum represents the benefits of the project, and, converted to economic cost savings, amounts to&#13;
US$0.64 million per annum after the completion of the proposed project.&#13;
1.8          Project benefits in the boilers arise from installation of isolation heat exchangers at&#13;
Ganibu boilers to facilitate operation at temperatures above sulfuric acid dew point, improved&#13;
circulation water quality, replacement of circulation pumps equipped with carbon steel impellers by&#13;
pumps equipped with austenitic steel impellers, and improved maintenance throughout the enterprise.&#13;
These are estimated to reduce boiler plant maintenance and equipment replacement costs by US$ 0.93&#13;
million per annum.&#13;
1.9          Reduction in water losses . Replacement of old pipes and other leaky network&#13;
components would reduce water losses from the present 2% of the supply flow to 1 % of the supply&#13;
flow resulting in an annual savings of US$ 0.05 mill. per annum. The corresponding decrease in&#13;
water losses is from the current 240,000m3 to 120,000m3 per annum.&#13;
1.10         Air Pollution Abatement. Elimination of four small coal-fired boilers would help&#13;
reduce emissions of particulates and SO2 in the City of Jelgava. Reduction in sulphur emissions is&#13;
estimated at 128 ton per annum.&#13;
B. Project costs&#13;
1.11         The costs used for estimating the economic rate of return are the total project costs&#13;
over the period 1995-1999, including costs not financed by the Bank, and excluding price&#13;
contingencies, duties and taxes. Estimates of local and foreign costs are in October 1994 prices&#13;
updated to the estimated date of negotiations. Local costs are either directly costed in international&#13;
prices or are converted to US dollars using the average October 1994 exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;

C. Economic rate of return&#13;
1.12         The economic analysis has been carried out by comparing the benefits and costs under&#13;
"without project' and 'with project' scenarios. The 'without project' scenario has been defined as&#13;
continued operation of the system with no change in technology or operating parameters.&#13;
1.13         The project yields an economic rate of return of 24%. Project benefits have been&#13;
calculated as differential of annual fuel, electricity, water, maintenance and equipment replacement&#13;
cost between the alternatives of "with project" and "without project". Program benefits build up in&#13;
proportion to the progress of project implementation to full value in 2000 and remain constant&#13;
thereafter for 15 years. Calculation of the economic rate of return is shown in the table on the next&#13;
page and the sensitivity analysis below in table 6.2.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Jelgava District Heating
            Rehabilitation Project will have the following main
            objectives: 1) to extend the life, and increase the
            operating efficiency, of the Jelgava District Heating (DH)
            System through rehabilitation and introduction of modern
            technologies and materials; 2) to improve environmental
            conditions in affected areas by improving the efficiency of
            fuel use, facilitating the elimination of low-stack
            coal-fired boilers in residential areas, reducing wastage of
            water in DH systems; 3) to support the strengthening and
            restructuring of the Jelgava District Heating Company (JDHC)
            through consultancy and advisory services, training and
            provision of equipment and software; and 4) to act as a
            pilot project for DH system rehabilitation, from soviet-type
            constant flow system to western European technology, for
            other locations within Latvia. The project consists of two
            components: a) rehabilitation of DH system, through a
            program to upgrade the system to a variable flow regime;
            increase boiler efficiency; abate leakages; install heat
            meters; eliminate environmentally unsound, low-stack
            coal-fired boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function;
            and b) institutional support for policy reform, project
            implementation and enterprise restructuring for project agencies.
