                       A CONVERSATION WITH WILLIAM BENNETT                         did not express any such interest.&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                   to meet them, so I brought them up and introduced them to McCloy. It was later&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:    Hr. Bennett, it is a pleasure to have you here.   I wonder if we        interested but more interested than I had previously been. Finally, around&#13;
&#13;
might begin our conversation by your saying a bit about yourself: how you caae     Thanksgiving, I got a definite offer from the Bank for a year.      With the&#13;
&#13;
to the World Bank, and what major categories of things you did when you were       blessing of Mrs. Reid and Norman Stagier (Mrs. Reid was the publisher of       Ih&amp;&#13;
in the Bank.                                                                       Tribune and Norman Stagier was my boss as Business and Financial Editor at the&#13;

&#13;
New York Herald Tribune, where I was Bank Editor.     The Bank at that time was    My principal activity at the Bank was writing a booklet on the Bank, which&#13;
&#13;
having difficulty with the press and the rating services. They were seeking        without a doubt was one of the most frustrating jobs I have ever undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
someone with financial newspaper experience as well as banking, which I did        The other was visiting the rating services to see whether we could convince&#13;
&#13;
have having worked for a bank prior to my newspaper days.     I worked for the     them to rate the World Bank's bonds.&#13;
&#13;
Central Hannover Bank in New York, now the Manufacturer's Hannover, and before     OLIVER:     I take it that you served the Bank in this capacity as a Financial&#13;
&#13;
that with the Emigrant Savings Bank, also ln New York.                             Editor and that you were not preceeded by anybody.&#13;
&#13;
           I actually came into the Bank at the invitation of John J. McCloy,      BENNETT:    No, there was nobody.   There were two of us hired; a fellow named&#13;
&#13;
whom I first met at the Chateau Frontenac in July, 1947. He and my wife and I      Rupert Fuller and I were both hired at the same time.     He was supposed to take&#13;
&#13;
had dinner together.    We had a long chat about salmon fishing in which we were   care of the press, and I was supposed to be a writer of articles, anything&#13;
&#13;
both interested. He asked me if I would be interested in coming to the Bank. I     about the Bank, and to deal with the rating services and other groups which&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     3                                                                                     4&#13;

assess the quality of securities such as bonds, notes, and so on.        Towards the   two of thea, they kept this thing going, and the Bank went out looking hard&#13;
&#13;
end of the year, I was offered a per. .nent position at the Bank by Robert             for a new President. There were people including Graham Tower, the Canadian&#13;
&#13;
Garner, who was then General Manager and Vice President of the Bank,         He had    banker, who were offered the position and turned it down.     Finally, Harry&#13;
&#13;
been Treasurer of what was then the Guaranty Trust    Co~any,   now Morgan             Truman appealed to Winthrop Aldrich at. Chase Bank to nominate somebody who&#13;
&#13;
Guaranty, and, .ore recently, Financial Vice President of General Foods                would take the job as President of the Bank, and McCloy was finally tapped.&#13;
&#13;
Corporation,     He had come to the Bank along with McCloy and Black and a fellow      His firm was, by the way, one of the principal customers of Chase Bank.&#13;
&#13;
named E. Fleetwood Dunstan.     I don't know whether you know who they are.            McCloy agreed to do it under one condition -- that the Board did    n~t   run the&#13;
&#13;
Black came in as Executive Director for the United States succeeding Collado;          day to day operations of the Bank.   The Board was to oversee policy, make&#13;

McCloy caae in from his law firâ&#128;¢ at the behest of Harry Truaan andÂ· Winthrop           policy, but loans and other activities were to come through the staff to the&#13;
&#13;
Aldrich, Chairman of Chase Bank; and E. Fleetwood Dunstan was the Senior               Board rather than the Board down through the staff.    There was a Gentleman's&#13;
&#13;
Vice President in charge of bond iaauea and ao on for Banker' a Trust     Co~any.      Agreement signed, sealed and delivered.   Black was asked to take Collado's&#13;

They were the four who caae in on St. Patrick's day 1947. The Bank aa you know         place. Collado was furious. (This is all heresay).     Finally the whole thing&#13;
&#13;
had had a very difficult ti...     Eugene Meyers had gotten into a row with the        wound up with McCloy aa President, Black as Executive Director for the U.S.,&#13;
&#13;
Board, particularly with E.ilio Collado, the U. S. Director, and Sir James             Bob Garner as Vice President and General Manager and, of course, E. Fleetwood&#13;
Grigg, the U.K. Director, both of whom felt that the Board should be an                Dunstan aa Marketing Director.   That was the group that really ran the Bank&#13;
exe~utive    board that ran the day to day operations of the Bank. Eugene Heyer,       from about St. Patrick's Day, 1947, until approximately July, 1949.       Then&#13;
&#13;
who was the First President of the Bank, disagreed. Everything was in a                Black came in as President, McCloy went off to become U.S. High Commissioner&#13;
&#13;
complete balls up for the first six months of Heyer's tour of duty. He quit on         in Germany, Dunstan returned to Banker's trust, and Bob Garner stayed on for a&#13;
&#13;
December 16, 1946.     Shortly thereafter, the Vice President of the Bank, who         number of years and finally retired in 1961 as President of the International&#13;
&#13;
was acting President, dropped dead in his office.     So the Bank was without a        Finance Corporation.&#13;

head. It was run by a committee headed by a lawyer, whose name totally escapes         OLIVER:   In any event, you were initially assigned the task of trying to get a&#13;

OLIVER:     Chester McLain.                                                            BENNETT: That is correct.   The task was made more difficult particularly by&#13;
BENNETT:     Chester McLain ran the Bank along with a couple of other people.          Moodys. Moodys had, and still has as far as I know, a policy that it will not&#13;

&#13;
Vogelius (later he and I became very good friends) was adamant that he would        to get the Bank known.&#13;
&#13;
not rate the World Bank's bonds.    I went to see him a number of times,      A          I must have heard McCloy speak on the Bank at least 25 or 30 times over a&#13;
&#13;
fellow naued Max Brubaker, who was Vogellua' assistant, agreed with me that         period of a few months. Occasionally it was Black or Dunstan.     They really&#13;

Moody's should.   The Bank was a beast of a different kind.     It was a great      covered the waterfront.   Even then there were an awful lot of people who&#13;

economies of the less-developed countries.      It should be given special          was that the first blow of a depression would put it out of business.     Of&#13;
&#13;
consideration.    Ultimately Vogellua agreed.   He gave us an A rating.      Tony   course you know the Bank operates on the principle that there will never be&#13;
&#13;
Zoller had very much the same view at Standard and Poora.     He finally broke      another depression (it knows that there is likely to be) and that there will&#13;
&#13;
down and gave us an A rating.    Meanwhile, the fellows at Fitch Investors          never be another World War.   If you take both of those into consideration, you&#13;
&#13;
Service had already rated the bonds A. At the time the only bonds outstanding       would never be able to run a World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
were the 150 million of three-year bonds at 3 percent, 100 million of 2 1/4         OLIVER:    So the point is that McCloy really had no money at the time of the&#13;
&#13;
percent ten-year bonds and 100 million of 2 percent twelve-year serial bonds.       institution of the Marshall Plan.   It was impossible to proceed with anything&#13;
&#13;
There were about 350 million dollars in bonds outstanding when this was going       like the order of magnitude of the flow.&#13;
&#13;
on.   Later on the Bank aold literally billions of dollars, but without the         BENNETT:   The only funds that the Bank really had at that time was 20 percent&#13;
&#13;
ratings it would have been very expensive.                                          of the U. S. capital subscription. The U.S. subscription was about 3 billion&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I'm surprised the rating services didn't move immediately to triple A    dollars.    It had about 6 or 7 hundred million dollars from the U. S., a small&#13;
&#13;
bonds in view of the backing of the United State governaent.                        amount from Canada, and that was it.   All of Europe was locked up.    They&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:   Well, nobody wants to collect on a guarantee.    Guarantees take time    couldn't afford unrequited exports at that time.   They were dying for dollars&#13;
&#13;
to collect. If you have a bond of an issue that goes down the tube, you want        or exchangeable currencies to purchase goods and services to replace the&#13;
&#13;
your money back fast. It takes time.    Why put money into something that is        wreckage of the war or the obsolescence caused by war.   The Bank could not&#13;
&#13;
going down the tube no matter what warranty or guarantee it has. Nobody knew        have met the need, particularly at that time.   It had to go to the market.&#13;
&#13;
anything about the Bank's bonds.    I remember when people used to laugh when       The first loans were made in Hay of '47.   They lent 250 million to France, 195&#13;
&#13;
you mentioned the World Bank back during my newspaper day.     You could never      million to Netherlands, 40 million to Denmark, and (I've forgotten, I think it&#13;
&#13;
find out anything from Heyer. People used to think it was a joke, literally,        was) 15 or 20 million to Luxembourg-- all just for basic needs such as&#13;
&#13;
until HcCloy and Black and Dunstan took hold and really knocked themselves out      transportation and steel, in other words replacing infrastructure in basic&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       7                                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
industry.     That just about cleaned the Bank out.     By the tiae they got               to be a very difficult to lend for.     It was always hard to find whom to lend&#13;
&#13;
through, there was $490 million on loan altogether out of about $600 million               to.   It was easy enough to lend to an enormous, multi-purpose dam for flood&#13;
&#13;
ln available funds.                                                                        control and irrigation and so on.     But it was no good if there was nobody down&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     You stayed much longer than a year.                                            stream who had any money to put into equipment needed to use the facility.&#13;

BENNETT:     I stayed 29 1/2 years and then worked on the Bank for a number of             This was one of the things that George Woods became very adept at -- this&#13;
&#13;
years thereafter as a consultant.     It was a fascinating place to work.       1          lending to agricultural credit institutions that took care of the credit needs&#13;
&#13;
worked hard, but I loved every minute of it. I had a wonderful tlâ&#128;¢e.                       of the farmer or other entrepreneur who was using the fruits of the big,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Does anything stand out ln your aemory of the Black and McCloy years?          multi-purpose projects.    In the beginning that was not seen.&#13;
&#13;
(I'a anxious to get on to the Woods' years. of course, but let's not go too                OLIVER:    What was the secret of Woods' success in arranging agricultural&#13;

BENNETT:     Well, I think one of the .are interesting tl.aa in the early '50s             BENNETT:    Well, it had been done before, but he expanded it.    There was very&#13;
&#13;
was the transition froa lending to highly sophisticated countries (France,                 little that George did that hadn't been tried previously by the Black regime,&#13;
&#13;
Netherlands, Australia and places like that) and beginning to lend to the                  except that the scale increased as Woods went along.       The demands on the Bank&#13;
&#13;
less-developed countries.     The first development loan was in '47 or '48.           It   became much greater.    As I remember we became delirious when the Bank hit $500&#13;
&#13;
was a small power loan to Chile.     The Bank also borrowed aoney froâ&#128;¢                     million a year in lending.    Today that would have been about 5 percent of what&#13;
&#13;
Switzerland.     It was from the Swiss government itself. Swiss francs were                the Bank lends.    I don't know what the Bank lends now.    What's happened since&#13;
&#13;
valuable at the time.     It wasn't a very big issue.                                      Conable came in? Between the Bank and IDA, they lend up to $15 billion a year,&#13;

           They really began lending for develop.ent in the early '50a.        They        which is a very sizeable chunk of money.    Of course it's in all kinds of&#13;

began to lend for power in Mexico and Brazil.     They were sizeable loans, at             currencies.&#13;
least for those days.     They got particularly involved in this enormous power            OLIVER:    And for a much wider variety of projects.&#13;
&#13;
reversing scheme in Brazil.     It was Brazilian Light and Traction Corporation,           BENNETT:    For a much wider variety of projects.&#13;
&#13;
where they dropped water over the Sierra.     They pumped it up in slack periods           OLIVER:    Including Sector Adjustment Loans and Structural Adjustment Loans.&#13;
&#13;
and they dropped it down as power demand peaked.        I suppose it is one of the         BENNETT:    Which I think would have been banned years ago -- the so called&#13;
&#13;
great power structures of the world.     They put a lot of aoney into Mexico for           impact loans they began to make.    That started in Italy back when the impact&#13;

words, you were really lending internal domestic capital, capital that could          everybody. All the top officials knew everybody down to the janitor, the&#13;
&#13;
be raised domestically but which was putting a big hole in their financial            elevator operators, and so on.    I suppose you would call it a cozy place to&#13;
&#13;
state.ents.    This money took its place.   That would have been frowned on in        work, exciting and interesting and also extremely pleasant.     Black announced&#13;
&#13;

OLIVER:     I think Professor Rosenatein-Rodan who retired shortly thereafter had     OLIVER:    Yas this reported in the Press at the time?&#13;

a major hand in the Italian loan.                                                     BENNETT:   Yes, it was reported in an article entitled, "Another Georgia Peach&#13;

Rosenstein Rodan would say, â&#128;¢tf you don't do it in a big way, don't do it at          OLIVER:    Are you pretty sure about that date, in August?&#13;

all.     You can't lend to an economy with a population the size of India in          BENNETT:    I would say it was August when I heard.   It is 26 years ago.&#13;

&#13;
Rodan won the war, but Bob Garner stayed on.      Rosenstein-Rodan was invited to     BENNETT:    In addition to First Boston (being the Managing Underwriter),&#13;

Eugene Black's Bank.     That was the way the people in the press felt of it, and     OLIVER:    This was in 1962?&#13;
&#13;
I guess it pretty much was.     It was a very small staff. Everybody knew             BENNETT:    No, this would have been back in the mid to late '50s, somewhere&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       11                                                                                        12&#13;

formed     the basis for the Bank's program of lending in India.                         OLIVER:    Well, I'm asking about the events in connections with Woods'&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Very interesting.                                                             appointment.&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:    The book store is down in this building.     You might even go in there      BENNETT:    Woods came down from New   Yor~   as a principal speaker several times.&#13;
&#13;
and ask if they have a copy of it.      If not you â&#128;¢lght go to the BankÂ·Fund             He was known in the Bank pretty well.         I had met him a number of years before&#13;
&#13;
library.    They aust have a copy there.      It might be well worth it, if not to       when The First Boston Corporation and Mellon Securities merged. I covered the&#13;
&#13;
read all of it, to read its conclusions.       Woods also assisted the Bank in           merger for the Herald Tribune.     This was back to â&#128;¢46 or '47, I've forgotten&#13;
&#13;
various others ways and several timea spoke to a eo-called information                   just when. That is the first time I ever met George Woods. He was talking&#13;
&#13;
conference. One of my jobs was to be chalraan of the lnforaatlon conferences             about chopping the wall down between the two companies Â·Â· on the same floor, the&#13;
&#13;
ln which a group of investment bankers and insurance executives, maybe 25 or             saae building.     They were going to chop a hole in the wall and that would make&#13;
&#13;
30 of them, would come down the night before, have dinner, and then the next             it all one.     I remember George pointing out the spot where the hole in the&#13;
&#13;
day go through a course on World Bankery, which started about 9 in the aorning           wall would be.&#13;
&#13;
and ended at S:OO in the afternoon.                                                      OLIVER:     Was it one hole?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I was reading about those.                                                    BENNETT:     No, I think it was a doorway. They were going to put a hole in the&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:    I don't know how . .ny of those things I chaired.     It .ust have been      wall â&#128;¢over there.â&#128;¢     He pointed to the wall. George was in fine fettle that&#13;
&#13;
dozens. I started doing it under McCloy, and I did it also under Black.          I did   day.   Anyway word got around; the rumors grew more and more precise about&#13;
&#13;
a few under Woods, but then I started to be out of the Bank .are than in lt,             Woods. He was ultimately nominated by John F. Kennedy in 1962.         He was accepted&#13;
&#13;
and various other people took over.                                                      by the Board and ultimately moved in on January l, 1963.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Old this happen two or three times a year?                                               The first rumble that I had there would be any difficulty came from&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:    Oh, lt happened two or three tl ..s a month, particularly in the             Barron's Weekly.     I don't know whether you know Barrons' Weekly or not.      Bob&#13;
&#13;
early days.    We educated everybody.   Later on we used the Eugene R. Black             Bleiberg was editor and still writes curmudgeon editorials for them.         His p81,&#13;
&#13;
Auditorium.    We filled the whole auditorium with lnvest.ent bankers.      (When I      Kurt Block, who was associate editor and a German economist, called me and&#13;
&#13;
say investment bankers, I mean financial people connected to institutional               asked me to have lunch with him and Bob, which I did.        He said, "Is it true&#13;
&#13;
investment, or investments by institutions of trust funds: banks, insurance              that Woods was going to be the new President?"        I said, "I can't sweat to it,&#13;
&#13;
companies investment bankers who make markets and so on.)       And the .. let's         but I don't think there is any doubt that he is going to be the new&#13;

president."     Bob Blelberg got tears in his eyes, he got so 4ngry.        He said,    money to have floating around in your pocket, but when you are making loans&#13;
&#13;
"That son of a blankety blank.     President of the World Bank, Barrons will            the way the Bank does (at what I suppose you call concessionary rates), you've&#13;
&#13;
never have another good word to say for the Bank.â&#128;¢     So I said,, â&#128;¢Why?"       "We     got to sit down with a very sharp pencil.    Should we make even a little profit&#13;
&#13;
just don't like him,â&#128;¢ he replied.                                                       on the money that we borrowed?     There Â¥aS a great fuss and doodle about that.&#13;
&#13;
           I gather what actually happened was that Woods threw some                    Ultimately it wound up that they agreed that there should be a spread, but&#13;
&#13;
representative of Barron's out of a press conference for asking a question              they didn't say which way the spread should go -- one eighth percent between&#13;
&#13;
Woods didn't like.     They never had a good word to say about the World Bank,          the cost of money to the Bank for, say, 1965, and the amount of interest that&#13;
&#13;
including the World Bank under McNaaara, but that's neither here nor there,             the Bank would earn on that.     The trouble was sometimes the eighth was&#13;
&#13;
That was the first noise I heard. Woods came in. I don't think anyone was               negative and sometimes it was positive. I thought the Bank was always losing&#13;
&#13;
delirious over the idea, but certainly nobody had any deep alaglvlnga about             money on its borrowed funds.&#13;
&#13;
him. I don't think anybody knew Woods that well.                                                Stone was the main thorn in Woods side on the Board.     The French&#13;
&#13;
           I would say that for his first year or so, he got along quite well           director frequently supported Stone;    occasionally somebody else would, but&#13;
&#13;
with the Board, with everybody.     Then he began to get testy about the IDA            moat of the directors were relatively neutral, I guess, and wished that it&#13;
&#13;
problem, which was always there like a vulture waiting for the victim to die.           would all go away.   This problem with the Board got worse as time went on as a&#13;
&#13;
That got on his nerves.     He had difficulties with some aeabers of the Board,         result of George's getting terribly soured by IDA's problems and continuing&#13;
&#13;
notably with a fellow naaed Stone, who was the Australian director, who was a           discussions of how the Bank's finances should be handled.    Ultimately it wound&#13;
&#13;
real smart apple and just as tough and just as rude as Woods. The two of them           up as a story by Ed Dale of the NY Times that the Board and George were at&#13;
&#13;
didn't like each other: two similarities disliking each other.       A number of        loggerheads.   I think Dale's story was overstated, but it was correct in the&#13;
&#13;
things came up at the Board: one was IDA, and the another was the Bank's                sense that there was a gap between George Woods and the general feeling of che&#13;
&#13;
profits.    What should be the source of profits to the Bank? Should they be            Board as to how the Bank should be run and what policy should be adapted&#13;
&#13;
only capital, or should it aake a profit on the money it borrowed as well.              effecting the financial standing of the Bank. George also battled with the&#13;
&#13;
           The Bank at that time probably had several billion   dol~ars   of capital.   administration and congress over getting money for IDA, which I think soured&#13;
&#13;
I don't know how much it's got now.     If you take the . .ount of general reserve      him more than anything else. I'm absolutely certain that the US Director&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank -- I don't have any idea what it is, but I imagine it would be up to        leaked that story to Ed Dale, because George was really flailing away at the&#13;
&#13;
$10 or $15 billion.    When I left, it was about $7 billion.    That's a lot of free    US and this is one way the US could get back to him.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       15                                                                                       16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Was Stone in office at the time of the Dale article?                         very quickly.&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     Oh yes, but Stone didn't do it.   1 should mention also the US              BENNETT:     He fired me once in Chicago for telling him that he reminded me of&#13;
&#13;
Director frequently was at odds with George, largely over the approach to IDA            the terrible tempered Hr. Bang.      About an hour later he called me up to say&#13;
&#13;
and to soae extent over how the US viewed the Bank as sort of a band of happy            he also read that old comic, the    Tooner~ille   Trolley, That Meets at all&#13;
&#13;
Sybarites living on the public purse.     This view was particularly strong in           Trains. Hr. Bang was one of the riders.     The trouble with George was that he&#13;
&#13;
the congressional staff.     The rumble always was that everybody in the Bank            did not know how to be a nice guy.     He could be when he wanted.    When he was&#13;
&#13;
lived on a tax-free salary which was not true.      Certainly I didn't, and no US        pleased with things and everything was going very well, he was very pleasant&#13;
&#13;
citizen working for the Bank did,      (You don't want to get into salary payaents       and easy going.     Frankly I got to like him quite a bit.    Only a few times did&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank.     You can get that better from somebody else.) Anyhow, I paid ay          he ever go after ae, but some people he was after consistently.&#13;
&#13;
taxes every year with tears in my eyes, as did Harold Graves and all the                            I think one of the saddest performances by George was when he booted&#13;
&#13;
others who were my US compatriot&amp; in the Bank.      I'a absolutely aura the atory        out Orvis Schmidt, who was the head of the Latin American      Departmen~.     Orvis&#13;
&#13;
was strategically set; it hit the I1mii front financial page on a Sunday, just           was one of the ablest people the Bank had.        He fired him not because of bad&#13;
&#13;
about a week or at moat two weeks before the Annual Meeting of the Bank in Rio           loans, but because he didn't make enough of them.       Orvis was a very able&#13;
&#13;
de Janeiro.     Of course it led, as you know, to Harold Graves having his head          character.     He looked like a hick, he talked like ~hick, but he was as smart&#13;
&#13;
chopped off by George Woods. It really sent Woods up the wall, there is no               as a whip.     He was also one of the few connections to Bretton Woods,        He was&#13;
&#13;
doubt about that.     He waa absolutely furious.                                         the secretary of the US delegation to Bretton Woods.        If you read the Bretton&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Who, George Woods?                                                           Woods papers, there is a note of thanks from the delegates to Hr. Orvis&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     George Woods.   He was absolutely furious when he caae back from Rio.       Schmidt for his labors.     George gave poor old Orvis the boot, not out of the&#13;
&#13;
It was shortly after that that he transferred Harold to another place in the             Bank but up to special advisor.     Orvis spent the last few years in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     He shouldn't have, because Harold was an excellent PR man.        He was       meandering around not doing very much.     Alas, he went to the first great Super&#13;
&#13;
probably the best speech writer the Bank ever had.      Also a very nice person          Bowl Game, almost froze to death, and died of pneumonia.        He came from&#13;
&#13;
himself. I was a great admirer of Harold.      George blaaed him because he should       Wisconsin and you'd think he would be hardened to the winter.        I've forgotten&#13;
&#13;
have stopped Dale.     Harold couldn't possibly have stopped that story.        It was   where that game was, but I think it was about 18 below zero when it happened.&#13;
&#13;
too good.                                                                                He was a hell of a nice guy. As I said, he looked like a hick and talked like&#13;

OLIVER:     I understand that even you were fired on occasion and brought back           one. He was an All American boy type, but he was absolutely brilliant.          He&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:     I take it there was no love lost between Henry Fowler and George        don't know if he wanted a full term. I think he felt that he had been through&#13;
Yoods.                                                                              the mill and he deserved some kind of recognition for it.         I'm sure it hurt&#13;
BENNETT:     I don't know what Fowler's feeling about George was, but I can         him very, very much not to be so recognized.&#13;
&#13;
assure you that George's feelings about Henry Fowler were unprintable. 1                       Everyone I know likes to psychoanalyse him, including me. I think I&#13;
listened to hiâ&#128;¢ several times on the subject.     Whose fault it was I don't        mentioned to you previously, he wanted to be admired, he wanted to be liked or&#13;
know, but he did not seem to be able to get IDA off the ground. IDA needed          loved or whatever it was.     He wanted people to feel about him the way they&#13;
&#13;
money.     I think you better check this, but my feeling is that he never got       felt about Gene Black.     There are some people who have it and there are some&#13;
&#13;
any.     The first money that IDA got was after McNamara came in in 1968.           people who don't.     He didn't have whatever it is that Black had Â·- the ability&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It had been programmed in advance.                                      to be pleasant to people whom you dislike and with whom you disagree.           That&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     It had been programmed, but the money did not come in.   The auount    was always an impossibility with George -- to talk civilly to somebody who was&#13;
&#13;
programmed was substantially less than had been asked for and was spread over       disagreeing strongly with him.&#13;
&#13;
a longer period.     Congress had the feeling we were all a bunch of Sybarites                 I remember Bob Cavanaugh. They banged away at each other at a number&#13;
&#13;
having a wonderful time on public funds, not really working very hard, and          of meetings where they were discussing bond issues. I remember the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
eating free in the executive dining room and all that, which was all wrong,         lawyers from Sullivan and Cromwell walking out of the room after listening to&#13;
&#13;
but nevertheless . . . .     There were a number of people on the Congressional     George telling them what they could not say in a bond prospectus.           Of course&#13;
&#13;
staff who disliked the Bank very much and staff can do you in.                      the lawyers won in the end anyway, but George certainly let them know what his&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Have you any concrete illustrations of the fact that Yoods probably     feelings were about the views of Sullivan and        Cromwell.&#13;
&#13;
wanted to be President again?                                                       OLIVER:    There is a hint of a sort of a falling out between Black and Woods.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      19                                                                                       20&#13;

&#13;
Would you comment?                                                                     investor. The Bank up to 1963 (this is recollection) had sold one German mark&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:    If there was, I don't know of it.     I came to N.Y.C. with George from    issue and was fiddling around with a yen issue in Japan, which had not been&#13;
&#13;
someplace, God knows where, I would say lata in his regime.      Gene Black had        sold yet,     We had been diddling in the French market for years without any&#13;
&#13;
shingles at the time and was in the hospital.      George was very upset when he       success.     Later on, after I left the   ~ank,   they did finally sell a franc&#13;
&#13;
heard about it.    As soon as he got off the plane, he had a ll.ouslne meet us.        issue.     They sold a few issues in the Netherlands, all rather small, and I&#13;
&#13;
We whipped over to whatever hospital it was in Manhattan.       George got out and     think a couple of issues in Belgium,      The Swiss and US markets, by far the US&#13;
&#13;
went in to see Black. I was taken on to the hotel with George's baggage. We            market, were the dominant sources of funds in the Bank at that time. This was&#13;
&#13;
were going to this Due Diligence meeting the next day.       I settled into the        one of the main reasons why Kennedy wanted to have a man who was known widely&#13;
&#13;
hotel with the luggage, and George spent the evening with Black at the                 as a very able American investment banker and financier and a very successful&#13;
&#13;
hospital.     I think they had dinner together.    If they had a falling out, I        one.&#13;
&#13;
don't know about it.                                                                           Another virtue that he had was he knew the Bank.     He was the Chairman of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     This was what year?                                                        the First Boston Corporation, which had, since 1951 or 52, been one of the two&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT: I would say it was probably 1966.                                             lead underwriters of the Bank's managing underwriters, the other one being&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     This was after Black retired?                                              Morgan Stanley.     He was known in the Bank, he knew the Bank, he knew the&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     This waa after Black retired and got the shingles, George heard           Bank's finances, he knew the Bank's market.        Woods seemed, at least at the&#13;
&#13;
about it on the trip we were on -- that Black had the shingles, and when we            tiae, to be the ideal man to bring in.&#13;
&#13;
got back to New York the first thing he did was go to see Black,       I would say             I think something that is forgotten in all this is that there was another&#13;
&#13;
that was about 1966, or 1967, probably 1967.      At least on George's side, there     reason to put a US banker in,     and that was the Gentlemens Agreement that was&#13;
&#13;
was no animosity that I know of.      What Black felt, I have no idea.     I was not   made at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 that the Managing Director of the&#13;
&#13;
that close to Black.                                                                   Monetary Fund would be a European and the President of the World Bank would be&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Do you think it was important co have somebody of Woods' calibre and       an American,     All these things are not written in stone, but chat is how its&#13;
&#13;
background to lead the World Bank in 1963?                                             been.     It's been all Americans for the Bank and all Europeans for the Monetary&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     I would say, â&#128;¢ves.â&#128;¢   At that time, and possibly still, the US market     Fund,     I expect one of these days, a Japanese, or maybe a German, will be&#13;
&#13;
(particularly the market in New York which is the center of the US market) was         president of the Fund.     It hasn't happened yet, and I don't see any evidence of&#13;
&#13;
by far the greatest capital reservoir available to the Bank or to any other            it happening at the present time.     It is more likely to happen at the Bank&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     21                                                                                   22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
than the Fund.    The Japanese, I am sure, would just love to have this job, and    OLIVER:    Is there a story in that?&#13;
&#13;
possibly they deserve it.    They certainly lent the Bank a hell of a lot of        BENNETT:   Well, I don't know McNamara well.      When McNamara came in, there was&#13;
&#13;
money in the last lS years or so -- bllliona upon billions of yen; they get         a tremendous uproar in the Bank.       A lot of the staff were running around&#13;
&#13;
richer every day.                                                                   yelling, NI'll resign, and all that."      !hey didn't, but there was a great deal&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It has been suggested by Stem Aldewereld that there is still another    of feeling that he was the architect of Viet Nam, which he wasn't.         The&#13;
&#13;
reason for the appointment of George Woods to wit he was on the buying side of      architect of VietNam I guess was -- well maybe he was the architect.             It&#13;
&#13;
First Boston rather than on the selling aide.     Presumably this gave a longer     started under Eisenhower, but it got worse under Kennedy, and much worse after&#13;
&#13;
term prospective on the management of the Bank.                                     that under Johnson and Nixon.     McNamara is supposed to have given his apologia&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:    At First Boston, Woods, as Chairperson, made the final decision as to   in a speech in Montreal in which he spoke on development.       I'm sure that has&#13;
&#13;
which securities the firm would underwrite, i.e. co. . tt itself to buy. Jim        been mentioned to you many times.&#13;
&#13;
Coggeshall, who was president, was on the selling or marketing side. Eail           OLIVER:    Which brought Woods' attention to him.&#13;
&#13;
Patberg was George's successor at First Boston,     He was equally saart, but he    BENNETT:    That's right. The Board finally accepted him. There was a lot of&#13;
&#13;
would have made a nicer president of the World Bank than George Woods. He is        noise on the board, at least there were several directors that I met at&#13;
&#13;
now dead, but he was a very pleasant person, kindly, and surely good to his         various places who sort of muttered under their breath that this was a bad&#13;
&#13;
mother and small children,     Maybe George was too, but you didn't think he        choice, but for some reason or other they went along and voted yes, I guess,&#13;
&#13;
would be.                                                                           in the interest of peace.      I know in 1970, my wife and I were invited to&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Are there any things that I should have asked and haven't?              dinner by a group of Dutch bankers whom I knew very well.       They had this&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     What you have here in the papers, and what I aaid today would cover    marvelous dinner down on the waterfront in Copenhagen, and, during the dinner,&#13;
&#13;
pretty much.     I think I have given the impression that George Woods basically    it came up:    Why McNamara?   This was two years after the event, but they said&#13;
&#13;
had a heart of gold, but it didn't show.     As I said, I liked hiâ&#128;¢, I got along    he was not the man for the job, etc., etc.       They still underwrote our bonds.&#13;
&#13;
pretty well with hia, and he liked me.     When he left the Bank, he gave me a      I guess they are still doing it, but they were very much opposed to his reign&#13;
&#13;
big boost to McN. .ara.    It was largely as a result of that that McNamara         and hoped that he would not be reelected.&#13;
&#13;
picked me to be a representative in New York and around the financial world.             It was all based on ideology rather than on any business or financial&#13;
&#13;
I spent the last ten years of my life at the Bank    ~andering   around all over    interest that they had.     They disagreed with his background as Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
God's green acre.                                                                   Defense, the Viet Nam War, and all that stuff.       Of course you know in Denmark&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      23                                                                                           24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
we had magnificent displays of anger by the far left, a bunch of very tough            the directors said, "Yes," and he became President with a hiatus allowed to&#13;
&#13;
Swedes who came over, about 2 or 3 thousand of them.      One night at the opera       George Woods so that McNamara could finish up various tasks and take a&#13;
&#13;
they were throwing shoes with nails driven through thea into the crowd.         They   vacation before he came in on April 1, 1968.&#13;
&#13;
burned a bunch of pollceaan'a aotorcyclas.     The last day at the aeeting, there              I must say that the Bank was   neve~    the same thereafter.     Whether that was&#13;
&#13;
was a big party in City Hall ln Copenhagen.       There must have been 10,000          good or bad I don't know.       George Woods was a great hirer of economists.           I&#13;
&#13;
people outside with a big sign:    International Bank for Deatryctton.     I forgot    guess he expanded the economist's population in the Bank at least twice or&#13;
&#13;
what else they used,    They didn't throw anything else that day.     I know ay        maybe threefold.     McNamara expanded everything.      Whether it was all needed or&#13;
&#13;
wife and I were out ln a cab one night.     They didn't bother us, but they            not I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
bothered some other people from the Bank.     Why?    I hadn't any idea, but they              An interesting fellow was George Mooney, now deceased. He was the Bank&#13;
&#13;
chased their cab in a car.                                                             editor at    the~         and I was the Bank editor of the Tribune.       He stayed on&#13;
&#13;
     That's neither here nor there.    It has nothing to do with Woods, but his        for several years after I left the Tribune, and then became Superintendent of&#13;
&#13;
choice was not greeted with cries of joy and gladness within the Bank, and             Banks of the State of New York under Averill Harriman.          Later he became the&#13;
&#13;
especially outside the Bank.    A lot of people still don't understand why it          head of a very sizeable savings bank.          He knew the World Bank.     He used to&#13;
&#13;
ever happened.   There were other people who could have taken on this job.        It   come down a great deal to visit Elinor, my late wife, and me.             He was in the&#13;
&#13;
would have been interesting.    It' a like all the other ifa in history,   How         World Bank from time to time.       He knew Black and a number of other people&#13;
&#13;
wo~ld the Bank look today if there had been somebody else in McNaaara's place?         well.     When he heard about George Woods and his economists, he thought it was&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was a study in psychology, too, even more subtle than George Woods'           very silly.     The Bank, considering its political situation, didn't really need&#13;
psychology.                                                                            all this.     What was needed was a few really bright people with their heads&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Do you think that McNamara was Woods first choice?                             screwed on tight to do the lending and to keep an eye on things, but you&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:   I heard about the suggestion of McNamara for president of the Bank          didn't need 18 economists to decide a point, which seemed to be what George&#13;
&#13;
in early October, 1967, from Morton Mendels, who was then Secretary of the             Woods was doing.&#13;
&#13;
Bank, now deceased.    He was absolutely livid.    He was a Canadian, and he           OLIVER:     Let alone 300.&#13;
&#13;
couldn't believe that this was happening.     He more or less predicted that the       BENNETT:     300 or so.    George Mooney felt that the Bank's greatest safety was&#13;
&#13;
directors would turn him down, which of course they didn't.      Sure enough           the fact that it was owned by its membership, owned by the people it lent to.&#13;
&#13;
Lyndon Johnson did nominate him, I think in early December of 1967, and bango          It was a world-wide organization, very well known, and to default to it was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        25                                                                                   26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
financial suicide.     I think he probably had a point.                                 that way, but the only source of funds that this organization could afford was&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, IDA turned things around very substantially.      If it had            practically free money.     I get awfully tired of telling people that.&#13;
&#13;
remained the IBRD, rather than adding IDA, there la no question that Woods              OLIVER:     Besides which I'm convinced that the Bank has not behaved that way.&#13;
&#13;
would have done what you say.     But once IDA was introduced there were no clear       It has become very fuzzy at the margin.&#13;
&#13;
cut grounds on which to decide amongst countries.       Virtually free money makes      BENNETT:     IDA would have been better off by itself.   Many people say its&#13;
&#13;
the Bank a development bank rather than a co.aerclal bank on concessionary              closeness to the Bank is a great advantage, expedites international lending,&#13;
&#13;
terms.     That, I think, is what motivated Woods to press for . .                      and so on.     I. think it would have made life a hell of a lot easier for the&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     You may well be right.     I know one of the things that used to           president of the World Bank, the directors of the World Bank, and the staff of&#13;
&#13;
irritate the life out of ae and made my life much harder -- the Bank's alleged          the World Bank if IDA had been down the block somewhere totally unrelated to&#13;
&#13;
financial relations advisor. . . .        I moved out of the writing.   I still did a   the Bank.     It would have made IDA stand on its own two feet.&#13;
&#13;
great deal of writing, but as financial relationa adviaor, I uaed to zip                OLIVER:     I agree.&#13;
&#13;
around and talk to Banks.     I knew every bank for miles around, both abroad and&#13;
&#13;
here.     One of the things that used to drive me up the vall was people treating&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank and IDA as one.        When it first started, IDA had put out a&#13;
&#13;
separate Annual Report and used a separate letterhead.        Then all of a sudden&#13;
&#13;
KcNaaara caae in and said, "Drop all this.        Let' a aake it all one lovely big&#13;
&#13;
ball of money."&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I think it vas a big mistake.&#13;
&#13;
BENNETT:     I think it was a great mistake.     I aust have made at least 89&#13;
&#13;
speeches a year Â·- not real speeches, but with people coming up and saying,&#13;
&#13;
"How the hell can you lend to XYZ when they don't have two pennies to rub&#13;
&#13;
together?"     Of course it would be IDA that aade the loan.     We made a song and&#13;
&#13;
dance about how the monies were totally separate.        The staff was the same, but&#13;
&#13;
things were looked at froa a different angle than from the Bank.        The Bank&#13;
&#13;
angle was a viable etc., etc., etc.       The IDA angle was that it would still be&#13;

            In January 1988, William L. Bennett was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1949 to 1978, Mr. Bennett worked in the
            information and public affairs department as a financial
            editor. His transcript concerns his tenure at the Bank. He
            discusses Eugene Meyer as first president of the World Bank,
            his disagreement over the board of executive to run the
            day-to-day operations. Mr. Bennett elaborates on the bond
            ratings, the efforts made by John J. McCloy and his team to
            raise the visibility of the World Bank, and to establish its
            credibility as a lender. Finally, Bennett discusses George
            Woods recommending him to Robert McNamara resulting in his
            appointment as the representative to the World Bank in New
            York as financial relations advisor, and opines on the pros
            and cons of the International Development Association (IDA)
            setup within the World Bank.
