April 1980&#13;
FERTILITY AND ITS REGULATION IN BANGLADESH&#13;
Data from two comparable national surveys--taken in 1968-69 and&#13;
L975-76 --are used to study fertility trends, levels, regulations, and their&#13;
determining factors. Annual marital fertility rates declined substantially&#13;
'between the two surveys, but the total number of children ever born to&#13;
each married woman did not decline. This is explained in part by the nature&#13;
of these fertility measures.' The decline in the annual (current) fertility&#13;
rates, if sustained, lowers the cumulative rate only after a time lag.&#13;
In bangladesh, the observed dip in the annual fertility rates in 1974-75&#13;
represents a recent phenomenon; it perhaps reflects to some degree the effect&#13;
on fecundity of the 1974-75 famine in Bangladesh. To the extent this is&#13;
true, the annual fertility rates will revert to the previous roughly constant&#13;
trend. If, however, this recent dip in annual fertility rates is a part of a&#13;
sustained trend of decline, the number of children ever born to each married&#13;
woman will decrease in the future.&#13;
The analysis shows no evidence of significant differences in fertility&#13;
among Bangladesh women who differ in such socioeconomic characteristics as educa-&#13;
tion, exposure to urban influences and occupation. Biological or involuntary&#13;
factors underlie most of the existing individual differences. These factors&#13;
explain why bangladesh women -- although attaining the natural fertility rather&#13;
than a controlled level --   have a much lower level of fertility than what could&#13;
be considered biologically maximum. Also, the finding that physical factors&#13;
are significant supports the hypothesis thaLt the 1974-75 dip in annual fertility&#13;
reflects, to a large extent, the effect of famine conditions.&#13;
between the two surveys, there have been significant, favorable&#13;
changes in attitudes toward and knowledge about contraception across all&#13;
socioeconomic groups. Nonetheless, contraceptive practice increased only&#13;
slightly, reflecting, perhaps, the existence of a lag between favorable&#13;
disposition to family planning and its adoption. However, unlike fertility,&#13;
contraceptive variables are significantly related to socioeconomic development&#13;
variables such as education, indicating that with socioeconomic development&#13;
more substantial gains can be expected in contraceptive knowledge, attitudes,&#13;
and practices in Bangladesh.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
Bangladesh, where the vast majority of people live in dire poverty,&#13;
is seriously overpopulated. Fertility levels and trends, fertility regulation,&#13;
and the factors determining fertility have great policy significance for&#13;
Bangladesh, yet little is known about them. Two comparable national surveys,&#13;
the World Fertility Survey (WFS) for Bangladesh, held in 1975-76, and the&#13;
Impact of Family Planning Survey, held in 1968-69, can be analyzed. This&#13;
paper analyzes the two data sets, essentially addressing the following two&#13;
questions:&#13;
(1) How do the various socioeconomic groups of Bangladesh women compare&#13;
on the measures of fertility and of contraceptive knowledge, attitudes,&#13;
and practices (KAP)--estimated from the two surveys?&#13;
(2) What factors explain group and individual differences in fertility&#13;
and KAP measures at the times of the two surveys?&#13;
Several interesting findings emerged from the analysis.&#13;
First, the data clearly indicates that the annual marital fertility&#13;
rates declined substantially between the two surveys. If the entire period&#13;
spanned by the two surveys is considered, the decline is approximately 32&#13;
percent between 1960-62 and 1974-75. Higher declines were observed in&#13;
the lowest income occupational groups examined--the nonowner cultivators&#13;
and nonagricultural laborers--and among the most educated and the highest&#13;
income occupational group--the officials. No major changes among the middle&#13;
strata--the owner cultivator and the business classes--were discernible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Second, unlike the trend in the cross-sectional marital fertility&#13;
rates, cumulative fertility for each married woman shows no decline as mea-&#13;
sured by the total number of children ever born--at the times of the national&#13;
surveys. No significant differences in cumulative fertility between rural and&#13;
urban areas or across occupational groups are observed. Both in 1969 and&#13;
1976, the average number of children ever born per married woman is about 4&#13;
for all ages combined. When disaggregated by urban and rural areas, and by&#13;
various occupational groups, this figure still remains around 4 in all groups.&#13;
This is consistent with the hypothesis that the level of cumulative fertility&#13;
among Bangladesh women still conforms to their natural fertility levels.&#13;
Choice or regulation does not seem to play a significant role in the determi-&#13;
nants of family size; the family size norm is uniformly high across all&#13;
socioeconomic strata.&#13;
Third, the observed discrepancy between the trends in the annual&#13;
and cumulative fertility for each married woman is partially explained by the&#13;
way these measures are constructed. If there is a decline in the current&#13;
fertility rate, its reducing effect on the cumulative fertility rate will be&#13;
felt only after a time lag. If the 1974-75 dip in the annual fertility rates&#13;
(compared with those of 1968-69) is only a recent phenomenon, the cumulative&#13;
fertility rate--measured by children ever born--will not capture the decline.&#13;
The dip in the annual fertility rates in 1974-75 possibly reflects the effect&#13;
of the 1974-75 famine on fecundity in Bangladesh. If true, this dip would&#13;
probably be temporary and annual fertility would revert to its previous&#13;
roughly constant trend. If the fertility reduction is part of a sustained&#13;
declining trend, the cumulative fertility measure will show future decreases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
Fourth, the multivariate analysis of individual fertility supports&#13;
the aggregate analysis. Only small differences in fertility exist among&#13;
individuals who differ in such socioeconomic characteristics as education,&#13;
exposure to urban influences, and occupation.    This is consistent with the&#13;
finding that a uniform trend of cumulative fertility appears across socio-&#13;
economic groups. Most Bangladesh women attain natural rather than controlled&#13;
fertility, regardless of their socioeconomic status. However, the facts that&#13;
there are some small differences in fertility among the socioeconomic groups&#13;
and, more importantly, that the overall fertility is significantly lower than&#13;
what can be considered biologically possible, indicate the effect of biologi-&#13;
cal or involuntary factors. The total number of children of married women at&#13;
the end of their reproductive age is, on average, between six and seven in&#13;
Bangladesh, compared with nine to eleven among the Hutterites of North America.&#13;
The significant role of biological or involuntary factors is also consistent&#13;
with the hypothesis that the 1974-75 dip in annual fertility may reflect, to&#13;
a large extent, the effect of famine.&#13;
Fifth, between the two surveys, significant, favorable changes have&#13;
occurred in attitudes toward and knowledge about contraception across all&#13;
socioeconomic groups. This is probably the effect of the intensive campaign&#13;
of the official family planning program, which has been operating since 1962.&#13;
Compared to the level in contraceptive knowledge and attitudes, the increase&#13;
in the contraceptive practice rate is low. Even use of contraceptives re&#13;
mained well below 20 percent of all eligible women in most socioeconomic&#13;
groups, whereas the knowledge about modern contraceptives reached a level of&#13;
over 60 percent among some groups. Intention to use contraceptives in the&#13;
future also passed 30 percent among women of some socioeconomic groups. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
gap perhaps reflects a lag between favorable disposition to family planning&#13;
and its adoption. Unlike fertility, contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and&#13;
practices are significantly related to socioeconomic variables such as educa-&#13;
tion, indicating that development probably will have a strong positive effect&#13;
on these variables.&#13;
Sixth, this paper identifies a few priority areas for further research.&#13;
Among the questions that might be asked are the following: (1) Is the&#13;
1974-75 decline in the annual fertility rate found in WFS substantiated by&#13;
more recent fertility data? (2) What time lags are involved between favorable&#13;
disposition to family planning and effectively practicing it and between&#13;
effective practice and fertility decline? Are these lags influenced by&#13;
socioeconomic variables and family planning program activities? If so,&#13;
how?&#13;
&#13;

FERTILITY AND ITS REGULATION IN BANGLADESH 1/&#13;
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries of the world, has also&#13;
one of the highest rural Population densities. Approximately 90 percent of&#13;
the people work in agriculture and about 80 percent of the total cultivable&#13;
land provides food production. Yet, the country imports a substantive amount&#13;
of food and the balance between population and resources in the Bangladesh&#13;
economy is precarious. The situation is further compounded by a 2.8 percent&#13;
annual growth in population; in 1976, a crude birth rate was estimated at 47&#13;
and a crude death rate, at 18. Reduction of population growth rate has,&#13;
therefore, been the major goal for national planners since the early sixties,&#13;
and international agencies including the World Bank have strongly supported&#13;
this goal. (Among the countries where the Bank has a population project,&#13;
Bangladesh has received the largest International Development Association&#13;
credit for the population sector.) An official family planning program has&#13;
been in operation since 1962. In spite of the seriousness of the population&#13;
issue and the existence of an official family planning program for nearly&#13;
two decades, recent levels of and trends in fertility and contraceptive&#13;
practice among Bangladesh women are not known.&#13;
Although several studies have examined fertility levels, trends, and&#13;
differentials in fertility as well as in contraceptive knowledge, attitude, and&#13;
practice in Bangladesh, the emerging picture is unclear. Some of these&#13;
studies revealed the persistence of high fertility patterns consistent with&#13;
the noncontracepting nature of the population (Afzal, 1967; Schultz, 1970;&#13;
Blacker, 1977; Cains and DeVries-Baastiens, 1976; Chowdhury et al., 1970;&#13;
Sirageldin et al., 1975 ). Other research detected of knowledge about and&#13;

K. Hill, A. Hill, J. Pratt and L. Martin for their valuable comments on&#13;
an earlier draft.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
favorable attitude (verbally expressed) towards birth control and/or small&#13;
family size (Duza, 1967; Sirageldin et al., 1975 ; Stoeckel and Chowdhury,&#13;
1969 ;   Green et al., 1972; Ahmed, 1972; Waliullah, 1974).&#13;
Some of the findings of the studies are-contradictory. For example,&#13;
in his examination of retrospective pregnancy histories from central Bangla-&#13;
desh, Schultz (1970) found that total marital fertility declined in 1950s.&#13;
However, in analyzing the pregnancy history data of a national probability&#13;
sample, Sirageldin et al. (1975) found total marital fertility of the early&#13;
1960s higher than the 1950 data that Schultz examined. Again, the estimates&#13;
of Sirageldin et al. of marital fertility in the 1960s were lower than the&#13;
estimates by Chowdhury et al. (1970) for 1967-69, based on a vital registra-&#13;
tion system of a localized area of Bangladesh. These studies, therefore,&#13;
underscore the need to examine the trends of Bangladesh fertility systematical-&#13;
ly, to determine whether recent fertility actually declined or whether these&#13;
fertility rates merely reflected random fluctuations or periodic oscillations&#13;
around a long-run trend.&#13;
Since little research has focused on the determinants of fertility&#13;
and contraceptive behavior, knowledge of these subjects is at best sketchy.&#13;
In a survey article, Arthur and McNicoll (1978) attempt to provide an overview&#13;
of population and development relationships and issues in Bangladesh, includ-&#13;
ing a profile of inter-relatedness of fertility and household economic beha-&#13;
vior. However, the article basically lists hypotheses, rather than providing&#13;
empirical evidence. The authors seem to conclude that the motivating factors&#13;
for high fertility in rural Bangladesh lie in the uncertainty and insecurity&#13;
of rural life in Bangladesh, due in part to the dependence on nature and its&#13;
variation and also to the prevailing economic relationships in the villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Their thesis is that, given this uncertainty and insecurity and the incentive&#13;
structure, different socioeconomic groups consciously seek and attain diffe-&#13;
rent family sizes.&#13;
Sirageldin states a few themes in several short papers on Bangla-&#13;
desh, some of which are based on a 1968-69 national survey on the impact of&#13;
family planning. First, he argues that the evidence of some decline in some&#13;
socioeconomic groups in Bangladesh can only be explained by changes in environ-&#13;
mental and biological factors. Second, based on recent preliminary data, he&#13;
concluded that the share-cropping system in Bangladesh is an important econo-&#13;
mic motive for some families to have several children. Those families with&#13;
many working-age male children have grounds to claim land for share cropping.&#13;
Their claims succeed because the landlords feel more secure that their expecta-&#13;
tions froum the sharecroppers will be fulfilled if a family has many working&#13;
children.&#13;
Amon% the earlier studies, Schultz (1970) traced the fertility&#13;
trend between 195) and 196U and attributed the broad increase in fertility&#13;
among 15 to 19 year olds to the improvement in health conditions. Cain&#13;
(1977) studied the economic utility of children in rural Bangladesh and&#13;
argues that children represent a reduced economic benefit because they can no&#13;
longer be easily engaged in production or be employed because of increasing&#13;
economic deterioration in Bangladesh.   Chen et al. (1974) found a positive&#13;
relationship between birth interval and lactation period and Chowdhury et al.&#13;
(1976) round a positive relationship between child-death experience and&#13;
subsequent fertility in a few selected villages of Bangladesh. Chaudhury&#13;
(1974) also found negative effects of education and labor force participation&#13;
on total number ot children born. M4any of these studies, however, are based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
on small local surveys that have limited relevance to the whole country.&#13;
Moreover, few of these studies used the multivariate framework; as a result,&#13;
the effect of a particular factor is not always derived by controlling other&#13;
factors.   These studies, thus, did not clearly show the relative roles of&#13;
various factors that might explain the differential trends in fertility among&#13;
various socioeconomic groups in Bangladesh. It is also not clear whether&#13;
family planning knowledge, attitudes, and practices vary along socioeconomic&#13;
strata or whether they have changed over time.&#13;
Given this background, the present study essentially addresses two&#13;
questions: (1) How does the recent fertility as well as current knowledge and&#13;
attitudes about, and practice of contraception (KAP) among various socioecono-&#13;
mic groups compare with the earlier measures of the same variables? (2) What&#13;
factors explain individual differences in fertility and KAP measures at two&#13;
different times?&#13;
The availability of two national probability sample surveys,&#13;
namely, the Impact of Family Planning Survey, taken in 1968-69 but hereafter&#13;
referred by the completion year (1969), and the 1976 World Fertility Survey&#13;
(WFS) for Bangladesh, taken in 1975-76 but hereafter referred by the completion&#13;
year (1976),1/ provide an opportunity to investigate these questions.&#13;
Although they reflect a difference of only seven years, the data sets can&#13;
help in analyzing the trend and socioeconomic correlates of fertility and&#13;
contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and practices at different times.&#13;
Data Sources and Methods&#13;
The National Impact Survey, a nationally representative retrospec-&#13;
tive survey, contains detailed questions on pregnancy histories, socioeconomic&#13;
background, marriage history, family planning knowledge, attitude, and prac-&#13;
tice of the respondents. The sampling frame consisted of all households in&#13;
Bangladesh. A national probability sample of "ever married" women between the&#13;
ages of 10 and 50 were selected and stratified by urban and rural residence.&#13;
1/ Besides the data for the period in which the surveys were held, the two surveys&#13;
also provide data for other years on the basis of retrospective answers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
More detailed information on the Impact Survey is available elsewhere&#13;
(Pakistan 1974).&#13;
The World Fertility Survey for Bangladesh (1976) was also a national&#13;
probability sample of ever married women between the ages 10 and 50. Like&#13;
the Impact Survey, it also collected information on pregnancy histories,&#13;
socioeconomic backgrounds, marriage histories, contraceptive knowledge,&#13;
attitudes, and practices of the respondents. In addition, it collected&#13;
information on biological factors affecting fertility, such as lactation,&#13;
postpartum amenorrhea, and age at supplemental feeding. A three-stage sample&#13;
design was adopted; the first two stages were area selections and the ulti-&#13;
mate stage was household selection. Once the ultimate sampling unit, the&#13;
household, was selected, all ever married women between the ages 10 and 50 in&#13;
each selected household were interviewed.     More detailed information about&#13;
this survey is also available elsewhere (Bangladesh, 1978). In this study,&#13;
we have utilized only the data on "currently married" women, who numbered&#13;
3,088 for the Impact Survey and 5,772 World Fertility Survey.&#13;
This study focuses on the socioeconomic differentials in fertility&#13;
and in knowledge, attitudes and practices of contraception, as revealed in the&#13;
two data sets. Also, changes between the two surveys among different socio-&#13;
economic groups are investigated.&#13;

is nearly universal in Bangladesh, we are capturing most of the fertility&#13;
levels by considering marital rates. However, we are ignoring the effects&#13;
of change of age at marriage and marriage incidence in our analysis. In&#13;
any case, we do not expect these effects to be substantial in Bangladesh.&#13;

a period of 15 years (1960 to 1975). Despite possible differences in the&#13;
conduct of the two surveys, clearly declining trends in fertility emerge&#13;
within each survey. Total marital fertility rate declined 32 percent between&#13;
the early sixties and the mid-seventies.    Fertility in each age-group, too,&#13;
seems to have declined consistently over time, although this decline can be&#13;
claimed mostly within rather than between surveys. Differential declines by&#13;
occupation in total and age-specific marital fertility rates are shown in&#13;
table 2. In all occupational groups, total marital fertility declined from&#13;
1966-68 to 1974-75. The higher declines were observed in the two lower income&#13;
groups, nonowner cultivator--24 percent--and nonagricultural labor--14&#13;
percent. Officials, who represent the educated and the higher income class of&#13;
the population also experienced a substantial decline of marital fertility --&#13;
17 percent. Decline in total marital fertility from 1968-70 to 1974-75 shown&#13;
by WFS data in table 3 also presents the same picture. The general pattern,&#13;
therefore, appears to be that the lower economic strata experienced the&#13;
greatest declines in fertility followed closely by the educated class. No&#13;
major differences between rural and urban couples are discernable from either&#13;
data set (table 4).&#13;
A comparison of cumulative fertility per married woman--measured&#13;
by the total number of children born during the two national surveys--&#13;
indicates a somewhat different picture of the trend. The cumulative number&#13;
of children, which averaged around 4 per woman in both periods, did not show&#13;
any drop in fertility. Table 5 shows that, unlike cross-sectional marital&#13;
fertility rates, cumulative marital fertility does not show any significant&#13;
declining trend over time when averaged for all ages.      However, the average&#13;
number of children ever born in the 30-49 age group was higher in the most&#13;
recent survey than in the earlier one. The widening of differences with&#13;

increasing age indicates a probable reduction in memory error in the reporting&#13;
of live births between the two surveys. This is plausible because the later&#13;
survey (WFS) has a few more probing questions than the earlier one. It is&#13;
also possible.that.. the quality of the interview, especially about past&#13;
events, was better in the later survey.&#13;
When cumulative fertility within socioeconomic groups is examined,&#13;
the greatest rise in cumulative fertility is observed in the agricultural&#13;
sector (table 6). As in the cross-sectional marital fertility rates, no&#13;
rural-urban differences in cumulative fertility are observed within each&#13;
survey (table 7). But a comparison of the two surveys shows that the rural&#13;
residents have increased cumulative fertility in the more recent period (1976)&#13;
compared with the earlier one (1969). Again this may be a reflection of the&#13;
improvement in the recall of live births from the first survey to the second.&#13;
Several explanations can be offered for the pattern of fertility&#13;
trends in Bangladesh. The unusually depressed cross-sectional marital&#13;
fertility rates of the more recent period, 1974-75, perhaps reflect the&#13;
physical effect of the recent famine conditions on the fecundity of lower&#13;
socioeconmic women, such as nonagricultural laborers and nonowner-cultivators.&#13;
To the extent that these women were most affected by the famine conditions,&#13;
their relatively lower fertility is consistent with the hypothesis that&#13;
inadequate living conditions reduce fertility (Frisch, 1978). Among several&#13;
possible ways that famine conditions might have temporarily reduced fertility&#13;
levels obviously include famine related malnutrition. Other factors could be&#13;
loss of libido among men, anemia in the women, absence of the husband from&#13;
home to search for work, or voluntary efforts to limit fertility because of&#13;
the crisis.  These%factors are more likely to affect the lower socioeconomic&#13;

strata than the higher ones. This temporary depressing effect on current&#13;
fertility of the recent famine conditions has also been reported in an earlier,&#13;
local study (Chowdhury and Curlin, 1977) as well as in the WFS data set&#13;
(Bangladesh, 1978) for the entire nation. The recent overall lower fertility&#13;
levels compared with earlier ones, might have resulted, among other factors,&#13;
from reduced infant and child mortality. This would lead to prolongated&#13;
lactation that results in extended amenorrhea, lengthening the intervals&#13;
between births. The downward trend of infant mortality has been reported in&#13;
several studies (Stoeckel and Chowdhury 1973, Schultz, 1970, Sirageldin et.&#13;
al. 1975 b).&#13;
Part of the reason of the observed difference in trends of annual&#13;
fertility rates and of the cumulative number of children could be that&#13;
coverage of live births improved from the 1968-69 survey to the 1975-76&#13;
survey as a result of better probing and a more complete recording of past&#13;
live births in the later survey. Alternatively, there might have been less&#13;
prenatal loss in recent years and, therefore, more live births compared with&#13;
the earlier period. The recent progress in malaria control might have&#13;
removed a particular hazard to the health of child-bearing women and might&#13;
have contributed to an increase in full-term delivery by pregnant women.&#13;
Given the nature of the fertility index, the cumulative number of&#13;
live births does not reflect the extent of the current fertility change that&#13;
occurred between 1966-68 and 1974-75. The degree of change that the index&#13;
shows is lessened by including births that occurred before the year for which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
the fertility is measured. The effect of dilution obviously would be much&#13;
less if the fertility had gradually declined for a long time. For example, if&#13;
the fertility has been declining gradually between 1966-68 and 1974-75, the&#13;
cumulative index at 1974-75 would show more decline than if fertility had&#13;
suddenly dropped around 1974-75. In our data the dilution caused by past&#13;
births was so significant that, with improvement in the recall of births,&#13;
it showed no drop in fertility. The results, therefore, are persuasive&#13;
that the lower fertility rates observed in 1974-75 indicated more of a&#13;
sudden drop than a sustained decline in fertility over time. 1/ If the drop&#13;
occurred suddenly, it can be assumed that the famine conditions had a consider-&#13;
able effect on the sudden decline in fertility.&#13;
Famine may either be a factor, in triggering a fertility decline or&#13;
may occur coincident with a fertility decline that would have happened&#13;
anyway. In either case, the observed trend or fluctuation in fertility is&#13;
worth analyzing for socioeconomic differentials and/or biological determinants.&#13;
In a few developing countries, such as Kenya, significant rural-&#13;
urban differentials in annual fertility rates as well as in cumulative fertili-&#13;
ty rates are found. This is not the case in Bangladesh indicating the pre-&#13;
industrial character of the urban areas. Also, in the rural areas, controlled&#13;
fertility is not as widespread as it is in the urban areas. In the absence of&#13;
controlled fertility, the natural fertility level is likely to be determined&#13;
1/   A probe into the relationships between the cumulative total fertility&#13;
rate and the current total fertility rate was done by simulating a&#13;
hypothetical population, where the current fertility is assumed to&#13;
decline at a given rate. The results showed that the cumulative total&#13;
fertility remained more or less the same for some years even though the&#13;
current total fertility was declining. After only a lag of 10-15 years&#13;
(depending, of course, on the fertility trend in the past) the effect of&#13;
the decline became-evident for the cumulative total fertility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
by such involuntary factors as the biological factors of health, nutrition, or&#13;
postpartum amenorrhea associated with lactation. Rural-urban fertility levels&#13;
in Bangladesh will reflect the roles that these involuntary factors play in&#13;
both settings. The fertility levels also will reflect the balancing effects&#13;
of the respective constituent socioeconomic groups' natural fertility perform-&#13;
ances. While higher fertility of the rural owner-cultivators may have been&#13;
compensated for by lower fertility of the rural nonowner-cultivators, the&#13;
lower fertility of urban higher socioeconomic groups, such as officials or&#13;
businessmen, may have been compensated by higher fertility of the urban&#13;
nonagricultural laborers. The net effect seems to be no significant urban-&#13;
rural differences in fertility.&#13;
The absence of a significant difference in cumulative fertility&#13;
between rural and urban areas or across occupational groups suggests that&#13;
the classifications failed to capture the differential pattern. With some&#13;
decline in the overall current fertility, one would expect some differentials&#13;
in cumulative fertility across socioeconomic groups. 1/ An alternative&#13;
explanation is that the level of cumulative fertility in Bangladesh still&#13;
conforms to that of natural rather than controlled fertility. Choice or&#13;
regulation does not seem to play a significant role in the determination of&#13;
family size; the norm of family size is uniformly high across socioeconomic&#13;
strata. The insignificant role of choice of family size can be consistent&#13;
with the observed decline in current (annual) fertility rates between 1960-62&#13;
and 1974-75, if this decline only involves a dip around 1974-75 because of&#13;
famine conditions, rather than a sustained decline over the entire period.&#13;
1/   We, however, note that although most groups considered in our analysis&#13;
,.,have a similar level of fertility, a few of the groups considered have&#13;
some difference. For the reported number of children ever born, the&#13;
range is 4.31 to 3.87 in 1969 and 4.23 to 3.58 in 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
The data on cumulative fertility seem to disprove the Arthur-McNicoll&#13;
thesis that uncertainty or some sort of economic incentive differentially&#13;
induces different socioeconomic groups to seek and to attain different family&#13;
sizes. Also, no strong support exists for the notion of some authors (Stoeckel&#13;
and Chowdhury, 1969a) that an inverse relationship between socioeconomic&#13;
status and fertility has already begun to emerge in Bangladesh.&#13;
Factors Affecting Individual Fertility&#13;
Two measures of individual fertility are used in this paper:&#13;
(1) cumulative marital fertility and (2) adjusted measure of cumulative&#13;
marital fertility. The second measure is actually derived from the first by&#13;
adjusting for both age at marriage and duration of marriage. This is done by&#13;
dividing the number of children born to a woman by the number of children a&#13;
woman would have had, if she had reproduced according to a schedule of natural&#13;
fertility from her date of marriage to the date of the survey. See Boulier&#13;
and Rosenzweig, 1978; their work is based on the cumulative, single-year&#13;
natural fertility schedule constructed by Coale and Trussell, 1974. The&#13;
latter allows for more precise estimates of fertility differentials than the&#13;
total number of children.&#13;
The explanatory variables used in the analysis are as follows:&#13;
(1) age at marriage; (2) couple's educational level of combined completed&#13;
years of school or college 1/; (3) membership in Hindu community (dummy = 1&#13;
if Hindu); (4) "ever use" of contraceptive (dummy = 1, if used); (5) child&#13;
mortality index constructed by dividing the total dead infants by total live&#13;
1/   This unconventional variable was constructed to capture the additive ef-&#13;
fect of husband's and wife's education. In Bangladesh, most women&#13;
have no education; but for the small proportion of families where women&#13;
have some education, they are expected to strengthen the effect of the&#13;
husband's education.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

births; (6) female labor force participation outside hotme (dummy = 1, if yes);&#13;
(7) number of household assets owned; (8) officials or businessmen occupation-&#13;
al categories (dummy = 1, if yes); (9) nonowner-cultivators or nonagricultural-&#13;
laborers occupational categories (dummy = 1, if yes), and owner-cultivators&#13;
occupational category (suppressed).   These variables are employed in the&#13;
analysis because they are common to both surveys. In addition, some addition-&#13;
al variables -- duration of breast-feeding, husband's absence from home in the&#13;
year preceding the date of the survey, child's age when fed supplemental food,&#13;
and duration of post-partum amenorrhea--are available only in the World&#13;
Fertility Survey.&#13;
Tables 8 and 9 present the results of a multiple regression analysis&#13;
using the total number of children ever born as the dependent variable.&#13;
Table 8 shows that in 1976 and 1969, corresponding to the two respective&#13;
survey dates, only three-variables -- child mortality experience, ever use of&#13;
contraceptives, and membership in the Hindu community -- have a significant&#13;
relationship with the dependent variable, controlling for the obvious effects&#13;
of age and age at marriage. The negative effect of age at marriage seems to&#13;
be stronger in 1976 than in 1969. A couple's educationel level had signifi-&#13;
cant, although small, negative effect on the children born in 1976. But the&#13;
effect of education becomes insignificant with the control of age at marriage,&#13;
which shows that it is through delayed marriage that education leads to lower&#13;
cumulative fertility. This variable is dominated by the husband's education.&#13;
When both the husband's and the wife's educational levels were considered&#13;
separately, the size and sign of the husband's education came close to those&#13;
shown for the couple's education in tables 8 and 9. In Bangladesh, differen-&#13;
tial effects of a husband's and a wife's education on fertility, are not&#13;

evident from these data, although some household data show a difference.&#13;
Membership in the Hindu community leads to significantly lower cumulative&#13;
fertility in both years. This result is expected because the Hindu religion,&#13;
in comparison with Islam, is more favorably disposed to the idea of limiting&#13;
family size and to the practice of contraception. Many orthodox Muslim&#13;
villagers in Bangladesh view children as dictated by the will of God, thus,&#13;
practicing contraception is against religious belief. Although this attitude&#13;
is changing and most religious leaders favor family planning, there is still a&#13;
sizable number of people who remain opposed to family planning on religious&#13;
grounds. Compared to this, Hinduism has been more favorable to family plan-&#13;
ning. Child mortality experience leads to higher cumulative fertility accord-&#13;
ing to both the surveys.&#13;
Ever use of contraceptives also is positively related to cumulative&#13;
fertility in both the surveys. This reflects the more frequent use of contra-&#13;
ceptives by those who have more children. This finding is quite expected and&#13;
is consistent with results in other household surveys. 1/ If the fertility&#13;
during the period when contraceptives are used is considered instead of&#13;
cumulative frequency, the relationship would be negative. The variable&#13;
analyzed is ever use of contraceptives, which is different from a variable&#13;
reflecting a sustained, effective use of contraceptives. Urban residence&#13;
seems to have a small but significant positive effect on the cumulative&#13;
fertility only in the Impact Survey. Other variables such as female labor&#13;
force participation, membership in particular occupational groups, or posses-&#13;
sion of household assets do not have any significant effect on the cumulative&#13;
fertility.&#13;

Table 9 presents the regression results by age groups, which allows&#13;
for the possibility that fertility levels among age groups are affected by the&#13;
explanatory variables because of the age differences. The table shows that&#13;
age at marriage has a stronger negative effect on fertility in the younger age&#13;
groups in both the surveys. However, in 1969 age at marriage did not have&#13;
any significant effect in the oldest age group, 36 and above. Membership in&#13;
the Hindu community had a negative effect on fertility in the age group 21 to&#13;
35 in both years. For those 36 and older, the significant negative effect on&#13;
fertility of Hindu membership is observed only in the 1969 data.&#13;
Child mortality experience had a significant positive effect on&#13;
fertility in all the age groups in both surveys, except the age group, 36 and&#13;
above, in the 1969 survey. Urban residence had a significant positive effect&#13;
on fertility only in the youngest age group, 10 to 20, in 1976.&#13;
Table 10 presents the regression results with the alternative&#13;
measure of cumulative fertility as the dependent variable. 1/ The strong&#13;
negative effect of age on fertility is seen in both the surveys -- 1969 and&#13;
1976. Child mortality experience had a significant positive effect in both&#13;
the surveys. Other factors that affected the fertility index positively are&#13;
urban residence and ever use of contraceptives. For officials, business, and&#13;
Laborers fertility was affected negatively only in the 1976 survey; Hinduism&#13;
iad a negative effect on fertility both in the 1976 and 1969 surveys.&#13;
In table 11, the effects of a few more independent variables are&#13;
documented. These variables are found only in World Fertility Survey data and&#13;
:Lnvolve the adjusted measure of cumulative fertility. The data show that, in&#13;
I.   As noted earlier, this measure is standardized for the age-fecundity&#13;
relationship and for the exposure to the risk of conception associated&#13;
with the duration of marriage.&#13;

addition to the two variables age of mother and child mortality experience,&#13;
other factors that exhibited significant associations were: lengthy breast-&#13;
feeding, husband's absence from home, and a child's age when fed supplemental&#13;
food. All these associations except thaitof child mortality experience were&#13;
negative]y correlated with fertility.&#13;
Several observations can be made from the foregoing multivariate&#13;
analysis of individual fertility. Consistent with the results in the aggre-&#13;
gate fertility analysis, multivariate analysis shows that only minor differen-&#13;
ces in fertility exist among the individuals who differ by such socioeconomic&#13;
characteristics as education, exposure to urban influences, or socioeconomic&#13;
status. The results of the analysis are consistent with the hypothesis of the&#13;
noncontracepting nature of the Bangladesh population, giving essentially a&#13;
uniform level of fertility across socioeconomic groups. However, the&#13;
fertility rate is only moderately high when considered by the standard of a&#13;
Western noncontracepting population (for example, the Hutterites).&#13;
The small differences in individual fertility as well as the mod-&#13;
erate level of the overall fertility rate seem to be more explained by biologi-&#13;
cal or involuntary factors rather than by any voluntary regulation of fertili-&#13;
ty. This is evident in the sign of the coefficient for the responses to ever&#13;
use of contraceptives in both surveys. Only at the later stage of the family&#13;
building cycle, when a couple already has several children, is the decision&#13;
made to use contraceptives. The positive effect of child mortality experience&#13;
on the cumulative fertility both in its crude and adjusted measures indicates&#13;
that child mortality leads to higher fertility by a shortened period of&#13;
postpartum lactational amenorrhea associated with a child's death. Thus, the&#13;
woman is more likely to conceive than she would have been. Similarly, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
negative effect of breast-feeding on the adjusted measure of cumulative&#13;
fertility indicates that duration of breast feeding affects fertility in&#13;
Bangladesh. These findings are consistent with the results of previous&#13;
'studies, that documented.'significantly reduced postpartum amenorrhea from&#13;
interruption of breast-feeding associated with infant deaths (Chowdhury et&#13;
al., 1976; Chen et al., 1974). Thus, the data from one area seem to reflect&#13;
the pattern in the whole country. This finding is significant for understand-&#13;
ing the trends and differentials in fertility in Bangladesh, where most infant&#13;
deaths occur in the neonatal period, and breast-feeding is nearly universal&#13;
and lengthy (Chen et al. 1974).&#13;
The strong negative effect of age on the adjusted measure of&#13;
cumulative fertility, which is standardized for age and duration of marriage,&#13;
indicates that secondary sterility or fecundity impairment is prevalent&#13;
among the older reproductive women of Bangladesh. This sterility may be&#13;
caused by the combined effects of lactation and repeated childbirths that are&#13;
associated with malnutrition or morbidity among the older women. For example,&#13;
the repeated childbirths and associated lactation might have accelerated the&#13;
maternal depletion of nutrient of older mothers. Yet, by diminishing the&#13;
quantity and quality of breast-milk, maternal malnutrition or morbidity might&#13;
have promoted more strenuous infant sucking and thereby prolong amenorrhea&#13;
indirectly. Other studies in Bangladesh reported similar findings. Huffman&#13;
et al. (1978) found older women more amenorrheic than younger women, just as&#13;
Chen et al. (1974) found low fecundity of older reproductive women.&#13;
The significant negative effect of the husband's absence from&#13;
home on the adjusted measure of cumulative fertility indicates that many&#13;
men in Bangladesh seek employment away from home which reduces fertility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

through involuntary abstinence. The negative effect of education on fertility&#13;
was caused by postponing marriage. This effect seems to have occurred only in&#13;
1976; in 1969 education was positively related to cumulative fertility.&#13;
The reversal perhaps indicates that the positive effect of better health&#13;
and better nutrition on fertility in 1969 was not yet offset by the negative&#13;
effect of education. Similarly, the positive effect of urban residence&#13;
on the cumulative fertility in the youngest age group, 10 to 20 in 1976&#13;
reflects improved health. Increases in fertility among married women between&#13;
'he age of 15 and 19 in urban areas were also found by Schultz (1970).&#13;
KNOWLEDGE. ATTITUDES, AND PRACTICES (KAP) OF CONTRACEPTION&#13;
Comparison of KAP Questions in 1976 and 1969 Surveys&#13;
The analysis of fertility trends and differentials among Bangladesh&#13;
women in the previous sections of this report reveals that, although some&#13;
raduction in annual fertility rates has occurred in recent years, a moderately&#13;
high level of cumulative fertility has remained more or less constant across&#13;
most socioeconomic strata during the 1969-76 period. It is possible that the&#13;
re:cent dip in annual fertility is caused by the prevailing famine conditions,&#13;
t1,e effect of which is not yet apparent in the trend, or cumulative fertility.&#13;
Alternatively, it could be assumed that the recent fall in annual fertility is&#13;
the beginning of a long-term trend. If the decline in annual fertility in&#13;
re:ent years is connected with famine conditions, it would probably not&#13;
irtirolve advancements in contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and practices&#13;
(KM'P). If it were unconnected, one would expect sizable improvements in KAP&#13;
from 1960-62 to 1974-75. Thus, analysis of changes over time in KAP will not&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
only furnish information on how the population of Bangladesh is preparing for&#13;
a fertility decline in the future, but also will shed light on whether famine&#13;
conditions were coincidental to or a factor in the fertility decline.&#13;
The following sections of this study examine the status of contracep-&#13;
tive knowledge, attitudes, and practices in Bangladesh and the changes, if any,&#13;
during the 1969 to 1976 period.    Unlike fertility, the authors expect that&#13;
contraceptives (KAP) would be significantly related to important socioeconomic&#13;
variables. This is because attitude and knowledge about contraception and its&#13;
practice are more likely to change in the short-run than fertility levels.&#13;
Time has proved to be important in tracing the changes in knowledge&#13;
and attitudes about contraception and in its use. Favorable attitudes and&#13;
awareness do not necessarily lead to practice. For example, most KAP surveys&#13;
have shown gaps between knowledge and practice at a given time indicating that&#13;
actual behavior is slower to change than attitudes. However, it is reasonable&#13;
zo expect that with more extensive knowldge and more favorable disposition to&#13;
4iontraception among potential users, the practice rate will also tend to be&#13;
higher with perhaps some time lag.&#13;
In addition to the expected link between attitudes about and prac-&#13;
tices of contraception--and their eventual effect on fertility--knowledge&#13;
and awareness variables are useful by other ways. First, these variables&#13;
are good indications of the impact of a family planning program in the short-&#13;
run. Second, family planning knowledge, attitudes, and practices are directly&#13;
related to the health objective of the program--that is, spacing children&#13;
fDr better maternal and infant health.&#13;
The KAP questions asked by the two surveys are similar, as the fol-&#13;

Major Findings about KAP Status&#13;
Table 12 shows the percentages of the women who either know about&#13;
o:ie or more methods of contraception, have ever used contraceptives, or intend&#13;
ti) use contraceptives in the future. These percentages have been computed by&#13;
the husband's occupational groups for both 1969 and 1976. In addition, table&#13;
13 depicts the mean ideal family size chosen by the husband's occupational&#13;
groups for both the surveys. From the tables, it is evident that in both 1969&#13;
and 1976 women whose husbands were officials or businessmen consistently led&#13;
ir. all three contraceptive variables--knowledge, ever use, and intention to&#13;
use. These occupation groups constitute, by and large, the higher socio-&#13;
economic strata. Significantly although responses regarding the contraceptive&#13;
variables differ somewhat, all occupation groups indicated a similar figure--&#13;
approximately four children--as the ideal family size.&#13;
Over time, all occupational groups displayed increases in knowledge,&#13;
us' of contraceptives, and intention to use contraceptives.    Yet the attitude&#13;
about the ideal family size has not changed much (see table 13). In regard to&#13;
conitraceptive knowledge, wives of officials show the highest increase in&#13;
absolute-percentage points--from 49.5 to 67.1 percent. This constitutes an&#13;

actual increase of 36 percent in the general knowledge about contraception.&#13;
Other occupational groups show somewhat lower absolute increases, although the&#13;
percentage increases are often higher. In ever use of contraceptives, again,&#13;
officials show a high absolute increase. Of the remaining groups, wives of&#13;
nonowner-cultivators show the lowest absolute increase in contraceptive use&#13;
from 8.7 to 13.0 percent. However, the lower socioeconomic strata often made&#13;
relatively the same or more progress than those of higher status. For example,&#13;
wives of owner-cultivators show the highest relative percentage increase (219&#13;
percent) in the ever use of contraceptives category between 1969 and 1976.&#13;
When the trends in intention to use contraceptives in the future are examined,&#13;
as in table 12, we also find that the wives of those in all occupational&#13;
groups except nonagricultural laborers show similar increases. Table 12 also&#13;
shows that the percentages of women knowing about contraceptive methods or&#13;
intending to use contraceptives in future are-significantly higher than the&#13;
percentage of women who actually ever used any contraceptive method.&#13;
These results from the 1969 and 1976 surveys reveal interesting&#13;
features of the changes in KAP status among Bangladesh women. In tables 14 to&#13;
22 we further analyze the relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and ever&#13;
use of contraceptives and other independent variables--education, parity,&#13;
residence, and household assets. Essentially, two methods were used. First,&#13;
the dichotomous dependent variables were crosstabulated with some of the&#13;
independent variables. Second, unweighted least square analysis was used for&#13;
those dependent variables in interval form. Two variables were crosstabulated,&#13;
the percentage of ever users and the percentage of those who intend to use&#13;

done because the dependent variables occur in interval form.&#13;
Ever Use of Contraceptives. Tables 14 through 16 show the per-&#13;
centage distribution of those who ever used contraceptives by education,&#13;
parity, or urban-rural residence. Table 14 shows that in both surveys&#13;
those with higher education or those with more living children have a higher&#13;
percentage of contraceptive users than those with lower education or fewer&#13;
living children.   This pattern of higher percentage of contraceptive users&#13;
with more education also appears within urban-rural residence (table 15) and&#13;
within parity status (table 16). However, the difference is more marked among&#13;
the urban residents and among those with less than five living children.&#13;
Table 14 shows that those with no education and those with less than five&#13;
living children show higher percentage increases in contraceptive use between&#13;
1969 and 1976 than those with primary or more education and those with more&#13;
than four living children, respectively.&#13;
When disaggregated by education within urban-rural areas in table&#13;
15 and within parity status in table 16, an interesting pattern emerges.&#13;
The rural residents of all educational categories show higher percentage&#13;
increases in contraceptive use than the corresponding categories of the urban&#13;
residents. In all educational categories- those women with less than five&#13;
living children also show higher percentage increases in contraceptive use&#13;
1/   For variables, an unweighted least square analysis with dependent varia-&#13;
bles in dichotomous form is possible, but the observed rates of the&#13;
variables do not satisfy the condition to use this analysis, since the&#13;
proportions are less than 30 percent.&#13;

than the corresponding categories of those with five or more children.&#13;
However, both within urban-rural areas and within parity status, those with no&#13;
education show higher percentage increases in ever use of contraceptives than&#13;
those with primary or more education.&#13;
Intention to Use Contraceptives in the Future. Table 17 shows that&#13;
in absolute terms those with no education show greater increase in the inten-&#13;
tion to use contraception than those with primary or more education. This is&#13;
true of both urban and rural residents (table 18).&#13;
The intention to use contraceptives seems to have increased more&#13;
among couples with less than five living children than those with five or more&#13;
children (see table 17). Table 19 disaggregates the data on intention to&#13;
use contraceptives, by education, and by urban-rural residence. The table&#13;
shows that the higher increase in intention to use contraceptives among the&#13;
uneducated is true both for those women with fewer than and those with more&#13;
than five living children. However, among those women with a primary education,&#13;
higher parity women seem to have a higher percentage increase in the intention&#13;
to use contraceptive in the future compared with women of lower parity.    The&#13;
results show that a similar set of factors and interacting processes explain&#13;
differences between intention of using contraceptives and their actual use.&#13;
Knowledge of Contraceptives. Table 20 presents regression analysis&#13;
results on the knowledge of contraceptives measure by the number of methods&#13;
known. It shows that both in 1969 and 1976 a couple's educational level,&#13;
household assets, urban residence, female labor force participation, and&#13;
number of living children have significant positive effects on the number&#13;
of contraceptive types known.&#13;

Ideal Family Size. Ideal family size is examined in table 21,&#13;
for both 1969 and 1976. A couple's education, urban residence, and female&#13;
labor force participation are negatively related to the ideal family size.&#13;
Religion had a significant. negative effect on ideal family size only in the&#13;
1976 survey. The number of living children was positively related to ideal&#13;
family size in both periods.&#13;
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY&#13;
Several inferences can be drawn from the analysis. Unlike fertili-&#13;
ty, knowledge and attitudes about the practices of contraception are signifi-&#13;
cantly related to key socioeonomic variables. In 1969 and 1976 ever use of&#13;
contraception and intention to adopt family planning are positively related to&#13;
education and to the number of living children. This is true in both the&#13;
urban and rural areas. Similarly, in both years wives of officials and&#13;
businessmen who are more exposed to modern sectors or who represent higher&#13;
socioeconomic strata are more advanced than women from lower socioeconomic&#13;
groups in knowledge and use of contraception or in intent to adopt family&#13;
planning. Members of the lower social strata, however, made as much or&#13;
more rapid progress (measured by percentage increases) than those from the&#13;
higher social strata in many aspects of contraceptive awareness and practice.&#13;
This advancement could be caused by the combined effects of the economic&#13;
pressure of many children and the massive governmental family planning propa-&#13;
ganda and counseling services. The government's program might have made&#13;
fertility control available and socially respectable. Thus, people from the&#13;
lower social strata respond the same as those from the higher social strata to&#13;
the promotional activities of voluntary family planning program.&#13;

However, the economic pressure of many children induces people with&#13;
lower educational levels to consider contraceptive use or intent to use&#13;
contraceptives more favorably (tables 16 and 18). To the extent that educa-&#13;
tion is a proxy for socioeconomic status, economic pressure from high parity&#13;
makes people of lower socioeconomic strata more favorably disposed towards&#13;
fertility control than others. Possibly, poorer families want to limit the&#13;
economic pressure of high fertility, which further aggravates already poor&#13;
conditions.&#13;
The negative effect that education or female labor force participa-&#13;
tion has on the ideal family size (table 21) indicates that exposure to&#13;
out-of-home influence leads to a favorable attitude toward small family&#13;
size. However, their effects are not big enough to give rise to any signifi-&#13;
cant difference in the mean ideal family size among occupational groups&#13;
(table 13). The expressed ideal family size has not changed significantly&#13;
between the 1969 and 1976 periods (table 13). The positive effect of the&#13;
number of living children on the ideal family size (table 21) in both surveys&#13;
could be explained as a rationalization by a respondent with many children.&#13;
Some population theorists have speculated on this type of rationalization.&#13;
Hauser (1967), for example, holds that the response to a question on ideal&#13;
family size is highly correlated with the actual or completed family size;&#13;
"the ideal tends to be what has actually occurred."&#13;
In absolute terms, the proportion of those actually using contracep-&#13;
tives rather than the proportion of those intending to use them is much&#13;
tower in the lower than in the higher socioeconomic strata (table 12). Thus,&#13;
although massive governmental family planning propaganda together with demogra-&#13;
phic pressure might have created a relatively similar favorable attitude&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
towards fertility regulation in general, those in the lower socioeconomic&#13;
groups seem to be slower to actually adopt birth control methods. However,&#13;
even the lower socioeconomic groups have made fairly rapid progress in this&#13;
regard during the period studied.&#13;
The changes in contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and the practices&#13;
--discussed in this paper--have implications for population policy and planning&#13;
in underdeveloped countries. The KAP changes suggest that massive information,&#13;
about counseling, and services in family planning seem to have a relatively&#13;
greater effect on KAP at all levels of society than on fertility during the&#13;
same period. The effect of information and health services on fertility&#13;
appears to be negligible. The practice of contraception is significantly&#13;
associated with development indicators such as education or urban contact&#13;
(tables 14 and 15). However, the actual effect of these development indica-&#13;
tors on fertility, as the analysis reveals, remains negligible (tables 8, 9,&#13;
and 10). One explanation for this is that the institutional settings of a high&#13;
fertility culture are still dominant in Bangladesh across all socioeconomic&#13;
groups.   Part of this dominance results from their traditional family relation-&#13;
ships that are maintained even when people have more education (Husain,&#13;
1956). In addition, urban-developmental changes have not seriously affected&#13;
traditional family-economic roles or fertility norms.&#13;
A more plausible explanation is the significant time lag that&#13;
usually occurs between the increase of contraceptive practice and the begin-&#13;
ning of a decline in fertility. The seven-year timespan between the two&#13;
surveys may be too short to show any effect on fertility. Possibly, contracep-&#13;
tive practice will increase to avoid unwanted births in the short term, but&#13;
only in the long run will fertility- decline become significant as the family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

size norm changes. Given the improvement in living conditions in Bangladesh&#13;
between the survey years, fertility could have gone up; this probably has been&#13;
averted by an increase In contraceptive practice. A significant decline in&#13;
fertility is likely to become evident as the preference for smaller family&#13;
size becomes more widespread.&#13;
The results show that some latent demand for contraception exists in&#13;
Bangladesh. Yet, it is doubtful whether this demand would translate into&#13;
significant fertility decline in the near future with only the existing&#13;
voluntary family planning services. However, recent increases in the propor-&#13;
tion of ever users, in knowledge, and in the intent to use contraceptives&#13;
between 1969 and 1976--especially among lower socioeconomic strata--is an&#13;
encouraging trend.&#13;

            Fertility and its regulation in Bangladesh
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Data from two comparable national
            surveys--taken in 1968-69 and 1975-76--are used to study
            fertility trends, levels, regulations, and their determining
            factors. Annual marital fertility rates declined
            substantially between the two surveys, but the total number
            of children ever born to each married woman did not decline.
            This is explained in part by the nature of these fertility
            measures. The decline in the annual (current) fertility
            rates, if sustained, lowers the cumulative rate only after a
            time lag. In Bangladesh, the observed dip in the annual
            fertility rates in 1974-75 represents a recent phenomenon;
            it perhaps reflects to some degree the effect on fecundity
            of the 1974-75 famine in Bangladesh. To the extent this is
            true, the annual fertility rates will revert to the previous
            roughly constant trend. If, however, this recent dip in
            annual fertility rates is a part of a sustained trend of
            decline, the number of children ever born to each married
            woman will decrease in the future.
