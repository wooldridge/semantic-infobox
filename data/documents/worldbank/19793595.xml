         tbe Report and Recommendations on the .proposed. 1oa.n to the&#13;
         Union of South A.tl'ica.    I wo.uld like t.o ,call on Mr. I..ejeune&#13;
&#13;
         t1ret.&#13;
              MR. LEJBUNI: Jilt. Chairman, gentlemen, this is the fitth&#13;
         loan that we are proposing to south Africa.        These five loans&#13;
         have been made over a period ot ti ve years.        I think we can&#13;
         say Without Question that this association bas been a&#13;
&#13;
         fruitful one.    South Africa baa bad and continues to bave a&#13;
         real need for expanding basic servtcee, such as transport&#13;
         and power, and the local resources there have not been&#13;
         suf'f1c1ent to meet this need.     The Bankâ&#128;¢s proviston ot&#13;
&#13;
         capital bas, therefore, been a real help and a significant&#13;
         item in their development.&#13;
              In south A1"1"1ca, one can see the results of the Bankâ&#128;¢s&#13;
         efforts, and Â·it is a considerable satistaction to tboee ot&#13;
         us who go there trom time to time to see on the gz-ound the&#13;
&#13;
         physical results.     The ftrst thing one sees actually is the&#13;
         station in Johannesburg, a large and imposing one, wbiob bas&#13;
         been financed   by   us, and a very important thing it is,&#13;
         considering the large amount of commuting tratt1c that goes&#13;
         in and out ot Johannesburg, particularly native labor.&#13;
              To say that the association baa been tru1ttul does not,&#13;
         however, mean that we are entirely easy in our minds about&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  4&#13;

&#13;
                in South Atr1ca, as well ne in the other less advanced&#13;
                countries ot the continent.    But in South Atl'ica, as in Bast&#13;

          tor the kind ot borrowing now contemplated. The proposed&#13;
           borrowing in the New York. market 1s evidence that cautious&#13;

                You ma7 be interested to lmow the latest in.tormation&#13;

           bonds, bearing interest at 4 percent J $2 million in 5â&#128;¢:vear&#13;
           bonds, bearing interest at 4-1/8 percent.       Nov, all these&#13;

            This partial transcript, from the
            session of the Executive Directors held on Monday, November
            28, 1955, covers only a proposed loan to the Union of South
            Africa for the Third Transport Project. In addition to
            covering the details of the loan, the meeting also provided
            an overview of the political and economic landscape of South
            Africa as of 1955. In particular, the issue of race
            relations and the possible risk to economic growth received
            considerable attention. The Executive Directors resolved to
            approve the loan.
