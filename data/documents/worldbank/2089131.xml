&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 2: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
(i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterpnses in the territories of&#13;
member countries A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the project is&#13;
located must be guaranteed as to pnncipal, interest and other charges by the member or its central&#13;
bank or a comparable agency of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the member itself&#13;
has been obtained in all such cases to date&#13;
(ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member&#13;
countries Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, eco-&#13;
nomic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness&#13;
(m) In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment Deci-&#13;
sions to make loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's eco-&#13;
nomic structure, including assessments of its resources and abihty to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
exchange to meet debt-service obligations&#13;
(iv) IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevaling market conditions (taking into account the member's&#13;
overall external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under&#13;
conditions which, in the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower IBRD is intended to pro-&#13;
mote pnvate investment, not to compete with it.&#13;
(v) The use of loan proceeds is supervised IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are&#13;
used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-&#13;
effectiveness This policy is enforced primanly by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation&#13;
establishing, to IBRD's satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are&#13;
made in conformity with the applicable lending agreements and (b) to maximize competition in the&#13;
procurement of goods and services by using, wherever possible, international competitive bidding or,&#13;
when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum economy and efficiency&#13;
Loan disbursements are subject to the fulfillment of  Figure 2. IBRD Lending Commitments&#13;
conditions set out in the loan agreement. During&#13;
project implementation, IBRD staff with experience&#13;
in the sector or the country involved periodically visit  100&#13;
project sites to review progress, monitor compliance  -&#13;
with IBRD policies and assist in resolving any prob-&#13;
lems that may arise After completion, projects are&#13;
evaluated by an independent IBRD unit and the find-  75                - &#13;
ings reported directly to the Executive Directors to&#13;
determine the extent to which the project's major&#13;
objectives were met Similar appraisal, approval,&#13;
supervision and evaluation procedures apply in the&#13;
case of IBRD adjustment and other non-project loans.&#13;
Lending Instruments                                25&#13;
IBRD lending generally falls into one of two catego-                        Adjustment&#13;

Box 5: Guarantee Instruments&#13;
* Partial risk guarantees cover debt-service defaults on a loan that may result from nonperformance of govern-&#13;
ment obligations These are defined in the contracts negotiated between the government or a government-&#13;
sponsored entity and the private company responsible for implementing the project The IBRD guarantee is&#13;
limited to backing the government's obligations, the obligations of the private company contained in the&#13;
project agreements are not covered and thus the private lenders assume the risk of nonperformance by the&#13;
private company&#13;
* Partial credit guarantees are used for public sector projects when there is a need to extend loan maturities&#13;
and guarantee specified interest or principal payments on loans to the government or its instrumentalities&#13;
This approach may be most appropriate when the lenders are not willing to accept the sovereign risk of the&#13;
host government for a term long enough to meet the needs of the project By guaranteeing later maturities,&#13;
such partial credit guarantees help induce the market to extend the term to the maximum risk it can bear&#13;
* Policy-based guarantees are partial credit guarantees that cover a portion of debt-service on a borrowing by&#13;
an eligible member country from private foreign creditors in support of agreed structural, institutional and&#13;
social policies and reforms. These guarantees are an extension of partial credit guarantees for projects The&#13;
guaranteed portion of the debt-service could consist of a combination of interest and principal payments,&#13;
but the actual structure is determined on a case-by-case basis Elgibility for IBRD adjustment lending is a&#13;
necessary condition for eligibility for this type of instrument The terms of this instrument are the same as&#13;
project-based partial credit guarantees Matunty and level of fees will be standard if the guarantee is made&#13;
in situations comparable to those under which a structural adjustment loan would be made, however, if the&#13;
guarantee is made in connection with a special structural adjustment loan, then it will be at special struc-&#13;
tural adjustment loan equivalent terms This guarantee product was launched in FY 1999. Initially, IBRD is&#13;
proceeding with a pilot program of up to $2,000 million. As of June 30, 2001, $409 million had been&#13;
approved Once the $2,000 million level is reached, the Executive Directors will review the program&#13;

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development as of June 30, 2001 and 2000, including the sununary statement of loans and&#13;
the statement of subscrptions to capital stock and voting power as of June 30, 2001, and the&#13;
related statements of income, comprehensive mcome, changes in retained earnings, and cash&#13;
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2001. These financial&#13;
statements are the responsibility of the Internatonal Bank for Reconstruction and Development's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on&#13;
our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits m accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting&#13;
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessmg the&#13;
accounting principles used and significant estmates made by management, as well as evaluating&#13;

            This Annual Report covers the period
            from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, and details the World
            Bank strategy for meeting the poverty challenge. After the
            Introduction, Chapter 1 provides an overview of Bank
            activities in 2001 that focused on multi-dimensional
            support, improved development effectiveness, increased
            funding volume, formalized the country business model,
            evolved country assistance strategies by preparing them in
            consultation, developed investment vehicles to support
            low-income countries, created a task force to consider the
            response to the needs of middle-income countries, developed
            an innovative IBRD and IDA program and project lending to
            support strong national programs, assessment of the
            Strategic Compact, the use of the World Bank Institute to
            empower through knowledge and setting out a strategic
            framework for future directions. Chapter 2 describes the
            role of the Board of Executive Directors. Chapter 3 examines
            the thematic issues the Bank is tackling, such as addressing
            the social, institutional, and economic dimensions of
            poverty; investing in people; supporting private sector
            development; building strong financial systems; and building
            effective legal and judicial systems. Chapter 4 discusses
            the Bank's role in fighting poverty and aiding
            development region by region. Chapter 5 looks at Bank
            project performance. Chapter 6 focuses on Bank partnerships,
            Chapter 7 sums up approved projects, and Chapter 8 provides
