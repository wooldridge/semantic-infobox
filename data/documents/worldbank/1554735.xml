Abstract&#13;
This paper (i) presents a partial survey of the literature on the&#13;
economics of vocational training to draw some lessons for evaluations and&#13;
(ii) indicates how such evaluations may be undertaken using data on pay,&#13;
inputs and outputs.&#13;
There are three important lessons. First, social, corporate and&#13;
private returns to vocational training in developing countries appear to&#13;
be high enough to justify expanding training activity. However, training&#13;
in industrial institutes and vocational secondary schools is less cost-&#13;
effective than more informal firm-based training, at least in Kenya, India&#13;
and Israel. Also, Latin American data indicate that there may be substituability&#13;
between schooling and formal institutional vocational training. Second, in&#13;
some sectors a more labour-intensive method of production is economically&#13;
more efficient than current methods. This may, in turn, imply the need for&#13;
more, not less, skilled labour and vocational training. Further, given&#13;
technology and output, unskilled and skilled labour appear to be substitutes,&#13;
rather than complements, in the production process. Third, sophisticated&#13;
production function analyses are plagued by statistical and measurement&#13;
problems. If they are not resolved, estimation techniques are unlikely to&#13;
be able to pick up any relationship between trained labour and output among&#13;
firms. However, there are alternatives. Many input and output measures&#13;
such as performance rating and downtime are available for more modest&#13;
evaluations.&#13;
Training can be evaluated using earnings data or output and input&#13;
data. In all cases there are technical problems including sample size,&#13;
control groups, the use of longitudinal data and difficulties caused by&#13;
labour mobility. In the face of such problems with earnings data a simpler&#13;
before/after plant level study of changes in inputs or output associated&#13;
with training may offer the most tractable evaluation method.&#13;

La pr6sente etude i) est une enquete partielle des documents relatifs&#13;
a la rentabilit6 de la formation professionnelle, destinee a tirer les&#13;
lesons de 1'exp6rience, et ii) indique les methodes d'6valuation de la&#13;
formation professionnelle fondees sur les donnees relatives au salaire, a&#13;
la production et aux facteurs de production.&#13;
Selon ses conclusions, trois legons importantes peuvent etre d6gagees.&#13;
Premierement, il semble que les avantages de la formation professionnelle,&#13;
sur le plan social et prive et du point de vue de l'entreprise, soient&#13;
suffisants pour justifier son developpement. Toutefois, la formation pro-&#13;
diguee dans les instituts industriels et les 6tablissements secondaires&#13;
d'enseignement professionnel est moins rentable qu'une formation moins&#13;
structuree, au sein de l'entreprise, du moins dans des pays tels que le&#13;
Kenya, l'Inde et.Israel. D'autre part, selon les donnees recueillies dans&#13;
les pays d'Amerique latine, l'enseignement normal et la formation profes-&#13;
sionnelle structur6e dispensee dans des institutions peuvent se substituer&#13;
l'un a l'autre. Deuxiemement, une m6thode de production davantage ax6e&#13;
sur le recours intensif a la main-d'oeuvre s'avere plus rentable, dans&#13;
certains secteurs, que les methodes actuellement utilisees. De cette&#13;
conclusion il decoule qu'une main-d'oeuvre qualifiee plus abondante est&#13;
necessaire, par consequent que l'expansion de la formation professionnelle&#13;
s'impose. Par ailleurs, compte tenu de la technologie et de la production,&#13;
main-d'oeuvre qualifi6e et non qualifiee semblent interchangeables et non&#13;
pas complementaires dans le processus de production. Troisiemement, les&#13;
analyses approfondies de la fonction de production se heurtent a des pro-&#13;
blemes de statistiques et de calculs. Si ces problemes ne sont pas reso-&#13;
lus, il est peu probable que les m6thodes d'evaluation seront a meme de&#13;
deceler toute relation, quelle qu'elle soit, entre main-d'oeuvre formee et&#13;
production, d'une entreprise a l'autre. I1 existe, cependant, d'autres&#13;
m6thodes d'evaluation, fondees sur bien d'autres criteres, notamment per-&#13;
formance et temps d'arret, dont le champ est plus limite.&#13;
Les donnees relatives aux salaires ou aux facteurs de production et a&#13;
la production peuvent permettre d'evaluer la formation. Dans tous les cas,&#13;
des problemes techniques se presentent, notamment a propos de la taille de&#13;
l'echantillon, des groupes de contr6le, de l'utilisation de donnees longi-&#13;
tudinales et de la mobilite de la main-d'oeuvre. C'est pourquoi la compa-&#13;
raison des fluctuations des facteurs de production ou de la production&#13;
d'une entreprise, avec et sans formation, represente peut-etre la m6thode&#13;
d'evaluation la plus facile a appliquer.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
El presente documento tiene dos finalidades: i) presentar una reseiia&#13;
parcial de la literatura existen-te sobre la economia de la formaci6n&#13;
profesional a fin de extraer algunas enseiianzas para las evaluaciones, y&#13;
ii) indicar c6mo se pueden llevar a cabo tales evaluaciones usando los&#13;
datos de sueldos, insumos y productos.&#13;
Se han extraido tres importantes ensenianzas. La primera es que la&#13;
rentabilidad social, empresarial y privada de la formaci6n profesional en&#13;
los paises en desarrollo parece ser suficientemente elevada para&#13;
justificar la ampliaci6n de los servicios de capacitaci6n. Sin embargo,&#13;
la formaci6n impartida en institutos industriales y escuelas tecnicas&#13;
secundarias es menos eficaz en funci6n de los costos que la mas informal&#13;
impartida en las propias empresas, por lo menos en Kenya, la India e&#13;
Israel. Ademas, los datos de America Latina indican que tal vez haya&#13;
posibilidades de sustituci6n entre la instruccion escolar y la formaci6n&#13;
profesional formal impartida en instituciones. La segunda es que, en&#13;
algunos sectores, un metodo de producci6n basado en el uso intensivo de&#13;
mano de obra es econ6micamente mas eficiente que los m6todos actuales.&#13;
Esto a su vez significaria que se necesita mans mano de obra calificada y&#13;
formaci6n profesional, y no menos. Asimismo, a determinados niveles de&#13;
tecnologia y producci6n, la mano de obra no calificada y la calificada al&#13;
parecer se sustituyen entre si en vez de complementarse en el proceso&#13;
productivo. La tercera es que los analisis complejos de las funciones de&#13;
producci6n se ven dificultados por numerosos problemas estadisticos y de&#13;
medici6n. Si estos no se resuelven, no es probable que las tecnicas de&#13;
estimaci6n permitan determinar la relacion que pueda haber entre el uso de&#13;
mano de obra adiestrada y la producci6n de una firma en comparaci6n con&#13;
otras. Sin embargo, hay otras alternativas. Para las evaluaciones mas&#13;
modestas se dispone de numerosas formas de medir los insumos y productos,&#13;
como la evaluaci6n de la eficiencia del desempenio y del tiempo&#13;
improductivo.&#13;
La eficacia de la capacitaci6n se puede evaluar usando datos de las&#13;
remuneraciones o de los insumos y productos. En todos los casos se&#13;
plantean problemas tecnicos, incluidos el del tamaiio de la muestra, los&#13;
grupos de control, el uso de datos longitudinales y las dificultades&#13;
causadas por la movilidad de la mano de obra. Dados los problemas con los&#13;
datos de las remuneraciones, es posible que un estudio mAs sencillo, a&#13;
nivel de las fabricas, sobre las variaciones en los insumos o productos&#13;
antes y despues del adiestramiento, constituya el metodo de evaluaci6n mas&#13;
factible.&#13;

Summary&#13;
Over a decade ago Mark Blaug - one of the founding fathers of the&#13;
economics of education and training - wrote: "We may as well confess that&#13;
we know almost nothing about the economics of training, its incidence, its&#13;
costs and its benefits." Clearly any economic analysis of training must be&#13;
tentative, but this paper suggests that it is now possible to say some&#13;
sensible things about the evaluation of training.&#13;
This paper has two purposes. First, a partial review of the literature&#13;
on the economics of vocational training is presented (Sections 2-5). This&#13;
review is not conducted in a vacuum. It feeds into the second purpose, which&#13;
is to illuminate methods of evaluating vocational training (Sections 6 and 7).&#13;
Vocational skills are important. Therefore Section 2 examines the&#13;
"where", "when" and "how long" of vocational training. It is possible to&#13;
think of vocational training being located along a continuum. At one&#13;
extreme is secondary school-based training. Next comes training in&#13;
institutions like the vocational secondary school in Israel. Then comes&#13;
the South American type of sandwich training of the SENAI or SENATI variety.&#13;
Finally there is finr-based training.&#13;
It is difficult to generalise on the basis of the studies examined in&#13;
this section because there is no guarantee that the results would be&#13;
replicated over time or across countries. The countries for which LDC&#13;
case studies are available include: Malaysia, Israel, India, Kenya, Brazil,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chile, Colombia and Peru. Nevertheless, some tentative conclusions are&#13;
possible. First, where the rationale for the study was to see if any&#13;
expansion in training facilities was justified the rate of return was&#13;
typically high enough to justify such an expansion. Second, there is some&#13;
evidence that in Brazil and Peru short courses have a bigger payoff than&#13;
longer courses of training. Third, training in industrial institutes and&#13;
vocational secondary schools is less cost effective than more informal&#13;
firm-based training, at least in Kenya, India and Israel. Fourth, the&#13;
payoff to quasi-institutional vocational training in South America is&#13;
higher for those who have only completed primary school than for those&#13;
who have completed secondary school. This suggests that extra formal&#13;
schooling may be substitutable for formal institutional vocational training.&#13;
For a given length and type of vocational training there are diminishing&#13;
returns to formal schooling.&#13;
Evidence (Section 3) from industrialised countries show that the&#13;
private labour market may fail to provide sufficient trained labour because&#13;
of labour mobility among firms, borrowing difficulties for trainees or&#13;
because trainees' wages are set too high. These factors all provide&#13;
justification for public intervention in the training effort.&#13;
Empirical estimates of the substitution technically possible between&#13;
more skilled and less skilled labour is reviewed in Section 4. The results&#13;
have two important implications for vocational training. First, economically&#13;
efficient production technologies sometimes imply more labour intensive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
technology which, in turn will tend to raise the ftnand for skil'gd&#13;
labour and in turn, vocational training reqtvirements increase. SeconC,&#13;
in general, holding output constant, Hess skil'ed 3abour is, apat1y0&#13;
a substitute for skilled labour in t*he prodc'lction process rather than a&#13;
complement to it.   Indeed, it may we/ ! be tOat :;he studies survcyn;d Mra&#13;
understate the true degree of substitO2tability anong 6iffnrent 'l&amp;,ociur types.&#13;
Thus labour is usually measured according to the occupat90n-descripVcn&#13;
(C'electrical engineer") rather than what the person actually does&#13;
("maintenance technician"). Training design certainly needs to oDerate&#13;
on the basis of tasks rather than labels. Although the studies surveyed&#13;
in this section do not relate speciM9cally to the level of the fiTrf&#13;
(typically the data refer to industries or whole economies) the possibility&#13;
that less skilled labour is substitutable for more skilled labour- and&#13;
vice versa, needs careful investigation prior to any ev 'uation of&#13;
vocational training.&#13;
Firm level training studies (Section 5) are quitie rare but the&#13;
economic analysis they contain is generally excelllent. V'   (here are&#13;
several conclusions to note.   First, sophisticated production fu-stions&#13;
are unlikely to be able to pick up any relationship betw@een trained&#13;
labour and output at the level of the fir,    The main reasons ar^&#142;&#13;
/      f-c,h - orld  anktrani   sa     't            training so  haeSe firm&#13;
studies provide helpful guidances particularly on the benefits side of the&#13;
training equation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
statistical: aggregation biases; measurement of variables; selectivity&#13;
biases. Second, individual performance ratings are a sensible and useful&#13;
method of measuring individual productivity, as evidenced by a number of&#13;
successful studies in developing as well as developed countries. Third,&#13;
downtime is a potentially valuable intermediate measurement of output.&#13;
Fourth, although pay is usually a good indicator of the value of a person&#13;
to the firm, it is not always. Therefore, when training is being evaluated,&#13;
if pay is used to measure the value of output a cost-benefit framework will&#13;
generally be accurate but, on occasion, it may not give correct results.&#13;
Methods of evaluating the external efficiency of vocational training&#13;
using earnings data are discussed in Section 6. This section draws, in&#13;
particular, on the illumination provided by the firm-based studies and the&#13;
extensive literature on the evaluation of public manpower and training&#13;
programmes. Methods and objectives are discussed first. Then various&#13;
technical problems are elaborated, including: sample size, control groups,&#13;
the use of longitudinal data and problems caused by labour mobility.&#13;
Finally, the relationship between pay and the productive value of the&#13;
individual is analysed. Many factors exist which might drive a wedge&#13;
between earnings and the true worth of the individual to the firm. These&#13;
factors include: union monopoly power, the fact that a skilled person may&#13;
raise the productivity of co-workers, and labour shortages and surpluses.&#13;
Therefore care must be taken when estimating the corporate and social rate&#13;
of return to vocational training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The cost-effectiveness of vocational trainKng can also be avalysed&#13;
using output and input data (Section 7). A number of pramising olliput&#13;
and input measures exist. For exampkc a before/after study could be ased&#13;
on the output of particular individuals using, for example, p,P. orrt&#13;
earnings or performance ratings to capture productivity changes aissoclated&#13;
with training. Alternatively9, trainig might be analysed at thc o'lant&#13;
level, using plant downtime or the vclue of productIon as the ou'wput&#13;
measures or reductions in labour demand and other factors as thc Input&#13;
measure associated with training.&#13;

SECTION 1&#13;
Introduction and summary&#13;
"We may as well confess that we know almost nothing about the economics of&#13;
training, its incidence, its costs and its benefits" (Blaug 1972 p.199).&#13;
"A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences on the evaluation of&#13;
manpower programs concluded that, after ten years of massive expenditures&#13;
on manpower training programs and many evaluation studies, relatively&#13;
little is known about their impact. This is a disturbing conclusion to&#13;
have been reached about a program that has commanded a significant share&#13;
of society's resources and has been on-going for more than a decade.&#13;
Nevertheless one of the reasons for the ambiguous nature of the estimated&#13;
impacts of manpower training programs is that the evaluation of such&#13;
programs presents many difficult conceptual statistical problems that&#13;
have not been well articulated in the literature. These problems arise&#13;
from the difficulties inherent in analysing and comparing income streams&#13;
over time for different sets of individuals whose characteristics are&#13;
known only imperfectly". (Cooley, McGuire and Prescott 1979 p.120).&#13;
If these quotes are accurate (Blaug still believes so more than a&#13;
decade later) any economic analysis of training must be tentative. Certainly&#13;
the material here is put forward in a spirit of caution. However, some&#13;
good studies have appeared in recent years and it is possible to draw some&#13;
lessons from them concerning the evaluation of training.&#13;
1.1 Purpose&#13;
This paper has two purposes. First, a partial review of the literature&#13;
on the economics of vocational training is presented (for an excellent&#13;
previous review, up to 1973, see Zymelman 1976). Special attention is paid&#13;
to those studies which (i) examine the relative merits of on-the-job versus&#13;
off-the-job vocational training and the interaction between formal schooling&#13;
and vocational training in developing and industrial countries; (ii) analyse&#13;
substitution possibilities between capital and labour and between different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
labour types;   (iii) throw light or the impact' of training costs and on&#13;
output.  This partial review is not conducted in a vacuum.    Xts aim is to&#13;
draw lessons concerning the evaluation of the external efficie7ncy of&#13;
vocational training.   Thus the second purpose of the paper is tc present&#13;
some ideas for such an evaluation.&#13;
Training is like an iceberg - only part of it is Â°n vict!.    or example5&#13;
the costs of off-the-job training in institutoIons are rcasoniabiy straight-&#13;
forward to calculate.   But much of it is hidden from vItew   it    difficult&#13;
to get at the costs and outcomes of things li-ke "'s'ttIne next tr ?'ely",&#13;
the loss of output attributable to skilled workers who spend sor,e of their&#13;
time training less skilled workers, and the value of output prod.)ced by the&#13;
trainee. Further, post-training it ',s difficuti; to trace outpul. to particular&#13;
individuals.  This suggests that case studies u`sing before/after oata or&#13;
paired comparisons ("twins") are likely to ba the most fruitfu! method of&#13;
evaluating corporate training.   This coint may hold wi,h speciak iorce for&#13;
training associated with World Bank projects wvhiclh often invo'!v  output like&#13;
electricity supply, and road miles and port capacity where it would be&#13;
specially difficult to identify output with any one individual.    Even a case&#13;
study is complicated by the heterogenous    nature. of such projects.  Training&#13;
varies by content, location and duration,    Such diversity reoV rs careful&#13;
handling in evaluations.&#13;
Zymelman (1976 pp.91ll) provifes a comprehensive list of tinn       forms&#13;
(see also Nollen 1983).   He points out that there arc three oasÂ½ forms,&#13;
each of which can be sub-divided:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
-  training on the job, both formal and informal;&#13;
-  training off the job in schools, training centres or places of&#13;
work;&#13;
-  combined types of training such as apprenticeship    with formal&#13;
instruction off the job, on-the-job training with some related&#13;
instruction, and cooperative-work training.&#13;
The type of training is described with some care when the payoff to vocational&#13;
training in developing countries is analysed. But for the remaining sections&#13;
the particular form of training is less important (for our purposes) - we&#13;
are concerned with gaining insights which are relevant whatever the type of&#13;
training.&#13;
In what follows, Part I presents evidence on three issues relevant to&#13;
the examination of vocational training. These issues are: the payoff to&#13;
vocational training in developing and industrial countries (Sections 2 and 3&#13;
respectively), substitutability (Section 4) and the methodology of firm-based&#13;
training studies (Section 5). Part II then builds on this partial survey to&#13;
draw some lessons and insights for evaluating the external efficiency of&#13;
vocational training using earnings data (Section 6) or output and related&#13;
data (Section 7).                                       1&#13;
1.2 Internal efficiency and external efficiency of training&#13;
The World Bank distinguishes between the internal efficiency of training&#13;
and the external efficiency. Some care is needed here because different&#13;
documents use these terms in slightly different ways. Consider the following&#13;
descriptions or definitions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Internal efficiency&#13;
" ... is used here in relation to how economically and successfully the&#13;
trainees are being processed through their training program to its completion"&#13;
(World Bank 1982 p.19).&#13;
"The evaluation of the training process ... can be measured by level of&#13;
enrollments, dropout rates, graduation rates, teacher/student ratios,&#13;
recurrent and capital costs per graduate, etc". (World Bank, no date,&#13;
paras. 4.1 and 4.2).&#13;
"The internal efficiency of an institution is a measure of its health in&#13;
terms of its internal operations. It covers, for example, the effectiveness&#13;
of its management; the relevance and content of its courses; the quality&#13;
of its teaching staff; the appropriateness of its equipment and its use;&#13;
the adequacy of accommodation and its utilisation. It also brings into&#13;
account questions of morale, motivation and staff and student relationships"&#13;
(Hunting, Zymelman and Godfrey 1984, p.27).&#13;
External efficiency&#13;
...  refers to the extent to which the trained persons proceed to jobs&#13;
relevant to their training and how well they perform in the light of their&#13;
training" (World Bank 1982, p.19).&#13;
"The evaluation of results or the impact of training on the production and&#13;
productivity of the utility ...   external efficiency could be measured (in&#13;
the power sector) through observation of changes in indicators such as&#13;
(a) production hours, (b) megawatts per worker, (c) gigawatt-hours of&#13;
generated power per worker, (d) maintenance, (e) safety, (f) system losses,&#13;
(g) staff turnover, (h) number of consumers/employees, (i) number of complaints,&#13;
(j) performance of graduates on the job" (World Bank, no date, paras. 4.1&#13;
and 4.2).&#13;
the external efficiency of the project (is evaluated) by comparing&#13;
costs and outcomes" (Hunting, Zymelman and Godfrey 1984, p.55).&#13;
There is general agreement that internal efficiency refers to the&#13;
training process - the identification, preparation and implementation of&#13;
the components of training. To the extent that it has an economic dimension,&#13;
the focus is on costs. The consequences of the training to the individual,&#13;
the firm or to society do not come into it.&#13;
There is less agreement on what constitues evaluation of the external&#13;
efficiency of training. The first description quoted is concerned with a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
narrow evaluation of training outcomes. Under this description costs&#13;
are ignored and the outcome is limited to the kinds of jobs done post training&#13;
and the performance of the trainees in these jobs. This omits many wider&#13;
considerations. For example, the trainee may raise output among his colleagues&#13;
or may move to another firm and raise output there. The second description&#13;
(taken from the Power Projects Guidelines) presents a very comprehensive menu&#13;
of measures of output, but an evaluation would also need to consider costs.&#13;
The third document defines external efficiency in terms of both costs and&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
The contents of this paper are addressed to the external efficiency of&#13;
training. It is not concerned with the way in which training "needs" are&#13;
identified nor with the process of training. Rather it focusses on costs&#13;
and outcomes, leading up to a discussion of how the external efficiency of&#13;
training can be evaluated. Thus it is orthogonal to the discussion of&#13;
evaluation of internal efficiency in World Bank (1982). The evaluation&#13;
method outlined in Part II is quantitative. However, there are also many&#13;
qualitative dimensions to the external efficiency of training. These are&#13;
well set out in the gestalt approach of Hunting, Zymelman and Godfrey&#13;
(1984, ch.3). But the bottom line of any such evaluation must, if possible,&#13;
be a cost-outcome indicator or a rate of return to training. So the&#13;
dimensions of any qualitative evaluation are ignored here in an attempt&#13;
to set out some of the issues when quantitative evaluations are required.&#13;
This paper is therefore complementary to that of Hunting, Zymelman and&#13;
Godfrey (1984).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
.No attempt is made here to set out a formal step-by-step method to&#13;
evaluate, for example, the external efficiency of the training component&#13;
in specific projects. (Both Stromsdorfer 1972 and Zymelman 1976 provide&#13;
comprehensive descriptions of evaluation methods and problems). Rather,&#13;
in Part I extant studies are analysed for the insights they provide and&#13;
in Part II various evaluation guidelines are suggested and scrutinised.&#13;
World Bank project related training "seeks to provide specialised&#13;
managerial, technical or operational skills pertaining to a particular&#13;
enterprise or sector. Training by enterprise is restricted to specified&#13;
jobs limited by the future scale of the enterprise and the number of&#13;
employees in only one occupational category during a fixed period of time.&#13;
Because the trainees are also employees, the problem of balancing supply&#13;
and demand does not arise. Further, there can be significant spillovers&#13;
of this training and experience into other activities" (World Bank 1980&#13;
p.47). In their comprehensive review the Operations Evaluation Department&#13;
recently described PRT as a "traditional and inhibiting view" of the&#13;
"training mandate" (World Bank 1982, para 18). The content of this paper&#13;
is relevant to any evaluation of the external efficiency of training which&#13;
aims to relate costs and outcomes. The analysis holds for sector wide&#13;
training (e.g. the power sector rather than a particular power plant) and&#13;
for vocational training projects such as those being undertaken currently&#13;
by the World Bank in the Philippines and in Indonesia (World Bank, August 198?&#13;
and March 1983 respectively).&#13;
1.3  Manpower requirements compared with rate of return analysis&#13;
This paper is addressed to the ex post evaluation of vocational&#13;
training.  As such it does not have to enter the controversy concerning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
the relative merits of the manpower requirements approach and the price&#13;
theory approach in the analysis of labour market skills (for an excellent&#13;
synthesis see Freeman 1977; see also Psacharopoulos et al. 1983 for a recent&#13;
examination of manpower planning). Nevertheless, it is worth briefly&#13;
discussing these concepts because this helps to focus the content of the&#13;
paper.&#13;
The manpower requirements approach projects manpower "needs" in any&#13;
period on the basis of the industrial composition of output and employment&#13;
and a fixed skill composition within industries. It deals exclusively with&#13;
quantitative data, typically at a highly disaggregate occupation or industry&#13;
level. The projected shortages (or surpluses) are identified by comparing&#13;
needs with expected supplies.&#13;
The price theory approach analyses both the demand and the supply side&#13;
of the labour market. On the demand side the key parameter is the elasticity&#13;
of substitution between more and less skilled workers or between capital and&#13;
labour. On the supply side, rates of return are calculated from earnings&#13;
and information on investment in human capital.&#13;
The manpower requirements and rate of return methods can both be used&#13;
to determine the desirable future structure of the labour force, and so&#13;
suggest manpower and training requirements. In this sense they deal with&#13;
one component of the efficiency of vocational training, namely the output&#13;
(quantity and quality of labour) of the training programme compared with&#13;
the ex ante indication of manpower needs (even when determining manpower&#13;
needs alternative indicators are available, such as vacancy rates and&#13;
chanqes in relative wages).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
However, this paper only addresses itself to the manpower needs question&#13;
in a tangential way, namely when it analyses substitution (Section 4). There&#13;
it is shown, first, that where a more labour intensive technology is more&#13;
efficient than existing technology the absolute number of skilled workers will&#13;
tend to rise, implying a big payoff to vocational training. It is an open&#13;
question whether production techniques on Bank projects are always appropriate.&#13;
It is possible, for example, that there is little flexibility in production&#13;
techniques in power and water supply but more flexibility in highway construction&#13;
or irrigation technique. A more labour-intensive technology tends to require&#13;
more unskilled and skilled workers. So if there is flexibility in the choice&#13;
of technique this interacts with the labour supply and, in turn, influences the&#13;
pattern of jobs "needed". Second, given the technology and output there is&#13;
evidence that skilled and less skilled workers are substitutable in the production&#13;
process. Similar evidence would be useful concerning World Bank projects.&#13;
Presumably such substitution possibilities are generally considered to be limited -&#13;
hence the need for vocational training. Putting the point differently: by what&#13;
process is it possible to document so clearly the jobs where training is needed?&#13;
The main thrust of this paper concerns ex post evaluation of the external&#13;
efficiency of vocational training (Sections 6 and 7). Here much of the&#13;
discussion is cast in rate of return terms - a simple way of bringing together&#13;
costs and benefits. This should not necessarily be taken to imply a preference&#13;
for the rate of return approach over the manpower requirements approach when&#13;
determining needs. It is simply that the manpower requirements approach,&#13;
while useful in the ex ante analysis of training, is not relevant to the&#13;
ex post analysis of costs and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.4 Summary&#13;
Vocational skills are important. The social rates of return to different&#13;
modes of vocational training (Table 2.9) are nearly always acceptably high.&#13;
Substitution in production to get the least cost input mix often implies the&#13;
need for more skilled labour (Section 4). It is not always possible to&#13;
substitute general education for vocational training when producing vocational&#13;
skills.  Therefore Section 2 examines the "where", "when" and "how long" of&#13;
vocational training.&#13;
It is possible to think of vocational training being located along a&#13;
continuum. At one extreme is secondary school-based training. Next comes&#13;
training in institutions like the vocational secondary schools in Israel or&#13;
the Indian Training Institutes. Then comes the South American type sandwich&#13;
training of the SENAI or SENATI variety. Finally there is firm-based training,&#13;
including World Bank project related training. It is not possible to generalise&#13;
about the returns to these different forms of training - there are always&#13;
exceptions to any general statement - but the weight of the evidence in Section&#13;
2 suggests that firm-based vocational training has a higher pay off than&#13;
vocational training which mainly takes place in schools.&#13;
When should vocational training occur? There is some evidence that, for&#13;
a given length and type of vocational training, there are diminishing returns&#13;
to formal schooling. This raises the question: should vocational schooling&#13;
come after primary or after secondary school? This issue is discussed in&#13;
Sections 2.5 and 2.6. The major part of the evidence suggests that the&#13;
returns to vocational training are lower for those who have taken secondary&#13;
schooling than those who entered vocational training after primary school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
Finally, the duration of vocational training is important. In general&#13;
the evidence in Section 2 indicates - for Israel and Peru for example -&#13;
that short courses of vocational training have higher returns than longer&#13;
courses.&#13;
Industrialised countries use resources equivalent to around 3 per cent&#13;
of GDP on training. There are a large number of evaluations of training in&#13;
such countries, particularly that provided or financed publicly. Some&#13;
recent evidence is discussed in Section 3. It is shown that the private&#13;
labour market may fail to provide an efficient supply of trained labour&#13;
because of poaching, borrowing difficulties for trainees or because trainees&#13;
wages are set too high. This provides a reason for public intervention in&#13;
the training effort. In addition public provision of training is sometimes&#13;
justified on equity grounds, to improve the lifetime chances of those towards&#13;
the bottom of the occupational hierarchy. Most evaluations use information&#13;
on earnings to get at the costs and benefits of training. Evidence suggests&#13;
that the best such evaluations have data on both trainees and a control group&#13;
of non-trainees and on earnin-gs before and after training.&#13;
Substitutability is discussed in Section 4. The evidence presented is&#13;
not relevant to any immediate evaluation of vocational training in a particular&#13;
plant. Rather it is relevant at one remove: care should be taken both with&#13;
the choice of technology and with the mix of labour employed to produce a&#13;
given output from given equipment. Two points stand out. First, in some&#13;
sectors a more labour-intens;ive method of production is economically more&#13;
efficient than current methods. This may, in turn, imply the need for more,&#13;
not less, skilled labour and vocational training. Second, if the technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
and output are taken as given the bulk of studies show that more and less&#13;
skilled labour are substitutes, rather than complements in the production&#13;
process. It would be illuminating to know if this is also true in the&#13;
particular plants where training associated with Bank projects takes place.&#13;
Firm-level (Section 5) training studies are quite rare, but the&#13;
economic analysis they contain is, in general, outstanding. Much World&#13;
Bank training is also firm-related training so these firm studies provide&#13;
particularly helpful guidance. On the cost side it is clear that the costs&#13;
of informal training are difficult to get at, while foregone earnings and&#13;
the resources devoted by the firm to formal training are more easily estimated.&#13;
But it is on the benefits side that the real insights are gained. First,&#13;
sophisticated production functions are unlikely to be able to pick up any&#13;
relationship between trained labour and output at the level of the firm.&#13;
Second, performance ratings are a sensible and useful method of measuring&#13;
(individual) productivity and would be helpful in cost effectiveness studies&#13;
of World Bank training expenditure. Third, downtime is a potentially valuable&#13;
intermediate measure of output. Fourth, and most important, pay may well be&#13;
an imperfect indicator of value product, in particular pay rises with experience&#13;
but productivity may not. Therefore if we use pay to measure the value of&#13;
output a cost-benefit framework may not always give correct results.&#13;
It is noteworthy that firm-level studies typically concentrate on either&#13;
costs or outcomes but do not analyse both simultaneously in the form of cost-&#13;
benefit analysis. (By contrast, rate of return studies abound for public&#13;
training programmes). There are a number of reasons why there are few rate&#13;
of return studies to corporate training. First, training is not usually a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
separate entity which must show a profit. Second, it is difficult to dis-&#13;
aggregate training from other things that go on inside a company - training&#13;
is part of a whole bundle of things that go on together. Third, it is very&#13;
difficult to test for the notion of specific training, where training is only&#13;
useful in the firm providing it. Firm specific training is tied up with&#13;
implicit contracts and monopsony power. Much firm-level training (either on-&#13;
the-job or off-the-job in the firm or in institutions) is concerned with&#13;
encouraging loyalty and the promotion of an internal labour market. It is&#13;
plausible that such company training is simply not testable in standard cost-&#13;
benefit terms. In particular, is it really possible to estimate the wedge&#13;
between value product and pay?&#13;
Despite such problems Part II concerns methods to evaluate the external&#13;
efficiency of vocational training. In Section 6 we discuss how to evaluate&#13;
such training using earnings data and the problems which occur. This section&#13;
draws, in particular, on the illumination provided by the firm-based studies&#13;
and the extensive literature on the evaluation of public manpower and training&#13;
programmes. Methods and objectives are discussed first. Then various&#13;
technical problems are elaborated, including:    sample size, control groups,&#13;
the use of longitudinal data and problems caused by labour mobility. Finally&#13;
the relationship between earnings and value product is extensively analysed.&#13;
In general non-competitive labour markets, externalities and disequilibrium&#13;
drive a wedge between earnings and the true worth of the individual to the&#13;
firm so great care must be taken when evaluating the corporate and social&#13;
rate of return to vocational training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
Section 7 discusses cost-effective and cost-benefit analyses of&#13;
vocational training using output and input data. A number of promising&#13;
output and input measures exist. For example a before/after study could&#13;
be based on the output of particular individuals and use piece-work&#13;
earnings, performance rating or quit propensity as the indicator of&#13;
output. Or training might be analysed at the plant level using plant&#13;
downtime or the value of production as the output measures or reductions&#13;
in labour and other factors as the input measure associated with training.&#13;

VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN DEVELOPING AND INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES,&#13;
SUBSTITUTION AND FIRM BASED STUDIES-&#13;
SECTION 2&#13;
The Payoff to Vocational Training in Developing Countries:&#13;
A Review of the Evidence&#13;
2.1 Introduction&#13;
A limited number of studies have examined the rate of return to vocational&#13;
training in developing countries. A number of overlapping but different themes&#13;
are apparent in the partial survey which follows. These include:&#13;
- the case for expansion of the system of vocational training or&#13;
particular parts of that system,&#13;
- the internal efficiency or cost effectiveness of the system, for&#13;
example between different types of courses or different length courses,&#13;
- comparisons of the payoff to on the job training and off the job&#13;
training, though "on" and "off" need careful definition,&#13;
- the substitutability between vocational training and formal schooling,&#13;
- the vocational school fallacy.&#13;
These themes will be examined one at a time below.&#13;
The studies run up against many technical problems of evaluation, particularly,&#13;
on the benefits side. These problems include:&#13;
- the type of control group: full longitudinal data are helpful because&#13;
we are then dealing with the same individuals before and after training.&#13;
Where we only have cross section data the control variables may be&#13;
crucial,&#13;
- the measurement of earnings is important on both the cost and benefit&#13;
side, for example: do earnings reflect productivity, what do we do&#13;
about intangibles, is the labour market in equilibrium, what is the&#13;
shadow price of labour?&#13;
-  mobility of individuals among firms, occupations and countries influences&#13;
the various rate of return calculations to individuals, firms and society,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
- is it possible for a firm to drive a wedge between pay and productivity&#13;
for long periods? This is particularly important in calculating the&#13;
rate of return for the firm,&#13;
- the need to correct cost and benefit figures for drop-outs,&#13;
- the extent to which wider labour market analysis - of vacancy rates&#13;
and earnings changes for example - is useful to supplement the rate of&#13;
return analysis.&#13;
Such methodological problems will only be briefly examined here, but they are&#13;
more fully discussed in Part II.&#13;
To set the scene the results of the various studies are summarised in&#13;
Tables 2.1 and 2.2. In Malaysia Cohen (1983) examined three types of training -&#13;
two year basic, job entry training for new recruits and apprenticeships -&#13;
which all apparently yield a high rate of return, of the order of 20 per cent.&#13;
Borus (1977) was particuarly interested in the cost effectiveness of four&#13;
different modes of vocational training in Israel. He concluded that the&#13;
different modes yield the same earnings even though they have very different&#13;
costs. In particular he questioned the cost effectiveness of formal vocational&#13;
secondary schools. However, his results have been qualified somewhat by Levine&#13;
(1979).&#13;
Two studies which do not measure productivity by earnings are those of&#13;
Fuller (1976) and Godfrey (1977). Fuller finds that productivity in his Indian&#13;
case study firm is raised more by in-firm training than by pre-employment&#13;
vocational training institutes. His study is unusual because productivity is&#13;
measured by a cardinal scale of worker efficiency ratings. In a rare study&#13;
relating to Africa Godfrey (1977) examines whether the likelihood of passing&#13;
a government trade test (at three different levels) of craft skills is related&#13;
to institutional training, after controlling for schooling and age. He finds&#13;

those with some full time institutional training have lower pass-rates than&#13;
those with no such training.   Both these studies cast doubt on the payoff&#13;
to institutional vocational training even though they do not calculate social&#13;
or private rates of return.&#13;
The payoff to vocational training in South America is summarised in&#13;
Table 2.2. The systems in the countries described in the table seem quite&#13;
similar. The training organisatlons are semi-autonomous. They are financed&#13;
by a payroll tax on private firms above a certain size and on all public&#13;
organisations. The system is separate from the formal education system and&#13;
consists mainly of vocational schools or in-plant but off the job training.&#13;
The ILO provides technical assistance.&#13;
In Brazil postgraduate SENAI training yields a minimum social rate of&#13;
return of 12 per cent (Castro, 1979). One of the earliest internal World Bank&#13;
rate of return studies showed a social rate of return to the INACAP training&#13;
system in Chile as high as 50 per cent, but various qualifications by&#13;
Arriazazzi (1972) cut that exceptionally high figure by over half to some&#13;
20 per cent. For Colombia Puryear (1979) shows that individuals who have&#13;
taken a three year SENA apprenticeship earn, on average, nearly half as much&#13;
again as similar individuals who have not been exposed to SENA, and the SENA-&#13;
effect is bigger for those with less formal education than those with more&#13;
eduation. These studies of training in Brazil, Chile and Colombia all show a&#13;
rather high payoff to vocational training, but the opposite conclusion was&#13;
reached by Psacharopoulos (1982) in the analysis of SENATI training in Peru.&#13;
There were no data to calculate a rate of return, therefore the author&#13;
inverted the problem and calculated the pay differential trainees would&#13;

require to generate a 10 per cent social return. Individuals trained under&#13;
two year apprenticeships would require, post training, a positive differential&#13;
over 70 per cent above the minimum wage and the study questions whether this&#13;
would be forthcoming, although it is more sanguine about the prospects for&#13;
shorter courses.&#13;
2.2 The case for expansion of vocational traininq&#13;
The World Bank has undertaken studies designed to see whether the whole&#13;
system of vocational training should be expanded in a particular country and&#13;
whether particular components should be expanded faster than others.&#13;
Twenty years ago a lucid Bank study (Picciotto 1965) examined the case&#13;
for large-scale expansion of vocational training to be undertaken by the&#13;
National Training Institute (INACAP) in Chile. The project concerned three&#13;
specific INACAP programmes (Arriagazzi, 1972):&#13;
- Basic training courses to upgrade unskilled into semi-skilled workers.&#13;
These full-time courses lasted three to six months and covered a&#13;
variety of trades. They were designed especially for: youngsters&#13;
who had reached a prescribed minimum of general education but with no&#13;
technical training, unemployed people, employed workers wishing to&#13;
change jobs or to migrate to another area.&#13;
- Further training courses to upgrade semi-skilled workers to skilled&#13;
status. These evening courses, lasting from ten to twenty weeks&#13;
covered a variety of trades and were intended mainly for experienced&#13;
workers with daytime jobs.&#13;
- Specialisation courses to provide experienced skilled workers with more&#13;
advanced special skills. These evening courses lasted from five to&#13;
fifteen weeks.&#13;
In 1965 some 12,000 trainees had completed these INACAP programmes. The proposed&#13;
target was to expand the annual output of the three programmes by an additional&#13;
14,000 trainees.    The Bank estimated the project costs - capital, current, ILO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
technical assistance and students' foregone earnings. Benefits were defined&#13;
as the total extra gross earnings the 14,000 trainees could expect to receive&#13;
on completion of their period of training adjusted downwards, in aggregate,&#13;
arbitrarily by one third to allow for the fact that a fraction of the employees&#13;
might, in time, have acquired equal proficiency simply with experience. The&#13;
internal rate of return on the project was put at .50 per cent, providing "ample&#13;
economic justification for undertaking the project". (p.4). The costs and&#13;
benefits of this project were re-calculated by Arriagazzi (1972). The revised&#13;
costs changed little but more conservative figures were used for benefits.&#13;
The 1965 study had assumed that:&#13;
- all trainees would complete their course,&#13;
- all trainees would get promoted accordingly,&#13;
-  following training, individuals would be fully employed for twenty years,&#13;
-  each worker's increased earnings would begin as soon as the second year&#13;
after his training,&#13;
- the present value of earnings should be reduced by one sixth to allow&#13;
for a reduction in the work week from six to five days,&#13;
- the present value of earnings should also be reduced by one sixth to&#13;
allow for the fact that some trained workers would eventually acquire&#13;
similar skills via experience.&#13;
More realistic assumptions cut the social rate of return to around 20 per cent,&#13;
still "strikingly high" (p.358).&#13;
The economic justification of expanding vocational training facilities in&#13;
Peru has recently been analysed by Psacharopoulos (1982). SENATI is the national&#13;
centre for industrial training, financed by a 1.5 per cent payroll levy of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
firms employing more than 15 employees. Essentially it runs two types of&#13;
programmes:&#13;
- long term apprenticeships (about two years duration) offered to youths&#13;
with secondary school background via full-time SENATI based instruction&#13;
- short term upgrading courses (of a few weeks duration) offered to adult&#13;
employed workers by means of a visiting instructor in the firms.&#13;
No full data on earnings of SENATI graduates and others exist and so rate of&#13;
return calculations were not possible. Therefore the problem was inverted&#13;
and the earnings differential due to SENATI training required to produce a&#13;
social rate of return of 10 per cent was estimated. The earnings differential&#13;
is arrived at by solving the short cut rate of return formula for the numerator&#13;
of the expression:&#13;
Required earnings differential          T     .10&#13;
Training cost (= unit cost plus foregone earnings)&#13;
The results are given in Table 2.3. As the study remarks, there is a "dramatic&#13;
difference ... between apprenticeship and other programmes offered by SENATI.&#13;
Productivity differentials equivalent to 0.3 to 5.0 per cent of the minimum&#13;
wage rate can be reasonably assumed to exist for short term programmes like&#13;
In-Service Upgrading and Training within Industry. The 50,353 sales monthly&#13;
differential associated with apprenticeship is rather unlikely to exist in&#13;
practice". Therefore the study, conservatively, recommends that in any&#13;
expansion of the SENATI system priority should be given to the shorter courses.&#13;
The World Bank has recently also examined the cost for expanded in-service&#13;
industrial training in Malaysia (Cohen 1983). Malaysia lags significantly&#13;
behind other major Asian countries in terms of technical/vocational school&#13;

enrollment as a percentage of total school enrollment (Malaysia - 11 per cent,&#13;
Republic of Korea - 50 per cent, Thailand - 26 per cent). The study indicates&#13;
that "rapid industrialisation over the past decade has not been matched by the&#13;
necessary restructuring of the education system to increase emphasis on&#13;
technical and vocational training. The shortfall in this type of training&#13;
may, however, be too large to be resolved solely by the expansion of&#13;
institutional training. Although institutional training is indispensable&#13;
in the longer run, training by industry will have to play a greater role in&#13;
reducing the imbalance in the short term" (p.1).&#13;
The sample was drawn from ten companies, ranging in size from 340 to&#13;
4,300 workers. About 17 per cent of the total workers in the ten companies&#13;
were undergoing various types of training. Of these about 96 per cent were&#13;
enrolled in in-house training and the remainder in out-of-house training.&#13;
There are four types of training:&#13;
- basic training for new recruits for about two years partly on the&#13;
job and partly off the job, equivalent to apprenticeship training,&#13;
- job entry training for new recruits on probation for a shorter period,&#13;
usually six months,&#13;
- refresher courses for the company personnel lasting from a few days&#13;
to a few weeks. Pay is not affected,&#13;
- upgrading courses for company personnel for a few weeks, partly on&#13;
and off the job. On completion their salary is rescaled.&#13;
The study concentrates on the first two types of training and it also presents&#13;
'comparisons of the payoff to on-the-job and off-the-job training.&#13;
Returns to the individual, the firm and society from basic skill training&#13;
are given in Table 2.4. The relevant formulae for calculating the rates&#13;
of return are discussed in Section 5. The private and social returns&#13;

are well known. The rate of return to the firm is a less widely used notion.&#13;
The costs to the firm are: cost of training plus earnings of trainee minus&#13;
the productive value of the trainee. The benefits to the firm are: the&#13;
productive value of the worker minus the earnings paid to the worker, all&#13;
multiplied by the retention rate of trained workers. The rates of return set&#13;
out in Table 2.4 suggest that this is an attractive investment from each of&#13;
the three different perspectives. Likewise, the rate of return to the firm&#13;
from job entry training averages 46 per cent. However, these results should&#13;
be treated cautiously. A before/after methodology was used. Although this&#13;
is ingenious it is also worrying because the study simply constructs the&#13;
required longitudinal data. In particular, it assumes that the productive&#13;
value of the worker post training is equivalent to the average earnings of a&#13;
trained worker but that actual earnings are below average earnings for twenty&#13;
years post training. This "automatically" produces a high rate of return to&#13;
the firm and to society. This problem is discussed further below (Section 6)&#13;
but it is worth remarking here that it is not clear how the firm is able to&#13;
pay the trained worker below his true worth for as long as twenty years.&#13;
For apprenticeship training the study is able to estimate and compare&#13;
returns to institutional training (IT) and firm training (FT). The main&#13;
differences between them are:&#13;
- the firm gives a premium of 12 per cent higher pay to an IT trained&#13;
apprentice, largely attributable to his additional productive capability&#13;
over company workers,&#13;
- the retention rate of IT graduates is 10 per cent below FT workers,&#13;
- the production during training is lower among trainees from IT than&#13;
among company trainees, by about 25 per cent,&#13;
- the training costs of IT are higher than those of FT. The average unit&#13;
cost for IT is M$ 7,570, compared to M$ 5,200 for the cost of FT.-&#13;

The economic return is again very high, suggesting the proposed e.xpansion of&#13;
vocational training is sensible.   The payo,f to the firm is hiÂ§hzr from&#13;
recruiting an IT worker than from undertakTng its own tralnin`g.   This is&#13;
because the firm does not bear the cost of IT and hints that a `evy/grant&#13;
system might help equalise the FT and fT returns to the firm,&#13;
2.3 Cost effectiveness of vocational training&#13;
Vocational secondary school programmes are costly, therefo-- we must ask&#13;
"Does vocational schooling result in sufficiently superior job performance&#13;
and earnings to justify the extra cost?" (Staley, 1971).    Studies which&#13;
confront this cost-effectiveness question include those ?or Israie (Borus,&#13;
1977) and India (Fuller, 1976). The economic returns in the early 1970s&#13;
associated with the costs of four different 'cypes of vocational training in&#13;
Israel - vocational secondary schools, industrial schools, apprcnticeships&#13;
and short courses - are examined. The results of Borus' study have been&#13;
scrutinised by Levine (1979). The vocational programmes in Xsrael were&#13;
described by Borus as fQllQws in l&amp;72-3:&#13;
Apprenticeships&#13;
The apprenticeship programme had 8,600 onroliees.    The majoricty were&#13;
for three years.   Typically apprentiens came from low socio-econom4Ic&#13;
backgrounds.   The apprentices work five days a week with employers providing&#13;
on-the-job training and they attend school one day a week to learn the theory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
of their trade.  Apprentices were examined at the end of each year and had&#13;
to pass an examination before receiving Ministry of Labour certification&#13;
necessary to work in their trade.&#13;
Industrial schools&#13;
Some 1,800 students attended about thirty industrial schools in 1972-73.&#13;
These schools, operated in co-operation with and at the site of large&#13;
employers of skilled labour, combined regular vocational secondary school&#13;
training with in-plant training. The courses typically last three years.&#13;
At the end of their training the students were examined and certified in&#13;
their trades by the Ministry of Labour.&#13;
Ministry of Labour "short" courses for youth&#13;
Some 2,100 16- and 17-year olds participated in short courses sponsored&#13;
by the Ministry of Labour. Many of these were preludes to further training&#13;
or work within the Army and usually lasted for one year. Most of the time&#13;
was devoted to providing practical experience in the trade. At the end of&#13;
their courses the students were tested and certified in their trades by the&#13;
Ministry of Labour.&#13;
Vocational secondary schools&#13;
Some 70,000 students, or 50 per cent of secondary school students,&#13;
attended vocational secondary schools. These schools were highly selective,&#13;
admitting only the better primary school students. Approximately half the&#13;
week was devoted to general studies and half to practical training in&#13;
vocational subjects.&#13;
The data for the study refer to the 1969 and 1970 earnings of 530&#13;
individuals born in 1947 who were trained in one of the three occupations -&#13;
automobile mechanics, electrician trades, metal working trades. Earnings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
were regressed on type of vocational training, sector and immigrant status.&#13;
Some results are given in Table 2.5.   There are no significant differences&#13;
in earnings among the four training modes or, as Borus puts it "the different&#13;
modes of training yielded approximately equal products" (p.9). However the&#13;
training costs are very different. Table 2.6 indicates that the cost per&#13;
student is five times higher for Industrial Schools and Short Courses than&#13;
for Apprenticeships and that Vocational Secondary Schools are nine times as&#13;
costly as Apprenticeships.&#13;
These findings suggest that, focussing on skills training, the formal&#13;
vocational secondary schools, are much less cost effective than other methods&#13;
of training skilled and semi-skilled workers, particularly apprenticeships.&#13;
However, Levine (1979) suggests that these results must be qualified. He&#13;
points out that, in general, individuals with the most years of formal&#13;
education also undertake more on the job training than other workers. Borus&#13;
is observing earnings only a few years after one or other of the training&#13;
modes. Thus, while the earnings for the 1947 cohort from the four training&#13;
modes are not significantly different from one another in 1969 or 1970 the&#13;
present values could be different if we had more complete data on longitudinal&#13;
earnings, because those going to vocational secondary schools may have steeper&#13;
age-earnings profiles. Levine re-works Borus' data using plausible&#13;
assumptions about (i) the fraction of potential earnings invested in each&#13;
period, and (ii) the return on that investment. In turn, this permits a rate&#13;
of return calculation to the extra investment in vocational secondary schools&#13;
over and above the other training modes. The results are given in Table 2.7.&#13;
It seems clear that the payoff to the extra resources devoted to vocational&#13;

secondary schools over apprenticeships is not worthwhile for individuals&#13;
or for society (from the perspective of skill-training) but it just might&#13;
be as compared with the Industrial School and Short Course mode.&#13;
Recently Ziderman (nd) has up-dated the work of Borus and Levine using&#13;
individual earnings data for the 7-year period 1969-75 for two samples.&#13;
One sample consisted of some 300 graduates of Ministry of Labour vocational&#13;
courses for adults, and the other of 1,500 skilled workers who received their&#13;
training as teenagers either at vocational secondary schools or at industrial&#13;
schools, short annual teenager courses or apprenticeships. The samples were&#13;
standardised by age, location and background data on the individuals.&#13;
Ziderman found no significant differences in the earnings of graduates of&#13;
the four types of courses. This confirms the earlier results of Borus&#13;
relating to a much shorter post-training earnings follow-up. They also&#13;
confirm the Borus-Levine results that the expensive vocational secondary&#13;
schools offer no earnings advantage, even in the longer term, over cheaper&#13;
job-related training programmes. Ziderman concludes "Here it would seem is&#13;
yet a further instance of the vocational schooling fallacy" (p.135). Ziderman&#13;
also found that workers undergoing training in their early and mid twenties&#13;
may expect a higher lifetime earnings profile than teenage trainees, a result&#13;
of the benefits stemming from the continuity of study and work experience&#13;
uninterrupted by army service and also a reflection of the better career&#13;
choices made at a more mature age.&#13;
Fuller (1976) studies the cost-effectiveness of different types of&#13;
vocational training in one large plant in southern India. His productivity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
measure was the job performance, as assessed by their supervisors, of 474&#13;
millers, turners and grinders. The advantage of using cfficicncy rating&#13;
is that "they are related specifically to a worker's individual output&#13;
(quality and quantity) and already take into account extraneous factors&#13;
affecting worker performance such as machine capacity, fDow of !materials&#13;
from co-workers, ease of access to tools and instruments, and hardness of&#13;
raw materials" (p.31).&#13;
There were three mutually exclusive training paths:&#13;
Â°  Industrial Training Xnstitutes (ITX), an sighteen month government&#13;
sponsored vocational programme for boys with some secondary&#13;
schooling, sometimes followed by one year pro-employment apprentice7&#13;
ship training (n = 214),&#13;
Â°  In-Firm Training (WFT), any organised training program.e operated&#13;
within the company for empNoyed workers (n - 22Y),&#13;
Â°  Picking Up Trade (PUT), where unskilled workers acquire job know.&#13;
how by imitations, co-workers and supervisors (n    33)o&#13;
Control variables included schooling, experience , caste, religion and job&#13;
satisfaction.  The benefits and costs of the three types of vocational&#13;
training are given in Table 2.8.   For the who,e sample job pertormance is&#13;
around ten per cent higher among those formally or informally trained lln-&#13;
plant than in the Industrial Training Xnstitutens   Yet the costs of&#13;
institutional training are much highcr. Cinarly, in the case of this&#13;
particular firm at least, the Industrial T'rainIng Institutes are not cost&#13;
effective.&#13;

2.4  Social rate of return to different modes of vocational   _ra,7n &#13;
Naturally it is interesting to widen the cost-ceffectiveness q&gt;3ustion&#13;
and to enquire whether a particular mode of vocational training has a&#13;
consistently higher payoff than another mode. Some such comparisons are&#13;
presented, tentatively, in Table 2.9.   Most of the studies surveyed are&#13;
surprisingly vague on the precise nature of the vocational trainung they&#13;
are analysing, therefore the classification is speculative.    The table&#13;
suggests the following points.&#13;
First, of the thirteen country/mode cel'ls in the tab'e nine seem to have&#13;
acceptably high social rates of return.    The exceptions are:   (i ) SEAATXL&#13;
apprenticeships in Peru;   (ii) Vocational Secondary Schools in Xsrael 1f they&#13;
were to yield only the minimum rate of return; (iii) Yndustria Tra'tning&#13;
Institutes in India, and   (iv) Full time institutional craft trLining in&#13;
Kenya.&#13;
Second, on the costs side, when we compare disfferent modes of training&#13;
inside a given country the social rate of return is higher whcrv., tra,ning&#13;
expenditures are low and where foregone earnings are small or zero.&#13;
(Although this is not surprising it need not be so).    For example. in Israel&#13;
in-plant apprenticeship training has a higher payoff than formaw vocational&#13;
secondary school training. An in Brazil and Peru short in-plan;+ training&#13;
has a largersocial rate of return than institutional training Cone through&#13;
SENAI and INACAP (though we should, presumably, treat some of the Brazilian&#13;
estimates of rate of return to in-plant training rather cautiously). In&#13;
India the Industrial Training Institutes have substantially hig,her costs,&#13;
and a lower impact on productivity, than in-firm training.    Suci cost&#13;
differentials bring out the importance of the internal efficiency of traiming.&#13;

In Kenya government trade tests are conductcd in many craft trades,&#13;
including engineering, woodwork, builiding  electrica'i trades, ta'W]or'ing&#13;
trades.  There are three grades of trade test.   It is possible tbo prepare&#13;
for the test by attending a full time course a't a traWnThg insttution.   In&#13;
Godfrey's analysis of the pass/fai' rates In these tests 141 out of 446&#13;
candidates had attended such a full time course, at institutions ranging&#13;
from village polytechnics and youth centres at one extreme to the Kenya&#13;
Polytechnic at the other.  After controlling for schooling and age those&#13;
who have followed such institutional vocational training are significantly&#13;
less likely to pass the trade test than those without training: those&#13;
taking the (easiest) Grade III test are 14 per cent Sess iikely to pass and&#13;
those sitting the (hardest) Grade X test are 25 per cent less !`.tely to&#13;
pass. This raises serious doubts about the social rate of return to such&#13;
institutional training in Kenya.&#13;
Third, one country where explicit compar'sons of different modes of&#13;
training were made was Malaysia.   Apprenticeship training via a mixture of&#13;
on-the-job training and classroom training has a somewhat higher social&#13;
return than purely institutional apprenticeship training.&#13;
Last, but not least, wherever comparisons are possible wiihin a country&#13;
we note that institutional vocational training always has a lowQr payoff&#13;
than training done wholly or partly inside tho firm, whother on or off the&#13;
job.&#13;

2.5 Relationship between formal schooling and vocational training&#13;
Two of the studies of vocational training in South America have examined&#13;
the relationship between formal schooling and vocational training. Puryear&#13;
(1979) estimated the payoff to three year SENA apprenticeships in Colombia.&#13;
His sample consisted of all males who had graduated from the SENA industrial&#13;
apprenticeship programme in Bogota between 1965 and 1967 and, essentially, a&#13;
control group of Bogota men similar to the SENA apprentices in age and formal&#13;
education. He regressed the hourly earnings of his sample in 1972 (i.e. five&#13;
to seven years after training) on: whether a SENA graduate, years of formal&#13;
schooling (squared), years of work experience, firm size, father's socio-&#13;
economic status. SENA graduates earn, over the sample as a whole, 48 per&#13;
cent more than equivalent non-SENA graduates, but this "SENA effect" is&#13;
smaller for those with more than six years education. Those with only&#13;
primary school education gain 76 per cent in hourly earnings if they are a&#13;
SENA graduate, while those with ten or eleven years formal education gain only&#13;
33 per cent (Table 2.10). Puryear notes that this implies SENA can substitute&#13;
for formal education. We can make this more concrete as follows. The&#13;
coefficient on years of formal schooling (squared) is 0.005, therefore SENA&#13;
graduates with eleven years formal education get only 5 per cent more&#13;
earnings than those with five years.:&#13;

Such a result confirms Puryear's observation that SENA can substitute for&#13;
extra years of formal education.&#13;
In his analysis of SENAI vocational education in Brazil, Castro (1979)&#13;
comes to a rather similar conclusion. He calculated rates of return for&#13;
manual workers with various combinations of education and training in the&#13;
manufacturing sector in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The results for Sao&#13;
Paulo are reported in Table 2.11. The social rate of return to the SENAI&#13;
programme is higher (24 per cent on average) for those with only primary&#13;
education than those with junior high school education (12 per cent on&#13;
average). Likewise the social return in both Rio de Janeiro and in Sao&#13;
Paulo to those going on to four years of junior high school after primary&#13;
is only half that (12 per cent) of those who instead go on to the SENAI&#13;
programme (24 per cent).&#13;
Formal education and vocational training each separately add to earnings&#13;
in Brazil and Colombia. The social returns to extra formal education appear&#13;
high in both countries: the return to high school in Brazil is twice the&#13;
return to junior high school, and in Colombia years of education are associated&#13;
with earnings not linearly but quadratically. However, for our purposes the&#13;
dominant result is the very high payoff to quasi-institutional vocational&#13;
training for those who have only completed primary school, which suggests&#13;
that such vocational training may be substitutable for extra formal schooling.&#13;
Fuller's (1976) case study from India also distinguishes various&#13;
combinations of schooling and training. Irrespective of schooling level workers&#13;
formally trained in-firm perform better than those trained in the vocational&#13;
institute. For those who picked up the trade informally the productivity&#13;

effect, relative to institutional training, only occurs for those with high&#13;
levels of schooling suggesting extra schooling may be a pre-requisite for&#13;
on-the-job training.&#13;
2.6 The "vocational school fallacy"&#13;
The studies discussed above provide some evidence on the so-&#13;
called "vocational school fallacy" Foster, 1966). Different authors&#13;
interpret this fallacy in different ways. One strand is to examine the&#13;
returns to vocational training in institutions as compared with that on or&#13;
off the job in firms. Another concerns the relative merits of vocational&#13;
training in institutions compared with longer academic schooling coupled&#13;
with on-the-job training.&#13;
In South America the returns to the various institutional training&#13;
agencies in Chile, Colombia and Brazil suggest that the vocational schools&#13;
there are cost effective particularly for those with relatively low levels&#13;
of formal primary and/or secondary schooling. Thus Castro describes the&#13;
SENAI system in Brazil as "one of the most successful experiments in the&#13;
history of Brazilian education" (p.618) which "revealed outstanding results&#13;
for vocational education, as compared with academic education plus on-the-job&#13;
training" (p.622). Such a strong view may need to be questioned in the light&#13;
of evidence presented by Miller and Zaidi (1981). They studied the factors&#13;
associated with earnings in multinational companies in Brazil and Mexico in&#13;
the auto and retail sectors (n = 1137). There was no evidence that current&#13;
earnings were associated with formal training either in previous jobs or in&#13;
current job. By contrast earnings were associated with years of education&#13;
and current job tenure, which they interpreted as a payoff to on the job&#13;
training. Possibly multinationals insist on a mode of vocational training&#13;
different to that supplied by SENAI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The studies relating to India, Israel and Kenya all tend to support the&#13;
vocational school fallacy. In Israel formal Vocational Secondary Schools&#13;
have higher costs than other modes of vocational training and may not yield&#13;
correspondingly higher earnings.   Levine suggests that the Vocational Secondary&#13;
Schools may just about yield a tolerable social rate of return over Industrial&#13;
Schools and Short Courses but his figures confirm that apprenticeships are the&#13;
most cost effective training device. Likewise in India the Industrial Training&#13;
Institutes have higher costs and a lower productivity-raising effect than&#13;
formal or informal in-firm training. Further the productivity effect of&#13;
informal training is highest for those with the most education (though whether&#13;
it is sufficiently high to justify the extra schooling cannot be calculated&#13;
from Fuller's data).   And in Kenya Godfrey concludes thus:   " ... the fact&#13;
that those who have undergone full-time training courses do worse at all grades&#13;
of test than those who have not suggests at least that the efficacy of such&#13;
courses and of the institutions which house them needs to be carefully&#13;
examined" (p.35).&#13;
In the most thorough study so far Psacharopoulos and Loxley (1984)&#13;
contrast the educational and labour market attainments of graduates from&#13;
academic and vocational schools and schools with different biases in&#13;
Colombia and Tanzania. Costs and outcomes are related in order to get at&#13;
the external efficiency of the respective schools. Outcomes include learning&#13;
achievement, ability among secondary school leavers to achieve further&#13;
education and training, and ultimately to perform in the labour market. The&#13;
primary explicit rationale for diversified secondary schooling and the&#13;
introduction of vocational or pre-vocational studies, such as industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-&#13;
arts or agriculture, has been to increase the economic relevance of schooling.&#13;
Therefore it is labour market achievement, rather than increases in learning&#13;
achievement or changes in attitudes, which is the most important outcome.&#13;
The evidence of this outcome is tentative because not all the sample of&#13;
secondary school leavers surveyed had entered the labour market by the time&#13;
of the survey. A number of hypotheses were examined. For example it was&#13;
suggested that diversification (i.e. vocational as well as academic schooling)&#13;
leads to:&#13;
- less private demand for post-secondary school&#13;
- a closer relationship between school bias and specialisation of&#13;
post-school training&#13;
- a higher propensity for labour force participation at the end of&#13;
secondary schooling&#13;
- employment in the field of pre-vocational specialisation&#13;
- shorter periods of unemployment (job search) following secondary&#13;
school graduation, and&#13;
- higher graduate earnings&#13;
In general, the evidence does not support these hypotheses. In particular,&#13;
in Colombia there is no statistically significant difference, other things&#13;
equal, between mean earnings of those on the two different track and in&#13;
Tanzania the "first indications do not corroborate the hypothesis that the&#13;
introduction of pre-vocational studies into secondary schooling can be&#13;
justified on the basis of the economic payoff being greater than for academic&#13;
schooling" (p.7-30). The preliminary results of this thorough study therefore&#13;
also support the vocational school fallacy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

207 Summary&#13;
It is difficult to generalise on the basi,s of the studies examined in&#13;
this section because there is no guarantee that the resuits wou.d be&#13;
replicated over time or across coun.tries.   NMevertheless, some tcnntative&#13;
conclusions are possible.   First, where the rationale for the s*;udy was to&#13;
see i,' any expansion in training facilities was custifled the rcte o'F return&#13;
was typically high enough to justify such an expansion. Second, there is&#13;
some evidence that in Brazil and Peru short courses have a bigger payoff&#13;
than longer courses of training. Third, training in Industrial institutes&#13;
and vocational secondary schools is less cost effective than more informal&#13;
firm-based training, at least in Kenya, India and Xsraeil Vourt;.h, the payoff&#13;
to quasi-institutional vocational training in South America is 'gher for&#13;
those who have only completed primary school than for those who have completed&#13;
secondary school. This suggests that extra forn!ai schooling may be substitut'&#13;
able for formal institutional vocational training.&#13;

SECTION 3&#13;
Public training programmes in industrial countries&#13;
Most governments provide funds for public provision of training places.&#13;
In addition they often intervene in an attempt to improve the way the&#13;
private training market works. In this section we examine some such&#13;
government activities in Britain and the US in order to provide insights&#13;
into training evaluation problems in developing countries.&#13;
Most recent evaluation work in the US has concerned the private gains&#13;
to participants in MDTA or CETA. These evaluations demonstrate the importance&#13;
of longitudinal data (i.e. before and after training) and comparison groups&#13;
(i.e. trainees and a control group). Evaluations which are based on simple&#13;
cross section data or which do not have a control group are likely to be&#13;
misleading. Further, it is shown that placement rates are a poor performance&#13;
indicator of prime sponsors' training efforts.&#13;
In Britain the state provides limited training facilities for adults,&#13;
many of whom come to the training place from employment rather than unemploy-&#13;
ment. Evaluations of such state provision are discussed. It is frequently&#13;
asserted that the quantity and quality of training is deficient in Britain&#13;
as compared with that in other European countries. Three sorts of market&#13;
failure - externalities, imperfect capital markets and labour market monopoly -&#13;
which could be responsible for this deficiency are discussed.&#13;
3.1 US public training programmes&#13;
There are a number of good surveys which evaluate the impact of US&#13;
manpower programmes (e.g. Borus 1972, Bloch 1979) therefore an extensive&#13;
survey of this literature would be gratuitous. Instead, it is worth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
focussing on the great difficulty in correctly evaluating public training.&#13;
Most studies simply have not made all the necessary controls (inciuding&#13;
the British studies surveyed below) and it is likely that earlier rate of&#13;
return estimates are awry (see Bassi 1983, 1984 for a clear technical&#13;
discussion of the statistical problems, with an application to GETA).&#13;
We focus on individual (i.e. private) returns to CETA training, and&#13;
its predecessor MDTA.  The major difficulty in estimating the impact of&#13;
training (or education) on earnings is selection bias, sometimes called&#13;
population heterogeneity. In the absence of an experimental design where&#13;
individuals are randomly assigned between groups, it is likely that the&#13;
decision to participate in the training progra"me, or the selection process,&#13;
is highly correlated with unobservable factors which also help determine&#13;
earnings. This can result in the impact of training being either over-&#13;
estimated or underestimated.   For example, individuals may self-select into&#13;
CETA or are selected by administrators on the basis of innate ability or&#13;
intelligence - on which there is no data. If very able 'individuals are&#13;
selected onto the training programme, the payoff to training wll be over-&#13;
estimated. Assuming that this individual characteristic - innate ability -&#13;
is constant over time the statistical problem can be overcome by what is&#13;
known as a fixed effects model. 'That this does is take an earnings functi'on&#13;
prior to training and an earnings function post training and difference them.&#13;
thus causing the unobserved innate ability to drop out and leaving the change&#13;
in earnings over time to be a function of participation in CETA.    An alter-&#13;
native possibility is to-use an autoregressive model where pre-training&#13;
earnings are used as a control: previous earnings should capture the&#13;
(unobservable) innate ability fiked effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
There remains a problem with the fixed effects model if creaming occurs.&#13;
If, from among the pool of eligible applicants, administrators choose "only&#13;
those individuals with the highest possible permanent income and the greatest&#13;
negative transitory income" (Bassi 1983, p.542) i.e. if they choose those&#13;
individuals who are only eligible for the programme because of (temporary)&#13;
bad luck. This problem can be overcome by setting the base period benchmark&#13;
to be a few years prior to programme participation. (There is a further&#13;
statistical problem - simultaneity bias - if the training decision is endogenous&#13;
to the individual, see Kiefer (1979) for a full discussion).&#13;
Evidence on the private returns to public training in the US is given&#13;
in Table 3.1. This shows vividly how important it is to use a fixed effects&#13;
model or autoregressive model rather than a simple cross section model to&#13;
estimate the returns to training. Kiefer (1979) investigated the return to&#13;
MDTA training using a sample of 600 male trainees and controls. In a simple&#13;
cross section to explain earnings three quarters after training he finds&#13;
training is negatively associated with earnings (earnings here includes both&#13;
the wage and the probability of employment). In this cross section regression&#13;
he controls for age, schooling, race, marital status and region but still&#13;
finds that individuals who went through MDTA training have, other things&#13;
equal, earnings 11 per cent below non-trainees. However, when the analysis&#13;
is done properly, using a fixed effects model, training is positively&#13;
associated with earnings. It is clear, therefore, that the simple cross&#13;
section result is misleading and is the result of selection bias - less able&#13;
individuals went through the MDTA programme and in the simple statistical&#13;
analysis this showed up as training reducing earnings.&#13;

The most thorough analysis of CETA training is by Bassi (1983). She&#13;
analyses the 1976 CETA cohort and an equivalent comparison group. The&#13;
change in the annual earnings of CETA participants as compared with non-&#13;
participants is given in Table 3.1. Participation in CETA is positively&#13;
associated with the change in earnings and training has a bigger effect on&#13;
women's earnings than on male earnings.&#13;
The autoregressive method of controlling for selection bias is used by&#13;
Sawhey et al. (1982). They study the impact of CETA Title I training&#13;
programmes administered by the Boston prime sponsor. Their comparison group&#13;
is individuals who had applied for, but not received, training. They identify&#13;
separately the payoff to particular types of CETA training like autos,&#13;
clerical etc.   The impact of CETA training is divided into its effect on job&#13;
retention and its effect on the wage. In both cases the most important&#13;
determinants of the employment status and current post-training wage are&#13;
the type of training and job characteristics, demographic characteristics&#13;
are relatively unimportant. On employment status, those individuals who&#13;
completed CETA training were 49 per cent more likely to have retained their&#13;
jobs six months post training than non-trainees. And for those in employment&#13;
CETA training is associated with trainee wages $0.20 per hour (1976-77&#13;
dollars) higher than the wage for equivalent non-trainees. But there is&#13;
considerable variation round this average: four types of training - medical,&#13;
food preparation, automotive and new careers - yield at least 30 cents per&#13;
hour extra, while shop, clerical, home-maker and electronic training yield&#13;
jobs paying not much more than those held by non-trainee comparison group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Even proper longitudinal studies, with a control group, seldcom have&#13;
information on earnings for a long period after training. An exception is&#13;
the fascinating study of Fredland and LittIle (1980) on the rctur.s (in&#13;
civilian life) to military vocational training. Their sample    s 'i,306&#13;
white men aged 45Â°49 in 1966, of whom 352 had received vocationE'. training&#13;
in the military often during World War U. A cross section regression on&#13;
1966 earnings was estimated, Control variables included school4ng, job&#13;
tenure, socioÂ°economic status and region.   fhose who use their i,I'litary&#13;
vocational training in their civilian jobs get a premium in annuta earnings&#13;
of 12 per cent.  Those who received, but did not use their mili'ary vocationa"^&#13;
education get no pay premium. A similar pattern holds for users and non-&#13;
users of civilian vocational training.   These results arc important in&#13;
context of whether vocational training actually raises productivity or&#13;
whether it is merely a screening device, Assuming that there is no ability&#13;
difference between users and non-users of vocational training tie results&#13;
imply that such training does raise productivity    it is only t':e users&#13;
that get a premium.&#13;
Federal manpower training programmes normally use a delivery system&#13;
in which the planning of types of courses and choices of schools have been&#13;
the responsibility of either public administrators or various voluntraer&#13;
members of manpower planning boards. O'Neil (197i) suggests that greater&#13;
reliance on the private market mechanism might be both more eff icient and&#13;
more equitable.  Thus the extensive proprietary vocational - tt.hnical&#13;
school industry could be used to supply training places and/or programme&#13;
participants could be given more discretion in choosing both the type of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-51-&#13;
training they wish to take and the institution they wish to attend by more&#13;
use of voucher-delivery systems. O'Neil examines the payoff to the GI Bill,&#13;
which uses a voucher-delivery system and contains sub-groups of recipients&#13;
and training options that are similar to those of manpower programmes. He&#13;
finds, using longitudinal data with appropriate controls, that the GI Bill-&#13;
supported vocational training is associated with an earnings increase of&#13;
around 10 per cent, rather higher than the estimate (for men) for Federal&#13;
manpower training programmes. Further black veterans participate more than&#13;
non-black veterans in GI Bill-supported vocational training, and they gain&#13;
more from such training than non-blacks.&#13;
We have shown that the most thorough way of calculating the private&#13;
return to public (or private) vocational training programmes is from&#13;
longitudinal data on earnings for participants and a comparison group. In&#13;
view of the fact that it is difficult (i.e. expensive) to collect longitudinal&#13;
data on earnings the US Department of Labor compare the performance of prime&#13;
sponsors and their contractors by constructing placement data. But Gay&#13;
and Borus (1980) show that placement in a job within three months after&#13;
leaving a program is among the poorest performance indicators. This variable&#13;
was not significantly correlated (where the observations are prime sponsors)&#13;
with subsequent gain in earnings for any of the 20 race/sex/programme groups&#13;
they studied. They conclude that "placement data provide no useful inform-&#13;
ation for judging the relative effectiveness of prime sponsors by the US&#13;
Department of Labor or of contractors by local prime sponsors when considering&#13;
earnings gain". (p.42). They point to several reasons why merely&#13;
obtaining employment following training is unlikely to be related to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
long-run impact of the programme.  First, job placement does noit convey any&#13;
information on the nature or quality o-f post-programme employmen"t. Changes&#13;
in weeks worked, wage rates and earnings each embrace additiona; direansions&#13;
of post-programme work experience and thus have a better chance of reflect-&#13;
ing subsequent long run benefits. Second, many job placements arc not&#13;
related to the skills acquired during training, so placement may t!ot by itself&#13;
constitute an improvement in a trainee's labour market circumstnces. Third,&#13;
additional job search may turn up a job with better long run prospects.&#13;
3.2 Vocational training in Britain&#13;
Three issues are addressed here. First, we describe the eXtent of&#13;
vocational training in the British labour force and analyse who gets trained&#13;
and the impact of such training on occupational status end mobility. It is&#13;
generally held that the British training effort is deficient compared with&#13;
other countries.  Therefore, second, we avialyse some economic aspects of&#13;
public provsi      of adult training.  This provides insights into, for examples&#13;
cost-benefit analysis using a beforo/after meth.od rather than a control group&#13;
and the impact of the recession on the payoff to stato-provided vocationa'&#13;
training.  Third, not only can the state provide training itself, it can&#13;
also intervene to make the private market for training work better,   Various&#13;
market failures have been alleged, inc'luding extL'ernafities (poaching trainied&#13;
labour), imperfect capital markets, and non-compctitive labour marknts.&#13;
These are examined in turn. The major omission in this discussion of&#13;
vocazional training in Britain conccrns the recent expansion or^ public&#13;
support   mainly in the form of allowances    to the Youth Training Scheme&#13;
(YTS).  Essentially YTS is for school leavers who would otherw;se be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
unemployed. Although it is supposed to have a training component it was&#13;
introduced in the face of rising youth unemployment rather than because of&#13;
concern over the quantity and quality of teenager training. In any event&#13;
the YTS only came on stream in 1983 so it is too early to evaluate it yet.&#13;
Extent and effects of vocational training in Britain&#13;
The National Training Survey was commissioned by the Manpower Services&#13;
Commission in 1975 and 1976 to provide a comprehensive picture of the stock&#13;
of skills in the labour force, the education and training undertaken to&#13;
acquire them and the uses to which they were put. Some 54,000 people were&#13;
interviewed, representing l-in-500 of the working population. Training was&#13;
very broadly defined, as "anything which may have helped you do the work".&#13;
This definition covered all the types of vocational courses, both on-and-off&#13;
the job, but excluded academic courses at colleges i.e. it excludes much&#13;
vocational training which leads to a formal qualification like a teaching&#13;
certificate (Claydon 1980). Over 60 per cent of respondents said they had&#13;
undertaken some form of training during their working life (three quarters&#13;
of men compared to half of the women) and almost half of this had been on-&#13;
the-job. This implied that 11.5 million men and 7.5 million women in the&#13;
working population had received some training.&#13;
Greenhalgh and Stewart (1982) have analysed the NTS data using a logit&#13;
model to see who did and did not receive full-time training (as defined&#13;
above) during the period 1965-74. Separate information is presented for&#13;
men, single women and other women. Not surprisingly age has a stronger&#13;
effect on the probability of training than any other variable. Each&#13;
additional year of age reduces the probability of training by 6 per cent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54-&#13;
The occupational position at the start of the ten year period (.965-/4) is&#13;
positively related to the probability of training during the ftcade for&#13;
men and single women but negatively related for married women. L ke" ki sea&#13;
for men, the higher the qualifications possessed at the beginni'gi of 'he&#13;
period the more likely a spell of training during the period.      'ay,&#13;
married men are more likely to have a spell of trainIng than sg!e l'en&#13;
The impact of training on occupational status has also been examined.&#13;
Greenhalgh and Stewart (1982, Table 10) find that, for men9 a spell of full&#13;
time vocational training pre-l965 of a year or longer raises    te occupational&#13;
status in 1975 by 7 per cent and a spell of any length betwen !965 and 19/5&#13;
has a similar effect. Metcalf and Nickell (1982) confirm that occupationa0&#13;
movements between 1965 and 1975 are positively associated with vocational&#13;
training:  those men who had a short course of fuli time vocational training&#13;
(4 weeks or less) rose in the occupational standings by 1 per cent for each&#13;
week of such training.&#13;
Vocational training is, other things equa5, associated with a higher&#13;
level occupation. There has also been concern in Britain that, as comparedi&#13;
with Germany, the extent and type of vocational education is associated w.ith&#13;
the economic performance of the country (Prais 1981, Sorge arid ;!arner 1980).&#13;
Prais argues that the essential difference between Britain and Germany is 1n&#13;
the proportions of the labour force with intermediate qualifications such as&#13;
apprenticeships or full secretarial qualifications. The figurn for Britain&#13;
is around 30 per cent while the corresponding German f1gure is ttiice as&#13;
large. The German system emphasises formal exams, both in classrooms and&#13;
on-the-job, while the British system is more informnl and has no proper test&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-&#13;
of the on-the-job training element. Prais concludes that "In a world of&#13;
more rapid technical progress and faster economic change, the balance of&#13;
advantage has shifted towards systems which provide a much greater stock&#13;
of transferable skills, in which formal training and external examinations -&#13;
of both theoretical and practical aspects - play predominating roles".&#13;
Sixty five years ago Alfred Marshall (1919) wrote that "All the world has&#13;
much to learn from German methods of education" and Prais demonstrates that,&#13;
for Britain at least, that is still true. We now turn to examine state&#13;
provision of adult training and the role the state might play in correcting&#13;
market failure which results in the underprovision of skilled labour.&#13;
Public training programmes for adults in Britain&#13;
Some Â£3 billion is spent on all adult training throughout further&#13;
education and industry. Most public spending on adult training and&#13;
retraining is via the Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS). This offers&#13;
(i) training to unemployed individuals in skills which are intended to lead&#13;
directly to employment, (ii) work preparation courses to reduce particular&#13;
difficulties experienced by some people in finding jobs. Full details of&#13;
TOPS training is given in Table 3.2. TOPS cost Â£230 million in 1982/83,&#13;
of which Â£72 million was the cost of the skill-centres (net of trainee&#13;
allowances). The MSC has a network of 68 skill-centres and 20 annexes which&#13;
employ 4,500 staff and which supply off-the-job training under MSC programmes&#13;
and to employers who contract for their services. Skill-centre courses last&#13;
for around six months and the individual is trained to near craft standard.&#13;

The payoff to skill-centre training (skill-centres were previously&#13;
named Government Training Centres) has been analysed in a whole series of&#13;
publications by Ziderman (1969, 1973, 1975, 1975a, 1976, 1978). Some&#13;
typical results are reported in Table 3.3. In all this reserach Ziderman&#13;
had no control group therefore he uses the before/after method (see Section 6).&#13;
He only has earning information for the period up to around 2 years post-&#13;
training, so he assumes the pay differential at the 2 year post-training&#13;
point will persist into the future. As he has no control group he has no&#13;
information on what the employment and earnings experience of the trainees&#13;
would have been if they had no been through the GTC. Therefore he uses a&#13;
stochastic Markov chain model to predict by computer simulation the&#13;
hypothetical employment pattern of enrollees in the absence of training.&#13;
The employment status of "non-participants" (i.e. of the enrollees, had&#13;
they not, infact, participated in the programme) is estimated in terms of&#13;
proportions unemployed and employed, at various points of time from the&#13;
start of the programme. These, together with earnings data relating to&#13;
trainees in the 'before' period (suitably corrected for the secular rise in&#13;
incomes over the period) provide estimates of mean earnings that programme&#13;
enrollees would have received had they not participated in the programme.&#13;
The private rate of return to GTC training is higher for those who were&#13;
employed prior to training than those who were unemployed because of the&#13;
post-training. The social rate of return is below the private rate and its&#13;
value depends on the assumptions made about replacement and displacement.&#13;

In all cases except zero replacement and displacement the rate of return&#13;
adopting a ten year time horizon shows that in the 1960s the investment was&#13;
very profitable and this is one reason why public adult training places&#13;
were expanded in the 1970s.&#13;
Some attention has been given to where state4adult training centres&#13;
should be located. Hughes (1975) suggests that the regional location&#13;
pattern should be based on: (i) total applications for GTC courses per&#13;
region in relation to training places available, should the policy objective&#13;
of GTCs be social rather than economic; (ii) incidence of structural&#13;
unemployment, in relation to training places, if economic objectives prevail;&#13;
and (iii) as a supplementary criterion, the capacity utilisation rate, as&#13;
a measure of the efficiency with which the capacity is used. On the basis&#13;
of these criteria Hughes argues that the northern part of Britain is over-&#13;
endowed with GTC places relative to the southern part (historically the&#13;
northern part of Britain has an unemployment rate double that in the southern&#13;
part). But Ziderman argues that location decisions should be based on cost-&#13;
benefit analysis and shows that the social payoff to GTCs (now skill centres)&#13;
is higher in the north than the south. This debate is unresolved but is&#13;
clearly important, particularly if the supply of training places is to be&#13;
contracted or expanded.&#13;
There is evidence that the high rates of return to public training of&#13;
adults (Table 3.3) are now a thing of the past. The employment experience&#13;
of TOPS graduates at the end of 1982, three months after finishing their&#13;
courses was:&#13;

In employments using skills (%)              3 f                 45&#13;
Thus only around half the graduates from training progralmes iuJre in amployment&#13;
three months after finishing their training and only two fifh twere using&#13;
their skills. The difference between the skill centre figures a~nd those for&#13;
non-skill-centres partly reflects the poor empinyfiient prospects in the&#13;
mechanical engineering craft occupations which form a Si     cG   t proport`on&#13;
of skill-centre training.   In the face of this evidence the TO'S    prograrrume&#13;
is to be halved.  SkillÂ°centres wi'll, in futuri,, operate on a +,ost-recovery&#13;
basis (i.e. the individual or the firm will be charged for the braining)&#13;
which will cut down on speculative training0 Rather public spending on adult&#13;
training will in future concentratse on upgrading technical ski'ls (50Q000 p.a.)&#13;
and will help training in informa'ion technology (5bO00O p.a.)o This expansion&#13;
in the training programme is mainly addressed to already-employnd workers and&#13;
some schemes will be financed by loans (rather than trainee aP:ewances and&#13;
zero fees).  Unemployed people will be catelred for malnly by-s,, icing a&#13;
training component into the Community Proqraviefln for the long tkrn jobless.&#13;
There will also be a big expansion in tra-ining for self epioyent=&#13;
Around a tenth of th British labour force is self employed. Tf'9 New Enterorise&#13;
Programme (NEP) is designed to train people for self employment     XIt is&#13;
directly financed by the Manpower Services Cspaieission (DS!) wh oh specifias&#13;
the objective of NEP as getting people into business "'quicker, *:,th fewer&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

unemployed at the time they go on the course. Each programme lasts 16 weeks.&#13;
The first month is a residential period at a Business School and the remaining&#13;
twelve weeks are spent putting a business proposal into practice. A small&#13;
NEP has been evaluated by Johnson and Thomas (1982). The cost side was&#13;
straightforward. But the benefits side is problematic. They had no control&#13;
group so they simply asked trainees what their employment would have been in&#13;
the asbence of training. The interview took place two years after the NEP&#13;
and they assume that the benefits last for five years. Thus participants&#13;
had to forecast actual employment for years 3, 4, 5 and alternative employment&#13;
for all five years. The authors made various assumptions about the extent to&#13;
which the output of the new firms displace output of existing firms. The&#13;
calculated social internal rate of return (using only a 5 year benefit period)&#13;
is 20 per cent. This suggests that the proposed expansion of training for the&#13;
self employed is sensible.&#13;
Public intervention to support training provided by firms&#13;
It is generally believed that Britain has insufficient skilled labour.&#13;
Three market failure arguments - externalities, imperfect capital markets and&#13;
labour market monopolies - have been advanced as possible causes.&#13;
First, the 1964 Industrial Training Act established a system of Industrial&#13;
Training Boards (ITBs) with the right to impose levies on and to pay grants&#13;
to firms. The object of the Act was to increase the supply of skilled labour&#13;
by "re-distribution of the burden of providing industrial training from firms&#13;
which were relatively generous providers to those which undertook relatively&#13;
little" (Jones and Hollenstein 1983). Supporters of the grant-levy approach&#13;
argued that some firms incurred net costs to provide training in skills which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62-&#13;
were transferable among firms. In turn, firms not providing training poached&#13;
away the trained labour. This, it was argued, was unfair and inefficient&#13;
because ultimately the supply of firms providing training would dry up. But&#13;
there was no analysis of how this situation arose in the first place and how&#13;
poaching-firms and training-firms existed side-by-side.&#13;
Second, opponents of the grant-levy approach argued that the costs and&#13;
benefits of general training for transferable skills accrued to the individual&#13;
and poaching was therefore irrelevant. Rather, if there were not enough trainees,&#13;
this was because the capital markets were working badly and individuals could&#13;
not borrow to augment their skills. In this case the solution to any deficiency&#13;
in the supply of trained labour was not to introduce a grant-levy system but&#13;
to intervene to improve the supply of funds for investment in human capital.&#13;
Third, there may be an insufficient supply of generally trained labour&#13;
with transferable skills if trainee pay is high relative to the earnings of&#13;
skilled labour. Jones and Hollenstein show that the higher is trainee pay&#13;
relative to that of skilled workers, the lower will be the employers' demand&#13;
for all types of trainee labour and the less skill-intensive and more firm-&#13;
specific on average will be the training opportunities offered. In Britain&#13;
the earnings of apprentices and other initial trainees are double or treble&#13;
those of apprentices in Germany and Switzerland over the period of their&#13;
apprenticeship and it is unlikely that their productivity is correspondingly&#13;
higher. Three solutions suggest themselves to this problem: (i) parties to&#13;
the pay bargain might try to mirror the competitive outcome more nearly;&#13;
(ii) trainee wages could be subsidised; (iii) more general training could&#13;
be provided in public sector institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-63-&#13;
3.3 Summary&#13;
The supply of skilled labour in industrialised countries may be deficient&#13;
because of externalities (poaching), imperfect capital markets which make it&#13;
difficult for a person to finance his training or labour market monopolies&#13;
which cause the trainees wage to be high relative to his productivity. The&#13;
state therefore sometimes intervenes to increase the supply of skilled labour.&#13;
Forms of intervention include a levy-grant system, subsidising trainee wages&#13;
and public provision of training slots.&#13;
The studies surveyed here evaluate public training programmes by using&#13;
earnings data. The results suggest that the best evaluations have both&#13;

SECT(ION 4&#13;
Substitution&#13;
41 Introduction&#13;
Before thinking about the method of eva'ouating vocationa training two&#13;
prior issues need to be considered, First, js the production t:zchnique in&#13;
the firm or industry economically efficient? Xf it is not, and a more labour-&#13;
intensive technique would be appropriate, then eii1ployment of both skilled and&#13;
and unskilled labour miqht need to rise. Second, given the output and the&#13;
capital is it possible to substitute less skilled for more skcoiled labour?&#13;
Therefore we must pay a passing glance to the elasticity of substitution&#13;
between capital and labour and between differont labour types.&#13;
There are many reasons for estimating such substitution &amp;.asticities.&#13;
These reasons include: to test the helpfulness of manpower p'.ans; to&#13;
determine whether or not extra education is a powerful vehicle to a'ter the&#13;
income distribution; growth accounting; to test the impact of subsidies on&#13;
either capital or labour;   and to see the substitution possIbilities within&#13;
a training programme. It is this last point that is examined here.&#13;
Empirical estimation of the elasticity of substitution is necessary to study&#13;
the effect of a training programme which converts low to high skilled labour.&#13;
The effects depend on how substitutable these are in production, for the&#13;
substitutability will determine the extent of the change in        r reative&#13;
wages in the new post-training equilibrium.    A positive value for the&#13;
elasticity implies that the factors are substitutes and a negative value&#13;
implies that they are complements.&#13;
4.2  A   priate technol9gy and the demand for ski lied labour&#13;
The issues of the appropriate production technology is controversial,j&#13;
especially in developing countries. For our purposes the imiportant strand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-65-&#13;
of this analysis is the skill requirements implied by a more labour-intensive&#13;
technology. Even lower skill intensities in the appropriate least cost&#13;
technology may require a larger absolute number of skilled workers given the&#13;
greater total employment.&#13;
Some evidence on this is given in Table 4.1 taken from Pack's (1982)&#13;
illuminating survey. In shoes and leather processing the appropriate (i.e.&#13;
more labour-intensive) technology requires a higher proportion of skilled&#13;
workers than the capital intensive technology, while in brickmaking and&#13;
maize milling the skill intensity of the labour force is higher with the&#13;
capital intensive technology than with the appropriate technology. But even&#13;
lower skill intensities in the appropriate technology in brick production&#13;
and in maize milling require a larger absolute number of skilled workers.&#13;
As Pack points out, critics who are sceptical of the feasibility of labour-&#13;
intensive technology might well feel vindicated by such a result: even in&#13;
brickmaking, in which the skill intensity per project is lower with the least&#13;
cost technique, the aggregate skill requirement is greater. That requirement&#13;
reflects both the larger total employment per project and the larger total&#13;
number of projects that can be undertaken given their lower capital-output&#13;
ratio.&#13;
But the analysis cannot end here. Pack points out that what is required&#13;
is a calculation of the cost of obtaining the additional skills and a&#13;
comparison with the benefits to be obtained from the choice of least-cost&#13;
technology thus made possible. Table 4.2 presents such computations for&#13;
leather processing and for shoe manufacturing, the two sectors showing the&#13;
largest absolute increase in skill requirements. The figures are the benefit-&#13;
cost ratios that prospective investors could anticipate from expenditure on&#13;

skills necessary to implement appropriate technology. These are indeed&#13;
"remarkably high" and "they suggest that those who believe skill constraints&#13;
to be the principal factor limiting the adoption of labour-intensive technologies&#13;
might consider advocating a bundling of the requisite education and investment&#13;
funds rather than urging a resort to capital-intensive technologies" (p.24).&#13;
While training associated with Bank projects typically takes the technology&#13;
as given the need for such labour-skill upgrading would be even greater, it&#13;
seems, with appropriate technology.&#13;
4.3 Substitution among different types of labour&#13;
If the technology and output level are taken as given we should ask&#13;
whether different types of labour are substitutable for each other in the&#13;
production process. If it is easy to substitute unskilled labour for skilled&#13;
labour (i.e. if the elasticity of substitution is high) obviously training&#13;
is needed less than if such a substitution is difficult (i.e. if the elasticity&#13;
of substitution is low).&#13;
Before turning to the results of various studies I wish to mention, very&#13;
briefly, some serious estimation choices and problems, which interact to&#13;
cause us to treat the estimates of the substitution elasticity with some&#13;
scepticism.&#13;
First, is the elasticity of substitution between different labour types&#13;
to be estimated via a production function (e.g. Layard et al. 1971), a cost&#13;
function (e.g. Nissim 1982) or simply by contrasting relative wages with-&#13;
relative employment levels? Most studies use the last approach.&#13;
Second, the observations can be drawn from time series or a cross section.&#13;
If cross section data are used they can refer to countries, regions, industries&#13;
or firms.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-69-&#13;
Third, how should the labour input be defined? For our purposes&#13;
we are interested in studies of substitution between skilled and unskilled&#13;
labour or between labour with different education levels rather than between&#13;
age categories or sex. But how aggregate or disaggregate is the level of&#13;
skill to be defined. Most studies aggregate labour into only two or three&#13;
categories. This is bound to miss something. For example, it may well be&#13;
that substitution possibilities are greater between (say) semi-skilled and&#13;
unskilled workers than they are in the higher categories of management.&#13;
Layard et al. (1971) attempted a fivefold classification of labour in their&#13;
study of the relationship between economic performance and qualified manpower&#13;
in 68 factories in the electrical engineering industry. They were unable to&#13;
say anything definite about substituting more trained for less trained workers&#13;
and indeed, were forced in the end to estimate the production function with&#13;
only two labour types. (We may note in passing that such aggregation is one&#13;
reason why manpower forecasting is ostensibly so attractive - it has a range&#13;
of occupational titles that cannot be matched in substitution studies or rate&#13;
of return analysis).&#13;
Fourth, most studies use the "short cut" estimation method of associating&#13;
relative wages by skill group with relative employment by skill group and&#13;
simply assume that the observations lie on a labour demand curve. Tinbergen&#13;
(1974) points out that strictly studies should control for the elasticity&#13;
of supply of labour too but very few do so. For an example of a study that&#13;
'did make such a control see Fallon and Layard (1975).&#13;
Thus, fifth, there is a question of the simultaneous determination of&#13;
relative pay and relative employment. However, when such an association is&#13;
estimated at industry level it seems correct to take relative wages as the-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exogenous variables (e.g. Knight 1979). This in turn raises a 'urther&#13;
related problem:  when the observations refer to one country -'.dustries&#13;
or firms perhaps - there may be insufficient variation in relative wages&#13;
to obtain good estimates of the substitution elasticity.&#13;
Sixth, what other variables should be included in the statistical&#13;
analysis? In cross country studies it seems important to control for&#13;
industrial structure (Bowles 1970). If capital is ignored, as it is in&#13;
many studies, we get biased   estimates of labour    labour substitutiCon&#13;
unless labour is separable from capital, i.e. unless the elasticity of&#13;
substitution between capital and the various types of labour siills are&#13;
identical.  When capital and industrial structure are included in the&#13;
anaysis and we also control for the supply elasticity the resu!ting&#13;
estimates of the substitution elasticity fall sharply compared with&#13;
estimates made without such controls.&#13;
The results of some studies wihich have attempted to analyse labour&#13;
labour sustitution are given in Tables 4.3 and 4.4. Table 4.3 presents&#13;
estimates from cross section studies and Table 4.4 from two studies which&#13;
use time series data.   The results are selective because the authors&#13;
typically present more estimates than I have reported.    The results seem&#13;
clear on two counts.   First, unskilled labour and skilled labour are&#13;
generally substitutes (i.e. the sign of the elasticity of substitution is&#13;
positive). Second, the size of the substitution elasticity is perhaps&#13;
somewhat smaller than was thought on the basis of previous eslt-:m'ates done&#13;
more than a decade ago. These results are in line with those surveyed by&#13;
Hamermesh and Grant (1979) for the U.S. who conclude "Almost a'"l the studies&#13;

find that production workers and capital are substitutes, as are production&#13;
and non-production workers" (p.529). Likewise, Tinbergen and Psacharopoulos&#13;
(1983 Table D4) surveyed nine studies and in each case found that highly&#13;
trained labour and other labour are substitutes in the process of production.&#13;
The thrust of these results from statistical analyses is confirmed in&#13;
an illuminating case study approach which examined the labour and capital&#13;
inputs in a number of thermal power stations over a range of different&#13;
countries (Shiba 1983). It was found that given the technology "a high&#13;
level of education can be substituted for lack of experience" and across&#13;
plants the average experience level of the labour force is negatively&#13;
associated with the level of education. Further, more sophisticated&#13;
technology requires a higher level of education and experience, confirming&#13;
the complementarity between physical and human capital.&#13;
4.4 Conclusion&#13;
The results discussed here have two important implications for vocational&#13;
training.   First, economically efficient production technologies sometimes&#13;
imply more labour intensive technology which, in turn will tend to raise the&#13;
demand for skilled labour and in turn, vocational training requirements&#13;
increase. Second, in general, holding output constant, less skilled labour is,&#13;
apparently, a substitute for skilled-labour in the production process rather&#13;
than a complement to it. Indeed, it may well be that the studies surveyed&#13;
here understate the true degree of substitutability among different labour&#13;
*types (see e.g. Bennell). Thus labour is usually measured according to&#13;
the occupation-description ("electrical engineer") rather than what the&#13;
person actually does ("maintenance technician"). Training design certainly&#13;
needs to operate on the basis of tasks rather than labels. Although the -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74.-&#13;
studies surveyed in this section do not relate specifically to the level&#13;
of the firm (typically the data refer to industries or whole eco.omics)&#13;
the possibility that less skilled labour is substitutable for more skilled&#13;
labour, and vice versa, needs careful investigation prior to any evaluation&#13;
of vocational training.&#13;
APPENDIX&#13;
The elasticity of substitution (a.j) between different types of labour&#13;
L. and LV represents the inverse of the percentage change in tVe ratio of&#13;
wages assoicated with a given percentage change in the ratio of labour&#13;
quantities. Explicitly:&#13;
a (Li /Lj )/(L j/Lj)&#13;
0.. = Â°             I     j&#13;
a log (L /Lj)&#13;
-   a log (w /w;)&#13;
A positive value for the elasticity irmplies that the factors are substitutes&#13;
and a negative value implies that they are complements.&#13;

SECTION 5&#13;
Firm level studies&#13;
5.1 Introduction&#13;
"Recent work on the economics of training has tended to dismiss the&#13;
possibility of using data obtained from individual firms" stated Thomas et al.&#13;
(1969). Some fifteen years on that statement is generally still true. This&#13;
is a pity because the few studies conducted at firm or plant level are&#13;
outstanding. In what follows we initially examine one recent study which&#13;
focusses on training costs, paying special attention to the thorny problem&#13;
of estimating the costs associated with training carried out jointly with&#13;
the production process. Then three issues on the benefits side are examined.&#13;
First, if earnings are not used, how can extra output associated with the&#13;
training be measured? It turns out that a rich variety of measures have&#13;
been used including downtime, firm output, job performance and reduced&#13;
turnover. Further, training may reduce input costs rather than increase&#13;
output. Second, what do firm-level studies tell us about experience -&#13;
earnings and experience - productivity profiles? In particular is the&#13;
assumption of human capital theory that the experience-earnings profile can&#13;
be explained by the experience-productivity profile confirmed? This is of&#13;
profound importance to those who wish to estimate firm-level or social rates&#13;
of return to training. In fact, the evidence counsels caution on the use of&#13;
human capital theory. Finally, we briefly note two studies, one for the US&#13;
and one for India, which have related a (non-earnings) output measure to&#13;
the type of training -received.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.2 Training costs&#13;
An early study of training at the firm levei (Thomas, Moxham and Jones&#13;
1969) identified seven dimensions of the cost of training: iÂ½iriiating the&#13;
training function;  servicing and co-ordinating the training fun:cticn;&#13;
fixed training capital; working training capital;    providing instruction;&#13;
giving instruction; and wages of tra,nees, net of trained output value.&#13;
These costs were fully discussed in Zymelman (1976). More recently Ryan&#13;
(1980) suggested three cost categories in his lucid and complete examination&#13;
of an arc welding training programme at a major US shipyard.&#13;
The flavour of Ryan's analysis is given in Figure 5.. He^ defines&#13;
job training as comprising "all forms of learning which raise an individua)&#13;
from requisite general educationai attainment towards the leve, of competence&#13;
characteristic of experienced workers in the job in question' (p.334). The&#13;
curve p.y (t) in Figure 5.1 depicts the learning curve of trainee net output&#13;
(valued at a price p) for a training programme consisting of an initial&#13;
spell of formal training in a company school (0t, periods) followed by a&#13;
phase of informal training consisting of instruction and/or learning by&#13;
doing on actual production work. The training period is defined not by the&#13;
period of explicit instruction in job techniques but by the time (0t) it&#13;
takes a typical individual to obtain the plateau of output,'.&#13;
Ryan indicates that both the employer and trainee may bear the costs&#13;
of job training. The individual bears costs in the form of foregone earnings.&#13;
'If his actual path of earnings is defined by w(t) and his alternative&#13;
earnings by w'(t) then foregone earnings are represented by arca bcd. The&#13;
cost to the firm is trainee pay less (net) trainee output. Xn figure S.l&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Firm level case studies indica;Ce that it is possible to get at the&#13;
costs of formal training, possible    but tricky    to get at foregone earnings,&#13;
but very difficult to calculate the net costs of informal trainTIng.&#13;
Ryan states that "the most accessible costs are the resources committed&#13;
by employers to courses of formal training conducted in company schools,&#13;
which can be estimated in a relatively straightforward manner from accounting&#13;
records and purchase prices".   Earnings foregone can be got frcm direct&#13;
estimates (this is what is done in the recent evaluations of government&#13;
training, where earnings in (last) employment prior to training are used),&#13;
personal interviews and data on the relevant iabour market.&#13;
Estimating the cost to the firm of on the job training is difficult.&#13;
Problems include: (i) the price the output of the trainee is sold for;&#13;
(ii) how to measure trainee output,;   (iii) how to measure trainee usage&#13;
of other resources such as equipment and instruction, and of the value to&#13;
the firm of alternative uses of such incremental resources: thus we&#13;
requ-re information on the variation with (in)experience of productivity&#13;
supervisory requirements, machine wear and tear etc. Valuation of trainee&#13;
output (i.e. problems (i) and (ii) above combined) is the most difficult&#13;
task. Ryan points out that as most workers perform only a subset of the&#13;
many operations involved in the completion of a marketable products a&#13;
shadow price is required for their intermediate products.     (here are two&#13;
possible ways of estimating shadow prices:&#13;
I     (a)  via the payments system:   Thomas et al] (1969) use th.e ingenious&#13;
assumption that pay and value product of trainees are equal at the 'breakeven&#13;
level of output level which makes a worker eligible for bonus payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
However, this assumption is arbitrary. As Ryan points out, it requires&#13;
that the design of the payment system be informed by the very same training&#13;
costs which are to be estimated on the basis of assumption.&#13;
(b) via the finances of the training programme i.e. from the influence&#13;
of such a shadow price on both the costs and returns of informal training.&#13;
If an exogenously imposed rate of return could be assumed the shadow price&#13;
of output would be uniquely determined for a given rate of labour turnover.&#13;
In general, there is no unique value to trainee output. Ryan therefore&#13;
proceeds on the basis that the cost to the firm of informal training is&#13;
estimated by assuming equality between the pay and value product of experienced&#13;
workers.&#13;
Ryan's analysis refers the cost of the core skill required of all&#13;
shipyard welders, the manual welding of heavy guage steel plate with the&#13;
use of coated electrode. The training process consists of an initial spell&#13;
of between six and eight weeks of formal instruction and practice in a&#13;
vestibule school, followed by a year or more of production work until&#13;
proficiency is acquired. Welders are hired at all stages of the learning&#13;
curve. The cost to the firm of training a beginner up to Mechanic status&#13;
is given in Table 5.1 ($1,975). The total cost to the firm was almost&#13;
$6,000. By contrast Ryan calculates that the trainees incurred no financial&#13;
costs - their pay was greater than their best alternative income. The&#13;
returns to the firm from this investment are examined in the section on&#13;
pay, productivity and experience.&#13;

5.3 Productivity, output and input&#13;
Any evaluation of training must have a measure of the benefits of&#13;
that training. Typically such benefits are measured from earnings data.&#13;
But earnings may not, in fact, reflect productivity. For example, pay&#13;
may be related to seniority. Or pay scales may be mandated. Or multi-&#13;
national companies in developing countries may have their own peculiar&#13;
pay scales. And even in the human capital version of earnings determination&#13;
at any point in time pay need not equal productivity. Therefore in this&#13;
section four alternative ways of measuring productivity are examined.&#13;
First, job performance assessed by supervisors is discussed. Second,&#13;
the production function approach - possible where data exist on inputs&#13;
and outputs over a cross section of plants - is presented. Next we&#13;
describe one of the most ingenious studies which details downtime in&#13;
productive equipment. Finally the relationship between labour turnover&#13;
and productivity is noted.&#13;
Job performance&#13;
Human capital theory assumes either explicitly or implicitly, that&#13;
the reason pay rises with experience is because productivity rises with&#13;
experience. This has recently been tested by Medoff (1980) and Medoff&#13;
and Abraham (1981). Here we are only concerned with their measure of&#13;
productivity. Their results, which have profound implications for&#13;
evaluating training, are discussed below. I concentrate here on their&#13;
'discussion of company C (Medoff and Abraham 1981), but the discussion&#13;
of companies A and B (Medoff 1980) is similar.&#13;
The sample is 8,238 white male managerial and professional employees&#13;
at a major US Corporation in the mid 1970's. This company uses two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-82-&#13;
separate measures of job performance: an overall performance rating with&#13;
nine categories and a ranking of each employee relative to others in an&#13;
appropriate comparison group. These measures are prepared by each employees&#13;
immediate supervisor.   The performance rating form gave supervisors the&#13;
following instructions:   "Each employee should be rated on current perforinance&#13;
and contributions based on requirements of his present assignment. An&#13;
emp'oyee should be measured both as to his contribution in termrs of the&#13;
standard of his job and against oT-hers performing similar work at similar&#13;
levels. Career potential and promotability should not enter into ratings&#13;
of an individual's performance". For the rankings management provides&#13;
each supervisor in a department or other appropriate organisat onal unit&#13;
wit) a list of employees doing reasonably comparable leveis of work.&#13;
The crucial question is whether these performance    ratings and rankings&#13;
are good indicators of relative-within-grade level productivity.    nedoff&#13;
and Abraham believe that they do measure productivity satisfactorily, but&#13;
they raise four potential problems. First, in view of their findings&#13;
(see below) that performance declines with seniority, are senior workers&#13;
systematically underrated? For example supervisors might have higher&#13;
expectations of more senior employees in a grade level and systematically&#13;
give them more difficult assignments. In this case rated performance would&#13;
be an understatement of senior employees relative within gra6- level&#13;
productivity. They found no evidence that supervisors do expect more of&#13;
more senior employees within a grade.&#13;
Second, an objective measure of productivivty would be preferable to&#13;
rated performance.   But is is pa-ticularly difficult to get sLch an objective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83-&#13;
measure. The various dimensions of an employee's current true value to his&#13;
or her firm would have to be quantifiable. Further, either there would&#13;
have to be only one dimension relevant for assessing the employees true&#13;
current worth or the researcher would have to know the proper set of weights&#13;
to attach to each relevant dimension.&#13;
Third, there is cause for concern if performance ratings did not&#13;
reflect solely the employees productivity in his current job, but also&#13;
reflected his supervisors assessment of his potential for advancement.&#13;
Other things equal more experienced (older) employees are typically less&#13;
likely to be promoted out of any given grade than less experienced (younger)&#13;
employees: older employees are perceived as having limited potential for&#13;
future advancement. Therefore if performance ratings are affected by&#13;
supervisors assessments of individuals future potential, more experienced&#13;
workers might typically receive lower performance ratings than warranted&#13;
on the basis of their current productivity. In fact, Medoff and Abraham&#13;
find that this is not a problem.&#13;
Fourth, a test of whether performance ratings adequately measure&#13;
productivity concerns promotion probabilities. Assume a company is more&#13;
likely to promote or give large pay rises to those employees in a grade&#13;
level whose current productivity is highest. Therefore if rated performance&#13;
has a singificant positive relationship with the probability of promotion&#13;
or the size of a pay rise this is good evidence that performance measures&#13;
are positively correlated with true within-grade level current productivity.&#13;
There is also a further problem. Performance ratings may satisfactorily&#13;
measure relative productivity among individuals but the ratings may not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accurately reflect the absolute differences, and it is these absolute&#13;
differences which matter when evaluating trairTng. Performance ratings&#13;
may be satisfactory for ordinal rankirgs but inadequate as a cardinal&#13;
scale.&#13;
Fuller (1976) also used worker efficiency ratings as a measure of&#13;
job performance.   His single firm case study was designed to get at the&#13;
cost-effectiveness of different types of traninng in three metal trades -&#13;
turners, millers and grinders - in a large firm in southern Xncia. Fuller&#13;
describes the efficiency rating measure as follows:    "For each mietai&#13;
cutting job standard hours had been estimated for the completicn of various&#13;
tasks. These were based on extensive time and motion studies. A worker's&#13;
efficiency rating was completed by dividing standard hour estimates by actual&#13;
hours required to complete the task.   It -is important to note chat the&#13;
results of all work had to conform to quality standards;    if not a produced&#13;
piece would be rejected and produced again.    Xn this instance a worker would&#13;
be charged with all the hours that he spent on the rejected piece and the&#13;
new piece.  Hence efficiency ratings reflect quality as iwjell as quantity&#13;
of work". To test the reliability of the measure ratings were taken for&#13;
three years and correlated. The lowest correlation was .73. Fuller believes&#13;
that such efficiency ratings are a better measure of job performance than,&#13;
for example, pay:   they are related specificaliy to a worker's individua&#13;
output (quality and quantity), and already take into account extraneous&#13;
factors affecting worker performance such as machine capacity, flow of&#13;
materials from co-workers, ease of access to tools and instruments, and&#13;
hardness of raw materials.   It is interesting to note that (t&lt;-ugh this&#13;
was not the focus of his study) Fuller's results are similar to those of -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85-&#13;
Medoff (1980) and Medoff and Abraham (1981). Pay was positively related&#13;
to seniority but job performance was stable or declined with extra trade&#13;
experience after the first few years on the job.&#13;
Production functions&#13;
Where data are available on inputs and outputs for a number of plants&#13;
in the same industry it is possible to estimate a production function relating&#13;
these inputs and outputs. An example, particularly relevant to firm level&#13;
vocational training is Layard, Sargan, Ager and Jones (1971).    Such a&#13;
production function has two particularly useful properties for our purpose.&#13;
First, it indicates the degree of substitutability among different types&#13;
of labour - it indicates the number of untrained workers who can be replaced&#13;
by one trained worker without loss of output. This whole issue was dealt&#13;
with separately above. Second, it indicates the factors which.influence&#13;
output. The use of an aggregate production function where the outputs of&#13;
many different products are added together, weighted by their market prices&#13;
enables us to calculate productivity (strictly marginal product) directly&#13;
in value terms. Such marginal product estimates are useful, in turn, in&#13;
calculating the social return to training.&#13;
There are a number of statistical problems associated by estimating&#13;
aggregate production functions using plant data. First, aggregation is&#13;
only admissable, strictly, if the separate production functions of the&#13;
different products have constant returns to scale and are identical, except&#13;
for a scale factor applied to output. Thus is is assumed for example that&#13;
the technology behind production of transformers is similar to that for&#13;
producing electrical plugs. Second, great care is needed with measures&#13;
of labour and capital. Third, there are a number of statistical problems..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
These include: (i) multicollinearity; (ii) biased estimation procedures&#13;
because (a) of heterogeneity in products9 (b) the flow of servÂ½ces may nct&#13;
correspond to the stock of inputs9 (c) simultaneous equation bias;     (iii) if&#13;
there is a large random error on output, which there typically is, it may&#13;
be difficult to pick up the effect on output of inputs which contribute&#13;
relatively little towards total output. These statistical problems were&#13;
partly responsible for the fact that Layard et al. found that9 when labour&#13;
was disaggregated into five categories by quality it was impossible to&#13;
produce reasonable estimates of the separate contribution to production of&#13;
different types of labour.&#13;
Downtime&#13;
The productivity of personnel in.the US Navy was studied by Horowitz&#13;
and Sherman (1980) by examining the effects of personal characterisitcs,&#13;
including experience and training, on the operational availability of ships&#13;
in the US Navy.   The analysis was confined to 91 cruisers, destroyers and&#13;
frigates. The output of these ships could not be measured directly. But&#13;
the ability of the crew to keep vital equipment in working orcer is a crucial&#13;
intermediate product in the production of ship output. So the authors&#13;
focussed on the material condition of shipboard equipment. Wvthenever a ship&#13;
suffers an equipment failure that degrades its operational capacity it files&#13;
a casualty report. One measure of the material condition of the ship is the&#13;
number of caualties it has multiplied by the average time it takes to fix&#13;
them: this measure is termed downtime. Such downtime will d3epend on the&#13;
k nd of equipment, the age of the ship, the length of time since the ship&#13;
was last overhauled and the quantity and quality of men on board. Regression&#13;
analysis was used to estimate t'ie relationship between downtime due to shIp6&#13;
board failure and those factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87-&#13;
Horowitz and Sherman did not study downtime for entire ships but&#13;
concentrated on several sub-systems, chosen bec4use they are common to&#13;
a large number of ships and are maintained by men in a small number of&#13;
occupations. The sub-systems are: boilers, engines, gun systems, missile&#13;
systems, anti-submarine warfare systems and sonars. A further discussion&#13;
of the factors which influence downtime is given below.&#13;
Reduced turnover                                  t&#13;
One of the earliest studies of industrial training which used the firm as&#13;
the unit of observation is the fully fledged cost-benefit analysis of Thomas et al.&#13;
(1969). The study was carried out in a factory employing 200 people making&#13;
heavy duty clothes. Its original training scheme for machine operators, while&#13;
carried out in a training centre, had been fairly relaxed. The cost-benefit&#13;
study concerned the extra costs and benefits of t-he new scheme, which entailed&#13;
a thorough course of training for instructors, a detailed analysis of jobs and&#13;
the provision of a comprehensive training manual. The innovation was practised&#13;
for two years then dropped in favour of the old system. But when management&#13;
realised that the benefit-cost ratio of the new system was over 6-1 they re-&#13;
introduced the more rigorous new training scheme. Some benefits derived from&#13;
higher output relative to pay, but three quarters of the benefits associated&#13;
with the new scheme were attributable to a reduction in labour turnover giving&#13;
a longer average retention period.&#13;
Reduced inputs&#13;
Training may raise labour productivity or total factor productivity by&#13;
reducing the inputs required to produce a given output, rather than by&#13;
raising output for given inputs. In his study of a power station owned by&#13;
the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Shiba (1983) indicates that extra training&#13;
may reduce fuel inputs, repair costs and manpower requirements. He finds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that manpower economies were the major savings because operators have more&#13;
diverse skills and because more skilled labour means fewer accidnts and&#13;
failures.  The manpower economies associated with the training ia.ply a&#13;
benefit-cost ratio to the training of 8-lo&#13;
5.4 Pay, productivity and experience&#13;
A particular merit of studies at the level of the firm or piant is&#13;
that they permit us to examine the behaviour of experience-pay profiles and&#13;
experience-productivity profiles. This is important for (at least) two&#13;
reasons. First, human capital theory, which has come to dominate the&#13;
explaration of earnings in recent years, requires, approximately (on average),&#13;
equality in the net present value of earnings and productivity ever an&#13;
individual's tenure in the firm.   she evidence cited below provides a test&#13;
of this theory.  It will be shown that, on occasion, there is divergence&#13;
between pay and productivity at a point in time, sometimes pay exceeds&#13;
productivity and vice versa and, more important, there is no consistent evidence&#13;
of equality in net present values.   Second, and flowing from this first point,&#13;
rates of return to the firm and to society on resources comitted to training&#13;
may not always be correct if pay is used to measure vaiue product. W^hil'e&#13;
rates of return to the individual are unaffected, we may need to be more&#13;
cautious in drawing conclusions on t0e basis of the social or firimlevel&#13;
rate of return.  The relationship between experience-productivity profiles&#13;
and experience-pay profiles is examined by Medoff (1980) and Medoff and&#13;
Abraham (1981).   Their studies are important because they indicate that pay&#13;
is, for their sample at least, not always a good indicator of vh@ value of&#13;
output produced by the individual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89-&#13;
The Medoff and Abraham sample refers to 8,238 white, male, managerial&#13;
and professional employees at a major US corporation in the mid 1970's.&#13;
Each year 1973-77 the employee record included information on the employees&#13;
education, length of company service, date of birth, physical work location,&#13;
current job grade, date of entry into current job grade, current pay and&#13;
recent pay history and two measures of employee performance plus an assessment&#13;
of the employees potential for advancement. The information in the other&#13;
two company case studies (Medoff 1980) is similar and is not discussed here.&#13;
The authors present both cross section evidence and longitudinal evidence.&#13;
They proceed in three stages in the cross section work. First, they confirm&#13;
that pay rises with experience and, as expected, the payoff to current-company&#13;
experience is larger than to pre-company experience. Second, they determine&#13;
that substantial fraction of the positive pay-experience relationship occurs&#13;
within a grade, rather than solely because more experienced employees are&#13;
more likely to get promoted. This is a necessary step because the productivity&#13;
measure is performance rating and it must therefore refer to tasks of the&#13;
same difficulty. Finally they ask whether the experience-earnings differential&#13;
can be explained by an experience-performance differential. If more&#13;
experienced employees in a grade received higher pay because they are more&#13;
productive, the introduction of variables capturing relative within-grade&#13;
performance into the regression should move the within-grade-level returns&#13;
to experience towards zero - the performance measure(s) would "steal away"&#13;
the experience effect. In fact, when the performance measures are included&#13;
the returns to experience rise, they do not fall. Thus within grade pay rises&#13;
with experience, but productivity does not (see above). The concept of human&#13;
capital requires that oroductivity can be measured by pay. In general this&#13;
condition is probably met, but the Medoff work provides an interesting counter&#13;
example.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The longitudinal evidence is similar.   They examined, over a four&#13;
year period, within-grade movements in relative pay and relative performance-&#13;
rating. It was found that pay moves up but performance remains stable or&#13;
deteriorates so, again, the growth in (relative) earnings is not explained&#13;
by the growth in (relative) product'ivity.&#13;
Fuller (1976) used job performance, as rated by supervisors, in his&#13;
study of millers, turners and grinders in India. .He states thatr; basic pay&#13;
was sensitive to seniority (though there was only a small wage range for&#13;
workers in the same occupational category). But he finds that Job performance&#13;
is negatively related to experience after controlling for other factors such&#13;
as years of schooling and type of training. So, again, the pay-productivity&#13;
profiles are ruptured.&#13;
It is interesting to note, in passing, that, unexpectedly, the pay-&#13;
experience profile in the above two studies is positive and/or steeper than&#13;
the productivity-experience profile. Another firm-level case study is by&#13;
Ryar (1980). This too casts doubt on human capital theory, but in his firm&#13;
the productivity profile is steeper than the pay profile. Ryan's (7980)&#13;
study of arc welders in a US shipbuilding firm suggests that g!e experience-&#13;
pay profile and the experience-productivity profile guarantees the firm the&#13;
worst of all worlds.  The company bears the cost of training in a transferabkc&#13;
skill under conditions of high labour mobility.   Theory predicts that the&#13;
firm will experience a surplus of prospectivz trainees and a sh.ortage of&#13;
experienced workers.  These predictions are confirmed.   The ccmpany had&#13;
between five and ten applicants for every vacancy, As Ryan coc-mients "it is&#13;
hardly surprising that a long queue faced a firm which offered the&#13;
opportunity to learn a widely used skill without sacrifice of current income'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-&#13;
and "it is unlikely that a lower level of trainee pay would have eliminated&#13;
the excess supply of applicants". On the other ha'hd, the evidence points&#13;
to "the inadequacy of the supply of experienced welders" largely because&#13;
the shipyard pay was in the lower part of the pay distribution in the local&#13;
labour market. Even moderate values of the elasticity of supply would have&#13;
permitted the shipyard to reduce the costs of its welding operations by&#13;
raising the pay of mechanics (top welders), thereby effecting a more-than-&#13;
compensatory saving on training.&#13;
Clearly in its training of arc welders this shipyard does not accord&#13;
with the pay and productivity profiles over time - the sharing of training&#13;
costs and benefits - predicted by human capital theory. (But it might be&#13;
noted that, given the firm has got it wrong, subsequently the predictions&#13;
of human capital theory are amply borne out. Thefirm bears the cost of&#13;
the training and so is overwhelmed by the supply of prospective trainees.&#13;
It tries to recoup the cost of its (general) training by paying below the&#13;
going rate for that skill and so the skilled workers are very quit-prone).&#13;
One reason that the firm has wrong pay/productivity profiles for welders&#13;
is the constraint imposed by the internal labour market. Welders accounted&#13;
for only 28 per cent of the hourly workforce. It was not possible to raise&#13;
the pay of experienced welders alone because:&#13;
-    customary differentials and status rankings would be overthrown&#13;
by the adaption of welder pay to market conditions.&#13;
-    any increase in the wage rate for welders would be highly visible&#13;
because they move among many locations and work alongside a&#13;
number of different trades.&#13;
-    an increase in the pay of welders alone might have been acceptable&#13;
if other trades could have switched into welding, but this was&#13;
precluded by the high training costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-920&#13;
In fact, Ryan concludes that the least costly strategy, if relative job&#13;
rewards are indeed flexible, was to maintain the pay rates for skilled&#13;
welders and bear the burden of welder training.&#13;
If data on inputs are available for a nuinber of different D-ants a&#13;
production function can be used to check on the marginal product - wage&#13;
relationship.  Thus Layard et al.(1971) found a divergence between the&#13;
marginal product of labour and its twage in their study of plants in the&#13;
electrical engineering industry. Again, this is important because if pay&#13;
is used to calculate the social or firm rate of return the res2lts may&#13;
sometimes be misleadinq where pay and marginal product diverge,&#13;
5.5 Type of training and job performance/productivity&#13;
It is important to know not only how earnings are influenced by type&#13;
of training but also how job performance is related to training. Two firm-&#13;
level studies provide such information.&#13;
In the analysis of the job performance of miller, turners and grinders&#13;
in a firm in India Fuller (1976) found that workers with in-f,rm training -&#13;
both formal and informal    are more productive than workers from pre-employment&#13;
vocational institutes, even when schooling, trade experience a.nd socioeconomic&#13;
factors are controlled for. He states that if the proportion of workers wlth&#13;
organised in-firm training were increased from 48 per cent to 100 per cent&#13;
there would be a 5.4 per cent gain in worker e+ficiency.    Ful12r also presents&#13;
material on the interaction between schooling and training.    There are two&#13;
important findings.   First, irrespective of schooling level, i-.crkers with&#13;
in-employment training are more likely to achieve higher leve'.s of performance&#13;
than workers with pre-employment training. Second, extra schooling appears to&#13;
be an important pre-requisite for on-the-job learningo&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
In their study of downtime on ships in the US Navy Horowitz and Sherman&#13;
(1980) also discuss the training - productivity relationship. The acquisition&#13;
of certain advanced skills confers Navy Enlisted Classifications (NECs) on&#13;
individuals. Some NECs can be gained only by school attendance, others can&#13;
be learnt on the job. Unfortunately they do not present detailed results.&#13;
For boiler technicians there was clear evidence that the average number of&#13;
school related NECs per technicians is strongly (negatively) related to&#13;
downtime in both complicated two-plant 1,200 p.s.i. ships and one plant&#13;
ships. On two-plant 600 p.s.i. ships NEC training was not related to&#13;
downtime, but crew size was. This hints that, as we have come to expect,&#13;
skilled labour is complementary to complex physical capital while less&#13;
complicated physical capital often goes hand in hand with less skilled labour.&#13;
5.6 Summary&#13;
Firm level evaluationsof vocational training have been neglected. This&#13;
is a pity because they offer a fruitful area for such evaluations, as&#13;
demonstrated by the high standard of the published firm-level studies. On&#13;
the costs side it is fairly straighforward to measure the costs of formal&#13;
training. It is possible, but difficult, to get at foregone earnings:&#13;
though this may, in fact, be less of a problem than it initally appears&#13;
because in many cases firm-level training may imply no foregone earnings.&#13;
The most difficult cost element to measure is the cost to the firm from&#13;
informal training because this requires a measure of net trainee&#13;
output. On the benefits side a number of benefit measures have been used,&#13;
including: job performance, downtime, reduced turnover and reduced input&#13;
costs. If information is available on the costs and benefits of training&#13;
for a sample of firms these can be combined via a production function&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
although it seems unlikely, alas, that this method offers much scope yet&#13;
for evaluating occupational training, In some cases informaticn at the&#13;
level of the firm is available for both pay and productivity. 'luman&#13;
capital theory which underpins many training evaluations requires equality&#13;
in the net present values of output and earnings over the durakion of&#13;
tenure an individual spends in the firm. Such pay and productivity&#13;
information permits a test of the pay and productivity relationships,&#13;
vital if earnings are used to evaluate training.&#13;

PART II&#13;
EXTERNAL EFFICIENCY OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
SECTION 6&#13;
Earnings Based Benefit-Cost Evaluation of Vocational Training&#13;
The standard way of analysing the (external) efficiency of training&#13;
programmes is via the use of earnings data. In this section I consider the&#13;
objectives of training, the basic method of analysis, certain methodological&#13;
problems that exist even if we assume earnings are a good measure of the value&#13;
of output and the problems which arise when we relax that assumption. It must&#13;
be emphasised that "studies based on earnings represent the black box approach&#13;
to evaluation, they jump straight from training costs to money benefits and&#13;
miss out trainee reactions, learning, job behaviour and organisational effects"&#13;
(Drake 1982). We really need to go inside the black box and consider in detail,&#13;
for example, why earnings rise with experience or how we can choose between&#13;
instruction organised in different group sizes, expanded one way rather than&#13;
another and substituting capital for labour (Selby Smith 1970). In what follows&#13;
general principles are discussed first, then they are applied to the particular&#13;
instance of vocational training at the level of the firm.&#13;
6.1 Objectives and methods&#13;
Training programmes have three general objectives (Ashenfelter 1979, Bloch&#13;
1979). First, they aim to eliminate shortages of skilled workers via upgrading&#13;
from less skilled to more skilled status. Second, they aim to augment human&#13;
capital thereby raising the earnings and probability of employment of the&#13;
trainee. Third, they may be designed more on equity than efficiency grounds to&#13;
alleviate poverty or to reduce inequality. Clearly the major aim of corporate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o96-&#13;
vocational training is the first one    to overcome any shortage of skilled&#13;
labour, though such training may also have the wider aim of aumenting human&#13;
capital with a view to raising the earnings c? the trainee. Prosumably eqcity&#13;
considerations are of minor importance in any training associ ted with UorTlh&#13;
Bank projects.  Each of these three objectives require the tainLngs of tral'n`ng&#13;
participants to rises therefore "evaluating the success of trinn'ing programmes&#13;
is thus inherently a quantitative analysis of assessment of th2i offect of&#13;
training on trainee earnings" (Ashenfelter 1979 p.98).&#13;
Vocational training can be thought of under both a human capital and a&#13;
segmented/internal labour market heading,    Human capital empP.As!ses the&#13;
relationship between training and individual productivity- t6a social and&#13;
private rate of return to the investment in training is essentially the increase&#13;
in pay earned by a worker as a reselt of that training. Hal'* (1979) points out&#13;
that there is no reason to expect a high rate of return to pu)lic training&#13;
programmes (in a developed economy) bacause private investment in training should&#13;
have equated the return to training to the market Interest .ate     Presumably&#13;
World Bank training projects are required precisely bWcause p-,vate markets have&#13;
failed to produce the optimal amount of training.   The saegmeo  c6/lnternal labour&#13;
market view emphasises that the benefits of training proqpEmm,,!s arlse froim the,r&#13;
ability to move workers from one labour markot to anot;her   wi,   they are unlable&#13;
to do on their own.   Such training can be thought of as increasing mobility&#13;
between skills in the internal labour market of a firm.&#13;
Cost-benefit analyses of training us'7ng carnings can ?e {one or the&#13;
individual, the firm or for society.   'ypica'iiy the private            Isdividual is assumct&#13;
to be mainly interested in the earnings increment associate@t .ith the training&#13;
while the firm and society are interested In the extr&amp; output qenerated, whore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97-&#13;
the value of the extra output is assumed to be adequately measured by earnings&#13;
(this assumption is discussed at length below). There are five ways of&#13;
evaluating a training programme using earnings data. The first three methods&#13;
are given in Table 6.1. The other two methods are less familiar but very&#13;
useful in the context of training. The five methods are:&#13;
- present value of net benefits&#13;
-  rate of return&#13;
-  benefit - cost ratio&#13;
-  payback period&#13;
-  earnings differential required for x% rate of return&#13;
Naturally the general formulas presented In Table 5.1 have to be translated into&#13;
particular forms for training. Let us just take one example. Zymelman (1976&#13;
p.26) shows that the rate of return to in-plant training is given by solving the&#13;
equation below for r:&#13;
m  Ct+Wat Qat      n   QSt-WSt&#13;
___ = &#13;
t=l    (l+r)t     t=m+l  (l+r)t&#13;
where Ct    =  cost of training a worker over a unit of time t&#13;
Wat  =  wage rate of trainee during t&#13;
Qat  =  value of production attributable to a trainee during t&#13;
Wst  =  wage rate of a skilled worker during t&#13;
Qst  =  value of production attributable to a skilled worker during t&#13;
r   =  rate of return&#13;
t   =  time subscript&#13;
m   =   length of training period&#13;
n   =  length of time the skilled worker remains in the firm.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99-&#13;
Particular issues such as how to get at the value of production attributable&#13;
to trainees and skilled workers are discussed below. The payback period&#13;
method is based on the present value of net benefits and simply asks how&#13;
many years are necessary (i.e. what value of t) for discounted benefits of&#13;
training to equal (discounted if appropriate) costs.&#13;
The required earnings differential is specially valuable when incomplete&#13;
data on benefits exist. Say that a country wishes the investment to yield a&#13;
10 per cent rate of return, the formula is:&#13;
Required differential&#13;
=   10&#13;
Training          Foregone&#13;
instruction cost   +  earnings&#13;
where data exist for the denominator and you solve for the numerator. This&#13;
seems a particularly valuable way of thinking simply about Bank-financed&#13;
training. Cost data will typically be available. The required return is&#13;
presumably known by the World Bank or recipient country. The "required&#13;
differential" for the trained person can then be compared with known facts&#13;
about the pay structure to see whether investment in firm-level training, in&#13;
general or in a particular form, is worthwhile.&#13;
Less than complete information on costs and benefits still permits&#13;
helpful evaluations of the external efficiency of different types of training.&#13;
Cost effectiveness analysis concentrates on the cost of achieving a given&#13;
outcome. For example, if a certain amount of trained labour is required to&#13;
work in a power station in a developing country is it more cost effective to&#13;
get the trained labour from abroad or to undertake the required training&#13;
locally? If the training is to be provided locally, cost effectiveness&#13;
analysis indicates, for example, the relative merits of institutional versus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
"loo-&#13;
firm-based training. There is no question o? trying to estlmato a rate of&#13;
return to particular types of training.   Cost offectiveness ana`ysis is much&#13;
more straightforward: it simply analyses the d[Tfferent costs of achieving a&#13;
given objective.&#13;
6.2  Methodological problems&#13;
Making the assumption that earnings measure output satisfactorily,&#13;
there are still a number of difficult methodological problems to be faced dn&#13;
any study which purports to calculate the cost effectiveness or rate of return&#13;
(or other summary indicator) using earnings data.   These problerms include:&#13;
sample size, the comparison group, the use of longitudinal 6ata, and the impact&#13;
of labour mobility on the estimates. Any evaluation of corporate training&#13;
using earnings would need to consider each of these problems. ",he even&#13;
thornier black box issue   whether earnings measure output    Is discussed&#13;
later.&#13;
Sample size&#13;
The sample size must be suffIciently larue to obtain "smal"' standard&#13;
errors of the estimated impact of the programme (ef. Ehrenberg 1979, Conlisk&#13;
1979, Stafford 1979, Pitcher 1979). The generalily accepted provedure is:&#13;
Â°  ask what level of programme benefits are required for th.e, benefit/&#13;
cost ratio of the programme to equal L,inity&#13;
Â°  then determine the sample size nocessEry to allow us to estlmate&#13;
such an impact (if it exists) at any pro-determined leve5l of&#13;
statistical significance.&#13;
If the earnings variable has a high varianca then, a large szmz;1e sizx is&#13;
required to detect a small anticipated effect o'r the training.  (his may be&#13;
less of an issue for corporate vocational training because the earnings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-&#13;
variable will surely have less variance than, for example the variance is&#13;
earnings among those who go through Government manpower programmes (and&#13;
their comparison groups) in the U.S.&#13;
Control groups&#13;
The most controversial methodological issue concerns the control group.&#13;
Consider these views:&#13;
the principal methodogical division in effectiveness analysis is&#13;
still the choice between assessing training effects by measuring&#13;
attainments in an experimental and control group, and using one group&#13;
as its own control ... At the level of the firm or the industry, most&#13;
evaluators have been overwhelmed by the practical difficulties of a&#13;
control group approach" (Drake 1982 p.119).&#13;
"Evaluation research in the manpower area still remains as much an art&#13;
as a science, with no well defined and generally accepted best practice&#13;
... There are some well-defined worst practices, however. For example,&#13;
simple before after comparisons without any comparison group, are&#13;
definitely frowned upon" (Ehrenberg 1979 pp.157-8).&#13;
Thus in corporate vocational training are the trainees to be their own control&#13;
group by analysing their earnings before and after training or are their&#13;
before and after earnings to be compared with those of a control group?&#13;
If we study participants only, by analysing their earnings before and&#13;
after training, we may get spuriously large programme effects. In general,&#13;
there are three reasons for this. First, with wage inflation, individual&#13;
earnings tend to increase over time in nominal terms. Second, real earnings&#13;
rise as workers gain experience with time. Both these reasons apply to&#13;
corporate training. Third, the trainee may have transitorily low earnings&#13;
immediately before training. This is likely to apply in the case of public&#13;
manpower programmes which take unemployed people but is less relevant for&#13;
corporate training, which will often be designed for current employees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-&#13;
Where do we get the comparison group to ensure that general Changes in&#13;
earnings are not taken to be the effects of training? in a cjassAcal sample&#13;
design some fraction of a training prograne's applicants woul6 be ran6omiy&#13;
assigned to training while the remainder would bg reservd as a comparison&#13;
group.  This can only be done If there is an excess supply to the training&#13;
programme. Possible alternative controls inOiude what Bloch (7979) Calls&#13;
"partial programme participants" such as Individuals selected for the training&#13;
but who did not show up to take it (no-shows), drop-outs, interested non-&#13;
enrolees and qualified non-applicants.&#13;
Alternatively, the trainee and comparison groups can be drawn from&#13;
different populations, then we control statistically for differences between&#13;
the two groups. To do this we need to specify an earnings function that touvd&#13;
prevail for both groups in the absence of the training progracmne.   For example&#13;
Keifer (1979) specifies the following earni-ngs function:&#13;
y = b0 + b, Age + b2 Education + b3 Marriage + b    particpant    -O  Tinns&#13;
Keifer ran this for 3 quarters before training and 3 quarters after training.&#13;
The impact of training is the coefficient b4 which indicates whether or not&#13;
the individual has participated in the training prograwium  plus the coeffIciant&#13;
b5 evaluated at mean weeks of training.   Thus he ends up with information like&#13;
this:&#13;
Quarters  bcfore  t aining     Quarters   fteGr  trAs'ining&#13;
3        2        $                    2        3&#13;
Pay differential: those&#13;
with over those without             dollars                       dollars&#13;
training (b4 + b5)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103-&#13;
In a related paper (Keifer 1979a) confirms that this sample must include&#13;
training and non-training individuals and must span pre-training and post-&#13;
training periods. Evaluation results will be "misleading" if the returns&#13;
are estimated only from (i) a post-training comparison of earnings between&#13;
trainees and non-trainees or (ii) a before-after comparison of earnings of&#13;
trainees alone.&#13;
It is straightforward to use the results from the quarters after training&#13;
to do an inverted cost-benefit analysis. Say the cost of training per&#13;
participant is $1,000. Therefore an annual $100 perpetual earnings differential&#13;
is required for discounted benefits to equal costs using a discount rate of&#13;
ten per cent. We can then examine the pay differential associated with training&#13;
to see if the required differential is achieved. It would be a straightforward&#13;
matter to do this for Bank-financed corporate training.&#13;
There are a number of problems with these earnings functions. First, the&#13;
maintained hypothesis is that the earnings generating functions are of the same&#13;
form for the trainees and the comparison group (Ashenfelter 1979). Second, it&#13;
is possible that, in the jargon, participation in training is endogenous: we&#13;
require training to be the cause of the rise in earnings rather than a decline&#13;
in earnings being the cause of entry into the training programme. Third, the&#13;
functions are normally linear, but need not be. Probably none of these problems&#13;
are particularly important for corporate training.&#13;
The comparison between the control group and the trainees need not be done&#13;
via a statistical analysis using individual data. Instead the earnings of the&#13;
two groups can be averaged and comparisons made between these aggregate profiles&#13;
(cf Colley et al. 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104-&#13;
Not all studies, of course, use a separate comparison group. Rather the&#13;
control group can be the pre-programme participants. Kaitz (1979), for example,&#13;
uses no controls but instead presents a Markov process of the pre- and post-&#13;
programme labour force experience of the trainees. Ideally, an evaluation of&#13;
corporate training using earnings data would use a control group but the before/&#13;
after method using longitudinal data would probably not be very misleading&#13;
especially if the trainees are current employees of the firm.&#13;
Longitudinal data&#13;
For many employment and earnings problems "observing the characteristics&#13;
of a given individual at different points in time has considerable analytical&#13;
advantages" (Psacharopoulos 1981 p.744). In particular other things are held&#13;
equal, true lifetime profiles can be constructed, vintage effects of education&#13;
and training can be controlled for, and the impact of a particular labour&#13;
market state (say whether unemployed) on future states (say future unemployment&#13;
and sickness) can be examined. In the particular case of training longitudinal&#13;
data are specially valuable. It is necessary to track trainees over long&#13;
enough time to measure the full intertemporal impact of training to see how&#13;
rapidly the impact depreciates, or appreciates, with time. Earnings depreciate&#13;
if training does not permanently alter the capability of the individual but&#13;
simply has a placement effect. The effect appreciates 'over time if training&#13;
allows individuals to qualify for jobs which offer investment opportunities,&#13;
in which case the trainees post-training earnings will be temporarily low and&#13;
then grow rapidly over time, perhaps due to promotion. Another way of thinking&#13;
about this is to say that training has a permanent effect due to the increase&#13;
in human capital and a transitory effect, due to placement, which will disappear&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

after a few years. Johnson (1979 p.249) makes this point vividly: "The use&#13;
of observed earnings during the first year after the programme is about as&#13;
reliable as choosing from a table of random numbers" and the problematic&#13;
nature of immediate post-training earnings is confirmed by Gay and Borus (1980).&#13;
The importance of earnings data on trainees and a comparison group both&#13;
before and after training was emphasised in Section 3. In the absence of an&#13;
experimental design where individuals are randomly assigned between trainee&#13;
and control groups the process of selection into the training programme may&#13;
be highly correlated with unobservable factors which also help determine&#13;
earnings. This can be overcome in either of two ways if longitudinal data&#13;
are available. First, a fixed effects model estimates an earnings function&#13;
prior to training and an earnings function post training and then differences&#13;
them. This causes the unobservable factors to net out leaving the change in&#13;
earnings pre/post training to be a function of participation in the training&#13;
programme. The second possibility is what is called an autoregressive model.&#13;
In this case pre-training earnings are used to capture the unobservable&#13;
factors which influence pay.   Again, this makes it more likely that the pure&#13;
impact of training on earnings will be captured. By contrast, if no&#13;
longitudinal data exist it is less likely that the investigator will be able&#13;
to calculate this pure training participation effect.&#13;
In general, of course, longitudinal data is not available. This raises&#13;
interesting practical and theoretical issues for training evaluations. Cohen&#13;
(1983) overcame the problem by constructing his own longitudinal data. In&#13;
his study of industrial training in Malaysia he had information on post&#13;
training earnings and on the average earnings of skilled workers. He simply&#13;
assumes that it will take twenty years for the earnings of the newly-minted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
r106-&#13;
trainee to reach the level of the skilled wcrker. In calculating the&#13;
corporate rate of return he then uses the wedge between the (gradully rising)&#13;
earnings of the trainee and the higher (stable) earnings of the skilled wtsorker&#13;
as the measure of the benefits of training. Xt would certainly be possible&#13;
to replicate this method in any corporate traing study.      But there is a real&#13;
problem with the hidden assumptions In Cohen's method.    It is not clear how&#13;
the firm is able to pay the Individual below his/her value to -Ze firm for as&#13;
long as twenty years.   Surely the individual would quit in thesa circumstances.&#13;
Cohen's method is only legitimate if training is truly specifico N!ote that&#13;
the method of construction of the longitudinaO data affects the private and&#13;
social rate of return as well as the corporate rate.&#13;
The theoretical issue is described in F dgTe 6.1 (see Levine ( . 979) for&#13;
an application of this to Xsrael). Individual 7 has less years of formal&#13;
schooling/training than individual 2 and "           lenvoÂ§ts  less in on-Oehe-job traiynng&#13;
i.e. the gap between actual and potential earnings on entry to the labour&#13;
force is small for individual 1 and big for individual 2. X? we 2have no&#13;
longitudinal data , we may observe earnings at t which might (for example)&#13;
be 4 years after entry to the labour force for individual 1 and 3 years&#13;
after entry for individual 2.   Just at that pqqnt actual earnings are&#13;
identical, therefore in an analysis w   would observe enoSlgn'&gt;?icant effects&#13;
on different training lengths/methods. But the present values of the earnings&#13;
streams could be very different:   either individual 9 or 1ndsiv`dual 2 might&#13;
have a higher present value of stream of futurc earnings.    TtQs if We have&#13;
no full longitudinal data W@e are liable to reach wrong conclusions on the&#13;
efficiency of training duration and methods.&#13;

One way to get longitudinal data is by tracer or foilow-ue stu6les. Tn&#13;
her recent survey of such studies liiiowitz (1983) concluded  ht  they "are&#13;
an important supply-side-instrument for assessing the efctcivc&lt;ness of existMg&#13;
training programmes and modifying them "n rsÂ¢onsc to sign0s '!prom the aÂ¢e8&#13;
market or for planning new programmes` (p.3). The design of s&amp;:ch follow uo&#13;
studies needs careful thought   (cf Morell IS97).    Essbntially "hey can eithe&#13;
follow one cohort for a considerable period o4 time or they got information aft&#13;
a single point in time on more than one cohort of past trn-nin9 graducates.   At&#13;
leasfs six States in the US use loca, follow-Up evaluations of&lt; vocationai&#13;
programmes for state level planning (see for example Brown and Kiefer 1980).&#13;
Tracer studies generally collect longitud`;nal 61ata on earnings but Holowitx&#13;
lists many other indicators of the outcome of training pragTamfiles   efmployment&#13;
rate- length of waiting time before first job is found;     job 'nobility;  d3gree&#13;
to which training is actually used on the job; employer satisfaction with the&#13;

attitudes toward the training programme; an6 attitudes of programme admlnis-&#13;
trators and teachers regarding trai?nee performance both during and post-&#13;

Labour mobility and training compfeton rate&#13;
The individual is simply interested in his training costs and benefits.&#13;
But if we estimate the social or corporate rIAte of return othcjr matters nee@d&#13;
to be considered. First, not everyone will comp@otn the training. For exampte&#13;
Borus (1977) reports the followiig compltion rates for differrnit nodes of&#13;
vocational training in Israel:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-&#13;
% of entrants graduating&#13;
short courses                                85&#13;
industrial schools                           80&#13;
vocational secondary schools                 67&#13;
apprenticeships                              55&#13;
Thus costs to the firm and to society should reflect the costs incurred on&#13;
behalf of those who do not complete.&#13;
On the benefit side there is also the issue of labour mobility, among&#13;
firms, occupations and even countries. For the corporate rate of return the&#13;
retention rate of trained labour is crucially important. For given costs&#13;
incurred by the firm, the return will be higher the longer the firm is able&#13;
to gather the wedge between the value of output produced by the trainee and&#13;
what it pays him. For example, Thomas et al. (1969) found that three quarters&#13;
of the benefits of a systematic new training system inside a textile firm came&#13;
from reduced labour turnover and only one quarter from higher productivity.&#13;
For society it matters less how long the individual stays in a particular firm.&#13;
But if he switches firms it does matter whether he is in the same occupation -&#13;
whether the training is actually being used (though if it is not being used it&#13;
is a complicated matter to adjust benefits). If the individual migrates&#13;
outside the country the social returns to the training will naturally be lower,&#13;
but even here the issue is not straightforward. Thanks to training, he might&#13;
migrate from a low wage country to a high wage country and the currency&#13;
remittances to the original country could be scored as a benefit.&#13;

6.3 Earnings and output&#13;
Drake (1982) stated   " ... measuring the contribution of training to&#13;
effectiveness at work has frequently baffled investigators. Some have fallen&#13;
back on the heroic assumption that wages are an 'approximate but sufficient&#13;
measure of the productivity of trained manpower ..        The methodological&#13;
problems discussed above exist even if that heroic assumption holds. But&#13;
does it?  There are (at least) three sets of reasons why earnings may not&#13;
measure the value of output.   First, non-competitive or non-compensating&#13;
factors may influence pay structures. Second, externalities drive a wedge&#13;
between private and social values. Third, the labour market may not be in&#13;
equilibrium. Each set of reasons will be examined in turn. If (differences in)&#13;
earnings cannot be-justified on efficiency grounds then labour may get&#13;
mis-allocated and estimated social rates of return mav not alwavc hp&#13;
correct.&#13;
Non-competitive labour market&#13;
Orthodox competitive theory has been challenged in recent years by the&#13;
twin concepts of segmented and internal labour markets. Both these concepts&#13;
are important to us.   Under the internal labour market, the firm sets its own&#13;
pay rules, possibly insulating the employees fromthe external labour market.&#13;
Under the segmented labour market individuals who work in so-called primary&#13;
firms - with for example large plants, high capital : labour ratios and high&#13;
unionisation - may earn more than those who work in the so-called secondary&#13;
segment of the labour market.    Four dimensions of non-competitive labour&#13;
markets are analysed: the relationship between pay, productivity and&#13;
experience;  the role of ability-to-pay factors; discrimination; and&#13;
administered labour markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-111-&#13;
Pay - productivity and experience. There are many possible reasons why&#13;
pay rises over the lifetime of an individual, independent of real earnings&#13;
growth (cf. Brown 1983). First, under the human capital theory pay mirrors&#13;
productivity and productivity depends positively on schooling or post-school&#13;
training. And post-school training diminishes over time because of the&#13;
finiteness of life or because of rising opportunity costs. On this theory&#13;
wages increase with experience. Other theories play down the spot equality&#13;
between wages and productivity. For example Lazear (1981) suggests that the&#13;
earnings profile may rise more steeply than the productivity profile to&#13;
discourage malfeasance (shirking) among workers. Alternatively the pay&#13;
and productivity profiles may diverge to discourage "movers" from seeking&#13;
employment in the firm. Another possibility put forward by Harris and&#13;
Holmstrom (1982) is that the steeper wage profile may reflect implicit&#13;
insurance arrangements between workers and firms in which ex post wage&#13;
increases are related to ex ante productivity but are uncorrelated with&#13;
ex post productivity within skill groups.&#13;
The work reported in Section 5 by Fuller (1976), Medoff (1981), Medoff&#13;
and Abraham (1980) and Ryan (1980) attempts to test the underlying assumption&#13;
of human capital theory that earnings measure value product (see Figure 6.2).&#13;
Medoff found that within-grade pay was positively related to experience but&#13;
there was no such relationship between productivity and experience. His&#13;
productivity measure was job performance, as assessed by the supervisor.&#13;
Ryan found that the wage-experience profile for arc welders in a US shipyard&#13;
was flatter than the productivity-experience schedule and welders - a general&#13;
skill - had, not surprisingly, high post-training quit rates. (Although this&#13;
clearly conflicts with the predictions of human capital theory some care is&#13;

needed in interpreting Ryan's results. The firm, apparently, was aware that&#13;
it should, essentially, have a steeper pay profile in order to retain its&#13;
welders. But higher pay for skilled welders would have disrupted the&#13;
(horizontal) pay differentials between welders and other skilled craftsmen.&#13;
In one sense therefore, given that the pay structure forces "artificially"&#13;
low pay for skilled welders the prediction of human capital theory is&#13;
therefore confirmed). Any evaluation of corporate training must attempt to&#13;
check whether pay is an adequate measure of the value of output. If it is&#13;
not then both the corporate and the social rate of return will be either&#13;
overstated or understated.&#13;
Recently Brown (1983) has suggested that there is evidence that may&#13;
indicate a substantially greater role for on-the-job training in explaining&#13;
wage growth than that suggested by the Medoff and Abraham study. This&#13;
evidence is contained in the Michigan Panel Survey of Income Dynamics, which&#13;
in Waves nine (1976) and eleven (1978) asked respondents the following&#13;
question: "On a job like yours, how long would it take the average new&#13;
person to become fully trained and qualified?". Using the answer to this&#13;
question along with corresponding information on tenure in current position,&#13;
it is possible to identify those employees who are currently in training, as&#13;
well as the cumulative time spent training for each employee. This&#13;
information permits more precise measurement of differences among individuals&#13;
in the extent of on-the-job training and its effect on wages. If explanations&#13;
of wage growth that do not rely on the growth in productivity associated with&#13;
more human capital are correct, then we should expect to observe wage growth&#13;
after the point in time when people become fully trained in their current&#13;
Dositions. Alternatively, if the human capital on-the-job training model is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
correct we should expect to observe wage growth associated wi   crainng.&#13;
The potential relevance of alternative models -in explaining l1,etime wage&#13;
growth might therefore be judged according to the fraction of .-bserved wage&#13;
growth explained by on-the-job training in comparison with thoe fraction that&#13;
remainsfor other factors. Brown finds that there is very litt7e discernab"n&#13;
wage growth in the absence of training. Of the wage growth triat is observed&#13;
during or on completion of training, onlv a small part appears attributabqe&#13;
to factors other than training.  In the Michigan Panel Survey data,&#13;
individuals' wages typically increase over time either through promotion to&#13;
a higher-paying position, which also involves training. WithTn a civen&#13;
position, however, individuals experience very l1ittle, if any, wage growth&#13;
after their training has been completed.  Further, training appears to have&#13;
effects on wages that are comparable to the effects of school`in. Brown&#13;
concludes "Thus, these data suggest that onÂ°the-job training plays an important&#13;
role in determining wage growth. The data also suggest that m,odeis whic&#13;
imply wage growth subsequent to training have little such wag^ growth to&#13;
explain, and so are probably not relevant to the data' (pO7)0   Ksscntially&#13;
what Brown is saying is that the Medoff and Abraham result refers to a&#13;
particular case study and does not hold up with a much larger sample.&#13;
However, for the human capital model -clearly favoured by Broe^3n - to be&#13;
fully validated it is also necessary that training raises prcductivity.&#13;
It is quite possible that, instead, the training period is nothing more than&#13;
a testing or probationary period.   fo confirm the human capiKval model it iS&#13;
necessary to show that the present value of the productivity profile&#13;
associated with training is coincident with the present va'uM of the wage&#13;
profile. This is something we know rather little abouto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115-&#13;
Psacharopoulos (1983) examined the relationship between pay and&#13;
productivity - related characteristics separately for the private sector and&#13;
public sector across six countries (UK, Greece, Portugal, Brazil, Colombia,&#13;
Malaysia). The effect of education on earnings is stronger in the private&#13;
sector, a finding "to be interpreted as a recognition of the high productivity&#13;
of the educated where profit matters" (p.128). Thus. in the private sector&#13;
"the education level seems to have a productivity counterpart" but such an&#13;
association is, by implication, less evident in the public sector. Therefore&#13;
evaluation of vocational training using earnings may be more difficult the&#13;
larger the number of public sector employees in the sample.&#13;
Ability to pay. Three recent studies of developing countries which throw&#13;
light on the issue of whether pay reflects competitive factors such as schooling,&#13;
experience, training or non-competitive ability to pay factors such as (other&#13;
things equal) capital intensity, concentration, firm size, unionisation and&#13;
per se foreign ownership are analysed. The results are summarised in Table 6.2.&#13;
In the Kenya and Malaysia studies the relevant pay structure is inter-firm or&#13;
inter-industry and pay across firms or industries is regressed on various&#13;
characteristics of these firms or industries. The Tanzania study, by contrast,&#13;
focusses on the determination of individual earnings. Knight and Sabot (1983)&#13;
use 1971 pay information on 660 employees in 24 manufacturing firms to estimate&#13;
an earnings function for Tanzania. They find that at least 87 per cent of the&#13;
total explained variance is accounted for by the (competitive) personal&#13;
variables such as schooling years and experience. The variables which capture&#13;
the characteristics of the firms the individual's work in are much less&#13;
important in explaining earnings than are personal characteristics. Nevertheless,&#13;

some of these firm variables are significantly associated with individual&#13;
pay: firm size, the skill-intensity inside the firm and foreign ownership&#13;
are all positively related to pay, while unionisation is associated with a&#13;
lower level of pay. Two other variables included to capture ability to&#13;
pay - capital intensity and profitability - were not associated with&#13;
individual earnings. This all leads the authors to conclude that "the&#13;
evidence basically supports the competitive labour market paradigm (but)&#13;
the market is by no means perfectly competitive" (p.64).&#13;
The Kenya study examined the wage contracts of unskilled labour in&#13;
some 100 firms around 1970. There is clear evidence that ability to pay&#13;
factors play their part: concentration levels, plant size and profitability&#13;
are all positively related to earnings, though the degree of unionisation in&#13;
the firm is unrelated to pay. The authors speculate that the three significant&#13;
ability to pay variables may be picking up the effect of foreign ownership.&#13;
However, it is also possible that profitable, large firms in concentrated&#13;
industries have a far more skilled labour force. Thus it is not possible to&#13;
conclude definitely that pay does not measure the true value of the individual&#13;
to the firm or to society although there is a hint that this is the case.&#13;
Such evidence is certainly in line with that of the ILO (1972) which, drawing&#13;
on the notion of the segmented labour market, emphasised the rigidity of the&#13;
Kenya pay structure and its failure to respond to growing supply pressures.&#13;
However, a recent study (Collier and Bigsten 1981) has suggested that the ILO&#13;
were wrong. The authors argue that despite a substantial increase in the&#13;
demand for labour real wages fell very rapidly in the mid 1970s " ... the&#13;
conclusion which emerges is the flexibility of the labour market ... The view&#13;
that real wages are rigid is simply wrong" (p.43). If this latter study is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o~ll8o&#13;
definitive then any evaluation of training usIng earnings data Â°s quIfte in&#13;
order and will not be misleading on this score.    But if the  1-0 and House&#13;
and Rempel studies are correct great caution is required if suth earnings&#13;
information is used.&#13;
Lim (1977) studied the inter-firm and inter Industry pay strucutCure for&#13;
the manufacturing sector in Malaysia.   He had pay data for 35. esta5iishment',S&#13;
For part of his analysis he aggregated this firm-level pay in',rmaicton to&#13;
4-digit (n = 59) and 3 digit (n = 23) industrylevel.     Lim was part'icularly&#13;
interested in whether foreign companies pay higher wages than their 'loca!&#13;
counterparts in Malaysian manufacturing.    And, if so, whether this is because&#13;
they employ workers of higher quality or because of foreign ownership per se,&#13;
Lim had two wage variables, basic hourly pay, and gross hourly pay which&#13;
includes fringe benefits like subsidies on food, transport, Clothing and&#13;
medicine.   191 of his establishments were entcirely Malay otmed, lii are&#13;
entirely foreign owned and 42 have mixed owmerhsip.    Essentially Lam found&#13;
that the amount of capital and its utilisation were the factors most&#13;
importantly associated with basic pay and he suggested that these are&#13;
characteristics associated with foreign ownership. However, such capitail&#13;
intensive firms and industries will probably neod high quality labour and&#13;
he was not able to control for the skill composition across his sample.     rt^hen&#13;
he examined gross pay he found that foreign ownership conferretd a pay&#13;
differential of around 10 per cent even controlling for the other factors&#13;
like capital. This hints that any evaluation which failed to take account ol'&#13;
the foreign ownership-earnings relationship might overstate Â½.'n benefits o';&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11 9-&#13;
Clearly, it is not possible to generalise on the basis of three studies.&#13;
It seems likely, however, that competitive factors play a key role in&#13;
determining earnings but that, in addition, ability-to-pay factors play their&#13;
part. Although evaluations using earnings are unlikely to be misleading&#13;
thought needs to be given to the errors which creep in if ability-to-pay&#13;
factors are important.&#13;
Discrimination. If (say, comparing a man and a woman) productive&#13;
characteristics are identical but earnings are different this suggests that pay&#13;
is not properly measuring economic worth. (If male pay is greater than female&#13;
pay we do not know whether male pay is overstating economic worth or whether&#13;
female pay is understating it). Recently there has been a revealing study of&#13;
the distribution of individual earnings among nearly 1000 individuals by race&#13;
and by sex in Tanzania (Knight and Sabot 1982). The authors considered three&#13;
sets of factors which influence pay between sex and race group:&#13;
- productive personal characteristics like schooling and experience&#13;
- differences in pay within an occupation, holding personal characteristics&#13;
constant&#13;
-  differences-in occupational attainment, holdingc'cnaracteristics constant&#13;
The premium paid to males is explained almost entirely by differences between&#13;
males and females in economic characteristics. Men and women with the same&#13;
level of education, employment experience, formal training and other personal&#13;
characteristics receive roughly the same pay.&#13;
But the findings on race are contrary to what one might expect. After&#13;
standardising for differences in economic characteristics Asians earn a net&#13;
premium in excess of the mean wage of Africans. This is not because the authors&#13;
understate the productive characteristics of Asians - they earn the largest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
premiums in the manual occupations where unmneasurd human capi0Oa' is likely&#13;
to have the least impact on productivity. If such results are '.ypical any&#13;
study which used earnings to measure the value of output would ?e misleading.&#13;
Administered labour markets.   Xn Bank-f-inanced tra`hing t     rn^ f wrm Wii&#13;
often behave as if training is specifiC and thoy will pay admini stered wages.&#13;
But sometimes the trained person wi,K leave v o use his or her newly acquired&#13;
skill in another firm,9 implying the training is general. Such an&#13;
administered pay system implies non-compet'ItIve pay determinatOn and9&#13;
therefore, less correspondence between pay and productivity than occurs&#13;
with competition.&#13;
The four dimensions of the non-competitive labour market suggest that&#13;
the results of training evaluations may somet-ir.s be imprecise if earnings&#13;
are used to measure the value of output.   The first dimiension9 the pay-&#13;
productivity-experience nexus inside the firm is probably th e :,cst pressing&#13;
problem. This is because in any before and after study (with or without a&#13;
separate control group) a person is likely to be paid too much or too little&#13;
on grounds of ability to pay of discrimination both before and after&#13;
training. Thus the "after" earnings of the ovre skilled perscn may well&#13;
reflect the impact of training as compared vwit"h the "before" earnings of the&#13;
less skilled person. However9 the first problem may wo'll be uoiquitous:&#13;
we simply do not know what goes on inside thn black box and it emphasises&#13;
the key importance of an understanding of the internal labour .,market in any&#13;
evaluations including, for example, analysis of the vertical ' ,,y structure&#13;
between skilrled and unskilled workers in the same craft and tin horizontal&#13;
structure among different crafts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-&#13;
If these non-competitive factors are held to dominate pay structures&#13;
a different approach to estimating corporate and social rates of return is,&#13;
conceptually, possible to estimate the rate of return to training. A cross&#13;
section production function using plants as the unit of observation can be&#13;
estimated including a number of different indicators of labour equality.&#13;
The marginal product of these different labour types can then be calculated&#13;
and those estimates can be used to calculate the corporate and social rate of&#13;
return.  However, this approach is difficult.    First, cross section data on a&#13;
number of plants is needed, bringing with it profound aggregation problems.&#13;
Second, it is unlikely that more than two or three types of labour can be&#13;
included in the production function and such an aggregate treatment of&#13;
different labour types rather defeats the purpose of estimating the production&#13;
function.&#13;
Externalities&#13;
Externality questions have bedevilled attempts to estimate the social&#13;
rate of return to Government manpower programmes. There are two particularly&#13;
important sets of problems. First, how displacement, replacement and&#13;
complementarity are to be handled. Second, and flowing from the first, how&#13;
the shadow price of labour is to be treated. These will be considered in turn.&#13;
Displacement, replacement and complementarity. Displacement and replacement&#13;
affect the social rate of return but not the corporate or private return to&#13;
training. Displacement occurs when a well paying job that is filled by a recent&#13;
graduate of a training programme might have been filled by someone else. Thus&#13;
the training programme participant displaces an incumbent member of the relevant&#13;
labour market. In this case the observed earnings of the trained person less&#13;
the observed earnings of a randomly selected control group person represents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 22-&#13;
an overstatement of the actual increase in total output due to the programme&#13;
essentially all the programme achieves is a Teshuffling of available job&#13;
opportunities. Presumably displacement ought not to occur under Banx financo6&#13;
corporate training. The very purpose of such training is because there Is&#13;
insufficient labour of the requisite skill-type and therefore the trained person&#13;
is not displacing anyone else.&#13;
Replacement occurs when the r'emoval of the trainee (to be trained) has no&#13;
opportunity cost because the job vacated is now filled by someone else, who may&#13;
have been unemployed    so there is no loss in output in the economy as a&#13;
whole. In this case the social rate of return to the tralning can be greater&#13;
than the private rate of return. In much corporate train"ng replacement in&#13;
the sense described will not take place, but there are related ;roblems.&#13;
Certainly there may be no loss in output or in earnings while the individual&#13;
is undergoing training. Further, if the trainee gets promoted he vacates a&#13;
job lower down and ultimately such a trickle-down process may lend to a&#13;
previously unemployed person being hired. Thus the replacement question needs&#13;
careful thought in any social rate of return analysis of corporate training.&#13;
Complementarity occurs when solving one skill shortage permits employment&#13;
elsewhere to rise when previously it had been held back bccaus2 there was&#13;
insufficient skilled labour,   This will affect the corporate as well as the&#13;
social rate of return.&#13;
Shadow price of labour. C  Whei we compare In plant apprenticeship training&#13;
with vocational schools in tems of social costs, typically th'? forogone&#13;
earnings of those who attend vocational schools are scored "arger than foregone&#13;
earnings of the apprentice.   But if thern 'iS a 'large pool of unamployed labour&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-124-&#13;
apprentices temporarily and a study done at such a time would show high returns&#13;
to apprentice training compared (say) with vocational school training, but&#13;
such high returns would only be transitory.&#13;
Present values versus cross sections. The,human capital model essentially&#13;
predicts equality (on average) between the present value of earnings and of&#13;
marginal products over the duration of tenure in the firm. But there need not&#13;
be equality at all points in the profiles. For example with firm-specific&#13;
training pay may exceed value product during training and vice versa later.&#13;
Or if the aim is to cut labour turnover the pay-experience profile may be&#13;
steeper than the pay-value product profile. Therefore, for any individual&#13;
pay may certainly not measure the value of his output at a point in time&#13;
which may cause problems for the social and corporate returns. But, if&#13;
there is an adequate sample of individuals by experience the positive and&#13;
negative wedges between pay and output should average themselves out, so&#13;
minimising this problem.&#13;
Non-competitive labour markets, externalities and disequilibrium each&#13;
counsel caution if corporate or social rates of return to vocational training&#13;
*are calculated using earnings data. As Hilowitz (1983 p.42) puts it " ... if&#13;
earnings levels are used as a proxy for the graduate's productivity and his&#13;
usefulness to his employer (and to society) this must be done in a limited&#13;
context where the underlying assumptions are carefully stated ... Too often&#13;
facile and unstated assumptions have lead to facile calculations of dubious&#13;
significance".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.4 Summary&#13;
The external efficiency of training programmes is frequently evaluated&#13;
using earnings data to calculate the private, social or corporate rate of&#13;
return. There are a number of thorny methodological problems associated with&#13;
such calculations. First, is there to be a control group or is a before/after&#13;
analysis of training sufficient? Second, it is necessary to track trainees&#13;
over a long enough time to measure the full inter-temporal impact of training&#13;
to see how rapidly the impact depreciates, or appreciates, with time. But&#13;
unfortunately such longitudinal data are seldom available. Third, rates of&#13;
return or benefit - cost ratios must be corrected to control for drop-outs&#13;
during the training and labour mobility after the training.&#13;
Even if these methodological problems are overcome there is a more&#13;
fundamental economic problem. The evaluations based on earnings assume,&#13;
implicitly or explicitly, that earnings are a good measure of productivity.&#13;
But this may not always be so. First, labour markets may be non-competitive.&#13;
Under internal labour market regimes in many large corporations experience-&#13;
pay profiles may diverge from experience-productivity profiles. Ability to&#13;
pay, represented by profitability or monopoly power in the product market&#13;
for example, and discrimination may also drive a wedge between pay and&#13;
productivity. Second, externalities may be pervasive. Although the standard&#13;
displacement and replacement problems may be less severe in corporate&#13;
training than in public training programmes, it is plausible that training&#13;
raises output of other labour than solely the trainee. It is particularly&#13;
difficult to measure such an effect. Third, the labour market may be in&#13;
disequilibrium. Labour shortages or surpluses may exist (though this does&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126-&#13;
not, as is sometimes asserted, invalidate rate of return anaysis).&#13;
Further, there is no reason to expect equality between pay and productivity&#13;
at all points on the experience profile.   Thus even though cosÂ§benefit&#13;
analysis is the superior method of evaluating trainin 9 any such evaluation&#13;
based on earnings data should be tentative in drawing its conc?usions.&#13;

SECTION 7&#13;
Output based and other evaluations of firm level vocational training&#13;
In addition to the use of earnings data to evaluate the external efficiency&#13;
of vocational training it is also oossible to use output and input measures.&#13;
In any before/after study or paired comparisons the unit of observation for&#13;
measuring output or inputs can either be the individual or the plant.&#13;
Measures of individual output include piecework earnings, performance rating&#13;
and quit propensities. Plant output and input measures include downtime,&#13;
physical units of output, the value of output and the cost of inputs. In&#13;
what follows we discuss: methods of evaluation, measurement of output and&#13;
input, and cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
7.1 Methods&#13;
Potentially, there are three ways to analyse the impact of training on&#13;
output or input. First, a single plant can be studied over time. The output&#13;
(however defined) or input prior to training can be compared with post-training&#13;
output. Naturally, other factors which also influence output must be taken&#13;
into account. In this method the "control" is the plant pre-training and the&#13;
"experimental" is the plant post-training. Second, twin plants could be studied&#13;
where the twins are, if possible, identical in all respects except that one has&#13;
training and the other does not. The output of the twins can then be compared.&#13;
Third, and much more complicated, a large cross section of plants in a particular&#13;
sector might be used to calculate a production function relating inputs to&#13;
outputs. Any attempt to isolate the impact of training via such a production&#13;
function would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Although this&#13;
Droduction function method is "best practice" we can get a long way using&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
l128-&#13;
short cuts, for example by examining the change In labour productivity&#13;
associated with training after controlling for any change in khe capital&#13;
input.  Let us spell out, briefly9, why a WorI6 Bank study des,,ied to get at&#13;
the impact of training should (for the time being) use the simp'@r before/&#13;
after or twin methods rather than attempt a full production funti&lt;on approach.&#13;
There are a number of general problems associated with esmting&#13;
production functions from a cross section of Plants. Further, there are&#13;
particular problems when the focus of attention is the impact of trained&#13;
labour on output. The general problems include:&#13;
sample size:  the problem here Is to lalance the increasing size of&#13;
the sample against the increasing heterogeneity of the plants in the&#13;
sample.&#13;
heterogeneity of the output; If different plants pro6C'e slWghtWy&#13;
different outputs how are we to cope with this heterog,cneity? In&#13;
fact this may be a minor probleFm TorpwOrd       financo   trainIng&#13;
because many Bank projects Involve quite homogeneous c:2tput like&#13;
electricity supply and road miles.&#13;
should output be measured gross or net?&#13;
how is capital to be defined and measured?&#13;
the production function approach assumes that across K ants the&#13;
production technique differs only by a scale factoro   ::n fact,&#13;
production techniques (e.g. capital to labour ratios) differ among&#13;
plants.&#13;
Even if these problems are solved there arc (at least) t&lt;o further inter-&#13;
related issues if the focus is the impact of trained labour c7 output or inputs.&#13;
First, trained labour will normally account for only a small (Jroportion of total&#13;
costs, therefore many of the other factors al fecting efficienCy drown out the&#13;
effects of using less and more trained tworkers. For example n,- electricity&#13;
supply capital surely mainly determ-fnes cutput across OWver stntiAons  so it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-129-&#13;
would be difficult to estimate the separate contribution on trained labour.&#13;
Second, and related, how dis-aggregated should the labour input be? The most&#13;
sophisticated study so far (Layard et al. 1971) started with labour split into&#13;
five skill categories but even when the labour input was aggregated to two&#13;
categories no association between skill and output could be detected.&#13;
It is a pity that the production function approach is likely to prove&#13;
difficult if the aim is to see whether, and to what extent, vocational training&#13;
influences output. If it worked it would provide two pieces of invaluable&#13;
information. First, the marginal product of skilled labour could be calculated.&#13;
This indicates the (short run) value of output produced by one extra unit of&#13;
skilled labour. In turn, this estimate can be compared with the unit cost of&#13;
training and a corporate or social rate of return to such training can be&#13;
calculated. Second, the production function approach permits an estimate of&#13;
the elasticity of substitution between different types of labour and between&#13;
labour and capital. This elasticity estimate indicates the (long run) impact&#13;
on factor prices (e.g. the wages of skilled to unskilled labour) as their&#13;
relative supplies change, or alternatively, how production techniques change&#13;
in the face of a change in factor prices.&#13;
Although the production function approach is too ambitious, at this stage,&#13;
to analyse the impact of much World Bank vocational training it is worth&#13;
pointing out that such an approach has proved useful at both a higher level of&#13;
aggregation and in the agricultural sector. Medoff (1982) examined the&#13;
relationship between U.S. manufacturing output at the 2-digit industry level&#13;
by state and two training variables, controlling for inputs of capital and&#13;
labour. The training variables refer to "employer-sponsored job related"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
training (ESJRT).  There appears to be no relationship between out D?house&#13;
training and labour productivity, but train`ng received at the place of tw?ork&#13;
has a positive impact on productivity.   There have aiso been a number of&#13;
studies of the relationship between farmer education and farm efficiency.    In&#13;
such studies output is related to capital9 labour, education 'levels9 extens`on&#13;
training and so forth and the sample is either Individual far.s or areas (TfO&#13;
a comprehensive survey see Lockheed, Jamison and Lau   '!980).  in Indonesia C&#13;
World Bank training project has introduced some farmers to ne@w irrigation&#13;
techniques.  It would be possible to use the production function approach to&#13;
compare the output of farmers using new technIques with those using more&#13;
traditional techniques.&#13;
One ingenious use of cross section data to get at the returns to training9&#13;
but without estimating a production function, is by Mingat (l93f).   The sample&#13;
was 52 worldwide agricultural projects supported by the 1:1orld 3ank in the&#13;
early 1980s. The output measure was the ratio of the actual rate oif return of&#13;
the project to the expected rate of return. This measure was related via&#13;
regression analysis to training costs9 technical assistance costs, per capita&#13;
GNP, adult literacy rate and region. The findings are clear. First9 the&#13;
return to project related training is very high, possibly ove, 200 per cent.&#13;
Second, the returns to training are bigger the higher is the .ult    iteracy&#13;
rate in the country. Although this method of evaluating the e,xternal&#13;
efficiency of training would not necessarily be appropriate il the aim is to&#13;
examine the extra output associated with training for any one particular&#13;
project it does provide a valuable framework for analysing the overall&#13;
efficiency of training to see whether in generalt project rel,ted training&#13;
should be expanded or contracted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-131-&#13;
7.2 Measures of output and input&#13;
Ideally any before/after study or paired comparison study relates the&#13;
value of the extra output or smaller input associated with training to its costs&#13;
to get a rate of return to training. But it may not be possible to do this.&#13;
First, if a plant-based measure of input or output is used many such measures&#13;
are expressed in physical units that do not translate easily to a money value.&#13;
Second, if individual-based output measures are used how is the teamwork problem&#13;
to be overcome? It is very difficult to trace output to particular individuals.&#13;
The problem has been described thus " ... in most cases where project-trained&#13;
persons work along with either untrained persons or persons trained under some&#13;
non-project programme it becomes impossible to identify separately the impact of&#13;
the project-supported training" (World Bank 1982, para. 5.01).&#13;
Five possible measures of training output which are individual based and do,&#13;
explicitly or implicitly, relate output to particular individuals are: (i)&#13;
piecework earnings, (ii) performance rating, (iii) earnings growth coupled with&#13;
performance rating, (iv) turnover and absenteeism rates, and (v) the ability to&#13;
pass a Government trade test. The first two are, potentially, the most fruitful&#13;
measures. The last two are illuminating but hardly central to training&#13;
associated with Bank projects.&#13;
Piecework earnings are presumably related to output (though, given the&#13;
variety of piece payment systems, the relationship is not necessarily linear).&#13;
Thus piece-earnings provide a bridge between the previous section on earnings-&#13;
based evaluations and this section on output-based evaluations. It may be&#13;
noted that piece-earnings are the only individual-based output measure which&#13;
permits a money cost-benefit calculation. The other individual-based output&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132,&#13;
measures only permit cost effectiveness calculailons.    Let us say a few words&#13;
about each of these.&#13;
Performance ratin by supervisors was discussed above. Xni a before/zftor&#13;
study, as long as the individual returns to the same grades t`.s provides a&#13;
ready made indicator of the effectiveness of 't'he training (assuming we are&#13;
content that the rating accurately measures performance).    If `The ,ndividuil&#13;
undergoing the training getspromotod it is then not clear how to use the rating&#13;
as a measure of cost effectiveness because his work is then iritrinsically more&#13;
responsible or difficult.&#13;
One way to test for the impact of training in a before/after study is to&#13;
use individuals in the firm(s) where the project is being unde-.-taken as the&#13;
unit of observation in a regression analysis.    The left hand sÂ°de (dependent&#13;
variable) is the change in piecework earnIngs or the chanqe in performance&#13;
rating over a period prior to and after training. The right hand side&#13;
(independent variables) include exposure to training (one or more variables in&#13;
dummy (yes/no) form) and various personal charatteristics   ndiates the fiqllAt&#13;
of project related training on plecework @arnings or performarce rating.&#13;
Alternatively, if we had before and afer individual infUoYrnation on the&#13;
change in earnings (any earnings, not just piece rate earnings) and perfoc.anen&#13;
rating we could do the following. put the change in earnings sn the lefthand si`C&#13;
Run the regression initially with just training variables and personal&#13;
characteristics on the right hand side. Next, introduce per`ormance rating&#13;
(which should itself be positively related to earnings growth). Xf the&#13;
estimated coefficients on the training variables are reduced by the intro&amp;uctMoe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133-&#13;
of the performance rating, this indicates that training is positively related&#13;
to performance (see Medoff 1982 for an application of this technique and some&#13;
extensions).&#13;
If training reduces the quit propensities of the labour force this&#13;
influences the duration of any benefits associated with training. In one of&#13;
the few firm-based studies (Thomas et al. 1969) the reduced labour turnover&#13;
associated with training had a far larger beneficial impact than the direct&#13;
output increase. It would be a straightforward matter to calculate quit rates&#13;
before and after training or between twin plants with and without training.&#13;
Some countries operate public trade tests for occupations like car&#13;
mechanic or carpenter (Godfrey 1977). To the extent that training relates to&#13;
occupations covered by the trade test the pass rate of those undergoing such&#13;
training could, in theory, be used as a cost effectiveness measure. In general,&#13;
however, Bank-financed training and trade tests are not coincident and there&#13;
is probably not much scope for such cost effectiveness studies.&#13;
Plant-based output or input measures, while not permitting us to relate&#13;
output to individuals, are more promising if the aim is to calculate a&#13;
comprehensive cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit indicator of firm level&#13;
training. It is probably better to work with an output measure rather than&#13;
with labour productivity because accurate changes in labour productivity are&#13;
difficult to measure. For example, if a firm hired its own maintenance&#13;
workers rather than sub-contracting maintenance at the very time the training&#13;
programme was introduced, the unwary might associate the training programme&#13;
with a reduction in labour productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Downtime is one possible output measure. Downtime variab'is include:&#13;
downtime which disrupts output (though the impact of such 6OWntime may depend&#13;
on the time of day or year); the cost/time for maintenance; the wear and&#13;
tear on the machines.   In each case it is possible to capital ise the value of&#13;
unused machinery and compare this with the cost of training.&#13;
The best output measure, and really the only one if it is desired to&#13;
estimate the firm's rate of return to the training, is simply ;he value of&#13;
extra output associated-twith training.  It might be possible to calculate&#13;
a "success rate" for the training defined as the actual output achieved&#13;
compared with the expected output.   However, there are problems in&#13;
calculating the value of output in any before/after study. For example, it&#13;
is necessary to control for aggregate inflation.   Then again, one must decide&#13;
whether or not to value the output in constant prices - `.@o t0 control for&#13;
any change in the structure of relative prices over time. An additional&#13;
problem in a before/after study is whether or not any change iii output is&#13;
demand-determined. For example, say port capacity is 100 ships per month but&#13;
it was previously only working at two thirds capacity because Of lack of&#13;
demand.  By coincidence, just after training is completed, demand increases&#13;
so that it can now work full capacity.   In such a case we must be careful not&#13;
to attribute the increase in output to the training. Finally, in this measu:re&#13;
of output, as in all others, it is necessary to make assumptions concerning&#13;
the duration of the output increase associated with the training: should w2&#13;
assume, for example, that it will continue into the indefinite future?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135-&#13;
The main benefits of vocational training may come in the form of cost&#13;
reductions rather than output increases. For example Shiba (1983) indicates&#13;
that training which raises skill levels in thermal power stations has three&#13;
possible types of saving. First, fuel costs might be reduced by improving&#13;
thermal efficiency. Second, repair costs will tend to be cut by quicker&#13;
discovery and rectification of failures and accidents. Third, manpower inputs&#13;
are likely to be reduced because operators have more diversified skills and&#13;
there are fewer accidents and failures needing attention.&#13;
7.3 Benefits and costs&#13;
The benefits of vocational training can be weighed against the costs&#13;
using the rate of return calculation or other measures outlined in Table 6.1.&#13;
The major factors to be included in any such rate of return of similar&#13;
calculation are set out in Table 7.1. As usual, the cost calculations are&#13;
probably more straightforward than the measurement of benefits. For the firm&#13;
the cost calculations are reasonably straightforward. One factor not&#13;
explicitly included in the relevant box is the cost to the firm of any&#13;
informal training on-the-job, but the firm-based studies of Ryan (1980) and&#13;
Thomas et al. (1969) show that it may be possible to make such estimates.&#13;
(For a clear exposition of costs see Arriagazzi 1972). The one real problem&#13;
in the corporate cost calculation concerns the value of production during&#13;
training. This might be calculated as follows:&#13;
Production rate of trainee      Average earnings of qualified worker&#13;
(as proportion of that of    x  (on the assumption that this represents&#13;
a qualified worker)             the productive value of a qualified worker)&#13;
But such a calculation turns on knowing the production rate of the trainee and&#13;
on the correctness of the assumption that the earnings of the qualified worker&#13;
represent his true worth.&#13;

Calculating the benefits to the firm is more problematic.    It should be&#13;
possible to calculate the value of output post training less what it would have&#13;
been without the training, proxied by pre-training output. But from this&#13;
increment in the value of output we must deduct the element paid in higher wages&#13;
to those with training, and other workers if there are knock-on effects in the&#13;
internal labour market. This is set out in Figure 7.1. The increment in the&#13;
value of production associated with training is ab but the firm pays out ac of&#13;
this to its workforce, leaving bc for the firm itself. If the higher output&#13;
depends on the workers remaining with the firm bc must in turn be multiplied by&#13;
the retention rate of those who experience the training. (It is worth noting&#13;
in passing that this calculation of benefits may be more accurate than the&#13;
corresponding information using earnings, which assumes that earnings adequately&#13;
represent the value of output. Thus Cohen (1983) was forced to assume that the&#13;
earnings of qualified workers represented the value of output post training and&#13;
that newly-minted trainees got paid substantially less than their true worth,&#13;
for up to twenty years. But here we deal with the actual value of output or&#13;
inputs saved - road miles, electricity supply and so forth - before and after&#13;
training and do not need to make such arbitrary assumptions).&#13;
Benefits of training may flow to the firm in the form of reduced inputs&#13;
rather than higher output. Thus in his study of a power plant owned by the&#13;
Tokyo Electric Power Company, Shiba (1983) reports a training benefit - cost&#13;
ratio of 8-1. The benefits were not from lower fuel or repair costs but rather&#13;
from a large reduction in workers per shift. In the particular power plant&#13;
under study manpower per shift was cut from 18 in 1965 to 8 in 1982. Of this&#13;
reduction in 10 people per shift, 3 were attributable to improvements in capital&#13;
and 7 were attributable to the long run effect of the training programme.&#13;

The benefits to society are, as usual, difficult to calculate. First,&#13;
spillover effects are likely to be large because much training will benefit&#13;
other firms as trained workers leave. In some instances the trained workers&#13;
will migrate abroad leaving no direct training benefits but indirect benefits&#13;
via remittances home. Second, it is assumed that the increment between pre-&#13;
training and post-training output represents the social benefit of the training.&#13;
But changes over time in various institutional arrangements and market failures&#13;
(e.g. the degree of regulation a utility faces in its pricing policy) may imply&#13;
that the change in the value of output is a misleading measure of the benefits&#13;
to society. Third, a true multiplier effect may exist: more road miles of&#13;
better electricity supply may permit higher employment and income in the rest&#13;
of the economy than would be possible with other uses of the resources used in&#13;
road construction or electricity supply. Fourth, there will be a substantial&#13;
positive externality if the trained person raises the productivity of those he&#13;
works with in the firm (although this effect is captured by using the increment&#13;
in the value of output as the benefit measure). The other externalities which&#13;
plague cost benefit analysis of public training programmes - displacement and&#13;
replacement - are not likely to be important with World Bank financed training&#13;
because it is firm-based and embraces existing employees.&#13;
The calculation of the private benefits and costs of firm-level training&#13;
is relatively straightforward. If the individuals are still in the firm,&#13;
providing the firm has records of earnings it is a simple matter to calculate&#13;
a private rate of return. Even if training was done some time ago and most&#13;
training was institutional it should be possible to find an institution which&#13;
keeps records of its students and then trace them and via a retrospective&#13;
survey to calculate the payoff to the training that they received.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Any before/after study or twin study must attempt to controq3 for factors&#13;
other than training which influence output or input savings.   F:rst9 is cGpit&amp;a&#13;
unchanged? Any increase in output must not be attributed to training if, in&#13;
fact, it is due to more and better equipment. Presumab)y tralning rt~i often&#13;
go hand in hand with changes in capital.   It may 22 possible to measure and&#13;
control for any change in capital in a before/after study of onc2 firm  (athough&#13;
this would be difficult if the train'Ing ccmponnnt of a projoct  s handin-hand&#13;
with new plant). In any wider cross section it may be `mpossib?@ to measure&#13;
capital accurately.  In such cross section studies capilal may be bast&#13;
represented using Zymelman's (197S) Ingenious proxy, the orgaaisatlon of jobs&#13;
in the plant.&#13;
Second, is the labour input constant?   For examp'le  it is necessary to&#13;
control for the length of the workweelk, the organlsation of shiits, and changes&#13;
in the education level of the labour force (independent of traning).   Perhaps&#13;
most important, experience levels must be controliled for becauso it is possible&#13;
output would have increased anyway (independent of training) simpSly because the&#13;
labour force is gaining extra experience0&#13;
Third, is the management input constant?   For example, have, there been any&#13;
changes in the organisational structure such as job content and lines of&#13;
communication? Has there been a move towards an intornal labao: n market In&#13;
terms of recruitment and promotion policy.   [las the motivation and performanca&#13;
of the workforce improved independenitly of training?&#13;
The single before/after study can indicatc the payoff to t'hat particular&#13;
form of training but it says nothing about then relative mrits of dYifferent&#13;
forms (e.g. on/off the job) of vocational training.   To make comparisons by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-&#13;
different types of vocational training requires either before/after studies in&#13;
two plants which are similar, except for type of training or a larger cross&#13;
section where output can be related to type of training using statistical&#13;
controls for other influences on output. Such studies would begin to permit&#13;
us to compare the relative merits of (for example)&#13;
- getting an already trained person from abroad&#13;
- training someone with some education, either on/off the job&#13;
- training an illiterate, either on/off the job&#13;
Such a study would indicate different amounts of added training costs, because&#13;
plants will differ in the amount of skilled labour they already have. Further, -&#13;
it would permit us to compare the relative merits of different types of&#13;
vocational training such as passive exposure (work experience) and planned,&#13;
programmed and supervised training.&#13;
7.4 Summary&#13;
Training may affect either output or inputs. There are three methods of&#13;
analysing the impact of training on output. First, one plant can be studied&#13;
before and after training. Second, twin plants can be studied, similar in all&#13;
respects except that one has the training to evaluate and one does not. Third,&#13;
a production function can be estimated, across a sample of plants, relating&#13;
inputs, including training, to output.&#13;
The unit of observation can be either the individual or the plant.&#13;
Individual-based output measures which would be useful in evaluating training&#13;
include piecework earnings and performance rating. Using a sample of individuals&#13;
the change in piecework earnings or performance rating before and after training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_142-&#13;
can be related personal characteristics such as education and experience and&#13;
to a variable which captures whether or not an individual has been exposed to&#13;
training.  Plant based output or input measures probably offer more promise&#13;
if the aim is to estimate a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit iqeasure of firm&#13;
level training.  Reductions in downtime, extra output and lower 'input costs&#13;
should, in principle, all be measurabile ard might thcn be related to training&#13;
A rate of return to firm level training can be calculated '?or the firms&#13;
the individual and society.  The major measurement problem in any such&#13;
calculation concerns benefits, in particular it is difficult to pln dotm what&#13;
would have happened without the training.   In additions the w,der social return&#13;
must take account of the impact of the tralned labour on output elsewhere in&#13;
the economy.&#13;

            The economics of vocational training : past

            This paper: (i) presents a partial
            survey of the literature on the economics of vocational
            training to draw some lessons for evaluations; and (ii)
            indicates how much evaluations may be undertaken using data
            on pay, inputs and outputs. There are three important
            lessons. First, social, corporate and private returns to
            vocational training in developing countries appear to be
            high enough to justify expanding training activity. However,
            training in industrial institutes and vocational secondary
            schools is less cost-effective than more informal firm-based
            training, at least in Kenya, India and Israel. Also, Latin
            American data indicate that there may be substitutability
            between schooling and formal institutional vocational
            training. Second, in some sectors a more labour-intensive
            method of production is economically more efficient than
            current methods. Third, sophisticated production function
            analyses are plagued by statistical and measurement
            problems. Training can be evaluated using earnings data or
            output and input data. In all cases there are technical
            problems. In the face of such problems with earnings data a
            simpler before/after plant level study of changes in inputs
            or output associated with training may offer the most
            tractable evaluation method.
